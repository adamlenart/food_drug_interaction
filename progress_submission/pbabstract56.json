    "0": "Ischemic acute renal failure is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction. We examined whether vasodilatory antihypertensive agents would improve endothelial function in rats with ischemia/reperfusion renal injury. Rat kidneys were isolated and perfused after clipping of the bilateral renal arteries for 45 min and reperfusion for 24 h, and renal perfusion pressure and nitric oxide concentration in the venous effluent (chemiluminescence assay) were monitored. Preischemic administration of celiprolol (a beta-blocker; 100 mg/kg p.o.), benidipine (a calcium channel blocker; 1 mg/kg p.o.), or imidapril (an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor; 3 mg/kg p.o.) restored endothelial function in rats subjected to acute renal ischemia (deltarenal perfusion pressure [10(-8) M acetylcholine]: sham -42+/-3%, ischemia -31+/-1%, ischemia +celiprolol -39+/-1%*, ischemia+benidipine -38+/-2%*, ischemia+imidapril -42+/-2%*; *p<0.05 vs. ischemia). Serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were also lower in the treated groups. Furthermore, ischemia-induced decreases in the response to acetylcholine and renal excretory function were smaller in SHR than in deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertensive rats, in which endothelial damage was marked. These results suggest that preischemic endothelial function may influence the degree of ischemic renal injury. Calcium channel blockers, converting-enzyme inhibitors, and endothelial NO synthase-activating beta-blockers had beneficial effects on renovascular endothelial dysfunction due to ischemia.", 
    "1": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) may have different effects on cardiac hypertrophy than on vascular hypertrophy. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) may promote cardiac hypertrophy. Our aims were (1) to simultaneously examine the chronic effects of ACEIs on hypertrophy of the heart and hypertrophy of the coronary and renal interlobular arteries, and (2) to clarify the relation between AVP concentration (AVPC) and cardiac hypertrophy. ACEI (delapril: 30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (5% arabic gum) was administered in a preventive (4 to 28 weeks of age) or a therapeutic (12-24 weeks of age) protocol in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In both protocols, delapril produced a slight but significant decrease in systolic blood pressure. In the therapeutic protocol, the weight of the left ventricle (mean+/-SE) was lower (p<0.05) in the ACEI group (64+/-2 mg/100 g body weight) than in the control group (69+/-1 mg/100 g body weight). Plasma renin activity was significantly higher in the ACEI group than in the control group in both the preventive (p <0.01) and therapeutic (p<0.01) protocols. In the therapeutic protocol, AVPC was significantly (p<0.05) lower in the ACEI group than in the control group. AVPC was significantly (p=0.02, r=0.46) correlated with the weight of the left ventricle in the therapeutic protocol. For both protocols, no differences were noted between the ACEI and control groups in the vascular hypertrophy of the coronary and renal interlobular arteries. We conclude that (1) the preventive or therapeutic effect of ACEIs on hypertrophy may not be the same in the heart as in the coronary and renal arteries; and (2) AVP was significantly correlated with the left ventricular weight. This indicates that AVP could play a role in the etiology of cardiac hypertrophy in SHR.", 
    "2": "Although medical therapy, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, has been demonstrated to prolong life in patients with chronic heart failure, the effect of standard medical therapy on sudden unexpected death in patients with heart failure is less well understood. Recent clinical trials have provided new insights into this growing problem. The impact of modern medical therapy for heart failure, including ACE inhibitors, beta-adrenergic antagonists, digoxin, calcium channel antagonists, and antiarrhythmic interventions will be discussed.", 
    "3": "Clearly, sudden cardiac death syndrome in heart failure is linked to severely perturbed neurohumoral, hemodynamic, and mechanical systems. Routine antiarrhythmic drug therapy has not proven beneficial and, therefore, there is no justification for using these agents in unselected heart failure patients who are without significant symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia. Aggressive treatment of the failure syndrome seems most important. Because many of the problematic arrhythmias arise from triggering automaticity, which is known to occur in excessive ventricular stretch and wall stress, systemic vascular \"unloading\" with vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is likely helpful. The most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines regarding therapeutic management of heart failure suggest that aggressive pharmacologic treatment of asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias is best avoided. To be considered strongly for pharmacologic prescription or for implantation of a tachyarrhythmia termination device, a patient should have symptomatic ventricular tachycardia with an episode of syncope or sudden cardiac death syndrome rather than simply having palpitations of asymptomatic, unsustained ventricular tachycardia. Indeed, aggressively treating congestive heart failure with medication often eliminates potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Appropriate use of vasodilators and, particularly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is important. Correction of fluid balance and electrolyte disorders may be helpful to address symptoms and certainly is likely to decrease the potential for morbidity and mortality. On occasion it may be necessary to consider bradyarrhythmia pacemaker insertion or the use of atrioventricular nodal-ablation techniques with subsequent ventricular or atrioventricular pacer insertion. Obviously, sudden cardiac death due to sudden heart block or asystole might be attenuated with this strategy.",

Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for bradykinin degradation was found to enhance the endothelium-dependent relaxation by BK.

    "5": "Endothelium intact porcine coronary artery rings were studied in organ chambers. The rings were isometrically contracted with potassium chloride (30 mmol/L) and the response to BK (1 to 1,000 nmol/L)-induced relaxation was investigated in the presence of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (300 micromol/L) alone and in combination with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 micromol/L), and that of the inhibitor of calcium-dependent potassium channels tetraethylammonium (7 mmol/L). Under these conditions, phosphoramidon (10 micromol/L), an inhibitor of a neutral endopeptidase enzyme (EC.3.4.24.11.), which is responsible for the degradation of BK, was used to enhance the endothelium-dependent relaxation.",

This review focuses on the results of these trials as well as randomised trials with pharmacological therapy of microalbuminuria, primary prevention with acetylsalicylic acid and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The overall results from these trials are clinically relevant reductions in the risk of late diabetic complications. Taken together, the new clinical knowledge does not mean that all patients with type 2-diabetes besides relevant changes in lifestyle will benefit from a comprehensive polypharmacy. It means, however, that based upon the individual risk profile the medical professionals have to motivate the patient for an evidence based \"therapeutic package\" which is likely to improve the longterm outcome.",

The compound is of interest because of its use as an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Polymorph A crystallizes in space group P2(I)/c, Z = 4, with unit cell parameters a = 18.7798(3), b = 18.1043(2), and c = 8.00578(7) A, beta = 97.066(1) degrees, and V = 2701.31 A(3).

Omapatrilat and its metabolites (phenylmercaptopropionic acid, S-methylomapatrilat, S-methylphenylmercaptopropionic acid, and cyclic S-oxide-omapatrilat) were quantified in plasma by a validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method. The model, Cmax or AUC(0-T) = intercept + slope x CLCR, was tested for a possible linear correlation between Cmax (peak plasma concentrations) or AUC(0-T) (area under plasma concentration versus time curve) and CLCR.",

After Cmax attainment, plasma concentrations declined rapidly to about 10% of Cmax values. Cyclic S-oxide-omapatrilat, a potentially active metabolite, was undetectable at all sampling time points. Hemodialysis did not decrease circulating levels of omapatrilat. There was minimal accumulation of omapatrilat and phenylmercaptopropionic acid and moderate accumulation of the S-methylated metabolites. For omapatrilat and S-methylphenylmercaptopropionic acid, neither Cmax nor AUC(0-T) was CLCR dependent. However, AUC(0-T) for phenylmercaptopropionic acid and both the Cmax and AUC(0-T) for S-methylomapatrilat were CLCR dependent.",

    "20": "Recently, serious concerns have been expressed about the long-term safety of the calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as a group. Safety and efficacy are, however, ultimately linked to each other; therefore both must be evaluated especially in the therapy of angina and hypertension, the main clinical indications for CCBs. The structural, functional, and pharmacokinetic heterogeneity of CCBs means that the efficacy and dangers of one subclass, such as the short-acting dihydropyridines (DHPs), in one situation, such as unstable angina, do not necessarily apply in other clinical situations. One hundred studies are reviewed according to their methods of data collection: case series, case control, cohort, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and meta-analyses. Large, well-designed RCTs and the meta-analyses based on these trials remain the gold standard. Observational studies, though potentially less reliable sources of information because of selection bias, may nevertheless produce hypotheses that must then be tested in RCTs. Regarding safety, both observational studies and RCTs suggest that adverse effects of CCBs may be linked to short-acting agents, specifically short-acting nifedipine. Two good studies favor the safety of verapamil, even in short-acting form. Incomplete but increasing overall evidence favors the safety of longer-acting DHPs. Heart failure remains a class contraindication to the use of all CCBs, with some exceptions. Regarding efficacy, there are positive results of RCTs with CCBs in 2 specific clinical situations, namely, verapamil in postinfarct protection in the absence of pre-existing heart failure, and 2 outcome studies on hypertension with longer acting DHPs. These results cannot automatically be applied to other clinical situations and to other CCBs. For example, there is no evidence for the safety or efficacy of DHPs used without beta blockers in postinfarct patients. In diabetic hypertensives, 2 relatively large RCTs show that the blood pressure can be reduced by DHP-based therapy in diabetics, with a reduction in hard end points. To achieve current blood pressure goals, combination therapy is almost always necessary, and in diabetics there is strong evidence that 1 essential component should be an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The future aim with CCBs must be to obtain a large database gathered from RCTs, which will give the same certainty about efficacy and safety that already holds for use of the diuretics in hypertension, beta-blockers in postmyocardial infarction patients, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure.", 
    "21": "A series of studies was conducted in healthy young males and healthy elderly males or females to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of telmisartan. In addition, two phase-II clinical trials assessed the pharmacokinetics and the safety of telmisartan in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients. Telmisartan was given as a single oral (1-160 mg) or intravenous (10-160 mg) dose to young males. In another multiple-dose study, telmisartan 320 mg was administered orally once daily for 7 days to healthy young male subjects. Elderly subjects received oral telmisartan (20 and 120 mg) once daily for 7 days. Telmisartan doses of 10, 20, 40, 80, 120 and 160 mg were taken once daily by mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients for 7 days. Additionally, oral telmisartan (40, 80 or 120 mg) was administered once daily for 28 days to hypertensive subjects. Following oral dosing, median time to maximum plasma telmisartan concentration was 0.5 - 2 h, with maximum plasma concentrations increasing disproportionately with dose. By contrast, plasma concentrations were directly related to the intravenous dose. Steady state was observed after 5-7 days of once-daily administration, and there was no clinically relevant accumulation at 28 days. The plasma concentration-time profiles were similar in all study groups and were characterized by fast absorption and a rapid biexponential decline after the peak plasma concentration, with a prolonged terminal elimination phase (> 20 h in healthy and hypertensive subjects). Telmisartan was well tolerated, with a low incidence of drug-related adverse events. The most frequent event was headache, which also occurred in placebo-treated control subjects. No changes in heart rate, electrocardiograms or clinical chemistry were detected following receipt of telmisartan. The study thus shows that high systemic levels of telmisartan, which are well tolerated, can be attained in healthy adults of any age and in hypertensive subjects. The long terminal elimination half-life makes telmisartan suitable for once-daily dosing and contributes to the sustained efficacy over the full 24-h dosing interval.",

    "24": "In the context of a European Study (IMPROVEMENT of HF Study), in 1999, the treatment of 474 patients with symptomatic CHF was recorded by chart review with primary care physicians throughout Switzerland. The effect of potential predictors of drug treatment was tested using multivariate logistic regression.", 
    "25": "Mean age of the study population was 75 +/- 12 years. Overall, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were prescribed to 65% of the study population. Beta-blockers, loop diuretics/thiazides, spironolactone and digitalis were prescribed to 25%, 73%, 13% and 31% respectively. Compared with CHF patients < 65 years of age, the odds ratio of ACE-I/ARB prescription in patients aged 65-74, 75-84, and > or = 85 years was 0.80, 0.58 and 0.40 respectively (p < 0.001). The respective odds ratios for beta blocker treatment were 0.37, 0.21 and 0.06 (p < 0.001). In addition, NYHA classification, comorbid conditions such as renal failure and contraindications strongly predicted drug prescription. Gender and geographical area were not associated with drug selection.", 
    "26": "Overall drug prescription among CHF patients in Swiss primary care appears to be satisfactory. However, prescription of ACE-I/ARB and beta-blockers falls steeply with increasing age, independent of measured comorbid conditions and contraindications. Thus, improvement of treatment should focus on a more consistent use of these drugs in the segment of elderly CHF patients.", 
    "27": "Optimal pharmacologic management of hypertension cannot be limited to the consideration of physiologic and metabolic profiles. The impact of antihypertensive drug treatment on quality of life is also of primary concern because it affects patient compliance and therapeutic outcome. Fortunately, quality-of-life measures are increasingly being used in clinical trials of antihypertensive agents (and other drugs). Such studies have revealed that on the whole, antihypertensive drug therapy has a slightly favorable impact on sleep, psychomotor skills, general well-being, and mood. Individually, however, antihypertensive agents from the same class have subtly different effects on various quality-of-life parameters. Interestingly, patients' perception of changes in their quality of life often diverges widely from their physician's perception and those of their spouse, relatives, and friends- so who administers the measures to whom is an important consideration. Refinement of quality-of-life measures plus a wide selection of antihypertensive agents promises increased flexibility in drug regimen design to physicians who treat hypertensive patients.", 
    "28": "Poor control of hypertension is common, but its causes are not always easy to discern and thus are often not readily corrected. A well-known cause of poor blood pressure control is poor patient adherence to therapy. Reliance on short-acting antihypertensive drugs may contribute to both problems. According to various clinical trials, more even blood pressure control can be achieved with long-acting antihypertensive agents administered once daily. Given these agents' ease of dosing and persistence of effect, their use is likely to improve adherence and control. Physicians can also have a positive impact by providing patient education that stresses the importance of patients' long-term adherence to their prescribed drug regimen even in the absence of symptoms. Moreover, they can create an atmosphere in which patients feel free to voice their concerns about their disease, ask questions about their drug regimen, and discuss any adverse effects or recommended lifestyle changes that may be undermining their adherence to the therapy prescribed.", 
    "29": "Diabetes and hypertension frequently coexist, with effects potentially more detrimental than those of either condition alone. The combination increases the risk of both cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. Antihypertensive drug therapy is of benefit to both nondiabetic and diabetic patients, but the greatest reduction in risk is seen in those with diabetes. Studies have shown the cardiorenal protective effects of therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors either alone or combined with calcium channel blockers. The data indicated the need for screening of hypertensive patients for diabetes and aggressive treatment to control hypertension.", 
    "30": "Not so long ago the structure and function of the endothelium were of no concern to physicians intent on preventing atherosclerosis and its life-threatening sequelae in their patients. Unexpectedly, researchers have found that this supposedly inert cell line controls many important processes, including maintenance of blood vessel compliance. During the early stages of atherosclerosis and even before the onset of borderline hypertension, its vasodilative function is impaired because of an increase in its permeability to lipoproteins and other plasma constituents. Oxidized lipoproteins inhibit the release of the vasodilative substance nitric oxide, and angiotensin II degrades bradykinin, a potent stimulator of nitric oxide production in endothelial cells that is known to protect against atherosclerosis. Fortunately, preclinical and clinical study data strongly suggest that therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can reverse endothelial dysfunction by decreasing angiotensin II levels and increasing bradykinin and, in turn, nitric oxide levels.",

Mean levels of CRP and fibrinogen were elevated in microalbuminuric (N = 262) versus normoalbuminuric (N = 1219) subjects (5.37 +/- 0.47 vs. 3.80 +/- 0.15 mg/L and 295.7 +/- 4. 0 vs. 278.2 +/- 1.6 mg/dL, both P < 0.0001). The associations were consistent among nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects and among the three ethnic groups of the IRAS (non-Hispanic whites, blacks, Hispanics). In a logistic regression model, fibrinogen was independently associated with microalbuminuria (P = 0.047), along with hypertension, female gender, waist circumference, and fasting blood glucose, while CRP was not independently related to microalbuminuria in this model (P = 0.26).",

    "37": "In normal and sham-operated rat kidneys, OPN was expressed in a few tubules (<5%) and was absent in glomeruli.

The up-regulation of OPN expression was associated with macrophage accumulation within the kidney, severe proteinuria, loss of renal function, and severe histologic damage, including tubulitis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (all P < 0.001). Treatment with either valsartan or ramipril completely abrogated the up-regulation of OPN mRNA and protein expression in glomeruli and tubules. The reduction in OPN expression was associated with a significant inhibition of macrophage accumulation and progressive renal injury (P < 0.001).",

    "39": "An immunodominant epitope of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gp160 recognized by Dd class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule-restricted, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was originally identified as a peptide composed of 15 amino acids (P18IIIB: RIQRGPGRAFVTIGK). However, further study has indicated that a 10-mer peptide, I-10 (RGPGRAFVTI), within P18IIIB is the minimal-sized epitope and the trimming step(s) of two carboxyl terminal amino acids (GK) is essential to produce I-10 from P18IIIB. In the processing, angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE), found in sera, plays a central role in generating I-10. Target cells could be sensitized with I-10 under conditions where ACE activity in the sera was abrogated. In contrast, in the case of P18IIIB, requiring further processing to delete the C-terminus of two amino acids in order to act, sensitization of target cells was completely abrogated under the conditions. Pretreatment of target cells with brefeldin A (BFA), preventing the presentation of endogenous antigens from the class I MHC molecule pathway, did not inhibit the presentation of P18IIIB. Moreover, glutaraldehyde-fixed cells, which can not process native protein, though they could present the exogenously added peptides, were also sensitized by P18IIIB. These results clearly demonstrate that the fine processing to produce I-10 occurred in the extracellular milieu. Furthermore, our result suggests that the longer P18IIIB can bind to the class I molecules on the cell surface, and then be trimmed by ACE while it is bound. The mechanisms behind the extracellular processing outlined in this paper will offer important information for designing peptide-based vaccines to elicit MHC molecule-restricted effectors.",

After single oral doses of Z13752A, ACE inhibition appeared to be significant at all the doses tested, linearly correlated with the dose and was almost complete at doses > or = 100-200 mg. NEP inhibition was indicated by elevation of ANP and cGMP plasma concentrations in almost all subjects. In the 200-800 mg dose range, Z13752A produced a 50-100% increase of plasma cGMP levels and a 50-80% elevation in urinary cGMP concentrations. Detectable plasma levels of Z13752A were found in all the treated subjects. Z13752A was well and rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations reached approximately 2.5 h after administration.

Twenty-nine adult dogs with membranous (n = 16) and membranoproliferative (n = 13) GN were studied. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either EN (0.5 mg/kg PO q12-24h; n = 16) or placebo (n = 14) for 6 months (1 dog was treated first with the placebo and then with EN). All dogs were treated with low-dose aspirin (0.5-5 mg/kg PO q12-24h) and fed a commercial diet. At baseline, serum creatinine (SrCr), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and glomerular histologic grade were not different between groups, but the urine protein/creatinine ratio (UP/C) was greater in the EN group compared with the placebo group (8.7 +/- 4.4 versus 4.7 +/- 2.3). After 6 months of treatment, the change in UP/C from baseline was significantly different between groups (EN = -4.2 +/- 1.4 versus 1.9 +/- 0.9 in the placebo group). When data were adjusted for changes in SrCr (SrCr X UP/C) a similar significant reduction was noted ( 2.2 +/- 15.2 versus 8.4 +/- 10.1). The change in SBP after 6 months of treatment also was significantly different between groups (EN = -12.8 +/- 27.3 versus 5.9 +/- 21.5 mm Hg in the placebo group). Response to treatment was categorized as improvement (assigned a value of 2), no progression (assigned a value of 1), and progression (assigned a value of 0). Response was significantly better in the EN group (1.4 +/- 0.8) compared with the placebo group (0.3 +/- 0.5). These results suggest that EN treatment is beneficial in dogs with naturally occurring idiopathic GN.", 
    "45": "The use of low-sodium diets in dogs with heart failure is common practice, but randomized, double-blind studies have not been conducted to examine the benefits or problems with this approach. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a low-sodium diet on clinical, echocardiographic, and neurohormonal parameters in dogs with heart failure. Dogs with stable chronic heart failure were fed exclusively a low-sodium (LS) and a moderate-sodium (MS) diet for 4 weeks each in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. At days 0, 28, and 56, echocardiography and thoracic radiography were performed, and blood was analyzed for electrolytes and neurohormones. Fourteen dogs completed the study (9 with chronic valvular disease and 5 with dilated cardiomyopathy). Electrolyte abnormalities were common during the study, and serum sodium and chloride concentrations decreased significantly on the LS diet. Neurohormones did not change significantly between diet groups. Maximum left atrial (P = .05) and standard left atrial (P = .09) size decreased on the LS diet. For dogs with chronic valvular disease, vertebral heart score (P = .05), left ventricular internal dimension in diastole (P = .006) and systole (P = .02), standard left atrial dimension (P = .03), maximum left atrial dimension (P = .02), end-diastolic volume index (P = .02), and end-systolic volume index (P = .04) decreased significantly on the LS diet compared to the MS diet. Although analysis of these data suggests some benefits of a low-sodium diet, future studies with improved study design are needed to further evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of sodium restriction in dogs with heart failure.",

    "50": "This study investigates the effects of exogenous and endogenous nitric oxide (NO) on human circulating and endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and platelet aggregation. The NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (10(-8)-10(-6) M) significantly and dose-dependently inhibited serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. The concomitant addition of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-treated (captopril or enalaprilat) serum, further reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. In cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical veins (HUVECs), both S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) significantly reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. An additative effect was seen with a combined treatment of captopril and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. Treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) did not affect angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. Thrombin inhibited endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, an effect that was abolished when cells were pretreated with L-NMMA. Adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, SIN-1 and nitroglycerine. Captopril did not affect aggregation, while a high concentration of enalaprilat (10(-4) M) reduced it. The concomitant addition of 10(-5) M angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to NO donor-treated platelets resulted in a further reduction of platelet aggregation. This effect was most evident with SIN-1 and enalaprilat. In conclusion, both exogenous and endogenous NO inhibit human angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. NO donors and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors act in concert to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme and platelet aggregation.",

Collagen degradation was induced by double infusion of oxidized glutathione (GSSG rats; CVF = 2.45 +/- 0.52, hydroxyproline = 2.85 +/- 0.18). Nine untreated rats were used as controls (CFV = 3.04 +/- 0.58, hydroxyproline = 3.21 +/- 0.30).

In GSSG and RHTR groups the passive tension-length curves were shifted downwards, indicating decreased passive stiffness, and upwards, indicating increased passive stiffness, respectively. Decreased collagen content induced by GSSG is related to myocyte hypertrophy, decreased passive stiffness, and increased AS, and increased collagen concentration causes myocardial diastolic dysfunction with no effect on systolic function.",

    "53": "Using our model relating angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor dosing and outcomes in heart failure (HF), we designed a prospective intervention trial for patients with systolic dysfunction. A clinical pharmacist initiated or titrated ACE inhibitor therapy or adjusted other medications within an HF management program based on Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research guidelines. Entry into the protocol required the approval of the attending physician. All patients received dietary, nursing, rehabilitation, social service, and clinical pharmacy consultations. Treatment conformed to Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research guidelines in 25% of patients (group A). Suboptimal therapy (75% of patients) was usually due to failure to administer an ACE inhibitor (48%) or inadequate dosing of an ACE inhibitor (46%). In 62% of suboptimal cases, the attending physician agreed to follow the clinical pharmacist's recommendations (group B). Patients of physicians who declined pharmacist intervention served as a negative control (group C). On admission, mean enalapril-equivalent daily doses in groups A, B, and C were 30, 4, and 6 mg, respectively, and at discharge, 36, 18, and 6 mg, respectively. At 180 days, rehospitalization frequency and total charges were lower in groups A (31% and $5,600) and B (35% and $3,800) than in group C (63% [p <0.004] and $9,800 [p <0.04]). Thus, optimization of ACE inhibitor doses by a clinical pharmacist can greatly improve rehospitalization rates and significantly lower cost of care in an HF management program.", 
    "54": "Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH) from Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, was inactivated by treatment with myeloperoxidase (MPO)-dependent systems. LADH lipoamide reductase and diaphorase activities decreased as a function of incubation time and composition of the MPO/H2O2/halide system, a transient increase preceding the loss of diaphorase activity. Iodide, bromide, thiocyanide and chloride were effective components of MPO/H2O2 or MPO/NADH systems. Catalase prevented LADH inactivation by the MPO/NADH/halide systems in agreement with H2O2 production by NADH-supplemented LADH. Thiol compounds (L-cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, penicillamine, N-(2-mercaptopropionylglycine) and Captopril prevented LADH inactivation by the MPO/H2O2/NaCl system and by NaOCl, thus supporting HOCl as agent of the MPO/H2O2/NaCl system. MPO/H2O2/NaNO2 and MPO/NADH/NaNO2 inactivated LADH, the reaction being prevented by MPO inhibitors and thiol compounds. T. cruzi LADH was affected by MPO-dependent systems like myocardial LADH, allowance being made for the variation of the diaphorase activity and the greater sensitivity of the T. cruzi enzyme to MPO/H2O2/halide systems.",

The study was undertaken to investigate the different influence of ACE inhibitors on the remodeling of the left ventricle after AMI or PMI. 52 patients (Pt.) (17 female, 38-73 years) were randomized to receive either 25-75 mg/day captopril (C) or 5-20 mg/day fosinopril (F) beginning on day 7 after acute myocardial infarction. 28 Pt. had AMI, 24 Pt. PMI. Infarct size was determined by the creatine kinase integral method. 50 Pt. were examined by cine magnetic resonance imaging 1 and 26 weeks after infarction.

    "70": "The combination of dilatation and systolic dysfunction of the left or both ventricles from idiopathic or specific origin define dilated cardiomyopathy (DC). It is an important cause of cardiac morbidity through congestive heart failure (CHF) or arrhythmias. Prevalence studies estimate a rate of left ventricular systolic dysfunction of 2% to 3% or more, and of 1.5% of CHF among the general population. Genetic studies on familial DC have identified at least 5 genetic locus. In addition, the role of virus, genetic abnormalities, immunologic responses and increased myocardial apoptosis are factors recognized factors that play a significant role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic DC. Mortality in severe CHF may reach 50% at 2 years after diagnosis. The introduction of \"triple\" therapy combining diuretics, digoxin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) has significantly decreased this high mortality. Recent large, multicentric clinical trials on drugs aimed to diminish the neuroendocrine hyperactivity of patients in stable chronic CHF (betablockers and spirolactone) have resulted in an additional reduction in total mortality of about 35% in relation with control groups. Betablockers, compared to ACEI, also diminish the rate of sudden death prompting their almost mandatory indication in the absence of contraindications. Cardiac transplantation presently offers a survival rate of 66% at 5 years but donor scarcity has stabilized the number of procedures. In patients resuscitated from malignant arrhytmias the implantation of defibrillators offers a better survival than drugs.

Diagnosis is more easily achieved because of greater clinical suspicion and more refined screening tools. However, the medical and interventional management of patients with ARAD is not well defined in the literature because there have been few randomized trials. Because the use of angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, and more recently angiotensin-antagonists, has become much more widespread, it is inevitable that we should, knowingly or not, give these drugs to patients with ARAD. We describe 2 case studies in which the angiotensin-antagonist irbesartan was given to 2 patients with effectively single-functional kidneys after successful renal arterial radiologic intervention. The rationale for the use of irbesartan was to control BP, which had not responded to the initial arterial intervention, and took place in patients both refractory to, and intolerant of, many other anti-hypertensive drugs. Irbesartan successfully and safely reduced systemic BP, measured by use of ambulatory BP, without prejudicing renal function (measured by use of individual kidney function GFR).",

Although the morphology of these has been well described, the molecular events are not fully understood. This review summarizes the evidence from transgenic animals for a role for the activation of a local paracrine renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of malignant vascular injury.

Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor-mediated uptake of circulating (125)I-Ang II was increased at 1 and 3 weeks in noninfarcted LV, and this uptake was the main cause of the transient elevation in Ang II levels in the noninfarcted LV at 1 week. Ang II levels and AT(1) receptor-mediated uptake of circulating Ang II were reduced in the infarct area at all time points. Coronary Ang I to Ang II conversion was unaffected by MI. Captopril and the AT(1) receptor antagonist eprosartan attenuated postinfarct remodeling, although both drugs increased cardiac Ang II production. Captopril blocked coronary conversion by >80% and normalized Ang II uptake in the noninfarcted LV. Eprosartan did not affect coronary conversion and blocked cardiac Ang II uptake by >90%.", 
    "76": "Both circulating and locally generated Ang II contribute to remodeling after MI. The rise in tissue Ang II production during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and AT(1) receptor blockade suggests that the antihypertrophic effects of these drugs result not only from diminished AT(1) receptor stimulation but also from increased stimulation of growth-inhibitory Ang II type 2 receptors.",

The results showed that intravenous injection of bacterial endotoxin produced a fever in dehydrated rats (rats deprived of water for 24 h) that was significantly greater than that seen in normally hydrated rats. In contrast, dehydration had no effect on the fever induced by intravenous interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Under dehydrated conditions, the enhanced endotoxin-induced fever was significantly inhibited by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril, but the IL-1beta fever was not. These results suggest that the dehydration-induced enhancement of endotoxin fever is due, at least in part, to the action of ANG II, which elicits an increased production of pyrogenic cytokines such as IL-1.",

Membrane fluidity was determined using fluorescent labels spectroscopy; membrane potential was evaluated by means of potential-sensitive fluorescent dyes; and acetylcholinesterase activity was estimated using the Ellman method. Both perindoprilat and laser irradiation, when used separately, increase microviscosity in the polar region and hyperpolarize the membranes in comparison with control erythrocytes. The combined action of these agents does not cause any further change in these parameters. Perindoprilat has an additional inhibitory effect on the activity of acetylcholinesterase, whereas laser irradiation causes an increase in the activity of the enzyme. Their combined action restores the initial activity of the enzyme independently of the sequence of treatment with both agents.",

Arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) showed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.232). Combination therapy with hydrocortisone, glucose-insulin therapy (GIT) and NaHCO3 successfully rescued this patient. The patient 2 (28 years of age) was admitted to our hospital because of congestive heart failure. Laboratory findings were as follows; Na 129 mEq/L, K 5.5 mEq/L, BUN 60 mg/dl, cortisol 21 micrograms/dl, renin 36 ng/ml/hr and aldosterone 47 ng/dl. He complained abdominal discomforts from the next day of admission. Ten days after the admission Na, K and BUN were 111 mEq/L, 6.2 mEq/L and 154 mg/dl, respectively. ABG showed compensated metabolic acidosis. He fell into shock during GIT therapy. Laboratory findings at that time were as follows; Na 108 mEq/L, K 3.2 mEq/L, ACTH 77.6 pg/ml, cortisol 24 micrograms/dl, renin 58 ng/ml/hr and aldosterone 24 ng/dl. Although hydrocortisone was introduced, he could not recover and died. There are some reports about life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic acidosis in the patients receiving ACEI. These phenomena were more frequent in patients with renal dysfunction and/or congestive heart failure. Hyponatremia, hypovolemia, combination therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and/or potassium sparing diuretics were reported as risk factors. We could not prove the correlation between the acute changes in our cases and ACEI. However ACEI is suspicious, because many of these risk factors were observed in our cases. Aldosterone was extremely elevated in the patient 1 when potassium was severely elevated. On the other hand, the patient 2 showed lower aldosterone level after correction of potassium than that on admission. Potassium is regarded as a major secretion factor of aldosterone for patients receiving ACEI. The fact the patient 2 fell into shock during GIT, tells us that we should use steroid simultaneously when we try to correct potassium quickly in severe cases, because acute reduction of potassium may decrease aldosterone. Today, ACEI is a common drug for CHF, so we should pay attentions that ACEI could cause such acute changes. To prevent such acute changes, excessive restriction of water and sodium intake should be avoided. If possible, NSAID and potassium sparing diuretics also should be avoided. Steroid therapy must be introduced rapidly when needed.",

In stratified models, the receipt of an ACE inhibitor was associated with a 37% (16%-52%) lower mortality for patients who had poor renal function (serum creatinine level,<265 micromol/L [<3 mg/dL]) and a 16% (8%-23%) lower mortality for patients who had better renal function.

    "89": "Insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the ACE gene has been reported to be involved in various cardiovascular diseases. We investigated prospectively whether the response to the ACE inhibitor fosinopril varied according to the ACE genotype in previously untreated Greek hypertensive patients. After a 4-week observation period, fosinopril was administered at a dose of 20 mg daily and blood pressure was measured weekly for 6 months. The study population consisted of 104 hypertensive patients (46 male, 58 female). There were no differences in age, gender, body mass index, and pretreatment blood pressure levels among patients with the DD, ID, and II genotypes (n= 42, 30, 32, respectively). The reduction in systolic blood pressure was significantly greater in patients carrying the DD compared to II or ID genotypes (5.6 +/- 3.1 vs. 3.1 +/- 1.1 or 3.6 +/- 2.2, respectively; ANOVA, p < 0.05). The reduction in diastolic blood pressure was also significantly greater in DD hypertensives compared with II or ID (8.9 +/- 6 vs. 5.5 +/- 3.4 or 5.8 +/- 4, respectively; ANOVA, p < 0.05). The age and BMI were not correlated with the changes in SBP or DBP that were observed after fosinopril administration. In conclusion, the ACE gene genotype was shown to influence the response to fosinopril in hypertensive patients.",

In recent years substantial discoveries have been made regarding the pathophysiology of heart failure, particularly in the area of neurohormonal activation. New interest in therapy with aldosterone antagonists was stimulated by results of a 2-year study of 1663 patients with heart failure that showed a 30% relative risk reduction of death among patients given a subhemodynamic dosage of spironolactone, a nonselective aldosterone antagonist, compared with placebo, in addition to standard therapy of diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and digitalis.", 
    "91": "In every year since 1984, cardiovascular disease has claimed the lives of more women than men. Data from randomized trials indicate that gender contributes to increased mortality after myocardial infarction independent of other risk factors, but additional confounding variables cannot be discounted. Data from registry databases indicate that women are less likely to receive medically proven therapies for myocardial infarction. Women experience more vague symptoms, which may account for underuse of effective therapies. In addition, they may benefit less from thrombolytic therapy than men. Increased use of thrombolytic therapy has resulted in a continued decrease in cardiovascular deaths for men, but not for women. It is unclear if this disparity is a result of inequitable access to therapy or decreased efficacy of these agents in women.", 
    "92": "Fifteen patients of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome who failed to respond to 8 weeks of corticosteroid therapy formed the material for this study. There were 10 males and 5 females, age ranging from 4 to 56 years. Three patients had hypertension. Histological lesions were focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 8; membranous glomerulonephritis in 3; mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in 2 and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 2 patients. Proteinuria ranged from 3.64 to 8.66 g/1.73 m2/day. Serum albumin ranged between 2.2 to 3.3 g/dl. Serum creatinine was elevated > 1.5 mg/dl in 3 cases. After discontinuing steroids, enalapril was started in a dose of 2.5 mg/day and increased by 2.5 mg/day every 3-4 days till the maximum tolerated dose but not exceeding 20 mg/day. Proteinuria, serum albumin and serum creatinine estimations were done every 4 weeks for six months and every three months thereafter. Patients were followed up for 6 to 30 months. Proteinuria decreased to < 1.5 g/1.73 m2/day in 12 patients (80%) and to < 0.5 g/1.73 m2/day in 10 patients (66.7%) by 8 weeks. There was no significant decrease in proteinuria in 3 (20%) patients; two of these were cases of FSGS and one of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Oedema, hypoalbuminaemia and hypercholesterolaemia returned to normal in all patients who had a decrease in the proteinuria. There was no correlation between the histological lesion and response to enalapril. There was no rise in the serum creatinine level above the baseline in any of the patients. Except for cough in one patient, no other significant side effects were observed. We conclude that enalapril is effective in reducing proteinuria and thereby the morbidity in steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome irrespective of the underlying pathology.", 
    "93": "Previous reports have clarified that focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis(FSGS) appearing in membranous nephropathy(MN) is associated with a poorer prognosis than that of MN without FSGS. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of such FSGS lesions may show substantial individual differences. In some patients, hemodynamic alterations secondary to hypertension and vascular disorders seem to play a crucial role in the development of such FSGS lesions. In such instances, steady regulation of blood pressure might slow down further progression of FSGS lesions. Here we describe two cases of biopsy-proven MN with FSGS. Case I was a 44-year-old man who had shown massive proteinuria with hematuria at the age of 39 years. Renal biopsy specimens obtained at the age of 40 and 41 years showed MN without FSGS and MN with FSGS, respectively. His blood pressure control was fairly good throughout the course. Although he was on a steroid, an immunosuppressant, a low protein diet, and an ACE inhibitor, his renal function declined in 5 years. Case 2 was a 61-year-old woman who showed nephrotic syndrome at the age of 39 years. A renal biopsy specimen obtained at the age of 58 years showed MN with FSGS and remarkable atherosclerotic changes of the interlobular arteries. Her blood pressure control was rather poor throughout the course. Her renal function gradually declined over 22 years. Since parts of the FSGS lesions of the second case may have been caused by hypertension, it is tempting to speculate that day-to-day control of blood pressure could improve the long-term prognosis. We believe that, at least in some patients of MN with FSGS, careful management may lead to a more favorable course of decline in renal function.", 
    "94": "Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT/MRP2) is known to play a major role in the transport of anionic xenobiotics including many types of glucuronide and glutathione conjugates across the bile canalicular membrane. In the present study, the biliary excretion of telmisartan (BIBR 277) and its glucuronide was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats (SDRs) and also in mutant strain Eisai-hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR), which have a hereditary defect in cMOAT/MRP2. Only a minimal difference was observed in the time profile of the plasma concentration of total radioactivity after administration of an i.v. bolus of BIBR 277. About 45% of the administered dose was excreted into bile up to 240 min in both strains, most of the radioactivity in the bile being BIBR 277 glucuronide. No significant difference was observed in the biliary excretion of BIBR 277 and its glucuronide between SDRs and EHBR although the plasma disappearance of BIBR 277 glucuronide was delayed in EHBR. To explain these data, the extent of glucuronidation of BIBR 277 by liver microsomes was examined in both strains. The V(max) value for the formation of BIBR 277 glucuronide was 2 to 3 times higher in EHBR than in SDRs, whereas both strains had similar K(m) values. After an i.v. bolus administration of BIBR 277 glucuronide, its plasma disappearance was delayed in EHBR, the biliary clearance in EHBR being about half that in SDRs. These results suggest that BIBR 277 glucuronide is transported by both cMOAT/MRP2 and another transporter that is also expressed in EHBR, and that the BIBR 277 glucuronidation is enhanced in EHBR, resulting in comparable excretion of glucuronide in both strains.", 
    "95": "Experimental and clinical research supports a direct link between activation of the renin-angiotensin system and production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the primary physiologic inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator. Several studies have reported higher PAI-1 levels in individuals carrying the deletion (D) allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene. We investigated the association between ACE genotypes and plasma PAI-1 levels in a family study of 577 women and 428 men from four US communities. Participants were between 25 and 84 years of age without evidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Mean geometric plasma PAI-1 levels adjusted for ethnicity were 17.4, 17.9, and 18.1 ng/ml in participants with the DD, insertion-deletion (ID), and II genotypes, respectively (P = 0.89 for difference). We found no associations between ACE I/D genotypes and plasma PAI-1 antigen concentrations in a subset of participants without major CHD risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, overweight, smoking, diabetes) or in a small sample of African-Americans. Our findings suggest that the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism has relatively little, if any, influence on circulating PAI-1 levels in the population at large.", 
    "96": "Cross talk between angiotensin AT1 and alpha1-adrenergic receptors has been reported previously and points to the existence of physiologic regulation between the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system at the receptor level. This regulation may play an important role in the control of blood pressure and may be modified in different cardiovascular pathologies. Nevertheless, neither the physiologic actions nor the clinical relevance of the interaction between these 2 receptors has yet been established. To reveal these aspects in relation to heart failure, the interaction between vascular AT1 and alpha1-adrenergic receptors was evaluated in the Syrian cardiomyopathic hamster model.", 
    "97": "The vascular response of each individual receptor to vasoactive agonist was assessed in the presence and absence of antagonists of the other receptor using aortic rings from 11-month-old Syrian cardiomyopathic hamsters. Age-matched golden hamsters were used as controls. In control hamsters, concentration-response curves for the norepinephrine (NE)-induced contraction were significantly displaced to the left after 100 mmol/L losartan incubation. The maximal tension achieved (Emax) values increased by 26+/-4.3% after incubation (P < .05). Similar results were obtained when 20 micromol/L enalapril was used to block angiotensin II (Ang II) synthesis. NE concentration-response curves were also displaced to the left and Emax increased by 27%+/-8.0% (P < .05). The concentrations that induce 50% of the maximal contraction (EC50) were 22.2+/-0.2 nmol/L for untreated and 27.1+/-2.0 nmol/L for losartan-treated aortic rings (n = 8, P > .05). However, EC50 values were significantly reduced in aortic rings treated with enalapril (7.51+/-0.16 nmol/L, n = 8, P < .05). Blockade of alpha1 receptor with 10 micromol/L prazosin increased the response to Ang II by 32% (n = 6, P < .05). In contrast, when these experiments were repeated in aortic rings from cardiomyopathic animals, no interaction between the 2 receptors was observed. NE concentration-response curves, Emax (9.6%+/-2.8% increase after enalapril. and 5.8%+/-6.5% increase after losartan, P > .05) and EC50 values (14.7+/-0.7 nmol/L without treatment, 17.5+/-1.5 nmol/L with enalapril and 11.1+/-0.8 with losartan, n = 8, P > .05) were similar. Furthermore, in cardiomyopathic animals, prazosin did not modify the vascular response to Ang II.", 
    "98": "An interaction exists between vascular AT1 and alpha1-adrenergic receptors in control hamsters but not in cardiomyopathic animals. This interaction seems to be bidirectional and counterregulatory. The lack of this regulation may promote a state of enhanced vascular wall activity, which could contribute to the increased vasoconstriction and total peripheral resistance characteristic of heart failure.", 
    "99": "Considerable evidence suggests that the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs) can attenuate progressive glomerulosclerosis in disease models and can slow disease progression in humans. Because agents that interfere with Ang II action may decrease glomerular injury without altering glomerular pressures, it has been suggested that Ang II has direct effects on glomerular cells to induce sclerosis independent of its hemodynamic actions. To study nonhemodynamic effects of Ang II on matrix metabolism, many investigators have used cell culture systems. Glucose and Ang II have been shown to produce similar effects on renal cells in culture. For instance, incubation of mesangial cells in high-glucose media or in the presence of Ang II stimulates matrix protein synthesis and inhibits degradative enzyme (e.g., collagenase, plasmin) activity. Glucose and Ang II also can inhibit proximal tubule proteinases. Glucose increases expression of the angiotensinogen gene in proximal tubule cells and Ang II production in primary mesangial cell culture, which indicates that high glucose itself can activate the renin-angiotensin system. The effects of glucose and Ang II on mesangial matrix metabolism may be mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Exposure of mesangial cells to glucose or Ang II increases TGF-beta expression and secretion. Their effects on matrix metabolism can be blocked by anti-TGF-beta antibody or ARBs such as losartan, which also prevents the glucose-induced increment in TGF-beta secretion. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that the high-glucose milieu of diabetes increases Ang II production by renal, and especially, mesangial cells, which results in stimulation of TGF-beta secretion, leading to increased synthesis and decreased degradation of matrix proteins, thus producing matrix accumulation. This may be an important mechanism linking hyperglycemia and Ang II in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "100": "Cell cycle regulation in diabetic nephropathy. Renal hypertrophy is one of the earliest abnormalities of diabetic nephropathy. Although selected cell populations. such as tubulointerstitial fibroblasts, may undergo sustained proliferation in the diabetic environment, most renal cells such as mesangial cells are arrested in the G1-phase of the cell cycle after actively leaving G0-phase and some self-limited early proliferation. High glucose, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), angiotensin II, and probably other factors induce inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) including p21Cip1 and p27KiP1. These CDK-inhibitors bind to and inactivate G1-phase cyclin/CDK complexes. The consequence is a lack in kinase activity, underphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene protein, and a failure to initiate the G1-S-phase transit. The half-life of CDK-inhibitors may also be increased by serine phosphorylation mediated through activated MAP kinases. Treatment of diabetic rats with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors attenuates glomerular hypertrophy and abolishes the glomerular expression of the CDK-inhibitors p16INK4 and p27KiP1, thus indicating that the cell cycle arrest can be therapeutically influenced. Cell cycle proteins may also be involved in these molecular events, leading to a limited degree of tubular apoptosis, which is a feature of diabetic nephropathy. Although not definitively proven, accumulating evidence suggests that early hypertrophy of renal cells may act as pacemaker for subsequent irreversible structural changes, such as glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Therefore, a better understanding of altered processes of cell cycle regulation is necessary to develop novel therapeutic strategies to prevent diabetic nephropathy. The recent observation that glomerular hypertrophy and proteinuria do not develop in diabetic p21CiP1 knockout mice indicates that this approach is feasible.", 
    "101": "Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin AT(1) receptor blockers has been shown to delay progression in a variety of renal diseases, suggesting that the RAS, and its major effector molecule, angiotensin II, are important players in renal pathophysiology. Both antagonists combine inhibition of deleterious effects of angiotensin II with activation of potentially beneficial pathways mediated by nitric oxide and prostaglandins. Some concerns have been raised about the completeness of the RAS blockade achieved by these agents. ACE-independent pathways can generate angiotensin II, whereas increases in angiotensin II levels may compete with the AT(1) receptor blocker at the receptor site. It has been suggested that an ACE inhibitor/AT(1) receptor blocker combination offers a better therapeutic effect than treatment with either agent alone. In this review, we focus on mechanisms of actions of ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor blockers, implicate them in the rationale for the use of an ACE inhibitor/AT(1) receptor blocker combination, and discuss evidence evaluating the renal effects of the combination as compared to the effects of a single agent. There is a surprising lack of information about the nephroprotective potential of the combination, allowing no consistent conclusions about the superiority of the combination over the single agent. Several experimental and clinical reports suggest that in some conditions, the combination may be beneficial. Rather than providing unequivocal evidence for the use of combination treatment in the renal disease, these studies should be considered as stimuli for more detailed exploration of this issue.", 
    "102": "When a large multicenter research trial is abruptly terminated, it is usually a consequence of significant adverse events. In contrast, when the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) mortality trial was discontinued 18 months early, it was because of the prominent salutary effect of spironolactone, added to standard multidrug therapy consisting of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and loop diuretic (with or without digoxin), in reducing the incidence of death and hospitalization in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Therapies directed toward suppression of neurohormonal activation have contributed to significant reductions in morbidity and mortality. ACE inhibitors, in particular, have had the largest impact on adverse outcome measures in CHF. Yet despite combined therapy with an ACE inhibitor and loop diuretic, patients on these agents still have an unacceptably high incidence of progressive ventricular failure and death. In the years that followed its discovery in 1954, aldosterone was considered a target for therapy in CHF because of its role in sodium retention. It is now clear that chronic elevations in plasma aldosterone are responsible for many other adverse effects (Fig. 1), including enhanced potassium and magnesium excretion, myocardial fibrosis, inhibition of catecholamine reuptake, endothelial cell and baroreceptor dysfunction, and ventricular arrhythmias. Blockade of aldosterone action is a desirable pharmacologic approach to treating both the underlying pathophysiology of CHF and its clinical consequences. Spironolactone promotes magnesium and potassium retention, increases uptake of myocardial norepinephrine, attenuates formation of myocardial fibrosis, and decreases mortality associated with both progressive ventricular dysfunction and malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Despite the encouraging results seen in the recent RALES mortality trial, a diagnosis of CHF still carries 30% to 40% mortality at 2 years. We need to continue the trend of evaluating newer therapies directed at the pathophysiologic mechanisms of this syndrome, with a goal toward delaying and eventually reversing long-term consequences.", 
    "103": "Systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension, especially in individuals aged 60 years or older. Systolic hypertension is a reflection of decreasing compliance of large arteries and is a strong independent risk factor for all cardiovascular diseases. Despite proven benefits of therapy for systolic hypertension, only 25% of patients with this condition are adequately treated to attain target blood pressures. The sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of high blood pressure (JNC VI) recommends the use of diuretics and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension. Therapy is also guided by comorbid conditions where certain drugs may have additional benefits. The goal of therapy should be a graded reduction in blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg with lower blood pressure targets in patients with coexistent diabetes or renal failure.",

Induction of diabetes resulted in an increase of MDA concentration and progressive decreases of SOD and catalase activities after 6 and 12 weeks. CAP and ENA administration did not affect body weight changes or blood glucose and HbA1c contents in diabetic rats but decreased albuminuria and kidney weight increase, attenuated lipid peroxidation, and prevented the decreases in SOD and catalase activities. These results confirm the oxidative stress in streptozotocin-induced experimental diabetes and point to the beneficial antioxidant effects of angiotensin convertase inhibitors.",

With ageing, alpha-MHC declined and beta-MHC increased giving the increased ratio of beta to alpha-MHC transcripts reported by other investigators. Treatment of SHR led to a significant decline in skeletal actin transcripts (P< 0.01) and reversed the rise in beta-MHC expression that occurred with ageing (P< 0.01).",

The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, but not the Ang II type 1 receptor blocker losartan, significantly attenuated the effect of PD on blood pressure. PD did not increase the plasma level of catecholamines. The PD-dependent blood pressure increase was not observed in normotensive control rats. Aortic ring assays revealed that functional activation of the AT2 receptor occurs only in the hypertensive rats, and this AT2 response is abolished by indomethacin (5 micromol/l) but not by Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 Fmol/l).",

In these groups of patients, we have tried to make the standard captopril renogram more objective by simultaneously estimating the individual kidney glomerular filtration rate (IKGFR). Twenty-five patients (10 bilateral, 15 unilateral) with angiographically proven renal artery stenosis (RAS) were studied. Ten renal units in five hypertensive patients with normal renal arteries were used as controls. A fall of more than 10% in IKGFR post-captopril was considered a positive result. The sensitivities of renogram and IKGFR in patients with bilateral RAS were 52.9% and 88.2% respectively. In patients with unilateral RAS, the sensitivities of renogram and IKGFR were 30% and 80% respectively. A significant fall in IKGFR was noted in eight of the 15 'normal' renal units of the unilateral RAS group. In conclusion, individual kidney GFR estimation in combination with captopril renography improved significantly the sensitivity in patients with symmetrical bilateral RAS and unilateral RAS with a small, poorly functioning kidney. A fall in GFR in the normal counterpart of a unilateral RAS kidney may be indicative of ongoing damage in the non-involved kidney.",

Whether this holds true for patients with hypertensive heart disease was addressed in this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial.", 
    "120": "A total of 35 patients with primary hypertension, LVH, and LV diastolic dysfunction were treated with either lisinopril (n=18) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; n=17). At baseline and after 6 months, LV catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy, Doppler echocardiography with measurements of LV peak flow velocities during early filling and atrial contraction and isovolumic relaxation time, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring were performed. Myocardial fibrosis was measured by LV collagen volume fraction and myocardial hydroxyproline concentration. With lisinopril, collagen volume fraction decreased from 6.9+/-0.6% to 6. 3+/-0.6% (P:<0.05 versus HCTZ) and myocardial hydroxyproline concentration from 9.9+/-0.3 to 8.3+/-0.4 microg/mg of LV dry weight (P:<0.00001 versus HCTZ); this was associated with an increase in the early filling and atrial contraction LV peak flow velocity ratio from 0.72+/-0.04 to 0.91+/-0.06 (P:<0.05 versus HCTZ) and a decrease in isovolumic relaxation time from 123+/-9 to 81+/-5 ms (P:<0.00002 versus HCTZ). Normalized blood pressure did not significantly change in either group. No LVH regression occurred in lisinopril-treated patients, whereas with HCTZ, myocyte diameter was reduced from 22. 1+/-0.6 to 20.7+/-0.7 microm (P:<0.01 versus lisinopril).",

    "122": "Renin angiotensin system contributes to activation of circulating endothelin in congestive heart failure. To investigate the effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonist and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on the levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), we administered orally angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist, L-158,809 (ATA) (6, 1.2 and 0.12 mg/kg/day), enalapril (1 mg/kg/day) and captopril (7.5 mg/kg/day) for 14 days to mice with viral myocarditis, beginning 7 days after encephalomyocarditis virus (500 pfu/mouse) inoculation. Plasma ET-1, cardiac ET-1, heart weight (HW) and HW/ body weight (BW) ratio were examined and compared with infected untreated mice. Moreover, the HW (mg) and HW/BW (x 10(-3)) ratio were significantly (P<0.05) reduced in mice treated with ATA and ACEIs in comparison with infected control. ACEIs and higher dosed of ATA reduced myofiber hypertrophy. Both of plasma and cardiac ET-1 proteins were significantly elevated in infected control compared with uninfected normal mice. Plasma ET-1 was significantly (P<0.01) reduced in mice with three different concentrations of ATA but were not decreased in mice with captopril or enalapril compared with infected control. The expression of endothelin-1 mRNA was significantly reduced in mice with ATA in comparison with infected untreated mice by competitive RT-PCR. ATA reduced ET-1 protein and mRNA in the myocardium of mice with myocarditis, improving congestive heart failure and myofiber hypertrophy. We suggest the effect of ATA on the reduction of endothelin has a different pathway from angiotensin converting inhibitor and that ATA seems to be a useful agents for congestive heart failure due to viral myocarditis.", 
    "123": "Bradykinin (BK) is a potent hepato-portal hypertensive agent although it is efficiently inactivated by the liver. The organ converts angiotensin I to AII, but at a much slower rate than it inactivates BK. We had previously identified EC 3.4.24.15 as an hepatic bradykinin inactivating endopeptidase that hydrolyzes BK at the F5-F6 bond. The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of BIE, as compared to other kininases, in normal, cirrhotic or inflamed rat livers, as well as in samples of human liver. Using specific substrates and inhibitors we showed that: 1) purified BIE preparation hydrolyzed BK and a BK analogue (BK-Q) with similar efficacy; BK-Q was functionally active since it caused an increase in hepato-portal pressure, as did BK itself. 2) BK degradation in rat serum was performed by ACE since BIE and prolylendopeptidase (PEP) activities were negligible. 3) normal rat liver homogenate contained a large amount of BIE activity which was eliminated by a specific EC 3.4.24.15 inhibitor; ACE and PEP activities were negligible. 4) There was no difference (p>0.05) in BIE activity in the liver homogenates from rats with normal, inflamed or cirrhotic livers. 5) BIE activity was efficiently removed from livers (normal, inflamed or cirrhotic) that were perfused with TritonX-100.6) Human liver had an similar enzymatic pattern although ACE activity was detected. We concluded that in normal, inflamed or cirrhotic rat livers, as well as in the human liver, the bradykinin inactivating endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15), and not ACE, is the major hepatic kininase.", 
    "124": "Sympathetic activation plays an important role in the progression of heart failure, and beta-blocker treatment not only improves ventricular function but may also slow and reverse heart remodeling. Patients with severe heart failure remain markedly symptomatic and have a poor prognosis despite optimal pharmacological treatment which includes an ACE-inhibitor. In these patients the tolerability of beta-blockers is reduced, but they could have the most to gain from this therapy, since they are more likely to show symptomatic and survival improvement in the long term. With close clinical observation during the initiation and titration of the drug, and an adequate adjustment of associated therapy, beta-blockers are tolerated in the majority of such patients. This article reviews the clinical experience of beta-blocker use in advanced heart failure, and discusses the appropriate modality of drug initiation and titration. Considerations are also made about the usefulness of prognostic parameters in the evaluation of tolerability and efficacy of beta-blocker treatment.", 
    "125": "Although inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) have improved the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF), mortality related to this disorder remains unacceptably high. Results from studies started more than 25 years ago in Sweden suggested that long-term therapy with beta-blockers could improve hemodynamics and increase survival in patients with CHF; this hypothesis is confirmed by the results of six double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (MDC, CIBIS, ANZ, US Carvedilol Study, CIBIS II and MERIT-HF) who enrolled about 9000 patients with CHF. In these trials beta-blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol or carvedilol) where added to the stable usual treatment of each patient (ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, digoxin). Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled into the beta-blocker or placebo arm were similar in all these studies. Specifically the mean patient's age was < 60 years, with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-26%, 30% of enrolled patients were in NYHA functional class II and 60% in NYHA functional class III, CHF was due to ischemic heart disease in about 60% of patients. The average follow-up for all the trials was 14.5 +/- 5.6 months. On the whole in patients on beta-blocker treatment there is a 33.3% reduction in total mortality rate, a 34.2% reduction in cardiac death rate, a 37.7% reduction in sudden death rate, and a 41.7% reduction in worsening heart failure mortality rate. Moreover, in beta-blocker patients there is a 31.7% reduction in all-cause readmissions to hospital and a 26% reduction in the combined end point (total mortality and hospital readmission). Beta-blockers improved ventricular function but there was no significant improvement in functional capacity. In conclusion, the results of the six trials considered indicate that there is convincing evidence supporting a favorable effect of beta-blockade on the risk of death and readmission to hospital in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction, aged < 70 years, in NYHA functional class II-III. The effects of these drugs in CHF patients a) with normal left ventricular ejection fraction, b) aged > 65-70 years, c) in NYHA functional class IV, and d) with comorbilities such as obstructive lung disease, diabetes, peripheral arterial diseases, require additional study.",

Medical progress with application of conservative, surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases, but markedly increased the medical care costs. The result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine. This article reviews several recently published clinical trials and discusses, which patient with symptomatic coronary artery disease should undergo a conservative strategy, percutaneous or surgical revascularization.", 
    "127": "The economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant. Approximately 1 to 2% of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure. A great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long-term complications and productivity losses. In order to manage these costs, providers and policymakers increasingly have to focus on economically attractive interventions. Pharmacoeconomic analyses aid the systematic selection of cost-effective drug therapy in congestive heart failure in an era of increasing cost-containment.", 
    "128": "1. NO synthase (NOS)inhibitors partially block bradykinin (BK)-mediated vasorelaxation. Here we investigated whether this is due to incomplete NOS inhibition and/or NO release from storage sites. We also studied the mechanism behind ACE inhibitor-mediated BK potentiation. 2. Porcine coronary arteries (PCAs) were mounted in organ baths, preconstricted, and exposed to BK or the ACE-resistant BK analogue Hyp(3)-Tyr(Me)(8)-BK (HT-BK) with or without the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (100 microM), the NO scavenger hydroxocobalamin (200 microM), the Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-channel blockers charybdotoxin+apamin (both 100 nM), or the ACE inhibitor quinaprilat (10 microM). 3. BK and HT-BK dose-dependently relaxed preconstricted vessels (pEC(50) 8.0+/-0.1 and 8.5+/-0.2, respectively). pEC(50)'s were approximately 10 fold higher with quinaprilat, and approximately 10 fold lower with L-NAME or charybdotoxin+apamin. Complete blockade was obtained with hydroxocobalamin or L-NAME+ charybdotoxin+apamin. 4. Repeated exposure to 100 nM BK or HT-BK, to deplete NO storage sites, produced progressively smaller vasorelaxant responses. With L-NAME, the decrease in response occurred much more rapidly. L-Arginine (10 mM) reversed the effect of L-NAME. 5. Adding quinaprilat to the bath following repeated exposure (with or without L-NAME), at the time BK and HT-BK no longer induced relaxation, fully restored vasorelaxation, while quinaprilat alone had no effect. Quinaprilat also relaxed vessels that, due to pretreatment with hydroxocobalamin or L-NAME+charybdotoxin+apamin, previously had not responded to BK. 6. In conclusion, L-NAME-resistant BK-induced relaxation in PCAs depends on NO from storage sites, and is mediated via stimulation of guanylyl cyclase and/or Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-channels. ACE inhibitors potentiate BK independent of their effect on BK metabolism.", 
    "129": "Long-acting calcium antagonists have been shown to be safe and effective in lowering blood pressure, both as first-line agents and in combination with other classes of antihypertensive drug. They have also been shown to reduce the incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events in elderly patients with predominantly systolic hypertension. It is clear that reduced morbidity and mortality in hypertension is related to the degree to which blood pressure is reduced, regardless of the therapy used. This is the single most important conclusion of all recent trials, especially in the sub-group of hypertensive patients with diabetes. The World Health Organization-International Society of Hypertension guidelines acknowledge this and do not make specific recommendations as to initial therapy in the absence of other medical factors. However the use of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers has strong support from large placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension. The British Hypertension Society and JNC VI guidelines restrict their recommendations for the use of calcium antagonists to isolated systolic hypertension and angina, or when other agents have failed, are contraindicated or are not tolerated. However, their efficacy in lowering blood pressure, their tolerability and potentially beneficial secondary effect on proteinuria, especially in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, still make them attractive antihypertensive agents. The results of further long-term outcome trials that make direct comparisons between calcium antagonists and other classes of antihypertensive drug are still awaited. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the antiproteinuric effect of calcium antagonists, even that of the non-dihydropyridine type, seems to depend on an adequate and stable reduction in blood pressure.", 
    "130": "The reaction of CoCl2 with 1-(D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropionyl)-L-proline (L or captopril) yields a new nanocrystalline complex with general formula [CoL2(OH)]2.

XPS analyses is a valuable tool for studying the chemical composition and the chemical state of elements at the surface of solids whereas WAXS provides information on the short range order. A model is proposed for the binding of the complex and its structure: the Co(III) ion is bonded with a pseudo-octahedral configuration. Captopril molecules are coordinated via mercapto group and amidic C=O group to Co(III) ions: two S atoms are bridging bonded between two Co(III) ions. The OH- ion completes the coordination around the Co(III).",

Obesity was found in 7.4% (245) subjects and morbid obesity concerned 0.4% of the total sample (mean age 37.6 +/- 9.7 [SD] years, 52.4% of males). Risk of obesity was significantly associated with age, male sex, professional classes (higher in blue collars workers, lower in senior executive), business travels, atypical schedules, professional and private difficulties. Albeit the prevalence of drug users (49.7%) was similar whatever the BMI, obese subjects used a higher number of drugs than non obese (2.0 +/- 1.2 versus 1.6 +/- 0.9, p < 0.001). Risk of consumption of cardiovascular drugs was higher in obese than in non obese subjects (OR 2.9, 95% CI [2.2-4.1]). After adjustment on confounding factors, obesity increased specific drug use such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (OR 3.3, 95% CI [1.7-6.4]), beta-blocking agents (OR 2.83, 95% CI [1.01-8.01]), calcium channel blockers (OR 2.44, 95% CI [1.06-5.63]) or diuretics only in women (OR 5.7, 95% CI [2.1-16.3]).

The reduction in carotid pression puls\u00e9e, but not in mean BP, was a major independent determinant of the reduction in carotid IMT.

    "139": "Hypertension is common in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and contributes to the progression of its complications in patients with diabetes. Doxazosin is a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor-blocking anti-hypertensive agent and has a favorable impact upon lipid metabolism. We investigated the effect of doxazosin on the lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size that is associated with many elements of the insulin resistance syndrome. Cross-sectional study (n=19) was designed to determine whether doxazosin, administered with an angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and a Ca antagonist, affects LDL particle size. As a follow-up study (n=6), lipid and glucose metabolism and LDL particle size were followed for 12 weeks before and after the initiation of doxazosin administration (1-4 mg/day). The average size of LDL particle was significantly larger in the patients treated with doxazosin (LDL-migration index (LDL-MI): 0.348+/-0.027) than those in the patient treated without doxazosin (0.378+/-0.035), although LDL cholesterol levels did not differ between the two groups. The plasma glucose and HbA1c levels remained unchanged. Lipid profile showed normolipemia throughout the period of the study. However, LDL particle size was demonstrated to become larger during the following period. Small LDL fraction (LDL3-7) diminished remarkably and large LDL (LDL1-2) increased on the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) LDL system (LipoPrint). From this pilot study, it was concluded that doxazosin is a useful anti-hypertensive agent for hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients in improving the size of LDL particle.", 
    "140": "NSAIDs are known to attenuate the effects of some antihypertensive medications. It is not known whether the new class of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is similarly affected. We conducted a multicenter study assessing the effect of indomethacin on the antihypertensive effects of losartan and captopril. After 4 weeks of placebo washout, hypertensive patients received 6 weeks of active antihypertensive therapy with either 50 mg losartan once daily (n=111) or 25 mg captopril twice daily for 1 week, which was increased to 50 mg twice daily for 5 weeks (n=105). This was followed by 1 week of concomitant therapy with indomethacin (75 mg daily). The primary outcome measure was the change in mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure after the addition of indomethacin. Both captopril and losartan significantly lowered ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (losartan -5.3 mm Hg, P:<0.001; captopril -5.6 mm Hg, P:<0.001) after 6 weeks of therapy. Indomethacin significantly attenuated the 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure for both losartan (2.2 mm Hg, P:<0.05) and captopril (2.7 mm Hg, P:<0.001) and also attenuated the effect of captopril on trough sitting diastolic blood pressure. Changes in daytime diastolic blood pressure (7:00 AM to 11:00 PM) were similar to the 24-hour response in both groups. Nighttime diastolic blood pressure (11:01 PM to 6:59 AM) was significantly attenuated in captopril-treated patients (2.0 mm Hg, P:<0.05), but losartan was unaffected (0.4 mm Hg). Thus, concurrent treatment with indomethacin similarly attenuates the 24-hour antihypertensive response to losartan and captopril.", 
    "141": "We quantified the repolarization time (so-called QT interval) in a rat, an animal species that does not show a well-characterized T wave on surface ECG. We used spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and converting enzyme inhibition to demonstrate a reversible increase in QT interval in pressure-overloaded hearts in the absence of ischemia. An implanted telemetry system recording ECG data in freely moving rats was used to automatically calculate the RR interval. The QT duration was manually determined by use of a calibrated gauge, and a time-frequency domain analysis was used to evaluate heart rate variability. Left ventricular mass was sequentially assessed by echocardiography. Before treatment, 12-month-old SHR had higher left ventricular mass, QT and RR intervals, and unchanged heart rate variability compared with age-matched Wistar rats. A 2-month converting enzyme inhibition treatment with trandolapril reduces systolic blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and QT interval. The RR interval and heart rate variability remains unchanged. There is a positive correlation between the QT interval and left ventricular mass. The SHR is suitable for longitudinal studies on the QT interval. Thus, the detection of the QT interval reflects the phenotypic changes that occur during mechanical overload and, on the basis of these criteria, allows an in vivo determination of the adaptational process.", 
    "142": "Heart transplantation (HT) provides longer survival than that of the natural history in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the optimal timing for cardiac transplantation and predictors of mortality in patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy (ESCM) has been poorly defined. The primary purpose of this study focused on the natural history of ambulatory patients with ESCM for HT assessment. Secondly, we tried to determine prognostic factors of individuals with the poorest short-term outcome and the optimal timing for HT in patients with ESCM. Finally, clinical treatment with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), carvedilol and amiodarone in the prevention of mortality caused by ESCM, were retrospectively evaluated. The short-term outcomes of 119 referral patients with ESCM for four years were observed. The patients had New York Heart Association class III to IV dyspnea at initial assessment for HT. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 17 +/- 6% and cardiac index (CI) was 2.0 +/- 0.6l/min/m2. After optimization of medical treatment, the patients were divided into two major groups according to CI equal to or less than 2.0l/min/m2 and more than 2.0l/min/m2. HTs were accepted in 88 patients and the patients were divided into two groups: medical treatment (group 1, 56 patients) or HT (group 3, 32 patients); HT was not accepted in the other 31 patients (group 2). We studied the probability of the survival curve and prognostic variables of the groups with medical treatment in the follow-up of 12 +/- 9 months. During follow-up, 49 patients were alive without HT. The remaining 38 patients died; 27 patients were in group 1 and 11 patients were in group 2. Eight deaths in group 2 were sudden. The actuarial survival rate among the non-HT population was 73%, 68%, 63 %, and 56 % at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. The actuarial survival rate among group 1 was 70 %, 59 %, 55 %, and 52 % at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. The actuarial survival rate among group 2 was 87 %, 85 %, 77 %, and 65 % at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. A comparison, excluding patients with HT, was performed with those who had survived < 1 year and > or 1 year after assessment, and those who had died. Two parameters were independent predictors of prognosis on univariate and multivariate analysis: total pulmonary vascular resistance (TPR) > or = 14 Wood units (W) and CI < 1.65 l/min/m2 at 6 and 12 months after assessment. Treatment with amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia (VT) showed no convincing role in the prevention of sudden death in our patients. Also, treatment with ACEIs or carvedilol for heart failure was unconvincing to improve the short-term outcome in this study. Our results suggest in properly selected patients that HT should be considered within six months among patients with severe heart failure. Hemodynamic parameters associated with right cardiac function are important determinants of mortality caused by progressive heart failure. Predictors such as CI and TPR may be considered as important markers of mortality in prediction of short-term outcome in patients with ESCM, as other predictors reported in the literature.",

This article features how to diagnose hypertension as well as describes pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options. The properties, proper use, and side effect profile of each of the nine classes of antihypertension drugs commonly used and three classes of medications on the horizon will be described.

    "144": "African Americans outrank other ethnic groups in the United States in prevalence, early onset, and severity of hypertension. Furthermore, African Americans suffer the highest rates of mortality from cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and end-stage renal disease. The recently concluded Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study reports that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in a broad range of patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. These results strengthen the case for increasing the use of ACE inhibitor therapy. In accord with the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) guidelines, antihypertensive monotherapy for African Americans is based on the known ability of diuretics and calcium channel blockers to produce greater reductions in blood pressure in this population than those attainable with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors. The national guidelines also suggest ACE inhibitors for all hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction or nephropathy, which implies that African Americans must cross a clinical threshold to become candidates for these agents. The rationale for delaying ACE inhibitor therapy is due in part to a perceived unique pathobiology in hypertensive African Americans: an excess prevalence of salt sensitivity, hypervolemia, and low plasma renin activity (PRA). At first glance, it would seem intuitive to avoid agents that further depress the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and choose agents that reduce plasma volume. However, most hypertensive African Americans are not hypovolemic. Furthermore, dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy raise PRA and improve the response to ACE inhibitors. The overall aim of this article is to explain the rationale for expanded use of drugs that block the RAS in African Americans and low-renin populations.", 
    "145": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) regulates blood pressure, volume, and electrolyte balance. Derangements of the RAS may contribute to hypertension and renal injury, particularly in patients with types 1 or 2 diabetes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been proven to be beneficial in patients with hypertension and diabetes by preventing or delaying the development and progression of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Comparisons with other drug classes demonstrate renoprotective effects for ACE inhibitors that are independent of-and additive to-their systemic antihypertensive actions. These renal effects may derive from their preferential dilation of renal efferent arterioles, which further reduces intraglomerular pressure. Inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II) synthesis is subtotal, however, because local non-ACE enzymes also convert Ang I to Ang II. The existence of alternative pathways for Ang II generation that are unaffected by ACE inhibitors raises questions about whether ACE is the optimal target for RAS suppression. Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs), which interrupt the RAS at the target-organ receptor level, will block the effect of angiotensin whether its production involved ACE or a non-ACE pathway. ARBs are currently undergoing clinical trials to assess their efficacy in hypertensive patients with nephropathy.", 
    "146": "Diabetes mellitus, a highly prevalent metabolic and vascular disease, affects 155 million people worldwide. Tight blood glucose control can significantly reduce the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, but does not appear to significantly reduce its macrovascular complications. Several randomized clinical trials indicate that tight blood pressure control can reduce the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has proven effective both in lowering blood pressure and in independently slowing the progression of nephropathy. If instituted early, ACE inhibitor therapy potentially may prevent progression to end-stage renal disease in normotensive patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes. Additionally, ACE inhibitors may reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs), which attenuate the deleterious effects of the RAS via blockade of the Ang II subtype 1 receptor, may also be beneficial. Clinical trials are under way to evaluate this possibility.", 
    "147": "Abnormal lipid levels contribute significantly to the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), which is increased further in the presence of other risk factors. The association between elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and CHD risk is well established, and large primary and secondary prevention studies of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have shown conclusively that lowering LDL cholesterol levels reduces CHD events and total mortality. Regardless of the intervention used (diet, surgery, drugs), reduction of plasma cholesterol has consistently produced a reduction in cardiovascular risk. Absolute benefit is greatest in those who are at highest risk initially, and trial results suggest that the lower the LDL cholesterol level achieved, at least down to LDL of 3.0 mmol/l, then the lower is the CHD event risk. Epidemiological data also point to the negative impact of other lipids on CHD risk. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and high levels of triglycerides (particularly in conjunction with an LDL/HDL ratio >5) are particularly strong risk factors for CHD. Thus, although prevention trials to date have primarily assessed the impact of LDL lowering on CHD events, the initial assessment of CHD risk should consider a more detailed atherogenic profile including HDL and triglyceride levels. A general approach to preventing cardiovascular disease should include strategies to reduce the overall CHD risk by lifestyle modification and management of modifiable risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and diabetes. Based on data from recent prevention studies, and because they are the most potent lipid-lowering agents available for lowering LDL cholesterol, statins have appropriately become the drug of choice for most patients with hyperlipidaemia who require drug therapy.", 
    "148": "In the following study we examined the combined effect of chronic alcohol administration and anti-hypertensive drug treatment in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR were fed alcohol for six weeks while taking the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril. After six weeks, protein synthesis rates, contractile protein levels and protease activities were examined in control; alcohol; control+lisinopril; alcohol+lisinopril groups. Lisinopril treatment significantly reduced left ventricular mass, protein content and contractile proteins in control rats, but these effects were not as pronounced in alcohol+lisinopril rats. Protein synthesis rates in both mixed and myofibrillar fractions were not significantly different in any of the 4 groups. The enzyme activities of the proteases cathepsin D and dipeptidyl aminopepetidase I increased in control+lisinopril rats, however, this effect was not evident in alcohol+lisinopril rats. Contractile proteins identified by one-dimensional electrophoresis showed that lisinopril treatment reduced all contractile proteins in control rats. However, in alcohol+ lisinopril rats, myosin heavy chain was higher than in control+lisinopril rats. In summary, alcohol ingestion impairs the regression of the hypertrophic myocardium in SHR on ACE-inhibitor treatment, which was reflected by altered protein metabolism. This study suggests that successful anti-hypertensive treatment may not be achieved if alcohol misuse is evident.", 
    "149": "Prostaglandins play important roles in renal physiology and in the development of renovascular hypertension. In a recent study, inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis was found to be useful for detecting renovascular hypertension using renal scintigraphy. In the current study, the authors evaluated the role of aspirin (an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis) and compared it with Tc-99m DTPA captopril renal scintigraphy (CS).", 
    "150": "Twenty-five patients were examined with Tc-99m DTPA in a three-step manner: a baseline study, CS, and aspirin scintigraphy (AS). Each scintigraphic study was interpreted visually and according to the renogram curve patterns. Semiquantitative parameters (Tmax, renal indices [%], 20-minute/max count ratio, glomerular filtration rate) were also calculated. Plasma renin activity was determined for each study. The blood pressures of all patients were measured during AS. All patients had a contrast-enhanced angiogram that was used as the reference test.", 
    "151": "Three groups of patients were observed based on the scintigraphic and angiographic results. In each group, no difference was observed in blood pressure after aspirin administration. In group 1, seven patients had normal angiographic and scintigraphic results. In group 2, eight patients had angiographically confirmed renal artery stenosis (RAS). In 6 patients (mean, 47% RAS), both AS and CS were negative for RVH. In the remaining two patients with RAS (mean, 83% stenosis), the kidneys were atrophic on the stenotic side, and thus the kidneys did not respond to the interventions. No difference was observed in plasma renin activity in groups 1 and 2. Group 3 included 10 patients who had angiographically confirmed RAS (mean, 86%). In 9 patients, both CS and AS were positive for RVH. In the remaining one patient, scintigraphic results were falsely negative. Statistical analyses performed for semiquantitative parameters did not reveal any significant difference in this group, although there was a tendency toward prolonged Tmax values after captopril and aspirin administration. In four cases, unexpected elevation of plasma renin activity was observed in group 3.", 
    "152": "These data indicate that AS with Tc-99m DTPA is an alternative for CS. It has the advantage of having no effect on blood pressure and does not require that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors be discontinued. Although in this study 9 of 10 patients had correct diagnoses of RAS, further studies, especially using tubular agents with the calculation of parenchymal transit time, might provide valuable information in this patient group. An ongoing study is being performed in the authors' institute.", 
    "153": "Unlike angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), few long-term studies have shown calcium antagonists to retard the progression of renal dysfunction. Our aim was to prospectively compare the effects of amlodipine and ACEI (enalapril) on renal function in hypertensive patients with renal impairment due to chronic glomerulonephritis and essential hypertension. A total of 72 hypertensive patients with serum creatinine (Cr) > 1.5 mg/dL were randomly allocated to treatment with either drug. During a 1-year period, 33% of the patients treated with ACEI dropped out due to adverse events, whereas 9% of patients with amlodipine dropped out. Data of 28 patients were available for analysis of more than 1-year follow-up. Reductions in blood pressure were comparable between the amlodipine (from 165/101 to 138/81 mm Hg) and ACEI groups. Serum Cr increased from 2.1+/-0.8 (SD) to 2.6+/-1.0 mg/dL with amlodipine (n = 16), but the difference was equivalent to that with ACEI (n = 12). Creatinine clearance (Ccr) in the moderate dysfunction group (basal Cr, 1.5 to 2.0 mg/dL) changed from 36+/-10 to 33+/-11 mL/min (not significant) with amlodipine, and the change was similar to that noted with ACEI. Annual declines in Ccr with amlodipine (-3.7 mL/min/year) and ACEI (-2.6 mL/min/year) were comparable, and both tended to be smaller than the annual decline in glomerular filtration rate reported in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (-6 mL/min/year). Serum potassium was increased significantly (P < .01), from 4.5+/-0.4 to 5.3+/-0.8 mEq/L, only in the ACEI group. This 1-year prospective study demonstrated the effect of amlodipine on renal function to be likely the same as that of ACEI. Furthermore, amlodipine was better tolerated than ACEI for hypertensive patients with renal dysfunction.", 
    "154": "Older drivers have elevated crash rates and are more likely to be injured or die if they have a crash. Medical conditions and medications have been hypothesized as determinants of crash involvement. This population-based case-control study sought to identify medical conditions and medications associated with risk of at-fault crashes among older drivers. A total of 901 drivers aged 65 years and older were selected in 1996 from Alabama Department of Public Safety driving records: 244 at-fault drivers involved in crashes; 182 not at-fault drivers involved in crashes; and 475 drivers not involved in crashes were enrolled. Information on demographic factors, chronic medical conditions, medications, driving habits, visual function, and cognitive status was collected. Older drivers with heart disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 2.2) or stroke (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 0.9, 3.9) were more likely to be involved in at-fault automobile crashes. Arthritis was also associated with an increased risk among females (OR =1.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.9). Use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.0, 2.6), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (OR = 1.6, 95 CI: 1.0, 2.7), and anticoagulants (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.0, 73) was associated with an increased risk of at-fault involvement in crashes. Benzodiazepine use (OR = 5.2, 95% CI: 0.9, 30.0) was also associated with an increased risk. Calcium channel blockers (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.9) and vasodilators (OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1, 1.0) were associated with a reduced risk of crash involvement. The identification of medical conditions and medications associated with risk of crashes is important for enhancing the safety and mobility of older drivers.", 
    "155": "Fifty patients with stable slight and moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension, treated by ramipril, atenolol, or isradipine, were examined. Total protein and urinary excretion of individual proteins were studied before and after treatment. Urinary concentrations of apolipoproteins A1 and B1, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, prealbumin, albumin, beta 2-microglobulin, transferrin, haptoglobin, IgG and IgA, and C3 and C4 complement components were measured. Index of proteinuria selectiveness was calculated for each portion of urine. All three drugs exerted a nephroprotective effect, atenolol being the most active of them. Apolipoproteins, IgG, and complement components were the most valuable for diagnosis. Their excretion correlated with the severity of arterial hypertension and efficiency of treatment. Use of protein markers helps reliably assess the renal function and monitor the treatment efficiency.",

    "157": "One thousand patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes were randomly selected from the Iowa Medicaid database and followed retrospectively from 1994 through 1998. Data on medication use (insulin, oral antidiabetic agents, or both) and medical services were collected from prescription claims and diagnostic codes. Differences were evaluated with nonparametric statistics.", 
    "158": "Overall, 402 patients (40.2%) were prescribed an ACE inhibitor during the study period before any adverse renal outcomes occurred; 25 of the patients in this group (6.2%) had a subsequent adverse renal outcome. One hundred patients (16.7%) not receiving an ACE inhibitor had an adverse renal outcome (p = 0.006). We evaluated four subgroups and found that patients with hypertension had fewer adverse renal outcomes if they were receiving ACE inhibitors whether they were taking (p = 0.0006) or not taking insulin (p = 0.047). There was no difference in adverse renal outcomes and ACE inhibitor use in normotensive patients who were taking (p = 0.15) or not taking insulin (p = 0.96). The pattern of use of ACE inhibitors in this population increased more than twofold between 1994 and 1998 (38.1% vs. 80.1%; p < 0.001). Of those patients who had adverse renal outcomes, almost one-half (43.2%) were not taking an ACE inhibitor in 1998.", 
    "159": "ACE inhibitors were renoprotective in patients with diabetes in the Iowa Medicaid population. All patients with diabetes who had hypertension had fewer renal outcomes when taking an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors were used more frequently in 1998 than in 1994. The use of ACE inhibitors in this population is improving, but remains less than optimal.", 
    "160": "The prevention of coronary heart disease remains one of the greatest challenges for antihypertensive therapy. Previous trials have identified a shortfall in the protection of hypertensive patients against coronary heart disease compared with that predicted from observational studies. The present question is whether newer classes of drugs or drug combinations (calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) can redress the shortfall compared with older agents (diuretics, beta-blockers). However, to answer this question only two trials (Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial [ALLHAT] and Anglo Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial [ASCOT]) are of sufficient size to be adequately powered to address this issue. ALLHAT and ASCOT have completed randomization of patients and will report on morbidity and mortality within 3 to 4 years.", 
    "161": "Two independent pharmacologic methods of specifically interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have been brought to the marketplace: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). These agents have the potential not only to be very widely used for a broad variety of clinical indications but also to compete against each other as treatments for hypertension, heart failure, renal impairment, and other conditions. Many short-term comparative studies of these two classes of drugs have now been completed. Most have focused on surrogate endpoints, such as blood pressure, renal function, or cough. These studies have generally concluded that ARBs are better tolerated but that the two drug classes otherwise have similar efficacy. The largest clinical trial comparing ARBs and ACE inhibitors thus far completed, Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly (ELITE 2), failed to confirm the results of a smaller study; it did not demonstrate a significant improvement in outcomes (death or hospitalization for heart failure) with an ARB used alone, despite better tolerability. Many longer-term outcome studies with survival endpoints are under way, but most will compare the combination against an ACE inhibitor alone. These studies will define the optimal use of these agents in medicine for decades to come.", 
    "162": "In patients with hypertension, the primary goal is to reduce elevated blood pressure. All of the currently available and approved antihypertensive therapies are, by and large, equally efficacious. Some patient groups and individual patients may, however, respond differentially, and as a result one therapy may be more optimal than another. Overall, for uncomplicated hypertension and particularly for isolated systolic hypertension, diuretics should be considered for first-line therapy. However, comorbid conditions (which occur in > 50% of hypertensive patients) may prompt the need for a more ideal first-line therapy (eg, hypertension with diabetic nephropathy or with left ventricular dysfunction). Regardless, most patients with hypertension will require multidrug therapy to achieve the blood pressure goal, and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor may well be part of that therapy. Many going outcome trials comparing the newer therapies (such as ACE inhibitors) with diuretic-based therapy may redefine or clarify the use of different antihypertensive regimens.", 
    "163": "The development of new antihypertensive agents is becoming even more important. We need better blood pressure control and also agents that treat hypertension as a disease of the vascular endothelium. Recently, it has been shown that blocking the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces blood pressure and decreases the incidence of vascular disease. Another peptide system, the natriuretic peptide system, has also been shown to be important in blood pressure control and volume homeostasis. Because ACE and neutral endopeptidase, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides, are both zinc metalloproteases, new pharmaceuticals that inhibit both enzymes have been developed. The first of these, omapatrilat, has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent and to have great potential for treating congestive heart failure.", 
    "164": "Essential hypertension is frequently associated with the metabolic abnormalities of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. This prevalent clustering of multiple cardiovascular risk factors may help explain the less-than-expected improvement in coronary heart disease mortality provided by simple blood pressure reduction alone. Many antihypertensive medications effectively reduce blood pressure while providing no benefit or even causing a detrimental effect on the associated metabolic abnormalities. beta-Blockers and diuretics tend to negatively affect both glucose tolerance and plasma lipids. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers are most often found to be metabolically neutral. alpha-Blockers provide the most favorable metabolic effects of antihypertensive agents by improving both insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia. The multiple physiologic mechanisms by which blood pressure medications alter plasma lipids are discussed in detail. The effects of antihypertensive medications on postprandial lipid metabolism and the associated postprandial lipemia-induced endothelial dysfunction deserve special attention.", 
    "165": "In this article we emphasize the need for prompt intervention in diabetic patients with high blood pressure in order to protect the heart, brain, kidney, and the vascular tree against arteriosclerotic damage, which is the main cause of mortality in type 1, and particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent placebo-controlled, randomized trials indicate that compared with the nondiabetic population, a lower blood pressure threshold for intervention and a lower target blood pressure are adequate in terms of target organ protection. Although all major classes of antihypertensive drugs have demonstrated a potential benefit in treating diabetic hypertensive patients, blocking the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is especially useful in patients at high risk for myocardial infarction and/or renal damage. The new class of antihypertensive agents that block the angiotensin II receptor have renal effects very close to those observed with ACE inhibitors. The potential role of this new class in the treatment of hypertension in diabetes will depend on the results of ongoing trials.", 
    "166": "Hypertension is associated with alterations in the structure, function, and mechanical properties of large and small arteries. Changes in the endothelium, smooth muscle cell, extracellular matrix, and possibly the adventitia, contribute to complications of hypertension. In large arteries, vascular hypertrophy is found, often with increased stiffness of media components. In small arteries, particularly in mild hypertension, rearrangement of smooth muscle cells around a smaller lumen without changes in media volume (eutrophic remodeling) occurs; in more severe hypertension, hypertrophic remodeling with increased vascular stiffness can be found. Vascular remodeling is accompanied by an increase in the extracellular matrix, particularly collagen deposition. Recent studies have demonstrated that vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction of small and large vessels may be normalized by treatment with some antihypertensive agents (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists, and long-acting calcium channel blockers). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have now been shown to improve outcomes in hypertensive patients, an effect that may in part be related to the vascular protective effects reviewed here.", 
    "167": "Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the most common type of hypertension and the most difficult type to control with antihypertensive therapy. ISH, by definition, is wide pulse pressure hypertension resulting largely from excessive large artery stiffness and representing an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the older aged population. Two major intervention studies of ISH have shown significant benefit in reducing systolic blood pressure with active drug therapy, including thiazide diuretics and calcium receptor antagonists. The optimal treatment strategy is to maximize reduction in systolic blood pressure and to minimize reduction in diastolic blood pressure, thereby reducing pulse pressure. All classes of antihypertensive drugs reduce pulse pressure by means of lowering peripheral resistance, but certain drugs like nitrates, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and other drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system have multiple actions that improve large artery stiffness and early wave reflection and are especially useful in treating ISH in the elderly.", 
    "168": "Efforts to influence medical practice include the formation of expert medical panels who make recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of clinical problems. Despite the considerable expense and effort that go into these activities, it is unclear whether they are successful. Recent studies have evaluated whether recommendations from the Fifth Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC V) published in 1993 influenced antihypertensive prescribing patterns. These included a national study of medications dispensed by retail pharmacies and an evaluation of antihypertensive prescribing patterns in US Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities. Despite recommendations from JNC V that hydrochlorothiazide and beta-blockers be used as first choice for most hypertensive patients, calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were the most common drugs prescribed for hypertension in both 1992 (before JNC V) and 1995 (after JNC V). In retail pharmacies, changes in antihypertensive drug dispensing patterns from 1992 to 1995 reflected increased use of calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors and decreased use of diuretics and beta-blockers, suggesting that JNC V recommendations had little effect on prescribing patterns. Similar patterns of antihypertensive drug use were found in VA facilities. The reasons for the lack of influence of JNC V recommendations on antihypertensive prescribing patterns must be explored and alternative ways of educating health care providers implemented.", 
    "169": "The treatment of hypertension has progressed from a few nontoxic choices to the close to 60 individual drugs listed in the recommendations of the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI). Many combination drugs are also listed for use. The JNC documents have suggested initial therapy with diuretic or beta-blocker since 1993. Practitioners have followed these suggestions or not followed them on the basis of their personal bias. Since the 1997 JNC VI report, several studies that seem to support an individualistic approach to treatment have been reported. This is an exciting time in hypertension research. Clinicians who treat this common disorder will continue to line up as indiscriminate or individualistic prescribers, depending on their interpretation of the available data. We expect the hypertensive patient to be the winner of this increased attention.", 
    "170": "The generation of knockout mice using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells is a powerful tool for physiologic investigations. This experimental approach has provided unique insights into the study of hypertension. Studies using knockout mice have shed new light on blood pressure regulatory mechanisms, molecular mechanisms of end-organ injury, and genetic mechanisms for hypertension. With the development of more accessible approaches for carrying out sophisticated manipulation of the mouse genome, there will be continuing utility of this technique for future studies of hypertension.", 
    "171": "Hypertension is prevalent world-wide, and it affects over 50 million individuals in the United States alone. African Americans (blacks) have a high prevalence of hypertension, develop it at an earlier age, and suffer excessively from severe or malignant hypertension. They also have a high prevalence of target organ damage attributable to hypertension, including left ventricular hypertrophy, stroke, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and coronary artery disease. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is particularly more prevalent in blacks compared to whites, and there is evidence that factors in addition to elevated blood pressure contribute to its pathogenesis. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) is a fibrogenic cytokine that has been implicated in the development and progression of experimental and human renal diseases. We have demonstrated that blacks with ESRD have higher circulating levels of TGF-beta1 protein compared to whites with ESRD. We have also found that hyperexpression of TGF-beta1 is more frequent in blacks with hypertension than in whites. We propose that TGF-beta1 hyperexpression may be an important mediator of hypertension and hypertensive nephrosclerosis. We hypothesize also that the increased frequency of TGF-beta1 hyperexpression may contribute to the excess burden of ESRD in blacks. Based on our hypotheses, and the observations that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists reduce angiotensin II-mediated stimulation of TGF-beta1 production, we propose that treatment with these agents might be efficacious in preventing or slowing the progression of target organ damage in hypertensive blacks.", 
    "172": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) has multiple effects on cardiovascular and renal cells, including vasoconstriction, cell growth, induction of proinflammatory cytokines, and profibrogenic actions. Recent studies provide evidence that ANG II could stimulate intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as the superoxide anion (O2-). This ANG II-mediated ROS formation exhibits different kinetic and lower absolute concentrations than those traditionally observed during the respiratory burst of phagocytic cells, but it likely involves similar membrane-bound NAD(P)H-oxidases. Current evidence suggests that ANG II, through AT1-receptor activation, upregulates several subunits of this multienzyme complex, resulting in an increase in intracellular O2- concentration. ROS are involved in several signal pathways, and redox-sensitive transcriptional factors (AP-1, NF-kappaB) have been characterized. ANG II-induced ROS play a pivotal role in several pathophysiologic situations of vascular and renal cells such as hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, nitrate tolerance, atherosclerosis, and cellular remodeling. Although these perceptions suggest that drugs interfering with ANG II effects (ACE inhibitors, AT1 -receptor antagonist) may serve as antioxidants, preventing vascular and renal changes, the clinical studies are not so straightforward. In fact, only specific risk groups, such as patients with diabetes mellitus or renal insufficiency, may benefit from ACE inhibitors, whereas hard endpoints showed no advantage for ACE inhibitors in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "173": "Essential hypertension is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and is caused mainly by production of oxygen free radicals that can destroy nitric oxide (NO), impairing its beneficial and protective effects on the vessel wall. Antihypertensive drugs can improve or restore endothelium-dependent vasodilation depending on their ability to counteract the mechanisms that impair endothelial function. Although treatment with atenolol gives negative results in peripheral subcutaneous and muscle microcirculation, acute nebivolol exerts a modest vasodilating effect in the forearm circulation. Whether this compound can activate NO production in essential hypertensive patients is controversial. Calcium entry blockers, particularly the dihydropyridine-like drugs, can reverse impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in different vascular districts, including the subcutaneous, epicardial, and peripheral arteries and forearm circulation. In the forearm circulation, nifedipine and lacidipine can improve endothelial dysfunction by restoring NO availability. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, however, seem to improve endothelial function in subcutaneous, epicardial, and renal circulation, but are ineffective in potentiating the blunted response to acetylcholine in the forearm of patients with essential hypertension. Finally, recent evidence suggests angiotensin II receptor antagonists can restore endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine in subcutaneous, but not in the forearm muscle, microcirculation. However, treatment with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist can improve basal NO release and decrease the vasoconstrictor effect of endogenous endothelin-1.", 
    "174": "Hypertension is a common, complex disease phenotype that has been intensively studied to identify susceptibility loci in humans. Candidate genes continue to be uncovered via genetic analysis in model organisms through linkage analysis with families and/or sib-pairs and through association studies using sequence variants in genes that play a role in key pathways regulating blood pressure in humans, such as the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Recent studies exploring the sequence diversity in human candidate genes suggest that the distribution and organization of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and among human populations is complex. Issues related to the use of SNPs in analyzing the genetic determinants of hypertension are illustrated using recent studies on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).", 
    "175": "Diabetes mellitus without previous myocardial infarction carries the same risk of a future myocardial infarction as someone who has had one. Intense glucose, lipid, and blood pressure control in diabetic patients is advocated to reduce cardiovascular events and decrease the incidence of end-stage renal disease, retinal damage, and peripheral vascular disease. Recent studies, including the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, indicate that low-dose diuretics, compared with placebo, reduce fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions but not fatal and nonfatal strokes in diabetic patients. Similarly, captopril (and diuretics) compared with diuretics and beta-blockers decreased fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions but not fatal and nonfatal strokes in the Captopril Prevention Project. Intense blood pressure therapy with captopril and intense blood pressure therapy with atenolol equally lowered macrovascular and microvascular events compared with less intense blood pressure treatment in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. Fewer myocardial infarctions were seen with enalapril than with nisoldipine in the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes trial. Intense blood pressure control with felodipine, enalapril, and hydrochlorothiazide reduced overall cardiovascular events and mortality but not myocardial infarction and strokes in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment trial. Nitrendipine alone or together with enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide decreased fatal and nonfatal strokes and cardiovascular mortality but not myocardial infarctions in the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial. These trials, in aggregate, reinforce the importance of intense blood pressure control, which can be achieved only with combination drug therapy rather than a specific monotherapy drug class recommendation.", 
    "176": "Tight blood pressure control among diabetic and nondiabetic patients with hypertension is perhaps the single most effective intervention used to delay progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The renoprotective actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy is well established. Drugs of this class fairly uniformly reduce glomerulosclerosis, delay the deterioration in renal function, and improve proteinuria, a predictive surrogate marker for renal injury. Calcium- channel blockers (CCBs) in the phenylalkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes also improve proteinuria and delay the progression of renal disease in diabetic and nondiabetic hypertensive nephropathy beyond that attributable to blood pressure control. The short-acting dihydropyridine CCBs worsen proteinuria and accelerate renal injury in both animal models and humans with hypertension or diabetes. A very limited number of studies in animals or humans with hypertension or diabetes have demonstrated at least an additive renoprotective effect when the combination of ACE inhibitors and nondihydropyridine CCBs has been compared with each agent administered as monotherapy. Because patients with impaired renal function and either hypertension or diabetes appear to benefit from aggressive blood pressure reduction, many of these patients will require two or more drugs to achieve the currently recommended blood pressure goals. Combinations of ACE inhibitor and CCB are attractive because they may provide better blood pressure control, appear to be better tolerated with fewer side effects than either drug alone, and may exert a greater renoprotective effect in patients at risk for renal failure than either an ACE inhibitor or a CCB.", 
    "177": "Systemic hypertension is common in patients with acute as well as with chronic renal diseases. Hypertension is an important factor that contributes to the progression of renal failure. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability in patients with chronic renal failure and in those receiving renal replacement therapy. The prevalence of hypertensive nephropathy remains unabated. Hypertension and chronic renal failure are closely interlinked and govern the morbidity and mortality in patients afflicted by these conditions. There is considerable hope that effective control of hypertension may retard the progression of renal disease. Although mere control of hypertension is of paramount importance, specific pharmacologic approaches may offer certain important renal advantages. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, by the virtue of their intrarenal effects, exert favorable consequences on the kidney function (and structure, to some extent), particularly in patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. Both experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors; these drugs slow down the progression of renal disease independent of their antihypertensive actions. More recently, angiotensin-receptor blockers have been shown to exert similar glomerular effects as ACE inhibitors. Preliminary clinical data also suggest a possible role for angiotensin-receptor blockers in the prevention of progression of renal failure. Therapeutic agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin axis hold considerable promise in the management of patients with renal disease by slowing down the rate of decline in renal function.", 
    "178": "This paper reviews findings on the relationship between blood pressure control and the progression of renal disease. Experimental studies demonstrate a correlation between systemic blood pressure and histologic glomerular injury and the delay in progression of renal disease with antihypertensive therapy, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Recent clinical findings are reviewed, including epidemiologic data linking hypertension to subsequent renal disease, and clinical studies showing a beneficial effect on progression of renal disease with lower than usual blood pressure targets.", 
    "179": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in regulating blood pressure, and maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. Angiotensin II is the principal mediator of the RAS and has been implicated in the development of hypertension as well as other forms of cardiovascular and renal disease. Angiotensin II-receptor antagonists are a new class of drugs that inhibit the RAS by selectively blocking the AT(1) receptor. These compounds therefore provide more specific and thorough blockade of the RAS by inhibiting the deleterious actions of angiotensin II at the receptor level, irrespective of how this peptide is formed. The increased specificity of action of angiotensin II-receptor antagonists may also circumvent unwanted side-effects normally associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (eg, cough and angioedema) as these agents do not interfere with the metabolism of other peptides (eg, bradykinin, substance P, etc.). There is still some concern with angiotensin II-receptor antagonists and the long-term effects of hyper-stimulation of the unopposed AT(2) receptor that is caused by elevated levels of angiotensin II. However, it appears that stimulation of the AT(2) receptor may actually contribute to the beneficial effects of angiotensin II-receptor antagonists by counteracting the effects mediated by the AT(1) receptor. Angiotensin II-receptor antagonists display great therapeutic promise in the field of cardiovascular medicine and are currently being exploited as new antihypertensive agents. These drugs have demonstrated safety, efficacy, and tolerability; however, morbidity and mortality data are still lacking. Nonetheless, it is likely that angiotensin II-receptor antagonists will become part of the medical arsenal against cardiovascular and renal disease, thus consideration should be given to their future use as first-line antihypertensive agents.", 
    "180": "Both hypertension and diabetes carry an increased risk of cardiovascular and renal disease and are commonly associated conditions. The prevalence of hypertension in the diabetic population is particularly high, approximately 40% in middle-aged patients with type II diabetes mellitus and increases to approximately 60% by age 75. Hypertension increases an already high risk of cardiovascular disease events associated with diabetes mellitus and is also a risk factor for the development of microalbuminuria and retinopathy. Overall mortality from heart disease has declined substantially in the USA in the past 30 years. The extent of this mortality rate decline has been assessed from representative cohorts, the NHANES I survey (1971-1975) and the NHANES I epidemiologic follow-up survey (1982-1984). Both cohorts were followed prospectively for 8 to 9 years. Mortality rates for heart disease and ischemic heart disease in men and women with diabetes have not decreased to the extent that they have for nondiabetic patients. Although these decreases in men with diabetes were smaller than their nondiabetic counterparts, women with diabetes had increases for both total and ischemic heart disease. Three recent clinical trials have addressed the effects of aggressive intervention in diabetes, particularly older patients with type II diabetes mellitus.", 
    "181": "Clear evidence shows that decreasing blood pressure reduces risks for major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the separate effects of the various classes of blood pressure-lowering agents and the effects of blood pressure lowering in patients at high risk, particularly in the absence of hypertension. Several new randomized controlled trials have been started in the past few years in an effort to address these questions. However, individually, these studies are unlikely to resolve all current uncertainties. For this reason, systematic overviews and meta-analyses of the major ongoing trials are planned. The overviews will be conducted as a collaboration among the principal investigators of the participating trials and will involve about 270,000 patients and 1.1 million patient-years of follow-up. The combined trial results should provide good statistical power to detect even modest differences in the effects of various treatments on major cardiovascular outcomes.", 
    "182": "Central regulation of the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure. In a subset of patients with essential hypertension, sympathetic activation may contribute to the development and maintenance of hypertension. Unlike the first generation of centrally active antihypertensive drugs, the second generation may be superior because of its selectivity to I1-imidazoline receptor and selective binding to the vasomotor center. Lack of a2 effects differentiates moxonidine from clonidine with respect to monoxidine\"s superior side-effect profile (little or no sedation or dry mouth). Clinical trials show that moxonidine is as effective as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (eg, enalapril and captopril), b-blockers (e.g., atenolol), calcium-channel blockers (e.g., long-acting nifedipine), and diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide) in lowering blood pressure and that it has superior tolerability. Thus, central modulation of the sympathetic nervous system has re-emerged as an exciting target for blood pressure reduction. Given the multiple adverse effects of sympathetic stimulation in various disease processes, including congestive heart failure, moxonidine may be the next therapeutic option for the management of hypertension and the prevention of target organ dysfunction.", 
    "183": "Morbidity and mortality data that increasingly favor the use of diuretics and beta-blockers continue to accumulate. Nonetheless, the use of these agents particularly diuretics is viewed as a dated practice. The issue of which antihypertensive drug to use will remain complex and confusing as the marketing juggernauts of the pharmaceutical industry vigorously promote drug classes such as angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, and calcium-channel blockers. A pharmacologic middle ground will probably be reached in the form of fixed-dose combination therapy. Diuretics and b-blockers are mechanistically rational when combined with numerous other drugs; thus, the issue of which drug should be used to begin treatment will be settled by a truce, albeit an uneasy one, favoring the increased use of fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "184": "Angiotensin II is the most active hormone of the renin-angiotensin system. In humans, two angiotensin receptors have been identified: AT(1) and AT(2). In adults, most of the effects of angiotensin II are mediated by the AT(1) receptor; the function of the AT(2) receptor is not yet well established. Angiotensin II has both systemic and local paracrine effects. Increased activity of angiotensin II and stimulation of the AT(1) receptor have been linked to the development of several cardiovascular and renal diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and diabetic nephropathy. Over the past two decades, angiotensin-converting enzymes have been used to manage these diseases. However, the side effects and less-than- maximum therapeutic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, particularly in the decrease of mortality associated with congestive heart failure, have led to the development of AT(1)-receptor blockers.", 
    "185": "The effective treatment of hypertension is associated with improved mortality and morbidity from diseases such as stroke, congestive heart failure, and renal failure. Use of medications that target the renin-angiotensin system for the treatment of hypertension can often achieve the desired decrease in blood pressure while causing a minimum of unwanted side effects. In this paper, the principles of the renin-angiotensin system antagonism are described. The approach to using these medications is discussed with special attention to specific indications as well as common side effects.", 
    "186": "This review attempts to highlight the potential of calcium-channel blockers in the prevention of sequelae of diabetes mellitus and hypertension in patients who have both disorders. Evidence-based medicine is driven by the results of randomized, clinical trials. Major contributions were therefore derived from post hoc analyses of the diabetic patients enrolled in placebo-controlled trials, such as Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur), and Systolic Hypertension in China (Syst-China), and stepped-care blood-pressure-oriented trials, such as the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) and United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). Several studies, such as the Fosiniprl; versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Trial (FACET) and Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial, have compared the relative merits of angiotensin-converting enzyme and calcium-channel blockers in preserving renal function and metabolic balance in diabetic patients with hypertension, but their publications focused on cardiovascular disorders, which were only secondary end points. On balance, the articles reviewed prove that dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers score particularly well in the prevention of cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients with hypertension.", 
    "187": "Antihypertensive treatment may promote cancer through unknown mechanisms. Early retrospective studies implicated reserpine in breast cancer, but the drug was later absolved by prospective analyses. Data from case-controlled studies and several cohort studies suggested an association between the use of a diuretic and the occurrence of renal cell cancer. Several prospective studies showed that treatment with atenolol may increase mortality from malignancy. However, other studies that analyzed data from several thousand patients could not confirm this association. In two prospective studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were associated with increased mortality from malignancy, but a few case-controlled studies showed no association between use of ACE inhibitors and malignancy. In addition, a recent retrospective study showed that long-term use of ACE inhibitors had a protective effect against malignancy. In some studies, calcium antagonists were implicated in increasing the risk for cancer; however, two large case-controlled studies and the combined data from nine observational studies showed a similar risk for malignancy among users and nonusers of a calcium antagonist. Ongoing long-term prospective studies will tell us more about the carcinogenicity of cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "188": "Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. Hypertension is a major risk factor that predisposes individuals with diabetes to the development of renal disease and is very common in patients with diabetes. The benefit of blood pressure control on the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy is being increasingly demonstrated in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have proven renoprotective benefits in human studies, but the results of studies with calcium channel blockers are somewhat inconclusive. The other classes of antihypertensives also may have certain indications in the population of patients with diabetic nephropathy. In this paper we will critically review current strategies for the treatment of hypertension in patients with established diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "189": "Endothelin (ET) is a potent vasoconstrictor associated with various cardiovascular diseases. ET mediates its effects through ET receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells as well as on the vascular endothelium. Furthermore, a neurotransmitter role for ET has been suggested on the basis of experimental and human in vivo studies. ET antagonists are potent tools for studying the effects of ET and its receptors. They have been widely used in vitro and in experimental models of cardiovascular disease, where ET levels are elevated and reactivity to ET is altered. Promising clinical trials in hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure are discussed in this review. Different forms of renal failure are associated with markedly increased ET levels, and ET antagonists experimentally improve renal function in these models. Extrapolating from experimental and first clinical experience, ET antagonists could be useful in the treatment of hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and renal failure, especially in combination with other drugs, ie, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The inhibition of ET-induced stimulation of nociception allows for speculation that ET antagonists might even have analgesic properties.", 
    "190": "The syndrome of chronic heart failure (CHF) is usually attributable to left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), which is most commonly systolic in nature. Many patients who go on to develop heart failure pass through a phase in which they have significant systolic dysfunction but lack clinical symptoms and signs: so-called asymptomatic LVD (ALVD). Treatment of this asymptomatic phase with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can delay the progression to CHF and ameliorate its substantial morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the epidemiology of ALVD. ALVD is at least as prevalent as CHF, is mainly caused by ischemic heart disease, significantly impairs effort capacity, reduces quality of life, and is associated with a substantial mortality rate. As such, it would appear to satisfy many of the criteria required to screen for a disease. The natriuretic peptide hormones (atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide ) are elevated in subjects with ALVD. BNP, in particular, has acceptable accuracy to detect LVD in the general population. In particular, it has a high negative predictive value meaning a low concentration makes the presence of significant LVD highly unlikely. As such it has the potential to be a cost-effective means of filtering subjects suspected of having LVD and allowing more appropriate use of tertiary referrals for specialist assessment and detailed echocardiography.", 
    "191": "The level of inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) provided by standard doses of ACE inhibitors may only be partial during long-term treatment in patients with severe chronic heart failure (CHF). Partial ACE inhibition with time is often referred to as escape from ACE inhibition and labeled ACE escape. Several lines of evidence suggest that ACE escape occurs in patients with severe CHF. Plasma levels of angiotensin II rise above initial values during long-term ACE inhibition, and the effects of ACE inhibitors on cardiac remodeling and lowering of sympathetic nervous system activity attenuate after 1 year of treatment. Moreover, angiotensin II type I receptor blockade (ARB) produces clinical and hemodynamic benefits in patients with CHF who are already receiving ACE inhibitors. The therapeutic implications of ACE escape include evaluation of higher- than-standard doses of ACE inhibitors and routine addition of ARB to ACE inhibition in patients with severe CHF. Data are reviewed to demonstrate that ACE escape reflects inadequate ACE dosage rather than a decrease in ACE inhibition occurring with time.", 
    "192": "Neurohormonal antagonism is now recognized as an essential treatment modality for heart failure. As a prime example, the benefits of blocking the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are clearly established for all four New York Heart Association classes. In this clinical trials review, we discuss two other therapies with neurohormonal targets: beta-blockers and the sympathetic nervous system, and the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone.", 
    "193": "Over the past 20 to 30 years there have been significant advances in the management of heart failure related to improved understanding of pathophysiology, better methods of assessment, and improved drug treatments. The aims of treatment have broadened, with increased emphasis on earlier intervention. Clinical research activity in this area has been considerable, increasingly allowing an evidence-based approach to management. Most earlier trials of treatment were relatively short-term, small-group studies with various clinical end points, including severity of symptoms, exercise performance, and left ventricular function assessment; however, increasingly a higher standard of evidence has been required, including a provision of reliable, large-scale mortality trial data. This has been further encouraged, if not mandated, by the relatively recent appreciation that some agents may demonstrate dissociation of treatment effects, possibly dose related, with improved short-term outcomes but adverse effects on survival with prolonged treatment. The general principles of management of congestive heart failure encompass patient evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis, consideration, and correction of underlying remediable causes and precipitating factors, pharmacological treatment, patient education and counseling, and planned follow-up, as summarized in recently published guidelines. This review focuses primarily on the available randomized controlled clinical trial evidence related to the pharmacological treatment of the clinical congestive heart failure syndrome. Other aspects of management, such as patient education, counseling, and planned follow-up, should be regarded as complementary to pharmacological treatment and important to ensure compliance and optimal long-term outcomes.", 
    "194": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have beneficial effects on arterial compliance and distensibility and favourably modify the arterial pressure waveform in hypertensive patients. The objective of our study was to explore the possible effects of adding an ATII AT1 receptor antagonist to an ACE inhibitor on augmentation pressure, a measure of arterial stiffness, and pulse pressure amplification in patients with poorly controlled essential hypertension.", 
    "195": "We studied a group of 18 patients with poorly controlled hypertension, despite at least three antihypertensive drugs including an ACE inhibitor, before, at 2 h and 2 weeks following the administration of 80 mg of valsartan, an ATII AT1 receptor antagonist. Haemodynamic responses were measured by cuff sphygmomanometry, arterial pulse-wave analysis and the pulse pressure gradient was calculated as the difference between the brachial pulse pressure (cuff sphygmomanometry) and derived aortic pulse pressure (arterial pulse wave analysis).", 
    "196": "Blood pressure decreased significantly (P<0.001) and the effect was more pronounced on central (aortic) pulse pressure than peripheral (brachial) pulse pressure. The pulse pressure amplification increased significantly (from 8+/-3 at baseline vs 12+/-7 at 2 h to 14+/-5 mm Hg at 2 weeks, P<0.01) and the augmentation pressure decreased from a baseline value of 21+/-8 to 11+/-7 at 2 h and 10+/-5 at 2 weeks, (P<0.01) following valsartan.", 
    "197": "The results of our study show that in a group of poorly controlled hypertensives, combining an ATII AT1 receptor blocker to an ACE inhibitor induced a significant fall in blood pressure. The decrease in blood pressure was accompanied by a decrease in augmentation pressure in the ascending aorta with a greater decrease in the central pulse pressure than in the peripheral, favourably increasing pulse pressure amplification between central and peripheral arteries. This effect on arterial stiffness and amplification suggests that combined angiotensin II blockade by adding an AT1 receptor blocker to an ACE inhibitor may have more beneficial effects on the blood pressure curve than simple blood pressure reduction.", 
    "198": "In this study the potential of Fourier transform (FT)-Raman spectroscopy as a method to probe the solid-state form of active substances present in tablets and capsules is explored. Raman spectra were obtained from intact tablets and capsules containing enalapril maleate, prednisolone, form I and form II polymorphs of ranitidine, anhydrous and monohydrate theophylline, and warfarin sodium clathrate. Spectra were also collected from the corresponding drug substances. These studies show that it is possible to detect the active ingredients in the intact dosage form, even where the substance comprises <1% of the total mass of the tablet. Moreover, it is shown that, in some cases, Raman spectroscopy can also be used to investigate the solid-state form of a drug present in the dosage form and even to determine if a mixture of forms are present.", 
    "199": "Despite evidence of therapeutic benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for congestive heart failure and asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, recent studies suggest that in heart failure patients, rates of ACE inhibitor usage in clinical practice remain low. In this study, the medical records of 107 patients with documented LV dysfunction were investigated for patterns of ACE inhibitor usage; 6-month and 1-year outcomes and event rates were evaluated. At index admission, 48% patients did not receive ACE inhibitor treatment, 32% were initiated on treatment, 19% continued on a prior regimen, and 1% were discontinued. Patients seen by a cardiologist were more likely to receive ACE inhibitor treatment (53% vs 35%, p = 0. 172), as were patients with histories of hypertension (60% vs 40%, p = 0.044) or myocardial infarction (56% vs 44%, p = 0.221). Significantly shorter hospitalizations (5.9 vs 9.5 days, p = 0.001) were noted for patients with on-going ACE inhibitor treatment compared with those receiving newly initiated treatment or no treatment. At time of hospital discharge, 102 patients were alive. Of 54 patients who received ACE inhibitors, 67% received an insufficient dose. At a 6-month follow-up, of 51 patients on ACE inhibitors, 23% died or were readmitted to hospital compared with 55% of nonusers (p = 0.001). At 1 year, this event rate was 31% among ACE inhibitor users versus 71% among nonusers (p < 0.0001). Bivariate and multivariate analysis revealed absence of ACE inhibitor use as the only significant variable associated with the event rate (p < 0.0011). Thus, about half of patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction received ACE inhibitors; 2/3 of these did not receive a sufficient dose. ACE inhibitor usage increased with involvement of a cardiologist, presence of coexistent hypertension, or prior myocardial infarction. Ongoing ACE inhibitor therapy was associated with shorter hospitalizations and fewer hospital readmissions or deaths.",

The primary efficacy parameter is defined as the combined incidence of all-cause mortality or hospital admission for documented (1) nonfatal myocardial infarction, (2) myocardial ischemia, (3) heart failure, (4) peripheral vascular disease, (5) cerebrovascular accident and/or (6) end-stage renal disease.", 
    "201": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and non-peptide blocker of AT1 receptors losartan on endothelial function of the shoulder artery in patients with congestive cardiac insufficiency. The examination covered 96 patients (mean age 46.71 +/- 4.13) with stable effort angina (functional class II-III) and circulatory insufficiency (NYHA functional class II-III) having end-diastolic left-ventricular volume > 160 ml, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, sinus rhythm, cardiothoracal index > 0.55 units. Patients with fibrillar tachyarrhythmia, high grade blocks, pacemaker migration, artificial pacemaker, myocardial infarction were not included in the trial. The patients were randomized into 3 groups 32 patients each. In addition to basic therapy patients of group 1 received long-acting nitrates, digoxin, aspirin and furosemide; group 2--enalapril in daily dose 10 mg; group 3--losartan in daily dose 25 mg. A course of treatment lasted 12 weeks. Endothelial function was assessed by high resolution echography, dopplerography performed before and after temporary occlusion of the shoulder artery and sublingual nitroglycerin. In patients with cardiac insufficiency, accelerated blood flow in the shoulder artery after its temporary occlusion promoted realization of the vasoconstrictory reaction. This was verified as endothelial dysfunction. In the course of the treatment all the patients achieved insignificant increase of the shoulder artery initial diameter. After sublingual intake of nitroglycerin vasodilation was also insignificant. 12-week enalapril and losartan prevented vasoconstriction in the shoulder artery in response to quicker circulation following arterial occlusion. However, higher maximal flow speed did not correspond to the increment in the artery diameter after the occlusion in any group. The flow-induced vasodilation was more pronounced in the enalapril group. Losartan group had a trend to an increase in the inner diameter of the shoulder artery. It is shown that enalapril and losartan in congestive cardiac insufficiency improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation caused by nitroglycerin. Enalapril demonstrated stronger ability than losartan to reverse endothelial dysfunction in patients with cardiac insufficiency resultant from ischemic heart disease.",

Highly statistically significant intraclass correlation coefficients were observed both in MZ (r = 0.421; P = 0.008) and in DZ (r = 0.488; P = 0.004). Because all tests of genetic variance and heritability were not significant, the hypothesis of genetic variance and heritability of pHo was rejected. The preferred model of a likelihood-based analysis included an additive genetic influence (A), a common environmental influence (C), and an individually unique environmental influence (E), accounting for 8%, 39%, and 53%, of pHo variance, respectively. No relationship between pHo and pACE or PAI-1:ag was detected.",

    "229": "The cardiovascular and other actions of angiotensin II (Ang II) are mediated by AT(1) and AT(2) receptors, which are seven transmembrane glycoproteins with 30% sequence similarity. Most species express a single autosomal AT(1) gene, but two related AT(1A) and AT(1B) receptor genes are expressed in rodents. AT(1) receptors are predominantly coupled to G(q/11), and signal through phospholipases A, C, D, inositol phosphates, calcium channels, and a variety of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Many AT(1)-induced growth responses are mediated by transactivation of growth factor receptors. The receptor binding sites for agonist and nonpeptide antagonist ligands have been defined. The latter compounds are as effective as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases but are better tolerated. The AT(2) receptor is expressed at high density during fetal development. It is much less abundant in adult tissues and is up-regulated in pathological conditions. Its signaling pathways include serine and tyrosine phosphatases, phospholipase A(2), nitric oxide, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. The AT(2) receptor counteracts several of the growth responses initiated by the AT(1) and growth factor receptors. The AT(4) receptor specifically binds Ang IV (Ang 3-8), and is located in brain and kidney. Its signaling mechanisms are unknown, but it influences local blood flow and is associated with cognitive processes and sensory and motor functions. Although AT(1) receptors mediate most of the known actions of Ang II, the AT(2) receptor contributes to the regulation of blood pressure and renal function. The development of specific nonpeptide receptor antagonists has led to major advances in the physiology, pharmacology, and therapy of the renin-angiotensin system.",

    "231": "Retrospective review of medical and pharmacy claims.", 
    "232": "We reviewed integrated medical and pharmacy claims data from 6 independent-practice-association model health maintenance organizations to identify patients diagnosed with CHF. Of the approximately 1.4 million people enrolled in these managed care plans during the study period (January through December 1994), a total of 2777 patients (mean age, 56.9 years) met the study criteria, which included diagnostic codes for CHF and claims eligibility of at least 1 year. We reviewed the charges incurred by patients diagnosed with CHF for the 6 months after the initial CHF medical claim. We also examined the treatment received by each of these patients.", 
    "233": "During the study period, 378 of the 2777 patients with CHF (14%) were admitted to the hospital at a cost of almost $3 million (an average of $7863 per hospitalized patient). Seventy-eight percent of the study population received prescription drugs, at an average per-patient cost of $942. The most commonly prescribed drug class was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, prescribed for 38% of patients. Calcium channel blockers were prescribed for 33% of patients, but beta-blockers were prescribed for only 18% of patients. Hospitalization accounted for 54% of the total cost for CHF treatment, with prescription drugs accounting for 38%.", 
    "234": "Congestive heart failure represents a significant financial burden within a non-elderly managed care population. Improved management of the condition is needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality, as well as the costs of treatment, associated with CHF. Considerable data indicate that drugs such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality of CHF. Further investigation is needed into whether increased use of prescription pharmaceuticals may reduce hospitalization rates and overall costs for CHF in this setting.", 
    "235": "The goals of antihypertensive therapy are to lower blood pressure and prevent end-organ damage without side effects, which affect quality of life. The antihypertensive drugs, regardless of class, all lower blood pressure, but they vary in their mechanisms of action, side-effect profiles, suitability for patients with other comorbid conditions, and ability to protect against the long-term sequelae of hypertension. The Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) recommends diuretics and beta-blockers as first-line therapy for uncomplicated hypertension, with diuretics also being strongly preferred for patients with isolated systolic hypertension or hypertension and heart failure and beta-blockers being strongly preferred for patients who have had a myocardial infarction (MI) and those with hypertension and angina, atrial tachycardia, or atrial fibrillation. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be cardioprotective and renoprotective in patients with diabetes or impaired left ventricular (LV) function, the JNC-VI recommends them as first-line therapy in patients with diabetes with proteinuria, heart failure, and MI complicated by LV dysfunction. It recommends calcium channel blockers for hypertensive patients with angina, long-acting dihydropyridines for those with isolated systolic hypertension, and the nondihydropyridines for those with atrial tachycardia or fibrillation, diabetes, and proteinuria. The angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) share many of the organ-protective effects of ACE inhibitors when studied in animal models. They are effective in lowering blood pressure and have a very benign side-effect profile; however, these agents have not been available long enough to ascertain their efficacy in protecting against long-term complications.", 
    "236": "This review discusses important issues related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). ACEIs have been shown in clinical trials to slow progressive renal, cardiac, and vascular disease. The Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends ACEIs as alternative first-line therapy in patients with essential hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure, and in hypertensive diabetics who also have renal disease. Many of the therapeutic benefits derived from ACEIs are thought to be class effects. There are certain distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features for some of the ACEIs such as differences in absorption, protein binding, half-life, and metabolic disposition. In appropriate doses, they all lower blood pressure similarly. In the treatment of HTN and hypertensive renal disease, a class effect appears to be applicable when selecting an agent. It is less likely that ACEIs are interchangeable in the treatment of congestive heart failure because maximal cardioprotective tissue effect rather than blood pressure normalization is the goal. In addition, for some agents clinical trials that demonstrate decreased morbidity or mortality are currently lacking.", 
    "237": "This article examines evidence of the improved clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in clinical practice, in particular in the areas of hypertension, diabetic nephropathies, post-myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences may exist among this class, however, these may not be clinically relevant when the drugs are given in equivalent doses. Although additional studies are necessary before a class effect can be assumed for each of these outcomes, it is important for clinicians to consider all of these outcomes when using ACEIs.", 
    "238": "Recent research has led to the discovery of potent selective or mixed endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), ECE/neutral endopeptidase24.11 (NEP) and ECE/NEP24.11/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. There is also increasing evidence, that the functions of the endothelin (ET), renin-angiotensin and NEP systems for the regulation of the cardiovascular homeostasis are connected by a complex regulation network. It will be the challenging task of future research with the newly available selective and mixed ECE-1 inhibitors to show whether the combined inhibition of more than one cardiovascular system is superior to selective inhibition.", 
    "239": "Proteinuric nephropathies either of diabetic or nondiabetic origin tend to develop renal structural damage associated with progressive renal function decline over time. In proteinuric glomerular disease excessive protein reabsorption by proximal tubular epithelial cells modulates tubular cell function to the extent that cell growth and their phenotypic expression of growth factors and inflammatory chemokines and cytokines is upregulated. Recent evidence is available that renal tubular cells synthesize endothelins (ETs), a family of peptides with potent vasoconstrictor and proliferation properties, and that overloading these cells with proteins induces a dose-dependent increase in the synthesis and release of ET-1. This peptide, accumulating in the renal interstitium, eventually participates in activation of the sequence of events that leads to interstitial inflammation and ultimately renal scarring. Increased renal synthesis of ET-1 occurs in vivo as documented in several animal models of proteinuric progressive nephropathies, in which enhanced renal ET-1 gene expression as well as the excretion of the peptide in the urine correlated with the urinary protein excretion rate. Similarly, in patients with chronic renal disease an association has been found between increased urinary excretion of ET-1 and renal damage. A strong argument in favor of ET-1 as a mediator of renal injury derives from preclinical studies with selective and non-selective ET receptor antagonists that have became available in the past few years. They block the effect of ET to their specific receptors called ET(A) and ET(B), and have been reported to have a renoprotective effect in several animal models of progressive renal disease, including in rats with remnant kidney or experimental diabetes as well as mice with lupus nephritis. The peptide nature of some of these compounds, which are currently appearing in the literature, may however hamper their future use in humans. Administration of nonpeptide ET receptor antagonists to humans would hopefully overcome this problem and possibly provide a new therapeutic approach for patients with renal disease who do not adequately respond to the currently available therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.", 
    "240": "Endothelin (ET)-1 is a potent vasoactive peptide which is mostly secreted toward the vessel wall and the circulatory levels of which are quite low; for these reasons changes in plasma ET-1 may be difficult to detect even after the application of strong stimuli, which, in theory, should profoundly alter its production. We have examined the effects of a number of such stimuli and found that in humans the only one which consistently increased plasma ET-1 was the exposure to hypobaric hypoxia; moreover under these circumstances the increments in plasma ET-1 were correlated with the changes in pulmonary systolic pressure, suggesting a role of circulating ET-1 in the adaptation of pulmonary vessels to high altitude. In contrast no consistent changes of ET-1 were observed in response to sympathetic activation induced either by exposure to cold, standing, reduction in blood pressure and blood withdrawal. In response to angioplasty of renal artery stenosis a concomitant reduction in plasma ET-1 and angiotensin II (AngII) was observed in patients who, prior to angioplasty, had a high degree of activation of the renin system, supporting the possibility that in these specific conditions AngII may actually stimulate ET-1 production in vivo.", 
    "241": "The purpose of the present review dedicated to the kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system is to highlight the pathophysiological role of this complex system in kidney diseased patients. We will focus mainly on the nature of bradykinin and its active metabolite, des-Arg9-bradykinin. After the description of their properties, their metabolism and their receptors, we will show the recent evidence about the renal kallikrein-kinine system and its autocrin/paracrin role. This will allow to the nephrologist a better understanding of the role of these vasoactive peptides not only in the beneficial aspects, but also in the acute side-effects, of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "242": "Although proteinuria is traditionally regarded as the result of glomerular damage, recent evidence suggests that proteinuria can directly cause renal damage through lysosomal injury, growth factor induced tubular fibrosis and transcriptase genes which trigger vasoactive and inflammatory renal damage. The renin angiotensin system which releases angiotensin, a most powerful vasoconstrictor and mediator of mesangial cell proliferation and matrix expansion, has been associated with progressive renal injury. This paper reviews the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphisms in the genesis of progressive renal failure, as well as their role in the response of proteinuria to ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor antagonist (ATRA) therapy.", 
    "243": "The deletion/insertion polymorphism of the ACE gene has 3 genotypes DD, ID and II. Reported studies on the association of ACE gene polymorphisms with patients with IgA nephritis and progressive renal failure, including their response to ACEI or ATRA therapy, were reviewed.",

Therapy with ACEI and or ATRA may be beneficial in patients with IgA nephritis with renal impairment and non-selective proteinuria as such patients may respond to therapy with improvement in protein selectivity, decrease in proteinuria and improvement in renal function.", 
    "245": "ACE genotypes appear to predict antiproteinuric response to ACEI therapy. ACEI/ATRA therapy probably modifies pore size distribution by reducing the radius of large non-selective pores, causing the shunt pathway to become less pronounced resulting in less leakage of protein into the urine.", 
    "246": "Over 11 million Americans have both diabetes and hypertension-comorbid diseases that strongly predispose people to both renal as well as cardiovascular (CV) injury. Hypertension substantially contributes to CV morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. Diabetes is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. Furthermore, hypertension and diabetes are particularly prevalent in certain populations, such as African-Americans and Native Americans. Since the 1994 Working Group Report on Hypertension and Diabetes, a large body of clinical trial data has affirmed the original blood pressure goal of less than 130/85 mmHg recommended to preserve renal function and reduce CV events in people with hypertension and diabetes. Data that are more recent have emerged, however, to support an even lower diastolic blood pressure goal, ie, 80 mmHg, in order to optimally preserve renal function and reduce CV events in people with diabetic nephropathy. A review of clinical trials indicates that more than 65% of people with diabetes and hypertension will require two or more different antihypertensive medications to achieve the new suggested target blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. The purpose of this report is to update the previous recommendations with a focus on level of blood pressure control, proteinuria reduction, and therapeutic approaches to achieve these goals. We provide an evidence-based approach, integrating data from the major clinical trials that were designed as randomized prospective, long-term studies that had as a primary endpoint either progression of diabetic nephropathy or reduction in CV events. This report also addresses socioeconomic and cultural barriers that hinder achievement of blood pressure goals. Lastly, the report discusses approaches to resolve cultural barriers, both physician- and patient-derived, that interfere with achievement of lower blood pressure goals.", 
    "247": "Studies using either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or type 1 (AT(1)) angiotensin II (ANG II)-receptor blockers indicate that ANG II is a mediator of progressive injury in diabetic nephropathy. However, suppression of the systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) generally has been shown in diabetes mellitus. Evidence suggests that intrarenal RASs within glomeruli and proximal tubules may be activated with hyperglycemia, leading to stimulation of local ANG II production, which may exert feedback inhibition of systemic renin release. Once formed, intrarenal ANG II exerts most of its well-described effects through binding to AT(1) receptors that are abundantly present in cells of the glomeruli, tubules, vasculature, and interstitium. Thus, AT(1)-receptor activation increases vascular resistance, reduces renal blood flow, and stimulates production of extracellular matrix in the mesangium and tubulointerstitium. Recent studies suggest that the adult kidney also expresses type 2 (AT(2)) ANG II receptors in glomeruli, tubular segments, and vasculature. AT(2)-receptor activation is associated with increased intrarenal nitric oxide production, stimulation of natriuresis, and inhibition of cell growth and matrix synthesis, effects that oppose those of kidney AT(1) receptors. A number of studies have shown a reduction in kidney AT(1)-receptor expression in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that the balance between AT(1)- and AT(2)-receptor-mediated cell-signaling events may be a determinant of progression rate in diabetic nephropathy and that unopposed stimulation of AT(2) receptors by ANG II with use of AT(1)-receptor blockers may contribute to the beneficial properties of these agents. Determination of the expression pattern of AT(2) receptors in diabetes and further definition of the role of AT(2) receptors in opposing the detrimental effects of AT(1) receptors may lead to more selective targeting of the RAS in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "248": "The purpose of our study has to determine the myocardial protective effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor temocapril (TEM, 7 mg/kg/day) simultaneously administered with doxorubicin (Adriamycin). Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally administered a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg of doxorubicin (each dose of 1.0 mg/kg x 15) for 3 weeks, and divided into TEM-untreated and -treated rats. Seven control rats were injected with saline intraperitoneally. Body weight, hemodynamics, and echocardiographic measurements including quantitative analysis of ultrasonic integrated backscatter (IB) were obtained for 12 weeks after treatment. Finally, rats were killed for histopathologic study. At 6 weeks, end-diastolic left ventricular diameter (LVD) and percentage fractional shortening (%FS) were similar in TEM-treated and TEM-untreated rats, but cyclic variation of IB (dB) significantly decreased in TEM-untreated rats (7.3 +/- 1.2; control rats, 9.7 +/- 0.9; p < 0.01). At 12 weeks, %FS decreased in TEM-untreated rats (26.1 +/- 6.1%: TEM-treated rats, 34.2 +/- 6.2; p < 0.05), and calibrated IB (dB) in TEM-untreated rats (15.5 +/- 0.5) increased as compared with that in TEM-treated rats (12.1 +/- 0.7; p < 0.01). Interstitial collagen accumulation increased in TEM-untreated rats and was inhibited in treated rats. Simultaneous administration of TEM with doxorubicin was beneficial in preventing doxorubicin-induced myocardial damage, and myocardial tissue characterization was useful for the early detection of myocardial damage and the assessment of therapy.", 
    "249": "In previous articles, we have shown that the combination of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor delapril (12 mg/kg/day) and the diuretic indapamide (1 mg/kg/ day) was able to prolong the life span significantly in salt-loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp). Because this finding was partly dependent on the antagonism of salt-loading effects by pharmacologic induction of diuresis, which prevented any increase in blood pressure values, we decided to evaluate whether lower doses of the combination could be equally protective without changing the progression of hypertension. Thus, we studied several treatments with progressively lower doses of delapril (6, 3, or 1.5 mg/kg/day) combined with indapamide (0.5, 0.25, or 0.125 mg/kg/day) or hydrochlorothiazide (2.5, 1.25, or 0.625 mg/kg/day) in salt-loaded SHRsp. Salt-loaded untreated animals were considered to be the control group. In agreement with previous experiments, control rats reached 50% mortality approximately 7 weeks after the beginning of salt loading. The combination of delapril and hydrochlorothiazide at the two lowest doses was not able to delay animal death significantly, whereas treatment with delapril and indapamide at the lowest dose was effective (50% survival rate, 15 weeks). The groups treated with the highest dose of delapril and hydrochlorothiazide or with the intermediate or highest dose of delapril and indapamide did not reach 50% mortality by the end of the experiment, at 44 weeks of treatment (i.e., when animals reached age 1 year). Only the highest delapril and indapamide doses were able to increase diuresis, but for a relatively short period. None of the treatments was able to lower or control blood pressure levels adequately. Therefore, blood pressure levels by themselves were not predictive of rat mortality. In contrast, the maximal value of proteinuria in the weeks preceding death was inversely correlated with the survival time. In conclusion, this study shows that low doses of an ACE inhibitor in combination with a diuretic can be effectively protective in a model of severe hypertension, independent of any change in blood pressure levels.", 
    "250": "We previously developed a model of acute cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced vasomotor nephrotoxicity in rabbits. In the present study, we evaluated the role of endothelin (ET), angiotensin II (AII) and adenosine in this experimental model. All animals received CsA (25 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. Renal function parameters were first measured in a 30-min period, showing renal insufficiency in all animals. Then, rabbits were administered bosentan (10 mg/kg; antagonist of ET(AB) receptors), perindopril (20 microg/kg; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), or theophylline (1 mg/kg; adenosine receptor blocker at micromolar concentrations). After a 40-min equilibration period, renal function was assessed again for 30 min. Bosentan, perindopril and theophylline significantly reduced renal vascular resistance (-28+/-5%, -39+/-7% and -8+/-3%, respectively), and improved renal blood flow (+38+/-15%, +66+/-16% and +20+/-5%), glomerular filtration rate (+33+/-9%, +52+/-13% and +50+/-8%) and diuresis (+48+/-9%, +76+/-19% and +73+/-14%). Filtration fraction was unchanged with bosentan, decreased with perindopril (-10+/-9%) and increased with theophylline (+24+/-5%). The overall results suggest that ET, AII and adenosine are involved in the acute renal failure induced by CsA. We conclude that CsA administration for 5 days induced a vasomotor nephropathy with ET- and adenosine-mediated afferent arteriolar constriction as well as ET- and AII-mediated efferent arteriolar constriction.", 
    "251": "The development and validation of a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method for the determination of the related substances of 2-[N-[(S)-1-Ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-(1S, 3S, 5S)-2-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3-carboxylic acid (ramipril) in Altace capsules is described. The method utilizes an ion-pairing agent and a simple two-step gradient for the separation of ramipril and ten related substances from each other in a 40-min run time. Four of the related substances are ramipril diastereomers. To the best of our knowledge, no method described previously in the literature has demonstrated resolution of ramipril from this set of related substances. No method for the determination of the related substances of ramipril is currently described in the United States Pharmacopoeia or the European Pharmacopoeia. The proposed method was validated with respect to accuracy, precision, linearity, and specificity. Also, the method was determined to be robust with regards to the following parameters: mobile phase apparent pH: mobile phase organic content: mobile phase perchlorate concentration; detection wavelength and time dependence of sample and standard stability.", 
    "252": "Over the past 50 years, many advances have been made in slowing the progression of renal disease from various causes. These advances have been primarily linked to defining new lower levels for blood pressure goals as well as understanding the importance of proteinuria reduction. To achieve these goals, it is also appreciated that agents that lower blood pressure must also lower proteinuria. This is not true for all antihypertensive drug classes--notably, direct-acting vasodilators, alpha-blockers, and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. Interestingly, antihypertensive agents that also reduce proteinuria have been associated with cardiovascular risk reduction. Moreover, an understanding of combinations of antihypertensive medications that provide additive reductions in proteinuria may be even more efficacious for slowing renal disease progression. It is hoped that these advances and the projected advances in pharmacogenetics will reduce the current increasing incidence of people going on dialysis.", 
    "253": "In the present study, we investigated whether the correction of endothelial dysfunction can be independent of the normalization of high blood pressure levels by enalapril in deoxycorticosterone (DOCA-salt) hypertensive rats. Aorta morphology and the response of aortas with (E+) and without (E-) endothelium to noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside were studied. DOCA-salt hypertensive and normotensive (control) rats were or were not treated with enalapril (5 mg/day/rat in the drinking fluid) for 1, 7, or 15 days. Blood pressure was measured before and after 1, 3, 7, and 15 days of enalapril treatment. Enalapril normalized the high blood pressure levels in 50% (responders) of the hypertensive rats after 3 to as many as 15 days but not after 1 day of treatment. Initial blood pressure levels were not different between responders and nonresponders. Blood pressure levels of normotensive control rats were not altered by enalapril treatment. The tunica media of aortas of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats treated or not treated with enalapril for 15 days was thicker than aortas from normotensive rats. Enalapril corrected the reduced response to acetylcholine observed in aorta from hypertensive rats from the first day of treatment. This treatment rendered aortas from normotensive control rats more sensitive (lower EC(50)) to acetylcholine without a change in the maximal responses. The responses to sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide donor, were unaltered in aorta E+ or E- from control and hypertensive rats before and after enalapril treatment. Enalapril did not correct the increased responses to noradrenaline observed in aorta E+ of hypertensive rats. These results suggest that the high blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertension is not correlated with the altered response to endothelium-dependent agents (either dilator or constrictors). The endothelium-dependent vasodilation by antihypertensive agents can be corrected independently of normalization of blood pressure levels or the vascular morphology.",

    "256": "Despite substantial rises in plasma angiotensin II concentrations (P<0.001) which caused pressor effects (P<0.003) at the highest dose, angiotensin II infusion did not affect local plasma t-PA, PAI-1 or vWf concentrations. In contrast, bradykinin caused substantial dose-dependent increases in blood flow and t-PA release (>100 ng/100 ml of tissue/min) in the infused forearm (P<0. 001 for both) without affecting plasma PAI-1 or vWf concentrations.", 
    "257": "Despite high local concentrations with breakthrough of significant systemic effects, angiotensin II did not affect acute endothelial cell t-PA, PAI-1 or vWf release in healthy men.

Left ventricular wall motion index was assessed during hospitalization (WMI-1) and at 6 weeks (WMI-2). N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels were elevated at all time points, to a greater extent in anterior compared to inferior infarction (P < 0.05). A biphasic profile of plasma concentration was observed in anterior infarction with peaks at 14-48 h and 121-192 h. This was sustained at 6 weeks. N-terminal pro- brain natriuretic peptide at 73-120 h was the best independent predictor of WMI-1 (P < 0.005). N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was higher at all times in patients who received ACE inhibitor therapy compared to those who did not (P < 0.005). N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide at 73-120 h (R(2) = 17.7%, P = 0.005) and previous myocardial infarction (R(2) = 5.3%, P < 0.05) were independent predictors of poor outcome (WMI-2 < or = 1.2 or death by 6 weeks).",

    "263": "At 16 weeks after irradiation, renal function showed deterioration without any significant differences between groups. At 24 weeks after irradiation, all irradiation dose groups with or without enalapril treatment showed some improvement in functional terms. Morphological evaluation revealed that enalapril had a marked beneficial effect on renal radiation injury in the 10 Gy single-dose group and at 8 weeks after irradiation. At 16 weeks after irradiation the histological appearance of the dose groups with or without enalapril treatment was similar.",

In the present study, in order to analyse the mast cell proteases simultaneously, we investigated a method for the measurement of carboxypeptidase A, chymase and tryptase in human vascular tissues. 2. Human vascular tissues were homogenized in 10 mmol/L phosphate buffer containing 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 or 1.8 mol/L KCl and 0.1% non-idet P-40 and samples were then extracted. Because carboxypeptidase A and chymase convert angiotensin (Ang)I to Ang-(1-9) and AngII, respectively, the extracts were incubated with AngI in the presence of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The extract prepared in buffer with over 0.8 mol/L KCl converted AngI to Ang-(1-9) and AngII. Formation of Ang-(1-9) and AngII plateaued in extracts with 1.0 and 1.2 mol/L KCl, respectively. 3. The formation of Ang-(1-9) and AngII in the extract with 1.2 mol/L KCl was inhibited by inhibitors of carboxypeptidase A and chymase, respectively, suggesting that Ang-(1-9) and AngII were generated from AngI by carboxypeptidase A and chymase, respectively. 4. Using a specific tryptase substrate, tryptase activity was detected in extract in buffer with over 0.8 mol/L KCl and reached a plateau at concentrations of KCl over 1.0 mol/L. 5. These findings show that the maximum activity of carboxypeptidase A, chymase and tryptase was detected in extracts of human homogenized vascular tissues in buffer at 1.2 mol/L KCl. The present study demonstrates a new method for the simultaneous measurement of proteases derived from mast cells in humans.", 
    "266": "Assessment of intrarenal doppler signals is of particular importance in screening for renal artery stenosis. We studied the effect of acute ACE-inhibition (1,25 mg enalaprilate i.v.) on intrarenal resistive indices in 10 hypertensive patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis versus 10 patients with essential hypertension. Any changes limited to poststenotic vessels could possibly improve the diagnostic value of duplex sonography. After ACE-inhibition a significant fall of the intrarenal Resistive Index occurred in both patient groups. In cases of unilateral renal artery stenosis we saw a tendency to an increased side difference of the Resistive Index due to a greater fall on the poststenotic side. Therefore a clear advantage of duplex scanning after acute ACE-inhibition due to a limited effect of enalaprilate on poststenotic vessels was not found. The results suggest that the vascular resistance and not only the degree of renal artery stenosis is of significance for the characteristics of the doppler signal.", 
    "267": "Captopril is an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which is widely used as an anti-hypertensive agent. In addition to its ability to reduce blood pressure, captopril has a number of other biological activities. Recently the drug was shown to inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis in human activated peripheral T cells and human lung epithelial cells. In this study, we investigated whether captopril blocks activation-induced apoptosis in murine T cell hybridomas, and found that captopril inhibited IL-2 synthesis and apoptotic cell death upon activation with anti-CD3 antibody. In addition, captopril inhibited an inducible caspase-3-like activity during activation-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, captopril did not interfere with Fas signalling, since anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis in Fas+ Jurkat cells was unaffected by the drug. Furthermore, we examined whether captopril blocks activation-induced apoptosis by interfering with expression of Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), or both on T cell hybridomas. FasL expression on activated T cells was significantly inhibited by captopril, whereas up-expression of Fas was partially inhibited, as assessed by cell surface staining. Taking all data together, we conclude that captopril prevents activation-induced apoptosis in T cell hybridomas by interfering with T cell activation signals. Captopril has been reported to induce systemic lupus erythematosus syndrome, and our findings may be useful for elucidating the mechanism of captopril-induced autoimmunity.", 
    "268": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are the antihypertensives of choice in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). ACEI by decreasing the synthesis of aldosterone, the main regulator of serum potassium, predispose to the development of hyperkalemia. Although hyperkalemia with administration of ACEI is uncommon in patients with a normal renal function, a preexisting abnormality in potassium hemostasis, as seen in patients with chronic renal failure, may increase the risk of hyperkalemia.", 
    "269": "To determine the predictors of development of hyperkalemia (K >5.1 mEq/l) in patients on ACEI, we retrospectively reviewed medical records of 119 patients followed in our renal clinic.", 
    "270": "The mean age of the patients was 56 +/- (SD) 13 (range 20-84) years. Sixty-three percent were males, and 37% were females. Sixty-seven percent had a history of diabetes. Eighty five percent of the patients had CRF [creatinine clearance (CrCl) <80 ml/min]. The baseline serum Cr was 2.3 +/- 1.2 (range 0.6-6.9) mg/dl, and the CrCl was 50 +/- 27.5 ml/min. Of the 119 patients 46 (38.6%) developed hyperkalemia (mean K 5.68 +/- 0.3, range 5.2-6.7 mEq/l). Ninety-six percent of the patients who developed hyperkalemia had CRF, and 84% were diabetics. Pearson product-moment correlation revealed a significant positive correlation of hyperkalemia with Cr and a negative correlation of hyperkalemia with CrCl and HCO(3) (Cr: r = 0.42, p < 0.0001; CrCl: r = -0.34, p < 0.0001; HCO(3): r = -0.41, p < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed diabetes and serum creatinine to be the main predictors of hyperkalemia. In 31 patients hyperkalemia resolved either with a low-potassium (2 g/day) diet or with diet and a decrease in the dose of ACEI. In 15 patients ACEI had to be discontinued due to persistent hyperkalemia.", 
    "271": "We conclude that hyperkalemia is common in patients with CRF on ACEI. The majority of the patients who develop hyperkalemia on ACEI have CRF and diabetes. A large number of patients with CRF require discontinuation of ACEI due to hyperkalemia and are deprived of their renoprotective effects.",

    "273": "The isolated hearts were arrested for 60 minutes with warm blood cardioplegia given at 20-minute intervals and were reperfused for 60 minutes. The control group (n = 10) received standard cardioplegia and the captopril group (n = 10) received cardioplegia supplemented with captopril (2 mmol/L). Cardiac function, myocardial metabolism, and cardiac release of circulating adhesion molecules were assessed before and after cardioplegic arrest.", 
    "274": "Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and -dp/dt were significantly (p<0.05) lower and coronary blood flow was significantly (p<0.05) greater in the captopril group than the control group during reperfusion. The captopril group resulted in significantly (p<0.05) less cardiac release of lactate, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances during reperfusion. Cardiac release of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was significantly (p<0.05) less in the captopril group at 60 minutes of reperfusion.",

    "276": "The effect of chronic treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, temocapril, on prevention of endothelial dysfunction was evaluated in an experimental model of diabetes mellitus. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was impaired while endothelium-independent relaxation to nitroglycerin was unaltered in diabetic aortic ring segments. Treatment of diabetic animals with temocapril prevented the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation without altering responses to nitroglycerin. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was largely due to nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxation; however, a small but significant portion of relaxation in aortic rings from temocapril-treated diabetic rats was resistant to inhibition by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-nitroarginine.", 
    "277": "Soluble guanylyl cyclase activity and its stimulation by diethylamineNONOate was measured in aortae from hypertensive TGR(mREN2)27 rats (TGR) and Sprague-Dawley controls. Superoxide dismutase was added in vitro to evaluate the contribution of oxidative breakdown of nitric oxide (NO) by superoxide anions. Expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Basal and stimulated soluble guanylyl cyclase activity was significantly reduced in TGR rats, addition of superoxide dismutase had no effect. Expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits was not different between strains. The independent contribution of hypertension and the overactive renin-angiotensin system to soluble guanylyl cyclase subsensitivity was assessed after normalization of TGR's blood pressure by the Ca(2+)-channel blocker amlodipine or the angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor enalapril. Soluble guanylyl cyclase activity in TGR was slightly increased by amlodipine and almost completely restored by enalapril. In conclusion, TGR showed desensitized vascular soluble guanylyl cyclase, depending on their overactive renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "278": "ACE2, the first known human homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), was identified from 5' sequencing of a human heart failure ventricle cDNA library. ACE2 has an apparent signal peptide, a single metalloprotease active site, and a transmembrane domain. The metalloprotease catalytic domains of ACE2 and ACE are 42% identical, and comparison of the genomic structures indicates that the two genes arose through duplication. In contrast to the more ubiquitous ACE, ACE2 transcripts are found only in heart, kidney, and testis of 23 human tissues examined. Immunohistochemistry shows ACE2 protein predominantly in the endothelium of coronary and intrarenal vessels and in renal tubular epithelium. Active ACE2 enzyme is secreted from transfected cells by cleavage N-terminal to the transmembrane domain. Recombinant ACE2 hydrolyzes the carboxy terminal leucine from angiotensin I to generate angiotensin 1-9, which is converted to smaller angiotensin peptides by ACE in vitro and by cardiomyocytes in culture. ACE2 can also cleave des-Arg bradykinin and neurotensin but not bradykinin or 15 other vasoactive and hormonal peptides tested. ACE2 is not inhibited by lisinopril or captopril. The organ- and cell-specific expression of ACE2 and its unique cleavage of key vasoactive peptides suggest an essential role for ACE2 in the local renin-angiotensin system of the heart and kidney.

    "279": "We aimed to assess in patients with congestive heart failure whether dual inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat is better than ACE inhibition alone with lisinopril on functional capacity and clinical outcome.", 
    "280": "We did a prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel trial of 573 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV congestive heart failure, left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less, and receiving an ACE inhibitor. Patients were randomly assigned omapatrilat at a daily target dose of 40 mg (n=289) or lisinopril at a daily target dose of 20 mg (n=284) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was improvement in maximum exercise treadmill test (ETT) at week 12. Secondary endpoints included death and comorbid events indicative of worsening heart failure.", 
    "281": "Week 12 ETT increased similarly in the omapatrilat and lisinopril groups (24 vs 31 s, p=0.45). The two drugs were fairly well tolerated, but there were fewer cardiovascular-system serious adverse events in the omapatrilat group than in the lisinopril group (20 [7%] vs 34 [12%], p=0.04). There was a suggestive trend in favour of omapatrilat on the combined endpoint of death or admission for worsening heart failure (p=0.052; hazard ratio 0.53 [95% CI 0.27-1.02]) and a significant benefit of omapatrilat in the composite of death, admission, or discontinuation of study treatment for worsening heart failure (p=0.035; 0.52 [0.28-0.96]). Omapatrilat improved NYHA class more than lisinopril in patients who had NYHA class III and IV (p=0.035), but not if patients with NYHA class II were included.", 
    "282": "Our findings suggest that omapatrilat could have some advantages over lisinopril in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure. Thus use of vasopeptidase inhibitors could constitute a potentially important treatment for further improving the prognosis and well being of patients with this disorder.", 
    "283": "Blocking the formation of angiotensin II with converting enzyme inhibitors is an established intervention for kidney disease. The advent of antagonists of the angiotensin II receptor has increased the options for inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In adults, angiotensin II antagonists have antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects similar to those of converting enzyme inhibitors and an adverse effect profile similar to that of placebo. In children, no information is available on angiotensin II antagonists. A total of 20 children (aged 4 to 17 years) with chronic kidney disease received the angiotensin II antagonist irbesartan given once daily. They had hypertension (n = 11), overt proteinuria (n = 3), or both (n = 6). At last follow-up, 2 to 17 months after starting irbesartan (median dosage: 3.3 mg/kg body weight daily), arterial pressure was significantly reduced: the systolic value by 16 [6-22] and the diastolic value by 11 [4-22] mmHg (median and interquartile range). In nine patients with proteinuria, the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio significantly decreased by 145 [105-209] mg/mmol. The frequency of reported adverse events was similar before and with irbesartan.", 
    "284": "In children with chronic kidney disease the effects of the angiotensin II antagonist irbesartan on arterial pressure and proteinuria mimic those observed with the converting enzyme inhibitors. The effectiveness of a single daily dose and the paucity of side-effects suggest that angiotensin II antagonists expand therapeutic options for inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in children.", 
    "285": "The importance of the criterion of Quality of Life (QOL) for compliance with antihypertensive drugs led us to study the QOL of 51 hypertensives receiving 2.5 mg of the new formulation of prazosin (sustained release), compared with 49 subjects treated by a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril 10 mg), in a double-blind randomized trial. QOL, assessed by means of a 22 item self-administered questionnaire, improved significantly with prazosin, during the 24 weeks of the trial. In the intention to treat analysis, the global score of QOL increased from 46.3 +/- 8.4 to 51.6 +/- 8.9 (p < 0.0001); the covariance analysis showed that the improvement was obtained as early as the 8th week. A similar favourable evolution was observed for anxiety, retardation and anhedonia components, computed from the same questionnaire. No significant difference in QOL evolution was found between prazosin and enalapril. Both treatments proved equivalent in respect of efficacy on blood-pressure values, and tolerance, estimated through the number of dropouts or side-effects. These results confirm the benefit to QOL of hypertensive patients of the new formulation of prazosin.", 
    "286": "This study investigated the presence and effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) within the rat and guinea-pig prostate glands. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that CGRP immunoreactive nerve fibres are sparsely distributed throughout the prostatic fibromuscular stroma in both species. These CGRP immunopositive nerve fibres shared a similar distribution profile but were not colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive nerve fibres which also innervate the prostatic stroma of these species. Nerve terminals within rat and guinea-pig prostatic tissues were electrically field stimulated (60 V, 0.5 ms, 10 Hz, 20 pulses every 60 s). In guinea-pig preparations, application of human alpha-CGRP, rat adrenomedullin or rat amylin (0.1 nM-1 microM) had no effect on responses to field stimulation. In contrast, both rat and human alpha-CGRP (10 pM-300 nM), rat adrenomedullin (0.3 nM-1 microM) and rat amylin (3 nM-1 microM) concentration-dependently inhibited electrically evoked contractile responses in the rat prostate. The relative order of potency was rat alpha-CGRP=human alpha-CGRP>rat adrenomedullin>rat amylin. The inhibition by rat alpha-CGRP of field stimulation-induced contractions in the rat prostate was competitively antagonized by human CGRP((8-37)) (1, 3 and 10 microM) with a pA(2) of 6.20+/-0.13. Rat alpha-CGRP (10 nM) attenuated contractile responses of the rat prostate to exogenously added noradrenaline (1-100 microM). Inhibitory concentration-response curves to rat alpha-CGRP in rat prostates were unaffected by preincubation in either glibenclamide (10-100 microM), N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (10 microM), bestatin (10 microM), captopril (10 microM) or phosphoramidon (3 microM). Our results indicate that CGRP-induced inhibition of electrically evoked contractions in the rat prostate occurs through activation of postjunctional CGRP(2) receptors which act independently of a K(ATP) channel or nitrergic mechanisms. Degradation of rat alpha-CGRP via peptidases does not appear to occur in the rat prostate.", 
    "287": "Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in its pathophysiology, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the cornerstone of therapy. However, HF continues to progress despite this therapy, perhaps because of production of angiotensin II by alternative pathways, which lead to direct stimulation of the angiotensin II receptor. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy alone or in combination with the ACE inhibitor is a promising approach to block the RAS and slow HF progression more completely.", 
    "288": "The current medical literature on the pathophysiology of HF and the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was extensively reviewed.", 
    "289": "Evidence from basic science, experimental animals, and clinical trials provides data on the safety and efficacy of RAS inhibition with ACE inhibitors and ARBs as monotherapy and in combination. Data from the Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly (ELITE) II trial indicate that ARBs alone do not appear to be more effective than ACE inhibitors in HF, but studies evaluating their use in combination are currently ongoing.", 
    "290": "The addition of an ARB offers more complete angiotensin II receptor blockade of the RAS than can be obtained by ACE inhibitors alone. Combination therapy preserves the benefits of bradykinin potentiation offered by ACE inhibitors while providing potential antitrophic influences of AT(2) receptor stimulation and may play an increased role in the treatment of chronic HF in the future.", 
    "291": "In the heart of uremic animals and patients, the number of capillaries per volume of myocardium is reduced. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated increased cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in the left ventricle of uremic animals. Therefore, whether treatment with a selective ET(A)-receptor antagonist prevented such capillary-myocyte mismatch was investigated. Twenty-four h after subtotal nephrectomy, rats were left untreated or started on treatment with the ET(A)-receptor antagonist LU 135252 (20 mg/kg per d) and with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril (0.3 mg/kg per d), respectively. BP was monitored by telemetry. Myocardial capillary length density was analyzed by stereologic techniques that avoid anisotropy artifacts. In addition, cardiac ET-1 protein and mRNA were measured using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Changes in cardiac ET(A)-and ET(B)-PCR. receptor mRNA were measured using reverse transcription-PCR. Fifteen wk after subtotal nephrectomy, significantly reduced left ventricular capillary length density (3307 +/- 535 mm/mm(3)) was found compared with sham-operated controls (3995 +/- 471 mm/mm(3)); this was also seen in animals that were treated with trandolapril (3503 +/- 533 mm/mm(3)) but not in animals that were treated with LU 135252 (3800 +/- 303 mm/mm(3)). The results support a role of ET-1 in the genesis of left ventricular capillary/myocyte mismatch in uremia.",

The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of beta-casein (beta-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of beta-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and kappa-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the beta-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC(50)s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.",

This question is frequently addressed by using analysis of variance-type methods that fail to incorporate information regarding the repeated sampling design of the experiment. In this paper, we provide an introduction to nonstatisticians of two approaches for analyzing such data. The procedures can be performed by using available software. These methods are illustrated on data from a preclinical study conducted by ZymoGenetics.", 
    "299": "Patients with diabetes constitute a large group among patients with ischaemic heart disease, and their risk of repeated cardiovascular events is large. Due to this, there is increasing focus on intervention against the increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes from studies on patients with ischaemic heart disease show that intervention with thrombolysis, aspirin, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins have similar relative benefit among patients with diabetes, but because of the greater risk in these patients, the absolute benefit is increased. In spite of this, intervention is less common among patients with diabetes, a fact that should be corrected. Direct intervention targeted at the metabolic disorder in ischaemic heart disease has only been investigated in the DIGAMI study, where glucose/insulin treatment followed by long term treatment with insulin was compared to conventional treatment. The mortality was lower in the insulin treated group after one to four years of follow up, a promising result which is currently being investigated in the DIGAMI-2 study.",

Eight months after receiving a renal allograft his hypertension worsened and his packed red cell volume raised to 53.7% Enalapril was started and a 500 ml phlebotomy was performed. In three occasions packed red cell volumes decreased excessively and enalapril was discontinued. Finally, the drug was replaced with losartan, normalizing blood pressure values and stabilizing packed red cell volumes. This case illustrates the different reductions in packed red cell volumes induced by enalapril and losartan. These differences could have a therapeutic relevance.",

After adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking status, educational level, country, alcohol drinking and hypolipidaemic drug treatment, untreated hypertensive subjects had higher levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, apoproteins A-I and B and PAI-I activity than normotensive subjects. On univariate analysis, diuretics decreased total and HDL-cholesterol and apoproteins A-I and B; those differences remained after multivariate adjustment. Treatment with beta-blockers decreased total and HDL-cholesterol, apoprotein A-I and LpA-I, and this effect remained after multivariate adjustment. Calcium channel blockers decreased total cholesterol and apoproteins A-I and B; those differences remained significant after multivariate adjustment. ACE inhibitors decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides, apoprotein B and LpE:B; and this effect remained after multivariate adjustment.

Trypsin, which can solubilize ACE from the membrane, cleaves the protein at the same site. The use of structurally related hydroxamic acid-based zinc metalloproteinase inhibitors indicate that tumour necrosis factor-alpha convertase, a member of the ADAMs ('a disintegrin and metalloproteinase') family of proteins, is not involved in the proteolytic release of ACE, or in the constitutive or regulated alpha-secretase release of the amyloid precursor protein from a human neuronal cell line.",

The effect of bradykinin was enhanced by the ACE inhibitor, ramiprilat. 2. The facilitated release of noradrenaline in rat ventricle by bradykinin was blocked by the beta2-receptor antagonist HOE-140. This response is also reduced by removing the endocardium, suggesting the release of a mediator from the endocardium. 3. The facilitated noradrenaline release by angiotensin II and bradykinin was blocked by the angiotensin receptor antagonist saralasin to the same extent. In contrast, losartan caused only minor blockade in a range of vascular and cardiac tissues. This suggests that angiotensin and bradykinin exert these responses by interacting with a prejunctional receptor different from the established AT1 subtype. 4. These results suggest that bradykinin mediates facilitation of noradrenaline release via the local release of angiotensin onto an atypical AT1 receptor.",

Both ACEI and AT(1)A reduce myocardial IS by a bradykinin-mediated process. It is unclear, however, whether the combination of ACEI and AT(1)A produces a more pronounced IS reduction than each of these drugs alone. Forty-six enflurane-anaesthetized pigs underwent 90 min low-flow ischaemia and 120 min reperfusion. Systemic haemodynamics (micromanometer), subendocardial blood flow (ENDO, microspheres) and IS (TTC-staining) were determined. The decreases in left ventricular peak pressure by ACEI (by 9+/-2 (s.e. mean) mmHg), AT(1)A (by 11+/-2 mmHg) or their combination (by 18+/-3 mmHg, P<0.05 vs ACEI and AT(1)A, respectively) were readjusted by aortic constriction prior to ischaemia. With placebo (n=10), IS averaged 20.0+/-3.3% of the area at risk. IS was reduced to 9.8+/-2.6% with ramiprilat (n=10) and 10.6+/-3.1% with candesartan (n=10). Combined ramiprilat and candesartan (n=10) reduced IS to 6.7+/-2.1%. Blockade of the bradykinin-B(2)-receptor with icatibant prior to ACEI and AT(1)A completely abolished the reduction of IS (n=6, 22.8+/-6.1%). The relationship between IS and ischaemic ENDO with placebo was shifted downwards by each ACEI and AT(1)A and further shifted downwards with their combination (P<0.05 vs all groups); icatibant again abolished such downward shift. The combination of ACEI and AT(1)A enhances the reduction of IS following ischaemia/reperfusion compared to a monotherapy by either drug alone; this effect is mediated by bradykinin.", 
    "311": "Diabetic nephropathy develops in approximately 35% of diabetics and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in North America. End-stage renal disease is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and a large economic burden. Treatments that can prevent or postpone diabetic nephropathy are important therapeutic advances. Interventional studies in type I diabetes and type II diabetes have demonstrated a beneficial effect of improved glycemic control and good blood pressure control in delaying the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been found to be effective in delaying the progression of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive as well as normotensive diabetics with early and advanced nephropathy. Microalbuminuria or incipient diabetic nephropathy is the earliest clinical expression of diabetic nephropathy and identifies patients at risk of further progression. Advanced or overt nephropathy is associated with a greater risk for coronary artery disease and mortality. It is possible that interventions aimed earlier in the cascade at preventing the development of overt nephropathy may result in greater clinical benefit. There is compelling evidence of the benefit of ACE inhibitors in preventing the progression of incipient diabetic nephropathy to overt diabetic nephropathy in normotensive diabetics.",

The inhibition was accompanied by a small decrease in plasma ANG II concentration, which became significant at 1 microgram. kg(-1). min(-1). After the infusate was changed back to the vehicle, the depression of drinking and arterial pressure continued for >2 h, although plasma ANG II concentration rebounded above the level before SQ infusion. By contrast, infusion of anti-ANG II serum (0.01-1 microgram. kg(-1). min(-1)) did not suppress drinking and arterial pressure, although plasma ANG II concentration decreased to undetectable levels. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and plasma osmolality, which influence drinking rate in eels, did not change during SQ or antiserum infusions. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays only a minor role in the vigorous drinking observed in seawater eels. The results also suggest that the antidipsogenic and vasodepressor effects of SQ in seawater eels are not due solely to the inhibition of ANG II formation in plasma.", 
    "313": "An intact renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during nephrogenesis is essential for normal renal development. We have shown previously that neonatal inhibition of the RAS, either with ANG II type 1-receptor blockade or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, induces irreversible renal abnormalities. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether an interrupted RAS can be compensated for by exogenous administration of another important renal growth-promoting factor, the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Rats were treated daily with either the ACE inhibitor enalapril (10 mg/kg), recombinant human IGF-I (3 mg/kg), or the combination enalapril + IGF-I from perinatal day 3 to 13. Urinary concentrating ability, renal function, and renal morphology were assessed at adult age. The gene expression and localization of IGF-I, its receptor, and the growth hormone receptor (GHR) were investigated during ongoing ACE inhibition. The present study demonstrates normalized renal function and histology in enalapril + IGF-I-treated animals. Ongoing ACE inhibition suppressed the medullary IGF-I mRNA expression and altered the local distribution of both IGF-I and GHR. Thus the present study provides evidence for an interaction between the RAS and GH/IGF-I axis in renal development.",

The present study was designed to test the effect of clamping plasma ANG II concentrations ([ANG II]) by simultaneous infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and ANG II on RBF autoregulation in halothane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Autoregulation was defined as the RBF response to acute changes in renal perfusion pressure (RPP). Regulation was defined as changes in RBF during long-lasting changes in RPP. The results showed that a prolonged reduction of RPP reset the lower limit of autoregulation from 85 +/- 1 to 73 +/- 2 mmHg (P < 0.05) and regulated RBF to a lower level. Reduction of RPP to just above the lower limit of autoregulation (88 mmHg) induced regulation of RBF to a lower level within 10 min. Clamping [ANG II] per se reset the lower limit of autoregulation to 62 +/- 5 mmHg. In this case, reduction in RPP to 50 mmHg did not induce a downregulation of RBF. We conclude that ANG II plays an important role in the resetting of the autoregulation limits. The ability to regulate RBF to a new level as a response to changes in RPP also depends on changes in [ANG II].",

To assess all-cause mortality in heart failure patients treated with losartan, a meta-analysis including 1,896 patients was performed on 6 controlled, double-blind, multiple-dose studies, regardless of sample size or duration of follow-up. A combination of logarithmic (log) odds ratios with a continuity correction was utilized for the meta-analysis. Treatment groups were comparable with regard to demographic characteristics, heart failure characteristics, and concomitant cardiovascular therapies. Concomitant use of open-label angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was not allowed in any study. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction obtained in individual studies ranged from 23% to 31%. Seven hundred forty patients were randomized to control therapy and 1,154 patients were randomized to losartan therapy. There were 36 deaths (3.12%) in the losartan groups compared with 47 in the control groups (6.35%) during the double-blind periods. The odds of dying in the losartan groups were 0.51 times (0.31 to 0.81) that of dying in the control groups (p = 0.004). In this analysis, treatment with losartan provided a beneficial effect upon survival. However, because the number of deaths in these studies is relatively small and the follow-up relatively short, a large confirmatory study is needed to assess the mortality benefit of losartan compared with an ACE inhibitor.",

To this end, we compared the vasoprotective effect of chronic treatment with zofenopril (plus SH-group) versus lisinopril (no SH-group), or N-acetylcysteine (only SH-group) in myocardial infarcted (MI) heart failure rats. After 11 weeks of treatment, aortas were obtained and studied as ring preparations for endothelium-dependent and -independent dilatation in continuous presence of indomethacin to avoid interference of vasoactive prostanoids, and the selective presence of the NOS-inhibitor L-NMMA to determine NO-contribution. Total dilatation after receptor-dependent stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) was attenuated (-49%, P<0.05) in untreated MI (n=11), compared to control rats with no-MI (n=8). This was in part due to impaired NO-contribution in MI (-50%, P<0.05 versus no-MI). At the same time the capacity for generation of biologically active NO after receptor-independent stimulation with A23187 remained intact. Chronic treatment with n-acetylcysteine (n=8) selectively restored NO-contribution in total dilatation to ACh. In contrast, both ACE-inhibitors fully normalized total dilatation to ACh, including the part mediated by NO (no significant differences between zofenopril (n=10) and lisinopril (n=8)). Zofenopril, but not lisinopril, additionally potentiated the effect of endogenous NO after A23187-induced release from the endothelium (+100%) as well as that of exogenous NO provided by nitroglycerin (+22%) and sodium nitrite (+36%) (for all P<0.05 versus no-MI). We conclude that ACE-inhibition with a SH-group has a potential advantage in improvement of endothelial dysfunction through increased activity of NO after release from the endothelium into the vessel wall. Furthermore, this is the first study demonstrating the selective normalizing effect of N-actylcysteine on NO-contribution to ACh-induced dilatation in experimental heart failure.", 
    "340": "The renin angiotensin system was first described over 100 years ago and is still the focus of intense clinical and basic science investigation. The renin angiotensin system was demonstrated to play a major pathogenetic role in hypertension. The development of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme and specific receptor blockers for angiotensin-II represent a major advance in the treatment of elevated blood pressure. However, the renin angiotensin system is intimately involved in a number of conditions that increase the risk for atherosclerosis. Components of the renin angiotensin system have demonstrated to play a significant role in the initial phases of atherosclerosis. Additionally, plaque vulnerability and the potential for an acute atherosclerotic event are also modulated by the renin angiotensin system. Angiotensin-II plays a significant role in the balance between intravascular clot formation and fibrinolytic potential. Therefore, blocking the generation of angiotensin-II or inhibiting its binding to specific receptors may decrease the subsequent risk for unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. Increased renin activity has been correlated as a statistical risk factor for coronary heart disease and converting enzyme inhibition has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of acute ischemic events. This review will center on the role of modulation of the renin angiotensin system as a means to alter the clinical course of coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "341": "The vascular system exhibits altered growth, calcium responses and metabolism during hypertension. To relate such changes, we compared histological, tension and metabolic responses in the aorta from 32-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, and SHRs treated with Verapamil (V) and ACE-inhibitor, Trandolapril (T) as well as a combination of the two treatments (C). Vascular hypertrophy was apparent in the SHRs. Contractile responses induced by 50 mmol/1 KCl and 2.5 mmol/1 Ca2+ were significantly lower in the SHR (64.4 mN/mm2 vs. 49.2 mN/mm2), but an associated increase in Ca2+ -sensitivity (EC50 of extracellular Ca2+ (mumol/1): SHR, 456 vs. WKY, 616) normalised tension generating ability. All treatments led to significant decreases in blood pressure, although only T and C treated animals became normotensive with concomitant normalisation of vascular hypertrophy. An increase in oxygen consumption was apparent in the SHR aorta, which was associated with significant differences in the activities of key metabolic enzymes. Anti-hypertensive treatment normalised many of the metabolic parameters, with the C therapy being the most efficacious. We conclude that the treatment of hypertension by combined therapy leads to a better normalisation of structural, contractile, and metabolic parameters in the SHR, than either treatment alone and that metabolic changes with the pathology are resolved with appropriate therapy.", 
    "342": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is now recognized as a major risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality, a component of which is independent of associated coronary heart disease. The mechanisms that underlie this risk are increasingly understood and include disturbances in cardiac electrophysiology, coronary perfusion and myocardial contractile function. Recognition that regression of LVH confers prognostic benefit has focused attention on developing optimal treatments to achieve this. Early studies suggested that regression is achievable using a variety of antihypertensive classes. Many of these early studies were either poorly controlled or of inadequate size to provide reliable comparisons between different agents. Subsequently a number of meta-analyses, based on selections of these early studies, have been published. More recently, a number of well-designed prospective clinical trials have been published or are under way. In summary of these results: (1) the extent of regression seen in early studies appears to be greater than that reported in recent large, well-designed trials, possibly due to regression to the mean in small studies with high coefficients of variation for echocardiographically measured left ventricular (LV) mass index; (2) meta-analyses based on these early studies tend to suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be most effective in regressing LVH; (3) recent larger trials [Treatment Of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS), the Veterans Administration (VA) study, and Left ventricular hypertrophy: Indapamide Versus Enalapril (LIVE)] indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics maintain a strong place in achieving regression of LVH. Long-term studies currently under way should help clarify the prognostic benefit associated with regression of LVH using antihypertensive therapy. Future work will focus on whether regression of LV mass is associated with reversal of the underlying pathophysiology of hypertrophy and, ultimately, whether prevention of LVH should be the optimal goal.",

Czech and Slovak general practitioners participated in the study. Home BP measurement was performed by the patients always during the 4 days preceding the visit by the general practitioner. Home BP was measured twice daily, \"trough\" and \"peak\" values (in the morning before the use of drug and then between noon and 2.00 p.m.), each time twice. The OMRON device enables to print out the measured values. Casual hypertension was defined as casual BP 140/90 mmHg and higher, \"home hypertension\" was defined as a mean BP higher than 130/85 mm Hg from 8 home BP measurements performed during the last 2 days before the visit by the general practitioner higher than 130/85 mmHg.",

The decrease in BP was observed both in the casual BP values and in the home BP values. Normalisation of the casual diastolic BP (diastolic BP lower than 90 mmHg) occurred in 59.3% of the patients after the first month of treatment, in 75.4% of the patients after 3 months of treatment, and in 78.5% of patients after 6 months of treatment. Only 2.1% of patients dropped out from the study due to side effects. These data demonstrated a very good efficacy and tolerance of perindopril. Only 62.6% of general practitioners showing interest in home BP measurement at the informative meetings joined the study and 14-19% of patients of the whole studied group did not use home BP at all. In general the interest of general practitioners and their patients observed in this study was less than that observed among the cardiologists in our previous study. The incidence of the \"white coat phenomenon\" was related to its definition, it increased when using a less strict definition and decreased during the course of therapy, in parallel to the normalisation of BP. Home BP values were significantly higher during the first 2 day of measurement then during the last 2 days of measurement (of the 4-days period). \"White coat hypertension\" could be observed in 9.4% of the group during the study. Home BP measurement also enabled to disclose \"white coat normotension\" defined as normal casual BP values and hypertensive home BP values. \"White coat normotension\" occurred at the end of the study in 26.3% of the patients. This relatively high number of patients with \"white coat normotension\" could be partly due to a short period of rest at home before taking home BP values.",

Home BP measurement provides better information about the efficacy of hypertension treatment and discloses \"overtreatment\" (\"white coat hypertension\") as well \"undertreatment\" (\"white coat normotension\").

For both investigation periods arithmetic means of plasma creatinine were calculated. The length of the investigation period was intentionally used as the sole criterium for inclusion in the group of patients. In nine patients during treatment the serum creatinine levels rose. The authors found a close positive correlation between the rise of plasma creatinine levels and the patients' age (correlation coefficient r = 0.59, n = 13, p < or = 0.02). Between the rise of creatinine (dependent variable) and independent variables (daily enalapril dose, initial creatinine blood level, the drop of the median arterial pressure during enalapril treatment) no close relationships were found. The rise of creatinine during enalapril treatment can be explained by a drop of the filtration pressure in the glomeruli during dilatation of the vas efferens. This drop of the filtration pressure was manifested by a slight increase of plasma creatinine only in patients with a drop of the renal perfusion (haemodynamic) reserve, i.e. in more advanced age groups.", 
    "349": "Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular illness and death. Efforts to reduce that risk have led to recommendations for a wide array of nondrug and drug therapies. Choosing the optimal first-line drug for hypertensive patients should address a hierarchy of treatment goals: decrease in morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension, decrease in blood pressure and other surrogate markers, good tolerance, dosing convenience and low cost. This article examines the evidence for angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as a class of first-line antihypertensive drugs in light of these treatment goals. Overall, the evidence does not support the use of ACE inhibitors as first-line drugs in the management of most patients with hypertension, although they have proven benefit as second-line drugs for the treatment of congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction secondary to myocardial infarction.",

Full characterization of soluble and tissue ACE in both LEW/N and F344/N rat strains showed that soluble ACE levels in serum and exudate were 1.5 fold higher in the F344/N rats than those in LEW/N rats. In addition, the soluble ACE level was inversely correlated with the exudate volume. However, the specific ACE activity and its catalytic properties were identical in both strains.

We measured 2-deoxyglucose uptake by using L(6) skeletal muscle cells. In the presence of 1 nmol/L of insulin, 1 micromol/L of enalaprilat enhanced insulin-induced glucose uptake from 89.2+/-8. 1 to 138.0+/-13.6 pmol/h per mg protein. The stimulation of glucose uptake with enalaprilat was blocked to 92.7+/-7.8 pmol/h per mg protein by 10 micromol/L HOE 140 (a BK B2 receptor antagonist). In the presence of 1 nmol/L of insulin, exposure to 10 micromol/L BK stimulated glucose uptake from 89.2+/-8.1 to 171.6+/-10.1 pmol/h per mg protein. However, in the absence of insulin, BK could not enhance glucose uptake. One hundred nanomoles per liter of tyrphostin A-23 and genistein, which are tyrosine kinase inhibitors, significantly decreased the BK-induced glucose uptake from 142.0+/-8.4 to 87.6+/-6. 4 and 85.2+/-7.3 pmol/h per mg protein, respectively.

In this study, we investigated whether DZN would lower established proteinuria by improving glomerular sclerosis in spontaneously hypertensive corpulent rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus. DZN treatment was compared with treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril (LIS) alone, and DZN in combination with LIS. Combination therapy was used to examine any additive effect of either drug alone in the reduction of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis. Both male and female rats age 6 months with established proteinuria were used. The rats were allocated randomly to 1 of 4 groups: untreated, DZN treated, LIS treated, or a combination of DZN and LIS treatment. Drug treatment was continued for 16 weeks. The results show that (1) either drug alone or in combination significantly lowered systolic blood pressure; (2) DZN, LIS, or combination therapy reduced albuminuria at 16 weeks of treatment from baseline by 38.61+/-5.77%, 30.70+/-4. 21%, and 42.17+/-4.77% (mean+/-SE), respectively. No difference in albuminuria was observed among the 3 groups of rats; (3) the fractional mesangial area, which was 20.55+/-3.77% in untreated rats, was significantly reduced to 11.18+/-1.32% in DZN-treated rats, with a further reduction to 8.72+/-0.64% in LIS-treated rats and to 3.48+/-0.35% in rats treated with DZN+LIS; and (4) DZN but not LIS significantly improved plasma glucose levels in spontaneously hypertensive corpulent rats (untreated 21.06+/-0.97 mmol/L versus DZN treated 15.81+/-0.93 mmol/L or DZN+LIS treated 17.38+/-1.10 mmol/L; P<0.025 to 0.005). Thus, the data suggest that 16-week treatment with either DZN or LIS improves established proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis, but combination therapy is superior to either DZN or LIS alone in preventing glomerular sclerosis in type 2 diabetic rats with hypertension.", 
    "361": "In hypertensive heart disease, no data are available on the repair of coronary resistance vessels in patients after long-term ACE inhibitor treatment. Fourteen patients with essential hypertension were studied with coronary flow reserve and with transvenous endomyocardial biopsy before and after 12 months of antihypertensive treatment with perindopril (4 to 8 mg/d, mean 5.9+/-2.3 mg/d). Left ventricular muscle mass index decreased by 11% (from 145+/-41 to 128+/-36 g/m(2), P=0.04). Maximal coronary blood flow was increased by 54% (from 170+/-46 to 263+/-142 mL. min(-1). 100 g(-1), P=0.001), and minimal coronary vascular resistance was diminished by 33% (from 0.67+/-0.21 to 0.45+/-0.19 mm Hg. min. 100 g. mL(-1), P=0.001); consequently, coronary reserve increased by 67% from 2.1+/-0.6 to 3. 5+/-1.9 (P=0.001). Structural analysis revealed regression of periarteriolar collagen area by 54% (from 558+/-270 to 260+/-173 microm(2), P=0.04) and of total interstitial collagen volume density by 22% (from 5.5+/-3.8 Vv% to 4.3+/-3.2 Vv%, P=0.04), whereas arteriolar wall area was slightly but not significantly reduced. Long-term therapy with the ACE inhibitor perindopril induces structural repair of coronary arterioles that is mainly characterized by the regression of periarteriolar fibrosis and associated with a marked improvement in coronary reserve. These findings indicate the beneficial reparative effects of ACE inhibition on coronary microcirculation in hypertensive heart disease.",

In a non-randomized study, the effect of captopril on the improvement of proteinuria in GSD Ia patients with microalbuminuria was investigated. A positive effect has been shown for the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients. Microalbuminuria was defined as albumin/creatinine ratio (mg/mmol) more than 2.5 in spot urine. Nineteen (52.7%) out of 36 patients had microalbuminuria, and 8 patients received captopril at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day. Microalbuminuria was evaluated periodically during the follow-up period. Of the captopril-treated patients, one was lost to follow-up. In the remaining 7 patients, urinary albumin excretion normalized in 3 patients (42.9%) and decreased at least by 50% in another 3 patients (42.8%) after 6 months of treatment. One patient, who was the oldest, did not have any benefit. In untreated patients, only two patients had a decrease in microalbuminuria of more than 50%. Patients with microalbuminuria had significantly higher blood lactate (p < 0.05) and plasma triglyceride (p < 0.01) concentrations and significantly lower blood bicarbonate concentration (p < 0.05) than those patients without it. Additionally, the patients with microalbuminuria had been diagnosed earlier than those without microalbuminuria (p < 0.05). Patients with microalbuminuria have more severe clinical and laboratory findings than those without microalbuminuria. Captopril at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day seems to be effective in at least 50% of GSD Ia patients with microalbuminuria.",

The norbornene unit is readily prepared by a desymmetrization reaction and is easily incorporated into a peptide chain. Depending upon the exact nature of the norbornene unit, it is possible to form structures which resemble parallel beta-sheets, antiparallel beta-sheets or beta-turns.

More recently, it has been used to guide the use of ACE inhibitors after myocardial infarction. The results of major clinical trials leave us in no doubt that ACE inhibitors are useful in the treatment of patients after myocardial infarction. The results of economic analysis unanimously indicate that ACE inhibitors are cost effective when used to treat patients after myocardial infarction. Any comparison of the different treatment strategies available suggests that all are comparably cost effective and argues for the widest possible use of ACE inhibitors in this setting. The evidence suggests that, in this context as in so many others, ACE inhibitors remain under-utilized.",

The sensitivities for unilateral RAS or bilateral RAS (i.e., stenosis that was at least unilateral) were, respectively, 88% and 88% for captopril renography and 82% and 94% for aspirin renography (not significant). The overall specificity was 75% for captopril renography and 83% for aspirin renography (not significant). Tracer uptake ratios, time to peak activity, and percentage of 20-min tracer retention were also not significantly different for captopril and aspirin renography. Subgroup analysis of modest (50-75%) and severe (> or =75%) RAS, or of plasma creatinine greater than 120 micromol/L, also showed no difference between captopril and aspirin renography.",

The patients were divided into 2 groups: group A who were diagnosed before 1989 and group B diagnosed after 1990. Basic characteristics at diagnosis, including age, NYHA functional class, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, were similar between these 2 groups. Calculated survival rate at 5 years was 90.0% in group B in contrast to 62.3% in group A. Event-free survival also improved in group B. In group B, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were more frequently used than in group A (p<0.0001) whereas digitalis and other positive inotropic agents were significantly less used. Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly improved during the follow-up period in patients treated with beta-blockers compared with those not treated with beta-blockers. These data indicate a significant improvement in the survival of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy after 1990, which may be explained by the change of medical treatment, especially the use of beta-blockers.", 
    "370": "We previously reported that MET-88, 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium) propionate, improved left ventricular diastolic dysfunction induced by congestive heart failure (CHF) in rats. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanism by which MET-88 improved the cardiac relaxation impaired in CHF rats. The left coronary artery of the animals was ligated, and the rats were then orally administered vehicle (control), MET-88 at 50 or 100 mg/kg or captopril at 20 mg/kg for 20 days. Myocytes were isolated from the non-infarcted region in the left ventricle, and cell shortening and [Ca2+]i transients were measured with a video-edge detector and by fluorescence analysis, respectively. In CHF control rats, the diastolic phase of cell shortening was prolonged compared with that of the sham-operated (sham) rats. This prolongation was prevented by treatment with MET-88 at 100 mg/kg or captopril at 20 mg/kg. CHF control rats also showed an increase in the decay time of [Ca2+]i transients compared with sham rats. MET-88 at 100 mg/kg and captopril at 20 mg/kg attenuated the increase in decay time of [Ca2+]i transients. Ca2+ uptake activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) isolated from the non-infarcted region in the left ventricle was measured, and Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis of the activity was performed. CHF control rats revealed a decrease in the Vmax for SR Ca2+ uptake activity without alteration in Kd. MET-88 at 100 mg/kg significantly prevented the decrease in Vmax, but had no effect on Kd. Also, treatment with MET-88 at 100 mg/kg improved myocardial high-energy phosphate levels impaired in CHF rats. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which MET-88 improved cardiac relaxation in CHF rats is based on the amelioration of [Ca2+]i transients through increase of SR Ca2+ uptake activity.",

We investigated the effect of short-term simvastatin administration on NO-mediated regulation of myocardial oxygen consumption (MV(O2)) in tissue from rat hearts. Male Wistar rats were divided into (a) control group (n = 14), and (b) simvastatin group (n = 10, 20 mg/kg/day by oral gavage). After 2 weeks, left ventricular myocardium was isolated to measure MV(O2) using a Clark-type oxygen electrode, and aortic plasma nitrates and nitrites (NOx) were measured. Baseline plasma NOx levels (19+/-2.6 in control vs. 20+/-2.5 microM/L in simvastatin) and baseline MV(O2) (288+/-23 in control vs. 252+/-11 nmol/g/min; p = 0.09) were not significantly different between the two groups. NO-dependent regulation of MV(O2) in response to bradykinin, ramipril, or amlodipine was augmented in simvastatin rats compared with controls (p < 0.05). Decrease of MV(O2) from baseline in response to highest doses in control versus simvastatin groups was as follows-bradykinin, -28+/-5% vs. -44+/-6%; ramipril, -35+/-5% vs. -50+/-8%; and amlodipine, -32+/-9% vs. -42+/-3%. Response to highest dose of NO donor S-nitroso N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) was not significantly different in the two groups (-55+/-5% vs. -52+/-7%). Treatment with Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, inhibitor of NO synthesis, attenuated the effect of bradykinin, ramipril, and amlodipine on MV(O2) (p < 0.05). In conclusion, short-term administration of simvastatin in rats potentiates the ability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and amlodipine to cause NO-mediated regulation of MV(O2).", 
    "372": "We have studied the effects of various angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on intraocular pressure (IOP) of rabbits with experimentally induced ocular hypertension and their mechanism of action. Acute ocular hypertension was induced by infusion of 5% glucose (15 ml/kg) through marginal ear vein, whereas chronic glaucoma was induced by injection of alpha-chymotrypsin into the posterior chamber of the eye. IOP was measured by tonometer. All ACE inhibitors were instilled topically in the eye in a sterile solution. The effect of ACE inhibitors also was studied on serum cholinesterase (true and pseudo) and the enzyme ACE in vitro. Enalaprilat, ramiprilat, and fosinopril produced a time-dependent decrease of IOP in both acute and chronic models of ocular hypertension in rabbits. The decrease in IOP was observed for >4 h, and the extent of decrease was comparable to that with both pilocarpine and betaxolol. Prodrugs enalapril and ramipril failed to produced any change in IOP. Losartan also produced a significant decrease in IOP in the chronic model of ocular hypertension in rabbits. All the three ACE inhibitors were found to inhibit ACE activity in aqueous humor. The enzyme cholinesterase was found to be inhibited by enalaprilat, ramiprilat, and fosinopril. However, atropine did not alter the IOP-lowering effect of enalaprilat in rabbits. Indomethacin pretreatment produced slight but significant inhibition of the IOP-lowering effect of enalaprilat in rabbits. Our data suggest that ACE inhibitors enalaprilat, ramiprilat, and fosinopril produce a significant ocular hypotensive effect in acute and chronic models of ocular hypertension in rabbits. Inhibition of ACE in aqueous humor, and in ocular tissues, resulting in reduced angiotensin II formation, could be one of the major mechanisms responsible for the IOP reduction by ACE inhibitors in rabbits.",

However, this form of dementia is relatively uncommon and the influence of blood pressure on the risk of other subtypes of vascular dementia remains to be clarified. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that vascular risk factors could also play a part in Alzheimer's disease. One of the aims of Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) is to test the hypothesis that blood pressure decreasing treatment based on perindopril would reduce the incidence of dementia among patients with cerebrovascular disease. The dementia procedures in PROGRESS involve a classical two-phase design, with an initial screening phase based mainly on the Mini-Mental State Examination - a simple, brief, and widely used screening test for dementia. The second phase involves a diagnostic assessment for dementia in individuals screened as positive according to the criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed.). In this project, two other domains of the relationship between vascular risk factors and cognition are being explored in relation to PROGRESS substudies. The apolipoprotein E polymorphism, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, is being determined in each patient, as part of the genetic substudy. This will allow study of the relationship between this polymorphism and blood pressure, and of the effect of blood pressure decreasing treatment on the risk of dementia. The magnetic resistance imaging substudy will improve understanding of the relationship between blood pressure decreasing and the occurrence of cerebral white matter lesions, which are known to be related to cognitive decline and dementia.",

    "384": "Chronic hypertension profoundly alters the function and structure of cerebral blood vessels. Cerebral arterioles undergo remodelling, with a reduction in external diameter and hypertrophy of the vessel wall and a paradoxical increase in distensibility. The primary aim of this review is to consider recent findings in relation to determinants of remodelling, hypertrophy, and altered distensibility and composition of cerebral blood vessels during chronic hypertension, with an emphasis on the renin-angiotensin system. In particular, we highlight studies designed to examine the hypothesis that the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on cerebral vascular structure in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (spSHR) may be independent of their effects on reductions in arterial pressure. For example, treatment of spSHR with the ACE inhibitor perindopril attenuates remodelling of cerebral arterioles, even when given in a low dose that only partially normalizes systemic arterial pressure and does not prevent hypertrophy. In contrast, treatment of spSHR with propranolol does not prevent cerebral arteriolar remodelling, even when given in a dose that produces a larger decrease in blood pressure than is achieved with the low dose of perindopril. Results such as these suggest that remodelling of cerebral arterioles during chronic hypertension may be independent of increases in arterial pressure, and instead may depend primarily on increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Evidence is also reviewed that suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may not contribute significantly to hypertrophy of cerebral arterioles during chronic hypertension. Rather, hypertrophy appears to depend in large part on increases in arterial pressure and, in particular, its pulsatile component.",

Within the group referred to the GPs, 62% of the patients had a follow-up visit within 3 months after discharge while 49% had visited the hospital outpatient clinic. The 1-year mortality rate was high, 30%.", 
    "413": "Patients admitted with heart failure in Sweden are old and carry a poor prognosis. In spite of the poor prognosis, only approximately half of the patients are followed-up within 3 months after discharge. There is, in contrast to practice guidelines, an underuse of diagnostic tests of left ventricular function and medical treatment is often suboptimal. These unsatisfactory findings were more pronounced in women.", 
    "414": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in heart failure. One therapeutic mechanism is believed to be the reduction of circulating angiotensin II and aldosterone. However, the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone axis (RAAS) is not uniformly suppressed during therapy for heart failure. This effect has been referred to as 'angiotensin II reactivation' and 'aldosterone escape' and their reactivation may herald clinical deterioration. In the CONSENSUS I trial, correlations were seen between mortality, and angiotensin II and aldosterone. Furthermore, mortality was lower in those with good angiotensin II suppression. Therefore, neurohormonal elevation despite adequate treatment may associate with a poorer prognosis.", 
    "415": "To follow chronic heart failure patients on ACE inhibitors for 18 months to assess whether or not angiotensin II and aldosterone reactivation are progressive with time, whether reactivation of both occurs simultaneously, and whether different ACE inhibitors have different neurohormonal profiles.", 
    "416": "We studied 22 patients (M/F 19:3, 72.5+/-7 years) on stable ACE inhibitors. Five times, in 18 months, samples were taken for neurohormones and ACE activity. Mean levels of neurohormones were remarkably stable over time, although captopril takers had generally higher angiotensin II, but lower aldosterone and renin. Aldosterone 'escape' (> 80 pg/ml) occurred in 13/97 samples (13.5%), in 5/22 (23%) individuals. Angiotensin II was elevated > or =10 pg/ml in 8/102 samples (8%), in 6/22 (27%) individuals. Four subjects had isolated angiotensin II reactivation, and three had aldosterone escape alone. On regression analyses between neurohormones in captopril takers there were significant correlations between; renin and angiotensin II (r = 0.62; P<0.02); angiotensin II and aldosterone (r = 0.6; P<0.02); and renin and aldosterone (r = 0.92; P<0.00001).", 
    "417": "In stable heart failure patients un-suppressed levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone occur despite therapy, but they are not necessarily progressive, nor simultaneous. Furthermore, contemporaneous serum ACE activity makes it unlikely the data presented reflects poor compliance. The results suggest that captopril takers may have different neurohormonal profiles, i.e. higher angiotensin II, and also better correlations between RAAS components, compared to longer acting preparations, although the numbers are small. Our data supports that of Swedberg et al. who showed reductions in both aldosterone and angiotensin II due to ACE inhibitor therapy, but no correlation between ACE activity and angiotensin II and only a limited correlation (r = 0.37) between angiotensin II and aldosterone. This suggests that the interaction between the components of the renin-angiotensin system is not simple and linear. The fact that each phenomenon appears to occur in isolation means that neurohormonal monitoring of individual could provide useful information to direct additional therapy. The RALES study has demonstrated reduced mortality from the addition of spironolactone to an ACE inhibitor emphasising the benefit of enhanced suppression of aldosterone in heart failure. Captopril may be less effective at suppressing the RAAS due to its short duration of action which would logically be associated with a more fluctuating pattern of ACE inhibition. In the presence of high levels of renin and angiotensin I even small differences in ACE activity will produce large variations in angiotensin II levels. Further studies should be directed at understanding the different mechanisms behind angiotensin II and aldosterone generation during ACE inhibition.",

The blood pressure reduction was sustained with losartan at 12 and 24 weeks. Systemic vascular resistance fell acutely after captopril (-16.4%, P = 0.01). Captopril caused an acute and sustained rise in superior mesenteric artery blood flow (+ 22.9%, P = 0.04), and a slower rise in renal artery blood flow (+31.7%, P = 0.01). Losartan had no acute effects on regional haemodynamics but had increased superior mesenteric artery blood flow by 38.1% at 12 weeks (P = 0.02).

However, it have been less discussed which drugs are suitable for the different stages of progressive renal failure. The present study examined the effects of timing of antihypertensive therapy using calcium channel blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in 5/6 nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Forty male 6 week old SHRs were divided into 5 groups (n=8 in each group), and they were placed on a high salt diet after 5/6 nephrectomy. Group 1, high salt diet without any drug. Group 2 received 0.2 mg/kg/day of amlodipine and group 3 received 0.2 mg/kg/day of enalapril mixed in the high salt diet from week 6 respectively. Similarly group 4 received the same doses of amlodipine, and group 5 received the same doses of enalapril from week 10. Each drug protected from increasing blood pressure in 4 groups, and no significant difference was observed between the effects of amlodipine and enalapril. Proteinuria was reduced with both drugs. In histopathological evaluation, glomerulosclerosis was controlled only in group 2, and arterio/olosclerosis was significantly suppressed in all treated groups except group 5. From these results, both amlodipine and enalapril are renal protective in early stage of renal failure with hypertension. However, in advanced stage of renal failure, amlodipine is superior in its renal protective effect.",

The possibility of predicting the efficacy of cilazapril based on evaluation of biochemical and genetic markers of the renin-angiotensin system was examined. Before cilazapril therapy, LV diastolic function and carotid artery distensibility were significantly impaired in 32 patients with residual LV hypertrophy compared with patients without LV hypertrophy. Cilazapril improved the LV mass in these patients with LV hypertrophy and improved LV diastolic function in a subset of 20 patients with elevated plasma renin activity. Patients with residual LV hypertrophy accompanied by cardiovascular functional abnormalities. Subsequent treatment with cilazapril significantly improved LV morphology and function in those with residual LV hypertrophy or elevated plasma renin activity.", 
    "425": "The circulating levels of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) are linked with a 287-base pair insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism at intron 16 of the ACE gene. Thus, the homozygous deletion (D/D genotype) could cause chronic vasoconstriction, arterial hypertension and, possibly, coronary artery disease. Also, the increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level and impaired fibrinolysis were related with the D/D genotype. The D allele has been recently associated with venous thrombosis among African-American men as well as among patients that underwent elective total hip replacement. We assess the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) linked with each genotype of the I/D ACE gene polymorphism in a Caucasian population by means of a case-control study. We genotyped the ACE gene in a series of 148 patients aged 45.0 +/- 16.0 years (range, 11-80 years), objectively diagnosed in our centre of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and in 240 thrombosis-free subjects (25-75 years) from the same geographic area. The observed difference in D allele frequencies between patients (0.56) and controls (0.62) was nonsignificant overall; however, statistical significance (P = 0.05) was found by considering the recessive hypothesis (D/D versus I/ D + I/I) [odds ratio (OR) = 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI95) = 0.42-0.99]. The OR was 0.88 (CI95 = 0.51-1.53; P = 0.65) for the dominant hypothesis (D/D + I/D versus I/I genotypes). The relative risk for the D allele was close to 1 for the dominant hypothesis, both considering gender and recurrent tendency; however, it was protective in men regarding the recessive hypothesis (OR = 0.53, CI95 = 0.29-0.97, P = 0.04). The I/D ACE allele distribution was similar among the 46 thrombophilic patients (antithrombin, protein C or protein S deficiencies, factor V R506Q, factor II G20210A or lupus anticoagulant). In conclusion, among (Spanish) Caucasians, this study does not support the hypothesis that the deletion allele (D) of the ACE gene could be a significant risk factor for VTE, being protective in men.", 
    "426": "Serial echocardiographic investigations were carried out on patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, to evaluate treatment effects on left ventricular (LV) performance during therapy with either metoprolol or captopril. Thirty-two patients (23 males and 9 females) with mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure (NYHA II-III) and a mean age of 49 years were included in the investigation. The patients were investigated with Doppler echocardiography before treatment, after 3 and 6 months of treatment (either metoprolol or captopril) and 1 month after withdrawal of treatment. Intra- and inter-investigator reproducibility was acceptable, with a coefficient of variation of less than 5% for LV dimensions. A reduction in LV dimensions was seen in both treatment groups. In the metoprolol group there was also an increase in LV stroke volume and fractional shortening. The non-invasive data were in accordance with invasive measurements of stroke volume and LV filling pressure. In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure, echocardiography seemed to be sufficiently reproducible to be used for determination of treatment effects in a longitudinal heart failure study. Both metoprolol and captopril were well tolerated and had favourable effects on LV performance.", 
    "427": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS\": Heart failure is common and effective therapy exists but as yet there is little evidence that the overall prognosis is improving in clinical practice. We sought to determine if mortality, re-admission with heart failure and re-admission for any cause, had changed between cohorts of first-time admissions for heart failure identified in 1984, 1988 and 1992 using linked hospital discharge and mortality data from Scotland (population approximately 5 million).", 
    "428": "The number of first-time admissions for heart failure increased by 30% between 1984 and 1992, from 9716 to 12640. Their mean age was 74 years and 54% were women. Over the same period 3-year mortality declined in patients < 65 years from 53 to 41% (reduction in risk 12% (95% confidence interval 9-15%. Log-rank 70.0; P<0.001) and for patients > or =65 years from 71% to 66% (reduction in risk 5% (95% confidence interval 3-6%. Log-rank 74.5; P<0.0001). Time to death or first re-admission with heart failure also improved but not time to death or first re-admission for any cause. The total number of re-admissions increased between 1984 and 1992 but bed-days occupancy for heart failure and for any cause, adjusted for days alive, declined due to a reduction in length of stay.",

Sub-studies of this trial include a 6-min walking test and more detailed evaluation of ventricular function (as assessed by echocardiography). Both parameters will be measured at 8 weeks and 1 year, and analysed against baseline data. Cognitive function in this group of patients will also be evaluated at baseline and 1 year.

    "434": "To investigate mechanisms by which angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibition increases insulin sensitivity, spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats were treated with or without ramipril (1 mg/kg per day) for 12 weeks. Insulin binding and protein levels of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), p85-subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (p85) and Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) were then determined in hindlimb muscle and liver. Additionally, protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activities towards immobilized phosphorylated insulin receptor or phosphorylated IRS-1 of membrane (MF) and cytosolic fractions (CF) of these tissues were measured. Ramipril treatment increased IRS-1-protein content in muscle by 31+/-9% (P<0.05). No effects were observed on IRS-1 content in liver or on insulin binding or protein expression of p85 or SHP2 in both tissues. Ramipril treatment also increased dephosphorylation of insulin receptor by muscle CF (22.0+/-1.0%/60 min compared to 16.8+/-1.5%/60 min; P<0.05), and of IRS-1 by liver MF (37.2+/-1.7%/7.5 min compared to 33.8+/-1.7%/7.5 min; P<0.05) and CF (36.8+/-1.0%/7.5 min compared to 33.2+/-1.0%/7.5 min; P<0.05). We conclude that the observed effects of ACE-inhibition by ramipril on the protein expression of IRS-1 and on PTPase activity might contribute to its effect on insulin sensitivity.", 
    "435": "In hypercholesterolemia in the presence or absence of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular dysfunction and altered signaling of angiotensin, nitric oxide, or prostanoids are closely related to enhanced oxidant stress. We analyzed the potentially beneficial effects of the specific angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the specific angiotensin receptor blocker losartan on cardiac performance, eicosanoid metabolism, and parameters of oxidant stress in hypercholesterolemic animals. Guinea pigs were fed a 1% cholesterol diet for 8 weeks (Chol) with or without equieffective doses of either enalapril (1.5 mg/kg/d; Ena) or losartan (3 mg/kg/d; Los). Hemodynamics were analyzed in Langendorff hearts. Detection of eicosanoids was by enzyme immunoassay. Estimation of plasma xanthine oxidase (XO) activity was determined by spectrophotometry. In hypercholesterolemic guinea pigs, enhanced oxidant stress (e.g., increased plasma XO activities) was associated with profound myocardial and coronary (e.g., endothelial) dysfunction. Both enalapril and losartan lowered plasma cholesterol levels slightly, but only the angiotensin receptor antagonist effectively suppressed the increased plasma XO activities (from 11.4 +/- 0.7 to 7.6 +/- 2.2 U/L), and at the same time decreased the augmented coronary flow (from 26.0 +/- 1.0 to 23.0 +/- 1.0 mL/min/g tissue) observed in hypercholesterolemic animals. Assessment of left ventricular pressure and contractility (e.g., dp/dtmax) as well as the diastolic relaxation parameter (tau) revealed substantial myocardial dysfunction (systolic and diastolic) in Chol that was more substantially (and comparably) improved during administration of losartan (Los) than during enalapril (Ena). Surprisingly, angiotensin signaling blockade by either antagonist further suppressed the diminished coronary dilator responses to bradykinin (BK; not significant for enalapril) or adenosine (Ado) was demonstrated in Chol Langendorff hearts [delta CPPBK/Ado: from 5.0 +/- 0.5/0.9 +/- 0.1 to 4.4 +/- 1.5/0.4 +/- 0.1 (Ena) or to 1.9 +/- 0.5/0.4 +/- 0.1 (Los) cm2 (area under the curve), respectively]. Finally, as expected from control studies using heart preparations from normocholesterolemic guinea pigs, enhanced cardiac release of eicosanoids, prostacyclin, and thromboxane in Chol (0.48 +/- 0.03 and 0.6 +/- 0.1 ng/min/g) was augmented even further by treatment with enalapril (Ena: 1.6 +/- 0.4 and 1.0 +/- 0.1 ng/min/g), but was significantly reduced to or below control levels in losartan-treated animals (Los: 0.4 +/- 0.1 and 0.2 +/- 0.1 ng/min/g). Blockade of angiotensin signaling via angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or receptor antagonism--although differentially acting on enhanced cardiac prostanoid metabolism and oxidant stress--efficiently restored proper systolic and diastolic myocardial performance (losartan was more beneficial than enalapril), probably by counterbalancing altered angiotensin II-->angiotensin receptor signaling in the cardiovascular system of hypercholesterolemic animals. Impaired coronary vasodilator capacity seems to be irreversible after 8 weeks of a high-cholesterol diet, as shown by the unexpected lack of a dilator effect with both enalapril and losartan.", 
    "436": "The new guidelines for blood pressure control recommended by the World Health Organisation, the International Society of Hypertension, and the JNC VI require that blood pressure be lowered to levels of < 130/85 mmHg in persons with either diabetes or renal insufficiency. A review of over 20 clinical trials performed over the last two decades indicates that an average of 62% of the participants required more than two medications to achieve a goal of < 140/90 mmHg. Thus, with the new guidelines it is clear that an even higher proportion of people will require at least two different medications to achieve this lower goal. Certain classes of antihypertensive medications are relatively more efficacious for lowering blood pressure in certain ethnic and racial groups, thus reducing the probability that two or more agents will be needed to achieve a stated blood pressure goal. This is exemplified by the effects of calcium channel blockers in African-Americans. However, even in these groups many require at least two different antihypertensive agents to achieve the blood pressure goal. The fixed-dose combinations of a calcium channel blocker and ACE inhibitor offer the advantages of complementary physiologic action, improved tolerability, lower side-effect profile, enhanced salutary effects on target organs, better compliance, and lower cost. Varieties of fixed-dose combination regimens for blood pressure lowering are available for clinical use. This article focuses on the subclasses of calcium channel blockers and their role in altering the natural history of both cardiovascular and renal disease. The article further discusses the role of fixed-dose agents with regard to their place in the antihypertensive armamentarium.", 
    "437": "Left ventricle systolic dysfunction and congestive heart failure after AMI are still a great problem in cardiology. Introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after AMI has been a new step in therapy of the left ventricle systolic disfunction. Some long term studies have proved influence of ACE inhibitors on reduction of mortality, severe congestive heart failure (CHF), and reinfarction. The importance of administration of a remedy once daily has been emphasized, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of trandolapril in the left ventricle dysfunction and CHF has been described. TRACE study proved influence of long-term once daily administration of trandolapril on significant reduction of total and cardiovascular mortality, reduction of sudden death, reduction of severe and resistant CHF and reduction or relay of reinfarction. A good risk/benefit ratio has been found.", 
    "438": "The powder characteristics and the effect of the molecular weight of polymers as diluents on the release rate of furosemide and captopril from hard gelatin capsules were evaluated. The high molecular weight polymers studied were poly(oxyethylene) homopolymers (Polyox), with molecular weight ranging from 4,000,000 to 7,000,000. Powder characteristics suggested good flowability for these materials and predicted capsule fill weight uniformity. Swelling experiments showed a very high degree of swelling for these materials in both gastric and buffer solution. These polymers can sustain the release rate of both water-soluble and insoluble drugs from drug delivery systems. The low molecular weight polymers have a less pronounced sustained-release effect compared to the high molecular weight polymer material (i.e., those with 7,000,000 molecular weight). An increase in the content of polymer results in a decrease in the release rate of the drug. The solubility of the drugs clearly influenced the release rate. Release kinetics were evaluated and appeared to be influenced by the molecular weight of the polymer, the solubility of drug, and the ratio of the drug to polymer in the capsule. Bimodal release kinetics were exhibited by a number of furosemide formulations (i.e., F5 and F8).", 
    "439": "For people with chronic renal insufficiency, the therapeutic goal is to prevent progression to end-stage renal disease, a serious condition that can only be treated with dialysis and kidney transplantation. Although restriction of dietary protein slows the progression of renal disease somewhat, the principal treatment to slow chronic renal disease is appropriate reduction of blood pressure. Antihypertensive agents, particularly those that produce sustained, long-term reductions in proteinuria, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, not only decrease blood pressure but also preserve renal function. Clinical trials to evaluate these and other drug therapies in renal disease progression have used both \"hard end points\" (e.g., dialysis, transplantation, death) and intermediate end points of renal disease progression (e.g., doubling of serum creatinine concentration, reductions in proteinuria). Trials that have used hard end points typically recruited patients with advanced renal disease to demonstrate a difference in therapies within a period of 2 to 5 years. However, proteinuria reduction, along with a decrease in the time to doubling of serum creatinine in very early diabetic renal disease, could demonstrate an altered natural history of renal disease. Although hard end points are indicators of a drug's efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events or preserving renal function, they do not assess the impact of a treatment on altering the natural history of early renal disease. For clinical trials of people with all but the most advanced renal disease, use of intermediate end points of renal disease progression is the only practical option for assessment of treatment efficacy and effectiveness. Given the available data on proteinuria reduction and doubling of serum creatinine from clinical trials, these end points, taken together, appear to provide an acceptable means of assessing a treatment's impact on slowing renal disease progression.", 
    "440": "Based on the reduction of ischemic cardiac events in clinical trials and experimental observations, inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II on coronary microcirculatory function may afford myocardial protection after injury. The immediate effects of intracoronary AT1 receptor blockade with irbesartan were examined in a pig model in the healthy myocardium and in acute ischemia induced by injection of 30-microm microspheres into the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Electron-beam computed tomography was performed for in-vivo quantitative measurements of regional intramyocardial vascular blood volume (V(B)) and perfusion (F(M)), as well as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and muscle mass. Ratios of V(B) and F(M) in the anterior (LAD-supplied)/ inferior (control) myocardium were generated. At baseline, 0.2 mg/kg irbesartan injected into the LAD increased V(B) and F(M) ratios significantly by 27 +/- 8% and 51 +/- 13%, respectively. After anterior coronary microembolization, V(B) and F(M) ratios were 0.60 +/- 0.05 and 0.51 +/- 0.05, respectively, and were significantly increased by irbesartan (by 24 +/- 10% and by 36 +/- 11%, respectively). After 4 weeks of treatment with oral irbesartan (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7), an improved LVEF (56 +/- 4% v 44 +/- 4%, P = .046) was observed in irbesartan-treated animals, but no difference in LV end-diastolic volumes or muscle mass. Resting V(B) (0.95 +/- 0.06 v 0.76 +/- 0.06; P = .047) and F(M) (0.84 +/- 0.05 v 0.64 +/- 0.04; P = .016) ratios were significantly greater in irbesartan-treated animals. Using adenosine, there was a trend for higher V(B) and F(M) ratios in irbesartan- v placebo-treated animals. Therefore, in a pig model of acute myocardial ischemia, AT1 receptor blockade by irbesartan induced microvascular vasodilation and, ostensibly, conveyed myocardial protection. Long-term treatment with irbesartan resulted in moderate enhancements of resting V(B) and F(M) compared with placebo, suggesting a role for coronary microcirculatory effects of chronic AT1 receptor blockade in preserving LVEF.", 
    "441": "This self-matched control study aimed to compare the efficiency of two different regimens of active treatment: aspirin in low (100 mg daily) versus intermediate (500 mg daily) doses in abolishing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced cough. A dry bothersome cough is the most common adverse class effect of all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Prostaglandins (PG) have been pinpointed as playing a leading role in the genesis of ACEI-associated cough. The role of different doses of the most commonly used PG inhibitor-aspirin-in ACEI cough modification was not yet elucidated. Of 350 consecutive ACEI-treated patients, we identified 34 (9.7%) nonsmoking ACEI-related coughers. Patients with lung disease, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment, and those who did not agree to participate in the study were excluded. In the remaining 14 ACEI coughers (eight men, six women; mean age, 63 +/- 11 years), the treatment was discontinued; the dry cough completely disappeared, but returned in all patients within 1 week after ACEI reintroduction. At the end of the rechallenge period, patients started a low dose of aspirin for 1 week, switching thereafter to the intermediate dose of aspirin for an additional week. On each visit the cough severity (CS, 0-4) and frequency (CF, 0-10) scores were registered. Low doses of aspirin were ineffective in suppressing ACEI-induced cough, whereas intermediate doses completely abolished cough in five patients and reduced coughing in all but one patient; CS and CF decreased, respectively, from 2.5 +/- 1.0 to 0.9 +/- 1.1, P < .002 and from 6.6 +/- 2.4 to 2.4 +/- 1.1, P < .0002. Overall, intermediate doses of aspirin beneficially modified cough scores in 13 (93%) patients, enabling nine (64%) to continue ACEI treatment. Aspirin did not influence blood pressure control either in hypertensives or in postinfarction patients. We conclude that intermediate but not low doses of aspirin probably can suppress ACEI-induced cough. These findings propose a new alternative therapeutic approach for patients with ACEI-related cough, especially those in whom ACEI treatment seems to be essential.", 
    "442": "An indirect method is described for the determination of captopril (KPL) in pharmaceutical preparations by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The procedure is based on the complexation of KPL with an excess of Pd(II) ion. The unreacted Pd(II) was resoluted on a cationic ion-exchanger resin, while Pd(II)-KPL sequestrate was not retained. The effluent Pd(II) sequestrade was measured by AAS. The absorbance is found to increase linearly with increasing KPL concentration, because the amount of Pd(II) is related to the concentration of KPL, which is corroborate by the calculated correlation coefficient value of 0.9939. The system obeys Beer's law for 1-40 microg ml(-1), S.D. was found to be 0.039 (n = 5). The Pd(II)-KPL complex was obtained in the solid phase.

The survival time was significantly shortened (15.6+/-0.3 weeks) in the IGF-1 group but significantly prolonged (19.5+/-0.6 weeks) in the temocapril group. The rats in the IGF-1 group showed accelerated LV dilation and dysfunction. Of the several parameters investigated, it was found that the relative amounts of MHC isoforms differed among the three groups. The alpha-MHC mRNA level was decreased by 52% (p<0.01) in the IGF group, while it increased by 58% (p<0.01) in the temocapril group compared with the control group. These changes were related to the progression of LV dysfunction.",

Our data suggest that IGF-1 may not protect myocardial performance when its hypertrophic effect aggravates the reduction of alpha-MHC. By contrast, the ACE inhibitor may improve myocardial function and prognosis by preventing the down-regulation of this isoform.", 
    "448": "The object of the study was to assess the relationship between erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and inflammatory cytokine production in chronic heart failure (CHF). Our findings lead us to re-evaluate the prognostic value of the ESR in assessing patients with CHF.", 
    "449": "The search for simple prognostic markers in CHF that can be assessed anywhere at low cost is important. Increases in ESR are related to the acute phase response in states of inflammation and infection.", 
    "450": "Initially, we studied ESR in relation to plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines in 58 CHF patients. The findings prompted us to analyze the mortality predictive power of ESR compared with established risk factors in these patients and (retrospectively) in a second group of 101 clinically stable CHF patients who had ESR measured.", 
    "451": "In all 159 CHF patients (age 62+/-2 years, New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 2.7+/-0.1), ESR ranged from 1 to 96 mm/h (median 14 mm/h). The ESR was correlated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (r = 0.31, p<0.05), soluble TNF receptor-1 (r = 0.48, p<0.0005), soluble TNF receptor-2 (r = 0.39, p<0.005) and interleukin 6 (r = 0.45, p<0.005) levels. High ESR levels indicated a poor prognosis (p<0.0001), and this was independent of age, NYHA class, ejection fraction and peak oxygen consumption (p < 0.005). Patients with ESR above median (> or =15 mm/h) compared with patients with ESR <15 mm/h had an impaired survival (hazard ratio 2.62, 95% confidence interval 1.58-4.36, p<0.0001).", 
    "452": "Our study demonstrates that in CHF a high ESR is an unfavorable prognostic sign, independent of patients' symptomatology and ventricular function. These results are in diametrical contrast to previous results. This may reflect a change in the underlying pathophysiology due to today's treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "453": "We sought to test the hypothesis that plasma volume (PV) expansion in heart transplant recipients (HTRs) is caused by failure to reflexively suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) axis.",

    "455": "Plasma volume and fluid regulatory hormones were measured in eight HTRs (57+/-6 years old) both before and after treatment with captopril (225 mg/day). Antihypertensive and diuretic agents were discontinued 10 days before. The HTRs were admitted to the Clinical Research Center (CRC), and, after three days of a constant diet containing 87 mEq/day of Na+, PV was measured by using the modified Evans blue dye dilution technique. After approximately four months (16+/-5 weeks), the same HTRs again discontinued all antihypertensive and diuretic agents; they were progressed to a captopril dose of 75 mg three times per day over 14 days, and the CRC protocol was repeated.", 
    "456": "Captopril pharmacologically suppressed (p<0.05) supine rest levels of angiotensin II (-65%) and aldosterone (-75%). The reductions in vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide levels after captopril did not reach statistical significance. The PV, normalized for body weight (ml/kg), was significantly reduced by 12% when the HTRs received captopril.", 
    "457": "Extracellular fluid volume is expanded (12%) in clinically stable HTRs who become hypertensive. Pharmacologic suppression of the RAA axis with high-dose captopril (225 mg/day) returned HTRs to a normovolemic state. These findings indicate that fluid retention is partly engendered by a failure to reflexively suppress the RAA axis when HTRs become hypervolemic.",

    "460": "Forty-eight patients in New York Heart Association functional class II or III, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)< or =40% and in sinus rhythm were randomized to a dose-ranging pilot study of omapatrilat for 12 weeks. Measurements were performed at baseline and 12 weeks.", 
    "461": "There was an improvement in functional status, as reported by the patient (p<0.001) and physician (p<0.001) at 12 weeks. Dose-dependent improvements in LVEF (p<0.001) and LV end-systolic wall stress (sigma) (p<0.05) were seen, together with a reduction in systolic blood pressure (p<0.05). There was evidence of a natriuretic effect (p<0.001), and total blood volume decreased (p<0.05). Omapatrilat induced an increase in postdose plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels (p<0.01) in the high dose groups, with a reduction in predose plasma brain natriuretic peptide (p<0.001) and epinephrine (p<0.01) levels after 12 weeks of therapy. Omapatrilat was well tolerated.",

    "464": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of coronary events in various patient groups and to prevent the development of atherosclerosis in animal models. It has been hypothesized that the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors may, therefore, be mediated by effects on atherosclerosis.", 
    "465": "Six hundred seventeen patients were randomized in equal proportions to ramipril (5-10 mg daily) or placebo. At baseline, two years and four years, carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode ultrasound, and left ventricular mass was assessed by M-mode echocardiography.", 
    "466": "Blood pressure (BP) was reduced by a mean of 6 mm Hg systolic and 4 mm Hg diastolic in the ramipril group compared with the placebo group (p<0.001). There was no difference between groups in the changes in common carotid artery wall thickness (p = 0.58) or in carotid plaque (p = 0.93). Left ventricular mass index decreased by 3.8 g/m2 (4%) in the ramipril group compared with the placebo group (2p = 0.04).", 
    "467": "The results provide no support for the hypothesis that reduced atherosclerosis is responsible for the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on major coronary events. It is more likely that the benefits are due to lower BP, reduced left ventricular mass or other factors such as reversal of endothelial dysfunction.",

    "471": "More vigorous control of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and other risk factors may be of crucial importance for risk reduction. Despite remarkable progress in recent years, the choice of a coronary revascularization strategy remains a challenge in these patients. Diabetic patients with CAD are predisposed to higher cardiovascular events after balloon angioplasty. Whether stenting and new antiplatelet drugs improve the results of percutaneous revascularization in this population needs further evaluation. The superiority of the surgical approach is also not definitely established. Therefore, many aspects of coronary revascularization are still unclear in these patients.", 
    "472": "The results of ongoing randomized trials comparing multiple coronary stents to bypass surgery will likely provide some answers to our questions and additional randomized trials evaluating intensive diabetic control with or without coronary revascularization are needed to determine the best therapeutic approach in these patients.",

The global tests of Hung, Chi and Lipicky are extended for analysis of unbalanced factorial design trials to test the hypothesis that at least one of the non-zero dose combinations of two drugs is more effective than the respective component doses. When the dose combinations have heterogeneous effect sizes, an unbalanced design may induce greater power than the balanced design. An adjusted p-value approach is proposed for testing the individual dose combinations under the condition that the maximum type I error probability is protected.",

Incubations were performed without or with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin (87 nM), or the selective MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059 (50 microM). ACE amount in intact endothelial cells was measured by an inhibitor binding assay and ACE mRNA levels by RNase protection assay.",

Local induction of ACE by OSM in the vascular wall may be a consequence of inflammatory processes leading to locally increased production of angiotensin II and breakdown of bradykinin.", 
    "478": "Congestive heart failure is a progressive disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the incidence and prevalence of congestive heart failure have increased in recent years. Contributing factors include increased survival in patients with coronary artery disease (especially myocardial infarction), an aging population and significant advances in the control of other potentially lethal diseases. New and existing agents, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers and, more recently, spironolactone, are being used increasingly to prolong life in patients with heart failure. Although digoxin has been used to treat heart failure for more than 200 years, its role in patients with congestive heart failure and sinus rhythm is still debatable. Over the past decade, digoxin has received renewed attention because of recognition of its neurohormonal effect and the successful use of lower dosages. In recent trials, digoxin has been shown to reduce morbidity associated with congestive heart failure but to have no demonstrable effect on survival. The goal of digoxin therapy in patients with congestive heart failure is to improve quality of life by reducing symptoms and preventing hospitalizations.",

    "480": "Sixteen patients(10 men and 6 women, mean age 59 +/- 13 years) with dilated cardiomyopathy underwent dobutamine gated blood pool scintigraphy to measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) using tracer at 0, 5, 10 and 15 micrograms/kg/min before treatment. Patients were divided into good responders (LVEF increase > or = 15%) 8 patients(GR Group) and poor responders(LVEF increase < 15%) 8 patients (PR Group) after treatment with beta-blocker or amiodarone with a background treatment of digitalis, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine(MIBG) imaging to evaluate cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and echocardiography were performed before and at one year after treatment. MIBG imaging was obtained 4 hours after tracer injection, and the heart/mediastinum count ratio(H/M ratio) calculated from the anterior planar image and the total defect score(TDS) from the single photon emission computed tomography image. LVEF and left ventricular endo-diastolic dimension (LVDd) were measured by echocardiography and New York Heart Association(NYHA) functional class was evaluated.", 
    "481": "The GR Group showed TDS decreased from 28 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 12(p < 0.05), H/M ratio increased from 1.79 +/- 0.26 to 2.07 +/- 0.32(p < 0.05), LVEF increased from 29 +/- 8% to 48 +/- 10%(p < 0.01), and LVDd decreased from 65 +/- 4 mm to 58 +/- 5 mm(p < 0.05). In contrast, the PR Group showed no significant changes in TDS, H/M ratio, LVEF and LVDd. NYHA functional class improved in both groups. The improvement was better in the GR Group than in the PR Group.",

    "483": "Sudden unexpected death frequently occurs in chronic heart failure. The importance of acute coronary events in triggering sudden death (SD) is unclear.", 
    "484": "We evaluated at autopsy the prevalence of acute coronary findings (coronary thrombus, ruptured plaque, or myocardial infarction [MI]) and their relation to SD. Autopsy results in 171 patients in the randomized ATLAS trial were reviewed. The prevalence of acute coronary findings was 33%: in 54% of patients with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) who died suddenly, 32% who died of myocardial failure, but in non-CAD patients, they were present in only 5% and 10% respectively. The percentage of patients classified as dying of MI was 28% in the autopsy group versus 4% in the nonautopsied group (P<0.0001). Of the autopsied group with acute MI, 97% (31 of 32 patients) with SD and 40% (6 of 15 patients) with myocardial failure did not have the MI diagnosed during life. When undiagnosed MI was classified as \"sudden unexpected\" or \"myocardial failure\" from clinical information only, the distribution of death causes was similar in the autopsy and nonautopsied groups.", 
    "485": "Acute coronary findings are frequent and usually not clinically diagnosed in heart failure patients with CAD, particularly in those dying suddenly, suggesting the importance of acute coronary events as a trigger for SD in this setting.", 
    "486": "It remains unknown whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition can prevent heart failure in rats with a fixed high pressure load of the left ventricle and if this effect could be attributed to normalization of contractile protein phenotype and cardiac collagen content. Rats with constriction of the ascending aorta were treated with the ACE inhibitor quinapril (6 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) (n=95) or placebo (n=96) (starting 6 weeks post surgery. Quinapril treatment improved survival markedly (P<0.0000001) during the 24 weeks observation period. There were 69 deaths with placebo and only 25 deaths with quinapril. At the end of the observation period signs of left ventricular backward failure were, however, detected in 75 rats with placebo and in 67 rats treated with quinapril (P=0.229). Cox proportional hazard model with time-dependent covariates was used to document that the effect of quinapril treatment had been dependent on time. Quinapril had no significant effect on the development of morphological signs of left ventricular dysfunction after the first 54 days of treatment. The increased isomysin V(3) proportion of hypertrophied non-failing hearts was also not affected by quinapril treatment. Irrespective of treatment, failing hypertrophied hearts were characterized by an increase in left ventricular volume (P<0.05), percentage of the 'foetal' isomyosin V(3) (P<0.05), and hydroxyproline concentration (P<0.05). While the cause of the improved survival remains unknown, quinapril did apparently not interfere with the restitution of 'foetal' gene expression of pressure overloaded cardiomyocytes leading to depressed myocardial performance, ventricular dysfunction and the consecutive myocardial fibrosis.", 
    "487": "Most chronic nephropathies are characterized by a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that may lead to renal function replacement by dialysis or transplant. Hypertension has an extremely important role among the various mechanisms contributing to renal function deterioration. High blood pressure levels are associated with increased urinary excretion of proteins and the decrease of systemic and glomerular hypertension reduces urinary excretion of proteins and preserves renal function deterioration. Moreover, recent studies found that an intensified blood pressure control (less than 130/80 mmHg) can slow the progression of diabetic and non diabetic renal disease even more than conventional blood pressure control. The Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy (REIN) Study showed that ramipril, an ACE-inhibitor, slowed the rate of GFR decline and halved the combined risk of doubling serum creatinine or end stage renal failure (ESRF) in patients with nephrotic range proteinuria as compared to conventional antihypertensive therapy, at comparable levels of blood pressure control. In these patients, prolonged enough treatment (at least 36 months) with ramipril, lowered the velocity of GFR decline and reduced the risk of dialysis. Thus, both tight blood pressure control and ACE-inhibitors may have a renoprotective effect. It will be interesting to evaluate whether the two combined approaches may have sinergistic effects.", 
    "488": "That systemic hypertension is involved in the progression of human renal disease is mostly suggested by the way anti-hypertensive treatment affects the course of the disease. Clinical evidence has been obtained from observational studies as well as from studies of dietary protein restriction. In addition, several trials have compared the effects of different antihypertensive agents. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have the best renoprotective effect when compared to conventional agents and calcium channel blockers. In most studies, ACE-inhibitors approximately halved the risk of progressive renal functional deterioration in patients with non-diabetic nephropathies; this protection was associated with a significant reduction in systemic blood pressure and proteinuria. Statistical analysis, however, also suggests a direct effect of ACE-inhibitors on the kidney.", 
    "489": "Primary care physician treatment practices affect the rate of hypertension control to the goal of 140/90 mm Hg. Awareness of and agreement with national hypertension management guidelines, and grounding in evidence-based medicine principles, may be important determinants of practice.", 
    "490": "A 26-item mail questionnaire was sent to a national sample of 1200 primary care physicians. The questionnaire elicited (1) the blood pressure (BP) criteria physicians use to initiate and intensify hypertension treatment, (2) first-line drug treatment choices, (3) familiarity with the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) hypertension treatment guidelines, and (4) familiarity with research methods used to develop evidence-based medicine guidelines. The analysis focused on (1) determining the percentage of physicians who reported treatment practices consistent with JNC recommendations and (2) the relation between familiarity with JNC guidelines, evidence-based medicine methods, and reported treatment practices.", 
    "491": "The overall response rate was 34%, with no important differences in demographic or professional training variables between respondents and nonrespondents. For middle-aged patients with uncomplicated hypertension, 33% of physicians would not start drug therapy unless the diastolic BP was greater than 95 mm Hg, and 43% would not start unless the systolic BP was greater than 160 mm Hg. In patients without complications who were receiving drug treatment, 25% of physicians would not intensify therapy for a persistent diastolic BP of 94 mm Hg, and 33% would not intensify therapy for a systolic BP of 158 mm Hg. Physicians were generally less aggressive in older patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most common first-line drug choice. Forty-one percent of physicians had not heard of or were not familiar with the JNC guidelines. In multiple logistic regression models, familiarity with the JNC guidelines was associated with lower treatment thresholds, and increased familiarity with research methods was associated with greater use of diuretics or beta-blockers as first-line agents.", 
    "492": "Many physicians have higher BP thresholds for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension than the 140/90 mm Hg criterion recommended by the JNC. Therefore, further improvements in population hypertension control will require physician behavior change. Physician practice is associated with awareness of practice guidelines and familiarity with evidence-based medicine methods, but the precise nature and extent of this relation requires further study.", 
    "493": "Our laboratory has demonstrated (Steen MS, Foianini KR, Youngblood EB, Kinnick TR, Jacob S, and Henriksen EJ, J Appl Physiol 86: 2044-2051, 1999) that exercise training and treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril interact to improve insulin action in insulin-resistant obese Zucker rats. The present study was undertaken to determine whether a similar interactive effect of these interventions is manifest in an animal model of normal insulin sensitivity. Lean Zucker (Fa/-) rats were assigned to either a sedentary, trandolapril-treated (1 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) for 6 wk), exercise-trained (treadmill running for 6 wk), or combined trandolapril-treated and exercise-trained group. Exercise training alone or in combination with trandolapril significantly (P < 0.05) increased peak oxygen consumption by 26-32%. Compared with sedentary controls, exercise training alone or in combination with ACE inhibitor caused smaller areas under the curve for glucose (27-37%) and insulin (41-44%) responses during an oral glucose tolerance test. Exercise training alone or in combination with trandolapril also improved insulin-stimulated glucose transport in isolated epitrochlearis (33-50%) and soleus (58-66%) muscles. The increases due to exercise training alone or in combination with trandolapril were associated with enhanced muscle GLUT-4 protein levels and total hexokinase activities. However, there was no interactive effect of exercise training and ACE inhibition observed on insulin action. These results indicate that, in rats with normal insulin sensitivity, exercise training improves oral glucose tolerance and insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport, whereas ACE inhibition has no effect. Moreover, the beneficial interactive effects of exercise training and ACE inhibition on these parameters are not apparent in lean Zucker rats and, therefore, are restricted to conditions of insulin resistance.", 
    "494": "Drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system have multiple mechanisms of action that may be beneficial in stabilizing or delaying progression of renal disease. The most important of these actions is the simultaneous control of both systemic and glomerular capillary hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a class of drugs that have proven antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects, with a demonstrated ability to delay progression of renal disease in conjunction with the ability to reduce systemic blood pressure. The mechanism of action for these drugs remains poorly described, but depends in part on an ability to reduce plasma angiotensin II levels and increase plasma bradykinin levels. Angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1) blockers differ in their mechanism of action from the ACE inhibitors. These drugs primarily block the binding of angiotensin II to its type 1 site. In so blocking the type 1 binding site, however, greater levels of circulating angiotensin II result, and the resultant biologic activity of angiotensin II or its metabolites such as angiotensin(1-7) and angiotensin(3-8) may be more directed to other angiotensin-binding sites. AT1 blockers have similar antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects to those of ACE inhibitors and they may prove to be as useful as ACE inhibitors in delaying progression of renal disease. Because ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers inhibit the renin-angiotensin system by different mechanisms, there is a possibility that combining them in clinical practice may prove efficacious for lowering blood pressure and for providing target organ protection.", 
    "495": "Over 1,600 plasmapheresis procedures have been performed by using secondary on-line membrane plasma filters in 62 patients over the past 12 years in our institution. The disease categories treated include cryoprotein induced diseases such as cryoglobulinemia, immune mediated disorders, and familial type II-A hypercholesterolemia (FHC). Depending upon the molecular size of the offending agent, we used plasma filters (PF) with different pore sizes ranging from 0.02 microm to 0.04 microm or the cryoglobulin filter (CF) with an average pore size of 4.3 microm to remove cryoprecipitable proteins. One plasma volume was processed in each treatment. The results of treating 25 patient in over 550 procedures by using PF show it is safe and effective in treating immune mediated disorders and FHC. PF selectively removes macromolecules according to pore size and are more specific for the treatment of immune mediated diseases and FHC than plasma exchange. The results of treating 37 patients in over 1,100 procedures by using CF show it is safe and effective in selectively removing cryoproteins, and it is very specific for the treatment of cryoprotein induced diseases. Both PF and CF are biocompatible, with no complement activation. Unlike plasma exchange, secondary membrane plasma filters do not cause deficiency syndromes and do not require albumin or fresh frozen plasma as replacement fluid, making them more cost effective than plasma exchange.", 
    "496": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients receiving dialysis. This is attributed in part to the shared risk factors of cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease. The risk factors for coronary artery disease include the classic cardiac risk factors of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking. Also in this population, hyperparathyroidism, hypoalbuminemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, elevated levels of apolipoprotein (a), and the type of dialysis membrane may play a role. Management begins with risk factor modification and medical therapy including aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents. Revascularization is often important, and coronary artery bypass grafting appears to be preferable to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. This is especially true for those with multivessel disease, impaired left ventricular function, severe symptoms, or ischemia. Congestive heart failure is another common problem in dialysis patients. The management includes correction of underlying abnormalities, optimal dialysis, and medical therapy. Data obtained from the general population indicate obvious benefits from ACE inhibitors and beta blockers, and these agents would be considered the therapies of choice. Erythropoetin is also an essential component of therapy, but the ideal hemoglobin concentration has yet to be determined. Peritoneal dialysis may be helpful in severe cases of heart failure. Pericarditis is seen in less than 10% of dialysis patients and is best diagnosed by clinical examination and echocardiography. Intensive dialysis is often the best initial therapy. Pericardiocentesis is reserved for the setting of pericardial tamponade, but a pericardial window is more definitive.", 
    "497": "By blocking the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and more recently introduced angiotensin II receptor antagonists are two important classes of antihypertensive drugs. Whether one class is superior to the other is presently unknown. Their antihypertensive efficacy is comparable. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are particularly well tolerated but the converting enzyme inhibitors have broader indications. The results of the large studies with morbidity and mortality end-points are awaited to better define the place of the angiotensin II antagonists in monotherapy and in combination.", 
    "498": "Using a number of agonist and antagonist compounds, we attempted to characterize the responses and receptors involved in the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the in situ blood perfused rat mesentery. An intra-arterial (i.a.) bolus injection of 5-HT increased mesenteric perfusion pressure in a dose-dependent way but did not change the systemic blood pressure. The selective 5-HT(2) receptor agonists alpha-methyl-5-HT, 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (m-CPP) and (+/-)-1-(4-iodo-2, 5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI), caused a local vasoconstrictor effect in the autoperfused vascular mesenteric bed. Intra-arterial injection of 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (m-CPBG) did not modify the mesenteric perfusion pressure. The vasoconstrictor effect elicited by 5-HT and alpha-methyl-5-HT was significantly decreased by ritanserin and by a selective 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist, N-3-pyridinyl-3, 5-dihydro-5-methyl-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dipyrrole-1(2H)-carboxamide hydrochloride (SB 206553), but was not modified by prazosin, propranolol, indomethacin or enalapril pretreatment. Our data suggest that the vasoconstrictor serotonergic response induced in the in situ autoperfused rat mesenteric vascular bed is mainly mediated by activation of 5-HT(2B) and/or 5-HT(2C) receptors.", 
    "499": "A novel human zinc metalloprotease that has considerable homology to human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (40% identity and 61% similarity) has been identified. This metalloprotease (angiotensin-converting enzyme homolog (ACEH)) contains a single HEXXH zinc-binding domain and conserves other critical residues typical of the ACE family. The predicted protein sequence consists of 805 amino acids, including a potential 17-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide sequence and a putative C-terminal membrane anchor. Expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells of a soluble, truncated form of ACEH, lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains, produces a glycoprotein of 120 kDa, which is able to cleave angiotensin I and angiotensin II but not bradykinin or Hip-His-Leu. In the hydrolysis of the angiotensins, ACEH functions exclusively as a carboxypeptidase. ACEH activity is inhibited by EDTA but not by classical ACE inhibitors such as captopril, lisinopril, or enalaprilat. Identification of the genomic sequence of ACEH has shown that the ACEH gene contains 18 exons, of which several have considerable size similarity with the first 17 exons of human ACE. The gene maps to chromosomal location Xp22. Northern blotting analysis has shown that the ACEH mRNA transcript is approximately 3. 4 kilobase pairs and is most highly expressed in testis, kidney, and heart. This is the first report of a mammalian homolog of ACE and has implications for our understanding of cardiovascular and renal function.", 
    "500": "The relative contributions of ANG II and bradykinin (BK) to the renal regional blood flow responses during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition remain unclear. This study was performed to evaluate renal cortical (CBF) and medullary blood flow (MBF) responses to intrarterial administration of enalaprilat (33 microg. kg(-1). min (-1)) after blockade of the ANG II AT(1 )receptors with candesartan (100 microg) in 7 dogs fed a low-salt diet (0.01%) for 5 days. Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to measure relative changes in CBF and MBF. Candesartan alone increased CBF (+20 +/- 2%) and MBF (+22 +/- 7%). Enalaprilat infusion after candesartan administration resulted in further increases in both CBF (+21 +/- 5%) and MBF (+41 +/- 8%). However, the relative changes in MBF were significantly greater (P < 0.01) than those in CBF. Administration of the BK B(2) receptor blocker icatibant (300 microg) after enalaprilat returned CBF and MBF to values seen with candesartan alone. These data support a substantive role for BK potentiation during ACE inhibitor-induced renal vasodilation in dogs maintained on a low-sodium diet, with a relatively greater effect on MBF compared to CBF.", 
    "501": "Two angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were isolated from a tryptic hydrolysate of human serum albumin (HSA). The peptides were identified by sequencing and other analyses as Ala-Trp and the nonapeptide Ala-Phe-Lys-Ala-Trp-Ala-Val-Ala-Arg (human albutensin A), corresponding to f(213-214) and f(210--218) of HSA, respectively. Synthetic versions of both peptides had previously been shown to have ACE inhibitory activity. The present results are the first to show that these peptides have a potential natural origin in humans. Additional studies were done to define the inhibitory properties of these peptides, as they had not been previously reported. The dipeptide and nonapeptide showed dose-dependent inhibition of ACE, with IC50 values of 12 and 1.7 micromol/l, respectively. Lineweaver-Burk plots suggested that Ala-Trp is a competitive inhibitor, and that human albutensin A is a noncompetitive inhibitor.", 
    "502": "We evaluated whether a novel dual inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), SA7060, (S)-2-[3-[(S)-2-(butoxycarbonyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-3-isobutylureido] -3-(2-naphtyl) propionic acid, prevents deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt-induced hypertension and related organ damage, such as cardiovascular hypertrophy, renal dysfunction and renal tissue injury in rats. The effectiveness was compared with candoxatril and enalapril, which are a selective NEP and ACE inhibitor, respectively. During DOCA-salt treatment for 4 weeks, the rats were given SA7060, candoxatril, enalapril or vehicle, once daily by gavage. The 4-weeks treatment with DOCA and salt produced progressive increases in systolic blood pressure. Daily administration of SA7060, candoxatril or enalapril significantly suppressed the development of hypertension induced by DOCA and salt, although the effect of enalapril was less potent at 4-weeks of the treatment period. In vehicle-treated DOCA-salt rats, decreases in creatinine clearance and increases in urinary excretion of protein and blood urea nitrogen were observed. This functional damage was improved most efficiently by the treatment with SA7060. There were significant increases in urinary excretions of atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic GMP in SA7060- or candoxatril-treated animals. Histopathological examination of the kidney in DOCA-salt rats revealed tubular, glomerular and vascular lesions, all of which were improved in animals given SA7060 or candoxatril. When the vascular hypertrophy of the aorta was evaluated, there were significant increases in wall thickness, wall area and the wall-to-lumen ratio in vehicle-treated DOCA-salt rats compared with the sham rats. The development of vascular hypertrophy was suppressed by the treatment with SA7060, candoxatril or enalapril. Our findings indicate that SA7060 efficiently prevents DOCA-salt-induced hypertension and related tissue injury, mainly by inhibiting NEP. Thus, SA7060 may be useful for treatment of both renin-dependent and renin-independent hypertensive subjects, although further studies examining efficiency in a renin-dependent hypertensive model are needed.",

Cumulative urinary recovery of free enalaprilat (active metabolite of enalapril) and the serum maximum concentration of free enalaprilat (Cmax) were the primary pharmacokinetic parameters used to determine bioequivalence in this study. Bioequivalence was defined as the geometric mean ratio (wafer: tablet) falling within the equivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25 for both parameters.", 
    "505": "Cumulative urinary recovery of free enalaprilat (0 - 72 hours) was similar between the wafer and conventional tablet formulations (arithmetic mean 5.13 vs. 5.03 mg, about 36% of dose). The geometric mean ratio of the urinary recovery of free enalaprilat (wafer: tablet) was 1.03 (90% CI: 0.93, 1.15). Cmax of serum enalaprilat was also similar between the wafer and conventional tablet formulations (arithmetic mean 85.7 vs. 76.3 ng/ml). The geometric mean Cmax ratio (wafer: tablet) was 1. 10 (90% CI: 1.00, 1.22). Both enalapril formulations were well tolerated.",

At the beginning and after one year, blood pressure biochemical profile and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were measured. After the initial evaluation, 53 patients received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and 53 beta-blockers (BB). Hydrochlorothiazide was added to achieve the blood pressure target < 140/90 mmHg.", 
    "509": "The average of UAE was 32.1 (43.1) mg/24 h, and 41 (39%) patients had microalbuminuretics.

The changes of UAE were only related with the baseline UAE values. Neither, age, sex, baseline diastolic BP and changes in diastolic BP were significantly related with the changes in UAE. In spite of similar mean BP reduction (medial BP 17.4 [10.9] vs 14.8 [10.4] mmHg), UAE only was reduced in patients treated with ACEi (LogUAE: 0.203 [0.872] mg/24 h; p < 0.04). In addition, in patients treated with BB a significative increase in baseline glucose (4.4 [12.3] mg/dl; p = 0.013) and uric acid (1.18 [4.18]; p = 0.031) were observed.",

    "511": "The voltammetric behavior of ramipril was studied using cyclic voltammetry, direct current polarography (DCt), differential pulse polarography (DPP) and alternating current polarography (ACt). Ramipril developed well-defined cathodic waves in Britton-Robinson buffers over the pH range 6-12. The waves were characterized as being diffusion-controlled, irreversible and partially affected by adsorption phenomenon. The diffusion-current constant (Id) was 1.24 +/- 0.02. The current-concentration plots were rectilinear over the range 10-50, 4-40 and 0.16-12 micrograms/ml in the DCt, DPP and ACt modes, respectively, with a minimum detectability (S/N = 2) of 0.02 microgram/ml (4.8 x 10(-8) M) using the latter mode. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of ramipril in commercial tablets. Hydrochlorothiazide, which is frequently co-formulated with ramipril, did not interfere with the assay. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied to the determination of ramipril in urine and plasma adopting the ACt technique. The percentage recoveries were 97.12 +/- 0.56 and 94.97 +/- 0.62%, respectively. A pathway for the electrode reaction was proposed.",

In addition, the first 5 groups of patients were maintained on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for 3 months as follows: group I on perindopril, II on ramipril, III on fosinopril, IV on lisinopril and V on captopril. Portal hemodynamics were determined before and after therapy (using an ultrasonic duplex system). New Doppler portal indices were derived and portal vein kinetic pressure was estimated for the first time by using data derived from the ultrasonic duplex system.",

No effects were noticed on the pulse, systolic, diastolic or mean blood pressures or Child-Pugh Score of liver disease.", 
    "515": "1) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors when added to endoscopic sclerotherapy can ameliorate the effects of the latter on portal hemodynamics in patients with portal hypertension; 2) Portal vein kinetic pressure, total portal circulation resistance index, portal vein wall stress index, compliance and distensibility indices are new Doppler portal indices that proved to be of value in the follow-up of patients with portal hypertension under sclerotherapy alone or in conjunction with pharmacotherapy; 3) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are safe drugs that can be used for portal decompression with endoscopic sclerotherapy. Their use as sole portal anti-hypertensive agents still awaits further studies.",

Fifteen untreated mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients and 13 normotensive subjects were enrolled in this study. Blood pressure, heart rate, lipid profiles, cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cGMP) and nitrite/nitrate (NOx), which are stable metabolites of NO, were measured. The hypertensive patients were treated with a calcium antagonist, benidipine (CAS 91559-74-5) (Ca group: n = 8) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, trandolapril (CAS 87679-37-6) (ACEI group: n = 7) and 12 weeks after the treatment the same examinations were performed. NOx and cGMP levels in hypertensive patients were significantly lower than those in normotensive subjects (32.3 +/- 4.1 versus 49.0 +/- 6.5 mumol/l and 2.16 +/- 0.39 versus 3.39 +/- 0.42 pmol/ml, respectively). Both antihypertensive agents decreased the elevated blood pressure (mean blood pressure; 120 +/- 3 to 99 +/- 3 mmHg in Ca group and 117 +/- 4 to 104 +/- 4 mmHg in ACEI group) and normalized the decreased NOx and cGMP levels (29.1 +/- 6.2 to 46.2 +/- 8.6 mumol/l and 1.96 +/- 0.37 to 3.20 +/- 0.71 pmol/ml in Ca group, 36.0 +/- 5.3 to 54.7 +/- 6.9 mumol/l and 2.45 +/- 0.52 to 2.87 +/- 0.43 pmol/ml in ACEI group, respectively). Either benidipine or trandolapril improves the endothelial function and increases the impaired basal release of NO in hypertension. This suggests the beneficial effects of the drugs on protection against the vascular complications in hypertension.",

Physiologic changes that occur with normal aging may complicate clinical assessment. Limited data from large clinical trials of heart failure therapy are applicable to aged patients. Available data suggest that elderly patients should be treated with the same regimen as younger patients but that more careful attention should be paid to dosing, especially when initiating a new drug. History and physical examination techniques can be used to uncover evidence of congestion and inadequate perfusion and are critical adjuncts when making therapeutic decisions. The objectives of therapy for elderly patients with heart failure must be individualized within the larger context of patients' goals and stage of life.",

He was treated with nitrates, heparin, beta-blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Because of the presence of some blood while vomiting no thrombolysis was given and abdominal echography was performed. This revealed a nodular mass at the right adrenal gland. Urinary catecholamines and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the suspected diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Before adrenectomy, a coronary angiography under alpha blocker therapy was performed, which demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease, although the patient showed ST-elevations on ECG. Pathological examination of the adrenal tumor was compatible with a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Postoperatively urinary catecholamines dropped dramatically, and the ECG normalised slowly over time. After 8 months the patient is still well. Blood pressure is well controlled with no antihypertensive drugs and exercise testing shows no evidence of myocardial ischaemia.",

The study was performed in general practitioners offices in Germany from 1991 to 1997. A total of 1298 patients with essential hypertension were included. Cardio- and cerebrovascular events, total mortality/morbidity and drug-saving effects in hypertensives treated according to two different methods of blood pressure measurement were the primary and secondary endpoints of the study. A total of 239 patients from group 1 (ABPM, n = 651), and 208 from group 2 (PM, n = 647) prematurely discontinued the study. The reason for discontinuation in 55 of these patients (20 from group 1 and 35 from group 2) was that they reached the main endpoint (total mortality/morbidity and cardio- and cerebrovascular events) of the study. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.037) in favour of group 1. Cardio- and cerebrovascular events also occurred in a lower number of patients (n = 14) in group 1, as compared to group 2 (n = 24). The difference however was not significant (P = 0. 097). A difference in a direct drug-saving effect could not be observed between the two groups but 22% of the initially screened patients were detected with the ABPM to have white coat hypertension and thus these patients did not receive antihypertensive treatment.",

Astute management in the primary care setting is essential for decreasing mortality and minimizing the risk for hospitalization. Although heart failure was initially viewed as a hemodynamic disorder, current evidence overwhelmingly supports that neurohormones, such as angiotensin II and aldosterone, contribute significantly to disease progression. The benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other drugs that block these substances are well established. This article discusses current management options that retard left ventricular remodeling to improve systolic function over time.",

    "543": "Despite multiple evidence-based data that diabetic nephropathy is largely preventable and its progression slowed by currently available interventions diabetic patients are often undertreated, especially for the lowering of blood pressure. Recent studies, (HOT Syst-Eur, SHEP, UKPDS, CAPPP, ABCD, HOPE) have confirmed the efficiency of intensively treated blood pressure in reducing morbidity-mortality in this group of patients at high risk. Low blood pressure targets are mandatory, but may not be that easy to achieve, especially in the presence of renal failure. Early prescription of a combination of antihypertensive drugs is often neccessary. Thus, the clinical question relates to the best combination of drugs. Most studies in hypertensive diabetic patients have dealt with 3 classes of antihypertensives drugs: diuretics, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors. Diuretics are one of the most efficient hypotensive drugs available for treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. Their use must be encouraged early in the stepped approach since diabetes is usually associated with mid-volume expansion due to hyperinsulinism and hyperadrenergic state. In spite of the proven benefit of beta-blockers in diabetic patients, these drugs are largely underused. The indications for selective beta-blockers should probably be broadened for most diabetic patients in primary prevention. Beta-blockers are essential in secondary prevention for patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. ACE-inhibitors are now more and more widely prescribed in diabetic patients at all stages of hypertension and nephropathy, but paradoxally their use has not been validated in Type 2 diabetic nephropathy. When the desired blood pressure target is obtained, cardiovascular outcome and probably also progression of diabetic nephropathy are significantly improved independently of a specific drug. Early combination therapy, including ACE-inhibitors, diuretics and beta-blockers, should be promptly proposed to all hypertensive diabetic patients to achieve low blood pressure and prevent high cardiovascular burden and progression of nephropathy.", 
    "544": "Renal remodelling in hyperinsulinic/insulinopenic states is mediated by glucotoxicity, endothelial dysfunction and vascular and nephron collagen turnover. Hypertensive and renal links are renewed by renoprotective interventions of renin-angiotensin. Vasoactive peptide processing and vascular collagen deposition are under the tight control of two zinc metalloproteinase families that regulate vascular tone and trophicity: gluzincins (or vasopeptidases) are convertases of angiotensins, endothelins or atrial natriuretic factors; and metzincins or matrix metalloproteases (MMP, matrixins)] regulate vascular type IV collagen basement membrane proteolysis. Association of natural tissue inhibitors of MMPs, pharmacological inhibitors of vasopeptidases [either conventional (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or innovative (omapatrilat)], together with synthetic MMP inhibitors, are currently screened to counteract vascular remodelling and renal scarring. Our studies focused on the 72 kDa (MMP-2) and 92 kDa (MMP-9) matrixin gelatinases and tissue inhibitors involved in basement membrane degradation and rebuilding. Three complementary settings were developed, allowing evaluations from basic to clinical stages. A leucocyte-endothelial transmigration model was designed for transcription and addressing of enzymes and inhibitors, in situ matrix degradation, and blockading by metalloprotease inhibitors (captopril). Insulin-resistant fructose-fed rats showed heavy proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis involving angiotensin II-dependent changes in renal gelatinases and inhibitors. Urinary gelatinolytic profiles from Type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy were compared with those of normal first-degree relatives and age-matched healthy controls. Physiologically, MMP-9 was the primary urinary gelatinolytic enzyme. In Type 2 diabetic proteinuric patients, MMP-9 and MMP-2 releases were significantly increased in the absence of renin-angiotensin blockade, while first-degree relatives showed reduced gelatinase levels suggestive of a genetic control of renal matrix regulation prior to potential glycaemic dysregulation. These preliminary data suggest that local MMP/TIMP imbalance is involved in diabetic renal remodelling. Further studies are needed to define the redundancies and specificities of vasopeptidase and MMP inhibitors, differentiate the antihypertensive effect from target-organ protection, screen for innovative pharmacological compounds, and validate simple, efficient biological markers of renal fibrosis progression and the effect of anti-fibrotic therapeutic interventions.", 
    "545": "Diabetic nephropathy is characterised by a progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix within the glomerular mesangium and the interstitium. The pathogenesis of this fibrotic process is still poorly understood, but in vitro and in vivo data suggest that TGF-B plays a key role. Local overproduction of TGF-B could be secondary to a synthesis of diacylglycerol, polyols, or glucosamines. It may also be secondary to an accumulation of advanced glycosylation end-products which modify the functions of neighbouring cells. Moreover, clinical as well as experimental data for TGF-B suggest that angiotensin II has a profibrotic effect; and it has been clearly demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a beneficial effect in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Other molecules such as endothelin-1, lipid peroxidation products, or IGF-1 may also play a role in this fibrotic process. Finally, heavy proteinuria secondary to glomerular lesions enhances the accumulation of extracellular matrix within the interstitium, probably through modifications of tubular cell functions, thereby inducing the release of pro-inflammatory and profibrotic molecules.", 
    "546": "Different side effects of drugs have been described in the oral cavity, including oral ulcerations. Direct contact between drugs and oral mucosa may induce chemical burn or local hypersensitivity. Less frequently, these drug-induced oral ulcerations are part of a complex reaction with cutaneous or systemic manifestations. Sometimes, one or more oral ulcerations appear as the main side-effect of a drug, or exceptionally as solitary lesions. Solitary oral ulcerations usually appear after few weeks of treatment. In most of cases, these lesions resist to conventional treatments, with a rapid healing following the suppression of the responsible drug. This diagnosis is usually difficult, particularly with patients receiving multiple drug therapy. Besides, special attention must be paid to new drugs. Oral ulcerations following symptoms of burning mouth, metallic taste, dysgueusia or agueusia are strongly suggestive of a pharmacological origin. Most of the molecules able to induce solitary oral ulcerations are commonly prescribed in a) rheumatology: NSAI (diclofenac, flurbiprofen, indomethacin, naproxen), long-term rheumatoid arthritis therapy (azathioprine, methotrexate, penicillamine, gold compounds, tiopronin); b) cardiology: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin 2-receptor antagonist (losartan), anti-angorous (nicorandil), c) psychiatry: antidepressants (fluoxetine, lithium), d) AIDS therapy (foscarnet, zalcitabine).",

Risk factors for moderate chronic renal insufficiency were identified using a proportional hazards model controlling for age, sex, race, systolic blood pressure, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use. The risk for developing moderate chronic renal insufficiency was associated with diabetes mellitus (relative risk, 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 3.3) and elevated hemoglobin A(1c) levels. Compared with subjects with normoglycemia (hemoglobin A(1c) </= 5.7%), the relative risk for moderate chronic renal insufficiency for patients in the upper quartile of hemoglobin A(1c) (>9.0%) was 2.7 (95% CI, 1.4 to 5.1). The development of moderate chronic renal insufficiency was also independently predicted by elevated maximum serum cholesterol level. Compared with subjects with maximum cholesterol levels of 250 mg/dL or less, the relative risk for those with maximum cholesterol levels greater than 350 mg/dL was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.1 to 5.2). Similar relative risks were obtained when moderate chronic renal insufficiency was defined by the development of an increase in serum creatinine level. Hypercholesterolemia was also associated with moderate chronic renal insufficiency among persons without diabetes. In conclusion, the risk for developing moderate chronic renal insufficiency is increased by diabetes and elevated hemoglobin A(1c) and serum cholesterol levels. Modification of these risk factors may decrease the incidence of moderate chronic renal insufficiency.",

Three data sets related to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, squalene epoxidase inhibition and HIV protease inhibition were used to investigate the outcome of hypothesis optimisation. Simplex optimisation using leave-one-out cross-validation during the hypothesis refinement resulted in improved models with respect to predictivity of an external test set. Furthermore, the utilisation of the geometry of the active site for the HIV protease inhibitors, represented by Catalyst 'excluded volume' features, resulted in an optimised hypothesis with improved predictivity compared with the corresponding hypothesis derived without receptor information.", 
    "549": "Rilmenidine is an antihypertensive agent with selectivity for I1 imidazoline receptors that acts both centrally by reducing sympathetic overactivity and in the kidney by inhibiting the Na+/H+ antiport. Rilmenidine provides antihypertensive efficacy comparable with that of diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Experience from trials and clinical practice highlights rilmenidine's clinical and metabolic acceptability in hypertensive populations, including those at special risk because of old age, renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia. In the at-risk hypertensive, rilmenidine reduces left ventricular hypertrophy to a similar degree to other reference agents. New studies show a significant improvement in glucose metabolism in metabolic syndrome patients treated with rilmenidine, and a significant reduction in microalbuminuria during rilmenidine treatment of hypertensive type 2 diabetics. Thus the efficacy/tolerance ratio of rilmenidine supports its role as a first-line antihypertensive option for all groups of hypertensive patient, with specific advantages in some at-risk populations.",

The use of intensive cardiac procedures increased in the same period; the 1-year cumulative incidence rate of catheterization increased from 28% in 1988 to 31% in 1994, that of angioplasty rose from 8% to 15% and that of coronary artery bypass surgery from 6% to 8%. Prescriptions for ASA, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increased, and prescriptions for nitrates and calcium antagonists decreased.

A significant relationship (P < 0.05) between changes in systolic and diastolic ABP and the decrease in UAE at 52 weeks was seen in both groups. The decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was stabilized at the end of therapy and was identical in both treatment groups.

Also, it is known that the vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and endothelin (ET)-1 may be implicated in the deterioration of glomerular hemodynamics caused in the OK. We therefore designed the present study to examine the effect of Zn deficiency on the expression of ET-1 and a potential role of endogenous angiotensin II in the expression of ET-1 in glomeruli of the OK of 72 hours duration.",

However, the expression of prepro-ET-1 mRNA and ET-1 was substantially increased in the OK of the Zn-deficient diet group relative to the OK of the standard diet group. There were no significant differences in the expression of prepro-ET-1 mRNA and ET-1 between the CLK of the two diet groups. Administration of enalapril restored the expression of prepro-ET-1 mRNA and ET-1 in the OK to levels seen in the CLK in the standard and the Zn-deficient diet groups. Enalapril produced no effects on the expression of prepro-ET-1 mRNA and ET-1 in the CLK of the two diet groups.",

    "572": "The heptapeptide, angiotensin-(1-7), is an active member of the renin-angiotensin system. The present study was designed to characterize the role of endothelium in relaxations of large cerebral arteries to angiotensin-(1-7). Rings of canine middle cerebral arteries were suspended in organ chambers for isometric force recording. The levels of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) were assessed by radioimmunoassay. During contraction to uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP, 3x10(-6) to 10(-5) mol/l), angiotensin-(1-7) (10(-9) to 3x10(-5) mol/l) caused concentration-dependent relaxations in arteries with endothelium, but not in endothelium-denuded vessels. Angiotensin-(1-7) significantly increased formation of cGMP. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 3x10(-4) mol/l), and selective soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, 1 H-[1,2, 4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinozalin-1-one (ODQ, 3x10(-6) mol/l), abolished angiotensin-(1-7)-induced relaxations. Angiotensin receptor antagonists, losartan (10(-5) mol/l), PD 123319 (10(-5) mol/l), [Sar(1),Thr(8)]-angiotensin II (10(-5) mol/l) [Sar(1),Val(5), Ala(8)]-angiotensin II (10(-5) mol/l) or [7-D-Ala]-angiotensin 1-7 (10(-6) mol/l) did not affect these relaxations. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (10(-5) mol/l) augmented relaxations to angiotensin-(1-7). Finally, bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist, [D-Arg(0),Hyp(3),Thi(5),D-Tic(7), Oic(8)]-bradykinin (HOE 140, 5x10(-8) mol/l) significantly reduced the effect of angiotensin-(1-7), while bradykinin B(1) receptor antagonist, des-Arg(9), [Leu(8)]-bradykinin (6x10(-9) mol/l) did not influence the vascular response to the heptapeptide. These findings indicate that (1) angiotensin-(1-7) produces relaxation of canine middle cerebral arteries by the release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells, (2) angiotensin receptors do not mediate endothelium-dependent relaxations to the heptapeptide, and (3) this effect appears to be dependent on activation of local production of kinins. Our studies support the concept that angiotensin-(1-7), as a natural vasodilator hormone, may counterbalance the hemodynamic actions of angiotensin II.",

Patients with moderate or severe hypertension, currently treated with at least two single-agent drugs (excluding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above 90 mm Hg, and at least one undesirable drug-related symptom were randomized to once-daily treatment with one of the combinations for 12 weeks. Losartan/HCTZ lowered sitting DBP from the prior therapy baseline by 13.7 mm Hg and sitting systolic blood pressure 19.3 mm Hg; similar reductions occurred with enalapril/HCTZ. Trough sitting DBP was reduced to normal levels (< 90 mm Hg) in 63% of patients switched to the losartan combination and in 58% of those treated with the enalapril combination. Each combination was associated with improved tolerability compared with prior therapy, although fewer patients reported each of 24 undesirable symptoms after 12 weeks of losartan/HCTZ. The improvement from prior therapy in the occurrence of cough was significantly greater with losartan/HCTZ (P = .005). Enalapril/HCTZ, but not losartan/HCTZ, increased serum uric acid levels at week 12. In conclusion, the combination of losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg offers a beneficial therapeutic option for patients with a history of moderate to severe hypertension whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled or who exhibit side effects while on two or more single-agent antihypertensive drugs. In this population, the switch from prior antihypertensive therapies to once daily losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg improves blood pressure control and reduces side effects.",

Vasodilator responses to EFS were not affected by captopril treatment, although they were smaller in the hypertensive group. Acetylcholine (10 ng) induced similar decreases in perfusion pressure of normotensive and 1K1C groups; captopril did not influence these responses. These results indicate that captopril treatment does not affect the reduced neurogenic vasodilation but normalizes the augmented sympathetic-mediated vasoconstrictor responses of mesenteric resistance vessels of chronic 1K1C hypertensive rats.",

    "603": "Angiotensin receptor antagonists are effective drugs for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension which have a side effect profile similar to placebo. Their role in the management of hypertension remains to be defined, but they are of particular use to patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors because of cough. It is uncertain at the present time whether the benefits of ACE inhibition in other disorders such as congestive heart failure and following myocardial infarction will be similar for angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "604": "Two viscosity grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC 4000 and 15,000 cps) and Carbopol 934P were used to prepare captopril floating tablets. In vitro dissolution was carried out in simulated gastric fluid (enzyme free) at 37 degrees C +/- 0.1 degree C using the USP apparatus 2 basket method. Compared to conventional tablets, release of captopril from these floating tablets was apparently prolonged; as a result, a 24-hr controlled-release dosage form for captopril was achieved. Drug release best fit both the Higuchi model and the Korsmeyer and Peppas equation, followed by first-order kinetics. While tablet hardness and stirring rate had no or little effect on the release kinetics, tablets hardness was found to be a determining factor with regard to the buoyancy of the tablets.", 
    "605": "Congestive heart failure causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Symptoms and physical findings can help in diagnosis, but have limited sensitivity and specificity. Objective measurement of ventricular function is essential in virtually all patients in whom heart failure is suspected; reversible causes of heart failure must be sought. Out-patient management includes education and counseling, emphasis on and assessment of compliance with diet, and pharmacological treatment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the mainstay of treatment but are underused, and maximal doses are not given, apparently because of concern about side-effects. Diuretics should be administered only as needed to manage fluid overload. Calcium channel blockers are relatively contraindicated in patients with impaired ventricular function. Patient follow-up should be guided by results of the medical history and physical examination. Routine serial testing of ventricular function and exercise performance is discouraged.", 
    "606": "The non-insulin-dependent DIABetes, HYpertension, microalbuminuria or proteinuria, CARdiovascular events, and Ramipril (DIABHYCAR) study is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial of the ACE inhibitor ramipril (1.25 mg/day) in patients with type II diabetes and micro- or macroalbuminuria. The main outcome of the study is the time to first occurrence of either death from a cardiovascular origin, including sudden death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive heart failure, or requirement of hemodialysis or renal transplantation. The study was launched in France in early 1995 with the participation of general practitioners only, but had to be extended to 15 other countries in 1997 due to difficulties in recruitment. Since 2.5 years after the beginning of the trial the observed event rate was much less than anticipated, it was decided to increase recruitment and follow-up duration and to include congestive heart failure in the definition of the main outcome to keep the study power at a satisfactory level. Recruitment ended on April 1, 1998 with 4937 randomized patients. Following the early discontinuation for efficacy of another study of ramipril in high cardiovascular risk patients, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study (HOPE), the second interim analysis of DIABHYCAR was performed early (when 406 instead of 500 patients presented a main outcome) and the Data Safety and Monitoring Board recommended that the study continue. Follow-up is planned to end on March 31, 2001.", 
    "607": "Approximately 20% of patients with healed myocardial infarction develop asymptomatic progressive left ventricular (LV) dilation and remodeling and are at increased risk for progression to symptomatic congestive heart failure and premature death. It was the goal of this study to test whether quinapril may interrupt this process and to analyze potential mechanisms. Of 138 patients with an average infarct age of 56 months, 25 had asymptomatic progressive LV dilation and were randomized in a prospective, double-blind study to placebo or quinapril. At baseline (mean +/- SEM) ejection fraction was reduced (35 +/- 3% and 39 +/- 3%) and end-diastolic volume (gated single-photon emission computed tomography) increased (104 +/- 9 and 117 +/- 12 ml/m(2)) with placebo (n = 13) and quinapril (n = 12), respectively. Progressive dilation continued in patients taking placebo (6 months: 9.4 +/- 5.2 ml/m(2), 12 months 24.6 +/- 5. 4 ml/m(2); change from baseline: p <0.05 vs baseline; p <0.05 vs 6 months), but not with quinapril (6 months: -0.9 +/- 4.0 ml/m(2); 12 months: 4.1 +/- 5.2 ml/m(2) [p <0.05] vs placebo). Wedge pressure during bicycle exercise was similar at baseline, but at 12 months tended to be lower with quinapril (17 +/- 1 mm Hg) than with placebo (24 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = 0.1673). Thus, quinapril prevented further progression of asymptomatic LV dilation and remodeling after remote myocardial infarction, possibly due to attenuation of an exercise-induced increase in LV filling pressure.", 
    "608": "Human somatic angiotensin I-converting enzyme (sACE) has two active sites present in two homologous protein domains, resulting from a tandem gene duplication. It has been proposed that the N- and C-terminal active sites can have specific in vivo roles. In Drosophila melanogaster, Ance and Acercode for two ACE-like single-domain proteins, also predicted to have distinct physiological roles. We have investigated the relationship of Ance and Acer to the N- and C-domains of human sACE by genomic sequence analysis and by using domain-selective inhibitors, including RXP 407, a selective inhibitor of the human N-domain. These phosphinic peptides were potent inhibitors of Acer, but not of Ance. We conclude that the active sites of the N-domain and of Acer share structural features that permit the binding of the unusual RXP407 inhibitor and the hydrolysis of a broader range of peptide structures. In comparison, Ance, like the human C-domain of ACE, displays greater inhibitor selectivity. From the analysis of the published sequence of the Adh region of Drosophila chromosome 2, which carries Ance, Acer, and four additional ACE-like genes, we also suggest that this functional conservation is reflected in an ancestral gene structure identifiable in both protostome and deuterostome lineages and that the duplication seen in vertebrate genomes predates the divergence of these lineages. The conservation of ACE enzymes with distinct active sites in the evolution of both vertebrate and invertebrate species provides further evidence that these two kinds of active sites have different physiological functions.", 
    "609": "Quenched fluorescence peptides were used to investigate the substrate specificity requirements for recombinant wild-type angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and two full-length mutants bearing a single functional active site (N- or C-domain). We assayed two series of bradykinin-related peptides flanked by o-aminobenzoic acid (Abz) and N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine (EDDnp), namely, Abz-GFSPFXQ-EDDnp and Abz-GFSPFRX-EDDnp (X = natural amino acids), in which the fluorescence appeared when Abz/EDDnp are separated by substrate hydrolysis. Abz-GFSPFFQ-EDDnp was preferentially hydrolyzed by the C-domain while Abz-GFSPFQQ-EDDnp exhibits higher N-domain specificity. Internally quenched fluorescent analogues of N-acetyl-SDKP-OH were also synthesized and assayed. Abz-SDK(Dnp)P-OH, in which Abz and Dnp (2,4-dinitrophenyl) are the fluorescent donor-acceptor pair, was cleaved at the D-K(Dnp) bond with high specificity by the ACE N-domain (k(cat)/K(m) = 1.1 microM(-)(1) s(-)(1)) being practically resistant to hydrolysis by the C-domain. The importance of hydroxyl-containing amino acids at the P(2) position for N-domain specificity was shown by performing the kinetics of hydrolysis of Abz-TDK(Dnp)P-OH and Abz-YDK(Dnp)P-OH. The peptides Abz-YRK(Dnp)P-OH and Abz-FRK(Dnp)P-OH which were hydrolyzed by wild-type ACE with K(m) values of 5.1 and 4.0 microM and k(cat) values of 246 and 210 s(-)(1), respectively, have been shown to be excellent substrates for ACE. The differentiation of the catalytic specificity of the C- and N-domains of ACE seems to depend on very subtle variations on substrate-specific amino acids. The presence of a free C-terminal carboxyl group or an aromatic moiety at the same substrate position determines specific interactions with the ACE active site which is regulated by chloride and seems to distinguish the activities of both domains.", 
    "610": "The present study compared renoprotective effects of angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist (AT1RA) with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and their influence on the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS). Experimental nephrotic syndrome was induced in SD rats by repeated peritoneal injections of puromycin. Twenty-eight rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control, nephrotic control, ACEI-treated, and AT1RA-treated groups. Serum, urine, and renal tissue were collected for study at the end of 12 weeks. Compared with those of the nephrotic control group, urinary protein was less and renal function was better in both treated groups. The glomerular and interstitial damage indexes of both ACEI- and AT1RA-treated rats were lower than those of nephrotic control rats, with no significant difference observed between the two treated groups. Local renal ACE activity and angiotensin II concentration were elevated in nephrotic rats (p< 0.01). However, there is no significant difference in circulating RAS, renal tissue renin, and aldosterone between the normal control and nephrotic control rats. As expected, enalapril inhibited the local renal ACE activity and significantly decreased angiotensin II (p< 0.01). Intrarenal ACE activity and angiotensin concentration returned to normal levels after treatment with irbesartan (p< 0.01). In conclusion, AT1RA and ACEI have comparable renal protective effects, and these protective effects were associated with the inhibition of intrarenal ANG II.", 
    "611": "It has been suggested that nitric oxide (NO) influences the actions of L-glutamate and angiotensin II in the brain. In the present study, we examined whether cardiovascular responses to L-glutamate and angiotensin II would be altered in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) of rats treated with an NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Wistar rats were treated with either L-NAME (100 mg/kg/day, n=9) or vehicle (n=8) for 4 weeks. L-glutamate (2 nmol/50 nl) or angiotensin 11 (100 pmol) was then microinjected into unilateral RVLM of anesthetized rats. Upon completion of the experiments, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of the brain stem was measured. The systolic blood pressure after 4 weeks of the treatment was significantly higher in the L-NAME group (203+/-8 mmHg) than in the control group (142+/-3 mmHg, p< 0.01). The pressor response to L-glutamate microinjected into the RVLM was significantly greater in the L-NAME group (31+/-2 mmHg) than in the control group (24+/-1 mmHg, p< 0.01). Similarly, angiotensin II showed a greater pressor response in the L-NAME group. ACE activity of the brain stem did not differ between the groups. In conclusion, NO may have an inhibitory influence on the actions of L-glutamate and angiotensin II in the RVLM.", 
    "612": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to be the most effective antihypertensive drugs for reducing left ventricular mass in hypertensives when compared to other classes of drugs. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of imidapril, an ACE inhibitor, on serum procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide (PIIIP) levels as well as the left ventricular mass index (LVMI). The subjects consisted of 15 patients (12 men and 3 women) in the outpatient clinic of our hospital who were diagnosed as essential hypertensives and who had not been treated with any antihypertensive medication prior to the study. Left ventricular hypertrophy was observed in all of the patients, ie., LVMI >110 g/m2 in men and >106 g/m2 in women. Blood pressure, LVMI, and serum PIIIP levels were measured before and after treatment with imidapril for 6 months. The starting dose of imidapril was 5 mg, and this was increased to 10 mg. Finally, 1 mg of trichlormethiazide was added to obtain adequate control of blood pressure. Blood pressure significantly decreased in 12 patients, and the mean LVMI decreased significantly from 153.1 +/- 9.0 to 135.4 +/- 6.3 (p< 0.01) after treatment. The changes in LVMI and PIIIP levels with treatment had significant correlation (r=0.639, p< 0.05). The present study showed that imidapril reduces the left ventricular mass in hypertensives after 6 months of treatment, and that this may at least in part be due to a decrease in the collagen content of the hypertrophied heart, suggesting that serum PIIIP levels are a useful marker of the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "613": "Our objective was to compare three different methods of blood pressure measurement through the results of a controlled study aimed at comparing the antihypertensive effects of trandolapril and losartan. Two hundred and twenty-nine hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind parallel group study. After a 3-week placebo period, they received either 2 mg trandolapril or 50 mg losartan once daily for 6 weeks. At the end of both placebo and active treatment periods, three methods of blood pressure measurement were used: a) office blood pressure (three consecutive measurements); b) home self blood pressure measurements (SBPM), consisting of three consecutive measurements performed at home in the morning and in the evening for 7 consecutive days; and c) ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM), 24-h BP recordings with three measurements per hour. Of the 229 patients, 199 (87%) performed at least 12 valid SBPM measurements during both placebo and treatment periods, whereas only 160 (70%) performed good quality 24-h ABPM recordings during both periods (P < .0001). One hundred-forty patients performed the three methods of measurement well. At baseline and with treatment, agreement between office measurements and ABPM or SBPM was weak. Conversely, there was a good agreement between ABPM and SBPM. The mean difference (SBP/DBP) between ABPM and SBPM was 4.6 +/- 10.4/3.5 +/- 7.1 at baseline and 3.5 +/- 10.0/4.0 +/- 7.0 at the end of the treatment period. The correlation between SBPM and ABPM expressed by the r coefficient and the P values were the following: at baseline 0.79/0.70 (< 0.001/< .0001), with active treatment 0.74/0.69 (0.0001/.0001). Hourly and 24-h reproducibility of blood pressure response was quantified by the standard deviation of BP response. Compared with office blood pressure, both global and hourly SBPM responses exhibited a lower standard deviation. Hourly reproducibility of SBPM response (10.8 mm Hg/6.9 mm Hg) was lower than hourly reproducibility of ABPM response (15.6 mm Hg/11.9 mm Hg). In conclusion, SBPM was easier to perform than ABPM. There was a good agreement between these two methods whereas concordance between SBPM or ABPM and office measurements was weak. As hourly reproducibility of SBPM response is better than reproducibility of both hourly ABPM and office BP response, SBPM seems to be the most appropriate method for evaluating residual antihypertensive effect.", 
    "614": "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may affect blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients receiving drug treatment, but data on the effects of low-dose aspirin are scanty. This study assessed the effects of chronic treatment with low doses of aspirin (100 mg/day) on clinic and ambulatory systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP in hypertensives on chronic, stable antihypertensive therapy. The study was conducted in the framework of the Primary Prevention Project (PPP), a randomized, controlled factorial trial on the preventive effect of aspirin or vitamin E in people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors. Fifteen Italian hypertension units studied 142 hypertensive patients (76 men, 66 women; mean age 59 +/- 5.9 years) treated with different antihypertensive drugs: 71 patients were randomized to aspirin and 71 served as controls. All patients underwent a clinic BP evaluation with an automatic sphygmomanometer and a 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, at baseline and after 3 months of aspirin treatment. At the end of the study the changes in clinic SBP and DBP were not statistically different in treated and untreated subjects. Ambulatory SBP and DBP after 3 months of aspirin treatment were similar to baseline: deltaSBP -0.5 mmHg (95% confidence intervals [CI] from -1.9 to +2.9 mm Hg) and deltaDBP -1.1 mm Hg (95% CI from -2.5 to +0.3 mm Hg). The pattern was similar in the control group. No interaction was found between aspirin and the most used antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists). Despite the relatively small sample size our results seem to exclude any significant influence of low-dose aspirin on BP control in hypertensives under treatment.",

Antihypertensive consumption was studied using the defined daily dose (DDD) and the DHD (DDD/1000 inhabitants/day) of each drug, as defined by the Drug Utilization Research Group of the European Office of the World Health Organization. The anatomical classification of hypotensive drugs has been made according to EPhMRA (European Pharmaceutical Market Association) guidelines. A significant increase of 117.4% (41.39/90 DHD) in antihypertensive drug consumption was observed in the period 1986 to 1994. In 1986 diuretics were the most consumed (30.27 DHD), followed by calcium antagonists (5.37), beta-blockers (3.93), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (1.37). In 1994 ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and beta-blockers increased significantly (P < .0001), whereas diuretics were still the most commonly prescribed. Nifedipine and captopril were the most used among calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors. National and international recommendations had no effect on prescription patterns. Antihypertensive therapy of all types is increasing in Spain. Diuretics remain the most popular, beta-blockers stay stable, whereas the newer types are rising rapidly. National and international recommendations had no effect on prescription patterns.",

We evaluated whether P(g-a)CO2 reflects whole body (Q) and splanchnic (Qsp) blood flow, oxygen delivery (DO2) and consumption (VO2) after coronary artery by pass graft (CABG) operation. Thirty patients received dobutamine or dopexamine to increase cardiac index, 15 patients enalapril or sodium nitroprusside to lower blood pressure, and 30 patients were controls. We measured Q, Qsp (hepatic vein catheter and indocyanine green), and gastric mucosal PCO2 (nasogastric tonometer) before and after interventions. Multiple linear regression model showed that none of the changes in Q, Qsp, and splanchnic or systemic DO2 and VO2 significantly explained changes in P(g-a)CO2 (deltaP(g-a)CO2). All independent variables together explained only 7% of deltaP(g-a)CO2. Increased splanchnic blood flow (0.65 +/- .19 vs. 0.94 +/- .31 L/min/m2, P < 0.001) and increased splanchnic DO2 (101 +/- 28 vs. 143 +/- 42 mL/min/m2, P < 0.001) during catecholamine infusions were associated with increased P(g-a)CO2 (8 +/- 8 vs. 11 +/- 7 mmHg, P = 0.003). P(g-a)CO2 does not reflect whole body or splanchnic blood flow, DO2 or VO2 after CABG operations.

In this article, we review the current recommendations concerning AMI treatment, as well as our therapeutic approach, which is based on the evidence provided by several large well controlled clinical trials. Mid and long term prognosis are mainly related to the development of left ventricular dysfunction which determines heart failure, the occurrence of severe ventricular arrhythmias and the persistence of residual myocardial ischemia.

Over recent years, several well controlled studies have been devoted to heart failure. They allow to propose guidelines which fulfill all the requirements of Evidence-Based Medicine. These recommendations, however, are not always easy to apply in the individual patient. Guidelines for the sometimes difficult diagnosis of heart failure will be reviewed. On the basis of the results of large controlled clinical trials, we shall envisage the comprehensive treatment of a heart failure patient taking into account the functional class as well as some individual characteristics (age, presence of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency). The different pharmacologic agents which have demonstrated efficacy will be reviewed and the strategies to avoid the potential pitfalls of their simultaneous use will be indicated. The key role of the general practitioner in the surveillance and titration of heart failure therapy will be emphasized.", 
    "624": "In the 1980s and early 1990s, evidence suggesting a pivotal role for chronic neurohormonal stimulation in the pathophysiology of heart failure began to emerge, which has now produced a dramatic change in the way heart failure is viewed and treated. Preclinical data and results from clinical trials revealed that blocking the actions or generation of norepinephrine or angiotensin II positively affected the course of left ventricular dysfunction and myocardial failure, despite the fact that this inhibition had minimal or negative effects on hemodynamics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been used for heart failure for many years, but only recently have beta-blockers been recommended as part of standard treatment for heart failure. The negative inotropic effects of beta-blockers are well known; these agents must be used with caution in patients with heart failure. However, after several months of treatment, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) gradually increases, and a reversal of the pathological remodeling associated with chronic heart failure occurs: left ventricular mass decreases, chamber shape becomes more elliptical, and mitral regurgitation decreases. Data from clinical trials have shown that long-term beta-adrenergic blockade halts the progression of pump dysfunction, substantially improves left ventricular function, and reduces morbidity and mortality rates in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. This article provides a detailed rationale for the use of beta-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure, based on the current understanding of pathophysiology and recent clinical trial data.", 
    "625": "The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival (ATLAS) results have been widely quoted by proponents advocating the use of \"high\" doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for the treatment of heart failure. In ATLAS, however, the relative benefits of \"high\" versus \"low\" dose ACE inhibition were small. Intermediate doses of ACE inhibitors proven effective in previous placebo-controlled trials provide benefit that appears likely to equal or exceed the benefit from \"high\" dose ACE inhibition. Therefore, we recommend that physicians continue to prescribe ACE inhibitors for patients with heart failure based on the target doses used in the placebo-controlled trials and not on the \"high\" dose target used in ATLAS.", 
    "626": "To investigate whether prevention of remodeling would translate into a more stable electrophysiological profile, the investigators randomized 56 patients to treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or placebo for 3 months after myocardial infarction. Programmed electrical stimulation revealed no significant differences in inducibility of monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), whereas ventricular fibrillation (VF) tended to be lower in the ACE-inhibitor group. Effective refractory periods were consistently longer, and dispersion of refractoriness was significantly shorter in the ACE-inhibitor group. The investigators conclude that in this small patient group ACE inhibition may mildly add to a more stable electrophysiological profile.",

The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119).

We studied 10 middle age patients with essential hypertension (treated with ACEI--enarenal at least 1 yr.) and 10 age, gender matched control subjects. Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated from the 24-hr ambulatory electrocardiograms by the Fourier transformation. Power spectra were quantified at 0.003-0.04 Hz--very low frequency power (VLF), 0.04-0.15 Hz--low frequency power (LF) and 0.15-0.40 Hz--high frequency power (HF).

    "633": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers are two separate classes of drugs. Although they are both effective antihypertensive agents, they exert their effects through different pharmacological mechanisms. Nonetheless, they have often proved indistinguishable in terms of the surrogate endpoints used in short term clinical studies. Considerable data are available on the long term benefits of ACE inhibition; however, studies looking at the long term effects of AT1 receptor blockade are not yet complete. If ACE inhibitors prove to be distinguishable from AT1 receptor blockers in terms of disease-related outcomes, the reason may be the selective effects of ACE inhibitors on insulin resistance and insulin-mediated vascular function.", 
    "634": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers share a number of common properties, including their ability to lower blood pressure. However, they can be differentiated based on their individual effects on the renin-angiotensin system, the fibrinolytic system and the actions of bradykinin. They act at different points in the cascade of events that constitute the renin-angiotensin system. In animal models of atherosclerosis, ACE inhibition was associated with a significant reduction in the percentage surface area of lesions, while no similar effect was evident with AT1 receptor blockade. In the fibrinolytic system, both ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade were associated with reduced aldosterone levels, although the effect was greater with ACE inhibition; only ACE inhibition was associated with a significant reduction in plasminogen activation inhibitor-1. By blocking the degradation of bradykinin, ACE inhibitors potentiate the ability of bradykinin to reduce blood pressure and stimulate the release of tissue-type plasminogen activator from the vasculature, an effect not seen with AT1 receptor blockers.", 
    "635": "Various clinical studies have been undertaken to assess whether medical interventions are effective for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. In the Angioplasty Compared with MEdical therapy (ACME) and Randomized Intervention Treatment of Angina 2 (RITA-2) studies, a medical strategy was associated with significantly fewer adverse cardiovascular events, but percutaneous revascularization was associated with greater functional improvement. In the Atorvastatin VErsus Revascularization Treatment (AVERT) study, aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin was more effective than angioplasty at reducing the total number of ischemic events; however, angioplasty was superior in terms of functional improvements. Thus, to prevent ischemic events in this population, coronary artery disease is best treated systemically; if better symptom control is required, angioplasty is still necessary. In the effects of QUinapril On Vascular ACE and Determinants of ISchemia (QUO VADIS) study, treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril was associated with significantly fewer ischemic events than placebo at one year following coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, no significant differences were found between treatments in terms of primary and other secondary outcomes. For patients who have undergone bypass surgery, long term ACE inhibitor therapy may be of benefit, although further studies are warranted.",

    "637": "Medical therapy of myocardial infarction has changed over the last 30 years. The \"lag phenomenon\", i.e. the time lapsing from the appraisal of a new, relevant scientific evidence and its practical adoption, has been variable, and different from one treatment to another. It has been very short for GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in candidates for urgent coronary angioplasty after myocardial infarction, short for ACE inhibitors, and it has been also short for the decrease in the prescription of calcium channel inhibitors after controversial scientific evidence. This time lapse has been long for beta-blockers, that only now are used quite extensively in Italy: from less than 10% of hospitalized patients during the early '80s, to over 60% nowadays. This evolution of medical therapy has been progressive and continuous, has not been divided into two eras, and thrombolysis seems to have little to do with it. The extensive introduction of thrombolysis has simply divided patients with acute myocardial infarction into two subgroups, very different for clinical characteristics: candidates for this therapy, and \"others\". Candidates for thrombolysis have a much better prognosis, but for a \"paradox effect\" they have been studied much more than the others. Now, the bulk of publications concerning patients undergoing thrombolysis carries the risk of spreading the concept that myocardial infarction has changed. We do not think that this corresponds to reality. Probably, the concepts that have guided medical therapy have been very similar and unchanged over the years, and both medical and surgical plus coronary angioplasty therapies are today much more appropriately used than yesterday.",

    "642": "Telmisartan (Micardis (R)) is a new, orally active, long-acting angio-tensin (Ang) II receptor antagonist that is effective in the treatment of hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has emerged as an important method for evaluating the consistency of the antihypertensive effects of a drug throughout the dosing interval. ABPM was used to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan in several placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies. Patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were allocated randomly to groups to receive telmisartan 40 or 80 mg, losartan 50 mg, or placebo, once daily in a 6-week, fixed-dose study, or telmisartan 40-120 mg, amlodipine 5-10 mg, or placebo, once daily in a 12-week, dose-titration study. Patients treated with telmisartan 40 and 80 mg or placebo in a separate 4-week, fixed-dose study were included in an additional analysis. Telmisartan 40 and 80 mg significantly decreased mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) relative to placebo for the entire 24 h period and in the following intervals: day (6 a.m. to 10 p.m.), morning (6 a.m. to noon), night (10 p.m. to 6 a.m), and the last 4 h of the dosing interval (P<0.01). Notably, telmisartan 40 or 80 mg was more effective than losartan, especially during the last 4-6 h of the dosing interval (P<0.05). Telmisartan 40- 120 mg tended to be more effective than amlodipine 5-10 mg in reducing SBP and DBP in each time interval, with significant differences between treatments noted for DBP in the last 4 h of the dosing interval and in the morning (P < 0.05). ABPM also revealed that the magnitude of the blood pressure decreasing effect with telmisartan was consistent throughout the dosing interval. These results demonstrate that telmisartan maintains a normal circadian blood pressure pattern and provides full 24 h blood pressure control with once-daily dosing.", 
    "643": "The physiological effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may be in part mediated by bradykinin. We investigated the effect of coadministration of the specific bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist icatibant on hemodynamic and neurohormonal responses to acute intravenous ACE inhibition in normal men on a normal sodium diet. We performed a 4-phase, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled study in 12 male volunteers. The bradykinin antagonist icatibant (10 mg IV) was coadministered over the first 15 minutes of a 2-hour infusion of the ACE inhibitor perindoprilat (1.5 mg IV). Perindoprilat inhibited ACE activity and elicited the expected changes in active renin concentration and angiotensin peptides. Over the 3 hours after the start of drug infusion, perindoprilat lowered and icatibant increased mean arterial blood pressure (each P<0.0005 versus placebo). Coadministration of icatibant attenuated the mean arterial blood pressure response to perindoprilat (P<0.0005) but had no effect on neurohormonal responses to perindoprilat. Our study indicates that the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist icatibant attenuates the short-term blood pressure-lowering effect of acute ACE inhibition in normal men on a normal sodium diet. Bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonism alone increases resting blood pressure. Bradykinin may be involved in the control of blood pressure in the resting state in humans.", 
    "644": "The appearance of cough in association with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is thought to be related to bradykinin, and it has been speculated that the elicitation of adverse effects is genetically predetermined. Several polymorphisms of the human bradykinin B(2) receptor gene may be involved in ACE inhibitor-related cough. To investigate this possibility, we identified the -58 thymine (T)/cytosine (C) polymorphism in subjects with ACE inhibitor-related cough. We classified the study population into 4 groups: subjects with and without cough that were treated with ACE inhibitors (n=30/30), nontreated essential hypertensive subjects (n=100), and normotensive subjects (n=100). The -58T/C was genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism method. The frequencies of the CC genotype and C allele of -58T/C were significantly higher in the nontreated hypertensive subjects than in the normotensive subjects. Conversely, the frequencies of the TT genotype and T allele were significantly higher in the subjects with cough than in the subjects without cough. These tendencies were more pronounced in females. Among the promoter assays of the human bradykinin B(2) receptor, -58T was found to have a higher transcription rate than that of -58C. This finding seems to suggest that the transcriptional activity of promoter might be involved in the appearance of ACE inhibitor-related cough. A genetic variant of the bradykinin receptor is involved in the elicitation of ACE inhibitor-related cough. It may be possible to predict the side effects of ACE inhibitors in advance.", 
    "645": "We have previously reported that hyperglycemia in healthy human subjects increased the renal vasodilator response to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. This observation raised intriguing possibilities relevant to the pathogenesis of nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus. To ascertain whether the effect of captopril was indeed mediated by a reduction in angiotensin II (Ang II) formation, we performed another study in which an Ang II antagonist, eprosartan, was used in place of captopril. Nine healthy subjects were studied in high sodium balance (ie, sodium intake 200 mmol/d). On the first day, the subjects received 600 mg eprosartan orally, and renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured. Glucose was infused intravenously on the second and third study days to increase plasma glucose to a level below the threshold for glycosuria ( approximately 8.8 mmol/L). Eprosartan at a dose of 600 mg or placebo was administered randomly on the second or third study day 1 hour after initiation of glucose infusion. RPF increased (by 76+/-7 mL. min(-1). 1.73 m(-2), P<0.01) in response to sustained moderate hyperglycemia and then increased further (by 147+/-15 mL. min(-1). 1. 73 m(-2), P<0.01) when eprosartan was administered during hyperglycemia. Eprosartan, conversely, did not affect RPF and GFR in normoglycemic subjects. GFR was not affected by either hyperglycemia or eprosartan. Neither plasma renin activity nor plasma Ang II concentration changed during hyperglycemia, suggesting that the hormonal responses responsible for the enhanced renal vasodilator response to eprosartan occurred within the kidney. The enhancement of the renal vasodilator effect of eprosartan during hyperglycemia is consistent with activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "646": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II) has 2 active domains (N and C) in a single peptide chain. Because we found its N-domain more stable than its C-domain, we investigated the effect of the amino-terminus of human ACE on the C-domain with a molecular construct expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) cells and transiently in HEK293 cells. This active N-deleted ACE contained only the first 141 amino acids of the human N-domain but not its active center and was linked to the active C-domain containing the transmembrane and cytosolic portions of ACE. The CHO cells were also transfected with human B(2) bradykinin receptor. ACE inhibitors (5 nmol/L or 1 micromol/L) augmented bradykinin (100 nmol/L) effects, elevated B(2) receptor numbers, and resensitized the receptor desensitized by agonist as measured by arachidonic acid release or [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization. Arachidonic acid release was mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G alpha(i), and [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization was mediated by pertussis-insensitive G alpha(q) protein receptor complex. The properties of the construct were compared with wild-type ACE and separate N- and C-domains. The N-deleted ACE differed from wild-type in activation by Cl(-) and [SO(4)](2-) ions, hydrolysis ratios of substrates (both short synthetic and endogenous peptides) and heat stability. Thus, the N-terminal peptide of ACE affected the characteristics of the C-domain active center. ACE inhibitors acting on N-deleted ACE, which had only a single C-domain active center anchored to plasma membrane, induced cross-talk between the enzyme and the B(2) receptor (eg, the inhibitors resensitized the receptor) independent of blocking bradykinin inactivation.", 
    "647": "It has previously been reported that hypertension induced by the chronic blockade of NO production is characterized by a proinflammatory phenotype of the arterial wall associated with a periarterial accumulation of inflammatory cells. In the present study, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the luminal and perivascular accumulation of inflammatory cells were evaluated in the aortas of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-treated rats. Because the medial layer remains intact, putative markers of the resistance of the vascular wall to cell migration and to oxidative stress were also explored. For this purpose, monocyte adhesion, cytokine expression, superoxide anion production, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation were assessed in the aortas of L-NAME-treated rats. Expressions of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the aortic wall were also studied as possible markers of such resistance. Chronic blockade of NO production increased ex vivo monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, increased the production of superoxide anions, and activated the NF-kappa B system. In concert with this modification of the redox state of the vascular wall in L-NAME-treated rats, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor was increased. In parallel, expressions of both TIMP-1 and HO-1 were increased. All these changes were prevented by treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (Zofenopril). Hypertension associated with a proinflammatory phenotype of the vascular wall induced by blockade of NO production could be due to an increase in oxidative stress, which, in turn, activates the NF-kappa B system and increases gene expression. In parallel, the arterial wall overexpresses factors such as TIMP-1 and HO-1, which could participate in the resistance to cell migration and oxidative stress.", 
    "648": "1. We compared the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist valsartan in cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced hypertension and nephrotoxicity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. SHR (8 - 9 weeks old) on high-sodium diet were given CsA (5 mg kg(-1)d (-1) s.c. ) for 6 weeks. The rats were treated concomitantly either with enalapril (30 mg kg(-1)d (-1) p.o.) or valsartan (3 or 30 mg kg(-1) d (-1) p.o.). To evaluate the role of bradykinin in the action of enalapril, some rats received a bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist icatibant (HOE 140, 500 microg kg(-1) d (-1) s.c.) during the last 2 weeks of enalapril treatment. 3. Blood pressure was recorded every second week by tail cuff method. Renal function was measured by serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and urinary excretion of proteins at the end of the experiment. The activity of the renal kallikrein-kinin system was estimated by urinary kallikrein excretion. 4. CsA caused hypertension, impaired renal function and induced morphological nephrotoxicity with glomerular damage and interstitial fibrosis. Enalapril and the lower dose of valsartan attenuated the CsA-induced hypertension to the same extent, while the higher dose of valsartan totally abolished it. Icatibant did not reduce the antihypertensive effect of enalapril. Urinary kallikrein excretion was similar in all groups. 5. Enalapril and valsartan equally prevented the CsA-induced deterioration of kidney function and morphology. 6. The renin-angiotensin but not the kallikrein-kinin system plays a crucial role in CsA-toxicity during high intake of sodium in SHR.",

The successive effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP, 2 mg kg(-1)+1 mg kg(-1) 30 min(-1) infusion) and the neutral endopeptidase 24-11 inhibitor retrothiorphan (RT, 25 mg kg(-1)+12.5 mg kg(-1) 30 min(-1) infusion) were studied on femoral vascular conductance (FVC) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ-SD) and control Sprague-Dawley (C-SD) rats. The role of the kinin-nitric oxide (NO) pathway was assessed by (1) using pre-treatments: a bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor antagonist (Hoe-140, 300 microg kg(-1)), a NO-synthase inhibitor (N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, L-NAME, 10 mg kg(-1)), a kininase I inhibitor (DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid, MGTA, 10 mg kg(-1)+20 mg kg(-1) 20 min(-1) infusion) and (2) comparing the effects in STZ-induced diabetic (STZ-BN) and control Brown-Norway kininogen-deficient (C-BN) rats. 2. In C-SDs, CAP and CAP+RT increased FVC similarly. In STZ-SDs, FVC and FBF were decreased compared to C-SDs. CAP+RT increased them more effectively than CAP alone. 3. In both C-SDs and STZ-SDs, the femoral bed vasodilatation elicited by CAP was inhibited by Hoe-140 and L-NAME. The FVC increase elicited by CAP+RT was not significantly reduced by Hoe-140 but was inhibited by L-NAME and Hoe-140+MGTA. 4. In C-BNs, the vasodilatator responses to CAP and CAP+RT were abolished and highly reduced, respectively. In STZ-BNs, these responses were abolished. 5. These results show that in STZ-SDs, CAP+RT improve FBF and FVC more effectively than CAP alone. These effects are linked to an increased activation of the kinin-NO pathway. BK could lead to NO production by BK B2 receptor activation and another pathway in which kininase I may be involved.", 
    "650": "The aspartic proteinase renin plays an important physiological role in the regulation of blood pressure. It catalyses the first step in the conversion of angiotensinogen to the hormone angiotensin II. In the past, potent peptide inhibitors of renin have been developed, but none of these compounds has made it to the end of clinical trials. Our primary aim was to develop novel nonpeptide inhibitors. Based on the available structural information concerning renin-substrate interactions, we synthesized inhibitors in which the peptide portion was replaced by lipophilic moieties that interact with the large hydrophobic S1/S3-binding pocket in renin.", 
    "651": "Crystal structure analysis of renin-inhibitor complexes combined with computational methods were employed in the medicinal-chemistry optimisation process. Structure analysis revealed that the newly designed inhibitors bind as predicted to the S1/S3 pocket. In addition, however, these compounds interact with a hitherto unrecognised large, distinct, sub-pocket of the enzyme that extends from the S3-binding site towards the hydrophobic core of the enzyme. Binding to this S3(sp) sub-pocket was essential for high binding affinity. This unprecedented binding mode guided the drug-design process in which the mostly hydrophobic interactions within subsite S3(sp) were optimised.",

    "653": "Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane (ISO) (1.7% end-tidal concentration) in 40% oxygen, and mechanically ventilated. The animals were bled 15 mL kg-1 b.w. from the femoral vein over 10 min, followed by an observation period of 30 min. Ten minutes before haemorrhage each group of animals was pre-treated with intravenous injection/infusion of either: isotonic saline (Group B; CON; n=7), vasopressin V1-receptor antagonist [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP; 10 microg kg-1] (Group C; AVP-a; n=7), the non-selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin (10 microg kg-1 min-1) (Group D; SAR; n=7) or hexamethonium (10 mg kg-1) (Group E; HEX; n=7). A separate group of conscious animals were pre-treated with isotonic NaCl and subjected to the same haemorrhage protocol (Group A; AW; n=7). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and blood gases were observed during the experiments. Only pre-treatment with SAR and HEX reduced MAP significantly. The pre-haemorrhage HR was only affected by HEX, which caused a reduction by 17%. The HR was significantly lower at the end of haemorrhage compared with pre-haemorrhage levels in all groups except that group treated with HEX. In that group the HR changed in the opposite direction. The ability to maintain MAP during haemorrhage, and the post-haemorrhage period, was significantly impaired in the groups treated with AVP-a, SAR or HEX compared with the group receiving NaCl. It is concluded that autonomic nervous activity is of major importance for the maintenance of MAP during isoflurane anaesthesia, whereas circulating angiotensin II and vasopressin levels contribute to a much smaller degree in this regard. General anaesthesia in combination with different degrees of neurohumoral blockade impairs the haemodynamic responses to blood loss, seen in conscious individuals. The impairment involves both the early and late phases during haemorrhage, as well as the post-bleeding recovery period. All three neurohumoral systems (autonomic nervous activity, angiotensin II and vasopressin) are of importance for regulating MAP during and after haemorrhage, although the autonomic nervous outflow appears to contribute to a larger extent.", 
    "654": "The angiotensin system plays a role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. We used a rat heterotopic tracheal transplant model of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) to examine the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in development of the fibroproliferative lesion of BO. Isograft and allograft tracheal transplants were performed. Allograft rats received either no treatment (control) or captopril (100 mg/kg/d) in their drinking water. The drug treatment given to the recipient rats was begun 5 days before transplantation, on postoperative Day 1, or on postoperative Day 5. The treatment was continued until postoperative Day 21, when tracheal specimens were harvested and subjected to histologic, immunohistologic, and morphometric analyses. We noted heavy staining for ACE in the obliterated portion of the tracheas of allograft control animals. This area was not present in nontransplanted or isograft tracheas. Captopril administration begun 5 d before transplantation and on postoperative Day 1 resulted in a significant attenuation in the percent airway obliteration (45% and 26%, respectively) as compared with that in control allografts (83%; p < 0.05). This study demonstrates the presence of ACE in the fibroproliferative lesion in a rat model of BO, and shows that inhibition of ACE can limit development of airway obliteration.", 
    "655": "Angiotensin II (AT-II)-receptor antagonists are reviewed. Research focused on blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) led to the discovery of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are effective in the treatment of hypertension but are associated with a high frequency of cough and other adverse effects. AT-II-receptor antagonists were developed as agents that would more completely block the RAS and thus decrease the adverse effects seen with ACE inhibitors. AT-II-receptor antagonists include losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, eprosartan, telmisartan, and tasosartan. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that AT-II-receptor antagonists are as effective as calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and induce fewer adverse effects. The adverse effects of AT-II-receptor antagonists--dizziness, headache, upper-respiratory-tract infection, cough, and gastrointestinal disturbances--occur at about the same rate as with placebo. [corrected]. All available AT-II-receptor antagonists seem to be equally effective in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and they are comparable in cost. Currently, AT-II-receptor antagonists are used either as monotherapy in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Angiotensin II-receptor antagonists are well tolerated and are as effective as ACE inhibitors in decreasing blood pressure.",

Serial sections were cut and stained and stereological analysis applied to quantify the morphology of the vessels. Left ventricular (LV) mass was determined. 3. Both SBP and LV mass were significantly increased in GH compared with N (P < 0.001) and increased further in GH given L-NAME (P < 0.05). The GH L-NAME + valsartan and GH L-NAME + enalapril groups had significantly lower (P < 0.001) SBP and LV mass than the GH L-NAME group. 4. Basilar arteries in GH (which are frankly hypertensive, but have no apparent endothelial defect) showed hypotrophic inward remodelling compared with the N control group with no change in media to lumen ratio. 5. In the GH L-NAME group, further inward remodelling occurred and the media to lumen ratio was increased compared with N (P < 0.01) and GH (P < 0.05). Valsartan treatment in GH L-NAME rats caused eutrophic outward remodelling. Enalapril caused hypertrophic outward remodelling, suggesting that the angiotensin II-stimulated growth was not entirely suppressed with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or that there was a bradykinin effect with enalapril. 6. In GH with an endothelial defect induced by treatment with L-NAME, the further remodelling, together with an increased media to lumen ratio and the development of a stroke-like syndrome, indicates the NOS-inhibited GH rat may be a useful model for essential hypertension (where it is known that endothelial abnormalities exist) and where stroke can develop as a consequence of the hypertension.", 
    "670": "The objective of this investigation was to compare changes in antioxidant status (together with other metabolites relevant to hypertension) in plasma and cardiac tissue from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), following 8 weeks of treatment with lisinopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) or amlodipine (Ca(2+) channel antagonist) respectively. There was no significant difference in the levels of total antioxidant capacity, retinol, urea, albumin or triglyceride in plasma from SHR or WKY rats, with or without lisinopril or amlodipine treatment. However in SHR rats, levels of alpha-tocopherol were substantially reduced in both plasma (-54% WKY, P<0.01) and cardiac tissue (-43% WKY, P<0.05). Treatment with lisinopril ameliorated reduced levels of plasma alpha-tocopherol in SHR rats, but not in cardiac tissue. Amlodipine treatment had no effect on alpha-tocopherol levels in plasma or cardiac tissue in SHR rats. In SHR rats total cholesterol levels were significantly lower thanWKY controls (-36%, P<0.001). This effect was reversed in lisinopril treated SHR rats (+27%, P<0.01). Plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were reduced in untreated SHR rats (P<0.025) when compared to WKY controls; neither lisinopril nor amlodipine treatment significantly altered these parameters. These findings suggest possible alternative mechanisms of action for lisinopril, and reinforce its use in hypertensive patients or patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "671": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (kininase II) inhibitors (ACEis) are very widely used to treat cardiac conditions and nephropathies, but some of their beneficial activities cannot be attributed to enzyme inhibition alone. We investigated the effects of ACEis on the human bradykinin (BK) B(2) receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the cDNA of human receptor and ACE, and on human pulmonary endothelial cells that constitutively express both proteins. BK and its ACE-resistant peptide analog activated the B(2) receptor to release arachidonic acid and elevate [Ca(2+)](i) and subsequently desensitized it. The release of arachidonic by BK was independent of extracellular Ca(2+). BK enhanced phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated B(2) receptor but enalaprilat significantly reduced it. ACEi resensitized the receptor by initiating a cross talk between the receptor and ACE. Protein kinase C and phosphatase inhibitors distinguished the signaling by the receptor when activated first by BK from BK acting on the resensitized receptor. Treatment of cells with 1 microM calphostin, 100 nM staurosporine, 100 nM calyculin, or 500 nM okadaic acid did not affect either one of the primary actions of BK on the receptor. Protein kinase C or phosphatase inhibitors, however, blocked the effects of BK on the receptor resensitized by enalaprilat or ramiprilat. The experiments clearly differentiate the primary activation of the receptor by BK from activation of the resensitized receptor after ACEi treatment. The existence of an intermediate component involved in the action of ACEis to enhance release of vasoactive mediators by BK is suggested.", 
    "672": "To determine the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the upregulation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) observed in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension, the selective ET-1 type-A receptor (ET(A)) antagonist ABT-627 was chronically administered to normal controls and hypertensive rats. Chronic ET(A) blockade in DOCA-salt-treated rats prevented the increase in blood pressure and circulating natriuretic protein (NP) levels and partially prevented left ventricular hypertrophy. The changes observed in NP gene expression in the atria were not affected by ABT-627. In the ventricles, ABT-627 reduced NP gene expression. Rats receiving the ET(A) antagonist alone showed reduced left ventricular NP gene expression. ABT-627 did not affect ventricular collagen III gene expression but enhanced left ventricular alpha-myosin heavy chain expression. These findings suggest that in vivo, ventricular but not atrial NP production is regulated by ET-1. This difference in response between atrial and ventricular NP gene expression to ET(A) receptor blockade is similar to that observed by us after applying angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in other hypertensive models. In general therefore, atrial NP gene expression may not be as sensitive to the endocrine environment as is ventricular NP gene expression.", 
    "673": "BACKGROUND-Chronic heart failure (CHF) impairs the endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of small arteries. However, whether chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition affects the impairment of FMD in CHF is unknown. We investigated the effects of long-term ACE inhibition on the FMD of peripheral arteries in rats with CHF and the mechanism(s) involved. METHODS AND RESULTS-FMD was assessed in isolated, perfused gracilis muscle arteries from sham-operated, and untreated or ACE inhibitor-treated (perindopril 2 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) for 10 weeks) rats with CHF (coronary artery ligation). The role of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and free radicals was assessed by pretreating the vessels with the NO synthase inhibitor N(W)-nitro-L-arginine, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac, or the free radical scavenger N-2-mercaptopropionyl-glycine (MPG). Endothelial NO synthase mRNA expression was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In animals with hemodynamic and echographic signs of CHF, FMD was converted into vasoconstriction, and this was prevented by ACE inhibition. FMD of arteries from sham-operated or ACE inhibitor-treated CHF rats was abolished by N(W)-nitro-L-arginine. In untreated CHF rats, FMD was increased by diclofenac and MPG. In contrast, in arteries from ACE inhibitor-treated rats, neither diclofenac nor MPG affected FMD. In parallel, ACE inhibition prevented the reduction of endothelial NO synthase mRNA by CHF. CONCLUSIONS-In CHF, ACE inhibition normalized NO-dependent dilatation and suppressed the production of vasoconstrictor prostanoid(s), resulting in improved FMD. The improvement of FMD might contribute to the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition during CHF.",

    "677": "Both beta-blockers caused similar decreases in heart rate and LVEDP compared with untreated post-MI rats. At equivalent beta-adrenoceptor blocking doses, however, carvedilol, but not metoprolol, attenuated the increase in collagen content in noninfarcted regions and prevented the increase in right ventricular weight/body weight (all p < 0.05), and its effect was similar to captopril. Metoprolol treatment tended to increase right ventricular weight and heart weight (p < 0.05). There were no differences in infarct size between the groups.", 
    "678": "Long-term treatment with both beta-blockers, as well as an ACE inhibitor, benefited the healing process in rats post-MI.

    "684": "Chronic renal failure is a self-perpetuating, progressive disease leading to end-stage renal failure, even if primary insult to the kidneys was removed. Progressive course of disease is caused by chronic interstitial inflammation leading to fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and glomerular sclerosis. Main predictive risk factors of the disease progression include: proteinuria, systemic and glomerular hypertension. It is presumed that in most cases progressive course of the disease is related to genetic predisposition to greater activity of renin-angiotensin system. Among attempts to slow progressive course of the disease effective are interventions acting on renin-angiotensin system, endothelin 1 and on profibrotic cytokines. Role of dietary factors and potential treatment modalities are discussed.", 
    "685": "In two patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) different effects of angiotensin convertase inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (AT1B) were observed. In patient 1 with CRF due to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), with arterial hypertension (HT) and proteinuria, a switch from AT1B to ACEI led to significant deterioration of renal function. After restitution of AT1B, renal function returned to previous range. The 2nd patient with CRF and severe HT, without proteinuria, due to atypical HUS, was on CAPD. Because of severe HT he received 3-4 hypertensives and ACEI in full dose was the main medication. Despite relatively low urea and creatinine values while on dialysis and high residual diuresis several attempts an end of CAPD was unsuccessful because of hyperkalemia and unacceptable increase of urea and creatinine concentrations after few days. Conversion from ACEI to AT1B enabled withholding CAPD, stabilisation of renal function and good control of HT. It seems that in patients with CRF without hyperfiltration syndrome and sensitive to changes in glomerular hemodynamics, in whom blockade of angiotensin action is needed AT1B may be a better option than ACEI. When using ACEI in patients with CRF, it is important to adjust the dose to renal function.",

The authors present an unusual case of haematuria and deterioration of renal function caused by cystine stones in a child with anaphylactic purpura. This 6 year old girl was hospitalized because of severe gastrointestinal symptoms in the course of a typical Henoch-Schoenlein syndrome. After 4 weeks of illness--the child demonstrated haematuria and oliguria with severe loin pain and a rise in serum creatinine to 5.8 mg%. Urine findings of mainly non-glomerular erythrocytes and slight proteinuria were suggestive of a non-glomerular cause of renal failure. Ultrasound examination revealed the unexpected finding of bilateral kidney obstruction caused by multiple renal stones. Cystine crystals observed under microscopic examination of the urinary sediment and a positive cyanide-nitroprusside test suggested cystinuria as the cause of nephrolithiasis. High water intake and alkalization of urine and captopril for cystine excretion reduction resulted in fast improvement of renal function and and with time complete dissolution of calculi. The symptoms of Henoch-Schoenlein syndrome resolved over several weeks, and the child did not develop any signs of glomerular involvement.", 
    "687": "Trandolapril is a newly developed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) whose characteristic is that it undergoes hepatic excretion. ACEI appears to have a specific reno-protective and antiproteinuric role in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis(CGN). Although renally excreted ACEI tend to accumulate and cause side-effects in patients with renal dysfunction, the pharmacokinetics of trandolapril were not affected by renal dysfunction. We compared the effect of other renally excreted ACEI with those of trandolapril on serum creatinine (s-Cr), creatinine clearance(Ccr), proteinuria and total protein(TP) in CGN patients who switched from another ACEI to trandolapril. Twelve hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure(nine males and three females, ranging from 30 to 72 years of age) who were treated by other renally excreted ACEIs for long periods(2 to 8 years) with some effects on proteinuria and renal function, were enrolled in the present study. After ACEI therapy, s-Cr had decreased(2.09 to 1.80 mg/dl, p < 0.01) as well as proteinuria(1.65 to 0.71 g/day, p < 0.01). A single daily oral dose of 1 mg of trandolapril was administered to these patients regardless of their blood pressure status and renal functions. After change to trandolapril therapy, s-Cr(2.25 to 2.06 mg/dl, p < 0.01) and urinary protein(1.82 to 1.34 g/day, p < 0.05) significantly decreased. On the contrary, both Ccr and TP significantly increased at the level of 39.4 to 44.4 ml/min(p < 0.05) and 6.80 to 7.02 g/dl (p < 0.01), respectively. No apparent side effects, such as hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, anemia or worsening of the existing renal dysfunction except for coughing, were observed in these patients. Furthermore, none of the 12 patients treated with trandolapril required discontinuation of the compound. In conclusion, it was shown from this study that trandolapril is effective for the treatment of hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency irrespective of the original diseases. Thus, it can be envisaged that trandolapril is one of the most appropriate agents compared to other renally excreted ACEI for these patients with renal insufficiency. We recommend the change from other ACEIs to trandolapril, when renal dysfunction might be due to ACEI accumulation.", 
    "688": "The involvement of central angiotensinergic and cholinergic mechanisms in the effects of the intracerebroventricularly injected somatostatin analog octreotide (Oct) on drinking, blood pressure, and vasopressin secretion in the rat was investigated. Intracerebroventricular Oct elicited prompt drinking lasting for 10 min. Water consumption depended on the dose of Oct (0.01, 0.1, and 0. 4 microgram). The drinking response to Oct was inhibited by pretreatments with the intracerebroventricularly injected angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, the AT(1)/AT(2) angiotensin receptor antagonist saralasin, the selective AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan, or the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist atropine. The dipsogenic effect of Oct was not altered by prior subcutaneous injection of naloxone. Oct stimulated vasopressin secretion and enhanced blood pressure. These responses were also blocked by pretreatments with captopril or atropine. Previous reports indicate that the central angiotensinergic and cholinergic mechanisms stimulate drinking and vasopressin secretion independently. We suggest that somatostatin acting on sst2 or sst5 receptors modulates central angiotensinergic and cholinergic mechanisms involved in the regulation of fluid balance.",

Because angiogenesis is key to wound healing, we hypothesized that captopril would impair wound healing. We hypothesized also that because local application at operation of Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (SaPG) increases angiogenesis and accelerates wound healing in rats, SaPG would prevent or ameliorate the postulated captopril-impaired wound healing.",

All ate chow and drank ad libitum, pre-operatively (4-12 days) and postoperatively (7 days). In experiments 1 and 2, bilateral paravertebral 5.5-cm skin incisions were made aseptically (intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital), and closed with interrupted No. 35 stainless-steel sutures. On one side, the wound was immediately inoculated with 157 microliter pyrogen-free isotonic saline and on the other side the wound was inoculated with 157 microliter saline containing 4.7 mg SaPG (860 microgram SaPG/cm incision). In the third experiment, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sponges (16-17 mg dry wt each) containing either 50 microliter saline or 0.5 mg SaPG in 50 microliter saline were implanted subcutaneously, two on each side, via 1-cm incisions closed with a single suture.

In experiment 3, subcutaneous PVA saline-inoculated sponge reparative tissue hydroxyproline (OHP) content was similar in control and captopril-treated rats, and SaPG inoculation increased reparative tissue OHP significantly in both groups: 2458 +/- 218 microgram/100 mg dry sponge vs 3869 +/- 230 microgram/100 mg (P < 0.001) (controls) and 2489 +/- 166 microgram/100 mg vs 4176 +/- 418 microgram/100 mg (P < 0.001) (captopril-treated rats). Histologically, angiogenesis and reparative tissue collagen were similar in control and captopril-treated rats, in both saline-inoculated and SaPG-inoculated sponges. In experiment 4 (all incisions and subcutaneous PVA sponges were saline-inoculated), there was no significant difference in WBS between control and captopril-treated rats (107 +/- 6 g vs 96 +/- 5 g, NS). PVA sponge reparative tissue OHP was significantly higher in captopril-treated rats: 3698 +/- 170 microgram/100 mg dry sponge vs 2534 +/- 100 microgram/100 mg (P < 0.0001).",

    "697": "Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is a model of renal injury characterized by progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis and renal damage, while relatively sparing the glomerulus and not producing hypertension or abnormalities in lipid metabolism. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a major component of several kidney diseases associated with the progression to end-stage renal failure. Here we report that when a critical renal developmental morphogen, osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1; 100 or 300 microg/kg body wt), is administered at the time of UUO and every other day thereafter, interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis are prevented, leading to preservation of renal function during the first 5 days after obstruction. Compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril treatment, OP-1 was more effective in preventing tubulointerstitial fibrosis and in preserving renal function. The mechanism of OP-1- induced renal protection was associated with prevention of tubular atrophy, an effect not shared with enalapril, and was related to preservation of tubular epithelial integrity. OP-1 blocked the stimulation of epithelial cell apoptosis produced by UUO, which promoted maintenance of tubular epithelial integrity. OP-1 preserved renal blood flow (RBF) during UUO, but enalapril also stimulated RBF. Thus OP-1 treatment inhibited tubular epithelial disruption stimulated by the renal injury of UUO, preventing tubular atrophy and diminishing the activation of tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis and preserving renal function.", 
    "698": "We have previously shown that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is localized to the cortical thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (cTALH)/macula densa of the rat kidney, and expression increases in response to low-salt diet and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Because of the localization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to macula densa and surrounding cTALH, the present study investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the regulation of COX-2 expression. For in vivo studies, rats were fed a normal diet, low-salt diet or low-salt diet combined with the ACE inhibitor captopril. In each group, one-half of them were treated with the nNOS inhibitors 7-nitroinidazole (7-NI) or S-methyl-thiocitrulline. Both of these NOS inhibitors inhibited increases in COX-2 mRNA and immunoreactive protein in response to low salt and low salt+captopril. For in vitro studies, COX-2 expression was studied in primary cultures of rabbit cTALH cells immunodisssected with Tamm-Horsfall antibody. Basal COX-2 immunoreactivity expression was stimulated by S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP), an NO donor, and intracellular cGMP concentration. The cultured cells expressed immunoreactive nNOS, and 7-NI inhibited basal COX-2 immunoreactivity expression, which could be partially overcome by cGMP. In summary, these studies indicate that NO is a mediator of increased renal cortical COX-2 expression seen in volume depletion and suggest important interactions between the NO and COX-2 systems in the regulation of arteriolar tone and the renin-angiotensin system by the macula densa.", 
    "699": "Drugs grouped into a therapeutic class on the basis of a common mechanism of action often have considerably different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Among angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, differences with potential clinical relevance include potency, whether the drug is an active compound or requires metabolic activation, lipophilicity, route(s) of elimination, and half-life. Large clinical trials have documented the clinical benefits of several ACE inhibitors in various patient populations, and many clinical effects of ACE inhibitors are likely to be the same. However, there are possible quantitative differences among ACE inhibitors that may alter the overall therapeutic benefits for specific patient populations and indications. Equipotency in terms of clinical efficacy is difficult to determine. Since the concept of \"class effect\" is a term of convenience that has no universally accepted definition and subsequently should not form the basis for the practice of evidence-based medicine, untested drugs of a \"class\" should be considered to be unproven drugs.", 
    "700": "Therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is established for reducing excessive blood pressure, reducing mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), preventing the development of CHF in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and preventing death and CHF when initiated early after the onset of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Although these benefits have been attributed largely to hemodynamic mechanisms, recent preclinical and clinical evidence reveal ACE inhibition as potent in preventing ischemic events and in blocking an array of ischemic processes, including atherogenesis. A major contributor to this new evidence is the large, placebo-controlled Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial, which found that the ACE inhibitor ramipril ( 10 mg daily) prevented MI and other ischemic events in patients with a broad range of cardiovascular (CV) risks (including coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes plus one additional risk factor) but no LV dysfunction or history of heart failure at baseline. The data from the HOPE trial suggest a greatly expanded role for ramipril in the prevention and management of CV disease.", 
    "701": "Ischemic heart disease is the principal etiology of heart failure in the Western world. Myocardial ischemia is important in cardiac remodeling, a process that leads to a progressive change in the shape and size of the heart and significantly worsens the prognosis of patients with heart failure. Preventing ischemic events, therefore, is an important goal in the management of patients with coronary artery disease. Statins have been shown to reduce the number of ischemic events in these patients, whereas the benefit of beta-blocker and aldosterone antagonist therapy on ischemic causes of heart failure remains unclear. Several large trials involving patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction or heart failure have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the incidence of progressive heart failure, death, and ischemic events, thus establishing ACE inhibitors as first-line therapy for these patients. Other lines of evidence have suggested that ACE inhibitor therapy may also benefit patients with preserved left ventricular function, a hypothesis that is being evaluated in three large, controlled, randomized trials. One of these trials, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, was terminated prematurely because it demonstrated the significant positive effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function. A growing body of data confirms the relationship between ischemia and heart failure and the benefits of ACE inhibitor treatment in a broad range of high-risk patients.",

An orthostatic decline in SBP of > or = 10 mm Hg occurred in 13 patients, and there was a drop of > or = 20 mm Hg in six patients. The cross-over of enalapril and nifedipine reproduced the hypotensive effect and reversed the postural effect. (P = .0002 nifedipine vs enalapril)", 
    "709": "Enalapril and nifedipine were equipotent in reducing supine blood pressure levels. Enalapril also reduced the number of orthostatic episodes significantly, whereas nifedipine aggravated this phenomenon.", 
    "710": "A chronic diuretic abuse is common among healthy young women. An acute cessation of diuretic intake causes renal sodium retention with formation of edema due to diuretic-induced secondary hyperaldosteronism. Therefore, diuretics should be tappered over weeks or even months in these patients. Other clinical situations where therapy with diuretics is potentially deleterious are pregnancy and systemic sclerosis. In pregnant women, diuretic-induced acute or chronic depletion of the plasma volume can lead to placental hypoperfusion and preeclampsia. Patients with systemic sclerosis have very high levels of blood renin. Diuretic-induced volume depletion provides another stimulus of the renin-angiotensin system and may cause a rapidly progressive renal failure requiring dialysis within days or weeks. The sclerodermal renal crisis is associated with a high early mortality. There is evidence that sclerodermal renal crisis can be avoided when patients are treated with an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.", 
    "711": "During treatment with low to moderate doses of thiazides or loop diuretics, hypokalemia is dose-dependently demonstrated in 2-11% of patients. Additional hypomagnesemia is present in about 40% of hypokalemic patients. High doses of diuretics were routinely used in the past for treatment of hypertension or heartfailure, causing ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Low-dose thiazides +/- potassium-sparing diuretic are not associated with these severe adverse effects, but improve in contrast (to high-dose diuretics) survival and cardiovascular morbidity in hypertensive patients. Higher doses of diuretics often necessary in the treatment of patients with severe heart failure are today no longer regularly associated with hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia because of the concomitant treatment with an ACE inhibitor and low-doses of spironolactone.", 
    "712": "Chronic heart failure is associated with excessive neurohormonal activation. Analysis of heart rate variability is considered a valid technique for assessment of the autonomic balance of the heart. Twenty symptomatic patients of dilated cardiomyopathy in NYHA class II-IV symptomatic status and as many normal controls were subjected to 24 hours Holter monitoring to assess the heart rate variability with both time domain and frequency domain analysis. Age of the patients ranged from 12 to 67 years (mean +/- SD 38.6 +/- 7 years), the male-female ratio was 4:1. The left ventricular ejection fraction of the patients was between 18-42 percent (mean +/- SD 30.2 +/- 9%) and all received diuretics, digoxin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Heart rate variability parameters measured included mean heart rate with standard deviation, hourly heart rate with SD and the mean of all normal RR intervals from the 24-hour recording. Time domain measures calculated were SD of all normal RR intervals, SD of 5 minute mean RR intervals and root mean square of difference of successive RR intervals. Using spectral plots, frequency domain subsets of low frequency and high frequency were analysed and expressed in normalised units. Total power was also measured. In the dilated cardiomyopathy patients, mean 24-hour heart rate in beats per minute was significantly higher in comparison to controls (82 +/- 13 vs 72 +/- 8; p < 0.001) whereas mean hourly heart rate with standard deviation (msec) was significantly lower (97 +/- 41 vs 232 +/- 25; p < 0.001), SD of all normal RR intervals (msec) was 85.5 +/- 26.3 vs 139.4 +/- 16.9 in controls (p < 0.001), SD of 5 minute mean RR intervals (msec) was also significantly less in patients in comparison to controls (75.8 +/- 39.6 vs 130.8 +/- 20.3; p < 0.001). However, although root mean square of difference of successive RR intervals (msec) was reduced in patients (30.1 +/- 9.3 vs 37.3 +/- 11.7; p < 0.05), the difference was non-significant. Low frequency power (0.05-0.15 Hz) (normalised units) was reduced in the dilated cardiomyopathy group (0.0721 +/- 0.003 vs 0.136 +/- 0.047 in the control group; p < 0.001). High frequency power (0.35-0.50 Hz) (normalised units) (0.08 +/- 0.05 in patients vs 0.09 +/- 0.02 in controls; p > 0.1) and total power frequency (0.02-0.50 Hz) (normalised units) (0.34 +/- 0.05 in patients vs 0.35 +/- 0.12 in controls; p > 0.1) was non-significantly different in the two groups. Regression analysis showed a significant decrease in SD of all normal RR intervals, SD of 5 minute mean RR intervals, low frequency, high frequency, total power and a non-significant decrease in root mean square of difference of successive RR intervals with a decrease in ejection fraction percent whereas there was a significant decrease in SD of all normal RR intervals, SD of 5 minute mean RR intervals, low frequency and total power and a less significant decrease in root mean square of difference of successive RR intervals and high frequency power with an increase in NYHA class. At 6 months duration, 6 patients were lost to follow-up, 3 patients were readmitted (2 for congestive cardiac failure, one of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). One patient who was NYHA class IV at baseline was readmitted for congestive cardiac failure and showed much lower heart rate variability parameters compared to the average of the patients. We conclude that in symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, heart rate variability parameters are significantly reduced in comparison to control subjects.", 
    "713": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme is present in the male reproductive system but its role in the physiology of reproduction is not known. To see the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme on spermatozoal functions, lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered orally using two different doses (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) to rats. Both short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (6 weeks) effects of the drug were observed. Lisinopril treatment resulted in a marked decrease in sperm density, sperm motility and zona pellucida penetration. Acrosome reaction by spermatozoa obtained from drug-treated animals was significantly lower when compared with spermatozoa from normal animals.", 
    "714": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been avoided as an initial therapeutic option in the treatment of hypertension in African-Americans. A major reason for this has been the widespread perception of clinicians that these agents have poor blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy in this population. Remarkably uniform and pervasive interpretations of clinical trial data have formed the basis of this clinical perception and can be summarised as follows: (1) there has been a lesser BP lowering effect of ACE inhibitors in African-Americans compared to whites, particularly at low doses; and (2) short-acting ACE inhibitors like captopril prescribed at the midpoint of its maximal total daily dose lower BP less effectively than higher doses of calcium antagonists in African-Americans. A reinterpretation of published data from these same clinical trials suggests that: (1) the majority of African-Americans have meaningful BP responses to ACE inhibitors, albeit at a higher average dose than in whites; and (2) high levels of dietary sodium intake appear to explain a significant portion of the racial differences in BP response at the lower doses of ACE inhibitors. Thus, ACE inhibitors can effectively lower BP in African-Americans. These data suggest that the clinician should not avoid these agents in African-Americans because of a presumed lack of BP lowering efficacy. Rather, we should recognise the importance of adequate drug dosing and modest reductions in dietary sodium intake in augmenting the BP lowering effect of ACE inhibitors in hypertensive African-Americans.", 
    "715": "Severe hypertension is a common clinical problem in the United States, encountered in various clinical settings. Although various terms have been applied to severe hypertension, such as hypertensive crises, emergencies, or urgencies, they are all characterized by acute elevations in BP that may be associated with end-organ damage (hypertensive crisis). The immediate reduction of BP is only required in patients with acute end-organ damage. Hypertension associated with cerebral infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage only rarely requires treatment. While nitroprusside is commonly used to treat severe hypertension, it is an extremely toxic drug that should only be used in rare circumstances. Furthermore, the short-acting calcium channel blocker nifedipine is associated with significant morbidity and should be avoided. Today, a wide range of pharmacologic alternatives are available to the practitioner to control severe hypertension. This article reviews some of the current concepts and common misconceptions in the management of patients with acutely elevated BP.", 
    "716": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme is involved in apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells (Wang R, Zagariya A, Ang E, Ibarra-Sunga O, and Uhal BD. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 277: L1245-L1250, 1999). This study tested the ability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or the caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD-fmk) to block alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and lung fibrosis in vivo in response to bleomycin (Bleo). Male Wistar rats received 8 U/kg of Bleo (bleomycin sulfate) or vehicle intratracheally. Subgroups of Bleo-treated rats received captopril, ZVAD-fmk, or vehicle alone. Lung collagen was assessed by picrosirius red or hydroxyproline assay at 1, 7, and 14 days post-Bleo, and apoptosis was detected by in situ end labeling (ISEL). Bleo increased alveolar septal and peribronchial collagen by 100 and 133%, respectively (both P < 0.01), by day 14 but not earlier. In contrast, ISEL was increased in alveolar and airway cells at all time points. Captopril or ZVAD-fmk inhibited collagen accumulation by 91 and 85%, respectively (P < 0. 01). Both agents also inhibited ISEL in alveoli by 99 and 81% and in airways by 67 and 63%, respectively. These data suggest that the efficacy of captopril to inhibit experimental lung fibrogenesis is related to inhibition of apoptosis. They also demonstrate the antifibrotic potential of a caspase inhibitor."
