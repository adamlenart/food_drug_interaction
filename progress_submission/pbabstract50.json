The following parameters were estimated: mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Blood pressure was measured directly in the carotid artery, heart rate was counted according to ECG, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were calculated using the method of human 125J albumin dilution. For statistical analysis, the average change in the examined parametres was calculated. Indomethacin significantly increased mean arterial pressure without altering other hemodynamic parameters. Combined intravenous administration of indomethacin with enalaprilat or propranolol abolished hypotensive effect of both drugs. Indomethacin magnified the effect of propranolol on total peripheral resistance and abolished the effect of enalaprilat on this parameter. Co-administration of indomethacin with propranolol or enalaprilat did not influence significantly heart rate and cardiac output in comparison with the effect of both antihypertensive drugs alone. This may indicate the predominant role of the influence of indomethacin on vascular tone in the observed interaction.", 
    "1": "The liquid membrane phenomenon in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors namely, captopril and lisinopril has been studied. Hydraulic permeability data have been obtained to demonstrate the existence of the liquid membrane in series with a supporting membrane generated by the ACE inhibitors. Data on the transport of the relevant permeants in presence of the liquid membrane formed by ACE inhibitors indicate that liquid membrane phenomenon is likely to play a significant role in the action of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "2": "Mounting evidence suggests that increased circulating aldosterone levels, despite angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors therapy, may exert deleterious cardiovascular effects in heart failure, leading to clinical deterioration and poor prognosis. In the past decades, a number of experimental investigations have provided major insight into the mechanism(s) of action and the biological effects of aldosterone on the cardiovascular system, indicating that aldosterone participates in the structural and functional remodeling of cardiac and vascular tissue. In particular, it has emerged that aldosterone plays a key role in the regulation of myocardial extracellular matrix composition and endothelial function with important pathophysiological implications. Such evidence, coupled with the recent beneficial effects of spironolactone, a competitive aldosterone receptor antagonist, in reducing cardiac mortality and morbidity in patients with severe chronic heart failure treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and loop diuretics, highlights the importance of aldosterone in the pathophysiology of human heart failure. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the regulation of aldosterone production and metabolism in heart failure, the basic mechanism of aldosterone action, and the pathophysiological implications of aldosterone in heart failure, and to discuss recent evidence supporting the efficacy of aldosterone receptor blockade in the treatment of chronic heart failure in humans.", 
    "3": "The main causes for acute renal failure (ARF) in the newborn include endogenous factors (such as hypotension, hypovolemia, hypoxemia, perinatal asphyxia, and neonatal septicemia) and exogenous factors such as mechanical ventilation, nephrotoxic agents (antibiotics, indomethacin, ibuprofen, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and tolazoline). These conditions determinate vasoactive disturbances interfering with the delicate balance of intrarenal vasoconstrictor and vasodilator forces, which regulates the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the healthy term, and particularly in the premature infant. Factors influencing renal prognosis are the severity of the underlying disorder, the rapidity of an accurate diagnosis, prompt treatment, and avoidance of severe iatrogenic complications. Plasma creatinine concentrations should be used with some caution for ARF diagnosis in the first days of life. General measures of kidney protection include correcting abnormalities in fluid homeostasis, adequate ventilation and rational choice of drugs. Moreover, in order to protect the kidney, different compounds have been proposed such as diuretics (furosemide and torasemide), and dopaminergic agents (dopamine, dopexamine). With the increasing knowledge of the mechanisms governing the development of ARF, progress has been made in the development of new treatment modalities. For example theophylline, calcium antagonists, ATP-MgCl2, thyroxine, and antibodies against endothelin may in the near future be used to prevent or ameliorate the prognosis of the neonatal stressed kidney. The main renal replacement therapies are possible in the newborn. However preventive measures are easily available in the neonatal period and they often represent the most efficacious procedures.", 
    "4": "Calcium antagonists represent an important group of drugs for the treatment of hypertension; they are effective in the whole range of severity of the disease. Dihy- dropyridine derivatives are most frequently used, and can be used in association with other antihypertensive drugs; meanwhile phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepines are contraindicated in association with beta-blocker drugs. Calcium antagonists with slow starting effect and long duration of action are the choice for use in long-term antihypertensive treatment. This group of drugs is specially indicated in elderly patients, in those with diabetes mellitus and in patients with coronary heart disease. Phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepine derivatives are also used in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. This group of agents is as safe as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors and beta-blocking drugs in the long-term treatment of hypertension.", 
    "5": "Nitric oxide (NO) is the principal vasoactive substance produced by the vascular endothelium with antitrombotic, antiatherogenic and vasodilator actions. The loss of these functions is now known as endothelial dysfunction (ED) and it has been proposed that it is the final common pathway in cardiovascular disease. At the moment there is an important body of evidence that supports the proposal that ED is a consequence of an imbalance between the free radicals, NO, superoxide (O(-)(2)) and peroxynitrate (ONOO(-)). This imbalance is the result of the actions of well known risk factors associated with an inappropriate diet and infection-inflammation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are highly effective against a variety of cardiovascular disorders. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect of ACE inhibition on endothelial function. This action is mainly due to an increase in the concentration of bradykinin, which stimulates NO production. ACE inhibitors also block the formation of angiotensin II that results in a lower production of O(-)(2). These effects lead to improve the imbalance between NO and O(-)(2) observed in cardiovascular disease. This proposal is supported by different clinical trials that have shown that the ACE inhibitors with higher affinity by the tissular ACE, such as quinapril, are the most effective in reversing ED principally by accumulating bradykinin. Recently, the HOPE study conducted in patients at a high risk of cardiovascular events, showed how ramipril, an ACE inhibitor with high affinity by tissular ACE, decreased the mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease independently of changes in blood pressure.", 
    "6": "Angiotensin II receptor blockers represent a class of effective and well tolerated orally active antihypertensive drugs. Activation of AT(1) receptors leads to vasoconstriction, stimulation of the release of catecholamines and antidiuretic hormone and promote growth of vascular and cardiac muscle. AT(1) receptor blockers antagonise all those effects. Losartan was the first drug of this class marketed, shortly followed by valsartan, irbesartan, telmisartan, candesartan, eprosartan and others on current investigation. All these drugs have the common properties of blockading the AT(1) receptor thereby relaxing vascular smooth muscle, increase salt excretion, decrease cellular hypertrophy and induce antihypertensive effect without modifying heart rate or cardiac output. Most of the AT(1) receptor blockers in use controlled blood pressure during the 24 h with a once-daily dose, without evidence of producing tolerance to the antihypertensive effect and being with low incidence of side effects even at long term use. Monotherapy in mild-to-moderate hypertension controls blood pressure in 40 to 50% of these patients; when a low dose of thiazide diuretic is added, 60-70% of patients are controlled. The efficacy is similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, calcium antagonists and beta-blocking agents. AT(1) receptor blockers are specially indicated in patients with hypertension who are being treated with ACE inhibitors and developed side effects such as, cough or angioedema. The final position in the antihypertensive therapy in this special population and other clinical situations, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and renal disease, has to be determined in large prospective clinical trials, some of which are now being conducted and seem promising.", 
    "7": "This paper describes the effect of angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the electrical properties of the heart, particularly the effect of these drugs on heart cell coupling and impulse propagation and the possible implications for the generation of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The hyperpolarising action of enalapril is described and evidence is presented that the activation of the sodium-potassium pump is involved in the increment in membrane potential elicited by the ACE inhibitor.", 
    "8": "The present study was carried out to assess whether endogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) supports sympathetically mediated cardiovascular response to stress in conscious unrestrained rats, using experimental models in which the renin-angiotensin-system was reduced or blocked. Footshock-stress increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme with captopril or blockade of AT(1)angiotensin receptor with losartan, attenuated vasopressor responses to footshocks, while heart rate response was not altered. Bilateral nephrectomy suppressed vasopressor response as well the elevation of plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline induced by footshocks, and reduced heart rate response. Cardiovascular response to stress in nephrectomised rats was restored by exogenous administration of a subpressor dose of Ang II. Our results demonstrate that in conscious rats cardiovascular response to footshocks is dependent on an active renin-angiotensin system and they indicate that endogenous Ang II supports the sympathetically mediated vasopressor response to footshocks.", 
    "9": "Microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion equal to 30-300 mg/24 h) is a reliable indicator of premature cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients and in the general population. In insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus microalbuminuria is a marker of initial diabetic nephropathy and predicts the evolution toward renal insufficiency. In essential hypertension the clinical and prognostic role of microalbuminuria is more controversial. While it is a recognised marker of cardiovascular complications and a reliable predictor of ischaemic heart disease, its prognostic value on the risk of progressive renal alterations is still uncertain because no prospective studies, taking microalbuminuria as a selection criterion and renal insufficiency as an end point, are available. Blood pressure control with antihypertensive drugs is accompanied by a reduction in urinary albumin excretion. The favourable effects of antihypertensive agents on microalbuminuria appear to be proportional to blood pressure reduction, but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists show an additional beneficial effect on urinary albumin excretion. Whether the reduction of microalbuminuria obtained through pharmacological intervention has favourable prognostic implications remain to be demonstrated. However, screening for microalbuminuria is a relatively easy and inexpensive procedure and reveals a potentially treatable abnormality. Thus, considering that microalbuminuria identifies hypertensive subjects at higher risk than standard, urinary albumin excretion should be routinely measured in hypertensive patients and, in the presence of microalbuminuria, antihypertensive treatment should be intensified in order to obtain an optimal blood pressure control.", 
    "10": "Hypertension, including isolated systolic hypertension, is one of the major risk factors for stroke and coronary heart disease in elderly subjects, and is a common antecedent of heart failure, because it increases the risk either directly through increased after-load or indirectly as a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction. The proportion of people aged 65 and above is increasing. It is well documented that hypertension treatment in elderly patients reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality more than could be expected from the results of trials in middle-aged subjects. Most of the trials on old and new antihypertensive drugs have yielded similar results. Nevertheless, evidence in subjects above 80 years of age is still limited. Hypertension (systolic-diastolic) and isolated systolic hypertension should be treated in elderly patients, starting with low doses of medication, particularly diuretics alone or in combination with beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Isolated systolic hypertension could also be treated with a long-acting calcium antagonist starting with low doses. The large therapeutic studies, because of the limitations imposed upon conclusions by the selection and exclusion criteria, by the statistical techniques that established the trial designs and by other study-related constraints, cannot be applied to all elderly patients seen in daily practice. Specifically patients may differ in age, severity of illness, presence of morbidity and a myriad of other clinical nuances. Non-pharmacological measures such as lifestyle modifications (losing weight, limiting alcohol intake, reducing sodium intake and exercise), should be instituted or improved if they existed, to maximise the benefit and minimise the risk inherent in pharmacological treatment. A medical approach may reconcile the results of these large therapeutic studies with 'real life' quality of life and patients' preferences in order to improve treatment compliance.", 
    "11": "The endothelium plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Endothelial function is attenuated by the presence of different well known cardiovascular risk factors. Evaluation of endothelial vasodilator function serve as an index integrating the overall stress imposed by cardiovascular risk factors and reinforce the suggestion that endothelial dysfunction is an early marker of cardiovascular disease that precedes clinical manifestations. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to reduce the cardiovascular mortality, an effect that could be the consequence of an improvement in the endothelial function. Recent studies have shown that a calcium antagonist might improve the endothelial function, however, there is controversy about this action and also about the potential mechanisms for the effect of a calcium antagonist in the regulation of endothelial function.", 
    "12": "Salt sensitivity is regarded as an important contributor to the higher risk of hypertension in black people as compared with whites. This finding is in agreement with a better response to diuretics than to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in black subjects. It is important to remember that the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitor is augmented in patients on a thiazide diuretic. Moreover, the antihypertensive response to a specific drug varies among black patients. Thus, ACE inhibitors should also be viewed as important options to treat hypertensive black subjects. Results from clinical trials support an emphasis on lifestyle modification and a more intensive blood pressure lowering by pharmacological interventions to reduce the large black-white gap in cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) attributed to hypertension.", 
    "13": "Diastolic heart failure is defined clinically when signs and symptoms of heart failure are present in the presence of preserved left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction >45%). The incidence and prevalence of primary diastolic heart failure increases with age and it may be as high as 50% in the elderly. Age, female gender, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and increased body mass index are risk factors for diastolic heart failure. Hemodynamic consequences such as increased pulmonary venous pressure, post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, and secondary right heart failure as well as decreased cardiac output are similar to those of systolic left ventricular failure, although the nature of primary left ventricular dysfunction is different. Diagnosis of primary diastolic heart failure depends on the presence of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Assessment of diastolic dysfunction is preferable but not mandatory. It is to be noted that increased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide does not distinguish between diastolic and systolic heart failure. Echocardiographic studies are recommended to exclude hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, infiltrative heart disease, primary valvular heart disease, and constrictive pericarditis. Myocardial stress imaging is frequently required to exclude ischemic heart disease. The prognosis of diastolic heart failure is variable; it is related to age, severity of heart failure, and associated comorbid diseases such as coronary artery disease. The prognosis of severe diastolic heart failure is similar to that of systolic heart failure. However, cautious use of diuretics and/or nitrates may cause hypotension and low output state. Heart rate control is essential to improving ventricular filling. Pharmacologic agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are used in selected patients to decrease left ventricular hypertrophy. To decrease myocardial fibrosis, aldosterone antagonists have a potential therapeutic role. However, prospective controlled studies will be required to establish their efficacy in primary diastolic heart failure.", 
    "14": "We sought to determine whether reperfusion and the calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, during healing over six weeks after myocardial infarction (MI), limit structural vascular remodeling in the noninfarct zone (NIZ).", 
    "15": "The effect of reperfusion and amlodipine or enalapril on structural vascular remodeling during healing of MI has not been determined.", 
    "16": "We randomly assigned 54 dogs to reperfused or nonreperfused MI, followed by twice-daily doses of oral placebo, amlodipine (5 mg) or enalapril (5 mg) for six weeks and three days off treatment, or to three matching sham groups. We measured in vivo hemodynamic data and left ventricular (LV) function and remodeling (by echocardiography) over the six weeks, as well as ex vivo structural vascular, ventricular and collagen remodeling in the hearts after six weeks.", 
    "17": "Compared with placebo and sham groups, both amlodipine and enalapril with or without reperfusion produced LV unloading and limited structural LV remodeling and dysfunction over six weeks in vivo, and also decreased the NIZ resistance vessel media/lumen area ratio at six weeks ex vivo. In addition, amlodipine, but not enalapril, preserved infarct scar collagen and increased the border zone collagen volume fraction and perivascular fibrosis, as well as NIZ resistance vessel media thickness. Enalapril, but not amlodipine, decreased transforming growth factor-beta in the border zone and NIZ.", 
    "18": "The results indicate that therapy with amlodipine and enalapril during healing after reperfused MI limits structural vascular remodeling in the NIZ, probably by different mechanisms.", 
    "19": "1. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the regulation of vascular natriuretic peptide receptors (NPR) is related to the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS). 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive to activate and inhibit the RAS, respectively. Another model of hypertension was induced by treatment with an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, namely NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). 3. The mRNA expression of NPR-A, NPR-C, angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin AT1 receptors was determined in the thoracic aorta by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The particulate guanylyl cyclase activity stimulated by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was also determined in the membrane fraction of the thoracic aorta. 4. The plasma concentrations of ANP were increased significantly in the three models of hypertension. Plasma renin activity was increased in 2K1C hypertension, decreased in DOCA-salt hypertension and not significantly altered in L-NAME hypertension. 5. The mRNA expression of NPR-A and NPR-C was decreased, whereas that of ACE and AT1 receptors was increased in 2K1C and L-NAME hypertension. The mRNA expression of NPR-A and NPR-C was increased, whereas that of ACE and AT1 receptors was decreased in DOCA-salt hypertension. 6. The particulate guanylyl cyclase activity was decreased in 2K1C and L-NAME hypertension and increased in DOCA-salt hypertension. 7. The vascular expression of NPR may be reciprocally regulated by local RAS activity.", 
    "20": "Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in Westernised societies. It is well known that the aetiology of this devastating disorder involves both genetic and environmental factors. Sequence variants of the components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the kallikrein-kinin system are suggested to have significant influences on cardiovascular homeostasis. Both gene targeting and transgenic studies in mice have clearly suggested a critical role of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene in blood pressure regulation. Furthermore, an up-regulation of myocardial ACE gene expression has been observed in patients with heart failure. Thus, the ACE gene has been recognised as a top candidate gene for cardiovascular research. Over the past decade, the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of a 287-bp Alu element in intron 16 of the ACE gene has attracted significant attention and has been extensively investigated in a spectrum of cardiovascular phenotypes, because of its correlation with serum ACE activity. A large majority of previous studies have shown a positive association between the DD genotype and an increased risk of myocardial infarction, but results in hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy and restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty remain quite controversial. Since ACE inhibitors are widely used in hypertension and congestive heart failure, we also review the literature on the relationship of ACE I/D polymorphism with ACE inhibitor response. It appears that this polymorphism has some moderate impact on the cardiovascular response to ACE inhibitors but there is no consensus as to which allele confers a more pronounced effect. In addition, previous data are suggestive of an association between the ACE I allele and a greater risk of increased occurrence of ACE inhibitor-induced cough, but such a relationship needs further confirmation. Overall, since ACE I/D is only an intronic marker, the true locus that controls the ACE enzyme activity remains to be identified, and could be located within either the ACE gene or another nearby gene such as the human growth hormone gene. We note that since associations tend to vary across different gender or ethnic groups, or across different socio-ecological settings, consideration of potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions should be made. Furthermore, the dissection of the genetic underpinning of cardiovascular disease needs delineation of all molecular variants of the key physiological pathways that influence cardiovascular function.", 
    "21": "(1) The 22nd French pharmacovigilance meeting, held in July 2001, presented data on adverse effects notified by health professionals to regional pharmacovigilance centres in France. (2) Non specific \"immunostimulants\" are not harmless placebos, as might be concluded from the relative lack of data. There have been 315 notifications of severe adverse effects, some with positive rechallenge, reporting cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, haematological and other disorders. Attributability was considered \"likely\" in 68% of cases. Three deaths occurred. (3) Other well known adverse effects continue to occur: convulsions with camphor, visual hallucinations with oxybutynin, headache with antimigraine drugs, liver damage with dextropropoxyphene, neuropsychological disorders after buflomedil overdose (especially in patients with renal failure), hyperkalaemia during spironolactone combination with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), and severe infections after intravesical BCG. (4) Rare adverse effects of old drugs were identified, such as oedema with valproic acid, interstitial pneumonia with flecainide, and a bleeding risk due to tramadol interaction with oral anticoagulants. (5) The adverse effects of new drugs are better documented: celecoxib is now implicated in visual disorders. (6) Overall, the meeting confirmed that only a small proportion of adverse drug reactions are notified, that a large number of hospitalised patients suffer from drug induced complications, and that summaries of product characteristics (SPC) are often too brief or reassuring regarding pharmacovigilance data. The poor risk-benefit ratios of some drugs call for their immediate market withdrawal.", 
    "22": "The Fisher to Lewis (F-L) model of renal transplantation (Rtx) is widely used. Rtx from F to L without immunosuppressive treatment results in 50% survival, whereas L to F results in survival rates similar to syngrafts. When treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or antihypertensive triple therapy, renal damage is markedly reduced in F-L allografts. Despite similar reductions in blood pressure, the ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) is more effective than antihypertensive triple therapy, suggesting that the inhibition of intrarenal ACE plays an additional role in the attenuation of renal damage.", 
    "23": "In the present study, we investigated strain-related differences in intrarenal ACE activity between F and L rats and whether treatment with ACE-I in F-L allografted rats results in reduction of intrarenal ACE. Intrarenal ACE was measured by activity assays, immunohistochemistry and PCR.", 
    "24": "In control kidneys from healthy F rats (n=8), we found a four-fold higher ACE activity than in native L rats (n=8, p<0.01). This was confirmed by a three-fold difference in ACE mRNA expression (n=5 for both, p<0.01). Using immunohistochemistry, we found strong tubular ACE expression in the F rat, whereas the L rat had no tubular ACE at all. In F-L allografts (n=9) we noted significant glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria after 34 weeks. Treatment with ACE-I in F-L (n=8) prevented the development of these changes. Although ACE mRNA and ACE protein expression were similar in treated and untreated allografts, intrarenal ACE activity was reduced by 50% in allografts with ACE-I.",

    "34": "Hyperglycaemia-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been observed in normal and diabetic humans. Our main objective was to determine whether the mechanism involved a physical or metabolic effect of glucose. First, Sprague-Dawley rats of the CD strain were given sequential intravenous (i.v.) doses of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg candesartan 30 minutes apart, in the presence of a continuous i.v. infusion of dextrose 20% in water (D20W). The 0.1 mg/kg dose produced a maximal renal blood flow (RBF) response and was used thereafter. Another set of animals then received an infusion of either normal saline (NS), dextrose 5% in water (D5W) or dextrose 20% in water (D20W) for 2 hours, followed by candesartan 0.1 mg/kg i.v. Finally, the response to candesartan 0.1 mg/kg i.v. during D20W infusion was compared with that during infusion of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), a glucose analogue that competitively inhibits the glycolytic enzyme, hexokinase. RBF (electromagnetic flowmeter), blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, and urine glucose were monitored. There was no significant RBF response to candesartan on either NS (6.01 to 0.48 to 6.20 to 0.49 ml/minute/g kidney; p=0.216) or D5W (7.63 to 1.20 to 7.58 to 1.39 ml/minute/g kidney; p=0.965), whereas there was a significant response to D20W (6.64 to 0.59 to 7.46 to 0.67 ml/minute/g kidney; p=0.002). The RBF response was significantly enhanced by D20W compared with 2DG (change in RBF: 0.82 to 0.22 vs. -0.04 to 0.26; p=0.05), despite similar BP, blood glucose, and urine glucose. Glucose acts, at least in part, through intracellular utilisation to induce RAS activation, as manifested by an enhanced renal vascular response to an angiotensin II antagonist.", 
    "35": "This study in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) was designed to determine whether a greater fall in blood pressure (BP) could be achieved with the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and an AT(1)-receptor blocking drug than with higher doses of either drug alone. The peak effect of captopril occurred 3 4 hours post-dose and a plateau response was achieved with 10 mg/kg. The peak effect of losartan occurred 7 8 hours post-dose and a plateau response was achieved with 10 mg/kg. Increasing the dose of either drug caused no greater fall in BP, but increased the duration of the effect. Captopril, 10 mg/kg, administered with losartan 10 mg/kg caused a greater fall in BP than captopril or losartan, 20 mg/kg. This was present after acute doses or after one week of daily therapy. The combination of ACE-I and AT(1)-blocking drugs is more effective than either therapy alone and may be a useful combination to manage hypertension and/or cardiac failure.",

To date, however, no antiangiogenic agent has become widely available for the clinical setting. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly used as antihypertensive agents and it has recently been suggested that they decrease the risk of cancer. Studies have found that an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, is a potent inhibitor of experimental tumor development and angiogenesis at a clinically comparable dose. The potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is significantly suppressed by perindopril and also inhibits VEGF-induced tumor growth. In vitro studies showed that perindopril is not cytotoxic to either tumor cells or endothelial cells. Since perindopril is already in widespread clinical use without serious side effects, it may represent a potential new strategy for anticancer therapy.",

    "41": "There is a unique relationship between the kidney and blood pressure (BP): on the one hand, renal dysfunction and particularly renal disease cause an increase in BP, while on the other hand, high BP accelerates loss of function of the diseased kidney. Transplantation studies, both in experimental animals and humans, documented that \"blood pressure goes with the kidney,\" a normotensive recipient of a kidney genetically programmed for hypertension (HT) will develop HT, while conversely hypertensive patients with renal failure receiving the kidney of a normotensive donor may develop normotension. Family studies showed higher BP values and more frequent HT in first degree relatives of patients with primary glomerulonephritis or diabetic nephropathy, both type 1 and type 2. The notion that HT accelerates the loss of renal function has been proposed at the turn of the century, but definite evidence by observational and interventional studies has only been provided in the last two decades. The issue has been much confounded by the mistaken believe that damaged kidneys require higher BP values in order to function properly. The mechanisms of BP increase in renal disease comprise: salt retention, inappropriate activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and of the sympathetic nerve system as well as impaired endothelial cell-mediated vasodilatation. There is ample evidence both in primary renal disease (AIPRI and REIN trials) and in nephropathy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (IDNT, RENAAL) that pharmacological blockade of the RAS by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers has BP-independent renoprotective effects. More recently, it has also been shown that blockade of the sympathetic nerve system has BP-independent effects on albuminuria and on glomerulosclerosis.",

As residual proteinuria is associated with a poor renal outcome, identification of its determinants is important. We found previously that the systemic sequelae of proteinuria enhance renal damage in untreated nephrotic rats. The impact of systemic nephrosis on renal therapy response, however, is unclear. In the present study we therefore investigated whether the severity of systemic nephrosis, estimated from plasma cholesterol, predicts residual proteinuria during ACE inhibition.", 
    "43": "Sixty male Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis were studied. Six weeks after the induction of nephrosis, rats were stratified for proteinuria and treated for 2 weeks with lisinopril (75 mg/l) or vehicle.", 
    "44": "At the start of treatment, median proteinuria was 744 mg/day (95% confidence interval (CI) 609-860) and plasma cholesterol was 10.4 mmol/l (95% CI 8.0-12.6), reflecting the state of systemic nephrosis. Lisinopril, but not vehicle, reduced blood pressure and proteinuria (-62%; range -70 to -48; P<0.001). Residual proteinuria was 275 mg/day, with a wide range (47-1119 mg/day). Pre-treatment proteinuria and pre-treatment cholesterol correlated positively with residual proteinuria. By multivariate analysis (r(2) of model =0.92), both pre-treatment cholesterol and pre-treatment proteinuria were independent predictors of residual proteinuria. The quantitative impact of this multivariate analysis is illustrated by the difference in residual proteinuria between rats with a cholesterol:proteinuria ratio less than, compared with greater than, the median (residual proteinuria 298 mg/day (CI 129-496) vs 439 mg/day (CI 158-670), respectively). Blood pressure response was not predicted by the tested predictor variables.",

Kidneys of Fisher rats were orthotopically grafted to Lewis rats. Untreated 'Fisher-to-Lewis' allografts served as controls (TX). All animals received low-dose cyclosporin A (1.5 mg/kg body weight) for 10 days post-transplant to inhibit early acute rejection episodes. The duration of the experiment was 36 weeks. Blood pressure (BP) was measured every other week by tail plethysmography. Indices of glomerulosclerosis (GS), tubulointerstitial and vascular damage, number of glomeruli, total glomerular volume and mean glomerular volume were measured using morphometric and stereological techniques, respectively. Albuminuria, blood chemistry and haematology were measured at the end of the experiment.",

However, only ACE inhibition inhibits glomerular hypertrophy. In contrast to ACE inhibition, the effect of ET(A)-receptor blockade is independent of BP. This finding is consistent with the notion that ET(A)-receptor mediated events play a partly BP-independent role in the genesis of CTN. Combination therapy exerts no additive nephroprotection.",

Before and after losartan treatment the patients were examined using echocardiography, radiocardiography with 131-I albumin, occlusion plethysmography, 131-I hippuran clearance. CPBP was estimated by the change in circulation flow rate in the forearm in low body rarefaction by means of low pressure camera. Losartan was given in maximal tolerance dose (25-100 mg/day). Examination in the end of the treatment demonstrated diminished venous tone, increased blood flow in the forearm, reduced volume of circulating plasm, elevated hematocrit, higher ratio of early to late filling peaks of the left ventricle, progression of baroreflex dysfunction. Thus, long-term losartan treatment promoted improvement in peripheral vascular tonicity, diastolic function of left-ventricular myocardium, reduction in circulating plasm volume, progression of baroreflex dysfunction.",

Adult patients with a minimum of two claims with a valid congestive heart failure diagnosis from 1997 to 1999 were included. Patients receiving continuous carvedilol treatment for at least 4 months were considered study case patients. Case patients were matched based on age, gender, race, and concomitant medication. Healthcare use and costs were compared between the case and control groups. A total of 128 case and 147 control patients were identified. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics, concomitant medication, or New York Heart Association classification between these two groups. Analysis of variance and chi-square analyses were conducted for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Statistical adjustments were made using a multivariate model. Carvedilol had a significant economic reduction in the overall expenditures by approximately $14,530. Facility expenditures were approximately $9,000 lower for the carvedilol group than for the control group. Carvedilol-treated patients had less frequent hospital admissions and shorter lengths of stay compared with patients not receiving carvedilol.

    "56": "Childhood hypertension necessitates a careful approach to diagnosis and a tailored approach to management. Hypertension in children should not be considered a rare condition. The diagnosis of hypertension must be assessed carefully, with attention to age, sex, and height standards. Also, careful attention should be given to the methods used to measure blood pressure. Once the diagnosis is made and the underlying etiologies have been evaluated and managed as necessary, both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to treatment have been used. Nonpharmacologic approaches, especially weight reduction and increased physical activity, are beneficial. If pharmacologic approaches are needed, the goal of therapy should be to reduce blood pressure below the 95th percentile in the easiest, most effective manner that causes the fewest side effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, alpha and beta blockers, and diuretics have all been used in children. Newer antihypertensives, such as angiotensin receptor blockers, are now being tested.", 
    "57": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors represent a new class of cardiovascular drugs. They function as a combined angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, the latter of which potentiates the actions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) by minimizing its degradation in the circulation. The consequence of such dual inhibition is a synergistic reduction of vasoconstriction and enhancement of vasodilation, thereby serving to more effectively reduce blood pressure. Furthermore, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) prevents physiologic compensatory responses in vivo seen with NEP inhibition alone. Vasopeptidase inhibitors have also shown to potentiate bradykinin and adrenomedullin, which additionally contribute to cardiovascular regulation. The most extensively researched and promising agents within the class of VP inhibitors is omapatrilat, a mercaptoacyl derivative of a bicyclic thiazepinone dipeptide. It is a single molecule with equal potency and affinity for ACE and NEP inhibition. Although ACE inhibition tends to more selectively benefit high-renin models of hypertension, vasopeptidase inhibition has been shown to be equally efficacious in low-, normal-, and high-renin models. Contrary to NEP inhibition alone, omapatrilat has also demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, the equivalent of essential hypertension in humans. Studies also suggest that omapatrilat has cardioprotective properties, especially in the setting of congestive heart failure. More specifically, animal models have demonstrated omapatrilat to be more effective than ACE inhibition alone in remodeling the heart and improving its contractile function. Human studies have documented the efficacy of omapatrilat in the treatment of both hypertension and, to a lesser extent, heart failure. Safety concerns (specifically angioedema) are currently being addressed before the widespread utilization of this promising new agent.",

Though much study is still required, bradykinin augmentation represents an exciting new target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "59": "The purpose of the present study was to identify angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in bovine ovarian follicular fluid and to relate the ACE activity to the phase of the oestrous cycle, pregnancy, and the follicular fluid concentrations of oestradiol and progesterone. The ACE activity was similar to that found in bovine serum and was completely inhibited by the specific ACE inhibitor captopril. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 1.4 x 10(-8) mol/l (range 0.8 x 10(-8) to 5.0 x 10(-8) mol/l; n=6), which is similar to that found in bovine and human serum. The ACE activity did not differ in the pre-ovulatory and luteal phase, pregnancy or cystic follicles. It correlated with the follicular fluid concentration of progesterone in cycling cows (rho=0.476; p < 0.005; n=36), but did not correlate with the diameter of the follicles, the follicular fluid concentration of oestradiol or the ratio between the oestradiol and progesterone concentrations. The demonstration of ACE in bovine ovarian follicular fluid provides further evidence for the presence of a local renin-angiotensin system in the bovine ovary.",

    "64": "Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful and independent predictor of an adverse prognosis in patients with heart disease and in the general population. The HRV is largely determined by vagally mediated beat to beat variability, conventionally known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Thus, HRV is primarily an indicator of cardiac vagal control. It is still unclear whether the relationship between measures of cardiac vagal control and mortality is causative or mere association. Possible mechanisms by which cardiac vagal activity might beneficially influence prognosis include a decrease in myocardial oxygen demand, a reduction in sympathetic activity and a decreased susceptibility of the ventricular myocardium to lethal arrhythmia. In animals, augmentation of cardiac vagal control by nerve stimulation or by drugs is associated with a reduction in sudden death in susceptible models. In humans a number of drugs which have been shown to reduce mortality and sudden death in large randomised trials can also be demonstrated to increase HRV. As a result of this evidence, it has been suggested that the effect of drugs or other therapeutic manoeuvres on HRV might be used to predict clinical efficacy. The use of HRV as a therapeutic target is discussed in this review.",

This article will present treatment recommendations designed to delay the progression of chronic renal disease, to optimize its medical management and to reduce complications induced by renal insufficiency including hypertension, renal osteodystrophy and anemia.

    "69": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the restoration of endothelial function by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition based on the severity of hypertension. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured in 69 patients with essential hypertension (mild, n = 23; moderate, n = 29; and severe, n = 17 randomly assigned to treatment with either imidapril or amlodipine for 24 weeks in a double-blind fashion during reactive hyperemia and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin. Imidapril augmented the FBF response to reactive hyperemia after 24 weeks of treatment in the mild and moderate hypertensive groups, but not in the severe hypertensive group. The augmentation of the FBF response to reactive hyperemia induced by imidapril was significantly greater in the moderate hypertensive group than in the mild hypertensive group. Amlodipine did not alter the FBF response to reactive hyperemia. The increase in FBF after the sublingually administered nitroglycerin was similar in all groups. The infusion of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, abolished the enhancement of reactive hyperemia in the mild and moderate hypertensive groups treated with imidapril. These findings suggest that the effects of imidapril on endothelial function are affected by the severity of hypertension and that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced augmentation of reactive hyperemia may be due to increased nitric oxide production.", 
    "70": "Previously, we reported that high glucose enhanced cytokine-induced nitric oxide (NO) production by rat mesangial cells (MCs), and that the enhanced expression of the iNOS pathway may promote extracellular matrix accumulation by MCs. The present study was designed to examine whether the iNOS pathway is pathologically altered in experimental diabetic nephropathy, and whether therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (imidapril: I) or angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1) blocker (L-158,809: L), ameliorates these changes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with diluent (control: C) or streptozotocin. At sacrifice after 4, 8 and 12 weeks, rats underwent either a 4 hour placebo or an intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2 mg/kg) challenge. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary protein excretion (UPE) increased significantly in diabetic (D) rats compared with C. The basal expression of glomerular iNOS mRNA was increased in D rats compared with that of C rats, by reverse- transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas there was no significant difference in the level of protein by Western blot analysis. Upon LPS stimulation, the iNOS mRNA and protein expression was significantly elevated in D rats. In D rats, this up-regulation, of LPS-stimulated iNOS expression, was equally ameliorated both by I and L in mRNA and protein levels. From immunohistochemistry (IHC), there was a negative staining for the iNOS within the glomeruli of five C rats without LPS treatment, but one of four rats, with LPS treatment, showed minimal iNOS staining in the glomeruli. In D rats, the glomerular mesangium and podocytes were positive for iNOS in each of three out of five rats with, and without, LPS treatment. In conclusion, LPS-stimulated glomerular iNOS expression was enhanced in diabetic pnephropathy, and the activation of angiotensin II may play a role in this enhancement.",

The basic therapeutic procedures include influencing of the arrythmogenic substrate and modulating factors associated with the development of tachyarrhythmias by revascularization of the myocardium and radiofrequency ablation; as to drugs in particular by administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and in rare instances by the application of other surgical methods. Haemodynamically important ventricular arrhythmias are treated by antiarrhythmics (beta-blockers, amiodarone, sotalol) and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

Serum ACE activity in the captopril-treated diabetic patients was 101.5+/-42.5 nmol/mL/min, values obtained in untreated diabetic patients (101.4+/-25.2 nmol/mL/min). In contrast, ACE activity in the enalapril-treated patients was significantly reduced (5.5+/-7.5 nmol/mL/min) compared with untreated and captopril-treated patients (p<0.00001). PRA values in the ACE-I treated patients were significantly increased. Plasma Ang II levels were significantly increased in the captopril-treated vs. untreated patients (65.1+/-50.2 vs. 36.2+/-31.7 pg/mL, p=0.006), whereas the values in the enalapril-treated patient were slightly, but not significantly, reduced (23.8+/-21.4 pg/mL).

    "75": "The prerequisite of atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, is characterised by impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation caused by the reduced bioavailibility of nitric oxide (NO). In order to assess the role of acute ACE inhibition in this setting, coronary arterial endothelial function was quantified following acute intracoronary administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril. Twenty-one patients with non-limiting coronary artery disease were studied before and after acute intracoronary administration of 10 mg quinapril. Nine patients received pre-treatment with the angiotensin AT(1)-receptor antagonist losartan (2 x 50 mg, p.o.). Coronary cross-sectional diameter was measured via quantitative angiography and microvascular reaction was investigated by intracoronary Doppler flow measurement during intracoronary infusion of 0.1 to 10 micromol/l acetylcholine. Quinapril acutely improved endothelial dysfunction on the macro- as well as the microvascular level. Losartan did not alter macrovascular function but facilitated microvascular endothelial function. Acute quinapril application led to no further improvement of endothelial dysfunction in patients pre-treated with losartan. Acute quinapril infusion improved endothelial function in patients with coronary heart disease. Treatment with the AT(1)-receptor antagonist losartan led to a slight improvement in microvascular endothelial function, but pre-treatment with losartan blunted the vascular effect of quinapril, suggesting that the combination of ACE inhibition and AT(1)-receptor antagonism may not exert a synergistic benefical impact on the coronary vasculature.", 
    "76": "Poor glycaemic control and high blood pressure are two important risk factors for the development of retinopathy and nephropathy in Type 1 diabetes. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may be involved in this process, since treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors postpones the development of these complications. We investigated whether plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) differed in Type 1 diabetic patients compared with healthy controls. We recruited 80 patients with Type 1 diabetes of more than 10 years' duration and 75 age-matched controls. We found that PRA and Ang II concentrations were significantly lower in patients than in the controls. The levels of ANP, on the other hand, were higher in patients than in controls. PRA correlated negatively to the mean value of HbA(1c) during the previous five years. PRA and Ang II were significantly lower in patients with mean HbA(1c) >8.4% compared with those with mean HbA(1c) <7.2%. In summary, we found patients with Type 1 diabetes to have RAAS suppression and increased ANP levels, suggesting a state of fluid retention.",

Presence of vimentin, desmin, factor VIII, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and ACE was checked with both immunostaining and Western blotting.

TGF-beta(1) induced an increase in both ACE activity and ACE protein (detected by immunoblotting) by 4.5 +/- 0.9- and 6.9 +/- 2.0-fold, respectively (p<0.05). This induction of ACE was accompanied by a profound modification of the fibroblasts phenotype, which consisted of a change in cell morphology, an enlargement of cell volume and an increase in cell protein content. TGF-beta(1) profoundly inhibited (3)H-thymidine incorporation and the number of cells in growing cultures. The induction of alpha-smooth muscle actin by TGF-beta(1) (6.8 +/- 2.8-fold increase, p<0.05) simultaneously with these modifications in cell morphology and proliferation indicates the appearance of myofibroblasts.

    "81": "Since the original discovery of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) nearly 20 years ago and the subsequent realisation of the existence of a family of natriuretic peptides, there has been considerable progress in the elucidation of the physiological and pathophysiological significance of these peptides. This review has examined two potentially important practical aspects arising from natriuretic peptide research - the significance of measurement of plasma levels of ANP and of brain natriuretic peptide BNP for cardiovascular disease and the therapeutic potential of targeting the natriuretic peptide system. Several situations where the measurement of plasma ANP and BNP may be of benefit in the overall assessment and prognosis of cardiac disease have been discussed. The measurement of plasma levels of these peptides appears to have limited value as a specific diagnostic tool and is unlikely to replace well-established procedures to assess cardiac function. Nevertheless, given the strong negative predictive value, the value of the measurement of plasma natriuretic peptides particularly BNPs, in people with suspected heart disease, rests on the evidence that a normal value indicates a low risk of cardiac impairment. Moreover, a consistently elevated plasma level of BNP after myocardial infarction is associated with a distinctly poor prognosis. In turn, this may help to select those with high plasma levels for subsequent detailed investigation of cardiac dysfunction. This may be an important option, especially where the facilities for the more invasive cardiological procedures are not available. Intriguingly, recent research also suggests the possibility that plasma levels of natriuretic peptides may have an important role in guiding more effective therapy for heart failure. The potent cardiovascular and renal effects of ANP and BNP provide an important therapeutic potential for hypertension and for conditions associated with volume overload. A number of approaches which have been used to enhance endogenous activity of these peptides have been highlighted. The use of the native peptides ANP and BNP may well be valuable in some circumstances, such as in critically ill individuals with congestive heart failure or renal failure. However, the limitations of the use of peptides, especially for long-term treatment, are obvious. In view of this, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of orally active agents to enhance endogenous natriuretic peptides by inhibition of breakdown by neutral endopeptidase. This research has led to the development of vasopeptidase inhibitors - dual inhibitors of both endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme - to enhance endogenous natriuretic peptide function on a background of reduced angiotensin II activity. The broad spectrum of action and the potentially important target-organ protection of these inhibitors offer potential benefits which may well go beyond existing treatment of hypertension and of conditions associated with overt volume overload.", 
    "82": "Constitutive angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is bound to endothelial cells where it serves to regulate circulating concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) that normally contribute to circulatory homeostasis. Recruitable ACE, bound to macrophage and myofibroblast cell membrane, regulates local concentrations of Ang II involved in tissue repair. De novo generation of Ang II modulates expression of TGF-beta1 whose autocrine/paracrine properties regulate collagen turnover at sites of fibrous tissue formation that appear in response to various forms of injury in diverse tissues. Persistent myofibroblasts and their ACE activity at the infarct site contribute to a sustained metabolic activity that can account for a progressive fibrosis at, and remote to, sites of myocardial infarction. Activation of the circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with sustained elevations in plasma Ang II and aldosterone induce a pro-inflammatory vascular phenotype of small arteries and arterioles. This further promotes the appearance of recruitable ACE bound to macrophages and myofibroblasts involved in vascular remodelling. Locally produced Ang II from these vascular sites leads to perivascular fibrosis of intramural coronary vasculature of non-infarcted myocardium. At these sites, remote to the infarct, such adverse structural remodelling by fibrous tissue eventuates in ICM, a major aetiologic factor involved in the appearance of chronic cardiac failure and contributes to its progressive nature.", 
    "83": "There is increasing evidence to suggest endothelial dysfunction as a critical factor in vascular diseases. Genetically predisposed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, develop a severe hypertensive nephrosclerosis without the necessity for surgical reduction in renal mass, nephrectomy, renal infarction or nephrotoxic drugs. In these animals, endothelial dysfunction is considered a valid model for assessment of the efficacy of cardiovascular therapy. SHR were treated with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or the angiotensin II (Ang II) AT(1)-receptor antagonist (AIIA) valsartan at sub-hypotensive doses and the effects on survival rates, cardiac and renal changes were monitored. Rats treated with valsartan, alone or in combination with enalapril, showed markedly higher survival rates (67-85%, respectively) than untreated animals (37%) or those treated with enalapril alone (55%). Valsartan at a dose which attenuated blood pressure increase led to even greater survival rates (95%). Despite these improved survival rates, at non-hypotensive doses the drugs had no effect on histological appearance, nor was kidney function improved. Plasma creatinine levels were reduced by valsartan, alone or in combination with enalapril, but proteinuria persisted with all treatments over the 12 weeks of the study. Aldosterone levels were significantly reduced by all treatments. The results suggest a beneficial role for endothelium in hypertension. Reduced renal perfusion pressure probably underlies the beneficial renal effects of high-dose valsartan.", 
    "84": "Is heart failure an endocrine disease? Historically, congestive heart failure (CHF) has often been regarded as a mechanical and haemodynamic condition. However, there is now strong evidence that the activation of neuroendocrine systems, like the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system, as well as the activation of natriuretic peptides, endothelin and vasopressin, play key roles in the progression of CHF. In this context, agents targeting neurohormones offer a highly rational approach to CHF management, with ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists and beta-adrenergic blockade improving the prognosis for many patients. Although relevant improvements in clinical status and survival can be achieved with these drug classes, mortality rates for patients with CHF are still very high. Moreover, most patients do not receive these proven life-prolonging drugs, partially due to fear of adverse events, such as hypotension (with ACE inhibitors), gynaecomastia (with spironolactone) and fatigue (with beta-blockers). New agents that combine efficacy with better tolerability are therefore needed. The angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1))-receptor blockers have the potential to fulfil both these requirements, by blocking the deleterious cardiovascular and haemodynamic effects of angiotensin II while offering placebo-like tolerability. As shown with candesartan, AT(1)-receptor blockers also modulate the levels of other neurohormones, including aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Combined with its tight, long-lasting binding to AT(1)-receptors, this characteristic gives candesartan the potential for complete blockade of the RAAS-neurohormonal axis, along with the great potential to improve clinical outcomes.", 
    "85": "As with many large-scale long-term outcome trials, more questions have been posed than answered regarding the potential role of angiotensin II receptor blockers as first-line agents in chronic heart failure. Given the present data, in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitors must remain the treatment of choice, owing to the large body of data supporting their use in this clinical syndrome. However, ARBs seems a reasonable alternative for renin-angiotensin axis blockade in the significant number of heart failure patients who are genuinely intolerant of ACE inhibitors. The pendulum has now swung back in favour of ACE inhibition for chronic heart failure, although one can only await with great expectation the results of the ongoing trials comparing not only angiotensin II receptor blockers with ACE inhibitors but a combination of the two with regards tolerability and survival. Whether this potentially useful class of drugs will ultimately become the cornerstone of heart failure therapy in place of, or in addition to, ACE inhibitors is still in debate, but hopefully we should not have to wait too long for the definitive answers.", 
    "86": "The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study was designed to test the hypotheses that two preventive intervention strategies, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or vitamin E, would improve morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events compared with placebo. This review addresses the ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) (ramipril) arm of the study, both on the trial population as a whole, and on the large diabetic subgroup. Patients were included in the study who were considered to be at high risk of future fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events, by virtue of their age (>55 years), existing or previous cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. Diabetics had at least one other risk factor, either known vascular disease or other factors such as cigarette smoking, high cholesterol or hypertension. Ramipril or placebo was added to concomitant medication, which included, in a substantial proportion of patients, antihypertensive drugs (excluding ACE-I), lipid-lowering agents or aspirin. As a result, despite a history of hypertension in nearly 50% of patients, blood pressure (BP) at baseline was normal and the reduction in BP attributable to ramipril modest (a fall of 3-4 mmHg systolic BP and 1-2 mmHg diastolic). The trial was stopped early on the advice of the Data Monitoring Committee because of convincing evidence of the benefit of ramipril treatment on the combined primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarct (MI) and non-fatal stroke (14% vs. 17.8% on ramipril and placebo, respectively; relative risk reduction 22%, p<0.001). This comprised a risk reduction of 32% for stroke, 20% for MI, 26% for cardiovascular death and 16% for all-cause mortality, as well as a reduction in the risk of several other endpoints including heart failure and revascularisation procedures. The results among the 3577 diabetic subjects were even more striking, with a reduction of 25% in the combined primary endpoint. This reduction in the combined endpoint and in particular the reduction in MI far exceeded that which would be expected from the modest fall in BP. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis of the diabetic subgroup showed similar relative risk reductions even after allowing for the effects of the fall in BP. Possible explanations for the non BP-mediated benefits of ramipril include reduction of angiotensin II-induced intimal and vascular smooth muscle proliferation and possible plaque stabilisation. The HOPE study results show that it is both safe and beneficial to lower BP that is already within the 'normal' range, particularly in patients with known vascular risk factors. This should greatly extend the use of ACE-I to a wider group of patients - not only those with left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension or diabetic microalbuminuria, but to the sort of high-risk patients who are currently given prophylactic treatment with aspirin.", 
    "87": "Despite recent improvements in drug therapy, the prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF) continues to rise, as a result of the increasing proportion of older people in the population and factors such as greater survival rates after myocardial infarction. More effective management strategies for CHF are therefore needed urgently. The angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1))-receptor blockers might contribute to such strategies, offering placebo-like tolerability and showing promise in early trials of their use in CHF. Large-scale outcome studies, currently underway, will provide further evidence of the value of AT(1)-receptor blockers in CHF. In addition, the involvement of specially trained nurses in patient education and monitoring should enhance compliance with both existing and novel therapies, and thus help to increase the overall efficacy of holistic strategies for CHF management.", 
    "88": "Primary aldosteronism is a disorder with hypertension, hypokalemia, increased plasma aldosterone, and suppressed renin activity. A random plasma aldosterone/renin activity (PA/PRA) >65 (conventional units ratio [CUR] >30) has been proposed as a screening test. We have retrospectively determined the value of the post-captopril plasma aldosterone/renin activity (CAPT PA/PRA) test for the diagnosis of patients with primary aldosteronism whose PA/PRA was <65. We considered the CAPT PA/PRA test to be positive for primary aldosteronism if either the plasma aldosterone concentration did not drop below 0.33 nmol/L (12 ng/dL) or the ratio was >26 (CUR >12). We found 6 patients with a random PA/PRA of 21 to 60 (CUR 10 to 28), yet with an abnormal post-captopril test criteria for primary aldosteronism. Five had an abnormal saline suppression test, and all 6 were confirmed by a combination of diagnostic localization with computerized axial tomography, iodocholesterol scan, adrenal venous sampling, and/or surgery. Four had idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, and 2 had an aldosterone-producing adenoma. One other patient had an abnormal random plasma aldosterone/renin activity ratio of 99 (CUR 46), a negative saline infusion study, and was determined to have essential hypertension. In summary, the CAPT PA/PRA, but not the random PA/PRA, correctly diagnosed 6 patients with primary aldosteronism in our institution. An additional patient with essential hypertension was incorrectly diagnosed as having primary aldosteronism by the PA/PRA test. We conclude that the simple addition of 25 mg of captopril, taken orally 2 hours before sampling, enhances the accuracy for diagnosing patients with primary aldosteronism.", 
    "89": "Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been shown to attenuate the antihypertensive efficacy of ACE inhibitors with average increases in systolic blood pressure (BP) of 5 to 10 mm Hg. Less is known about the specific cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors now widely used for the treatment of arthritis. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of celecoxib compared with placebo on 24-hour BP levels in ACE inhibitor-treated patients with hypertension. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial involving 178 men and women (mean age, 53 years) with essential hypertension who were treated and controlled with lisinopril monotherapy (10 to 40 mg daily). Baseline BP values were obtained using 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Patients received either celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose for osteoarthritis) (n=91), or placebo (n=87) for 4 weeks, and changes in the 24-hour BP, body weight, and clinical laboratory parameters were assessed. Mean changes from baseline in the 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP were 2.6/1.5+/-0.9/0.6 mm Hg on celecoxib versus 1.0/0.3+/-1/0.6 mm Hg on placebo (P=0.34 for systolic BP; P=0.45 for diastolic BP). The proportion of patients whose 24-hour BP increased by at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg were also similar on celecoxib and placebo. No changes in body weight, serum creatinine, or potassium occurred in either group. Thus, these data demonstrate that high doses of celecoxib have no significant effect on the antihypertensive effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The placebo-subtracted changes observed in 24-hour BP (1.6/1.2 mm Hg) are less than what has been reported for nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in ACE inhibitor-treated patients.",

There was no difference found between SFGC and placebo in serious adverse events.

This does not necessarily apply to patients with proteinuric nephropathies, who might be referred late in the course of their disease. Here we used a severe rat model of passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), which may mimic advanced phases of human membranous nephropathy, to study the response to ACE inhibitor alone or in combination with a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) that independently of the cholesterol-lowering effect influences pathways involved in inflammatory and fibrogenic processes.

Six normal rats served as controls. Animals were sacrificed at 10 months.", 
    "96": "By the end of the study three PHN rats died in the vehicle group, four in the group given lisinopril at 40 mg/L and two in the group at 400 mg/L, whereas all rats on simvastatin or combined therapy were alive. Blood pressure increased during time in PHN and was normalized by treatment with ACE inhibitor and combined therapy. Even at the high dose lisinopril failed to reduce proteinuria. Simvastatin only partially affected proteinuria. However, combining lisinopril with simvastatin had a remarkable antiproteinuric effect, such that at 10 months the urinary proteins were comparable to pre-treatment values and significantly lower than either the vehicle or lisinopril groups. Hypercholesterolemia of PHN rats was limited by combined therapy, and a positive correlation was found between serum cholesterol and proteinuria. Renal function was only partially ameliorated by simvastatin but significantly improved by combined therapy. Drug combination significantly limited glomerulosclerosis, tubular damage and interstitial inflammation, compared to vehicle or drugs alone. Up-regulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA in PHN kidneys was not affected by lisinopril, it was inhibited by 30% after simvastatin, and almost completely normalized by lisinopril plus simvastatin.",

Numerous risk factors have been identified that predict the future onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals and an early stage of the disease (impaired glucose tolerance) can often be identified. Insulin resistance is central to the pathogenesis and is initially compensated by an increased insulin secretion. Over time, insulin secretion progressively fails and diabetes appears. Several approaches have been proposed for the prevention of diabetes. Lifestyle changes (nutritional therapy and physical activity) have been shown to reduce the frequency of diabetes in small studies and are being assessed in the NIH-funded Diabetes Prevention Trial. Metformin, which reduces insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, is being assessed in this same trial. Acarbose, which has been shown to reduce post-prandial insulin secretion and improve insulin resistance, is being assessed in the STOP-NIDDM trial. The ACE inhibitor ramipril has been shown in the HOPE study to reduce the appearance of diabetes by one third when given to patients with vascular disorders and this class of agents has been shown to improve insulin resistance. Another very promising approach is the use of thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) to improve the insulin resistance and possibly preserve the beta cells by reducing the need for increased insulin secretion. These lifestyle changes and medications have been shown to be safe in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. There is a high probability that one of these approaches will be effective in delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes, and prevention may become a clinical reality in the near future.",

Neither mRNA nor activity of NOS differed between the groups. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin and acetylcholine but not the calcium ionophore were shifted significantly to the left in femoral and pulmonary arteries from hCD46 transgenic pigs compared with nontransgenic pigs. The ACE-inhibitor captopril augmented relaxations similarly in both groups, but NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) did not inhibit relaxations in rings from transgenic pigs.",

There does not seem to be any change in activity of ACE or NOS with expression of the human protein. Increased relaxations to bradykinin may be beneficial in lowering vascular resistance when transgenic organs are used for xenotransplantation.", 
    "107": "The treatment of hypertension has evolved in recent years. Blood pressure lowering per se is no longer a sufficient parameter to evaluate its beneficial effects on end-organ damage. Drugs must be considered on the basis of their effects on cellular level and structural alterations that occur in the vasculature, heart and kidney. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, two classes of drugs that inhibit angiotensin II effects, may protect target organs from damage and thereby improve outcomes. The mechanisms of action are different even if both counteract all noxious effects of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II receptor blockers selectively inhibit AT1 receptors whose stimulation mediates the hypertensive and proliferative effects of angiotensin II while do not interfere with AT2 receptors. These last ones have a role not well established but it has been postulated that they have antihypertensive and antiproliferative effects. A review will be made on the cellular mechanisms of angiotensin II activity and the effects of AT receptor antagonists.",

Angiotensin II (AGII) is involved in the progression of renal diseases including diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of high glucose in concert with AGII on IL-6 production in human mesangial cells and the modulation by blocking AGII. After 48 hr of culture, IL-6 mRNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Quantitative determination of IL-6 concentrations in the culture supernatants of mesangial cells was performed using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay kit. Incubation of mesangial cells with high glucose (450 mg/dL) reduced the ratio of PCR products for IL-6 to beta-actin on densitometric results, while AGII (10(-7)M) increased it. The IL-6 secretion in the supernatant was also increased by AGII and decreased by high glucose. The IL-6 mRNA expression and IL-6 secretion in combination of high glucose and AGII were higher than those in high glucose and similar with those in control media. The addition of losartan (10(-6)M) or captopril (10(-6)M) to high glucose had no additional effects on IL-6 production. These results suggest that whereas AGII increases IL-6 production, high glucose decreases it. The IL-6 production of mesangial cells in diabetic milieu may be complicated and depend on the local effects of high glucose and/or AGII.",

Angiotensin II may be elevated in CHF despite treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, producing a rationale for adjunctive angiotensin receptor blockade. We investigated whether the addition of angiotensin antagonism to ACE inhibition would reduce oxidative stress and improve endothelial function and exercise tolerance in patients with chronic heart failure.",

Plasma lipid-derived free radicals, TBARS and neutrophil O2-generation, markers of oxidative stress, were measured in venous blood. Arterial endothelial function was assessed as the response of the brachial artery to flow-related shear stress. Exercise capacity was determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Compared with placebo, candesartan had no effect on changes in lipid derived free radicals (-0.1+/-1.2 vs. -0.1+/-1.0 units, respectively, P=NS), TBARS (-2.2+/-1.1 vs. -2.6+/-2.2 micromol/l, respectively, P=NS) or neutrophil O2-generating capacity (-7.3+/-5.1 vs. -8.4+/-7.9 mV/5x10(5) neutrophils, respectively, P=NS). There was no effect on changes in brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (0.5+/-1.0 vs. 0.8+/-1.3%, respectively, P=NS) nor peak VO2 (1.6+/-0.7 ml/kg per min vs. 1.8+/-0.6 ml/kg per min; P=NS).",

    "126": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is often associated with impaired renal function due to hypoperfusion. Such patients are very sensitive to changes in renal perfusion pressure, and may develop acute tubular necrosis if the pressure falls too far. The situation is complicated by the use of diuretics, ACE inhibitors and spironolactone, all of which may affect renal function and potassium balance. Chronic renal failure (CRF) may also be associated with fluid overload. Anaemia and hypertension in CRF contribute to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which carries a poor prognosis, so correction of these factors is important.", 
    "127": "Neurons expressing the preprotachykinin A gene, which encodes the sequences of substance P, neurokinin A, neuropeptide gamma and neuropeptide K, exemplify peptide co-existence. Furthermore, there is also evidence that substance P fragments have biological activity. However, the relative contribution of each of these peptides to tachykinin signalling is still poorly understood. An important factor which will determine the characteristics of the signal mediated by co-localised peptides is their clearance from the extracellular space. The striatum, in which tachykinins are present and exert neuromodulatory roles, can be used as a model to investigate this aspect. Therefore, in this study we characterised in vivo in the striatum the metabolism and clearance of substance P and of the other three co-expressed peptides. After intrastriatal administration of 1 pmol, tritiated substance P disappeared too rapidly for metabolites to be detected. However, when 10 nmol substance P and 1 pmol tritiated substance P were co-injected, substance P(1-4) and substance P(1-7), which are biologically active, were detected as major metabolites. Under these conditions, the rate of decay of tritiated substance P was 0.2 nmol/min. The effects of the peptidase inhibitors thiorphan, bestatin and captopril suggested that neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and aminopeptidases were involved in primary substance P cleavages, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme was involved in secondary cleavages. The monitoring of the decay of unlabelled substance P by high-performance liquid chromatography gave a rate of 0.16 nmol/min. Using high-performance liquid chromatography with capillary electrophoresis, the rates of decay of 10 nmol neurokinin A or neuropeptide gamma were five and seven times faster than that of substance P. In contrast, over the time course of the experiment, no significant decay of neuropeptide K was detected. These results show that substance P disappears rapidly from the extracellular space, and supports the formation in vivo of major N-terminal active substance P metabolites. Our study also highlights significant differences in the clearance of co-expressed tachykinins and suggests that certain species may disappear relatively slowly from the extracellular space, and thus may make a significant temporal and spatial contribution to signalling.", 
    "128": "This work was undertaken to investigate the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on aortic function of two-kidney and one-clip (2K1C) rats with renal hypertension. Animals were divided into 5 groups: the sham operation, 2K1C, captopril, L-arginine and L-NAME groups. The results are as follows. At the 4th week after constriction of the left renal artery, the mean arterial pressure was significantly elevated. In isolated aortic rings, acetylcholine-induced dilation was attenuated, and phenylephrine induced contractile response was markedly enhanced. The level of aorta cGMP content was significantly lowered. These changes were abolished in 2K1C rats treated with captopril. L-arginine partially reversed the aortic vascular reactivity of 2K1C rats, and elevated aortic cGMP content. In 2K1C rats treated with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, blood pressure was increased further, acetylcholine-induced aorta diastolic response was attenuated further and cGMP content reduced, while phenylephrine-induced contractile response was unaffected. These results suggest that deficiency of nitric oxide production and increase in renin-angiotensin system activity may contribute to vascular endothelial dysfunction of 2K1C rats, and these factors may be involved in development and maintenance of 2K1C renal hypertension.",

Left ventricular end-systolic dimension increased to a greater extent from baseline in AT(1)RB dogs versus untreated MR dogs (29 +/- 9% vs. 12 +/- 6%, p < 0.05), despite a significantly lower LV peak systolic pressure in AT(1)RB dogs.

The mechanism of this increase was mediated through further reduction in coronary microvascular resistance. L-arginine infusion also resulted in greater epicardial dilator response after ACh among African Americans.",

    "143": "Progression to renal parenchymal damage and end-stage renal disease, which seems to be largely independent of the initial insult, is the final common pathway for chronic, proteinuric nephropathies in animals and humans. The key event is enhanced glomerular capillary pressure; this impairs glomerular permeability to proteins and permits excessive amounts of proteins to reach the lumen of the proximal tubule. The secondary process of reabsorption of filtered proteins can contribute to renal interstitial injury by activating intracellular events, including upregulation of the genes encoding vasoactive and inflammatory mediators. Both interstitial inflammation and progression of disease can be controlled by such drugs as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which strengthen the glomerular permeability barrier to proteins and thereby limit proteinuria and filtered protein-dependent inflammatory signals. Clinical data strongly suggest that remission can now be achieved in some patients with chronic renal disease. Because of the current lag time between starting treatment and remission, however, a substantial proportion of patients still progress to end-stage renal disease before renal function begins to stabilize. A multimodal approach that centers on reducing or removing all risk factors associated with the progression of renal disease may decrease the time to remission of the disease for most patients with proteinuric nephropathies.",

The total number of patients was estimated at 17,700 for DCM, 21,900 for HCM, 300 for RCM, 520 for ARVD, 640 for mitochondrial disease, 150 for Fabry's disease of the heart, and 1,000 for prolonged Q-T interval syndrome. The prevalence of both DCM and HCM was higher in men than women: the male-to-female ratios were 2.6 and 2.3 for DCM and HCM, respectively. Detailed data on patients with DCM or HCM were collected by a follow-up survey. In 1 year more patients with DCM (5.6%) died than with HCM (2.8%): congestive heart failure (CHF) and arrhythmias were the leading causes of death for DCM and HCM, respectively. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (64.6%) and beta-adrenergic blockers (40.9%) are commonly used to treat the CHF complicating DCM and may be associated with the clinical improvement in a significant number of DCM patients. Thus, the nationwide surveys of Japanese patients have yielded important current epidemiological and clinical information on the characteristics of cardiomyopathies in Japan.", 
    "145": "Restenosis after coronary artery stent implantation is attributed chiefly to intimal hyperplasia, which is prevented experimentally by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Therefore, the present study investigated whether the effect of quinapril, a tissue-specific ACE inhibitor, on the prevention of coronary restenosis differs according to ACE polymorphism. One hundred consecutive patients with successful stent implantation were randomly assigned to quinapril and control groups. Both follow-up angiography and ACE polymorphism analysis were obtained from 92 patients (control, 46; quinapril treatment, 46). The prevalence of risk factors did not differ statistically according to quinapril treatment or ACE genotypes. There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of restenosis 6 months after stenting between the groups. Quantitative coronary angiography revealed that quinapril treatment resulted in significantly higher minimal lumen diameter and significantly lower percent diameter stenosis (22.9 +/- 22.6 vs 37.1 +/- 19.7% in the control group, p < 0.05) in patients with the D allele although there was no difference in those with the II genotype. In addition, intravascular ultrasound revealed that quinapril treatment significantly prevented the loss of minimal lumen cross-sectional area and the increase in percent area stenosis (34.5 +/- 14.0 vs 53.3 +/- 16.4% in the control group, p < 0.05) in patients with the D allele compared to those with the II genotype.

L arginine transport of myocardial ventricular tissue and erythrocytes, total nitric oxide synthase (tNOS) activity, nitrite and nitrate (NO(2) + NO(3)) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) content in myocardium were measured. The result showed that in myocardial ventricular tissue of SHR L-arginine transport decreased significantly with V(max) of the high-affinity transport being decreased by 24.3% (P<0.05, 12W group), 36.4% (P<0.01, 16W group) as compared with WKY group.

Protection was not observed in patients treated with balloon angioplasty alone during the same period (OR 1.06, p = 0.33), which is consistent with the results of prior randomized trials.

In this study, the renoprotective effects of candesartan cilexetil, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, and enalapril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, were examined in SHC rats. Candesartan cilexetil (0.1 and 1 mg /kg) and enalapril (10 mg/kg) were administered orally to 10-week-old SHC rats for a 6-week period. Candesartan cilexetil (1 mg/kg) and enalapril (10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited proteinuria and hypercholesterolemia to a similar extent. In untreated 16-week-old SHC rats, glomerulosclerosis, basophilic change, cast formation and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration were observed. Candesartan cilexetil (1 mg/kg) inhibited all of these histological changes. Enalapril inhibited glomerulosclerosis and cast formation. These results show that candesartan cilexetil and enalapril have renal protective effects in SHC rats.

The C-terminal bioactive peptide and N-terminal BNP (N-BNP) circulate at concentrations related to cardiac status. We proposed that plasma levels of N-BNP would provide an index to guide drug treatment in established heart failure. Sixty-nine patients were randomized to treatment adjusted according to clinical criteria or plasma N-BNP. Hormone-guided therapy resulted in fewer clinical end points than did clinical management. This encourages further exploration of hormone guidance of anti-heart failure therapy, which could be extended to patients with preserved ejection fraction, in addition to those with established systolic dysfunction.",

Coinciding with the sharp decrease, we observed a reduction in prescription duration by 31% in patients switching to no-cost drugs. This reduction may be attributed to increased monitoring for intolerance or treatment failure in switchers, which in turn led to a spurious reduction in total drug utilization.

    "183": "Experiments were carried out in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were randomly divided into three groups: control, stressed and stress + captopril. Stress stimulations were composed of repeated electric foot-shock combined with noise, twice one day (2 h each session) for 15 consecutive days. Animals in the stress+captopril group were administered with captopril (50 mg/kg.d) intraperitoneally. The results showed that at the end of the 15-day experiment the systolic pressure of the tail artery in stressed rats was significantly higher than that of the control rats, i.e., 19.75+/ C1.0 kPa (n=8, P<0.05) versus 16.32+/ C0.55 kPa (n=7); the vasopressin (AVP) mRNA level in the hypothalamus of the stressed rats also increased significantly compared with that of the control rats, i.e., 12990.33+/ C1533.58 (n=6, P<0.001) versus 7332.66+/ C522.65 (n=6). However, in the stress + captopril rats, both the tail artery systolic pressure and hypothalamic AVP mRNA level were significantly higher than those of the control rats, but lower than those of the stressed rats. In the control rats, no significant change in mean blood pressure (MBP) was observed after intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of 0.3 microgram of d(CH(2))(5)Tyr(Me)AVP, a selective AVP V(1) receptor antagonist; however, a decrease in MBP was observed in both stressed and stress+captopril rats (P<0.05), but the decrease in stress+captopril rats was more obvious than that of the stressed rats after icv a same dose of d(CH(2))(5)Tyr(Me)AVP. These results indicate that the endogenous renin-angiotensin system participates in the mechanism of the stress-induced high blood pressure in rats, and that the effect of Ang II is mediated mainly by stimulating hypothalamic AVP synthesis and release, which in turn result in an increase in blood pressure by acting on the central V (1) receptors.",

The inhibitory effect of a range of hydroxamic acid-based compounds on the secretases involved in cleaving and releasing these four proteins has been examined to build up a structure-activity relationship. Compounds have been identified that can discriminate between TNF-alpha convertase and the other three secretases (compound 15), between the shedding of CD23 and the shedding of APP and ACE (compound 21), and between the secretases and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (compound 22). The structure-activity relationship for the APP alpha-secretase and the ACE secretase were remarkably similar, and both secretases were activated in whole cell systems by the serine proteinase inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin. The basal and carbachol-stimulated shedding of APP and ACE from human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells could not be differentiated by any of the hydroxamate compounds, implying that the same or very similar activities are involved in the constitutive and regulated shedding of these two proteins. By utilizing a key discriminatory compound (compound 15) that potently inhibits TNF-alpha convertase but not alpha-secretase, we show that TNF-alpha convertase is not involved in the regulated shedding of APP from human neuronal cells. The compounds reported here will be useful in future studies aimed at identifying and validating candidate secretases.",

The observation of a patient in whom pemphigus vulgaris (PV) worsened after taking fosinopril prompted us to study an experimental way to assess its responsibility. Slices of normal human skin (NHS) were simultaneously incubated for 2, 6, 12 and 24 h at 4 degrees C with progressively diluted fosinopril and captopril solutions and used as indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) substrates for 2 sera containing anti-desmoglein-3 (anti-Dsg3) antibodies at a dilution of 1/160. With captopril, IIF was negative, irrespective of dilution and time of incubation. Only at 1/40,000 dilution was IIF positive. With fosinopril, IIF was negative for the 2- and 6-hour-long incubations but turned positive after 12 h and so remained with all other solutions and incubation times. IIF negativity with captopril suggests that anti-Dsg3 antibodies contained in the PV sera were unable to find molecules in NHS to bind to. Captopril would therefore induce acantholysis by blocking the adhesion molecules. With fosinopril, instead, a partial block of the adhesion molecules was seen only with the very concentrated solution, unlikely to occur in vivo. Fosinopril, therefore, is probably unable to block the adhesion molecules in vivo. Our method might be used to verify the acantholytic properties of a drug.", 
    "205": "Previous studies have shown that the development of tolerance to nitroglycerin is related to a decrease in the release of endogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). In the present study, we explored whether endogenous CGRP is involved in reversal of tolerance to nitroglycerin with N-acetylcysteine or captopril in rats in vivo and vitro. Tolerance was induced by exposure to nitroglycerin (4.4 x 10(-6) M) for 10 min in vitro or by pretreatment with nitroglycerin (10 mg/kg, s.c.) three times a day for 8 days in vivo. Nitroglycerin (3 x 10(-9)-10(-6) M) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation in the isolated rat thoracic aorta, an effect that was reduced by CGRP-(8-37) (3 x 10(-7) M) or capsaicin (3 x 10(-7) M). Preincubation with nitroglycerin for 10 min significantly decreased its vasodilation, which was restored in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (10(-5) M) or captopril (10(-5) M). Nitroglycerin (150 microg/kg, i.v.) produced a depressor effect and an increase in concentrations of nitric oxide and CGRP, and the effects of nitroglycerin disappeared after pretreatment with nitroglycerin for 8 days. However, tolerance to nitroglycerin in vivo also was partially restored in the presence of N-acetylcysteine or captopril. The present results suggest that reversal of tolerance to nitroglycerin with N-acetylcysteine or captopril is related to the increased release of CGRP in the rat.",

    "210": "Paraquat (PQ) is a herbicide that is very toxic to all living organisms. It generates free radicals and leads to acute or chronic lung injury. Free radicals are often associated with fibrogenesis, which occurs in various disease states. The purpose of this study was to determine whether captopril prevents paraquat toxicity in lung tissue. Paraquat alone increased the level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) after 4, 12, 24 and 72 h of administration. Also, the level of hydroxyproline showed an increase after 24 h of paraquat administration. However, paraquat also decreased the level of glutathione (GSH) and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Captopril (50 mg/kg i.p.) and paraquat were simultaneously injected (40 mg/kg i.p.), and the captopril injection 1 h after paraquat ameliorated the biochemical toxicity induced by paraquat. This was evidenced by a significant reduction in LPO and balancing the endogenous antioxidant capacity by normalizing the activities of SOD and GSH-Px and the GSH content in the lung tissue. Moreover, captopril injection prevented the increase of hydroxyproline content as an index of lung fibrosis. From these results, the beneficial effects of captopril on paraquat toxicity appear to be through enhancement of the endogenous antioxidant system preventing the lung fibrosis.", 
    "211": "The purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic administration of temocapril, a long-acting non-SH group angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduced proteinuria, inhibited glomerular hypertrophy and prevented glomerulosclerosis in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) - induced nephrotic rats. Nephrosis was induced by injection of PAN (15mg/100g body weight) in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Four groups were used, i) the PAN group (14), ii) PAN/temocapril (13), iii) temocapril (14) and iv) untreated controls (15). Temocapril (8 mg/kg/day) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4, 14 or 20. At each time point, systolic blood pressure (BP), urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated, and morphometric image analysis was done. Systolic BP in the PAN group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks, but was normal in the PAN/temocapril group. Urinary protein excretion in the PAN group increased significantly, peaking at 8 days, then decreased at 4 weeks, but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks. Temocapril did not attenuate proteinuria at 8 days, but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20. The glomerulosclerosis index (GSI) was 6.21 % at 4 weeks and respectively 25.35 % and 30.49 % at 14 and 20 weeks in the PAN group. There was a significant correlation between urinary protein excretion and GSI (r = 0.808, p < 0.0001). The ratio of glomerular tuft area to the area of Bowman's capsules (GT/BC) in the PAN group was significantly increased, but it was significantly lower in the PAN/temocapril group. It appears that temocapril was effective in retarding renal progression and protected renal function in PAN neprotic rats.", 
    "212": "Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular and renal organ damage. Environmental conditions affect the development of high blood pressure (BP), although genetic influences are also important. Current international guidelines recommend reducing dietary sodium to no more than 100 mmol (about 2.4 g sodium or approximately 6 g salt) per day to prevent BP rising; the current intake of sodium in industrialized countries is approximately double the recommended amount. Clinical trials (DASH and TOHP studies) have shown that dietary factors are fundamental in the prevention and control of BP. Low dietary sodium intake is particularly effective in preventing hypertension in subjects with an increased risk such as the overweight, borderline hypertensives or the elderly. A low-salt diet combined with anti-hypertensive therapies facilitates BP reduction independent of race. The hypotensive effect of calcium channel blockers is less dependent on salt intake than other drugs, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics. Reduced sodium intake associated with other dietary changes (such as weight loss, and increasing potassium, calcium and magnesium intake) are important instruments for the prevention and therapy of hypertension.",

By contrast, MMP-2 mRNA was increased but its activity decreased (43 % and 43 % respectively, p < 0.05 vs control). Total degradative capacity of kidney tissue from diabetic rats was also lower (Control: 48 +/- 7 %, Diabetic: 33 +/- 6 %, p < 0.05). Activation of latent MMPs with amino-phenylmercuric acetate increased matrix degradation by two-fold. However the relative decrease associated with experimental diabetes still remained. All diabetes-associated changes in MMP and TIMP mRNA and activities were attenuated by perindopril treatment in association with reduced type IV collagen accumulation.",

Diastolic and systolic blood pressure did not differ significantly between the two subgroups with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, i. e. those patients receiving ACE-inhibition (medians 88/160 mm Hg, respectively) and the others (90/160). For the mostly used ACE-inhibitor in the proliferative diabetic retinopathy group, i. e. enalapril ( n = 8), a linear dose-effect relation was observed (-20 +/- 4 pg x ml(-1) x mg(-1) x day(-1); p = 0.024; coefficient +/- SEM).",

The contribution of the local vascular production of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] to the control of alpha-adrenergic-induced contractions in the aorta of Sprague-Dawley (SD) and TGR(mRen-2)27 [mRen-2] rats was studied. 2. In mRen-2 rats, contractile responses to phenylephrine were diminished as compared to control SD rats in endothelium containing but not in endothelium-denuded vessels. L-NAME increased contractile responses to phenylephrine in mRen-2 rats and, after nitric oxide synthase blockade, responses to phenylephrine became comparable in both strains. 3. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by captopril potentiated contractile responses in mRen-2 rats and diminished contractile responses in SD rats, both effects being dependent on the presence of a functional endothelium. The effect of captopril in mRen-2 rats was abolished in vessels pre-incubated with Ang-(1-7). 4. Blockade of Ang-(1-7) and bradykinin (BK) receptors by A-779 and HOE 140 respectively, increased phenylephrine-induced contraction in mRen-2, but not in SD rats. This effect was seen only in endothelium-containing vessels. 5. Angiotensin II AT(1) and AT(2) receptor blockade by CV 11974 and PD 123319 did not affect the contractile responses to phenylephrine in aortas of transgenic animals but diminished the response in SD rats. This effect was only seen in the presence of a functional endothelium. 6. It is concluded that the decreased contractile responses to phenylephrine in aortas of mRen-2 rats was dependent on an intact endothelium, the local release and action of Ang-(1-7) and bradykinin.", 
    "222": "The lactating mammary gland utilizes free plasma amino acids as well as those derived by hydrolysis from circulating short-chain peptides for protein synthesis. Apart from the major route of amino acid nitrogen delivery to the gland by the various transporters for free amino acids, it has been suggested that dipeptides may also be taken up in intact form to serve as a source of amino acids. The identification of peptide transporters in the mammary gland may therefore provide new insights into protein metabolism and secretion by the gland. The expression and distribution of the high-affinity type proton-coupled peptide transporter PEPT2 were investigated in rat lactating mammary gland as well as in human epithelial cells derived from breast milk. By use of RT-PCR, PEPT2 mRNA was detected in rat mammary gland extracts and human milk epithelial cells. The expression pattern of PEPT2 mRNA revealed a localization in epithelial cells of ducts and glands by nonisotopic high resolution in situ hybridization. In addition, immunohistochemistry was carried out and showed transporter immunoreactivity in the same epithelial cells of the glands and ducts. In addition, two-electrode voltage clamp recordings using PEPT2-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated positive inward currents induced by selected dipeptides that may play a role in aminonitrogen handling in mammalian mammary gland. Taken together, these data suggest that PEPT2 is expressed in mammary gland epithelia, in which it may contribute to the reuptake of short-chain peptides derived from hydrolysis of milk proteins secreted into the lumen. Whereas PEPT2 also transports a variety of drugs, such as selected beta-lactams, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiviral and anticancer metabolites, their efficient reabsorption via PEPT2 may reduce the burden of xenobiotics in milk.", 
    "223": "The effect of ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction (MI) on MI healing and remodeling in the presence of hypertension is not exactly known. Therefore, the effect of quinapril on scar formation, remodeling and hemodynamics was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Nine weeks after moderate and large MI, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and passive pressure-volume relations were similar in 28-week-old hypertensive and normotensive rats. Chronic therapy with quinapril (6 mg/kg/day, started 30 min post-MI) reduced LVEDP and LV to body weight ratio, yet did not affect pressure-volume relations. Quinapril increased MI size and reduced the content and brightness of collagen fibers in the scar examined by polarized light microscopy. In conclusion, ventricular dilatation after MI was not accelerated in SHR, probably due to LV hypertrophy. Quinapril produced beneficial hemodynamic effects similar to that observed in the normotensive rat model.

Renovascular hypertension must be distinguished from renal artery stenosis. In true renovascular hypertension, the kidney takes charge of the blood pressure and will do what it takes to push blood pressure high enough to force blood through the blocked artery. This can be diagnosed with functional tests that measure glomerular filtration rate before and after blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or antagonists of the AT(1) subtype of the angiotensin receptor. There is insufficient data on which to make evidence-based recommendations on the management of renovascular hypertension. Only two randomised trials exist of angioplasty versus medical therapy and of these the larger was severely contaminated by angioplasty among the group initially assigned to medical therapy. Only one trial exists of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition versus alternative medical therapy. The drugs that are most effective in medical management of renovascular hypertension--angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor-1 blockers--tend to be avoided because of fear of a very rare complication (acute renal failure in patients with severe stenosis of both renal arteries, or the artery to a single remaining kidney). This fear is misplaced not only because it is rare (< 5% of patients with renovascular hypertension) but because it is reversible and treatable by revascularisation. Patients with renovascular hypertension should be evaluated by nuclear medicine differential glomerular filtration rate, enhanced by blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. If medical therapy is ineffective or causes severe impairment of renal function, revascularisation is required. Some experts favour surgical revascularisation because of occasional angioplasty failure and the risk of deterioration of renal function after angioplasty.", 
    "225": "The rabbit jugular vein (rbJV) was used as a bioassay system to validate some early and new hypothetical interactions between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the B2 receptor, which may be influenced by ACE inhibitors (ACE-I). These involve the potentiation of the contractile effect of bradykinin (BK) and BK analogues, which are inactivated by ACE (e.g., [Hyp3, Tyr(Me8)]-BK (R556)), the prevention of BK-induced B2 receptor desensitisation, and the restoration of receptor sensitivity in tissues desensitised with B2 receptor agonists. Enzymatic degradation studies performed in vitro and in vivo revealed that BK and R556 are readily degraded by rabbit ACE whereas [Phe8psi(CH2-NH)Arg9]-BK (R379) is totally resistant. BK, R556, and R379 contracted endothelium-denuded veins with similar potencies (pEC50 range 8.10-8.50). Tissues pretreated with ACE-I showed an increase in pEC50 values for BK and R556 but not for R379. ACE-I (captopril, enalaprilat) were unable to prevent B2 receptor desensitisation induced by BK (1 microM). ACE-I partially restored B2 receptor-mediated contraction in tissues initially exposed to BK but not to R379. These effects were antagonised by HOE 140 (0.1 microM) but were unaffected by AcLys[Dbeta-Nal7, Ile8]-desArg9BK (R715) (1 microM) or by Losartan (1 microM). In conclusion, the potentiation of BK and its analogues relates exclusively on prevention of their metabolism, B2 receptor desensitisation is not affected by ACE-I, and restoration of tissue responsiveness to BK by ACE-I may be attributed to changes in BK concentrations in the vicinity of the B2 receptor.", 
    "226": "The effect of RP-HPLC-purified fractions of fish waste hydrolysates issued from three fish industries was tested on guinea pig ileum in order to examine the presence of opioid molecules. The evaluation of anti-hypertensive activities of whole hydrolysates and fractions were also tested, monitoring the ability of the fraction to inhibit the activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme involved in hypertension regulation. Sardine autolysate and cod head hydrolysate powder (50 microg) were able to inhibit near 30% of ACE activity, whereas 50 microg of shrimp hydrolysate allows the inhibition of 57% of ACE activity. HPLC fractionation of cod head hydrolysate and sardine autolysate was necessary to evidence biological activity, whereas HPLC separation of shrimp hydrolysate exhibited low biological activity fractions. Further studies are necessary to characterise bioactive molecules from cod head alcalase hydrolysate and from sardine autolysate.", 
    "227": "The French epidemiological data on cardiac insufficiency in the hospital environment are scarce. A register collecting 1772 patients was produced by the services of the National College of General Hospital Cardiologists (C.N.C.H.G.) during two periods: autumn 1999 (November) and spring 2000 (June). It involved completing a form for each of the first 20 patients with cardiac failure hospitalized over a month. 1011 and 761 observations from 59 and 47 centres (that is 17 and 16 observations per centre) were collected during the autumn and spring periods respectively. In France, in the general hospital centres (CHG) cardiology services during the year 2000, the characteristics and the medical treatment of hospitalized patients with cardiac failure are very similar to those presented in 1998 by A. Cohen-Solal in the name of the working group \"Cardiomyopathy and Cardiac Insuficiency of the French Society of Cardiology\". The hospitalized patient with cardiac failure is very old, usually male, has an ischaemic cardiopathy in one in two cases, and is at stage II and III on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) scale in 83% of cases. There is practically always an electrocardiographic anomaly. Loop diuretics are prescribed nine times out of ten, digitalis one in three, anagiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are underused being prescribed two out of three times, but an increase in the prescription of anti-aldosterone and betablockers is found. The majority of patients improve during their stay, 7.8% dying and this mortality is influenced by age, ejection fraction (FE), functional NYHA class, causal cardiopathy, and the existence of severe renal failure. The data collected by the cardiology services of the C.N.C.H.G. are representative of the profile of the population affected and are important to know in order to improve the management of these patients.", 
    "228": "The morbidity and mortality of cardiac insufficiency remains such that it justifies the pursuit of finding new drugs and new sensitive techniques to slow or abolish its evolution. Bringing the vasopeptidases, such as omapatrilat, up to date results in a rational process aimed at simultaneously modulating certain interactive humoral systems. They represent drugs which simultaneously inhibit neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme with the effect of potentiating the natiuretic peptide system and bradykinin, and blocking the conversion of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. In the IMPRESS study, omapatrilat has been evaluated in patients with cardiac insufficiency versus lisinopril; there was no significant difference on the principal outcome measure which was exercise tolerance, however it was significantly more effective than lisinopril on the outcome measure combining death and hospital admission for deteriorating cardiac insufficiency. A wider study is underway, the OVERTURE study, which is evaluating omapatrilat versus enalapril on hospital admission and all-cause mortality. The Vanlev dossier has not yet been submitted to the regulatory authorities for obtaining its authorisation to be put on the market.", 
    "229": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have progressively stood out in a large population of heart failure patients as a gold-standard treatment, in relation with their beneficial effects on mortality and morbidity. In a recent meta-analysis published in the Lancet collecting 12,763 patients, Flather demonstrates global mortality decrease of 25% compared to placebo. This risk reduction not only concerns the mortality due to heart failure but also that due to myocardial infarction. The same goes for the morbidity. Thus, in international as well as European recommendations, ACE-inhibitors are indicated as a first lane treatment in heart failure due to systolic LV dysfunction. Nonetheless several questions remain unanswered. The ACE-inhibitors are under-utilised, not only they are under-prescribed (only 60% of heart failure patients benefit from them) but also when prescribed, the dosage (comparing to those used in clinical trials) is generally as low as the half expected. This under-utilisation seems to be related to the side effects as renal failure, hypotension or more often due to the concern of their occurrence especially in the elderly and in those with other concomitant morbidities. They are actually related in part to an under-estimation of the benefit/risk ratio. The ATLAS study suggests that high doses of ACE-inhibitors are associated with a deeper reduction of morbidity without significant differences compared to low doses concerning global mortality or side effects. However this study compared very high (extreme) doses to low ones and comparison between heavy- and mid-doses remains to be performed. After the HOPE study, new indications appear promising: heart failure with preserved systolic function; patients with risk factors without heart failure: risk reduction of subsequent heart failure and reduction of mortality. Tolerance of their association with beta-blocking agents. In conclusion, the optimisation of the ACE-inhibitors treatment goes through a wider prescription with higher doses, probably extended to new indications.", 
    "230": "The role of bradykinin in the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors remains difficult to establish. On their haemodynamic effects, bradykinin acts during their acute administration, participating in their vasodilatation action, while during their chronic administration they act slightly or not at all. On their trophic effects, the action of the tissue kallikrein-kinin system, suggested by the results of animal experimentation, is yet to be demonstrated in man. For their effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality the role of bradykinin remains under discussion. Nevertheless, besides ACE inhibitors, the other therapeutic agents which increase the levels of bradykinin, such as neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, have a significant field of development in the course of cardiovascular pathologies.", 
    "231": "The CAPRICORN and COPERNICUS studies have confirmed the significance of betablocker treatment with carvedilol for indications which this medication did not yet possess: post-infarction with left ventricular dysfunction with or without clinical signs, and stable severe cardiac insufficiency. The reduction in morbidity and mortality obtained thanks to this therapy places it in the treatment of cardiac insufficiency in association with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors which remain unsurpassed.", 
    "232": "The IMPROVEMENT-HF programme (Improvement PROgramme on evaluation and management of Heart Failure) aimed to improve the management of patients with heart failure by general practitioners in France and in Europe. This programme had two aspects: diagnostic and therapeutic. In France, the programme had been carried out by the collaboration of 27 cardiologists and 217 general practitioners who collected the charts of 1200 patients. Among French doctors, the level of knowledge of the NYHA classification and the concept of diastolic dysfunction is poor. A majority of them request EKG and echocardiography for patients with heart failure. As expected, ACE-inhibitors are frequently prescribed, however, dosages remain low. It appears that the collaboration with cardiologists is close. In this study, some differences appear on the management between France and other countries.",

The effect of the aqueous leaf extract of M. cecropioides, found to contain mostly saponins, flavonoids and procyanidins, was investigated on vascular smooth muscle and also in an in vivo direct invasive blood pressure study in both normotensive and hypertensive rats. The hypotensive or antihypertensive properties of the extracts appear to be due partly to a direct or indirect vasodilator effect and also to some alpha(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic blocking effects. The extract also exhibited significant endothelium-dependent vascular smooth muscle relaxation, accounted for by the release of nitric oxide (NO), and induced significant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory effects thereby supporting its vasodilator mechanism of action.", 
    "234": "ACE inhibitory peptides are biologically active peptides that play a role in blood pressure regulation. When derived from food proteins during food processing or gastrointestinal digestion, these peptides could function as efficient agents in treating and preventing hypertension. However, in order to exert an antihypertensive effect by inhibition of the ACE enzyme, they have to reach the bloodstream intact. The aim of this research was to assess if the known ACE inhibitory peptide Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg, derived from a tryptic digest of beta-lactoglobulin, could be absorbed through a Caco-2 Bbe cell monolayer in an Ussing chamber and reach the serosal side undegraded. Samples of the mucosal compartment showed high ACE inhibitory activity. No or only little ACE inhibitory activity was detected in the serosal compartment. However, when the serosal sample was concentrated three-fold, a substantial ACE inhibitory activity was registered. Concomitantly, HPLC and MS clearly showed the presence of Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg in the mucosal compartment, whereas in the serosal compartment only MS was able to detect the heptapeptide. In conclusion. under the observed experimental conditions, the ACE inhibitory peptide Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg was transported intact through the Caco-2 Bbe monolayer, but in concentrations too low to exert an ACE inhibitory activity.", 
    "235": "Neutral endopeptidase (EC3.4.24.11, NEP, enkephalinase) is a zinc-metalloendopeptidase, cleaving a variety of substrates like enkephalins, substance P, and bradykinin. In the brain, NEP is a key enzyme in the degradation of enkephalins. Pharmacological inhibition of NEP-activity causes analgesia resulting from enhanced extracellular enkephalin concentrations. Recently, transgenic mice lacking the enzyme NEP have been developed (Lu, 1995). The present study was designed to investigate the nociceptive behavior of these NEP-knockout mice. Interestingly, NEP-deficient mice did not respond with decreased pain perception, but exhibited hyperalgesia in the hot-plate jump, warm-water tail-withdrawal, and mostnotablyin theacetic-acid writhing test. Inhibition of aminopeptidase N by bestatin reduced writhing in both strains, whereas NEP-inhibition by thiorphan reduced writhing selectively in wild-type mice. Naloxone increased writhing in wild-type but not in knockouts, whereas the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist HOE140 reduced writhing selectively in NEP-knockouts. Similarly, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME reduced writhing in NEP-knockouts. These results indicate that genetic elimination of NEP, in contrast to pharmacological inhibition, leads to bradykinin-induced hyperalgesia instead of enkephalin-mediated analgesia. Nitric oxide (NO) is suggested to be involved in this process.",

    "242": "Despite the trend of decreasing death rates attributable to ischaemic heart disease and stroke, the prevalence of heart failure and the resultant death rates in the United States have almost tripled between 1974 and 1994 [1]. Coronary artery disease is the commonest cause of heart failure in developed countries, accounting for up to 60% of cases. Advances in medical therapy, particularly the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, have served to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to coronary artery disease [2-5]. However, these improvements have been modest, and despite these therapies, patients with severe ischaemic cardiomyopathy continue to have a high mortality when treated medically. It is increasingly clear that the impaired LV function in these patients is not always an irreversible process. Traditionally, these observations have been made following demonstrable improvements in systolic function after coronary revascularization procedures. Diagnostic testing to evaluate the presence and extent of viable myocardium has therefore become an important component of the clinical assessment of patients with chronic coronary artery disease and LV dysfunction.",

The spectrophotometric procedures for the two cited drugs are based on ternary complex formation. The first ternary complex (copper(II), eosin, and enalapril) was estimated by two methods; the first depends on its extraction with chloroform measuring at 533.4 nm. Beer's law was obeyed in concentration range from 56 to 112 microg ml(-1). The second method for the same complex depends on its direct measurement after addition of methylcellulose as surfactant at the pH value 5 at 558.8 nm. The concentration range is from 19 to 32 microg ml(-1). The second ternary complex (iron(III), thiocyanate, and ramipril) was extracted with methylene chloride, measuring at 436.6 nm, with a concentration range 60-132 microg ml(-1). The direct atomic absorption spectrometric method through the quantitative determination of copper or iron content of the complex was also investigated for the purpose of enhancing the sensitivity of the determination. The spectrophotometric and atomic absorption spectrometric procedures hold their accuracy and precision well when applied to the determination of ramipril and enalapril dosage forms.", 
    "244": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in the management of essential hypertension, stable chronic heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetic nephropathy. There is an increasing number of new agents to add to the nine ACE inhibitors (benazepril, cilazapril, delapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, pentopril, perindopril, quinapril and ramipril) reviewed in this journal in 1990. The pharmacokinetic properties of five newer ACE inhibitors (trandolapril, moexipril, spirapril, temocapril and imidapril) are reviewed in this update. All of these new agents are characterised by having a carboxyl functional groups and requiring hepatic activation to form pharmacologically active metabolites. They achieve peak plasma concentrations at similar times (t(max)) to those of established agents. Three of these agents (trandolapril, moexipril and imidapril) require dosage reductions in patients with renal impairment. Dosage reductions of moexipril and temocapril are recommended for elderly patients, and dosages of moexipril should be lower in patients who are hepatically impaired. Moexipril should be taken 1 hour before meals, whereas other ACE inhibitors can be taken without regard to meals. The pharmacokinetics of warfarin are not altered by concomitant administration with trandolapril or moexipril. Although imidapril and spirapril have no effect on digoxin pharmacokinetics, the area under the concentration-time curve of imidapril and the peak plasma concentration of the active metabolite imidaprilat are decreased when imidapril is given together with digoxin. Although six ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, quinapril and ramipril) have been approved for use in heart failure by the US Food and Drug Administration, an overview of 32 clinical trials of ACE inhibitors in heart failure showed that no significant heterogeneity in mortality was found among enalapril, ramipril, quinapril, captopril, lisinopril, benazepril, perindopril and cilazapril. Initiation of therapy with captopril, ramipril, and trandolapril at least 3 days after an acute MI resulted in all-cause mortality risk reductions of 18 to 27%. Captopril has been shown to have similar morbidity and mortality benefits to those of diuretics and beta-blockers in hypertensive patients. Captopril has been shown to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy, and enalapril and lisinopril prevent the development of nephropathy in normoalbuminuric patients with diabetes. ACE inhibitors are generally characterised by flat dose-response curves. Lisinopril is the only ACE inhibitor that exhibits a linear dose-response curve. Despite the fact that most ACE inhibitors are recommended for once-daily administration, only fosinopril, ramipril, and trandolapril have trough-to-peak effect ratios in excess of 50%.",

KD3-671 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg per day) and enalapril (30 mg/kg per day) were given p.o. for 40 days, respectively. KD3-671 (30 mg/kg per day) inhibited the elevation of proteinuria and plasma total cholesterol. On the other hand, enalapril showed only a tendency to diminish these parameters. KD3-671 had an antiproteinuric effect in rats with accelerated passive Heymann nephritis. These findings provide considerable encouragement for the clinical development of KD3-671.",

In the ACE inhibitor-treated group, the hamsters received lisinopril (20 mg/kg per day, p.o.) for 2 weeks after the last injection of adriamycin. The 4-week mortality rates of the vehicle- and ACE inhibitor-treated hamsters were 44% and 12%, respectively. In comparison to the age-matched hamsters used as the control hamsters, a significant decrease in cardiac function and a significant increase in the ratio of the heart weight to the body weight were observed in the vehicle hamsters. Cardiac ACE activity, but not the chymase activity, in the vehicle hamsters was significantly increased in comparison to that in the control hamsters. In the ACE inhibitor-treated group, the increased ACE activity was reduced significantly, and the cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction were improved significantly. In adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathic hamsters, cardiac ACE activity was increased and ACE inhibition significantly improved cardiac function and survival rate, indicating that cardiac ACE, but not the chymase, plays the pivotal role in the development of the adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.", 
    "247": "The present study was designed to clarify the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in modulating renal tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production and to investigate the effect of one dose of Ang II inhibitor on cytokines production following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to cause endotoxemia. Two studies were performed: 1) Ang II was infused intravenously at a rate of 0.2 microg/kg per minute for 4 h in rats and then kidneys were collected to assay TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA levels; 2) Four-week-old Wistar rats pre-treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, or type I Ang II-receptor antagonist, TCV-116, were injected with LPS (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mg, i.p.), and then 2 or 4 h later, kidneys were collected to assay TNF-alpha, IL-6, renin and angiotensinogen mRNA levels. After a 4-h intravenous infusion of Ang II, renal TNF-alpha or IL-6 mRNA level significantly increased 1.9-fold or 2.1-fold (each P<0.05) to the control level, respectively. LPS stimulated TNF-alpha, IL-6 and angiotensinogen mRNA levels in the kidney but in rats given enalapril or TCV-116, LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA levels were completely suppressed (each P<0.05). This suggests that a single dose of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor suppressed renal IL-6 and TNF-alpha production and may prevent cytokine-induced renal damage during endotoxemia.", 
    "248": "Captopril, the classic inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme, was employed in several large clinical studies in recent years. The effect of captopril was compared either with placebo, or captopril was selected as the reference ACE inhibitor for comparison with another therapy. In the classic study SAVE, captopril administered to patients after myocardial infarction with a dysfunction of the left chamber reduced mortality by 19%. Though in the study ELITE the AT1 blocker losartan was more effective to reduce mortality in patients with chronic heart failure than captopril, the larger and mortality-oriented study ELITE II did not demonstrate a difference in mortality reduction between captopril and losartan. ACE inhibitors thus remain drugs of choice in chronic heart failure. AT1 blockers are to be used in the cases when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated. The study CAPPP has demonstrated that captopril in hypertonic patients not only effectively decreases blood pressure but exerts a similar effect on mortality reduction as the classic treatment with a diuretic and a betablocker, the most effective being captopril in diabetic patients. Administration of captopril in hypertonic patients with diabetes mellitus in the study UKPDS had an effect on mortality reduction as well as micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes similar to that of atenolol. The ongoing study VALIANT compares the AT1 blocker valsartan or a combination of valsartan and captopril with captopril alone on patients at risk after myocardial infarction. Also at the beginning of the 21st century captopril maintains a stable position in the treatment of the cardiovascular system.",

    "258": "In the progressive understanding of the heart failure syndrome different models have followed. Current pathophysiology model suggests that heart failure is a neurohormonal disorder: an abnormality in cardiac function and a disturbance in myocardial contractile force is the initiating event in heart failure, and the clinical expression and progression of the disease occurs as a result of subsequent extracardiac alterations. Treatment with drugs capable of antagonizing the effects of neuroendocrine activation, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and antialdosterone agents have induced a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. The progressive understanding of the circulating homeostasis mechanisms moved from the systemic to the paracrine aspects of the neurohormonal systems and contributed to the development of new drugs. Moreover, the analysis of a drug's development can be an important step in the medical knowledge advancement. In this sense, aldosterone and spironolactone became an interesting \"case\", which is analyzed in this paper, going through the steps that have promoted the spironolactone from a weak diuretic to a neurohormonal drug and, finally, to a \"central\" drug.",

The epithelial cells produced a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor, and increased the permeability across the epithelial cells. These findings suggest that these factors and the increased permeability may cause airway inflammation, resulting in the exacerbation of asthma. Glucocorticoid and bafilomycin inhibited RV infection in the epithelial cells by reducing ICAM-1 expression and RV RNA entry from the acidic endosomes to the cytoplasm. Second, we revealed the mechanisms of aspiration pneumonia induced by silent aspiration in patients with cerebral infarction. We also developed a pharmacologic treatment for preventing aspiration pneumonia with amantadine, which stimulates the dopaminergic neurons; the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which decrease substance P catabolism; and cilostazol, which inhibits platelet aggregation and induces cerebral vasodilation. Third, we demonstrated that exhaled carbon monoxide concentrations caused by heme oxygenase-1 upregulation, may be a useful noninvasive means of monitoring airway inflammation and of controlling elderly patients with bronchial asthma. Finally, we demonstrated that microsatellite polymorphism in the heme oxygenase-1 gene promoter is associated with susceptibility to emphysema caused by cigarette smoke in Japanese patients with chronic pulmonary emphysema.", 
    "260": "Studies have shown that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in cardiac remodeling induced by hypertension. However, the role of this system on myocyte remodeling remains unclear. In the present study, we have assessed the effect of perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) as a means to evaluate the role of RAS in myocyte remodeling. We also investigated the effect of beta blockade on myocyte remodeling. We used female SHRs at 12 weeks of age. They were divided into four experimental groups: a control group, group C; low dose perindopril group (0.3 mg/kg/day, p.o.), group PL; high dose perindopril group (3 mg/kg/day, p.o.), group PH; and bisoprolol group (60 mg/kg/day, p.o.), group B. We isolated myocytes from these rats after 4 weeks. LV myocyte volume and cross-sectional area decreased in groups PL and PH compared to group C. LV myocyte length decreased in group PH compared to group C. However, there was no morphological change in LV myocytes in group B compared to group C. In summary, ACE inhibitors reversed cardiac hypertrophy mainly by a reduction in LV myocyte volume; however, beta blockade did not reverse myocyte remodeling. These results suggest that RAS plays an important role in myocyte remodeling in the hypertensive heart.",

Sixty patients, aged 23-75, who had chronic renal disease and stable proteinuria over 0.5 g in 24 h and were receiving an ACEI, were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized to have 8 mg of Candesartan added in the first or second of two 12-week study periods. The primary end point was urine protein excretion, which was measured every 2 weeks for the 24-week period.

We postulated that the administration of terlipressin, an agonist of the vasopressin system, with ephedrine more effectively restores pressure in this setting than the administration of ephedrine alone. This prospective, randomized, cross-over, double-blinded study compared terlipressin combined with ephedrine (n = 19) with ephedrine alone (n = 21) in treating hypotension at the induction of anesthesia in 40 ACEI-treated patients undergoing hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure [MAP] <65 mm Hg or <30% of baseline value) after standardized anesthetic protocol (target-controlled IV anesthesia with propofol). Data are mean +/- SD. Patient characteristics, MAP, and heart rate before and after the induction of anesthesia during hypotensive episodes were not significantly different between the two groups. After the first bolus, MAP was significantly greater in the Terlipressin-Ephedrine group (72 +/- 12 mm Hg versus 65 +/- 8 mm Hg, P < 0.05). The occurrence of a second hypotensive episode (5% versus 71%, P < 0.001), the duration (2 +/- 1 min versus 3 +/- 1 min, P < 0.01) of hypotensive episodes, and the median dose of ephedrine (3 versus 6 mg, P < 0.05) were significantly less in the Terlipressin-Ephedrine group. In conclusion, terlipressin combined with ephedrine is more effective than ephedrine alone for treating anesthesia-induced hypotension in ACEI-treated patients. We conclude that this patient population with a partially blocked endogenous response to hypotension may be good candidates for successful use of a vasopressin analog to counteract intraoperative refractory hypotension.",

    "306": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and are a first-line therapy for chronic heart failure. However, the first-dose may be associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic hypotension. In previous small series with different ACE inhibitors, different blood pressure responses have been reported. We defined hypotension as a fall in mean blood pressure > or = 20 mm Hg and an absolute value of systolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <60 mm Hg. We studied the evolution of mean, systolic and diastolic blood pressure after initiation of perindopril and captopril treatments in a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, comparative, prospective study. One hundred seventy-six patients, mean age 64.9+/-12.1 years, 116 men, with symptomatic heart failure, NYHA class II-IV, and a left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, were randomised to receive a single dose of captopril 6.25 mg (n = 85) or perindopril 2 mg, (n = 91). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded with Dinamap every 15 minutes during a baseline period of 2 hours, every 30 minutes from 2 to 7 hours and at 8 hours after the drug administration. Baseline characteristics of both groups were similar (demography, heart failure aetiology, NYHA class and blood pressure). Throughout the study there were 23 asymptomatic episodes of hypotension in the captopril group and 6 in the perindopril group (p = 0.039). One patient in the captopril group had symptomatic episodes. Mean blood pressure falls were significantly higher in the captopril versus perindopril group at 60 minutes (-4.6 mm Hg vs+0.7 mm Hg; p=0.004), 75 minutes (-4.4 mm Hg vs -1.1 mm Hg; p = 0.042), and 180 minutes (-3.4 mm Hg vs +0.0 mm Hg; p= 0.042). When elderly patients (> or =70 years) were considered the same pattern of response was found. In summary, first-dose hypotension is not negligible on initiation of therapy with ACE inhibitors in heart failure patients with low ejection fraction. Perindopril results in significantly less reduction in blood pressure and a lower incidence of symptomatic or asymptomatic hypotensive episodes and allows a safer start of therapy than captopril in heart failure patients.",

CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) catalyses the final step of aldosterone production. The aim of the present study was to determine whether CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 (11beta-hydroxylase) are expressed in myocardial tissues, and whether these enzymes contribute to collagen accumulation and myocardial dysfunction in the failing human heart. Endomyocardial tissues were obtained from 23 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and 10 controls. CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. The myocardial collagen volume fraction (CVF) was determined by digital planimetry. CYP11B2 mRNA expression was greater in the CHF group than in the controls (P<0.05), while CYP11B1 mRNA was barely expressed in either group. There was a positive correlation between CYP11B2 mRNA levels and CVF (r=0.64, P=0.001). CYP11B2 mRNA was particularly highly expressed in subgroups of CHF patients with a large left ventricular end-systolic diameter (>55 mm) or a low left ventricular ejection fraction (<30%). CYP11B2 mRNA expression and CVF were lower in a CHF subgroup treated with a combination of spironolactone and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) than in a subgroup not treated with these drugs. In conclusion, this study has shown that increased myocardial expression of CYP11B2 mRNA is associated with increased myocardial fibrosis and with the severity of left ventricular dysfunction in human CHF. In addition, CYP11B2 expression and cardiac fibrosis are found to be decreased in CHF patients on drug therapy comprising spironolactone combined with ACEIs.",

The effects of the co-administration of both B1 and B2 kinin receptor antagonists (2.5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) each) with and without omapatrilat were also evaluated to assess the role of bradykinin (BK) during this post-MI period. Both omapatrilat and captopril treatments improve early (4 days) post-MI survival when started 4 h post-MI. The use of kinin receptor antagonists had no significant effect on survival in untreated MI rats and omapatrilat-treated MI rats. This improvement in survival with omapatrilat and captopril is accompanied by a reduced LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and pulmonary congestion. The use of kinin receptor antagonists had little effect on cardiac hemodynamics or morphologic measurements. Acute MI significantly increased the expression of cardiac cytokines (TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, and IL-10). Captopril significantly attenuated this activation, while omapatrilat had variable effects: sometimes increasing but generally not changing activation depending on the cytokine measured and the dose of omapatrilat used. The co-administration of both kinin receptor antagonists attenuates the increase in expression of cardiac TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 after omapatrilat treatment. Taken together, these results would suggest that despite very marked differences in the way these drugs modified the expression of cardiac cytokines, both omapatrilat and captopril improved early (4 days) post-MI survival and cardiac function to a similar extent.",

The Ang II precursor [Pro 11 -D-Ala 12]-Ang I was converted into Ang II by the rat MAB elastase-2 with catalytic efficiency of 8.6 min-1 microM-1, and the chromogenic substrates N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-p-nitroanilide and N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide were hydrolyzed by the enzyme with catalytic efficiencies of 10.6 min-1 microM-1 and 7.6 min-1 microM-1, respectively. The non-cleavable peptide inhibitor CH-5450 inhibited the rat MAB elastase-2 activities toward the substrates Ang I (IC50 = 49 microM) and N-succinly-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (IC 50 = 4.8 microM), whereas N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-chloromethylketone, an effective active site-directed inhibitor of pancreatic elastase-2, efficiently blocked the Ang II-generating activity of the rat MAB enzyme (IC 50 = 4.5 microM). Altogether, the data presented here confirm and extend the enzymological similarities between pancreatic elastase-2 and its rat MAB counterpart. Moreover, the thus far unrealized interaction of elastase-2 with [Pro 11-D-Ala 12]-Ang I and CH-5450, both regarded as selective for chymases, suggests that evidence for the in vivo formation of Ang II by chymases may have been overestimated in previous investigations of Ang II-forming pathways.",

We sought to determine therefore whether the salt sensitive component to the hypertension was associated with a loss of the regulatory effect of dietary sodium on Ang II synthesis. (2) Male SHR were placed on low, intermediate or high salt diets for 4 weeks and their blood pressure recorded. After 4 weeks, blood was collected for determination of renin, angiotensinogen, Ang I, Ang II and aldosterone concentrations, as well as ACE activity.

With the aim to develop compounds that can jointly block the three metallopeptidases-neutral endopeptidase (NEP, neprilysin), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1)-we studied the common structural specificity of the S1' subsites of these peptidases.

    "367": "It has been widely assumed that the cardiac angiotensin-generating system plays an important role in the development and maintenance of cardiac remodeling caused by pressure overload. The roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in rats were investigated. Pressure overload was achieved by constricting the abdominal aorta above the renal arteries. After they underwent surgery, the rats were treated with a low or high dose of the ACE inhibitor imidapril (0.07 and 0.7 mg/kg/d s.c.) with an osmotic pump for 4 weeks. High-dose imidapril prevented the increase in blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Low-dose imidapril inhibited only cardiac fibrosis. ACE activity in the myocardium, but not in serum, was significantly increased in the rats with the banded aorta, and ACE immunoreactivity was increased in the areas of fibrosis. These changes were markedly reduced by both doses of imidapril. These results suggest that the increased local ACE expression contributes to the development of pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis but is not responsible for hypertrophy in rats.", 
    "368": "The investigation of therapeutic actions of angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors (ACEI) demonstrated complex interactions between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) in several experimental and clinical studies. They are evidenced by the fact that (1) ACE efficiently catabolizes kinins; (2) angiotensin-derivatives such as ANG-(1-7) exert kininlike effects; and (3) kallikrein probably serves as a prorenin-activating enzyme. (4) Several authors have demonstrated experimentally that the protective effects of ACEI are at least partly mediated by a direct potentiation of kinin receptor response on BK stimulation. (5) Furthermore, studies on AT1 antagonists, which do not directly influence kinin degradation, and studies on angiotensin-receptor transgenic mice have revealed additional interactions between the RAS and the KKS. There is mounting evidence that an autocrine cascade including kinins, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and cyclic GMP is involved in at least some of the angiotensin type 2 receptor effects. This review discusses multiple possibilities of cross-talks between the RAS and KKS in vascular and cardiac physiology and pathology after ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade.",

The present study was undertaken to clarify whether the renin-angiotensin system contributes to the development of this pressor response to L-NNA. Systemic blood pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored in dogs anaesthetised with pentobarbital. Plasma renin activity in the blood obtained from a femoral artery and a renal vein was measured by use of radioimmunoassay. The acute pressor response produced by the intravenous administration of L-NNA was accompanied by reduced renin activity in both systemic and renal vascular beds. Captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, counteracted the pressor response to L-NNA, whereas candesartan, an angiotensin AT1-receptor antagonist, had no apparent effect on it. The counteraction by captopril of the L-NNA-induced pressor response was likely to be attributable to enhancement by captopril of depressor responses to bradykinin, as HOE-140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, neutralised the effect of captopril. These results suggest that the pressor response acutely produced by the intravenous injection of a NOS inhibitor is not mediated by the renin-angiotensin system in anaesthetised dogs.",

Increasing evidence shows that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs) may be equally effective in delaying progressive renal disease in diabetic patients. Large, multicentre trials are ongoing to confirm the efficacy and superior safety profile of ARBs in this population.",

However, its potential association with differential clinical efficacy of ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) administered to patients who had suffered a myocardial infarction (MI), i.e. the prevention of left ventricular (LV) remodeling, has so far not been specifically studied. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the D/I polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with the incidence of post-MI LV remodeling in patients drawn from the 'Healing and Early Afterload Reducing Therapy' (HEART) Study. The ACE D/I polymorphism was characterized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 265 subjects from the 'Healing and Early Afterload Reducing Therapy' Study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the objective of determining whether early or delayed administration of the ACE-I, ramipril, in patients with acute anterior wall MI would be optimal in reducing LV enlargement. Selected frequencies for the ACE D and I alleles were 0.59 and 0.41 (placebo-high dose group), 0.56 and 0.44 (low dose-low dose group), and, 0.60 and 0.40 (high dose-high dose group), respectively. All observed genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no evidence for an association between genotype and outcome regarding LV size or function, nor with the initial blood pressure response after ACE-I administration (adjusted for covariates). Our data provide no evidence for an association of the ACE D/I polymorphism with the risk of LV remodeling post-MI in the presence of ACE-I therapy, and therefore do not suggest that differential clinical efficacy of ACE-inhibitors is related to this genetic marker.", 
    "372": "1. Diabetes is a major global public health problem. The prevalence of this disease is predicted to increase sharply in the coming decades, particularly in less-developed regions of the world. 2. Most premature morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes relates to markedly increased risks of major cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke (macrovascular events), as well as microvascular complications, such as nephropathy and retinopathy. 3. Hypertension is a prevalent and important risk factor for vascular events in these patients. However, observational data demonstrate a continuous relationship between blood pressure and risk of vascular events, suggesting that even those individuals considered normotensive may benefit from blood pressure lowering. 4. Trials of blood pressure lowering among mostly hypertensive individuals with diabetes have demonstrated benefit of intervention on macrovascular and microvascular outcomes. Recent data may suggest additional effects of angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors independent of blood pressure lowering. 5. Issues where data are lacking with respect to blood pressure lowering in diabetes include the effects of blood pressure lowering among non-hypertensive individuals and the effects of blood pressure lowering regimens based on different classes of drug. 6. Data expected to address some of these issues are being collected. These include a prospective meta-analysis of blood pressure-lowering trials with large numbers of patients with diabetes. A new large-scale randomised trial, ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease), is also described.", 
    "373": "1. The burden of stroke worldwide is growing rapidly, driven by an ageing population and by the rapid rate of urbanization and industrialization in the developing world. There are approximately 5 million fatal and 15 million non-fatal strokes each year and over 50 million survivors of stroke alive, worldwide, today. 2. The most important determinant of stroke risk is blood pressure, with a strong, continuous relationship between the level of the systolic and diastolic pressures and the risk of initial and recurrent stroke, in both Western and Asian populations. 3. Randomized clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that blood pressure lowering reduces the risk of initial stroke by 35-40% in hypertensive patients; but, until recently, there was no conclusive evidence that blood pressure lowering was effective in the secondary prevention of stroke. 4. The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) has provided definitive evidence that blood pressure lowering in patients with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) reduces the incidence of secondary stroke by 28%, of major vascular events by 26% and of major coronary events by 26%. These reductions were all magnified by approximately 50% in a subgroup of patients in whom the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril was routinely combined with the diuretic indapamide. 5. Successful global implementation of a treatment with perindopril and indapamide in patients with a history of stroke or TIA would markedly reduce the burden of stroke and could avert between 0.5 and one million strokes each year, worldwide.", 
    "374": "1. In arterial hypertension, aortic wave reflections contribute to determining central systolic and pulse pressures. The present study assessed the central pressure alterations at the level of the common carotid artery following 1 month treatment with perindopril or atenolol and investigated during the 8 h following drug intake. 2. Twenty patients suffering from permanent hypertension were included after a 4 week run-in placebo period in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study comparing the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril with the beta-blocker atenolol during a 4 week treatment period. 3. Before and during the 8 h after drug intake, serial measurements included brachial artery systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP, respectively; mercury sphygmomanometer), carotid artery SBP and pulse pressure (PP; applanation tonometry), aortic pulse wave velocity (Complior; Colson, Les Lilas, France) and arterial wave reflections from the aorta (applanation tonometry; Sphygmocor; PWV Medical, Sydney, NSW, Australia). 4. Both treatments decreased brachial and carotid artery SBP, DBP and PP. Heart rate and pulse wave velocity decreased following atenolol (P < 0.001). Pulse wave velocity was reduced slightly following perindopril (NS). Arterial wave reflections were significantly (P < 0.001) decreased with perindopril in comparison with atenolol, but this effect on wave reflections was not associated with a larger decrease in carotid artery PP. 5. Thus, during chronic treatment, ACE inhibition and selective beta1-adrenoceptor blockade resulted in a similar decrease in brachial and carotid artery PP, but only atenolol reduced heart rate. Aortic pulse wave velocity was reduced with both drugs, but atenolol appeared more effective in improving aortic stiffness. Arterial wave reflections were decreased only following perindopril. 6. Central pulse pressure was improved following 1 month treatment with an ACE inhibitor or beta-adrenoceptor blockade following a decrease in arterial wave reflections with perindopril and a higher decrease in regional aortic stiffness with atenolol.", 
    "375": "1. Increased sodium intake causes decreased formation of angiotensin (Ang) II and increased AngII causes increased Na+ retention. 2. Increased sodium intake and increased AngII causes cardiac hypertrophy, but decreased sodium intake regresses cardiac hypertrophy despite high AngII levels. Likewise, decreased Na+ and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in neonatal rats have similar effects on subsequent blood pressure development. 3. Cardiac hypertrophy due to renal hypertension does not regress when the RAS is blocked and rats are on a high salt intake. Likewise, sodium restriction alone does not cause regression; combination of reduced NaCl intake and RAS blockade is required. 4. High doses of perindopril and losartan in combination cause a syndrome in rats on 0.2% NaCl that leads to profound hypotension, polyuria, renal impairment and involution of the heart and death. This is reversed or prevented by a high (4%) NaCl intake, which also prevents the plasma angiotensinogen depletion that occurs with combined blockade on 0.2% NaCl intake. 5. Intake of NaCl and AngII interact at many levels. It is postulated that there is an important interaction at the cellular level that can explain the above events.", 
    "376": "1. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has two homologous active N- and C-terminal domains and displays activity towards a broad range of substrates. The tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP) has been shown to be hydrolysed in vitro by ACE and to be a preferential substrate for its N-terminal active site. This peptide reversibly prevents the recruitment of pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells and normal early progenitors into the S-phase. 2. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors, given as a single dose to normal subjects or during long-term treatment in hypertensive patients, result in plasma AcSDKP levels five- to six-fold higher and urine concentrations 40-fold higher than those of control subjects and/or patients. Thus, AcSDKP is a natural peptide hydrolysed by the N-terminal domain of ACE in vivo. In addition, ACE may be implicated in the process of haematopoietic stem cell regulation by permanently degrading this natural circulating inhibitor of cell entry into the S-phase. 3. Besides hydrolysis by ACE, the second very effective mechanism by which AcSDKP is cleared from plasma is glomerular filtration. Because of its high sensitivity and specificity, the measurement of AcSDKP in plasma and urine provides a valuable tool in screening specific inhibitors of the N-terminal domain of ACE and in monitoring ACE inhibition during chronic treatment. 4. The long-term consequences of AcSDKP accumulation are not known. During chronic ACE inhibition in rats, AcSDKP levels slightly increase in organs with high ACE content (kidneys, lungs). To significantly increase its concentration in target haematopoietic organs (the extracellular fraction of bone marrow), AcSDKP has to be infused on top of a captopril-based treatment. 5. A selective inhibitor of the N-domain of ACE in vitro and in vivo has been identified recently. The phosphinic peptide RXP 407 does not interfere with blood pressure regulation, but does increase, dose dependently, plasma concentrations of AcSDKP in mice, in contrast with lisinopril, which affects the metabolism of both AcSDKP and angiotensin I. N-Terminal-selective ACE inhibitors may be used to selectively control AcSDKP metabolism in target haematopoietic organs. This new therapeutic strategy may be of value for protecting haematopoietic cells from the toxicity of cancer chemotherapy.", 
    "377": "1. Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes, including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammation and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. In humans, the plasma and tissue kallikrein-kinin systems (KKS) generate bradykinin and kallidin peptides, respectively. 2. We established methodology for the measurement of bradykinin and kallidin peptides and their metabolites in order to study the function of the plasma and tissue KKS in humans. 3. Bradykinin peptides were more abundant than kallidin peptides in blood and cardiac atrial tissue, whereas kallidin peptides were predominant in urine. The levels of kinin peptides in tissue were higher than in blood, confirming the primary tissue localization of the KKS. 4. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition increased blood levels of bradykinin and kallidin peptides. 5. Blood levels of kallidin peptides were suppressed in patients with severe cardiac failure, indicating that the activity of the tissue KKS is suppressed in this condition. 6. Bradykinin peptide levels were increased in the urine of patients with interstitial cystitis, suggesting a role for these peptides in the pathogenesis and/or symptomatology of this condition. 7. Cardiopulmonary bypass, a model of activation of the contact system, activated both the plasma and tissue KKS. 8. Measurement of individual bradykinin and kallidin peptides and their metabolites gives important information about the operation of the plasma and tissue KKS and their role in physiology and disease states.", 
    "378": "1. The aim of the present study was to investigate left and right ventricular (LV and RV, respectively) coronary vasodilatation reserve (CVR; fluorescent microsphere technique) in rats with hypertension (spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)) or congestive heart failure (CHF) and the effects of early and chronic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade thereupon. 2. In adult SHR, both LV and RV CVR were impaired, especially in the non-hypertrophied RV, the main factor involved being coronary vascular remodelling. Blockade of the RAS normalized both LV and RV CVR, mainly through the prevention of hypertension and suppression of the resulting pericoronary fibrosis. 3. In postischaemic CHF rats, there was an early and severe degradation of LV and RV CVR that developed before any significant vascular remodelling and appeared to be linked to the deterioration of cardiac hypertrophy and haemodynamics. This degradation in CVR further worsened over the longer term due to late-developing pericoronary fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. Blockade of the RAS had no early effects on LV and RV CVR, but improved RV CVR over the long term, mainly by limiting RV hypertrophy and by preventing the development of pericoronary fibrosis and coronary endothelial dysfunction. 4. In kallikrein-kinin system-deficient mice, CVR was not different from that of wild-type mice, suggesting that this system is not implicated in normal CVR regulation.", 
    "379": "Heart failure patients suffer very severe morbidity, high mortality and are common in medical practice. Their need for effective treatments is only partially answered by current options. Effective treatments often address cellular and pathophysiological mechanisms which are involved in the progression of heart failure. This article reviews those mechanisms and treatments.", 
    "380": "The 'Perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study' (PROGRESS) demonstrated that for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack during the previous 5 years, a blood-pressure-lowering regimen based on the combination of a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduces the risk of stroke recurrence (fatal and non-fatal) by 28% (95%-CI: 17-38). This effect was irrespective of the initial neurological diagnosis (ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke) and blood pressure level. Patients who were treated with just the ACE inhibitor did not exhibit these effects. This large-scale clinical trial demonstrates that hypotensive medication in the form of a diuretic combined with an ACE inhibitor is a beneficial strategy for the secondary prevention of stroke in normotensive and hypertensive patients.", 
    "381": "Last year, in 2001, the results of several major clinical trials have been published, concerning hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (IRMA, RENAAL and IDNT studies) and patients with previous strokes. Angiotensin II antagonists (irbesartan and losartan) are able to reduce the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. This preventive effect occurs independently of the stage of renal dysfunction (early stage in IRMA, patent nephropathy in RENAAL and advanced nephropathy in IDNT). The PROGRESS study shows that the decrease in blood pressure, in response to an ACE inhibitor/diuretic bitherapy (perindopril/indapamide), in patients with previous minor stroke or transient ischaemic attack, reduces significantly the risk of recurrent stroke.",

    "383": "This was a randomized, double-blind, ascending-dose, crossover study evaluating 3 doses of BG9719 in 63 patients with congestive heart failure. Patients received placebo or 1 of 3 doses of BG9719 on 1 day and the same medication plus furosemide on a separate day. Renal function and electrolyte and water excretion were assessed. BG9719 alone caused an increase in urine output and sodium excretion (P<0.05). Although administration of furosemide alone caused a large diuresis, addition of BG9719 to furosemide increased diuresis, which was significant at the 0.75-microg/mL concentration. BG9719 alone improved glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the 2 lower doses. Furosemide alone caused a decline in GFR. When BG9719 was added to furosemide, however, creatinine clearance remained at baseline at the 2 lower doses.", 
    "384": "In patients with congestive heart failure on standard therapy, including ACE inhibitors, BG9719 increased both urine output and GFR. In these same patients, furosemide increased urine output at the expense of decreased GFR. When BG9719 was given in addition to furosemide, urine volume additionally increased and there was no deterioration in GFR. A1 adenosine antagonism might preserve renal function while simultaneously promoting natriuresis during treatment for heart failure.", 
    "385": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DMC) is a complication of diabetes mellitus (DM)that is more frequently observed in those patients with microalbuminuria. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) in patients with diabetes, in absence of another etiology that justifies it, is an early marker of DMC. We carried out a prospective study on young diabetic type 1 patients with microalbuminuria, aimed at knowing the effect of captopril on LVDD.", 
    "386": "We included 30 patients (18 males and 12 females) diagnosed with type 1 DM,aged 40 years old, who had been recently found to have microalbuminuria and thus they were candidates to receive captopril. We excluded patients having factors different from DM that could modify the diastolic function. All patients underwent a complete biochemical and echocardiographic study before starting the treatment with captopril and six months later. A diagnosis of LVDD was made when at least one of the following parameters was present in the echocardiographic study: isovolumetric relaxing time (IRT) >100 ms, deceleration time (DT) > 220 ms or early filling rate peak/late filling rate peak ratio (E/A) < 1. According to the results of the second echocardiogram, patients were classified in two groups: improved group (when there was at least a 10% improvement of initial LVDD altered parameters) and non-improved group. A control group of 28 type 1 diabetic patients without microalbuminuria who were not given captopril was included (group C).", 
    "387": "The initial echocardiographic study yielded 11 patients having a normal diastolic function (group FDN) and 19 patients having LVDD (group FDA). After 6 moths of captopril treatment, an improvement of the ratio E/A was observed in the group FDN: from 1.58 (0.36)in the beginning to 1,68 (0.29) six moths later (p < 0.05),and in the group FDA: from 1.09 (0.24) to 1.24 (0.28) (p <0.05). In the group FDA, an improvement of IRT was found: from 110 (16) ms to 99.9 (9.6) ms (p < 0.01). Moreover, in the group FDA, LVDD improved after sixth months in 15 (78.9%) patients but not in 4 (21,6%). This LVDD improvement was associated with a decrease of the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP) at the end of the study. A logistic regression analysis showed an independent association between the reduction of the mean SBP and the improvement of LVDD.", 
    "388": "Our results suggest that captopril can improve LVDD in young patients with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria, possibly due to a decrease of blood pressure.", 
    "389": "In summary, the present information on treating hypertension in the diabetic overwhelmingly indicates a compelling need to lower BP to target diastolic BP of 80 mmHg or less, to be less concerned about the types of drugs used than the blood pressures achieved and the concordance with therapy and to rely on two or more antihypertensive drugs in the majority of cases. Management of the hypertensive diabetic is very cost-effective. It is clear that we must engage in total cardiovascular risk management if we are to prevent the microvascular and macrovascular complications in the hypertensive diabetic (or the diabetic hypertensive).", 
    "390": "Resuscitative interventions that improve mesenteric perfusion without causing instability in systemic arterial pressures may be helpful for improving trauma patient outcomes. Blocking angiotensin II formation with enalaprilat may be such an intervention. Two questions were addressed in this two-part study investigating resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock in dogs: Can systemic arterial pressures be maintained while administering a constant rate infusion of enalaprilat during resuscitation, and can enalaprilat improve cardiovascular status during resuscitation? Animals were hemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 to 45 mmHg for 30 min and then 30 to 35 mmHg for 30 min. Group I (n = 5) was resuscitated to a MAP 60 to 65 mmHg with enalaprilat (0.02 mg/kg/h). Group II was resuscitated to a MAP 40 to 45 mmHg with (n = 5) or without (n = 5) enalaprilat. Resuscitation in both groups consisted of intermittent intravenous lactated Ringer's solution (60 mL/kg/h) to reach and maintain the target MAPs. Systemic arterial pressures were unaffected by enalaprilat during resuscitation in Group I, allowing us to proceed to the second study. During severely hypotensive resuscitation (Group II), systemic arterial pressures were also stable and enalaprilat administration was associated with increases (P < or = 0.02) in cardiac index (+1.2 L/min/m2), stroke volume index (SVI) (+14.5 mL/m2), superior mesenteric artery flow (+80 mL/min), stroke work (+561 mmHg/mL/m2), and left ventricular power output (+55.7 mmHg/L/min/m2). Corresponding increases were not observed in controls. We conclude that administration of a constant rate infusion of enalaprilat during resuscitation can be accomplished without causing a hypotensive crisis. Since enalaprilat significantly improved cardiovascular status including mesenteric perfusion even during intentional hypotension, it has potential value for improving the treatment of trauma patients.",

The greatest rise in LV EF, reduction of the end diastolic volume, end systolic volume of the left ventricle and functional class was observed in group 1. In group 2 these parameters changed less than in group 3. Patients of groups 2 and 4 were similar by parameters of LV global contractility.",

    "395": "The human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene contains a length polymorphism consisting of the presence (insertion, I) or absence (deletion, D) of a 287 base pair \"Alu\" repeat sequence in intron 16, with the D allele being associated with higher ACE levels than the I allele in plasma and in tissues. We have carried out several studies to examine the relationship between this polymorphism and cardiovascular health, and have examined the hypothesis that if renin-angiotensin systems regulate left ventricular (LV) growth, individuals of DD genotype might show a greater hypertrophic response than those of II genotype. A strategy was used involving screening over 1200 male military recruits to select only subjects homozygous for the I or D allele for the expensive and time-consuming but extremely accurate method of LV mass determination by magnetic resonance imaging. LV dimensions and mass were compared at the start and end of a 10-week physical training period. LV mass increased with training by 8.4 g overall (p < 0.0001), but with DD men showing roughly 3 fold greater growth than II men (p < 0.001). When indexed to lean body mass, LV growth in II subjects was essentially negligible whilst remaining significant in DD subjects (-0.022 vs +0.131 g/kg respectively, p = 0.0009). Although the precise molecular mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated it clearly demonstrates the importance of the ACE-renin-angiotensin system in determining LV dimensions in situations of high cardiac demand, which may also be important in pathology such as hypertension and heart failure. The use of these \"stress-the-genotype\" approaches to explore gene-environment interactions are likely to be the key to understanding the causes determining both coronary artery disease and other multi-factorial disorders.", 
    "396": "Current guidelines recommend drugs which reduce neurohormonal activation as standard therapy for heart failure: angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) tested the efficacy of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan in addition to prescribed therapy. A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of NYHA class II, III or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. Further angiotensin antagonism by valsartan did not improve survival but was beneficial in terms of morbidity and mortality, because of reduced rate of hospitalization, significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life. Valsartan had highly favourable effects in patients not receiving ACE inhibitors but an adverse effect in patients receiving both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. The effects of adding valsartan are depending on the importance of previous neurohormonal inhibition.",

One hundred forty-six patients were withdrawn before randomization. Nonresponders (n = 327) were double blind and randomized to 40 mg telmisartan + 12.5 mg HCTZ (n = 160) or 40 mg telmisartan (n = 167). After 8 weeks of treatment, 40 mg telmisartan + 12.5 mg HCTZ lowered diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by an additional 3.5 mm Hg (P <.01) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 7.4 mm Hg (P <.01) compared with 40 mg telmisartan. Most of the additional effect of the combination was seen after 4 weeks of treatment. At week 8, blood pressure was normalized (SBP <140 mm Hg and DBP <90 mm Hg) in 51.6% of patients on 40 mg telmisartan + 12.5 mg HCTZ compared with 23.5% on 40 mg telmisartan (P <.05). The combination of 40 mg telmisartan + 12.5 mg HCTZ normalized DBP in 64.8% of patients, whereas 40 mg telmisartan normalized DBP in 40.1% (P <.05). SBP decreased by > or =10 mm Hg from baseline in 63.5% of patients receiving the fixed-dose combination compared with 42.6% of those receiving 40 mg telmisartan (P <.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Adverse events were predominantly mild, transient, and considered unrelated to therapy. These findings indicate that a fixed-dose combination of 40 mg telmisartan + 12.5 mg HCTZ is clinically and statistically superior to 40 mg telmisartan in patients with mild to moderate hypertension failing to respond to 40 mg telmisartan alone.", 
    "401": "The objective of the study was to assess the factors related to the occurrence of microalbuminuria during the follow-up of a young adult group with essential hypertension that had not been previously treated. Normo-albuminuric essential hypertensives, <50 years old, who had not been previously treated with antihypertensive drugs and who did not have diabetes mellitus were included. After the initial evaluation, patients were treated using only nonpharmacological measures (n=62), beta-blockers (n=38), ACE inhibitors (n=64), calcium channel blockers (n=8), and several classes (n=15). Measurements were taken for office blood pressure, biochemical profile, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion at the beginning of the study and were measured yearly during an average of 2.7+/-1.2 years of follow-up. Among the 187 patients included, 22 (11,7%) developed microalbuminuria (progressors, 4.4/100 patients/y). No differences were present between progressors and those who remained normo-albuminuric (nonprogressors) in terms of age, gender, body mass index, disease duration, blood pressure values, biochemical profile, familial history of diabetes or hypertension, smoking habits, or the presence of EKG left ventricular hypertrophy. The group with the lowest progression rate was the patients treated with ACE inhibitors (n=5; 2.9/100 patients/y), followed by the diet group (n=5; 3.3/100 patients/y) and the beta-blockers group (n=5; 4.1/100 patients/y). When we excluded patients treated with calcium channel blockers or those who changed over time between different classes of treatment, no significant differences in the incidence of microalbuminuria were observed among the groups. Progressors showed higher slopes of fasting glucose (4.78+/-11.4 versus 0.50+/-6.8 mg/y, P<0.02) and uric acid (0.58+/-0.93 versus 0.05+/-1.10 mg/y, P<0.03) compared with the slopes of nonprogressors. Both the slopes for glucose and systolic blood pressure over time were associated independently with the slope of the logarithm of urinary albumin excretion when adjusted for age, gender, and treatment groups. Cox proportional hazard model for progression of microalbuminuria showed that baseline urinary albumin excretion (risk ratio [RR]=1.06; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.01 to 1.11), slope for systolic blood pressure (RR=1.11; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.20), and slope for glucose (RR=1.08; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.14) were independently associated to the development of microalbuminuria. In conclusion, in a group of young adults with essential hypertension that had not been previously treated, the main factors influencing the occurrence of microalbuminuria during antihypertensive treatment were the values of microalbuminuria at baseline and the slopes for systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose.",

Major end points were worsening HF, change in left ventricular ejection fraction and treadmill time after randomization. The primary analysis investigated the relationship between SDC at randomization and these end points. A secondary categorical analysis compared these end points in patients who discontinued digoxin versus patients who continued digoxin and had low (0.5 to 0.9 ng/ml), moderate (0.9 to 1.2 ng/ml) or high (>1.2 ng/ml) SDCs at randomization.",

    "407": "Tachykinin-related peptides (TRP) are widely distributed in the CNS of insects, where they are likely to function as transmitters/modulators. Metabolic inactivation by membrane ecto-peptidases is one mechanism by which peptide signalling is terminated in the CNS. Using locustatachykinin-1 (LomTK-1, GPSGFYGVRamide) as a substrate and several selective peptidase inhibitors, we have compared the types of membrane associated peptidases present in the CNS of four insects, Locusta migratoria, Leucophaea maderae, Drosophila melanogaster and Lacanobia oleracea. A neprilysin (NEP)-like activity cleaving the G-F peptide bond was the major LomTK-1-degrading peptidase detected in locust brain membranes. NEP activity was also found in Leucophaea brain membranes, but the major peptidase was an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), cleaving the G-V peptide bond. Drosophila adult head and larval neuronal membranes cleaved the G-F and G-V peptide bonds. Phosphoramidon inhibited both these cleavages, but with markedly different potencies, indicating the presence in the fly brain of two NEP-like enzymes with different substrate and inhibitor specificity. In Drosophila, membrane ACE did not make a significant contribution to the cleavage of the G-V bond. In contrast, ACE was an important membrane peptidase in Lacanobia brain, whereas very little neuronal NEP could be detected. A dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) that removed the GP dipeptide from the N-terminus of LomTK-1 was also found in Lacanobia neuronal membranes. This peptidase was a minor contributor to LomTK-1 metabolism by neuronal membranes from all four insect species. In Lacanobia, LomTK-1 was also a substrate for a deamidase that converted LomTK-1 to the free acid form. However, the deamidase was not an integral membrane protein and could be a lysosomal contaminant. It appears that insects from different orders can have different complements of neuropeptide-degrading enzymes. NEP, ACE and the deamidase are likely to be more efficient than the common DPP IV activity at terminating neuropeptide signalling since they cleave close to the C-terminus of the tachykinin, a region essential for maintaining biological activity.", 
    "408": "Antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are becoming increasingly popular agents in treating patients with systemic hypertension and minimizing organ damage. In the present study, we compared the effects of eprosartan, an AT(1) receptor inhibitor, with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide in a group of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients with multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis. The subjects were monitored and tested at 0 and 4 weeks to determine their individual effects on vascular and inflammatory markers. Although blood pressure reduction was comparable between the 2 agents, there were notable differences in their effects on markers of inflammation and oxidation. We observed a 28% reduction in neutrophil superoxide anion generating capacity, a 34% reduction in soluble monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and a 35% reduction in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule with eprosartan therapy (all p <0.05 from the start of therapy). In addition, eprosartan showed further benefit in its ability to increase low-density lipoprotein oxidation lag time, suggesting an increased resistance to oxidation and/or modification of low-density lipoprotein. Although hydrochlorothiazide was effective in blood pressure reduction, there were no significant changes in any of the above parameters after 4 weeks of treatment. These findings suggest that eprosartan, an AT(1) receptor inhibitor, effectively reduces systemic blood pressure and, compared with hydrochlorothiazide, suggests additional benefits in the vasculature by inhibiting mechanisms of inflammation and oxidation.", 
    "409": "Microalbuminuria (MA) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and lipid abnormalities in people with type 2 diabetes. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) reduce MA and are neutral on total cholesterol and triglycerides. The effect of ACE inhibitors and CCBs on lipid subfractions such as Lp(a), apolipoprotein (apo) A1, apo B, and others, however, is unclear. The current study tests the hypothesis that a fixed-dose combination of an ACE inhibitor, benazepril (B) with the dihydropyridine CCB, amlodipine (A), will further reduce arterial pressure and reduce atherogenic lipid fractions compared to either agent alone.", 
    "410": "A multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel group design was used to study 27 participants with type 2 diabetes. Measurements for total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL), triglycerides, apo A1, apo B, Lp(a), MA, arterial pressure and creatinine clearance were obtained at baseline and at 12-week intervals during the 36 week study.", 
    "411": "Arterial pressure was significantly reduced at 36 weeks in all three groups (P = 0.0078 for A, P = 0.0039 for B, and P = 0.0313 for A+B). MA was lowered in all groups with relatively greater reductions in the B (P < 0.05) and A+B groups (P < 0.03) vs A. An increase in mean HDL-cholesterol from baseline was noted in the B and A+B groups; P < 0.05), but not in the A group. A trend was also observed between the rise in HDL-cholesterol and the reduction in MA in the B and A+B groups. Additionally, only the B group exhibited a decrease in the median value of Lp(a) (P < 0.05).", 
    "412": "These data support the concept that ACE inhibition with B reduces the atherogenic profile by decreasing Lp(a) and increasing HDL-cholesterol, the latter being correlated with reductions in MA. While A+B exhibited similar trends in lipid subfractions and MA as B, this group had the greatest reduction in systolic blood pressure of the three groups. Thus, use of A+B offers the benefits of a decreased atherogenic profile with a higher probably of achieving goal blood pressure as recommended by national guidelines.", 
    "413": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a central role in the development of hypertension and the progression of end-organ damage. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists can initially suppress plasma aldosterone, it is now well established that aldosterone escape may occur, whereby aldosterone levels return to or exceed baseline levels. The classic effects of aldosterone relate mainly to its action on epithelial cells to regulate water and electrolyte balance. However, blood pressure reduction or fluid loss could not account for the results of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study, which showed that a low dose of spironolactone in addition to conventional therapy could decrease the overall risk of mortality by 30% among patients with severe congestive heart failure. The action of aldosterone at nonepithelial sites in the brain, heart, and vasculature is consistent with the presence of mineralocorticoid receptors in these tissues. Aldosterone has a number of deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system, including myocardial necrosis and fibrosis, vascular stiffening and injury, reduced fibrinolysis, endothelial dysfunction, catecholamine release, and production of cardiac arrhythmias. Several studies have now shown vascular and target-organ protective effects of aldosterone receptor antagonism in the absence of significant blood pressure lowering, consistent with a major role for endogenous mineralocorticoids as mediators of cardiovascular injury. The advent of selective aldosterone receptor antagonists such as eplerenone should prove of great therapeutic value in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and associated end-organ damage.",

    "415": "In order to evaluate the possibility that clinically used cardioactive drugs may exert neuroendocrine influences on somatotroph secretion, we studied the effects of pretreatment with enalapril (20 mg/day orally for 3 days), furosemide (20 mg i.v. as a bolus at -5 minutes) or digoxin (0.25 mg orally 4x/day for 3 days) on the GH response to growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (1.0 microg/ kg i.v. as a bolus at 0 minutes) in 12 healthy male adults (age [mean +/- SEM] 30.2 +/- 1.4 years; BMI 22.7 +/- 0.7 kg/ m2). In a subgroup of 8 subjects the same study was performed testing the GH response to GHRH + arginine (ARG; 0.5 g/kg i.v. from 0 to + 30 minutes). RESULTS The GH response to GHRH (1,304.1 +/- 248-5 microg/l/h) was not modified by enalapril (1,368.7 +/- 171.2 microg/l/h) or by furosemide (1,269.3 +/- 185.2 microg/l/h) but was significantly blunted by digoxin (613.6 +/- 73.2 microg/l/h, P < 0.05). On the other hand digoxin, enalapril and furosemide did not modify the GH response to GHRH +ARG.", 
    "416": "Digoxin, but not enalapril or furosemide, inhibits the GH response to GHRH in normal subjects. The blunting effect of digoxin on the GHRH-induced GH response is counteracted by arginine. These findings show that digoxin possesses an inhibitory effect on somatotroph secretion that may be mediated at the hypothalamic level.", 
    "417": "The multidrug transporter MDR1 (P-glycoprotein)-mediated interaction between digoxin and 29 antihypertensive drugs of various types was examined by using the MDR1 overexpressing LLC-GA5-COL150 cells, which were established by transfecting MDR1 cDNA into porcine kidney epithelial LLC-PK1 cells. These cells construct monolayers with tight junctions, and enable the evaluation of transcellular transport. The MDR1 was highly expressed on the apical membrane (urine side). The basal-to-apical and apical-to-basal transcellular transport of [3H]digoxin in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells was time- and temperature-dependent. The basal-to-apical transport of [3H]digoxin was markedly increased, whereas the apical-to-basal transport was decreased in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells, compared with the host LLC-PK1 cells, suggesting that [3H]digoxin was a substrate for MDR1. Most of the Ca2+ channel blockers used here markedly inhibited basal-to-apical transport and increased apical-to-basal transport. Exceptions were diltiazem, nifedipine and nitrendipine, which hardly showed inhibitory effects on transcellular transport of [3H]digoxin. Alpha-blocker doxazosin and beta-blocker carvedilol also inhibited transcellular transport of [3H]digoxin, but none of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonists used here were active. These observations will promote understanding of the digoxin-drug interactions resulting from their actions on MDR1, and which may aid in avoiding these unexpected effects of digoxin.",

    "421": "It has been suggested that the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be less in black patients than in other racial groups. Retrospective reanalyses of major heart failure trials have suggested that black patients may not realize a significant benefit in morbidity or mortality when heart failure is managed with ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. It has also been suggested that black patients may respond more favorably than non-black patients to the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.", 
    "422": "Published reanalyses of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker trials in heart failure provide weak data to support a lack of benefit in black patients.

    "423": "We investigated the total urinary kallikrein levels, left-ventricular wall thickness and mean arterial blood pressure of nontreated and captopril-treated diabetic and nondiabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats. The mean arterial blood pressure was significantly elevated in diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats as compared to nondiabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats. Captopril treatment caused a significant reduction in the arterial blood pressure of both nondiabetic and diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats. The left-ventricular wall thickness was also significantly reduced in diabetic and nondiabetic spontaneously hypertensive treated with captopril as compared to nontreated diabetic and nondiabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats. The total urinary kallikrein levels were significantly raised in captopril-treated diabetic and nondiabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats against the values obtained from nontreated diabetic and nondiabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats. These results indicate that blood pressure reduction and left ventricular wall regression with captopril treatment might be due to enhanced renal kallikrein formation. The significance of these findings is discussed.", 
    "424": "Experimental studies have shown an activation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) system as a response to endothelial injury. Recent publications have elucidated the hypothesis that the ACE gene polymorphism may influence the level of late luminal loss after coronary stent implantation. It is still unclear whether the polymorphism of the angiotensin gene is a major predictor of the extent of neointimal hyperplasia. In this multicenter study, we therefore tested the relationship between the ACE gene polymorphism and the restenosis rate after coronary stent implantation.", 
    "425": "As a substudy of the optimization with intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS) to reduce stent restenosis (OPTICUS) study, we analyzed ACE serum levels and the ACE gene polymorphism in 154 patients at 9 different centers. All patients underwent elective coronary stent implantation in a stenosis of a major coronary vessel. Balloon inflations were repeated until a satisfactory result was achieved in on-line quantitative coronary angiography or ICUS fulfilling the OPTICUS study criteria. After follow-up of 6 months, all patients underwent reangiography under identical projections as the baseline procedure. A blinded quantitative analysis of the initial procedure as well as the follow-up examinations were performed by an independent core laboratory. ACE gene polymorphism and ACE serum activity were measured at the 6-month follow-up in a double-blinded setting.", 
    "426": "With respect to the ACE gene polymorphism, there were three subgroups: DD genotype (48 patients), ID (83 patients) and II (23 patients). The subgroups did not differ in regard to age, gender, extent of coronary artery disease, stenosis length, initial degree of stenosis or degree of stenosis after stent implantation. In all, 39 patients (25.3%) had significant restenosis: 12 DD patients (25.0%), 18 ID patients (21.7%) and 9 II patients (39.1%) (odds ratio 2.164, 95% confidence interval 0.853-5.493). We obtained the following results for ACE serum levels: 0.53 micromol/l/s in the DD subgroup, 0.29 micromol/l/s in the ID subgroup and 0.09 micromol/l/s in the II subgroup (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the influence of ACE gene polymorphism on the restenosis rate after coronary stent implantation adjusted for lesion length (>12 mm), ACE inhibitor or hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (CSE) inhibitor treatment, age, male gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, high cholesterol, family history, smoking and three-vessel disease did not uncover any statistic significance.", 
    "427": "In contrast to other study groups, we were unable to disclose that the DD polymorphism of the ACE gene was associated with a higher rate of restenosis after coronary stent implantation in this multicenter study. In addition, patients with higher ACE serum levels did not show a higher restenosis rate in this trial. We conclude that the pathogenesis of restenosis is a multifactorial process involving various genetic and nongenetic factors.", 
    "428": "In January 1997, reference pricing for angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for patients 65 years of age or older was introduced in British Columbia, Canada. For medications within a specific class, insurance covers the cost up to the reference price, and patients pay the extra cost of more expensive medications. Although reference pricing may reduce the costs of prescription drugs, there is concern that patients may switch to less effective medications or stop treatment.", 
    "429": "We analyzed data from the Ministry of Health on all 37,362 residents of British Columbia who were 65 or older and were enrolled in the provincial health insurance program, received ACE inhibitors priced higher than the reference price of $27 a month in 1996, and were potentially affected by the new policy. We identified 5353 residents who switched to an ACE inhibitor not subject to cost sharing during the first six months and compared them with 27,938 residents who received only ACE inhibitors subject to cost sharing.", 
    "430": "Reference pricing for ACE inhibitors was not associated with changes in the rates of visits to physicians, hospitalizations, admissions to long-term care facilities, or mortality. The probability of stopping antihypertensive therapy decreased as compared with the probability before the change in policy (relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 0.89). Eighteen percent of patients who had been prescribed ACE inhibitors subject to cost sharing switched to lower-priced alternatives. As compared with patients who did not switch, those who did had a moderate transitory increase in the rates of visits to physicians (rate ratio, 1.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.15) and hospital admissions through the emergency room (rate ratio, 1.19; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.42) during the two months after switching, but not subsequently.",

    "432": "Reduced activity of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) may be involved in thrombus formation on atherosclerotic plaques, a major cause of acute coronary syndrome. However, mechanisms of such increase in arterial thrombogenecity have not been fully understood. We previously reported that long-term inhibition of NO synthesis by administration of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) causes hypertension and activates vascular tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. We used this model to investigate the mechanism by which long-term impairment of NO activity increases arterial thrombogenecity. We observed cyclic flow variations (CFVs), a reliable marker of platelet thrombi, after the production of stenosis of the carotid artery in rats treated with L-NAME for 4 wk. The thrombin antagonist argatroban suppressed the CFVs. The CFVs were detected in rats receiving L-NAME plus hydralazine but not in rats receiving L-NAME plus an ACE inhibitor (imidapril). Treatment with the ACE inhibitor imidapril, but not with hydralazine, prevented L-NAME-induced increases in carotid arterial ACE activity and attenuated tissue factor expression. These results suggest that long-term inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis may increase arterial thrombogenecity at least in part through angiotensin II-induced induction of tissue factor and the resultant thrombin generation. These data provide a new insight as to how endothelial NO exhibits antithrombogenic properties of the endothelium.",

Groups of six hearts were subjected to global ischemia (30 min) followed by reperfusion (30 min) and exposed to no drug and no ischemia-reperfusion (control), ischemia-reperfusion and no drug, and ischemia-reperfusion with losartan (an AT(1)R antagonist; 1 micromol/l), PD-123319 (an AT(2)R antagonist; 0.3 micromol/l), N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA, a cardioprotective adenosine A(1) receptor agonist; 0.5 micromol/l as positive control), enalaprilat (an ANG-converting enzyme inhibitor; 1 micromol/l), PD-123319 + losartan, ANG II (1 nmol/l), or ANG II + losartan. Compared with controls, ischemia-reperfusion decreased AT(2)R protein (Western immunoblots) and mRNA (Northern immunoblots, RT-PCR) and impaired functional recovery. PD-123319 increased AT(2)R protein and mRNA and improved functional recovery. Losartan increased AT(1)R mRNA (but not AT(1)R/AT(2)R protein) and impaired recovery. Other groups (except CHA) did not improve recovery. The results suggest that, in isolated working hearts, AT(2)R plays a significant role in ischemia-reperfusion and AT(2)R blockade induces increased AT(2)R protein and cardioprotection.",

An NDA for the use of omapatrilat in hypertension was filed with the FDA and the regulatory authorities in the EU in December 1999 [351207], [353287]. In April 2000, BMS voluntarily withdrew the NDA in response to questions raised by the FDA regarding the comparative incidence and severity of an infrequent side effect (angioedema) reported within the NDA database. Prospective controlled clinical studies in patients with hypertension and heart failure were to continue. In May 2001, BMS reported that its blinded omapatrilat hypertension study was continuing and, pending supportive results from a data analysis anticipated in late summer/early autumn 2001, the company expected to refile an NDA with the FDA [409203]. In July 2000, BMS reported that it planned to conduct a multinational, 25,000 patient study (OCTAVE - Omapatrilat Cardiovascular Treatment Assessment Versus Enalapril) to compare the efficacy and safety of omapatrilat against enalapril in the treatment of hypertension [374909]. The OCTAVE trial was expected to generate data by mid-2001, which could allow for a launch by early 2002 [380280]. Phase III trials for hypertension had commenced by January 1998 [273646]. In January 2001, Merrill Lynch expected BMS to refile its NDA with the FDA in the second half of 2001 [395423]. In February 2001, Credit Suisse First Boston made a similar prediction, adding that it believed BMS would launch the drug in late 2002 or early 2003. The analysts also predicted peak sales for the drug of $585 million in 2005 [399484]. In May 2001, Merrill Lynch estimated sales of $1.8 billion in 2005 [411811].",

    "459": "Captopril-stimulated renography is widely used to screen selected groups of hypertensive patients for renal vascular disease. Evaluation of the test is a complex task. Lack of interobserver agreement on the assessment and interpretation of renographic parameters may contribute to differences in sensitivity and specificity between studies.", 
    "460": "Three experienced nuclear medicine physicians evaluated 658 renograms of 503 hypertensive patients suspected of having renal vascular disease from a large Dutch multicenter study (the Dutch Renal Artery Stenosis Intervention Cooperative [DRASTIC] study). Interobserver agreement on several renographic parameters was assessed by the kappa statistic and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).", 
    "461": "The interobserver agreement on the time to excretion was high: The pooled ICC was 0.90. The pooled kappa was > or = 0.65 for the pattern of the time--activity curves, the visual aspect of the scintigraphic images (visible uptake and kidney size), and the judgment on the presence of renal artery stenosis. However, the interobserver agreement on cortical retention and pelvic retention by visual inspection of the images was rather low (pooled kappa = 0.46 and 0.52, respectively). Pelvic retention was found to complicate the interpretation of renography.", 
    "462": "Interobserver agreement on most of the renographic parameters was satisfactory, but the assessment of cortical retention was more difficult, in particular, in the presence of pelvic retention. Captopril renography should be interpreted with caution if pelvic retention is suspected. Interobserver variability offers one of several explanations for the differences in diagnostic test performance that are found between studies.", 
    "463": "The effects of chronic treatment with losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, and benazepril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on target-organ damage and abnormal circadian blood pressure (BP) rhythm were compared in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Losartan and benazepril were given by intraperitoneal infusion for 3 weeks after 17 weeks of age to minimize any influence of their different pharmacokinetic properties. BP was continuously monitored by telemetrical method before treatment and at the end of the observation period. The left ventricular (LV) weight, 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UalbV) and morphological changes in the kidney were observed. Losartan and benazepril (1, 3 and 10 mg/day) reduced BP and LV weight in a dose-dependent manner with good correlation between the effects. Losartan significantly improved UalbV in a dose-dependent manner, whereas benazepril was effective at only 10 mg/day. Renal morphological analysis showed that reduction of glomerulosclerosis and collagen fiber thickness was related to the effect on UalbV, but not to the antihypertensive effects. Losartan improved the shifted circadian BP rhythm towards the active phase in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the improvement caused by 1 and 3 mg/day of benazepril was less effective than the same dosage of losartan. These results suggest that both losartan and benazepril can reduce cardiac hypertrophy showing good correlation with their antihypertensive effects, but losartan, especially at a low dose, alleviates renal damage more effectively than benazepril, with its effect correlating well with improvement of the abnormal circadian BP rhythm in SHRSP. Thus, the protective effect against hypertensive target organ damage of the AT1 receptor antagonist seems to be more effective than that of ACE inhibitor.", 
    "464": "Angioneurotic oedema is one of rare side effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, its incidence is around 0.1-0.2%. Angio-oedema most commonly develops in the first 4 weeks of the treatment, but it can be observed later, after several months or even years. The association between the oedema and the drug intake can be difficult to recognize if the oedema is of delayed type and because the attacks can disappear spontaneously without discontinuation of the drug. The angioneurotic oedema is tend to be worsening during the treatment, and finally the obstruction of the upper respiratory tract can be fatal. The affected sites are the face, lips, tongue, upper respiratory tract, and the oedema can also develop in the gastrointestinal tract with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which can be misdiagnosed. The pathomechanism is thought to be rather biochemical than immunological. The pathogenetic factors are under investigation nowadays, but the increased level of bradykinin seems to be the most important factor. Authors treated 248 patients with angioneurotic oedema in the Department of Dermatology (Semmelweis Hospital, Miskolc) between January of 1997 and December of 2000, 44 patients took angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and 16 patients were suspected as suffering from angio-oedema induced by this drug. All of the patients remained symptom-free after the adequate treatment and discontinuation of the suspected drug. Authors describe the clinical picture of the angio-oedema, the risk factors, and the contraindications of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment.", 
    "465": "To investigate whether endothelin-A receptors and nitric oxide modulate renal hemodynamics in man under angiotensin II receptor-1 blockade, 6 healthy volunteers, on a 240 mmol Na diet, underwent 4 separate renal hemodynamic measurements, in 3 of which endothelin-A blocker BQ-123 0.2 nmol.kg.min(-1) was infused for 90 minutes after pretreatment with either placebo, telmisartan 1 mg.kg center dot day(-1) for 3 days, or telmisartan as well, but with co-infusion of both BQ-123 and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester 0.5 microg.kg center dot min(-1). A fourth infusion was made with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester alone. No change followed infusion of either N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester alone or BQ-123 alone. With BQ-123 after telmisartan, renal blood flow rose from 916 +/- 56 mL center dot min(-1) center dot 1.73 m(2) to 1047 +/- 51.2 (P<0.001), and renal vascular resistances fell from 89 +/- 7 mm Hg center dot min center dot L(-1) to 74 +/-4 (P<0.001). These changes were fully abolished by the co-infused N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester. Infusion of BQ-123, devoid of renal hemodynamic effects at baseline, produces significant renal vasodilation when angiotensin II receptors are blocked, indicating an increasing renal hemodynamic role of endothelin-A--receptor activity. Because such a vasodilation is prevented by nonvasoconstricting microdoses of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester, nitric oxide--endothelin balance controls substantially renal hemodynamics under angiotensin II blockade. These findings are consistent with a rationale of the association of endothelin-A blockers with angiotensin II blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in treating nitric oxide--deficient conditions such as arterial hypertension, heart failure, and chronic renal diseases.", 
    "466": "Repeated bouts of ischemia in the heart lead to fibrosis and eventually to heart failure. Although certain genes, such as SOD or hemoxygenase and antisense to AT(1)R, ACE, and (beta(1)-AR can provide short-term protection of the heart from ischemia, there is no known mechanism for constantly responding to repeated incidences of ischemia. We hypothesized that a \"vigilant vector,\" designed to be expressed specifically in the heart and switch on therapeutic genes only during hypoxia, would provide cardioprotection. To attain cardiac specificity, we inserted an MLC2v promoter into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) designed to deliver AS to AT(1)R and gfp. In in vitro experiments in cardiomyocytes (H9C2 cells), the MLC2v-AAV-gfp drove gene expression in all cells at levels comparable to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. In in vivo experiments, the rAAV-MLC2v-gfp was injected intravenously into mice or rats. Green fluorescence protein (GFP) DNA was located in kidney, heart (right and left ventricle), lung, adrenal and spleen. GFP mRNA, however, was expressed only in the heart and absent in other tissues. To switch on the rAAV transgene during ischemia, we inserted a hypoxia response element (HRE). This upregulates transcription when O(2) levels are low. Thus, there are 4 components to the vigilant vector; a gene switch (HRE), a heart-specific promoter (MLC2v), a therapeutic gene (AS-AT(1)R) and a reporter gene (gfp). To silence or lower basal level of expression while retaining specificity, we have reduced the length of the MLC2v promoter from 3 kb to 1775 bp or 281 bp. The truncated promoter is equally effective in heart specific expression. Preliminary studies with the rAAV-HRE-gfp in vitro show an increased expression in 1% O(2) in 4 to 6 hours. By adding additional hypoxia-inducible factor (HIFalpha) (5 microg), the MLC2v-gfp expression is increased by 4-fold in 1% O(2). Further amplification of the gene to 400-fold in 1% O(2) can be achieved with a double plasmid. The construct may serve as a prototype \"vigilant vector\" to switch on therapeutic genes in specific tissue with physiological signals.", 
    "467": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by improving coronary perfusion, reducing ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling, and preventing progression of coronary atherosclerosis. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of ACEi are not fully understood. We studied the in vivo effects of ACE inhibition with perindopril on cellular expression of ACE, AT(1) receptors and 2 nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, endothelial (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS), in human blood vessels using quantitative in vitro autoradiography and immunocytochemistry. Seven patients with ischemic heart disease were treated with perindopril (4 mg/d) for up to 5 weeks before elective coronary bypass surgery, whereas controls did not receive the ACEi (n=7). Perindopril decreased plasma ACE by 70% and the plasma angiotensin II to angiotensin I ratio by 57% and reduced vascular ACE to approximately 65% of control levels in both endothelium and adventitia. By contrast, AT(1) receptor binding in vascular smooth muscle cells was increased by 80% in patients treated with perindopril as confirmed by immunocytochemistry. eNOS was expressed primarily in endothelial cells, whereas little iNOS expression occurred in vascular smooth muscle cells of untreated patients. Both eNOS and iNOS expression seemed to increase during perindopril treatment. These results suggest that suppression of angiotensin II formation in the vascular wall and increased expression of eNOS and iNOS during ACE inhibition may be beneficial in reversing endothelial dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular disease. Because vascular AT(1) receptor expression is increased during chronic ACE inhibition, more clinical studies are required to determine whether it is necessary to combine ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists in clinical management of heart failure, coronary heart disease, and hypertension", 
    "468": "Some beneficial effects of angiotensin-I--converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II) inhibitor therapy are attributed to enhancing the activity of bradykinin on its B(2) receptor. Independent of inhibition of bradykinin hydrolysis, ACE inhibitors enhance the action of bradykinin on its B(2) receptor by inducing crosstalk between ACE and the receptor. We investigated whether inhibitors of another kininase II-type enzyme, neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase 24.11; NEP), could augment bradykinin effects unrelated to blocking its breakdown using a NEP-resistant bradykinin analog as ligand. We used transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing human B(2) receptor and NEP (CHO/NEP-B(2)) or only B(2) (CHO/B(2)) as control and human pulmonary fibroblasts (IMR90), expressing B(2), but more NEP than ACE. NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon (100 nmol/L), or omapatrilat, which inhibits both NEP and ACE, did not potentiate bradykinin in CHO/B(2) cells. In IMR90 cells, 10 nmol/L bradykinin elevated [Ca(2+)](i) and desensitized the receptor. Adding either 100 nmol/L omapatrilat or phosphoramidon resensitized the receptor to the ligand, which was abolished by receptor blocker HOE 140. Arachidonic acid release by bradykinin from CHO/NEP-B(2) cells was also augmented by 100 nmol/L phosphoramidon or omapatrilat about 3-fold, and again, the inhibitors resensitized the desensitized B(2) receptor. The inhibitors did not potentiate bradykinin when soluble rNEP was added to the medium of CHO/B(2) cells. Similar to ACE, NEP inhibitors potentiated bradykinin independent of inhibiting inactivation. Consequently, omapatrilat could augment bradykinin effects on B(2), when either ACE or NEP is expressed close to receptor on cell membrane.", 
    "469": "Bradykinin and substance P have been implicated as mediators in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-associated angioedema. Studies investigating the metabolism of bradykinin in sera from patients with a history of ACEI-associated angioedema and controls suggest that there is a defect in a non-ACE, non-kininase I pathway of bradykinin degradation, such as the aminopeptidase P (APP)/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) pathway. This study tested the hypothesis that serum APP or DPPIV activity is decreased in patients with ACEI-associated angioedema. APP and DPPIV activity were measured in sera collected from patients during ACEI-associated angioedema, from patients with a remote history of ACEI-associated angioedema, and from normotensive and untreated hypertensive controls. The effects of acute and chronic ACEI and corticosteroid treatment on serum DPPIV activity were also assessed. DPPIV activity was similar in normotensive volunteers (37.8 +/- 6.3 nmol/mL per min), in untreated hypertensive subjects who had been exposed previously to ACEI without angioedema (36.2 +/- 4.3 nmol/mL per min), in hypertensive patients with a remote history of angioedema (35.1 +/-8.5 nmol/mL per min), and in chronically ACEI-treated hypertensive subjects (36.1 +/- 5.6 nmol/mL per min). DPPIV activity decreased with increasing age (R(2)=0.10, P=0.016). Subject group significantly affected DPPIV activity (F=6.208, P=0.016) such that DPPIV activity was significantly lower in patients with ACEI-associated angioedema (26.9 +/- 4.1 nmol/mL per min) than in normotensive controls, in previously ACEI-exposed untreated hypertensive volunteers, or in ACEI-treated hypertensive volunteers, even after controlling for age. There was no effect of acute ACE inhibition or corticosteroids on DPPIV activity. With respect to APP activity, there was no difference between groups. These results suggest that DPPIV activity is depressed in individuals with hypertension during acute ACEI-associated angioedema.", 
    "470": "The beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (AT(1)-ant) are reportedly mediated by NO in heart failure (HF). We hypothesized that in the absence of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), (1) left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and myocardial remodeling would be more severe after myocardial infarction (MI), and (2) the cardioprotective effect of ACEi and AT(1)-ant would be diminished or absent in mice with HF after MI. eNOS knockout mice (eNOS-/-) and wild-type C57BL/6J (C57) mice (+/+) were subjected to MI by ligating the left coronary artery. One month after MI, each strain was treated with vehicle, ACEi (enalapril, 20 mg/kg per day), or AT(1)-ant (valsartan, 50 mg/kg per day) for 5 months. Echocardiography was performed, and systolic blood pressure was measured before MI and monthly thereafter. Interstitial collagen fraction and myocyte cross-sectional area were examined histologically. We found that (1) compared with C57 mice, eNOS-/- mice that underwent sham surgery had significantly increased systolic blood pressure (P<0.05) and increased LV mass both initially and at 1 to 3 months, although cardiac function and histological findings did not differ between strains; (2) the development of HF and myocardial remodeling were similar after MI in both strains; and (3) ACEi improved cardiac function and remodeling in C57 mice, as evidenced by increased LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV shortening fraction (LVSF) and decreased diastolic LV dimension, mass, myocyte cross-sectional area, and interstitial collagen fraction, but these benefits were absent or diminished in eNOS-/- mice (for C57 versus eNOS-/-: increase in LVEF after ACEi, 14.2 +/- 2% versus -4.9 +/- 2.5%, respectively [P<0.001]; increase in LVSF, 8.6 +/- 2.1% versus -7.2 +/- 2.8%, respectively [P<0.01]; and decrease in LV mass, -16.6 +/- 15 versus 73 +/- 23 mm(3), respectively [P<0.01]). AT(1)-ant had benefits similar to those of ACEi, which were also absent or diminished in eNOS-/- mice (for C57 versus eNOS-/-: increase in LVEF after AT(1)-ant, 13.5 +/- 1.8% versus -9.8 +/- 3%, respectively [P<0.001]; increase in LVSF, 6.1 +/- 1.6% versus -3.8 +/- 3.1%, respectively [P<0.01]). Our data suggest that the absence of NO does not alter the development of HF after MI; however, it significantly decreases the cardioprotective effects of ACEi or AT(1)-ant.", 
    "471": "Foam cell formation, the hallmark of early atherosclerosis, results from cholesterol accumulation in arterial macrophages. Angiotensin-II stimulates foam cell formation and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce atherosclerosis in animal models. The goal of the present study was to determine the effect of the ACE inhibitor Ramipril on the progression of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein-E-deficient (E0) mice with already advanced atherosclerosis. Therefore, 4-month-old atherosclerotic E0 mice were treated with Ramipril for 2 and 4 months and compared to age-matched placebo-treated mice, as well as to control young (4-month-old) non-treated E0 mice, for their atherosclerosis. Histomorphometry showed that Ramipril treatment substantially inhibited atherogenesis as shown by 48 and 72% reduction in lesion size at 6 and 8 months of age, respectively, compared to the lesion size in age-matched placebo-treated mice. Moreover, the size of the atherosclerotic lesions in 6- and 8-month-old Ramipril-treated mice was almost identical to the size of atherosclerosis of the 4-month-old control mice. Moreover, Ramipril treatment of E0 mice, significantly reduced oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) uptake by their peritoneal macrophages (MPM) by 32%, compared to Ox-LDL uptake by MPM from 6-month-old placebo mice, and even reduced it by 12% in comparison to Ox-LDL uptake by MPM from 4-month-old control mice. A significant decrease in the mRNA levels of the Ox-LDL receptor CD36 by 58% was observed in macrophages from 6-month-old Ramipril-treated mice compared to macrophages from the 6-month-old placebo-treated mice. There was even a significant reduction (by 32%) in CD36 mRNA levels in macrophages from the 6-month-old Ramipril-treated mice, compared to the CD36 mRNA levels in macrophages from the 4-month-old control mice. We thus conclude that administration of the ACE inhibitor Ramipril to E0 mice, which already exhibit significant atherosclerosis, blocked the progression of the atherosclerotic lesion build-up, a phenomenon that could be related to Ramipril-induced inhibition of Ox-LDL uptake by macrophages.",

    "474": "As monotherapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (37.9%) and beta-blockers (38.3%) were the most commonly prescribed classes of antihypertensives by FPs and GPs, respectively. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were ranked third by both categories of physicians. For two-drug combinations, a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor was the combination of choice for both physician categories. Patients managed by the FPs were more likely to receive a beta-blocker-CCB combination (17.4 vs. 14.9%) or a diuretic-ACE inhibitor combination (16.7 vs. 11.4%) and less likely to receive a beta-blocker-diuretic combination (11.8 vs. 16.7%) than those managed by the GPs. The proportion of patients receiving antihypertensive combinations was 40.6 and 38.5% for FPs and GPs, respectively. While the GPs prescribed CCB as a monotherapy to the elderly most often, the FPs choice was a beta-blocker. Diuretics were less preferred by both FPs and GPs. Beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor was again the most preferred combination of both FPs and GPs. FPs prescribed CCB-beta-blocker combinations more often than GPs (P = 0.01), whereas CCB-ACE inhibitor combinations were less preferred (P = 0.09). A trend towards excessive use of short-acting nifedipine as monotherapy for elderly patients, both by FPs and by GPs, was noticed. Glibenclamide, alone or in combination with metformin, was the foremost antidiabetic drug prescribed by FPs and GPs. Middle-aged (45-64 years) patients seen by GPs were more likely to receive glibenclamide than those treated by FPs (P = 0.001) and less likely to receive gliclazide (P = 0.01). Combinations of a beta-blocker with either glibenclamide or insulin were prescribed considerably more often by GPs.", 
    "475": "Within the same practice setting, a substantial difference was observed between FPs and GPs in terms of preference for different classes of drugs in the management of diabetic hypertension.

It is shown that the baseline indices for a long-term AP monitoring (1-3 days) determine the choice of individualized differentiated therapy consisting of a combination of two (atenolol and enalapril maleate) or three (atenolol, enalapril maleate, hydrochlorothiazide) hypotensive drug preparations. Individual schemes of the above drug therapy permitted not only the correction of identified disturbances in the 24-hour AP profile but also contributed to the improvement of hemodynamic maintenance of graded physical loads, favouring positive changes in the structural-and-functional status of the myocardium, which facts suggest indirectly an improvement of prognosis in EH patients.",

The study was multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy and active-controlled in design, with patients randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive telmisartanor enalapril. After a two-week placebo run-in period, the 71 eligible patients received either telmisartan, 40 mg, orenalapril, 10 mg, once-daily for four weeks. Thereafter, doses were titrated to telmisartan 80 mg or enalapril 20 mg once-daily if supine trough DBP was still > or =90 mmHg. After a further four weeks, dose titration was again performed, as required, to telmisartan, 80 mg,or enalapril, 20 mg, or frusemide was given in addition if the double dose was already being administered. Mean Ccr decreases of 4.6% for telmisartan and 2.8% forenalapril were not clinically significant. Adverse events occurred in 12 (26.7%) telmisartan-treated patients and in 12 (46.2%) patients receiving enalapril. The mean reduction in supine trough DBP from baseline to the last available value was 12.5 mmHg for telmisartan,compared with 11.9 mmHg for enalapril. A full (reduction of >or=10 mmHg) or partial (reduction of 7-9 mmHg) response occurred in 78% of telmisartanpatients and 65% of enalapril patients. In the enalapril group, 43% of patients required frusemide, compared with 29% of those in the telmisartan group. In conclusion, telmisartan lacks detrimental effect on renal function, is effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension in patients with moderate renal failure,and is comparable to enalapril.",

Ninety percent of the patients had higher serum concentrations of enalaprilat than has been reported in subjects with normal kidney function, and a marked elevation of serum enalaprilat was observed in patients with GFR <30 ml/minute. All but three patients had serum ACE activity below the reference range. The ACE genotype did not influence the results. Additional pharmacokinetic studies were done in nine patients in whom GFR was 23 (10-42)ml/minute/1.73 m2.

Urinary cGMP excretion was significantly increased in L-158,809-treated rats compared with the non-treated group, suggesting that the dysfunctional NO system may be activated by the treatment. AT1-receptor binding in the kidney was inhibited to about 40% of the control value after administration of L- 158,809. The AT2-receptor binding was inhibited to less than 15% of the control value.

The stimulatory effect of AT1-receptor antagonism on cGMP production was not mediated by AT2-receptor-dependent mechanisms, since renalAT2-receptor binding density was suppressed following treatment with L-158,809.

The role of AT2-receptors in the regulation of the cerebral circulation is uncertain. Hence, the present study investigated the effect on CBF autoregulation of blocking of angiotensin AT2-receptors with PD 123319 in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Anaesthetised and ventilated SHR were given PD 123319, 0.36 mg/kg/min, intravenously, and compared with a control group. CBF was measured by the intracarotid 133xenon injection method and BP was raised by noradrenaline infusion and lowered by controlled haemorrhage in separate groups of rats. The limits of autoregulation were determined by computed least-sum-of-squares analysis. PD 123319 did not influence baseline CBF, but resulted in a minor BP decrease (10 control and 10 treated rats). The lower limit of CBF autoregulation (eight treated and eight control) as well as the upper limit of CBF autoregulation (eight treated and eight control) were not significantly different in PD 123319 and control animals (lower limit treated 102+/-4 mmHg and control 94+/-4; NS, and upper limit treated 171 +/- 10 mmHg and control 162+/-7; NS).

Four treatments were studied: vehicle (0.5% Natrosol), telmisartan 3 mg/kg, HCTZ 10 mg/kg, and telmisartan 3 mg/kg+HCTZ 10 mg/kg. The effects on BP and heart rate were studied in 40 SHRs (10 animals per group) using an implanted telemetry device. Renal excretory function was assessed in 76 SHRs (18 animals per group, of which nine were used for urine sampling and nine for blood sampling). The telmisartan/HCTZ combination produced the greatest reductions in trough DBP (-44+/-1.5 mmHg), SBP (-60+/-1.9 mmHg) and mean BP (mBP; -53+/-1.7 mmHg) after five days of therapy (p<0.05 vs. vehicle and vs. telmisartan). Telmisartan monotherapy also decreased DBP, SBP and mBP significantly (p<0.05), but only minor BP fluctuations occurred in SHRs receiving HCTZ or vehicle. Telmisartan/HCTZ elevated heart rate by approximately 12 beats per minute (p<0.05 vs.control). Significant increases in urine volume and Na+, Cl, K+, creatinine and glucose excretion were observed with HCTZ treatment (p<0.01). Telmisartan/HCTZ also promoted renal water and electrolyte excretion (p<0.01); the diuretic effect appeared to be greater with the combination than with HCTZ alone, and there was some attenuation of urinary K+ loss. Elevated blood urea nitrogen levels were observed only in HCTZ-treated SHRs. These results indicate that the antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan in SHRs is augmented by co-administration with HCTZ. The combination did not affect renal excretory function, with the exception of an increase in blood urea nitrogen and a possible amelioration of HCTZ-related K+ depletion.", 
    "489": "The possible contributions of the angiotensin receptor subtypes 1 (AT1) and 2 (AT2) to angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced changes in collagen secretion and production were studied using the specific angiotensin AT1- and AT2-receptor antagonists telmisartan and P-186, respectively. Cardiac fibroblasts (from normal male adult rats) from passage 2 were cultured to confluency and incubated in the presence of 10(-10) to 10(-6) M Ang II in serum-free Dulbecco's MEM medium for 24 hours. Collagen production and secretion were assayed by'H-Proline incorporation; non-collagen production and secretion were also calculated. Ang II dose-dependently increased collagen secretion and production in rat adult cardiac fibroblasts in culture. Non-collagen secretion and production were also concentration-dependently increased by Ang II. Addition of 100 nmol/l Ang II increased (p<0.01) collagen secretion and production bv 75+/-6 (SEM)% and 113+/-23%, respectively, and non-collagen secretion and production by 65+/-6% and 57+/-16%, respectively. Pretreatment of cardiac fibroblasts with telmisartan completely blocked the Ang II-induced increase in collagen secretion (p<0.001) and production(p<0.05) and in non-collagen secretion (p<0.01) and production (p<0.01). P-186 had no effect on the Ang II-induced increase in collagen secretion and production. Addition of telmisartan and P-186 did not affect collagen secretion and production in basal cardiac fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that the effects of Ang II on collagen secretion and production in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts in culture are AT1-receptor mediated, since they were abolished by the specific AT1-receptor antagonist, telmisartan, but not by the specific AT2-receptor antagonist, P-186.", 
    "490": "The goal of this study was to assess the effect of acute or chronic treatment with S5590, a combination of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (0.76 mg/kg/day) and the diuretic indapamide (0.24 mg/kg/day) on renal function in spontaneously hypertensive rats with moderate renal injury. Renal function was evaluated in conscious rats by clearance methods using labelled inulin and PAH, after catheterisation of the carotid artery, jugular vein and bladder. Both acute and chronic treatment normalised renal vascular resistance, although the effect on blood pressure was more marked after chronic than after acute treatment. Although acute treatment with S5590 increased glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, chronic treatment did not affect these parameters. Diuresis and natriuresis were only slightly modified and the results suggest a marked renal vasodilatation. In conclusion, the maintenance of renal function after chronic treatment, in a setting of normalisation of arterial pressure, suggest that such a combined treatment may exert marked renal functional protective effects in hypertension.", 
    "491": "Previous studies have shown that angiotensin II (Ang II), by mediating rapid recruitment of collateral circulation, has a protective effect in the setting of acute ischaemia. In an experimental model of acute cerebral ischaemia in the gerbil, Fernandez et al. have reported that the mechanism of the protective effect of Ang 11 is blood pressure (BP)-independent, and that the AT1-receptor antagonist, losartan, but not the ACE inhibitor (ACE-I),enalapril, decreases mortality following unilateral carotid artery ligation. The aim of this study was to examine there producibility of the respective effects of losartan and enalapril, and to verify that these differential effects are drug class-related. Acute cerebral ischaemia was induced in anaesthetised gerbils bv unilateral carotid ligation. The effect of pretreatment with two different ACE-I(enalapril and lisinopril), and two different AT1-receptor antagonists (losartan and candesartan), administered orally or intravenously, on mortality were compared. Kaplan-Meier survival curves at day three were analysed bv a log-rank test. Pretreatment with both enalapril and lisinopril significantly decreased survival at day three compared with controls, while the AT1-receptor antagonists losartan and candesartan, despite similarly lowering BP, did not increase mortality. Coadministration of losartan and enalapril increased mortality to the same extent as enalapril alone. This study confirms that Ang II contributes to protective mechanisms against acute cerebral ischaemia through non AT1-receptor-mediated, BP-independent effects.", 
    "492": "The blood-pressure-lowering efficacy of both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) has been clearly demonstrated in recent years, although there is evidence that within the ARB class the individual therapies not necessarily identical in terms of sustained and consistent antihypertensive efficacy over the entire closing period. However, the results of the recent HOPE study have demonstrated that ACE-I have a wider role to play in treating cardiovascular disease, and support the idea that ACE inhibition specifically has a vascular protective effect. the most dramatic benefits were seen in patients with systolic blood pressures in the hypertensive range. The ability of the ACE-I to provide protective effects beyond blood pressure control may be due to their ability to attenuate the breakdown of kinins as well as a role in reducing angiotensin II. These data post the question as to whether the pharmacological properties of the ARBs, in addition to their antihypertensive efficacy, may also play a significant role in influencing cardiovascular outcomes. A number of prospective long-term studies, including VALUE, SCOPE, LIFE, VALIANT, OPTIMAAL, VAL-HEFT and CHARM I-III, are investigating the effects of the ARBs or mortality and morbidity in patients with cardiovascular disease. These studies should answer important questions with respect to the role that ARBs may have in influencing cardiovascular outcomes, although it remains to be seen whether ARBs can match the protective effects of ramipril in high-risk patients. Given the excellent tolerability of the ARBs, it will be of value to examine the influence of ARBs on cardiovascular outcomes in all relevant patient groups.", 
    "493": "Arterial wall stiffness is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in hypertensive patients, which is further exacerbated by co-existent diabetes mellitus. Increased arterial stiffness is directly associated with an increase in pulse wave velocity (PWV) and indirectly with increased central and peripheral blood pressure. Following a two-week placebo run-in period, 27 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, were randomised to once daily treatment with either telmisartan 40 mg or placebo for three weeks, and after a two-week washout period, crossed-over to the alternative treatment for a further three weeks. Carotid/femoral and carotid/radial PWV were measured non-invasively using the automatic Complior device, and central parameters (central blood pressure, pulse contour analysis, and augmentation index) were measured using the SphygmoCor system, at the start and end of each treatment period. Compared with placebo, treatment with telmisartan significantly reduced carotid/femoral PWV (mean adjusted treatment difference -0.95 m/s, 95% confidence intervals: -1.67, -0.23 m/s, p=0.013), as well as peripheral and central diastolic, systolic and pulse pressure. In conclusion, the results of the this study show that telmisartan is effective in reducing arterial stiffness in hypertensive patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and may potentially have beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes, beyond blood-pressure lowering effects in the patient group.", 
    "494": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), the effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), exerts a variety of actions in physiological blood pressure and body fluid regulation, and is implicated as a major pathogenic factor in the development of cardiovascular disease. Inhibition of the RAS, via treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), or more recently the Ang II AT(1)-receptor blockers (ARBs), has been used as a therapeutic approach to the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular dysfunction. Evidence from animal and clinical studies shows that the antihypertensive and overall organ-protective actions of the ARBs are similar to those of ACE-I. However, as the ARBs selectively block the AT(1)-receptor, which is responsible for the known cardiovascular actions of Ang II, leave the AT(2)-receptor unopposed and do not interfere with the breakdown of bradykinin, there is the potential for the beneficial effects in hypertensive patients with cardiovascular diseases such as left ventricular hypertrophy. Furthermore, there may be additional benefits when the ARBs are combined with ACE-I in such patients. Animal studies contribute to the elucidation and understanding of the role of AT(1)- and AT(2)-receptors in the cardiovascular system, and may help in the design of clinical studies aimed at investigating the effects of ACE-I, ARBs, and their combination, on cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients.", 
    "495": "Aortic elastin turnover is significantly accelerated in atherosclerosis, partly because of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system caused by hypercholesterolaemia. We postulated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) prevent the aortic elastin loss in experimental hypercholesterolaemia. Two doses of ACE-I (captopril, enalapril and quinapril) were used: a dose equivalent to that applied to human subjects and a dose 10 times higher. We found that the increase in serum and aortic elastolytic activity in cholesterol-fed rabbits was prevented by high-dose captopril. The elastin content in aorta homogenates from cholesterol-fed rabbits was significantly decreased. The higher dose of captopril, but no other ACE-I, prevented this decrease in aortic elastin content. In cholesterol-fed rabbits the elastin-bound calcium content was significantly elevated. The higher doses of captopril and enalapril lowered the elastin-bound calcium content. In serum and aortic homogenates of cholesterol-fed rabbits, ACE activity was elevated by 15% and 77%, respectively. Both doses of captopril, enalapril and quinapril prevented this cholesterol-induced increase in serum and aortic ACE activity. We conclude that: 1) administration of captopril at doses 10 times higher than those used in humans prevents hypercholesterolaemia increased aortic elastin loss. 2) higher doses of captopril and enalapril prevent the hypercholesterolaemia-induced increase in aortic elastin-bound calcium.", 
    "496": "This study compared the cardiovascular and renal effects of long-term telmisartan (3 and 10 mg/kg/day)and lisinopril (10 mg/kg/day) in an animal model combining hypertension and diabetes mellitus. It was a parallel-group study of diabetic, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), treated with control or active treatment for eight months. A non-diabetic SHR control group was run in parallel. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (45 mg/kg i.v.) in SHRs aged 9-10 weeks. Animals were treated with telmisartan (3 or 10mg/kg/day), lisinopril (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Plasma glucose levels, blood pressure (BP), and urinary protein and albumin excretion were measured monthly. Telmisartan treatment significantly reduced BP of diabetic SHRs in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05, low-dose, n= 18; p<0.01, high-dose, n=15). The BP reduction in the lisinopril group was similar to that in the telmisartan 10 mg/kg/day group. Compared with non-diabetic SHRs, untreated diabetic SHRs developed severe proteinuria and albuminuria over the experimental period (p<0.01). In diabetic SHRs, proteinuria and albuminuria were dose-dependently and significantly attenuated by treatment with telmisartan (p<0.01 with the higher dose) and lisinopril (p<0.01). Compared with the untreated diabetic SHRs, cardiac hypertrophy was significantly reduced after treatment with both doses of telmisartan and with lisinopril. Telmisartan, 10 mg/kg/day, but not lisinopril, significantly attenuated the diabetes-induced increase in glomerular volume. In conclusion, telmisartan, 10 mg/kg/day, is at least as beneficial as lisinopril, 10 mg/kg/day, in lowering BP, reducing cardiac hypertrophy and attenuating renal excretion of protein and albumin in this model.", 
    "497": "Marked heterogeneity characterises blood pressure (BP)responses to antihypertensive drugs. The efficacy of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system(RAAS) is predicted (albeit weakly) by plasma renin activity (PRA) and it has been assumed that, within individuals, there would be concordance in efficacy between drugs acting at different sites to block the RAAS.", 
    "498": "The present study was a randomised, double-blind,two-way, crossover study designed to evaluate intra-individual BP responses to an angiotensin II AT -receptor blocker (ARB), candesartan cilexetil, and anangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), lisinopril, and to identify potential phenotypic characteristics of patients' responses to the drugs.", 
    "499": "92 patients with essential hypertension, (mean systolic/diastolic BP 160/101 mmHg) entered the trial,of whom 76 patients completed both treatments.", 
    "500": "There was marked heterogeneity in response to the two drugs. 50% of patients responded (fall in diastolic BP of>10 mmHg or achieved diastolic pressure <90 mmHg)to both drugs; 16% were non-responders to both drugs; 20% responded to the ACE-I but not the ARB and 15% responded to the ARB but not to the ACE-I. Individual responses to the two drugs were poorly correlated (for diastolic pressure: r=0.19, p=0.11; for systolic pressure: r=-0.01, p=0.92). For the ACE-I, the fall in both systolic and diastolic BP was related to pre-treatment PRA (for diastolic pressure: r=0.31, p=0.008; for systolic pressure: r=0.24, p=0.04). In the case of the ARB, no relationship between the fall in BP and PRA was observed. These observations suggest that more complex mechanisms may be involved in BP reduction with ARBs than with ACE-I.", 
    "501": "The effects of the specific angiotensin II (Ang II) AT1-receptor blocker valsartan on events related to restenosis were investigated in rabbits after common carotid balloon injury. Six animals were given valsartan from two days prior to injury until 14 days post-injury. Three control groups (n=6 in each group) were either sham-operated, untreated or treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor,captopril. Both ACE inhibition and AT,-receptor blockade had marked effects on plasma levels of endothelin ET1, thromboxane TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1-alpha. The most dramatic effects on ET, levels were seen in rabbits treated with valsartan, where levels were reduced to values close to those for sham-operated animals (96.85 vs. 86.45 pg/ml). Captopril treatment led to a statistically significant (p<0.01) reduction in ET1 levels compared with untreated animals, but the reduction was only about half that seen with AT1-receptor blockade. TXB2 levels doubled (202.58 vs.413.28 pg/ml) upon arterial injury in control animals but rose by only 20-35% in rabbits treated with captopril (246.45 pg/ml) or valsartan (268.13). In untreated animals, 6-keto-PGF1-alpha levels decreased slightly after injury, but for both the captopril and valsartan groups, there were significant increases in levels of this prostaglandin derivative, effects attributed to the action of bradykinins. Levels were highest in the captopril-treated animals. Valsartan and captopril treatment led to a significant reduction in neointimal thickness and the extent of lumen stenosis compared with untreated animals. Both treatments were effective in reducing neointimal area and significantly (p<0.05)reduced cell proliferation. The differences between treatments can be attributed to the different actions of the agents, as valsartan leaves the AT2-receptor unblocked, while captopril, through inhibition of Ang II synthesis, prevents stimulation of both receptors.A combination of both treatments may be a possible way forward in the clinical prevention of restenosis.", 
    "502": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a crucial role in the generation of angiotensin II (Ang II) via conversion from angiotensin I (Ang I). There has been substantial recent interest in non-ACE pathways of Ang II generation in the heart, large arteries, and the kidney. In the case of the human kidney, studied when in balance on a low-salt diet, the renal haemodynamic response to Ang II antagonists substantially exceeds the renal response to ACE inhibitors (ACE-I), suggesting that about 30-40% of Ang II-generation occurs via non-ACE pathways. In this study, we examined the relative contribution of non-ACE pathways, by comparing the response to candesartan and to captopril at the top of the dose-response in normal humans when in balance on a low-salt, as well as a high-salt, diet. As anticipated on a low-salt diet, the increase in renal plasma flow (RPF) in response to candesartan (165+/-14 mL/min/1.73 m2) significantly exceeded the response to captopril (118+/-12 mL/min/1.73 m2; p<0.01). In subjects studied on a high-salt diet, the response to candesartan (97+/-20 mL/min/1.73 m2) also significantly exceeded the response to captopril on the same diet(30+/-15 mL/min/1.73 m2; p<0.01). This remarkable response to candesartan in subjects on a high-salt diet,when compared with the response to captopril,suggests that non-ACE-dependent Ang II generation was influenced less than the classical renal pathway with an increase in salt intake, so that the percentage of Ang II generated via the non-ACE pathway rose to the 60-70% range.", 
    "503": "Activation of the RAAS has been linked with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke,(1,2,37,38) and recently these beneficial effects have, in part, been attributed to the effects of the RAAS on the fibrinolytic system. Indeed, ACE seems to occupy a central position in modulating the fibrinolytic balance, where an angiotensin II-mediated increase of PAI-1 plays a major role. By contrast, the effect on bradykinin stimulated t-PA release may be of lesser importance, although the data are conflicting. Importantly, the impact of the RAAS on the fibrinolytic balance may also contribute to the favourable effects of ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor antagonists on cardiovascular events, particularly when considering the activation of the RAAS in hypertension and heart failure. More work is clearly required in this area to elucidate potential therapeutic targets.", 
    "504": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II; ACE) inhibitors are important therapeutic agents widely used for treatment in cardiovascular and renal diseases. They inhibit angiotensin II release and bradykinin inactivation; these actions do not explain completely the clinical benefits. We found that enalaprilat and other ACE inhibitors in nanomolar concentrations activate human bradykinin B(1) receptors directly in the absence of ACE and the B(1) agonist des-Arg(10)-Lys(1)-bradykinin. These inhibitors activate at the Zn(2+)-binding consensus sequence HEXXH (195-199) in B(1), which is present also in ACE but not in the B(2) receptor. Activation elevates [Ca(2+)](i) and releases NO from endothelial or transfected cells expressing the B(1) receptor but is blocked by Ca-EDTA, a B(1) receptor antagonist, the synthetic undecapeptide sequence (192-202) of B(1), and the mutagenesis of His(195) to Ala(195). Except for the B(1) antagonist, these agents and manipulations did not block activation by a peptide ligand. Thus, Zn(2+) is essential for B(1) receptor activation by ACE inhibitors at the zinc-binding consensus sequence. Ischemia or cytokines induce abundant B(1) receptor expression. B(1) receptor activation by ACE inhibitors, a novel mode of action reported here first, can contribute to their therapeutic effects by releasing NO in the heart and to some side effects.", 
    "505": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure. A diagnostic assay to measure angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was transformed into an enzyme inhibition assay and optimised, which led to a more sensitive and less expensive assay. By this spectrophotometric method, ACE inhibition is measured using the substrate furanacryloyl-Phe-Gly-Gly and as ACE source rabbit lung acetone extract. The optimised as well as the original ACE inhibition assay were used to verify the ACE inhibitory activity of captopril. The ACE inhibition assay was further validated by enalapril, its active derivative enalaprilat and the ACE-inhibitory peptide Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg, corresponding to a tryptic fragment of bovine beta-lactoglobulin. Sigmoid curves could be fit adequately to the data points representing ACE inhibition in function of inhibitor concentration. IC(50) values for these compounds corresponded well with literature data. Furthermore, pea and whey protein hydrolysates obtained by digestion with trypsin showed ACE inhibitory activity in the ACE inhibition assay. Hence, this optimised assay is suitable to screen for ACE inhibitory peptides derived from food proteins with a possible antihypertensive effect in vivo.",

The effects of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to eight different epitopes on the N-terminal domain of ACE on shedding was investigated using Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells) expressing an ACE transgene and using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Antibody-induced shedding of ACE was strongly epitope-specific: most of the antibodies increased the shedding by 20-40%, mAbs 9B9 and 3A5 increased the shedding by 270 and 410% respectively, whereas binding of mAb 3G8 decreased ACE shedding by 36%. The ACE released following mAb treatment lacked a hydrophobic transmembrane domain anchor. The antibody-induced shedding was completely inhibited at 4 degrees C and by zinc chelation using 1,10-phenanthroline, suggesting involvement of a metalloprotease in this process. A hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitor (batimastat, BB-94) was 15 times more efficacious in inhibiting mAb-induced ACE shedding than basal (constitutive) ACE release. Treatment of CHO-ACE cells with BB-94 more effectively prevented elevation in antibody-dependent (but not basal) ACE release induced by 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and iodoacetamide. These data suggest that different secretases might be responsible for ACE release under basal compared with antibody-induced shedding. Further experiments with more than 40 protease inhibitors suggest that calpains, furin and the proteasome may participate in this process.",

At pH 3.0, none of the peptides interacted with beta-LG at any temperature, buffer molarity, or beta-LG/peptide ratio probably due to electrostatic repulsions between the highly protonated species. At pH 6.8 and 8.0, charged peptides beta-LG 130-135, 69-83, and 146-149 bound to beta-LG under some physicochemical conditions, possibly by nonspecific binding. However, both hydrophobic peptides probably bind to the inner cavity (beta-barrel) of beta-LG, provoking the release of materials absorbing at 214 nm. Given the known biological activities of the hydrophobic peptides used in this study (opioid and ACE-inhibitory activities), their binding to beta-LG may be relevant to a better understanding of the physiological function of the protein.",

However, their effects in transplant recipients without PTE are not certain, and the mechanism by which they reduce Hb levels in patients with PTE remains unclear. This study evaluated the effects of losartan and enalapril on Hb levels in relation to serum erythropoietin (EPO) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in 8 patients with PTE and 10 patients without PTE. All 18 patients were treated sequentially with 24 weeks of losartan therapy, followed by 24 weeks of enalapril therapy; the two treatment phases were separated by a washout period. Patients with PTE showed significantly greater baseline Hb and IGF-1 concentrations compared with patients without PTE before both losartan and enalapril treatments. Baseline serum EPO levels were similar for patients with and without PTE. Baseline Hb level correlated significantly with IGF-1 level (r = 0.517; P = 0.002), but not with EPO level. Treatment with enalapril, 5 mg, reduced Hb levels more markedly than treatment with losartan, 50 mg, in patients with PTE. In patients without PTE, enalapril, 5 mg, mildly reduced Hb levels, whereas losartan, 50 mg, had no significant Hb-lowering effect. The reduction in Hb levels with enalapril therapy in patients with PTE was associated with a significant reduction in circulating IGF-1 levels, but not EPO levels, whereas losartan reduced Hb levels with no significant change in circulating IGF-1 and EPO levels. In patients without PTE, no significant change was noted in serum EPO and IGF-1 levels with either treatment. The differential Hb-lowering effect with losartan and enalapril treatment in patients with and without PTE suggests that the pathogenesis for PTE is complex and heterogeneous. Different erythropoietic mechanisms may be involved in patients with and without PTE. Further large-scale study is needed to determine the exact interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and regulation of IGF-1 and EPO synthesis and define the exact mechanism by which losartan and enalapril reduce Hb levels.", 
    "521": "Progression of renal failure, despite renoprotection with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with proteinuric nephropathies, may be caused by persistent renal production of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) through the angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptors. We tested the hypothesis that AT1-receptor blocker therapy added to a background of chronic maximal ACE inhibitor therapy will result in a reduction in urinary TGF-beta1 levels in such patients. Sixteen patients completed a two-period, crossover, randomized, controlled trial, details of which have been previously reported. All patients were administered lisinopril, 40 mg/d, with either losartan, 50 mg/d, or placebo. Blood pressure (BP) was measured using a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor. Overnight specimens of urine were analyzed for urine TGF-beta1, protein, and creatinine concentrations. Mean age of the study population was 53 +/- 9 (SD) years; body mass index, 38 +/- 5.7 kg/m2; seated BP, 156 +/- 18/88 +/- 12 mm Hg; and urine protein excretion, 3.6 +/- 0.71 g/g of creatinine. Twelve patients had diabetic nephropathy, and the remainder had chronic glomerulonephritis. At baseline, urinary TGF-beta1 levels were significantly increased in the study population compared with healthy controls (13.2 +/- 1.2 versus 1.7 +/- 1.1 ng/g creatinine; P < 0.001). There was a strong correlation between baseline urine protein excretion and urinary TGF-beta1 level (r2 = 0.53; P = 0.001), as well as systolic BP and urinary TGF-beta1 level (r2 = 0.57; P < 0.001). After 4 weeks of add-on losartan therapy, there was a 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16% to 55%) decline in urinary TGF-beta1 levels (13.3 [95% CI, 11.4 to 15.5] to 8.2 pg/mg creatinine [95% CI, 6.2 to 10.7]). The reduction in urinary TGF-beta1 levels occurred independent of changes in mean urinary protein excretion or BP. Thus, proteinuric patients with renal failure, despite maximal ACE inhibition, had increased urinary levels of TGF-beta1 that improved over 1 month of add-on therapy with losartan. We speculate that dual blockade with losartan and an ACE inhibitor may provide additional renoprotection by decreasing renal production of TGF-beta1.", 
    "522": "It remains unclear whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a proarteriosclerotic or an antiarteriosclerotic factor. We recently reported that long-term inhibition of nitric oxide by administering Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) induces coronary vascular inflammation and arteriosclerosis.", 
    "523": "We used this animal model to investigate the role of VEGF in arteriosclerosis. We blocked VEGF activity in vivo by transfecting with plasmid DNA encoding the murine soluble FLT-1 (sFLT-1) gene into thigh muscle. Soluble FLT-1 can suppress VEGF activity both by sequestering VEGF and by functioning as a dominant-negative inhibitor of VEGF receptors. We observed vascular inflammation associated with increased VEGF expression within 3 days of L-NAME administration, which was prevented by pretreatment with ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor antagonist, or neutralizing monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 antibody. The sFLT-1 gene transfer attenuated the early vascular inflammation and prevented late arteriosclerosis. The sFLT-1 gene transfer also inhibited increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and transforming growth factor-beta, indicating creation of a positive feedback loop to cause arteriosclerosis.",

The separation of the preparations was performed using methanol. In the densitometric method the determination of captopril was done at lambda = 212 nm, while for enalapril at lambda = 210 nm. In the gas chromatographic method a DB-17 capillary column was used as well as a flame ionization detector. Perindopril was used as the internal standard.",

A reversible perfusion abnormality was identified by (201)thallium in the inferior segment of the left ventricle. (123)iodine meta-iodo-benzyl-guanigine uptake showed extremely diminished uptake in the inferior segment of the myocardium. (123)iodine labelled beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid myocardial single photon emission computed tomography showed decreased uptake of the inferior segment in the early image, whereas the delayed images revealed significant fill-in of the tracer in the inferior segment of the myocardium. These findings suggest that coronary microvascular dysfunction causes regional myocardial ischemia, resulting in metabolic and sympathetic abnormality.", 
    "527": "Omapatrilat was designed to inhibit simultaneously angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The ubiquitous involvement of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, originally conceived as an axis of sodium and fluid metabolism in inflammation, thrombosis and cardiac and smooth muscle hypertrophy, is a major factor in disease progression for conditions as diverse as hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease and diabetes. Interruption of angiotensin II generation and bradykinin degradation by ACE inhibition is a major therapeutic advance in the management of these diseases. NEP metabolizes both bradykinin and the natriuretic peptides (atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, c-type natriuretic peptide and adrenomedullin). These peptides counter the adverse effects of angiotensin II by their vasodilator, natriuretic, diuretic and autonomic neural actions; by their antitrophic effects; and by suppressing plasma renin activity. These two systems can be considered key components of a cardiorenal axis that maintains blood pressure and cardiopulmonary blood volume within a stable range. This balance is compromised in the setting of heart failure and primary hypertension. The combination of ACE and NEP inhibition should augment the beneficial hemodynamic and tissue effects of bradykinin and the natriuretic peptides. Vasopeptidase inhibition, therefore, is a novel approach to cardiovascular therapy, with implications for hypertension, heart failure, renal function and ischemic heart disease.",

The patients comprised those who were admitted to the participating hospitals with a diagnosis of CHF during the study period. Active dissemination included stakeholder development of pocket cards outlining an algorithm for the management of CHF based on the CCS guidelines and was conducted at the two Edmonton, Alberta hospitals. The cards were widely disseminated in conjunction with a series of workshops and presentations. Passive dissemination occurred at six other hospitals, and involved only the distribution of the CCS guidelines in the usual fashion (with no structured dissemination program). The primary outcome measured was the use of ACE inhibitors in the six- to 12-month period before the release of the CCS guidelines, compared with after the release in the active and passive groups.",

A significant reduction of both pain threshold and tolerance was observed during the anti-hypertensive treatments (Friedman test: P = 0.007 and P = 0.006, respectively). Pain sensitivity was similar during the two treatments and it did not differ from pain sensitivity values of normotensive controls. ANCOVAs were computed to evaluate the relationship between anti-hypertensive agents and pain sensitivity, after controlling for blood pressure. A 24 h mean pressure served as covariate, removing any effect of blood pressure; a significant difference was observed entering both pain threshold and tolerance as dependent variables (F = 5.28, P = 0.0076; F = 8.16, P = 0.0007, respectively).", 
    "536": "Both the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the AT1 receptor blocking agent losartan acted similarly on pain threshold and tolerance, pain sensitivity being increased during the two anti-hypertensive treatments. The blood pressure reduction during drug assumption could not account for the pain sensitivity changes observed.

EDHF-mediated relaxation was similarly improved in the candesartan and enalapril groups (maximum relaxation: candesartan group, 70 +/- 7%; enalapril group, 63 +/- 8%; old group, 33 +/- 9%). Hyperpolarization and relaxation responses to levcromakalim, an ATP-sensitive K+-channel opener, were similar in all groups.",

    "545": "Patients with essential hypertension have an impaired endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in the renal arteries. The possible mechanisms by which essential hypertension is associated with alterations in endothelial function are decreased endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity, decreased availability or deficiency of L-arginine, increased endogenous NO synthase inhibitor, inactivation of NO by superoxide anions, and increased vasoconstrictors. However, the precise mechanism is not known. In addition, we are now confronted with a difficult question. And the question is whether endothelial dysfunction is a cause or consequence of hypertension. We hypothesize that the initial endothelial dysfunction raises blood pressure, and the development of hypertension impairs much more endothelial function, resulting in constituting the vicious cycle between endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. However, at the moment, it is impossible to answer this question with any certainty. Impairment of endothelial function has been shown to play a critical role in the development and maintenance of hypertension. It is clinically important to select an appropriate intervention that is effective in improving endothelial dysfunction in patients with essential hypertension. Several investigators including us have demonstrated that certain interventions improve endothelial dysfunction of forearm and renal circulation in patients with essential hypertension: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; lifestyle modification: exercise, body weight reduction, and sodium reduction; estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women; and novel properties: vitamin C and tetrahydrobiopterine. In patients with essential hypertension, endothelial function is impaired in several arteries. However, endothelial dysfunction in essential hypertension is reversible. We can restore endothelial function in essential hypertensive patients.",

    "580": "The introduction of new immunosuppressive regimens results in the significant improvement in the outcome of patients after kidney transplantation. However, about 5 percent of renal transplants are lost every year. Not only immunological (alloantigendependent) but also nonimmunological (alloantigen-independent) factors are involved in late graft loss. Among them, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, proteinuria, genetic predisposition, viral infection and nephrotoxicity of immunosuppressive drugs contribute to the development and to the progression of chronic post-transplant nephropathy. Hypertension can be both the cause and the consequence of chronic allograft failure. Hypertension is frequently observed before transplantation, persists after grafting and increases the risk of chronic allograft nephropathy. Hypercholesterolemia, obesity, atheromatosis, polycythemia, and excessive salt intake are factors contributing in post-transplant hypertension. However, in some cases, hypertension can be transferred with the grafted kidney, as observed in normotensive patients before renal transplantation. In 1 to 12 percent of cases, the cause of post transplant hypertension is the stenosis of the transplant artery. Sometimes the presence of hypertension in renal recipients may result from the recurrence of glomerulonephritis or from the development of glomerulonephritis de novo in the graft. Also immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and cyclosporine A contributes to the increased prevalence of hypertension by 20-30 percent. The development of the graft nephroarteriolosclerosis as a consequence of hypertension accelerates the progression of the post-transplant nephropathy. Adequate control of the arterial pressure (< 140/90) should be achieved in all renal transplant recipients. Reduction in protein and salt intake is important to reduce hyper-filtration and slows the progression of transplant nephropathy. However, pharmacological treatment is usually needed. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor antagonists exhibit beneficial hemodynamic effect leading to the reduction of glomerular hypertension and proteinuria. Calcium antagonists besides their systemic antihypertensive effect, can protect renal grafts from vascular and renal toxicity of CyA. Sometimes, combined therapy with these and other antihypertensive drugs and diuretics is necessary.",

In contrast, the plasma angiotension II concentration did not change with enalapril and only increased 2-fold with amlodipine. Thus, the present study indicates that losartan more effectively regresses LVH in patients with ESRD than do enalapril and amlodipine despite a comparable depressor effect between the three drugs.",

The risk for hypertension and for adverse drug reactions is highest in the elderly, who have the greatest need for pharmacologic therapy. The most important class of drug interactions involves the cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme system, which handles a variety of xenobiotic substances. A potential for interactions with these enzymes exists with calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers but not with diuretic antihypertensives, which are renally eliminated and more vulnerable to drug interactions that occur in the kidney.

    "605": "Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common disorder usually associated with silent or symptomatic arterial disease elsewhere in the circulation and a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors inducing atheroma progression and/or thrombotic complications. Because of these strong clinical associations, especially with coronary heart disease, the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is of prognostic significance. The clinical management of IC should include relief of symptoms combined with prevention of secondary cardiovascular complications, e.g. acute thrombotic events causing limb- or life-threatening ischaemia, which are often due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture leading to thrombotic vessel occlusion. Many patients with PAD do not receive an optimum package of secondary prevention, tailored to include maximum cholesterol reduction, BP and glycaemic control, ACE inhibition and single or combination anti-platelet therapy. This review considers recent information from large secondary prevention trials, e.g. the PAD subgroups within the HOPE, CAPRIE and statin studies. Slowing progression of atherosclerosis, and inducing stabilisation and regression of atheromatous plaques, is now feasible using long-term combination drug therapy. The phrase angle quotation mark, leftangle quotation mark, leftconservative therapyangle quotation mark, rightangle quotation mark, right, popular among vascular surgeons, implies a passive minimal-intervention strategy of surveillance and lifestyle advice; such terminology is perhaps no longer appropriate since considerable improvements in survival are likely to accrue if all patients with PAD, especially those with low ABPI, receive vigorous, titrated medical therapies, tailored to individual patients, as part of an evidence-based secondary prevention regime.",

Male heterozygous TGRen2 rats (5 weeks old) were allocated to receive MDL-100,240, ramipril (RAM) or placebo (PLAC) for 4 weeks, during which blood pressure (BP) was measured. We then evaluated: 1) left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV), brain, kidney and adrenals weight; 2) structural changes in the aorta and the mesenteric arterioles wall; 3) tension responses of segments of the aorta to phenylephrine, KCl, and endothelin-1; and 4) creatinine, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and cyclic GMP (cGMP) plasma levels. Compared to PLAC, both MDL-100,240 and RAM significantly (P < .001) lowered BP (after 4 weeks: 255 +/- 15 mm Hg PLAC, v 174 +/- 6 MDL-100,240, v 166 +/- 5 RAM).

Almost all DN in African Americans is caused by type 2 diabetes. Glycemic control and control of blood pressure are essential to prolong renal survival and to protect against cardiovascular events. Among African Americans, diabetic nephropathy seems to affect women more than men, which may be related to increased rates of obesity and diabetes in African American women. In addition to gender, the development of albuminuria, family history, and possibly birth weight are factors that predict progression of renal disease in African Americans with DN. The impact of glycemic control, appropriate antihypertensives, and the optimal level of blood pressure control in African Americans with advanced DN require further study.

    "616": "Chronic treatment with alacepril improved maximal exercise capacity in patients with heart failure. The increased peak VO2 was primarily due to the increased cardiac index, but not due to the widening of arteriovenous oxygen difference. Therapy-induced increase in stroke volume index may contribute to the increased cardiac index at peak exercise in our patients with heart failure.", 
    "617": "Due to the discovery of nonpeptic ligands, the receptors for angiotensin (Ang) II are classified into two subtypes (AT1-R and AT2-R). AT1-R mediates most of the cardiovascular actions of Ang II. AT2-R is expressed at very high levels in the developing fetus. Its expression is very low in the cardiovascular system of the adult. The expression of AT2-R can be modulated by pathological states associated with tissue remodeling or inflammation. In failing hearts or neointima formation after vascular injury, AT2-R is reexpressed in cells proliferating in interstitial regions or neointima and exerts an inhibitory effect on Ang II-induced mitogen signals or synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in attenuation of the tissue remodeling. An extreme form of cell growth inhibition ends in programmed cell death, and this process, which is initiated by the withdrawal of growth factors, is also enhanced by AT2-R. Cardiac myocyte- or vascular smooth muscle-specific mice that overexpress AT2-R display an inhibition of Ang II-induced chronotropic or pressor actions, suggesting the role of AT2-R on the activity of cardiac pacemaker cells and the maintenance of vascular resistance. AT2-R also activates the kinin/nitric oxide/cGMP system in the cardiovascular and renal systems, resulting in AT2-R-mediated cardioprotection, vasodilation and pressure natriuresis. These effects, transmitted by AT2-R, are mainly exerted by stimulation of protein tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphatases in a Gi-protein-dependent manner. The expression level of AT2-R is much higher in human hearts than in rodent hearts, and the AT2-R-mediated actions are likely enhanced, especially by clinical application of AT1-R antagonists. Thus, in this review, the regulation of AT2-R expression, its cellular localization, its pathological role in cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and pharmacotherapeutic effects of AT2-R stimulation are discussed.",

    "629": "In the past decade, advances in molecular genetics have shown that many familial neuromuscular and cardiovascular diseases share a common pathophysiology. They are caused by inherited mutations in the cellular cytoskeleton of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. The clinical manifestation of cardiac disease in neuromuscular disorders is common and their management should include both periodic cardiac assessment and appropriate symptomatic and definitive therapy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a common complication of neuromuscular diseases. Cardiac function may decline progressively as part of the natural history of the disease, but current medical therapy, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics, can be used to alleviate symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction. Conduction disturbances may be an important cause of mortality, especially in patients with Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy, and thus pacemaker implantation can be life-saving. Rhythm disturbances, such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, have been reported in patients with neuromuscular diseases. Treatment is based on preventing sudden death and embolic phenomena and cardioverting or controlling atrial fibrillation. In these patients, problems may arise with anticoagulation and antiarrhythmic therapy due to the inherent locomotor instability associated with the disease, and the presence of concomitant atrioventricular disease. Although uncommon, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be a feature of some neuromuscular disorders. Patients should undergo regular risk stratification for sudden cardiac death and symptoms such as heart failure can be treated with medical therapy.", 
    "630": "For both primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), it is prudent to use strategies that are of proven benefit and that do not harm patients. In all women, these strategies include lifestyle approaches such as smoking avoidance, proper nutrition, and regular exercise. Lipid-lowering and blood pressure control with pharmacotherapy are indicated in women who do not meet target lipid or blood pressure levels with lifestyle interventions. For women with CHD, aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be considered. Widespread under-use of established preventive therapies has been documented in women. These interventions should be emphasized in clinical practice. For secondary prevention of CHD in women, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends against initiating hormone replacement therapy (HRT) based on studies that have shown no benefit and early harm. For patients with CHD already on HRT, the decision to continue or stop HRT should be based on established noncoronary benefits and risks and patient preference. There are insufficient data to suggest that HRT should be initiated for the sole purpose of primary prevention of CHD. Because the new AHA guidelines recommend placing significant weight on the noncardiac benefits and risks of HRT, it is important to become familiar with these noncardiac effects. It is also important to understand the evidence supporting the AHA's decision to recommend placing relatively less weight on the cardiac effects of HRT.", 
    "631": "Postinfarction left ventricular remodeling begins early after acute myocardial infarction and may continue for months to years afterward. Early re-establishment of flow in the occluded artery is associated with smaller left ventricular cavity volumes and reduced remodeling. Acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy (for patients more than 1 hour away from a catheterization facility) as early as possible after symptoms is critical. Late reperfusion (PCI more than 12 hours after infarction) may prove useful, and this will be determined by the results of ongoing clinical trials. Recurrent MI is reduced by antiplatelet agents (aspirin in most patients) and by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Intravenous nitroglycerin may limit early (initial 24 hours) dilatation following infarction, but long-term use in asymptomatic patients is not efficacious. Beta- adrenergic receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have independent efficacy in attenuating the early and late phases of remodeling. The combined use of a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor has greater efficacy than either agent alone, provided they are tolerated hemodynamically. Although angiotensin II receptor antagonists have similar efficacy to ACE inhibitors and have fewer side effects, the angiotensin II receptor blockers should be reserved for patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors. In patients requiring diuretic therapy, spironolactone is preferred because of its salutary properties regarding extracellular matrix remodeling, specifically in reducing fibrosis. Surgical revascularization with or without associated mitral valve repair is useful in selected patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation or hibernating myocardium. New therapies directed at modulating the remodeling process may focus on manipulating the components of the extracellular matrix to reduce the deleterious impact of this process.",

Data of 7,647 cases from 156 facilities were obtained. These cases were divided into 2 groups, a non-elderly group (under 65 years, 3,396 cases) and an elderly group (65 years or over, 4,012 cases). The blood pressure at the start of pharmacological treatment was 174.9 +/- 17.4/93.7 +/- 11.0 mmHg (mean +/- SD) in the elderly group, and 170.6 +/- 17.8/98.6 +/- 11.2 mmHg in the non-elderly group. Systolic blood pressure in the elderly group was higher than in that the non-elderly group and diastolic blood pressure was lower in the elderly group than that in the non-elderly group. Cases of ECG (98.3% vs 71.3%; the non-elderly group vs the elderly group), chest X-ray (86.5% vs 65.2%), UCG (27.1% vs 23.7%), urinary test (96.0% vs 69.3%), examination of ophthalmic fundi (27.0% vs 24.3%), were much lower in the elderly group than in the non-elderly group. The rate of positive findings of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG criteria (24.8% vs 20.3%), cardiomegaly by chest X-p (35.3% vs 26.6%), proteinuria by urinary test (14.8% vs 12.9%) was lower in the elderly than non-elderly. Details of drug use in non-elderly vs elderly were as follows; calcium antagonists (47.3% vs 51.9%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) (14.2% vs 12.2%), diuretics (6.3% vs 10.2%), beta-blockers (11.2% vs 4.7%), alpha-blockers (1.4% vs 1.3%), others (1.5% vs 2.4%), multiple (13.7% vs 12.5%), undefined (4.2% vs 4.7%). Sufficient hypotensive effects were obtained in 61.5% of the non-elderly, and 68.5% of the elderly. Initial physical examination to assess target organ damage was lower in the elderly than the non-elderly. It was thought necessary to be corrected. The incidence of main antihypertensive drugs in the elderly were Ca antagonists, ACE-I and diuretics. Treatment trends met the Japanese guideline on treatment of hypertension in the elderly.", 
    "637": "When steroids and immunosuppressive drugs were the only available pharmacological agents used to treat membranous nephropathy, nephrologists were polarized into two groups, those supporting therapy on the basis of the results achieved in controlled trials and those opposed to therapy who contended that the side-effects of therapy were too severe to consider in a disease with a relatively benign course. These two groups are drawing closer as treatments with lesser side-effects emerge. The demonstration that proteinuria accelerates progressive kidney failure in all renal diseases led to a major focus on control of proteinuria. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and angiotensin II receptor antagonists all play a role. Older methods of treatment that reduce proteinuria are being resurrected. A major development is the demonstration in a randomized study that cyclosporin A is effective in membranous nephropathy. Therefore, although there has been no major recent breakthrough or novel therapeutic agent used in membranous nephropathy, a range of new methods of controlling proteinuria provide some compromise between therapeutic enthusiasm and conservative management in this common disorder.", 
    "638": "It was previously reported that transgenic (mRen-2)27 rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus progressively develop advanced nephropathy in 12 wk. These lesions are largely prevented when the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril is administered from the time of induction of diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to determine the lowest dose of early perindopril treatment required for substantial improvement of renal function and structure and to investigate whether late intervention prevents or reverses the progression of established renal lesions. At 6 wk of age, female heterozygous Ren-2 rats were randomized to receive either streptozotocin (diabetic) or citrate buffer (control). Rats were gavaged, beginning early after the induction of diabetes mellitus or the administration of control vehicle, with 0, 0.02, 0.2, or 2 mg/kg per d perindopril for 12 wk. A separate group of diabetic Ren-2 rats received late treatment with 2 mg/kg per d perindopril throughout week 8 to week 12, when rats were hypertensive and albuminuric and exhibited increased kidney weight and glomerulosclerotic index (GSI). Among diabetic rats, early 0.02 mg/kg per d perindopril treatment reduced systolic BP, GSI, and renal collagen staining but had no effect on albuminuria or kidney hypertrophy. Early 0.2 or 2 mg/kg per d perindopril treatment further reduced systolic BP, GSI, and renal collagen staining and decreased albuminuria and kidney hypertrophy. Late intervention was as antihypertensive and antialbuminuric as early 0.2 or 2 mg/kg per d perindopril treatment but did not prevent a moderate increase in GSI. In conclusion, early treatment with 0.2 mg/kg per d perindopril was the lowest dosage to largely prevent severe diabetic nephropathy in transgenic Ren-2 rats. Late-onset perindopril treatment of diabetic rats with established nephropathy was as efficacious as early treatment with respect to various renal parameters, such as albuminuria, but was associated with moderate progression of glomerulosclerosis.",

In contrast, in vivo studies suggest that Ang II inhibits pancreatic secretion. To further assess Ang II's influence on pancreatic secretion, we examined the effect of captopril on secretin-stimulated pancreatic output.", 
    "640": "After a 30-min basal period, four conscious dogs with chronic gastric and Herrera pancreatic fistulas received an intravenous bolus of captopril (0.1 mg/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (25 microg/kg/min). Control studies were performed with volume- and rate-matched saline infusion. After 1 h, secretin infusion was begun at 16 ng/kg/h, doubling the dose every 30 min. Pancreatic juice was analyzed for bicarbonate and protein. A paired t test was used to assess statistical significance.", 
    "641": "When compared to controls, pancreatic bicarbonate outputs were lower during captopril administration; the difference between captopril and control was statistically significant at the highest secretin dose. Protein outputs also appeared lower during captopril administration, although these differences were not statistically significant.",

    "643": "We compared the efficacy of treatment protocols with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor alone (enalapril, 5 mg) or angiotensin II (ATII) receptor blocker (losartan, 50 mg) or both enalapril plus losartan in patients with microalbuminuria in a prospective, randomized clinical trial. Normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria documented by at least 3 consecutive urinary albumin excretion analyses were recruited for the study. Patients were grouped randomly into one of the protocols which consisted of treatment with 5 mg enalapril daily (group 1; n=12), 50 mg losartan daily (group 2; n=12) or both drugs (group 3; n=10). They were reevaluated with regard to HbA1c levels, lipid profiles, blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion rates (UAER) at 3-month intervals for 12 months. Mean age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, plasma lipid profiles and blood pressure levels were similar at the initial visit. In group 1, UAER returned to normal levels in 10 patients. Normalization of UAER occurred in 8 and 7 patients in groups 2 and 3, respectively. Percentage of reduction in UAERs at the end of 12 months were 58%, 59% and 60% (p=0.0001; p=0.0002; p=0.0003, respectively). The amount of reduction in UAER did not differ significantly among the three groups (p=0.346). ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers have similar efficacy in treating diabetic microalbuminuria, and the combination of the two drugs does not add any further benefit.", 
    "644": "The present study was designed to examine whether long-term blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with perindopril ameliorates dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Twelve patients with proven CAD were randomly divided in two groups; one group received perindopril (8 mg/day, p.o.) for 3 months and another group served as a control. To evaluate anti-ischemic effects of perindopril, dobutamine stress echocardiography was performed before and 3 months after the treatment in a double-blind manner. Long-term treatment with perindopril significantly ameliorated the dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, as evaluated by time to the onset of symptoms, magnitude of electrocardiographic ST-segment changes, and left ventricular wall motion score (all P<0.05). The treatment significantly decreased serum ACE activities (P<0.01) and increased plasma bradykinin concentrations (P<0.05). The extent of reduction of left ventricular wall motion score by perindopril was closely correlated with that of inhibition of serum ACE activities (P<0.01) and with that of increase in plasma bradykinin concentrations (P<0.05). By contrast, no such beneficial changes were noted in the control group. These results provide the first evidence that long-term treatment with perindopril exerts anti-ischemic effects on the myocardial ischemia induced by increased myocardial oxygen demand in patients with CAD.",

Antihypertensive drugs were titrated and combined to reduce the daytime diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg. Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and follow-up. Mean systolic/diastolic clinic BP, 24-hour BP, and LVM index were similar in previously untreated (n=64) and previously treated (n=109) patients and averaged 171/102 mm Hg, 151/97 mm Hg, and 118 g/m2, respectively. At 4 months, these values had decreased (P<0.001) by 26/12 mm Hg, 23/14 mm Hg, and 14 g/m2 in previously untreated patients and by 22/9 mm Hg, 21/13 mm Hg, and 19 g/m2 in previously treated patients. In the previously untreated patients, the regression in LVM index correlated to a similar degree (P=0.09) with the decreases in the conventional (r=0.34; P=0.005) and the 24-hour (r=0.26; P=0.04) systolic BP. In the previously treated patients, the corresponding correlations were 0.02 (P=0.82) and -0.10 (P=0.32), respectively.

In 1992, beta blockers were also less used in diabetics (21 versus 33%, p=0.001). In contrast, ACE inhibitors were more used (43 versus 35%, p=0.06). In both surveys and populations, other classes (reserpin, vasodilator and alpha blockers) had minor place in the strategy. The frequency of combinations of antihypertensive drugs was similar in both surveys and populations.

We examined the effects of ramipril alone or with furosemide on ECM in a heart failure model. HF was induced by occlusion of the left coronary artery in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rats were assigned to placebo (n=9), ramipril 1 mg/kg/day (n=11), furosemide 2 x 2 mg/kg/day (n=7) or both (1 mg/kg/day + 2 x 2 mg/kg/day n=8). LV-function, collagen content, MMP/TIMP (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases) protein- and mRNA-expression were examined in non-infarcted LV tissue. MMP-2/TIMP-4 ratio was increased in HF. Ramipril reduced MMP-2 expression (active form), collagen type I mRNA expression and content and increased TIMP-4 levels associated with decreased left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), mortality rate and increased LV pressure (LVP). Combination therapy with furosemide is less efficient with regard to collagen content and MMP-2 (active form) reduction but did not worsen beneficial effects of ramipril on LV function and mortality rate. Furosemide alone had no effect on MMP-2 (active form) expression, collagen content, LV function and mortality rate. Prevention of LV dilatation by ramipril was associated with decreased gelatinolytic activity and increased MMP-inhibition in heart failure SHR. Furthermore, ramipril reduced fibrosis by enhanced interstitial collagenase expression. Furosemide did not show the beneficial effects of ramipril on ECM remodeling but did not worsen LV function. Positive effects of furosemide treatment alone on LV remodeling and function were not observed.",

Sixty point nine percent of the inpatients were followed up. The incidences of compliance were 63.4% in the inpatients, 77.3% when being discharged, and 43.7% in the outpatients. The cause of uncompliance were as follows: side-effect of the medication, failure to control BP, financial problems, etc. Data gathered during follow up period, it was found the side effect of the calcium antagonist and the diuretics improved palpably. Those compliers controlled their BP well, while little fluctuation of BP was observed. However, the uncompliers showed different pictures, and the range of fluctuation of BP was large.",

    "663": "The present study describes the effects of losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, echocardiographically calculated left ventricular mass, renal function evaluated by glomerular filtration rate and quality of life. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is of importance for cardiovascular growth. There is substantial experimental documentation in animals that the angiotensin II antagonist, losartan, decreases the cardiac hypertrophy response caused by elevated arterial pressure as well as intravascular volume overload. However, data in humans is scarce. This is a 3-year, randomised, double-blind study with parallel group design in 50 patients with essential hypertension. The results show that both drugs reduced blood pressure equally effectively, and also left ventricular mass (P < 0.001). After 3 years of treatment glomerular filtration rate significantly increased with losartan (P < 0.005). Serum uric acid fell modestly although significantly, dose-dependent in losartan patients compared with an increase in enalapril patients. A fall in serum potassium from the pre-study period was observed in all patients. There was no difference between treatments in terms of patient satisfaction on quality of life. Both drugs have relatively similar hormonal and haemodynamic effect, with an excellent tolerability profile; they appear to induce comparable blood pressure falls in hypertensive patients in particular, therapy based on specific Ang II blockade may offer advantages in high risk hypertensives if left ventricular hypertrophy is present. Both enalapril and losartan, in improving the renal function attenuating the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II, might be able to reverse the pathophysiology of essential hypertensive kidney disease, and should be first-choice drugs in the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "664": "Congestive heart failure affects >5% of those aged 65-75 and 10-20% of those aged >80 in the UK, and levels are likely to rise in the wake of improved therapies for hypertension and myocardial infarction. It is often multifactorial in this group. The most common causes are hypertension and coronary heart disease, with valvular heart disease playing an increasing role. The most common precipitant of pre-existing heart failure is non-compliance with medication or diet; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are particularly likely to exacerbate the condition. Diagnosis may be difficult since typical signs are often absent or masked in older people, but plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide appear to be a reliable indicator and may provide diagnostic test in the future. Systolic heart failure is managed by conventional therapy (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers). The management of diastolic heart failure is less well defined, but symptoms should be managed, ischaemia prevented and the underlying causes identified and treated. Nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention (including education of patient and family, social support, review of medication, dietary modification and weight monitoring) have resulted in improvements in event-free survival and quality of life.",

The incidence is about one new case per 1000 of the general population per year, increasing to >10 per 1000 in those aged >or=85 years. Although the evidence that beta-blockers reduce mortality by about 36% when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is overwhelming, clinicians are still reluctant to use beta-blockers in heart failure, especially in older patients. Here, we examine the evidence for the use of beta-blockers in heart failure in older people and explore the practicalities of their use.",

A total of 253 patients successfully treated for coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to quinapril or control. Of the 215 patients who completed the follow-up, we determined gene polymorphisms in 204 patients with 241 lesions who provided blood samples for genotype determination. In the control, the ACE D homozygotes showed a smaller minimal lumen diameter (MLD) at follow-up (P=0.063). The other two genotypes of AGT and AT1R did not affect restenosis after PCI. According to quinapril treatment, the AGT T homozygotes significantly showed a beneficial effect of quinapril on MLD (P=0.013) and late lumen loss (P=0.013). The ACE I homozygotes also exhibited beneficial effects of quinapril on larger MLD (P=0.065). The AT1R genotype did not influence the quinapril effect. In conclusion, the AGT T homozygotes might benefit from effects of quinapril on preventing restenosis after PCI.",

Reduction of proteinuria in rats treated with enalapril and losartan was associated with a reduction in Ang II levels in both the peri-infarct and intact portions of the remnant kidney. By contrast, nifedipine increased Ang II levels in the intact portion of the remnant kidney.

During the long-term study, among 235 patients who achieved initial blood pressure normalisation with the fixed combination, 79.8% sustained their normalisation over 1 year, with no significant difference regarding safety criteria: the occurrence of adverse drug reactions per patient per year was 0.37 and 0.28 in the combination and placebo groups, respectively. A significantly (P < 0.05) larger blood pressure decreasing effect on nocturnal mean SBP (by ABPM) was demonstrated for the combination compared with that achieved with losartan, with no difference in safety.",

It is noted that in principle no innovations are to be expected from generics, since these substances are are not the subject of specific research. Although large-scale clinical studies in recent years have identified a new indication--cardiac insufficiency--for the beta blockers metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol, this must not be considered an innovation in the sense of a new development. The translatability of the study results to uninvestigated substances is uncertain.

    "701": "Chronic inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis by the administration of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) to rats induces early vascular inflammation (monocyte infiltration into coronary vessels and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression) as well as subsequent arteriosclerosis. The small GTPase Rho controls cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation and is activated by several growth factors such as angiotensin II. We investigated the effect of a specific inhibitor of Rho-kinase, Y-27632, in rats treated with L-NAME to determine the role of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway in the development of arteriosclerosis. We found here increased activity of Rho/Rho-kinase after L-NAME administration and its prevention by angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade. Hydralazine or lecithinized superoxide dismutase (l-SOD) did not affect Rho/Rho-kinase activity. Co-treatment with Y-27632 did not affect the L-NAME-induced increase in cardiovascular tissue ACE activity or L-NAME-induced decrease in plasma NO concentrations, but did prevent the L-NAME-induced early inflammation and late coronary arteriosclerosis. In addition, Y-27632 prevented the increased gene expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and transforming growth factor-beta1 as well as cardiac fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. These findings suggest that increased activity of Rho/Rho-kinase pathway mediated via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor may thus be important in the pathogenesis of early vascular inflammation and late remodeling induced by chronic inhibition of NO synthesis. The beneficial effects of Rho-kinase inhibition are not mediated by restoration of NO production. The Rho-kinase pathway could be a new therapeutic target for treatment of vascular diseases.",

    "709": "Given the significant public health impact of stroke and the identification of nonmodifiable (age, gender, race/ethnicity) and modifiable (blood pressure, diabetes, lipid profile, and lifestyle) risk factors, early prevention strategies should be initiated. When a patient suffers a stroke, the focus of care becomes prevention of future events. For the patient with diabetes, comprehensive medical management of ischaemic stroke (primary or secondary prevention) includes antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy, as well as antiplatelet therapy. Despite the cerebrovascular risk reduction with these modalities, clearly new agents are needed. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study provides compelling evidence that treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, can further reduce the risk of stroke in high-risk patients by mechanisms other than lowering blood pressure. In HOPE, patients were normotensive at baseline. Therefore, for the first time, in a patient population without left ventricular dysfunction, the effects of an ACE inhibitor ramipril on reducing stroke risk were demonstrated. Ramipril 10 mg achieved a significant 33% reduction in stroke among patients with diabetes. Based on the HOPE study, the recently published American Heart Association guidelines for the primary prevention of stroke recommend ramipril to prevent stroke in high-risk patients and in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Wide-scale adherence to these guideline recommendations for the prevention of primary and secondary stroke would significantly benefit the public health.", 
    "710": "Experimental and clinical evidence suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk by directly affecting endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and thrombus formation. These direct effects are in addition to effects on vascular tone or pressure.

In the overall HOPE population, the risk of the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) was reduced by 22% (p < 0.001), and in patients with diabetes plus one other CV risk, it was reduced by 25% (p = 0.0004). Ramipril treatment achieved risk reduction in patients with mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > or = 1.4 mg/dl). Ramipril treatment did not increase adverse events in patients with renal insufficiency. The Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound changes in patients treated with Ramipril and Vitamin E (SECURE) demonstrated that ramipril 10 mg significantly reduced the rate of carotid intimal medial thickening, suggesting a direct effect on atherosclerotic progression.", 
    "711": "Individuals with diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, a risk that is significantly greater in the presence of traditional CV risk factors (hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, prothrombotic state). Glucose control and management of these risk factors decreases but does not eliminate CV events, reflecting the complexity of atherosclerosis. Novel risk factors (C-reactive protein, lipoprotein a, homocysteine, and endothelial dysfunction) have been proposed and are potentially modifiable. However, clinical trials data are not yet available to guide therapy. At this time, no single agent can achieve adequate risk reduction in patients with diabetes. Even with the use of multiple agents and classes of agents to manage CV risk, 75% of patients with diabetes are expected to die from CV causes. Despite the recent advances in primary and secondary prevention of CV events, new approaches are needed. Data from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial demonstrated that CV risk can be further reduced by the addition of the ACE inhibitor ramipril to the existing treatment regimen of high-risk patients with diabetes.",

Despite state-of-the-art treatment including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and spironolactone, survival and relief from symptoms still are unacceptably poor in patients with chronic heart failure. The present article gives an overview of current limitations in the treatment of heart failure and points out possible treatment options in the future. It seems possible to reduce or at least delay progression of heart failure by adding drugs that interfere with novel pathophysiologic aspects in heart failure activation of the neuroendocrine system, including catecholamines, angiotensin II, cytokines, and endothelins, as well as alteration of calcium homeostasis and energy depletion.", 
    "713": "Bradykinin is formed by the interaction of factor XII, prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen on negatively charged inorganic surfaces (silicates, urate, and pyrophosphate) or macromolecular organic surfaces (heparin, other mucopolysaccharides, and sulfatides) or on assembly along the surface of cells. Catalysis along the cell surface requires zinc-dependent binding of factor XII and high-molecular-weight kininogen to proteins, such as the receptor for the globular heads of the C1q subcomponent of complement, cytokeratin 1, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. These 3 proteins complex together within the cell membrane, and initiation depends on autoactivation of factor XII on binding to gC1qR (the receptor for the globular heads of the C1q subcomponent of complement). There is also a factor XII-independent bypass mechanism requiring a cell-derived cofactor or protease that activates prekallikrein. Bradykinin is degraded by carboxypeptidase N and angiotensin-converting enzyme. Angioedema that is bradykinin dependent results from hereditary or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiencies or use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to treat hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, or scleroderma. The role for bradykinin in allergic rhinitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis is to contribute to tissue hyperresponsiveness, local inflammation, and hypotension. Activation of the plasma cascade occurs as a result of heparin release and endothelial-cell activation and as a secondary event caused by other pathways of inflammation.",

Spectral characteristics of FAPGG are investigated. The Burger-Lambert-Bar dependence is not observed in any of the working concentrations. Extension of the spectral weight band is associated with the appearance of the absorbency/concentration linear function for FAPGG solution. Under such conditions the registered intensity of the analyzer sign (delta OD/min) is in strong correlation with the spectral weight band. As a result, high inter-analyzer variations were observed. This impedes the standardization of the method and prompts the use of attested calibrators. Linear function of analyzer's sign and ACE level is theoretically achieved at FAPGG concentration 1.0 +/- 0.2 mM (Km = 0.35 +/- 0.05 mM, minimum saturation concentration 1.4 +/- 0.2 mM).

We prospectively examined patients to determine whether age, sex, ethnicity, mean blood pressure, plasma creatinine, urine protein excretion, and cigarette smoking predict renal function decline in type 2 DN treated toward the recommended mean blood pressure goal of 92 mm Hg (about 125/75 mm Hg) with antihypertensives including ACE inhibitors. Thirty-three DN patients with initial plasma creatinine less than 1.4 mg/dL were followed 64.0 +/- 1.1 months. After correcting for differences in follow-up time, demographic variables, and other relevant variables, plasma creatinine increased, indicating renal function decline despite mean blood pressure reduction to 92 +/- 1 mm Hg and administration of ACE inhibitors. Regression analysis showed that smoking was the only examined parameter that significantly predicted renal function decline. Smokers (n = 13) and nonsmokers (n = 20) had similar follow-up (61.4 +/- 2.1 months versus 65.7 +/- 1.1 months), mean blood pressure (91 +/- 1 mm Hg versus 92 +/- 1 mm Hg), and initial plasma creatinine (1.05 +/- 0.08 mg/dL versus 1.08 +/- 0.03 mg/dL). Nevertheless, follow-up plasma creatinine was higher in smokers than nonsmokers (1.78 +/- 0.20 mg/dL versus 1.32 +/- 0.04 mg/dL). The data show that renal function declines faster in smokers than nonsmokers with type 2 DN undergoing treatment to improve blood pressure including ACE inhibitors. Cigarette smoking remains a risk factor for renal function decline in type 2 DN despite currently recommended therapy.", 
    "725": "The majority of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are hypertensive. Hypertension in the hemodialysis patient population is multifactorial. Further, hypertension is associated with an increased risk for left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular complications, and mortality. Antihypertensive medications alone do not adequately control blood pressure (BP) in hemodialysis patients. There are, however, several therapeutic options available to normalize BP in these patients, often without the need for additional drug therapy (eg, long, slow hemodialysis; short, daily hemodialysis; nocturnal hemodialysis; or, most effectively, dietary salt and fluid restriction in combination with reduction of dialysate sodium concentration). Optimal BP in dialysis patients is not different from recommendations for the general population, even though definite evidence is not yet available. Predialysis systolic and diastolic BPs are of particular importance. Left ventricular mass correlates with predialysis systolic BP. Survival is better in hemodialysis patients with a mean arterial pressure below 99 mm Hg as compared with those with higher BP. Low predialysis systolic BP (<110 mm Hg) and low predialysis diastolic BP (<70 mm Hg) are associated with increased mortality, primarily because of severe congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease. Patients that experience repeated intradialytic hypotensive episodes should also be viewed with caution, and predialytic BP values should be reevaluated. A possible treatment option for these patients may be slow, long hemodialysis; short, daily hemodialysis; or nocturnal hemodialysis. Among the antihypertensive agents currently available, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to have the greatest ability to reduce left ventricular mass. Pressure load can be satisfactorily determined by using the average value of predialysis BP measurements over 1 month. In selected hemodialysis patients, interdialytic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) may help to determine if the patient is in fact hypertensive. In addition, ABPM provides important information about the change in BP between day and night. Regular home BP monitoring, yearly echocardiography, and treatment of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease are recommended.", 
    "726": "Sibutramine treatment in obesity results in significantly greater weight reduction compared with placebo, although weight loss with sibutramine may be accompanied by small but statistically significant mean increases in blood pressure (BP). This 52-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study investigated the effects of sibutramine 20 mg once daily or placebo on body weight in 220 obese (body mass index (BMI) 27-40 kg/m2), hypertensive patients. At randomisation, hypertension was well controlled (< or = 95 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, with or without concomitant thiazide diuretic therapy. Therapy for hypertension continued for the 52 weeks of the study. Sibutramine 20 mg produced significantly greater weight loss compared with placebo: 4.5 kg with sibutramine compared with 0.4 kg with placebo (last observation carried forward (LOCF); P < or = 0.05). A total of 62 patients (42.8%) treated with sibutramine lost < or = 5% of their body weight compared with six patients (8.3%) treated with placebo; 19 patients (13.1%) treated with sibutramine lost > or = 10% of their body weight compared with two patients (2.8%) treated with placebo (LOCF; P < or = 0.05 for both comparisons). Hypertension remained well controlled for the 52 weeks of the study with both sibutramine and placebo treatment. After 52 weeks, the differences between placebo treatment and sibutramine treatment for both mean supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were approximately 3 mm Hg: mean DBP was 82.8 mm Hg with placebo treatment compared with 85.5 mm Hg with sibutramine treatment (LOCF; P = 0.004) and mean SBP was 130.4 mm Hg with placebo compared with 133.1 mm Hg with sibutramine (LOCF; P = 0.0497; both comparisons, sibutramine vs placebo). The mean increases in SBP and DBP did not appear to change the overall risk category for coronary heart disease end points. Changes in pulse rate at week 52 were a decrease of 0.3 beats per minute (bpm) for placebo treatment compared with an increase of 5.7 bpm for sibutramine treatment (P < 0.001). Mandated withdrawals from the study due to protocol-defined changes in BP were not statistically different between the two treatment groups. Greater favourable changes in lipid profile, serum glucose, and uric acid could be accounted for by greater weight losses occurring in the sibutramine treatment group. Sibutramine was well tolerated. This study indicates that in obese patients whose hypertension is well controlled at the outset with an ACE inhibitor, with or without concomitant thiazide diuretic therapy, sibutramine safely and effectively achieves weight loss without compromising good BP control.",

    "728": "Despite therapeutic advances in heart failure treatment, this syndrome still presents a poor prognosis, with a relevant mortality due to both systolic dysfunction progression and sudden death. Sudden cardiac death appears to be relatively more frequent in less compromised patients (NYHA functional class I) but in absolute numbers it is more frequent in more functionally compromised patients. The ability to predict sudden cardiac events with current available tests is poor, with the possible exception of electrophysiological test in ischemic cardiomyopathy. The risk of sudden death is proven to be increased in more advanced cardiac dysfunction and frequently the acute event can be precipitated by ischemia. Therefore the best approach in the prevention of sudden cardiac death may well be the proper treatment of ischemia and cardiac dysfunction. Beta-blockers have demonstrated a favorable effect in the prevention of sudden cardiac death. ACE-inhibitors can significantly reduce global death in heart failure patients, but their impact on sudden death appears to be limited. The same may be true for angiotensin II blockers. Diuretics have generally been demonstrated to increase sudden death, possibly via electrolyte imbalance; this may explain why spironolactone has a pronounced impact in reducing sudden death. Inotropes, in spite of their good effect on refractory heart failure and their usefulness in the compassionate care of terminally ill heart failure patients, have demonstrated an increase in sudden cardiac death. The same holds true for digoxin, in spite of its ability to reduce death due to heart failure deterioration. Antiarrhythmic drugs, with the possible exception of amiodarone, have demonstrated an unfavorable effect on sudden death incidence.", 
    "729": "Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardio (GISSI)-Prevenzione was conceived as a population, pragmatic trial on patients with recent myocardial infarctions conducted in the framework of the Italian public health system. In GISSI-Prevenzione, patients were invited to follow Mediterranean dietary habits, and were treated with up-to-date preventive pharmacological interventions. Long-term n-3 PUFA (1 g daily) but not vitamin E (300 mg daily) was beneficial for death and for combined death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. All the benefit, however, was attributable to the decrease in risk for overall, cardiovascular, cardiac, coronary, and sudden death. At variance with the orientation of a scientific scenario largely dominated by the \"cholesterol-heart hypothesis,\" GISSI-Prevenzione results indicate n-3 PUFA (virtually devoid of any cholesterol-lowering effect) as a relevant pharmacological treatment for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. As to the relevance and comparability of GISSI-Prevenzione results, up to 5.7 lives could be saved every 1000 patients with previous myocardial infarction treated with n-3 PUFA (1 g daily) per year. Such a result is comparable to that observed in the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) trial, where 5.2 lives could be saved per 1000 hypercholesterolemic, coronary heart disease patients treated with pravastatin for 1 yr. The choice of a relatively low-dose regimen (1-g capsule daily) more acceptable for long-term treatment in a population of patients following Mediterranean dietary habits, and the pattern of effects seen in GISSI-Prevenzione (namely, reduction of overall mortality with no decrease in the rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction) all strongly suggest that n-3 PUFA treatment should be considered a recommended new component of secondary prevention. The importance of this combined/additive effect is further suggested by the analyses of the interplay between diet and n-3 PUFA: There is an interesting direct correlation between size of the effect and \"correctness\" of background diets. It can be anticipated that a conceptual barrier must be overcome: A \"dietary drug\" should be added to \"dietary advice,\" which remains fundamental to allow this statement to become true in clinical practice.",

The glass transition temperature, Tg, of all samples was measured by differential scanning calorimetry.", 
    "733": "Samples were first examined by varying the Tg and maintaining the initial solution pH constant. At pH 2.49 the rate of reaction was found to be less dependent on the sample Tg, whereas at pH > or = 2.75 the rate decreased with an increase in Tg. In a second set of experiments at a constant Tg of approximately 70 degrees C, the reaction rate increased as the pH increased.", 
    "734": "The overall solid-state chemical reactivity of amorphous quinapril depends on the relative amount of QHCI and Q+-, the zwitterionic form of quinapril. At high proportions of Q+- (higher pH values) the reaction rate seems to be strongly influenced by the Tg of the mixture, and hence the molecular mobility, whereas at higher proportions of QHCI (lower pH) the reaction rate is less sensitive to Tg, presumably because of different mechanistic rate determining steps for the two sets of conditions.",

Untreated, it may result in end stage renal disease (ESRD) in as little as four months. The incidence of HIVAN continues to increase and is the single most common cause of chronic renal disease in HIV-1 seropositive patients. It affects predominantly black individuals. Exact pathogenesis is still not clear but a great deal of progress has been made in the recent past by studies on transgenic mouse model, renal cell cultures and from study of human biopsy material. Current considerations revolve around the role of HIV or protein in renal epithelium and the effects of cytokines, including transforming growth factor-beta and basic fibroblast growth factor on renal structures. Different modalities of treatment with corticosteroids, zidovudine or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been tried with modest success.",

In the first study, pharmacokinetics (AUC, Cmax, tmax, t 1/2) and ACE inhibition (up to 72 h) were investigated following single oral doses of 15 mg moexipril administered in the fasting and postprandial state (n = 24). The individual ACE inhibition data and plasma concentration data were fitted to an Emax model. In the second study, carried out in 52 volunteers, the pharmacokinetics were followed over 36 h following administration of 2 single oral doses of 15 mg moexipril. In the third study, the pharmacokinetics after multiple dosing of 15 mg moexipril once daily for 5 days were investigated in 12 young and 12 elderly subjects.",

Compared to fasting, the postprandial moexiprilat Cmax and AUC (ratio fed/fasted 58.0%; 90% CI 52.2-64.5%) were distinctly reduced (ANOVA p = 0.0001). Moexiprilat showed a biphasic elimination phase with an average t 1/2 of 29-30 h. In contrast to the alpha-phase, the plasma concentrations during the terminal elimination phase were not affected by food. A relationship between ACE inhibition and plasma concentration was not observed. The average ACE inhibition over 72 h was 71 % in the fasting state and 74% in the postprandial state. ACE inhibition increased to about 80% after 24 h and decreased to about 60% at 72 h. The S-shaped concentration-effect curve indicated that a moexiprilat level of 1.3 ng/ml was sufficient to produce 50% inhibition of ACE. With repeated dosing there were no signs of drug accumulation and day-to-day drug levels were relatively constant. The trough concentrations at 24 h did not fall below the limit of 1-2 ng/ml, i.e. a 50% ACE inhibition.", 
    "739": "Moexiprilat showed an extended duration of action owing to a long terminal pharmacokinetic half-life and produced a persistent ACE inhibition. Although the pharmacokinetics were partly influenced by food intake, ACE inhibition was not affected. This might be explained by a second compartment directly related to the ACE which is less prone to food effects and the reaching of a ceiling in the sigmoidal concentration-effect curve even with the lower Cmax concentrations associated with the postprandial state.",

    "745": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II) is an endothelial luminal ectoenzyme. The majority of ACE has been found on the pulmonary capillary endothelium (PCE). Pulmonary capillary endothelium-bound (PCEB)-ACE has been extensively studied by means of indicator dilution techniques in animals and man. We have recently developed and applied methodologies for assaying pulmonary capillary endothelium-bound (PCEB) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in man. This article provides a summary of our studies in human subjects utilizing similar methodology. Trace amounts of the specific ACE substrate, (3)H-benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro ((3)H-BPAP; 40 microCi or 2 nmol), was injected as a bolus into the subclavian vein of patients and immediately blood was withdrawn from a radial arterial catheter. Plasma concentrations of surviving substrate and product ((3)H-benzoyl-Phe) were estimated and BPAP utilization was calculated during a single transpulmonary passage. To investigate the PCE in this manner we tested the hypothesis that PCEB-ACE is depressed in patients diagnosed with acute lung injury and estimated interaction of an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat) with PCE in human subjects. An inverse correlation was found between the pulmonary endothelium-bound ACE activity (v) and the lung injury score (r=0.379; p<0.01). Similarly, an inverse correlation was found between the pulmonary capillary perfusion index (CPI) and the lung injury score (r=0.284, p<0.05). PCEB-ACE activity in the group of patients with mild lung injury was significantly different from the group of control patients (0.44 +/- 0.048 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.05; p<0.01). Trace amounts (1.5 microg/kg) of enalaprilat had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure (91 +/- 6 vs. 84 +/- 7 vs. 88 +/- 6 mmHg for T(1), T(2) and T(3), respectively), but significantly decreased PCEB-ACE activities. When normalized to pre-drug (T(1)) activity levels, enalaprilat inhibited PCEB and SE ACE activity at T(2) by 74 +/- 6 and 68 +/- 6%, respectively. PCEB-ACE measurements can be used in clinical practice for estimating PCE functions and can provide new insight into the physiology of the pulmonary circulation.",

The first method, derivative-differential spectrophotometry, comprised of measurement of the difference absorptivities derivatized in the first-order (DeltaD(1)) of a tablet extract in 0.1 N NaOH relative to that of an equimolar solution in methanol at wavelengths of 227.6 and 276.4 nm, respectively. The second method, depends on the application ratio spectra derivative spectrophotometric method to resolve the interferance due to spectral overlapping. The analytical signals were measured at 237.9, 243.8 nm for fosinopril and 262.4, 269.3 and 278.6 nm for hydrochlorothiazide in the binary mixture, in the first derivative of the ratio spectra of the mixture solutions in methanol.

Angiotensin II and bradykinin regulate cellular proliferation, inflammation, and endothelial function, thus playing an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. A large body of experimental evidence reporting that ACE inhibitors limit these effects has formed the rationale for major clinical trials of these drugs in the management of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The first trial to be completed demonstrated that ACE inhibition improves the prognosis of patients who have, or are at risk of, atherosclerotic vascular disease, independent of its effects on left ventricular function and hypertension. Expanding the indications for ACE inhibitors is now evidence driven, although the choice of agent for these new indications remains to be determined by further research.",

The increased risk of hyperkalemia with renin-angiotensin system blockade was seen in anuric dialysis patients (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3 to 4.2), as well as those with residual renal function (OR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.0 to 4.1).",

This phenomenon has been termed aldosterone \"escape\"; its relation to the severity of the disease is unknown. We sought to assess whether aldosterone escape might be related to disease severity or functional impairment in patients with CHF. One hundred forty-one consecutive patients with CHF who received ACE inhibitors (> 6 months) underwent an evaluation of neurohormonal activation and body composition, an echo-Doppler examination, and a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Aldosterone escape was defined as plasma levels of aldosterone above the normal range in our laboratory (> 0.42 nmol/L). Fourteen patients (10%) had aldosterone escape. There were no differences between patients with and without aldosterone escape with regard to age, New York Heart Association class, neurohormonal activation, ACE inhibitor dose, hemodynamics, or skeletal muscle bulk. In contrast, mean peak oxygen consumption (14.2 +/- 3.5 vs 17.3 +/- 4.9 ml/min/kg, p < 0.05) and the slope of the relation between ventilation and carbon dioxide production (41 +/- 7 vs 36 +/- 6, p <0.05) were significantly worse in patients with aldosterone escape compared with those without it. Thus, aldosterone escape is associated with reduced exercise capacity in patients with CHF. This factor does not seem to be linked with hemodynamic mechanisms or with a reduced skeletal muscle bulk.", 
    "761": "The onset of adverse cardiovascular events demonstrates a circadian pattern that reaches a peak in the morning shortly after awakening and arising. A parallel, 24-hour cyclical pattern has also been observed in the activities of various physiologic measurements, including blood pressure, heart rate, sympathetic nervous system activity, and platelet adhesiveness. Although a direct link has not yet been established, it can be postulated that the early morning surge in blood pressure may be a factor in precipitating acute cardiovascular episodes. Similar to the early morning blood pressure surge, blood pressure variability throughout the day appears to be a further independent risk factor for hypertensive target organ damage. Thus, it is reasonable to select an antihypertensive agent that offers smooth and well-sustained blood pressure control for the full 24-hour dosing interval, including the vulnerable early morning period. The results of clinical trials using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring have shown that telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, possesses such properties. Whether or not these attributes of telmisartan might translate into improvements in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will be explored in the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET). This study will compare the effects of telmisartan 80-mg monotherapy, ramipril 10-mg monotherapy, or a combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg, on cardiovascular endpoints in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events, several of whom are likely to be hypertensive at baseline. Inclusion of the telmisartan plus ramipril treatment arm will allow investigation of the potential advantages presented by combining an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.", 
    "762": "The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study conclusively demonstrated that ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and death in patients at risk for cardiovascular events but without heart failure. The Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound Changes in Patients Treated with Ramipril and Vitamin E (SECURE) substudy demonstrated that ramipril also reduced atherosclerosis. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has a more important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis than previously believed, and they indicate the need for further clinical studies to define the range of benefits available from modifying the RAS. Achieving maximum benefit may require treatment with both an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker (ARB). The Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction (RESOLVD) study indicated that combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB decreased blood pressure and improved the ejection fraction more than treatment with either drug alone in patients with congestive heart failure. The Valsartan in Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) showed that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB reduced hospitalization for heart failure in patients with congestive heart failure by 27.5%, although no decrease in all-cause mortality was observed. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) is a large, long-term study (23,400 patients, 5.5 years). It will compare the benefits of ACE inhibitor treatment, ARB treatment, and treatment with an ACE inhibitor and ARB together, in a study population with established coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes with end-organ damage. Patients with congestive heart failure will be excluded. In a parallel study, patients unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor will be randomized to receive telmisartan or placebo (the Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE-I Intolerant Patients with Cardiovascular Disease [TRANSCEND]). The primary endpoint for both trials is a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary endpoints will investigate reductions in the development of diabetes mellitus, nephropathy, dementia, and atrial fibrillation. These 2 trials are expected to provide new insights into the optimal treatment of patients at high risk of complications from atherosclerosis.", 
    "763": "Proven cardiovascular benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. The first study to show dramatic benefits from ACE inhibition was the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS-I), in which a 31% decrease in the rate of death was observed in patients with severe heart failure at the end of 1 year of enalapril treatment (p = 0.001). This result led to large long-term studies-including Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE), Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE), Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE), and Study of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD)-which verified that ACE inhibition decreases heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI), and mortality, and that striking benefit could be observed within 30 days. Short-term studies of patients in the acute phase of a heart attack verified that ACE inhibition provided rapid benefits. A meta-analysis of short-term (up to 8 weeks) studies of ACE inhibition (including CONSENSUS-II, Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico [GISSI]-3, International Study of Infarct Survival [ISIS]-4, and the Chinese Captopril Study [CCS]-1) demonstrated that post-MI risk was reduced by 10% within the first day of treatment. The immediacy of the benefit suggested that ACE inhibition not only improved cardiovascular function in failing hearts but also affected important mechanisms in patients without overt heart failure. Effects on more general mechanisms of heart disease suggested that patients with problems other than hypertension or heart failure might benefit from ACE inhibitors. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study investigated the hypothesis that ACE inhibition would confer benefits to patients who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, but who were without left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. Long-term reductions in MI, stroke, cardiac arrest, and heart failure, as well as improvements in mortality, were observed in this population after treatment with ACE inhibitors. Substudies of the HOPE study revealed that ACE inhibition reduced progression of atherosclerosis and improved myocardial remodeling. Taken together, these studies provide evidence that supports treatment of a broad population of patients at risk for cardiovascular events with ACE inhibitors. The next step is to combine ACE inhibition with other treatments to maximize patient benefit. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) will compare the efficacy of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) with an angiotensin receptor blocker (telmisartan), and determine whether these treatments in combination will further reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease.", 
    "764": "A direct, continuous, and independent relation between blood pressure and the incidence of various cardiovascular events, such as stroke and myocardial infarction, is now well accepted. The increase in risk can be attributed to structural and functional changes in target organs. Central to many of these pathophysiologic processes is the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), specifically, angiotensin II. Binding of angiotensin II to angiotensin II type-1 (AT(1)) receptors produces acute vasoconstriction, leading to an increase in blood pressure. AT(1) receptor activation also contributes independently to chronic disease pathology by promoting vascular growth and proliferation, and endothelial dysfunction. These negative consequences of angiotensin II are partly counteracted by angiotensin II type-2 (AT(2)) receptor stimulation, which has favorable effects on tissue growth and repair processes. Thus, the use of selective AT(1) receptor antagonists in the treatment of hypertension has a 2-fold rationale: (1) selective AT(1) receptor blockade targets the final common pathway for all major detrimental cardiovascular actions of angiotensin II, and (2) circulating angiotensin II levels (which increase during AT(1) receptor antagonist treatment) will be free to act only at unopposed AT(2) receptors, potentially providing additional end-organ protection. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors interrupt the RAS by preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. They also increase plasma levels of bradykinin, which possesses vasodilatory and tissue-protective properties. The combination of an AT(1) receptor antagonist with an ACE inhibitor represents an appealing therapeutic strategy, because it should produce more complete blockade of the RAS, while preserving the beneficial effects mediated by AT(2) receptor stimulation and increased bradykinin levels.", 
    "765": "Studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and an angiotensin II receptor blocker can delay, but cannot reverse, the progression of experimentally induced radiation nephropathy. In an effort to find a method for reversing injury, three agents were tested in a rat model of radiation nephropathy. Pirfenidone (a phenyl-pyridone antifibrotic) and thiaproline (an inhibitor of collagen deposition) were not capable of retarding the development of radiation nephropathy. However, all-trans retinoic acid (an anti-inflammatory agent) exacerbated radiation nephropathy. We speculated that the detrimental effects of retinoic acid might be the result of stimulation of renal cell proliferation. However, retinoic acid had no effect on tubular or glomerular cell proliferation in normal animals and did not enhance radiation-induced proliferation. A recent report that retinoic acids inhibit nitric oxide production suggested an alternative mechanism, since inhibition of production of nitric oxide is known to exacerbate radiation nephropathy. Experiments demonstrated that retinoic acid exacerbated the radiation-induced drop in renal production of nitric oxide, suggesting that the detrimental effect of all-trans retinoic acid might be explained by inhibition of renal nitric oxide activity. Particularly in view of the recent clinical report of enhancement of radiation nephropathy by retinoic acid in patients receiving bone marrow transplantation, the combination of retinoic acid and renal irradiation should be carried out with great caution.", 
    "766": "Hypocalcemic toxicity accounts for the most common adverse effects of therapeutic plasma exchange. The symptoms can be related to a fall in plasma ionized calcium. Citrate-based anticoagulants, notably sodium citrate and ACD formula A, have been indicated as the major cause of hypocalcemic toxicity, but colloid replacement fluids containing human serum albumin are also at fault. Recognition of the signs and symptoms of hypocalcemic toxicity is important because several clinical measures are available to deal with them and to ensure patient comfort. A typical reactions, characterized by flushing and hypotension during plasma exchange, have been attributed to the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Both exchange and adsorption apheresis procedures can result in atypical reactions in patients who have been taking this class of drugs within 48 to 72 hours of an apheresis procedure. These reactions are less common than hypocalcemic toxicity, but can be prevented by paying attention to detail.",

    "782": "All elements of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are present in the forebrain, particularly in circumventricular organs surrounding the third cerebral ventricle. We tested the hypothesis that forebrain angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has a tonic excitatory influence on sympathetic drive. Neurally intact and sinoaortic-denervated pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were treated with forebrain-directed intracarotid artery (ICA) versus intravenous injections of angiotensin I (ANG I) and of the ACE inhibitor captopril. In intact rats, ICA ANG I elicited a rise in arterial pressure and a concomitant reduction in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA; ICA captopril elicited the opposite responses). In barodenervated rats, ICA ANG I increased and ICA captopril decreased arterial pressure and RSNA in parallel; intravenous ANG I had no effect on RSNA. The findings suggest that the intrinsic forebrain RAS has a tonic excitatory influence on sympathetic drive that is overshadowed in normal rats by baroreflex mechanisms, but may assume a more prominent role in pathophysiological states (e.g., heart failure) in which baroreflex mechanisms are impaired and RAS activity is augmented.", 
    "783": "Clinical and animal studies have shown that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists slows the progression of nephropathy in diabetes, indicating that Ang II plays an important role in its development. We have reported previously that insulin inhibits the stimulatory effect of high glucose levels on angiotensinogen (ANG) gene expression in rat immortalized renal proximal tubular cells (IRPTCs) via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44/42 MAPK) signal transduction pathway. We hypothesize that the suppressive action of insulin on ANG gene expression might be attenuated in renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) of rats with established diabetes. Two groups of male adult Wistar rats were studied: controls and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-STZ administration. Kidney proximal tubules were isolated and cultured in either normal glucose (i.e. 5 mM) or high glucose (i.e. 25 mM) medium to determine the inhibitory effect of insulin on ANG gene expression. Immunoreactive rat ANG (IR-rANG) in culture media and cellular ANG mRNA were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay respectively. Activation of the p44/42 MAPK signal transduction pathway in rat RPTCs was evaluated by p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation employing a PhosphoPlus p44/42 MAPK antibody kit. Insulin (10(-7) M) inhibited the stimulatory effect of high glucose levels on IR-rANG secretion and ANG gene expression and increased p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation in normal rat RPTCs. In contrast, it failed to affect these parameters in diabetic rat RPTCs. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that hyperglycaemia induces insulin resistance on ANG gene expression in diabetic rat RPTCs by altering the MAPK signal transduction pathway.", 
    "784": "This study was performed in order to assess the potentially different effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist irbesartan on the metabolic syndrome in an animal model. Male NZO/BL6 F1 mice were treated with captopril, irbesartan, or placebo for 10 months: Control animals treated with placebo developed a metabolic syndrome with obesity (55.5+/-6.3 g), hypertension (146+/-10 mm Hg), hyperinsulinemia (7.2+/-5.7 ng/ml), hypercholesterolemia (5.1+/-0.7 mmol/l), cardiac hypertrophy (269+/-44 mg) and atherosclerotic plaques in the ascending aorta (3.6+/-1.5 microm(2)). Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist significantly (p<0.001) reduces hypertension (73+/-5 and 78+/-11 mm Hg), cardiac hypertrophy (203+/-26 and 202+/-18 mg) and atherosclerosis (2.2+/-0.9 and 1.8+/-0.8 microm(2)). In addition, they prevented the development of obesity (42.2+/-3.5 and 38.3+/-2.8 g) and hyperinsulinemia (3.6+/-1.5 and 1.8+/-0.4 ng/ml). In conclusion, long-term treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist can ameliorate obesity and hyperinsulinemia in a genetically determined mouse model.",

The ABPM criterion for BP control, independent of clinic values, was achievement of a daytime BP < 130/85 mm Hg after 12 weeks of treatment; patients achieving a reduction in 24-hour DBP > or = 5 mm Hg at 12 weeks were considered responders, in dependent of clinic values.",

BP reductions were similar in the 2 groups, both as measured in the clinic (DBP, 12.7 +/- 8.8 mm Hg irbesartan vs 12.4 +/- 7.4 mm Hg enalapril; SBP, 19.0 +/- 14.1 mm Hg vs 17.5 +/- 14.0 mm Hg) and by 24-hour ABPM (DBP, 9.4 +/- 8.5 mm Hg vs 8.8 +/- 8.5 mm Hg: SBP, 14.7 +/- 14.7 mm Hg vs 12.6 +/- 13.1 mm Hg). As assessed by ABPM, rates of BP control were 40.5% (45/111) for irbesartan and 33.9% (39/115) for enalapril, and the response rates were a respective 71.2% (79/111) and 71.3% (82/115). The overall incidence of adverse events (40.0% irbesartan, 51.2% enalapril) was not statistically different between groups, although the incidence of adverse events considered probably related to antihypertensive treatment was significantly higher with enalapril than with irbesartan (24.6% vs 9.2%, respectively; P = 0.026), essentially because of the higher incidence of cough (8.1% vs 0.9%).",

Therefore, we determined the effects of renal denervation and the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist metoprolol (50 mg/kg body wt po, twice a day) on renocortical expression of renin, COX-2, and nNOS in rats fed a low-salt (0.02% wt/wt) diet or treated for 1 wk with ramipril (10 mg/kg body wt) in combination with a low-salt diet. We found that a low-salt diet in combination with ramipril strongly increased renocortical mRNA levels of renin, COX-2, and nNOS 9-, 7-, and 2.5-fold, respectively. Treatment with metoprolol did not change basal expression of the three genes or induction of renin and COX-2 gene expression, while induction of nNOS expression was clearly attenuated. Similarly, unilateral renal denervation attenuated induction of nNOS expression but had no effect on all other parameters. These findings suggest that beta-adrenergic stimulation is not required for stimulation of renin and COX-2 gene expression in the juxtaglomerular apparatus during salt deficiency. However, beta-adrenoreceptor activity or renal nerve activity appears to be required for the full stimulation of nNOS expression by low salt intake or combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "794": "Captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors widely prescribed for hypertension and heart failure. Cutaneous side effects of captopril include angio-edema, anaphylactoid reactions, maculopapular eruptions, pitiryasis rosea-like rash, toxic erythema, and exfoliative dermatitis. Some of the immunological captopril-induced cutaneous adverse reactions have been diagnosed in recent years by patch tests. A case of a cutaneous immune adverse reaction to captopril with tolerance to enalapril and lisinopril demonstrated both by patch tests and double-blind challenge tests is reported for the first time. A 71-year-old nonatopic woman suffered a generalized pruriginous maculopapular rash. Two months earlier, she had started oral treatment with captopril 50 mg t.i.d and glibenclamide 5 mg daily. After the rash appeared, she stopped both drugs and the reaction cleared. A skin biopsy from one of the lesions showed perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate of the upper dermis. Skin prick tests with captopril and glibenclamide and patch tests with enalapril, lisinopril, and glibenclamide at 1% and 10% pet., and with mercaptobenzothiazole (a sulfhydryl group-containing chemical at 1% pet were negative. Only patch tests with captopril at 1% and 10% concentrations were positive at 48 h. Oral double-blind challenge tests with glibenclamide, enalapril, lisinopril, and placebo showed good tolerance. The patient was advised to avoid only captopril. Because captopril is the only ACE inhibitor containing a sulfhydryl group and has occasionally been implicated in complex immunological diseases, this chemical group has been considered the culprit of allergic reactions to captopril. The lack of cross-reactivity between captopril, enalapril, and benazepril has been demonstrated in a few patients by patch tests. In our patient, patch tests identified captopril as the drug responsible for a probably immune adverse reaction not due to the sulfhydryl group. Patch tests are useful and safe in the diagnostic work-up of allergic drug reactions and in studies of cross-sensitivity among ACE inhibitors.",

It has been shown that nitric oxide (NO) and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are closely related, and both systems regulate apoptotic cell death. However, the effects of NO modulation on myocardial apoptotic cell death and changes in the RAS in the I/R-injured myocardium have not been studied. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: NO synthesis inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME, 10mg/kg); NO precursor, L-arginine (540mg/kg); and vehicle. The rats were then subjected to 45 min coronary occlusion followed by 4 h reperfusion. The TdT-mediated in situ nick and labeling (TUNEL) indices were 39.9%+/-0.8% at the border and 30.9%+/-1.2% at the center of the I/R area in the vehicle group. L-NAME administration significantly increased these TUNEL-positive cells to 45.3%+/-1.9% and 37.9%+/-1.3%, respectively (P < 0.05 each). L-arginine administration reduced the TUNEL index at the border zone with marginal significance (P = 0.08 vs vehicle group). I/R injury significantly reduced the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA expression in the left (ventricular) free wall of vehicle group rats. However, ACE mRNA expression was 1.9 times greater in the L-NAME group than that in the vehicle group (P < 0.05). This study showed that the inhibition of NO synthesis increased apoptotic cardiomyocyte death and local ACE mRNA expression in the I/R-injured myocardium. Our observations indicate that NO, ACE, and apoptotic cardiomyocyte death are related to each other during I/R injury.",

We evaluated the contribution of endogenous bradykinin to tumor-associated angiogenesis and tumor growth using pharmacological approaches in mice bearing sarcoma 180 cells. The weight of implanted tumors increased in parallel with increased hemoglobin contents (a parameter to evaluate angiogenesis) over a 20-day experimental period. Daily administration of bradykinin B2-receptor antagonists, Hoe140 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg per day, local injection) or FR173657 (30 mg/kg per day, p.o.), significantly suppressed the increment in angiogenesis and tumor weight, but a B1-receptor antagonist, desArg10-Hoe140 (1 mg/kgperday), did not. Administration of a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, soybean trypsin inhibitor (3 mg/site per day), significantly suppressed angiogenesis and tumor growth. In contrast, bradykinin-degrading enzyme inhibitors, captopril and phosphoramidon (500 microg/site per day), enhanced angiogenesis and increased tumor weight. Our results suggest that bradykinin, produced by plasma kallikrein or plasma kallikrein-like enzymes, promote tumor-associated angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo.",

During each season of the year 622 cardiologists recruited the first 5 cardiac insufficiency patients who had been stable for at least three months. 8618 observations were analysed. The results showed 68% are male with an average age of 70 years, with an ischaemic aetiology in 47% of cases, hypertensive in 23%, and in NYHA stage II or III in 94% of cases.

Medical treatment includes diuretics in 78% of cases, with 28% of patients on spironolactone, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) in 82% of cases, betablockers in 29% of cases; ACE inhibitors and betablockers are clearly prescribed more often than during the previous 1994 survey but at doses often lower than the recommendations. Lastly, there are no seasonal variations in prescriptions.", 
    "806": "Angiotensin II is the effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system and is involved in a wide range of physiologic functions that relate to volume control. In this regard, angiotensin II maintains and regulates salt and water balance, is critically involved in cardiovascular function, and governs thirst. When present in excess, angiotensin II can pathologically influence each of these functions. The role of angiotensin II in controlling sodium balance, in both renal insufficiency states and congestive heart failure, is clearly recognized. Alternatively, it is poorly appreciated that angiotensin II plays an important role in both normal and pathologic thirst states. The latter is a potential problem in both end-stage renal disease and congestive heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists (AT1-RAs) have both been shown to reduce abnormal thirst drive. Whether an ACE inhibitor or an AT1-RA lessens thirst drive to any significant degree relates to its capacity to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and AT1-RAs, as to their effect on thirst drive, have not been undertaken in a systematic fashion; thus, until otherwise established, the effect of these compounds on thirst should be viewed as a class effect, albeit one that is likely to be dose-dependent.

Although the experimental evidence in support of their use in CHF is incontrovertible, their pattern of usage has failed to keep pace with the research findings. One factor that has fueled the hesitancy to use ACE inhibitors in CHF has been the concern that renal function might worsen upon their receipt. Although the glomerular filtration rate may decline when ACE inhibitor or angiotension receptor blocker therapy is started in CHF, in most cases it is not a reason to discontinue therapy other than temporarily. Although ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may differ theoretically in their renal effects, published information to date has not shown such a difference. (c)2001 by CHF, Inc.",

    "809": "Hyperkalemia is not an uncommon occurrence in the congestive heart failure patient, particularly when renal failure coexists. Hyperkalemia in CHF is typically medication-related. Its occurrence is inevitably linked to the simultaneous ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, and more recently, aldosterone receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone. The most devastating consequence of hyperkalemia is its cardiotoxicity that can be fairly insidious in its rate of development. The therapy of hyperkalemia in congestive heart failure can involve both acute and semiacute management phases. Acute hyperkalemia management includes measures that block the adverse membrane effects of hyperkalemia, such as intravenous calcium administration, and efforts to shift potassium intracellularly, such as occurs with intravenous bicarbonate and/or inhaled beta-agonists. Semiacute management of hyperkalemia includes measures to increase urinary potassium excretion and administration of binding resins, such as Kayexalate\u00ae. Prevention is the cornerstone of hyperkalemia management in the heart failure patient and requires that careful attention be directed to both identifying exogenous sources of potassium and pinpointing the maximum tolerable dose of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker.

    "810": "Our objective was to assess whether serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity during routine clinical practice accurately reflects patient adherence to ACE inhibitor treatment in chronic heart failure (CHF). During 1994-95, ACE was measured in 73 CHF patients who were routinely attending the heart failure clinic at Ninewells Hospital. At the same time, the Medicines Monitoring Unit collected data on whether and when prescriptions for ACE inhibitors were redeemed at community pharmacies, which enabled each patient's adherence over a prolonged period to be assessed. We then correlated whether an elevation in serum ACE was associated with poor adherence with ACE inhibitor treatment. In total, 18% of CHF patients appeared to exhibit less than 70% adherence with their ACE inhibitor treatment, with 34% exhibiting less than 85%adherence and 58% exhibiting less than 100% adherence. A serum ACE activity of more than 12 U/L gave 91% positive predictive accuracy that the patient was less than 100% adherent with his or her ACE inhibitor treatment. At the other extreme, a serum ACE less than 6.5 U/L gave 81% positive predictive accuracy that the patient was more than 85% adherent with ACE inhibitor treatment. Nonadherence with ACE inhibitor treatment, therefore, was found to be common in patients with CHF. The simple, inexpensive test of serum ACE activity can be used in CHF patients to identify many, although not all, nonadherent patients so that adherence-enhancing strategies can be targeted toward them. Further work is clearly required to explore the precise clinical utility of this promising test. (c)2001 by CHF, Inc.", 
    "811": "Omapatrilat (OMA), a vasopeptidase inhibitor, simultaneously inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase, which degrades vasodilatory factors (eg, ADM) and natriuretic peptides. Based on the beneficial cardiorenal and humoral properties of the natriuretic peptides, we hypothesized that an acute vasopeptidase inhibitor with or without diuretic would result in more favorable cardiorenal and hormonal actions than ACE inhibition plus diuretic (ACEI+D) in congestive heart failure.", 
    "812": "We compared the actions of OMA alone and with diuretic (OMA+D) to ACEI+D in a model of pacing-induced congestive heart failure. OMA+D decreased pulmonary arterial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures to a greater level than OMA alone or ACEI+D. Glomerular filtration rate was lower with ACEI+D than with either OMA group. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone immediately increased with ACEI+D, whereas OMA+D resulted in higher plasma renin activity and a delayed increase in aldosterone. OMA alone did not increase plasma renin activity and aldosterone, but resulted in a sustained increase in plasma adrenomedullin, with higher urinary atrial natriuretic peptide, adrenomedullin, and cGMP excretions than with ACEI+D.", 
    "813": "Acute administration of OMA with or without diuretic results in more favorable cardiorenal and humoral responses in experimental congestive heart failure than does ACEI+D. There is no acute activation of renin and aldosterone with OMA alone such as occurs with ACEI+D and OMA+D. Thus, OMA with or without a diuretic possesses beneficial cardiorenal and humoral actions comparable to those observed with ACEI+D that can be explained by potentiation of natriuretic peptides.",

Chronic ACE inhibition induced both renal and vascular B(1)-receptor expression, whereas B(2)-receptor expression was not modified. Furthermore, with B(1)-receptor antagonists, it was shown that B(1)-receptor induction was involved in the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibition. Using microdissection, we prepared 10 different nephron segments and found ACE-inhibitor-induced expression of functional B(1)-receptors in all segments. ACE-inhibitor-induced B(1)-receptor induction involved homologous upregulation, because it was prevented by B(1)-receptor antagonist treatment. Finally, using B(2)-receptor knockout mice, we showed that ACE-inhibitor-induced B(1)-receptor expression was B(2)-receptor independent.",

In the present study, we have applied recently developed methodologies for assaying pulmonary capillary endothelium-bound (PCEB) ACE activity in man, to estimate the interaction of an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat) with PCEB ACE in human subjects. Trace amounts of the specific ACE substrate, 3H-benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro (3H-BPAP; 40 Ci or 2 nmol), was injected as a bolus into the subclavian vein and immediately blood was withdrawn from a radial arterial catheter. Plasma concentrations of surviving substrate and product (3H-benzoyl-Phe) were estimated and BPAP utilization was calculated during a single transpulmonary passage, at baseline (T(0)) and at 15 min (T(15)) and 2 h (T(120)) after intravenous administration of 1.5 g/kg enalaprilat in 12 normotensive subjects. This treatment had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure (91+/- 6 vs. 84 +/- 7 vs. 88 +/- 6 mm Hg for T(0), T(15) and T(120), respectively), but significantly decreased serum and PCEB ACE activities. When normalized to predrug (T(0)) activity levels, enalaprilat inhibited PCEB and serum ACE activities at T(15) 74 +/- 6% and 68 +/- 6%, respectively. However, 2 h after enalaprilat (T(120)), PCEB ACE inhibition was maintained at 66 +/- 7%, whereas serum ACE inhibition was reduced to 46 +/- 8% (P<.01 from PCEB ACE), suggesting a preferential PCEB ACE inhibitory effect of enalaprilat.", 
    "818": "Plaque disruption with superimposed thrombosis is the main cause of acute coronary events such as acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Among other factors, tissue factor seems to play an important role determining plaque thrombogenicity. Tissue factor is a potent initiator of the coagulation cascade situated within the vessel wall and is highly exposed to the blood after plaque rupture. Several mediators involved in the process of atherosclerotic plaque formation are capable of inducing tissue factor expression in cells such as monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells, which under normal conditions do not express tissue factor or to a limited extent only. The increased expression of tissue factor is not limited to the plaque but is also found in circulating monocytes in patients with acute coronary syndromes. In addition, studies have shown an important contribution of tissue factor in the pathogenesis of thrombosis and restenosis after balloon angioplasty. Recent basic studies focus on the therapeutic inhibition of tissue factor. Specific and non-specific inhibitors of tissue factor or the tissue factor/factor VIIa complex have been developed or identified, and have been tested in experimental studies. Clinical studies are currently being initiated. In this review, we present the current knowledge on the role of tissue factor in atherosclerosis, arterial intervention and potential pharmacological approaches, with focus on acute coronary syndromes.",

Chronic therapy with vasodilators has been shown to reduce left ventricular wall stress, and thereby delay or obviate the need for valve replacement in aortic regurgitation; however, no data are currently available in patients with chronic MR using standard vasodilators or agents that block renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components. Studies in a clinically relevant dog model of experimentally induced MR demonstrate upregulation of the cardiac RAS.

It is increasingly appreciated that the elusive goal of a 'normal' BP is achieved only if multi-drug therapy is employed. This is especially so when considered in the context of today's lower BP goals. The options for multi-drug therapy are quite simple: either fixed-dose combination therapy or drugs added sequentially one after another to then arrive at an effective multi-drug regimen. Advocates exist for both approaches. A considerable legacy, dating to the 1950's, exists for fixed-dose combination therapies. The rationale to this approach has remained constant. Fixed-dose combination therapy successfully reduces BP because two drugs, each typically working at a separate site, block different effector pathways. In addition, the second drug of such two-drug combinations may check counter-regulatory system activity triggered by the other. For example, a diuretic and beta-blocker combination may find the diuretic correcting the salt-and-water retention which occasionally accompanies beta-blocker therapy. The pattern of adverse effects also differs with fixed-dose combination therapy, in part, because less drug is generally being given. In addition, one component of a fixed-dose combination therapy can effectively counterbalance the tendency of the other to produce adverse effects. For example, the peripheral oedema, that accompanies calcium channel antagonist therapy, occurs less frequently when an ACE inhibitor is co-administered. ACE inhibitors improve, if not eliminate, the peripheral oedema associated with calcium channel antagonists because of their proven ability to cause venodilation. In addition, diuretic therapy-induced volume contraction may generate a state of secondary hyperaldosteronism and thereby electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia and/or hypomagnesaemia. In many cases, the co-administration of either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker with a diuretic corrects the aforementioned electrolyte disturbances. Fixed-dose combination therapy has a proven record of reducing BP. This form of treatment has been available for close to a half-century. Over that period of time, many physicians have taken advantage of this therapeutic approach even when academic opinion was less than charitable to this concept. Academic opinion is rarely immutable and occasionally irrelevant to prescription practice. Prescription practice is driven by many considerations including ease of use, cost and tolerance of a therapy. Most importantly, the therapeutic pathway taken should successfully result in goal BP being reached in a large number of those treated. Unfortunately, despite the simplicity of the concept behind fixed-dose combination therapy, its success will ultimately rest on cost. If made truly cost-competitive, it will gain an increasing share of the hypertensive market. If not, market forces will relegate it to a secondary role for hypertension treatment.", 
    "821": "The standard of hypertension control in the population is not satisfactory, only 20% patients with hypertension achieve target values of blood pressure (BP). Extensive prospective studies revealed that diuretics, beta-blockers as well as the majority of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the incidence of complications of hypertension and are therefore considered drugs of first choice in the treatment of hypertension. The additive effects of ACE inhibitors are manifested in particular after larger doses. OBJECTIVE OF TRIAL: To assess the effectiveness and tolerance of the modern long-acting ACE inhibitor--fosinopril--in the treatment of mild and medium severe hypertension and its effect on some anthropometric and laboratory parameters.", 
    "822": "Fosinopril as monotherapy in amounts of 10, 20 and 40 mg led to normalization of BP in 85% of the group (n = 203) and was very well tolerated. Only 11% of the group needed a combination with hydrochlorothiazide--12.5 g/day--after which normal BP levels were attained. Only 4% of the patients did not complete the study on account of undesirable effects, incl. 3 patients where cough was the reason for discontinuation. After 12 weeks treatment the systolic BP was reduced on average by 31 mm Hg and the diastolic BP by 16 mm Hg. The heart rate (HR) declined on average by 3 beats/min. (p 0.001). After four weeks treatment a significant decline of the blood sugar level occurred which was even more marked after 12 weeks of treatment (on average by 0.27 mmol/l and at the same time a significant drop of sodium occurred (by 2 mmol/l), of total and LDL-cholesterol (by 0.26 and 0.23 mmol/l). An expected increase of the potassium level occurred (by 0.1 mmol/l) and creatinine (by 3.4 mumol/l in plasma).", 
    "823": "Fosinopril treatment with 10-40 mg/day was effective in monotherapy of hypertension in 85% patients and was well tolerated. After 12 weeks treatment a significant decline of the BP, HR occurred as well as the expected decline of the plasma Na/K ratio and improvement of some metabolic parameters.", 
    "824": "Nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen free-radicals play an important part in the destruction of beta-cells in auto- immune diabetes although the precise mechanism of interaction is still not known. This study was designed to examine any possible diabetogenic effect of NO by investigating any differences in cellular binding of insulin to its receptor on the cell membranes of erythrocytes and mononuclear leucocytes of dogs treated with the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and controls treated with captopril.", 
    "825": "The result obtained showed decreased binding of insulin to its receptor on the cell membranes of erythrocytes and mononuclear leucocytes. Mononuclear leucocytes from SNAP-treated dogs had decreased ability to bind insulin (16.30 +/- 1.24 %) when compared to mononuclear leucocytes from captopril-treated controls (20.30 +/- 1.93 %). Similar results were obtained for erythrocytes from dogs treated with SNAP (27.20 +/- 1.33 %) compared with dogs treated with captopril (34.70 +/- 3.58 %). Scatchard analysis demonstrated that this decrease in insulin binding was accounted for by a decrease in insulin receptor sites per cell, with mononuclear leucocytes of SNAP-treated dogs having 55 % less insulin receptor sites per cell compared with those of captopril-treated controls (P < 0.05). Average affinity and kinetic analysis revealed a 35 % decrease in the average receptor affinity, with mononuclear leucocytes from captopril-treated controls having an empty site affinity of 12.36 +/- 1.12 x 10(-8) M(-1) compared with 9.64 +/- 0.11 x 10(-8) M(-1) in SNAP-treated dogs (P < 0.05).", 
    "826": "These results suggest that acute alteration of the insulin receptor on the membranes of mononuclear leucocytes and erythrocytes occurred in dogs treated with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. These findings suggest the first evidence of the novel role of NO as a modulator of insulin binding and the involvement of NO in the aetiology of diabetes mellitus.", 
    "827": "The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently published guidelines on prophylaxis for patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction (MI). Based on a previously commissioned extensive review of the literature, the recommendations are antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) for all patients; statins for those with hypercholesterolaemia; spironolactone for those with moderate-to-severe heart failure (HF); and insulin for those with diabetes. While there may be concerns about some of the details (eg., the possible adverse interaction between aspirin and ACEIs), comments on the use of statins for those with HF, the lack of advice on the choice of lipid-lowering therapy for those intolerent of statins, the dangers of spironolactone therapy and the practicality of intensive insulin treatment, the guidelines are firmly based on sound evidence of efficacy and cost effectiveness. The NICE guidelines should therefore stimulate the provision of resources to address the gap between current practice and these recommendations.", 
    "828": "The rising incidence of stroke, congestive heart failure (CHF) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) has signalled a need to increase awareness, treatment and control of hypertension. There continues to be a need for effective antihypertensive medications since hypertension is a major precursor to various forms of cardiovascular disease. The renin-angiotensin (AT) aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key component to the development of hypertension and can be one target of drug therapy. Angotensin II (ATII) receptor blockers (ARBs) are the most recent class of agents available to treat hypertension, which work by by inhibiting ATII at the receptor level. Currently, national consensus guidelines recommend that ARBs should be reserved for hypertensive patients who cannot tolerate angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs). ARBs, however, are moving to the forefront of therapy with a promising role in the area of renoprotection and CHF. Recent trials such as the The Renoprotective Effect of the Angiotensin-Receptor Antagonist Irbesartan in Patients with Nephropathy Due to Type 2 Diabetes Trial (IDNT), the Effect of Irbesartan on the Development of Diabetic Nephropathy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (IRMA2), and The Effects of Losartan on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy (RENAAL) study have demonstrated the renoprotective effects of ARBs in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) adds to the growing body of evidence that ARBs may improve morbidity and mortality in CHF patients. As a class, ARBs are well tolerated and have a lower incidence of cough and angioedema compared to ACEIs. This article reviews the differences among the ARBs, existing efficacy data in hypertension, and explores the role of ARBs in CHF and renal disease.", 
    "829": "Fibrinolysis is controlled by the plasminogen activator system. The proteolytic activity of this system is mediated by plasmin, which is generated from plasminogen by one of two plasminogen activators. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) inhibits this process. Individuals with reduced fibrinolytic activity are at increased risk for ischemic cardiovascular events, and reduced fibrinolysis may underlie some of the pathological consequences of reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability. Within the vasculature, angiotensin II stimulates the release of PAI-1, thereby reducing fibrinolytic activity. Thus, the plasminogen activator system is largely controlled by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In accordance with this finding, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with substantial reductions in the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events. Links between the RAS, fibrinolytic balance, and cardiovascular pathology are further supported by evidence from transgenic and knockout animal models. This article discusses the role of the plasminogen activator system in cardiovascular pathology, and the potential for alleviating that pathology by manipulation of the RAS.", 
    "830": "Although interruption of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has evolved as the therapy of choice in heart failure based on large-scale morbidity and mortality clinical studies, treatment with angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) offers an alternative and potentially superior method of treating this condition. Early pilot studies were quite promising; however, two well designed, large-scale trials have shown that the reduction in heart failure mortality with ARB is not significantly different from the reduction with ACE inhibitors. Possible reasons for lack of ARB superiority include insufficient dosing of ARB, differences in effects mediated through angiotensin II type 2 receptors, interaction with beta-blockers, and bradykinin-mediated effects specific to ACE inhibitors. The ACE inhibitors remain the current therapy of choice in treating heart failure until further outcomes trial data become available; however, ARB are a reasonable alternative in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "831": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and small reductions in blood pressure can have a substantial impact on outcome. Effective control of hypertension per se is important in reducing morbidity and mortality, but there is growing evidence that the class of drug used in treatment may affect patient outcomes. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial provided evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), are particularly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in a wide range of patients. These beneficial effects of ACEI may be independent of antihypertensive effect. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the newest class of antihypertensive drug to enter clinical use. By blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, ARB achieve more complete blockade of the RAS than ACEI. The ARB also have a substantially better side effect profile than ACEI, and early evidence suggests that ARB are beneficial in combating hypertension-related target organ damage. These favorable characteristics suggest that ARB should be considered as first-line treatment for hypertension. Based on comparative antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan, a new ARB, may represent a significant addition to this drug class.", 
    "832": "The excess morning risk of myocardial infarction and stroke may be attributable to the rapid rise in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in the hours after awakening. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter study was to compare once-daily, controlled-onset, extended-release (COER-24) verapamil to enalapril and losartan on BP and heart rate during the postawakening morning phase as well as throughout the 24-h period.", 
    "833": "A total of 406 patients were randomized to an 8-week forced-titration period with one of the following: 1) COER-24 verapamil 240 mg/day titrated to 360 mg/day; 2) enalapril 10 mg/day titrated to 20 mg/day, 3) losartan 50 mg/day titrated to 100 mg/day, or 4) placebo. Office BP and heart rate and ambulatory 24-h BP monitoring was performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks.", 
    "834": "Each active treatment, as compared with placebo, lowered BP both during the morning hours as well as the entire 24-h period. COER-24 verapamil was more effective in lowering morning systolic (-16.6 mm Hg) and diastolic (-11.9 mm Hg) BP than either enalapril or losartan (P < .001). For the entire 24-h period, the effects of COER-24 verapamil (-11.6/-8.4 mm Hg) were comparable to enalapril (- 13.4/-8.3 mm Hg; P = NS). Losartan achieved a similar 24-h effect on systolic pressure (-9.3 mm Hg) but was less effective on diastolic pressure (-5.4 mm Hg; P = .004 v COER-verapamil). Unlike losartan or enalapril, COER-24 verapamil was the only treatment to lower the heart rate over both the 24-h period (-4.6 beats/min; P < .001) and during waking hours (-4.6 beats/min; P < .001). A blunted rate of rise in BP, heart rate, and rate-pressure product occurred during the postawakening period with COER-verapamil (P = .03) but not with either of the other treatment arms. Lastly, the decline in BP at night was similar for COER-verapamil and losartan and greater with enalapril (P = .014)", 
    "835": "COER-24 verapamil produces changes in BP and pulse that more closely match the normal circadian hemodynamic rhythms than either do enalapril or losartan.", 
    "836": "A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure for the simultaneous determination of quinapril and its active metabolite quinaprilat in human plasma samples is described. A one-step solid-phase extraction (SPE) with C18 cartridges was coupled with a reversed-phase HPLC system. The system requires two mobile phases composed of tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogensulfate (10 mM adjusted to pH 7)-acetonitrile (62:38, v/v) for quinapril, and (25:75, v/v) for quinaprilat elution through a C18 Symmetry column and detection at a wavelength of 215 nm. Calibration curves were linear over the ranges 20 to 1,000 ng/ml for quinaprilat and 10 to 500 for quinapril. The limits of quantification were 20 and 10 ng/ml for quinaprilat and quinapril, respectively. Extraction recoveries were higher than 90% for quinapril and 80% for quinaprilat. This method has been successfully applied to a bioequivalence study of quinapril in healthy subjects.", 
    "837": "Quinapril is an antihypertensive drug commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. In this work, a capillary zone electrophoresis system is optimized for the analysis of quinapril and its active metabolite quinaprilat in urine, as well as for the determination of the drug and its combination with hydrochlorothiazide in pharmaceuticals. The separation takes place in a fused-silica capillary. The running electrolyte consists of a 60 mM borate buffer solution, pH 9.5. The analysis of urine samples requires a previous extraction step using C8 solid-phase cartridges. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the separation of the two analytes and the internal standard takes less than 5 min. The detection limits obtained (75 and 95 ng/mL for quinapril and quinaprilat, respectively) allow the application of the electrophoretic method to the determination of the drug and its metabolite in urine samples obtained from four patients treated with quinapril.", 
    "838": "In order to simulate the in vivo binding behavior of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to the zinc-containing active center of ACE, the in vitro interaction between lisinopril and zinc or nickel ions was investigated in aqueous solutions of different pH by using attenuated total reflection (ATR)/Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy with second-derivative IR spectral analysis. The results indicated that the lisinopril dissociation process occurred in a stepwise fashion during increase in pH. The IR peaks at 1642 cm(-1) (carbonyl stretching of tertiary amide) and at 1582 cm(-1) (asymmetric COO- stretching) for lisinopril in solution at pH 3.5 shifted to 1606 and 1586 cm(-1) after addition of Ni2+ ions, respectively, but there was no marked changes in IR spectra of lisinopril after addition of Zn2+ ions. When the Zn2+ ions were added to lisinopril solution at pH 5.0, the peak at 1642 cm(-1) also shifted to 1604 cm(-1) and the peak at 1582 cm(-1) shifted to 1586 cm(-1), similar to the changes at pH 3.5 after adding Ni2+ ions. However, the peaks at 1582 and 1642 cm(-1) both shifted to 1599 cm(-1) after addition of Ni2+ ions at pH 5.0 or at pH 7.3. The peak at 1576 cm(-1) also shifted to 1599 cm(-1) after addition of Zn2+ ions to lisinopril solution at pH 7.3. Different coordination sites or types (chelating, bridging or pseudounidentate complex) between lisinopril and Zn2+ or Ni2+ ions were proposed, based on the separation value between v(as) (COO-) and v(s) (COO-), and the shifting of carbonyl groups. Coordination of the secondary amine in lisinopril to metal ions was also evidenced."
