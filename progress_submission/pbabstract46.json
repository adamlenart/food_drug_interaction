The B2 receptor (B2-R) mediating most of the inflammatory and cardiovascular effects of bradykinin represents a candidate gene likely involved in the complex genetic causes of common chronic disorders such as hypertension. The C181T polymorphism of the B2-R gene influences the potency of bradykinin and there is evidence of a possible role of this polymorphism in the development of hypertension and end-stage renal disease. We developed and validated a new, rapid, and reliable method for the detection of the C181T polymorphism based on the hybridization probes format on the LightCycler, which is superior to the conventional PCR-RFLP method commonly used to detect this polymorphism. It allows the solid evaluation of large patient populations with the best time.", 
    "1": "The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) along with good blood pressure control have been shown to significantly decrease the level of proteinuria and slow the progression of renal insufficiency in patients with nondiabetic glomerular disease including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Thus, this should be part of the therapeutic approach for all proteinuric patients with FSGS and should be considered the mainstay of therapy for patients with FSGS secondary to conditions associated with hyperfiltration and/or reduced nephron mass and those patients with nonnephrotic primary FSGS. However, nephrotic patients with primary FSGS may continue to have marked proteinuria and progression of renal disease despite these measures and thus require a more aggressive approach with the use of steroids and immunosuppressive agents. Although primary FSGS was once thought to be a steroid-nonresponsive lesion, recent experience has provided a note of optimism in the use of steroids and immunosuppressive agents in treating this otherwise progressive glomerulopathy. As a result, a course of steroid therapy in primary FSGS is now warranted in nephrotic patients with reasonably well preserved renal function in whom it is not otherwise contraindicated.", 
    "2": "Collapsing glomerulopathy is a morphologic variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) characterized by segmental and global collapse of the glomerular capillaries, marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia of podocytes, and severe tubulointerstitial disease. The cause of this disorder is unknown, but nearly identical pathologic findings are present in idiopathic collapsing glomerulopathy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated nephropathy, and collapsing glomerulopathy has been associated with parvovirus B19 infection and treatment with pamidronate. The pathogenesis of collapsing glomerulopathy involves visceral epithelial cell injury leading to cell cycle dysregulation and a proliferative phenotype. Clinically, collapsing glomerulopathy is characterized by black racial predominance, a high incidence of nephrotic syndrome, and rapidly progressive renal failure. Collapsing glomerulopathy also may recur after renal transplantation or present de novo, often leading to loss of the allograft. The optimal treatment for collapsing glomerulopathy is unknown. Treatments may include steroids or cyclosporine in addition to aggressive blood pressure control, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and lipid lowering agents. The role of other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of collapsing FSGS remains to be defined. Prospective clinical trials are needed to define optimal therapy of this aggressive form of FSGS.",

It is a focal segmental glomerulosclerosis causing rapid deterioration of renal function. It is the most common cause of chronic renal disease in HIV patients and occurs almost exclusively in blacks. Through murine and human studies, it is now clear that HIVAN is caused by a direct effect of infection of renal cells by HIV-1 and that the virus actively replicates within renal cells. How the virus causes disease within cells is not yet understood, but there is evidence for factors within infected cells causing both proliferation and apoptosis. Steroids, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have been used for the treatment of HIVAN, with HAART, in particular, showing a dramatic improvement in both the pathologic changes and clinical course of HIVAN.",

She had been on both medications for more than 2 years. Urinary protein excretion was 2.53 g/day and renal function laboratory data were within the normal range. Plasma aldosterone concentration was high at 248 pg/ml, with normal plasma renin activity. The renal biopsy specimens showed prominent glomerular hypertrophy. Four weeks after the addition of valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker(ARB), urinary protein excretion was remarkably reduced to 0.6 g/day without adversely affecting blood pressure. During the treatment period, proteinuria was maintained at less than 0.6 g/day and renal function remained normal. We propose that glomerular hypertension caused by insufficient suppression of the renin-angiotensin system was an essential factor underlying the increased urinary protein excretion in this patient. Combination therapy of an ARB and an ACE inhibitor appears to have a beneficial effect in patients with IgA nephropathy patients with persistent glomerular hypertension.",

Phorbol esters, such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), are potent activators of conventional and novel PKCs. Addition of PMA increases the rate of glucose uptake in many different cell systems. We attempted to investigate the mechanism via which PMA stimulates glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in more detail. We observed a good correlation between the rate of disappearance of PKCbetaII during prolonged PMA treatment and the increase in glucose uptake. Moreover, inhibition of PKCbetaII with a specific myristoylated PKCbetaC2-4 peptide inhibitor significantly increased the rate of glucose transport. Western blot analysis demonstrated that both PMA treatment and incubation with the myristoylated PKCbetaC2-4 pseudosubstrate resulted in more glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 but not GLUT-4 at the plasma membrane. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that inactivation of PKC, most likely PKCbetaII, elevates glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The observation that PKCbetaII influences the rate of glucose uptake through manipulation of GLUT-1 expression levels at the plasma membrane might reveal a yet unidentified regulatory mechanism involved in glucose homeostasis.",

    "46": "The findings of the recent HOPE trial strongly suggest that ACE inhibitor therapy may reduce risk for type 2 diabetes in patients who are non-diabetic at baseline. This finding is readily rationalized by previous evidence that bradykinin, acting via B2 receptors, can potentiate the insulin responsiveness of both adipocytes and muscle fibers; this effect may be mediated by a reduction in the activity of a tyrosine phosphatase that targets the insulin receptor. ACE inhibitors, in turn, increase the availability of bradykinin by suppressing its proteolytic degradation. In light of the fact that the development of insulin resistance in adipocytes is responsible for the excessive free fatty acid flux that gives rise to the diabetic syndrome, a favorable impact of ACE inhibition on adipocyte insulin responsiveness - complemented by a potentiation of the direct action of bradykinin on skeletal muscle - offers a satisfying explanation for the prevention of diabetes observed during ACE inhibitor therapy. Since the population at risk for diabetes is huge and increasing dramatically, the recent development of orally absorbable food-derived peptides with clinically significant ACE inhibitory activity - such as 'Katsuobushi oligopeptides' derived from bonito - may make it more logistically feasible to achieve this protection on a widescale basis, while simultaneously promoting blood pressure control and reducing risk for atherothrombotic disease.",

The potential value of these drugs when hypertensive patients suffer an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has, however, not been fully elucidated. The objective of the present observational study was to investigate whether prior use of different antihypertensive drugs could modify or influence in-hospital death in hypertensives suffering an AMI. A total of 299 hypertensive patients with the diagnosis of AMI were included. The demographic data were obtained from medical records. Variables were entered into a logistic regression model. The main predictors of death were age (adjusted odds ratio (ORa) 1.07, p = 0.002 (per each year), and the use of diuretics (ORa 2.54, p = 0.018) and calcium blockers (ORa 2.54, p = 0.010). On the other hand, the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a marked reduction of in-hospital death (ORa 0.44, p = 0.045). The present study indicates that while the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital death in hypertensive patients suffering an AMI, the use of diuretics and calcium blockers was associated with increased risks.",

On the basis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, diuretics make clinical and economic sense as initial therapy for those with hypertension. Calcium antagonists are well tolerated and effective and should be considered as the initial drug therapy when diuretics are not tolerated or when multiple drug therapy is indicated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be used in people with nephropathy, and, in these patients, will nearly always need to be part of multiple drug therapy to achieve blood pressure control. When blood pressure control can be achieved in largely non-nephropathic populations, there is further evidence that the drug class used as initial therapy may not be important. One of the main themes coming from the literature in the last year is that renal function is increasingly being recognized as an important outcome measure and marker of cardiovascular risk.", 
    "59": "The focus in blood pressure management must now be on identifying those with hypertension and bringing their blood pressure to target. For the majority of those with hypertension and renal disease, multiple drug therapy will be required, and, to achieve blood pressure targets, calcium antagonists are an appropriate part of this regimen. Particular attention is needed for nephropathic patients because of their higher risk of progression and the need for combination therapy; this group is likely to be the focus of future research and publications.", 
    "60": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals cardiac signal intensity changes in patients with acute myocarditis; however, the natural history of these changes and their relationship to individual outcomes are unknown. The relationship of MRI findings to long-term outcome was studied by serial MRI studies in 16 patients with acute myocarditis who were followed for 30+/-4 (SE) months. Myocardial contrast enhancement was monitored using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted fast spin-echo images. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured with gradient-echo sequences. Clinical symptoms were scored. The results were compared to a control group of 26 age-matched, healthy volunteers. Myocardial contrast enhancement, which was markedly increased in the early course of the disease, decreased at 4 weeks and remained within the normal range in most patients after 30 months. Contrast enhancement 4 weeks after onset of symptoms was predictive for the functional and clinical long-term outcome.Contrast-enhanced MRI may be a useful, noninvasive tool for longterm follow-up of patients with acute myocarditis. Furthermore, relatively early MRI findings may predict longer-term outcomes.", 
    "61": "Even though cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with CRF and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), ill-conceived notions have led to therapeutic nihilism as the predominant strategy in the management of cardiovascular disease in these populations. The recent data clearly support the application of proven interventions in the general population, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins to patients with CRF and ESRD. The advances in coronary stents and intracoronary irradiation have decreased the restenosis rates in renal failure patients. Coronary artery bypass with internal mammary graft might be the procedure of choice for coronary revascularization in these patients. The role of screening for asymptomatic coronary disease is established as a pretransplant procedure, but it is unclear whether this will be applicable to all patients with ESRD. Future studies need to focus on unraveling the mechanisms by which uremia leads to increased cardiovascular events to design optimal therapies targeted toward these mechanisms and improve cardiovascular outcomes.", 
    "62": "Hypertension (HTN) contributes to the high incidence of cardiovascular disease mortality as well as chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) and late graft failure in renal transplant recipients. The mechanisms are complex and may involve pathogenic factors attributable to the host, allograft, and immunosuppressive drugs. Calcium channel blockers should be used to ameliorate the nephrotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors in the early years after transplantation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 type-1 receptor blockers are safe and effective, have antiproteinuric effects, slow the progression of CAN, and may provide survival benefits. Diuretics and/or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers are frequently added in combination regimen. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive drugs should also be considered for the long-term care of kidney recipients with HTN.", 
    "63": "CHF is highly prevalent in ESRD and is a leading cause of death in such patients. Hypertension, renal anemia, and comorbid conditions such as coronary artery disease are particularly important risk factors for CHF in ESRD. Dialysis hypotension may be a marker of poor prognosis in such persons. Recent studies suggest that lipid peroxidation and L-carnitine deficiency may contribute to CHF in some patients with ESRD. All forms of renal replacement therapy are capable of ameliorating symptoms of CHF, but their effect on cardiovascular mortality has not been firmly established. Drug therapy, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, is under-used in patients with ESRD and CHF. Heart/kidney transplantation may be a viable option for some patients with advanced CHF and ESRD.", 
    "64": "Both randomized and nonrandomized controlled studies have linked congestive heart failure (CHF) case management (CM) to decreased readmissions and improved outcomes in mostly homogeneous settings. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to test the effect of CHF CM on the 90-day readmission rate in a more heterogeneous setting.", 
    "65": "A total of 287 patients admitted to the hospital with the primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF, left ventricular dysfunction of less than 40%, or radiologic evidence of pulmonary edema for which they underwent diuresis were randomized. The intervention consisted of 4 major components: early discharge planning, patient and family CHF education, 12 weeks of telephone follow-up, and promotion of optimal CHF medications.", 
    "66": "The 90-day readmission rates were equal for the CM and usual care groups (37%). Total inpatient and outpatient median costs and readmission median cost were reduced 14% and 26%, respectively, for the intervention group. Patients in the CM group were more likely to be taking CHF medication at target doses, but dosages did not increase significantly throughout 12 weeks. Although both groups took their medications as prescribed equally well, the rest of the adherence to treatment plan was significantly better in the CM group. Subgroup analysis of patients who lived locally and saw a cardiologist showed a significant decrease in CHF readmissions for the intervention group (P =.03).", 
    "67": "These results suggest several limitations to the generalizability of the CHF CM-improved outcome link in a heterogeneous setting. One explanation is that the lack of coordinated system supports and varied accessibility to care in an extended, nonnetworked physician setting limits the effectiveness of the CM.", 
    "68": "Aortic stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are predictors of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Attenuation of arterial stiffness and regression of LVH had a favorable effect on survival in these patients, but this favorable effect was observed in less than 50% of patients, the rest being resistant to therapeutical interventions. The aim of this study was to analyze the factors associated with this resistance to treatment.", 
    "69": "138 patients on HD were studied during a follow-up survey. From entry until the end of follow up, the changes of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and of LV mass were measured in response to treatment with antihypertensive drugs and erythropoietin, together with measurements of blood chemistry, including high-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP). Patients with decreased aortic PWV were considered to be responders (N = 68), the others to be nonresponders (N = 70).", 
    "70": "Nonresponders were older (P < 0.05) and had persistently higher systolic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure. Responders were treated more frequently with an ACE inhibitor (P < 0.001), and had lower serum CRP (P < 0.01). The baseline PWV, as well as the changes of PWV and LV mass during the follow-up were significantly and independently correlated with serum CRP level (P < 0.001). According to logistic regression after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, history of CVD, and the nonspecific cardiovascular risk factors, the improvement of aortic stiffness and LV hypertrophy was positively associated with prescription of ACE inhibitor (P < 0.0001), and negatively with the serum CRP level (P < 0.01).", 
    "71": "These results indicate that in HD patients, the presence of low-grade inflammation decreases the efficiency of cardiovascular therapeutic interventions and participates in the persistence of cardiovascular hemodynamic overload.", 
    "72": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is a well-established principle in the treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) in states of impaired endothelial function. The successful use of ACE inhibitors encouraged attempts to inhibit other key enzymes in the regulation of vascular tone, such as the neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Similar to ACE, NEP is an endothelial cell surface metalloproteinase that is involved in the degradation of several regulatory peptides, including the natriuretic peptides, and, thus, NEP inhibition augments vasodilatation and natriuresis through increased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). By inhibiting the RAS and potentiating the natriuretic peptide system at the same time, combined NEP/ACE inhibitors, the so-called vasopeptidase inhibitors, reduce vasoconstriction and enhance vasodilatation, thereby decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure. Within the vessel wall this may lead to a reduction of vasoconstrictor and proliferative mediators, such as angiotensin II and endothelin-1, and may increase local levels of bradykinin as well as natriuretic peptides. Even though first results of both preclinical and clinical studies indicate that combined inhibition of ACE and NEP by vasopeptidase inhibitors represents a promising strategy in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, angioedema occurs more frequently on vasopeptidase inhibition as compared to ACE inhibition. To establish vasopeptidase inhibition as a novel option in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, further validation of efficacy and safety of this promising therapeutic principle is mandatory.", 
    "73": "Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)-inhibited carboxypeptidase from cat liver was purified 148-fold by chromatography on CM- and DEAE-cellulose with 27.3% yield. Molecular weight of the enzyme is 100-110 kD as determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. The enzyme has maximum activity at pH 5.50-5.75; its activity is completely inhibited by PMSF or p-chloromercuribenzoate and partially inhibited by iodoacetamide. EDTA, 2-mercaptoethanol, N-ethylmaleimide, Co(2+) and Ca2+, basic carboxypeptidase inhibitor guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril do not influence its activity. The enzyme cleaves arginine from enkephalin-Leu5-Arg6 and dansyl-Phe-Leu-Arg to form enkephalin-Leu5 and dansyl-Phe-Leu, respectively, and very slowly cleaves leucine from carbobenzoxy-Gly-Leu. Further cleavage of either enkephalin-Leu5 or dansyl-Phe-Leu was not detected. The highest activity of this enzyme was found in adrenal glands and testicles; this activity was 30% lower in hypophysis, and still lower in liver and kidney. The PMSF-inhibited carboxypeptidase activity in brain was about 6-16 times lower than that in adrenal gland. In brain regions, the highest activity was detected in gray matter of cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum, and slightly lower activity was found in thalamus/hypothalamus, striatum, and hippocampus. The lowest activity was found in quadrigeminal bodies, medulla oblongata, and white matter of cerebral hemispheres. The enzyme exists mainly in soluble form; the activity of membrane-associated enzyme is 7-25% of soluble enzyme activity depending on tissue type. We consider here a possible involvement of PMSF-inhibited carboxypeptidase in the metabolism of biologically active peptides.", 
    "74": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common and disabling syndrome with a poor prognosis. It is a major and increasing public health problem. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis are the standards treatments for CHF. Other drugs, such as beta-blockers, spironolactone, calcium antagonists, vasodilators, and antiarrhythmic agents are used to counteract the progression of the syndrome or to improve the hemodynamic profile. Despite optimum treatment with neurohumoral antagonists, prognosis of CHF remains poor; the patients complain of persistent reductions in their exercise capacity and quality of life. Fatigue and shortness of breath, two common and disabling symptoms in patient with CHF, are relatively independent from hemodynamic and neuroendocrine changes, although they seem to be related to the impairment of peripheral muscle metabolism and energetic phosphate production. Therefore, CHF is a complex metabolic syndrome in which the metabolism of cardiac and peripheral muscles is impaired and novel therapeutic strategies have been aimed at positive modulation with compounds such as carnitine, trimetazidine, and ranolazine.", 
    "75": "Based upon the results of the RALES trial and accumulating evidence about the role of aldosterone and aldosterone receptor antagonism in various disease states, the authors anticipate that aldosterone receptor antagonists will become standard therapy, along with ACE inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents, in patients with heart failure that is caused by systolic left ventricular dysfunction. Furthermore, the prospect of the use of these agents in other disease states that have implicated an activated rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade, such as diastolic dysfunction, aging, and atherosclerosis, remains to be tested. Until further data from well-designed, prospective, randomized trials are available, the use of aldosterone receptor antagonists should be restricted to patients with severe or progressive heart failure caused by systolic left ventricular dysfunction in whom serum creatinine level is < or = 2.0 mg/dL and serum potassium levels are < 5.0 meq/L at baseline.", 
    "76": "ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality, reduce hospitalization, reduce symptoms, and increase exercise capacity in patients with heart failure and a large heart (low ejection fraction). The evidence is overwhelming. There are some subgroups of patients, such as the very elderly and those with a normal ejection fraction, where uncertainty still exists. The combination of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor is currently the proper treatment of congestive heart failure; a beta-blocker should be added in selected patients. The evidence for the efficacy of ARB is less persuasive and, for the present, this class of drug should be prescribed only when an ACE inhibitor cannot be tolerated. The results of the trials emphasize an emerging problem in medicine, namely how to evaluate a new treatment that may be as efficacious as current therapy but with fewer side-effects. Proving equivalence in efficacy will be difficult, requiring large studies comparing new drugs with the best current treatment. The most common etiology of heart failure is coronary heart disease. If further studies provide more support for the idea that ACE inhibitors prevent ischemic episodes and delay the onset of heart failure, then a new indication for ACE inhibitors will be the prevention of heart failure.", 
    "77": "Angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, but their inhibitory actions on angiotensin I-induced increases in blood pressure in heart failure are not clear. Angiotensin I blocking and cardioprotective properties of the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril were studied in a rat model of dilated cardiomyopathy after autoimmune myocarditis. Low-dose candesartan (0.5 mg/kg) showed the same angiotensin I blocking action as high-dose quinapril (20 mg/kg) in rats with heart failure. Twenty-eight days after immunization, surviving Lewis rats (43/58, 74%) were divided into three groups and given quinapril at 20 mg/kg per day (group Q, n = 14), candesartan at 0.5 mg/kg per day (group C, n = 14) or vehicle alone (group V, n = 15). After oral administration for 1 month, four of 15 (27%) rats in group V and two of 14 (14%) in group C died. None of the animals in group Q died. Although angiotensin II levels of the blood and the left ventricle in group V [367 +/- 26 and 437 +/- 18% versus normal rats (group N)] were significantly higher than those in group N (both p < 0.01), they were reduced in group Q (88 +/- 32 and 169 +/- 53%, both p < 0.01). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and the area of myocardial fibrosis were lower, and the first derivative +/-dP/dt was higher in group Q (7.0 +/- 1.7 mmHg, 9 +/- 3% and +3451+/- 170/-3182 +/- 186 mmHg/s, respectively) than in group V (16.7 +/- 1.3 mmHg, 36 +/- 6% and +2601 +/- 235/-2156 +/- 257 mmHg/s, respectively) and in group C (11.2 +/- 2.0 mmHg, 26 +/- 4% and +3063 +/- 164/-2734 +/- 174 mmHg/s, respectively). Although levels of expression of transforming growth factor beta1 and collagen III mRNA in groupV (367 +/- 26 and 437 +/- 18% versus group N) were significantly higher than those in group N (both p < 0.01), they were reduced in group Q (88 +/- 32 and 169 +/- 53%, both p < 0.01). These results suggested that although low-dose candesartan can block increases in blood pressure with circulating angiotensin I to the same extent as high-dose quinapril, it does not confer sufficient protection against injury from the renin-angiotensin system in heart failure.", 
    "78": "The theoretical advantages of the angiotensin II receptors blockers (ARB) are slowly but progressively becoming a reality for patients with congestive heart failure. ARB are recommended in patients who cannot take ACE inhibitors as a plausible alternative for modulating the renin angiotensin system. After the recently published Val-HeFT trial, the addition of an ARB (valsartan) can be considered in patients who remain severely symptomatic despite optimal therapy in order to reduce hospitalization for heart failure and improve symptoms particularly if the patients cannot tolerates beta-blockers. Among patients with type 2 diabetes and no clinical signs of congestive heart failure ARB (losartan) are able to reduce the probability of developing congestive heart failure.", 
    "79": "The combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist (ARB) could provide a higher degree of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system(RAS) than either agent alone. The primary aim of this study was to look at the effect of three therapeutic regimens (titrated ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) versus titrated ARB versus the combination of an ACE-I and an ARB) on the attainment of adequate blood pressure (BP) control and antiproteinuric effect. Both ACE-I and ARB were titrated as monotherapy up to the maximal recommended dose.", 
    "80": "A pilot randomised, parallel group open-label study was conducted in 36 patients with primary renal disease, proteinuria above 1.5 g/day and BP >140/90 mmHg while on therapy with an ACE-I. Patients were randomly assigned to (1) benazepril, n=12; (2) valsartan, n=12; or (3) benazepril plus valsartan, n=12. Other antihypertensive therapies could also be added to attain goal BP (<140/90 mmHg). The primary endpoint was the change in proteinuria during six months of follow-up.", 
    "81": "In the presence of similar BP decreases and stable creatinine clearance values, mean proteinuria decreases were 0.5+1.7, 1.2+2.0 and 2.5+1.8 g/day in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. When compared with baseline values, only the fall induced by the combination of ARB and ACE-I attained statistical significance (p<0.05).", 
    "82": "The antiproteinuric capacity of monotherapy at recommended doses with either an ACE-I or an ARB is lower than that obtained with the combination of the two drugs.", 
    "83": "We previously showed that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (losartan) reduced infarct size and improved endothelial function in a rat model of ischaemia-reperfusion. The present study was undertaken to see if aspirin (ASA) antagonised the beneficial effects of captopril or losartan.", 
    "84": "One hundred and fourteen Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into six groups; Control, ASA, captopril, losartan, ASA+captopril, and ASA+losartan. ASA, captopril or losartan were given at a concentration of 40 mg/kg/day in drinking water. After six weeks of pre-treatment, the rats were subjected to 17 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 120 minutes of reperfusion, with haemodynamic and ECG monitoring. During the reperfusion period, the effective refractory period (ERP), ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) and bleeding time (BT) were measured. In fresh aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine, endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations were assessed using acetylcholine and nitroglycerin.", 
    "85": "Haemodynamic changes were not different between the groups. Serum ASA concentrations were 0.5, 1.1 and 0.6 mg/dl in the ASA, ASA+captopril and ASA+losartan groups, respectively, and BT was prolonged (p<0.01). ASA alone reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation (-29+8 vs. -69+11%, p<0.01), but did not change endothelium-independent relaxation. ASA did not affect endothelial relaxation induced by acetylcholine in the presence of either captopril or losartan. Angiotensin I and ERP were elevated by captopril and losartan. Angiotensin II and VFT were elevated by losartan. ASA with captopril, captopril and losartan equally reduced infarct size, compared with control (39+3, 39+4, and 39+5 vs. 53+3%, all p<0.05).", 
    "86": "Captopril and losartan had similar cardiovascular protective effects in a rat model of ischaemia-reperfusion. Aspirin did not attenuate the cardiovascular protective effects of captopril or losartan.", 
    "87": "Several clinical trials have consistently shown that antihypertensive treatment, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) reduces albuminuria in Type 1 diabetic patients. More recently, data on the beneficial effects of ACE-I on the preservation of glomerular filtration rate and renal ultrastructure have emerged. However, in general, these trials have recruited a wide spectrum of diabetics, including some patients with severe albuminuria. Thus, the question of the ideal stage at which to instigate what is likely to be lifelong therapy in young people still remains unanswered. Exercise is known to significantly increase both blood pressure (BP) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE), both of which are important determinants of progression of nephropathy in diabetes. Thus, it is possible that exercise may have an adverse effect on diabetic renal disease. The effects of ACE-I on exercise-BP and exercise-UAE in microalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic patients has not been examined in long-term placebo-controlled studies. In the second part of this two-part review, we examine the effects of the ACE-I, lisinopril, 20 mg o.d. for two years, in comparison with placebo, on UAE, 24-hour ambulatory BP, exercise-BP, exercise-UAE and renal haemodynamics in 22 patients with Type 1 diabetes and low-grade microalbuminuria. We further discuss the effects of ACE-I on nephropathy and other complications of diabetes.", 
    "88": "Since renin catalyses the first and rate-limiting step of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) cascade, interruption of the generation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by renin inhibitors at this highly specific initial step of the cascade has long been a therapeutic goal. The early development of renin inhibitors was hampered by problems with bioavailability and high costs of synthesis. However, more recently a potent non-peptidic inhibitor of renin, aliskiren, with acceptable oral bioavailability, has been synthesised. Aliskiren effectively reduces Ang II levels in normal volunteers and has been shown to lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Renin inhibitors would be expected to have similar, but not identical effects to those of the established RAS antagonists. Due to the lack of effective alternative enzyme pathways, blockade of Ang II production may be more effective with renin inhibition than with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Furthermore, because renin has high specificity for only one substrate, angiotensinogen, side-effects would be expected to be less frequent. It is currently unclear whether blockade of Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptors, leaving other Ang II receptors (AT2, AT3 and AT4) unblocked, is preferable to the reduction in plasma and tissue Ang II levels achieved with either ACE or renin inhibition. Pharmacological suppression of the RAS, through ACE inhibition, or blockade of AT1, beta-adrenoceptor or mineralocorticoid receptors, has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, heart failure and nephropathy. While, to date, aliskiren has only been shown to reduce BP, it appears likely that orally-active renin inhibitors could prove useful in the management of a wide range of cardiovascular pathologies.", 
    "89": "Although the angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) shares the angiotensin-II-blocking activity with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), pharmacological mechanisms of action of these agents differ. We evaluated the temporal profiles of action of ACE-I and ARB on urinary protein excretion and nitrate/nitrate (NO(x)) excretion in hypertensive (140 and/or 90 mmHg) patients with chronic renal disease (serum creatinine < 265 (range, 44-265) micromol/l or creatinine clearance > 30 (range, 30-121) ml/min). Patients with mild (<1 g/day; range, 0.4-1.0) and moderate proteinuria (>1 g/day; range, 1.1-6.9) were randomly assigned to ACE-I- and ARB-treated groups, and were treated with ACE-I (trandolapril or perindopril) or ARB(losartan or candesartan) for 48 weeks. In all groups, treatment with ACE-I or ARB decreased blood pressure to the same level, but had no effect on creatinine clearance. In patients with mild proteinuria, neither ACE-I nor ARB altered urinary protein excretion. In patients with moderate proteinuria, ACE-I caused 44 +/- 6% reduction in proteinuria (from 2.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.5 +/- 0.4 g/day, n = 14) at 12 weeks, and this beneficial effect persisted throughout the protocol (48 weeks, 1.2 +/- 0.2 g/day). In contrast, ARB did not produce a significant decrease in proteinuria at 12 weeks (23 +/- 8%, n = 13), but a 41 +/- 6% reduction in proteinuria was observed at 48 weeks. Similarly, although early (12 weeks) increases in urinary NO(x) excretion were observed with ACE-I (from 257 +/- 70 to 1111 +/- 160 micromol/day) and ARB (from 280 +/- 82 to 723 +/- 86 micromol/day), the ARB-induced increase in NO(x) excretion was smaller than that by ACE-I (P < 0.05). In conclusion, although both ACE-I and ARB reduce blood pressure similarly, the effect of these agents on proteinuria differs in chronic renal disease with moderate proteinuria. Relatively early onset of the proteinuria-reducing effect was observed with ACE-I, which paralleled the increase in urinary NO(x) excretion. Conversely, ARB decreased proteinuria and increased urinary NO(x) excretion gradually. These time course-dependent changes in proteinuria and urinary NO(x) may reflect the pharmacological property of ACE-I and ARB, with regard to the action on bradykinin.", 
    "90": "Enhanced oxidative stress is involved in the progression of renal disease. Since angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have been shown to improve the antioxidative defence, we investigated, in patients with nondiabetic nephropathy, the short-term effect of the ACEI ramipril on parameters of oxidative stress, such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), homocysteine (Hcy), and lipid peroxidation products. Ramipril (2.5-5.0 mg/day) was administered to 12 newly diagnosed patients for 2 months and data compared with a patient group under conventional therapy (diuretic/beta-blockers) and with age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (CTRL). Patients had mild to moderate renal insufficiency and showed, in the plasma, higher fluorescent AGE and carboxymethyllysine (CML) levels, as well as elevated concentrations of AOPPs, lipofuscin and Hcy when compared with CTRL. Basal data of the patients on conventional therapy did not differ significantly from the ramipril group, except for higher Hcy levels in the latter. Administration of ramipril resulted in a drop in blood pressure and proteinuria, while creatinine clearance remained the same. The fluorescent AGEs exhibited a mild but significant decline, yet CML concentration was unchanged. The AOPP and malondialdehyde concentrations decreased, while a small rise in neopterin levels was evident after treatment. The mentioned parameters were not affected significantly in the conventionally treated patients. Evidence that ramipril administration results in a mild decline of fluorescent AGEs is herein presented for the first time. The underlying mechanism may be decreased oxidative stress, as indicated by a decline in AOPPs and malondialdehyde.", 
    "91": "The absence of nocturnal fall in blood pressure (BP) is named as nondipper status, which has been shown to be an additional risk factor for the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular events in several high-risk groups. The aim of this study was to determine the influences of the nondipper status and nocturnal blood pressure loads on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in renal transplant recipients. A total of 35 nondiabetic renal transplant recipients were included into the study. A 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed for all recipients. The nondipper status was defined as either an increase in night-time mean arterial pressure (MAP) or a decrease of no more than 10% of daytime MAP. LVMI was measured by using two-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography. The night-time systolic blood pressure (SBP) load was defined as the percentage of the time, during which SBP exceeded 125 mmHg during night time. The nondipping was common among renal transplant recipients, of whom 60% were nondipper in our study. LVMI was significantly higher in the nondipper group vs the dipper group (133 +/- 35 g/m(2) vs 109 +/- 26 g/m(2), P = 0.04). A fall in MAP at night time was 14.5 +/- 4.3% in the dipper group, while it was 1.4 +/- 6.1% in the nondipper group (P < 0.001). On stepwise multiple regression analysis, night-time SBP load and haemoglobin were independent predictors of LVMI (R(2) = 0.53). In conclusion, nondipping is common after renal transplantation. Night-time SBP load and low haemoglobin are closely related to the increase in LVMI in renal transplant recipients. ABPM may be a more useful tool in optimizing treatment strategies to reduce cardio-vascular events in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "92": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is critically involved in cardiovascular and renal function and in disease conditions, and has been shown to be a far more complex system than initially thought. A recently discovered homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)--ACE2--appears to negatively regulate the RAS. ACE2 cleaves Ang I and Ang II into the inactive Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7, respectively. ACE2 is highly expressed in kidney and heart and is especially confined to the endothelium. With quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, ACE2 was defined as a QTL on the X chromosome in rat models of hypertension. In these animal models, kidney ACE2 messenger RNA and protein expression were markedly reduced, making ACE2 a candidate gene for this QTL. Targeted disruption of ACE2 in mice failed to elicit hypertension, but resulted in severe impairment in myocardial contractility with increased angiotensin II levels. Genetic ablation of ACE in the ACE2 null mice rescued the cardiac phenotype. These genetic data show that ACE2 is an essential regulator of heart function in vivo. Basal renal morphology and function were not altered by the inactivation of ACE2. The novel role of ACE2 in hydrolyzing several other peptides-such as the apelin peptides, opioids, and kinin metabolites-raises the possibility that peptide systems other than angiotensin and its derivatives also may have an important role in regulating cardiovascular and renal function.", 
    "93": "Recently, we have demonstrated that heart failure in rats is associated with a myopathy altering energy metabolism in different muscles, but the origin of this myopathy is still unknown. Here, we studied the possible involvement of increased angiotensin II (Ang II) by treatment with perindopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The beneficial effects of ACE inhibition could result either from vasodilatation-induced cardiac unloading or from inhibition of the direct angiotensin action on the muscle cells. The model of aortic banding with persisting left ventricular (LV) overload where the cardiac unloading does not occur allows to distinguish between the two effects of ACE inhibition. Four months after aortic clipping (just before the treatment), echocardiographic study showed an impairment of the systolic function (decrease of the LV shortening by 30% and ejection fraction by 21%). Ten-week treatment with perindopril dramatically decreased Ang II plasma level but did not reduce LV hypertrophy though a significant decrease in right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy occurred. Perindopril did not improve alterations in activities of energy metabolism enzymes (creatine kinase, citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase) either in ventricular or in skeletal (gastrocnemius) muscle. Similarly, ACE inhibition did not improve the main parameters of mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized muscle fibers. These data suggest that the generalized metabolic myopathy induced by the hemodynamic abnormalities conditioned by the continuous LV overload (aorta clipping) does not result from the increase in Ang II level per se. Correction of hemodynamic parameters and LV unloading seem to be the prerequisite for the improvement of muscle energy metabolism abnormalities.",

Exchange of four or eight thiopyridyl groups by captopril occurs at room temperature in methanol almost quantitatively. Exchange using the peptide requires higher temperatures and guanidinium chloride in DMF. While exchange on the tetravalent scaffold with four peptides is almost quantitative, sterics retard formation of the octavalent conjugate: the hexavalent conjugate forms readily.", 
    "95": "We investigated the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (temocapril) and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (olmesartan) on changes in myocardial sympathetic nervous activity, fatty acid metabolism and myocardial blood flow using 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine, 125I-beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid and 99mTc-tetrofosmin, respectively, in rats with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent isoproterenol administration (3 mg/kg per day) for 1 week by osmotic mini-pump. The hearts were excised and analyzed for the uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine. Beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid and tetrofosmin in 11 segments in four groups; sham group (saline), isoproterenol group (isoproterenol alone), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group (isoproterenol and temocapril), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker group (isoproterenol and olmesartan). Isoproterenol significantly increased the heart weight compared with the sham group, whereas it was significantly blunted in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker groups. The ratio of the percent kilogram dose per gram of meta-iodobenzylguanidine to tetrofosmin, an index of myocardial sympathetic nervous activity, was significantly decreased in the isoproterenol group (0.18 +/- 0.01) compared with the sham group (0.41 +/- 0.03). Importantly, these changes were significantly improved in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (0.28 +/- 0.01) and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker groups (0.32 +/- 0.01). The ratio of the percent kilogram dose per gram of beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid to tetrofosmin, an index of myocardial fatty acid metabolism, was significantly decreased in the isoproterenol group (1.30 +/- 0.03) compared with the sham group (1.60 +/- 0.10). In contrast, there were no significant differences in beta-methyl-iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid to tetrofosmin ratios between the sham and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor groups, or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker group. Cardiac hypertrophy induced by chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation is accompanied by impairment of sympathetic nervous activity and fatty acid metabolism. These abnormalities are effectively prevented by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker.", 
    "96": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of chronic treatment with an orally active chymase inhibitor, 4-[1-(naphthylmethyl)benzimidazol-2-ylthio]butanoic acid (TEI-E548), in a hamster myocardial infarction model. In the first experiment, after confirming the biochemical inhibitory action of TEI-E548 on human and hamster chymases (Ki = 6.2 and 30.6 nM, respectively), the biological action of TEI-E548 in vivo was assessed by the inhibition of hamster chymase-induced microvascular leakage. In the second experiment, myocardial infarction was produced by coronary artery ligation in male Syrian hamsters. TEI-E548 (0.1% containing chow) was given 24 h after surgery and continued for 3 or 5 weeks, while the control and sham-operated groups were fed a standard chow. The survival rate was assessed in each group. At the end of each study period, blood pressure was measured at the left hind-limb, the heart rate and cardiac function were measured by echocardiography, the end-diastolic pressure by a direct catheterization, and organ weights and biochemical parameters, including plasma renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities and plasma angiotensin I and angiotensin II concentrations, were measured. In the first experiment, a standard chow containing 0.1% TEI-E548 completely inhibited the hamster chymase-induced microvascular leakage. In the second experiment, TEI-E548 treatment significantly increased the survival rate (37% versus control), and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy (13% versus control) and end-diastolic left ventricular pressure (34% versus control), but it did not decrease the infarction size nor improve the ejection fraction. The plasma angiotensin II concentration post-myocardial infarction was significantly suppressed by TEI-E548 throughout the study period. We conclude that TEI-E548 is an orally active useful chymase inhibitor and improves survival and cardiac hypertrophy of the post-myocardial infarction hamster.", 
    "97": "To examine the effect of the addition of a beta-blocker in the treatment of chronic heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, we compared the change of left ventricular remodeling and the prognosis between patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and patients who had beta-blockers added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Fifty-seven patients were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in addition to combination therapy with furosemide, spironolactone and digoxin. In 60 patients, a beta-blocker was administered in addition to combination therapy with furosemide, spironolactone, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Changes of left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and end-systole, fractional shortening, cardiac events and death were examined during the follow-up periods. The mean follow-up periods were 4.9 +/- 4.1 years in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group and 3.9 +/- 2.5 years in the beta-blocker group, respectively. Baseline hemodynamic characteristics showed no significant differences between the two groups. After the treatment, the heart rate significantly decreased in both groups and the systolic blood pressure increased in the beta-blocker group. Both left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and end-systole significantly decreased in both groups. Fractional shortening increased from 17.0 +/- 7.6 to 19.8 +/- 8.9% (p = 0.017) in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group and from 16.6 +/- 7.2 to 24.7 +/- 8.0% (p < 0.0001) in the beta-blocker group, respectively. Changes of left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and at end-systole, and fractional shortening were all greater in the beta-blocker group than in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group. The event-free rate and the cumulative survival rate during the follow-up periods were markedly better in the beta-blocker group than in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group (p = 0.0019 and p = 0.0099, respectively). These results indicate that the suppression of left ventricular remodeling and the improvement of prognosis in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are markedly stronger in the beta-blocker group than in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group. Thus, beta-blocker should be added to patients with dilated cardiomyopathy treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "98": "The prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF) doubles with each decade after the fourth decade. CHF is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems play a pivotal role in the progression and deterioration of CHF. Multiple, double-blinded, randomized and placebo-controlled trials have shown significant survival benefit and improved quality of life with the use of neurohormonal antagonists, viz. angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers, beta-blockers and spironolactone in the management of CHF. While important for the symptom control, diuretics and digoxin are not associated with any decrease in mortality in patients with CHF. Despite overwhelming evidence of decreased mortality and morbidity, neurohormonal antagonists remain under-utilized in the management of CHF. This article will review the current evidence for the survival benefit with the use of neurohormonal antagonists in CHF.", 
    "99": "Recent data on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have revealed various mechanisms damaging the vessel wall by the reactive oxidative substances, mainly by the oxidised LDL, which lead to an inflammation process, resulting in the thickening of the arterial wall and atherosclerotic plaque formation. In these events the oxidative free radicals exert a lot of harmful effects: by the further oxidation of lipids, activation of smooth cells and macrophages, inducing apoptosis and necrosis of endothelial cells. These mechanisms can be blocked by some drugs at several points as listed in the paper. The results of observational studies and clinical trials by vitamin E, angiotensin convertase enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin type-1 receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and statin treatment are reviewed and evaluated. Possibilities of appropriate antioxidant substitution modes are put forward. Achievements in the regression of atherosclerotic plaques are discussed, since these therapeutic modalities render atherosclerosis a treatable disease.",

Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure in HD patients have been suggested to contribute to anaemia as well by inhibiting erythropoiesis. Our purpose in this study is to investigate whether or not losartan, an angiotensin II (ATII) receptor antagonist, is causing rHuEPO resistance.",

    "104": "Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in western or westernised countries and the largest contributor to the total cost of diabetes care around the world. In addition to the development of diabetic nephropathy and end-stage renal failure, diabetic patients with evidence of albuminuria have a much higher risk of developing myocardial infarctions, cerebrovascular accidents, severe progressive retinopathy, and peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. A cumulative incidence of diabetic nephropathy has been documented after duration of diabetes of at least 25 years in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, although more recent studies have demonstrated a substantial reduction of its incidence. Before the onset of overt proteinuria, there are several renal functional changes, including renal hyperfiltration, hyperperfusion, and increasing capillary permeability to macromolecules. Basement-membrane thickening and mesangial expansion have long been recognized as pathological hallmark of diabetic nephropathy. It has been postulated that diabetic nephropathy occurs as a result of the interplay of metabolic and haemodynamic factors in the renal microcirculation. Hyperglycaemia plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetic renal disease, but genetic factors are also of crucial importance. The accumulation of advanced glycosilation end products (AGEPs), the activation of isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) and the acceleration of the aldose reductase pathway may explain how hyperglycaemia damages vessels. Growth factors (i.e. TGF-b, IGF-1, VEGF) may also play an important role in the pathogenesis. There is a familial clustering of diabetic kidney disease: a number of gene loci have been investigated to try to explain the genetic susceptibility to this complication. The two main treatment strategies for prevention of diabetic nephropathy are improved glycaemic control and blood pressure lowering, particularly using drugs such angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Many potential treatment modalities in preventing and treating diabetic nephropathy are presently being evaluated; some of them will possibly be available in the near future in order to try to modify the natural course of kidney involvement and disease in patients with diabetes.",

In the past 12-18 months, there have been several reported advances in our understanding of beta-blocker therapy for heart failure. Despite these advances, there remain several unanswered questions with regard to beta-blockers. These involve, firstly, clarifying the underlying mechanisms of action of beta-blockers; secondly, further analysing patients with systolic heart failure who are not well-studied in major clinical trials (e.g. the elderly); thirdly, investigating unexplored indications for beta-blockers in heart failure; and finally, directly examining the clinical relevance of pharmacological differences among agents. The impact of genetic polymorphisms on the response to beta-blocker therapy, as well as interaction of these agents with future heart failure therapies, requires extensive investigation.", 
    "114": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or with angiotensin receptor antagonists confers patients with arterial hypertension (AH) and associated risk factors, target organ lesion or cardiovascular disease with greater protection in morbidity and mortality terms. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of irbesartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on the absolute cardiovascular risk in a cohort of hypertensive patients with moderate, high, or very high cardiovascular risk. This was a multicenter, prospective, observational, cohort study with 1974 patients (63 11 years; 47% males) with newly diagnosed essential AH or AH non-controlled with anti-hypertensive monotherapy, and moderate to very high cardiovascular risk. Irbesartan therapy at a dosage of 150300 mg was instituted as monotherapy or associated with hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg. The clinical follow-up was 6 months. The evaluated parameters included the absolute cardiovascular risk, measured either quantitatively (Framingham algorithm) or qualitatively (low, moderate, high, and very high risk groups following the WHO/International Hypertension Society guidelines). Irbesartan therapy led to a significant (p = 0.0001) decrease in SBP (from 170.9 18.4 to 138.5 16.5 mmHg) and DBP (from 96.6 11 to 82 9 mmHg). The quantitative absolute cardiovascular risk decreased by 29.8% (from 12.14 8 to 8.65 6.2; p < 0.0001). The percentage of patients with very high cardiovascular risk decreased from 1.52% to 0.51% and that for patients with high cardiovascular risk from 92.77% to 88.32%. The latter patients changed to the moderate risk group. As a result, this moderate risk group increased from 5.71% to 11.17%. The adverse reaction rate was very low as only 2.2% of patients had some adverse reaction. In conclusion, irbesartan as monotherapy or associated with hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to be effective in reducing the absolute cardiovascular risk, which is obtained by a substantial decrease in arterial pressure and a good safety profile on the biochemical parameters. Tolerability was excellent, with a very low rate of adverse reactions.", 
    "115": "Abstract Antithrombotic treatment has now been joined by other evidence-based drug interventions for prevention of stroke, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. The efficacy of oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation has not been seen in other stroke-prone groups, although trials are continuing. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging improves diagnostic accuracy in acute stroke, which is important in arriving at the right secondary prevention strategy. Carotid endarterectomy has been shown to be beneficial for 50-69% symptomatic -stenosis but with a much narrower therapeutic index than for 70-99% stenosis. A comparison of endarterectomy with angioplasty and/or stent placement has been the subject of one small trial suggesting similar procedural stroke and mortality risks.

Clinical response to the treatment was analyzed using the Students' t-test. After a median period of 54 months (range 36-88 months) follow-up, five patients were alive at a median age of 74 (range 43-88) months. Median (range) plasma albumin rose from 11 (6-17) g/l at the start of treatment to 18 (15-22) g/l and 21 (18-25) g/l after 6 and 12 months treatment, respectively ( P=0.001 and P=0.0006). Albumin infusions per patient per month decreased from 7 (0-18) to 0 (0-30) in the 6 months post treatment ( P=0.017). The median (range) height standard deviation scores at 12 months and 30 months from onset of treatment were -1.56 (-2.96 to 0.41) and -1.43 (-2.40 to 0.90), respectively. In conclusion, management of CNS with captopril and indomethacin therapy in combination with unilateral nephrectomy achieves significant improvements in plasma albumin and reduces the need for albumin infusions and time in hospital, while growth is maintained. Second nephrectomy, dialysis, and transplantation can be delayed until the 3rd year of life or longer.",

    "129": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system as a regulator of blood pressure, body fluids, electrolytes, and neurohormonal activation has been established for more than two decades. The dramatic benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on overall mortality, progression to heart failure, and major cardiovascular events were first demonstrated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) or left ventricular dysfunction. ACE inhibitors should be prescribed for all patients with symptomatic CHF and for all asymptomatic patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% to 40%, unless contraindicated or not tolerated, and therapy should be continued indefinitely. Data have shown that ACE inhibition improves oxidative stress, endothelial and ventricular function, and reduces ventricular remodeling as well as progression of carotid intimal and medial thickening. Current evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors should be prescribed as early as possible for all patients with acute myocardial infarction, unless contraindicated or not tolerated, and that they should be continued for at least 6 weeks; moreover, because these patients automatically qualify as high-risk individuals, indefinite therapy should be considered. Likewise, individuals at increased risk for major cardiovascular events (diabetic patients with additional risk factors and patients with known vascular disease) should be prescribed ACE inhibitors, unless contraindicated or not tolerated, and therapy should be continued indefinitely. There is not sufficient evidence at present to recommend the use of ACE inhibitors after coronary revascularization for the specific goal of preventing restenosis or graft disease, in the absence of decreased ejection fraction, CHF, or a new myocardial infarction.", 
    "130": "The clinical diagnosis of renal artery stenosis relies on a high index of suspicion and confirmation by noninvasive imaging modalities. There are three distinct clinical syndromes associated with renal artery stenosis: renin-dependent hypertension, essential hypertension, and ischemic nephropathy. Clinical features that should heighten suspicion for renal artery stenosis include abrupt-onset or accelerated hypertension at any age, unexplained acute or chronic azotemia, azotemia induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, asymmetric renal dimensions, and congestive heart failure with normal ventricular function. Patients with true renin-dependent (renovascular) hypertension are typically young or middle-age women with renal fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Initial therapy for renovascular hypertension associated with FMD is an ACE inhibitor; refractory hypertension responds readily to balloon angioplasty without stenting. Elderly patients with generalized atherosclerosis and hypertension often have atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS); hypertension in these patients is usually not renin dependent (ie, essential hypertension). Hypertension alone, even if treated with multiple medications, is not a compelling indication for renal artery revascularization; these patients should be treated aggressively with antihypertensive medical therapy. Renal artery revascularization with stenting may be considered for refractory severe hypertension, and would be expected to improve blood control and modestly reduce medication requirements. Renal revascularization rarely cures hypertension in patients with ARAS. Patients with ARAS, hypertension, and end-organ injury should be considered for renal revascularization. Manifestations of end-organ injury include nonischemic pulmonary edema; hypertensive crisis associated with acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, or neurologic impairment; and renal insufficiency. Ischemic nephropathy is best treated before the development of advanced renal failure. The best candidates for revascularization are those with baseline serum creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL, bilateral renal artery stenosis, normal renal resistive indices, no proteinuria, and one or more manifestations of end-organ injury. In these patients, renal revascularization is best accomplished by stenting, although surgical revascularization may be considered in patients with concomitant severe aortic aneurysmal or occlusive disease.", 
    "131": "The duration of action of antihypertensive drugs may be assessed by several methods using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The aim of this double-blind, randomized study was to compare the time-effect profile of once daily Trandolapril (Tra) 2 mg vs. Quinapril (Qui) 20 mg in 92 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. All patients received placebo during a 30-day run-in period followed by 2 months of active therapy and 1-day medication omission. ABPM was conducted on each period. 24 h antihypertensive coverage was assessed by trough:peak ratio (T/P) and smoothness index (SI) methods. Residual lowering of blood pressure after single-blind, 1 day medication omission was investigated as the SBP/DBP 48-h trough effect. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the mean SBP/DBP peak or trough effect. Individual T/P were not normally distributed and had very large variations explained by BP random- and activity-related fluctuations. Group T/P were 0.85 for Tra and 0.62 for Qui. The SI values were normally distributed and not statistically different between the two treatment groups. After dose omission, Qui was ineffective at 48-h trough while Tra retained a significant effect (SBP/DBP = -3.4/-4.3 mmHg) and this difference was even greater in ABPM-responders. Comparison of the trough:peak ratios and smoothness indexes of Tra and Qui failed to show any statistically significant difference on 24-h antihypertensive coverage. Nevertheless, residual lowering of blood pressure at 48-h trough suggests that Tra had a longer duration of action than Qui.",

A risk for nonspecific renal disease was shown to be significantly higher in the presence of concomitant diseases, such as hypertensive and alcoholic disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic pyelonephritis. The urinary low molecular-weight protein test was demonstrated to be of value in the early diagnosis of renal lesion and in the determination of its pattern. Long-term use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was beneficial in patients with increased urinary albumin excretion. The spectrum of causative agents of urinary tract infection and their sensitivity to antibiotics were studied in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Fluoroquinolones were demonstrated to have some advantage in the treatment of these patients. The authors show it necessary to make a follow-up monitoring of renal function and an adequate therapeutical correction, which may retard the progression of renal abnormalities.",

Chronic renal disease progresses to the end-stage, of which a patient requires dialysis or transplantation, and thus prevention of progression of renal disease to the end-stage is a very important issue. Accumulating data indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is more effective than other antihypertensive drugs for treating chronic renal disease, since in addition to an antihypertensive effect, ACE inhibitor has a renoprotective effect. Although ACE inhibitor is more effective than other antihypertensive drugs, it only prevents the progression of chronic renal disease by less than 50%. Thus, in addition to blockers of the renin-angiotensin system, other types of drugs are required. Chronic renal disease progresses through a common pathway, regardless of the type of initial insult. This common pathway includes direct hemodynamic actions, modulation of glomerular cell injury, growth factor actions and induction of apoptosis. Blockade of this common pathway is one of the drug development strategies for chronic renal disease.", 
    "134": "The crystal structure of the class-B beta-lactamase, BlaB, from the pathogenic bacterium, Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, in complex with the inhibitor, d-captopril, has been solved at 1.5-A resolution. The enzyme has the typical alphabeta/betaalpha metallo-beta-lactamase fold and the characteristic two metal binding sites of members of the subclass B1, in which two Zn2+ ions were identified. d-Captopril, a diastereoisomer of the commercial drug, captopril, acts as an inhibitor by displacing the catalytic hydroxyl ion required for antibiotic hydrolysis and intercalating its sulfhydryl group between the two Zn2+ ions. Interestingly, d-captopril is located on one side of the active site cleft. The x-ray structure of the complex of the closely related enzyme, IMP-1, with a mercaptocarboxylate inhibitor, which also contains a sulfhydryl group bound to the two Zn2+ ions, shows the ligand to be located on the opposite side of the active site cleft. A molecule generated by fusion of these two inhibitors would cover the entire cleft, suggesting an interesting approach to the design of highly specific inhibitors.",

Mean arterial pressure was also decreased in the therapy group compared to increased pressure in the third trimester in the group with no therapy. The incidence of fetal growth restriction and need for labor induction were lower in the diltiazem-treated group.",

    "139": "Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal failure in the Western world. It accounts for 15-25% of all renal failure in patients requiring chronic dialysis. About 20% of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and less than 15% of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes develop clinically significant nephropathy. The prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in pregnant patients with insulin-dependent diabetes is estimated to be 6%. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the drug of choice in treating women with diabetic nephropathy. In addition, many of these drugs may be started before conception. Unfortunately, these agents might be fetotoxic when taken during pregnancy. This article reviews the epidemiology and natural history of diabetic nephropathy, discusses the renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors, reviews the effect of ACE inhibitors on fetomaternal outcome when used prior to and during pregnancy in women with diabetic nephropathy and discusses the new class of drugs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, in the management of diabetics who have or are prone to developing diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "140": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat diverse inflammatory diseases because of their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX), which constitutes the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic cascade of prostaglandin (PG). However, NSAID therapy is associated with adverse changes in renal function. Most prominent are changes in electrolyte homeostasis and impaired renal perfusion. PGs such as PGE2, PGF2a, and PGI2 (prostacyclin) modulate many renal physiologic effects, including renal haemodynamics and renal tubular function. Consequently, one would anticipate that impairment of the synthesis of such PGs would adversely affect renal function. About one fourth of NSAID-treated patients have sodium retention, regardless of the type of NSAID being used. NSAID therapy may also cause blood pressure destabilization. This destabilization is attributable to the well defined ability of NSAIDs to attenuate the antihypertensive effects of several agents including diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Because an estimated 14 million Americans are treated with both anti-hypertensive drugs and NSAIDs, the public health implications are clear. Finally, NSAIDs may occasionally produce acute renal failure. The pathogenesis is believed to be renal vasoconstriction secondary to inhibition of vasodilatory PGs with unopposed vasoconstrictor forces including angiotensin II, catecholamines and enhanced sympathetic activity.", 
    "141": "In adult mammalian kidney, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is found in restricted subpopulations of cells. High levels of expression can be detected in the macula densa (MD) and associated cortical thick ascending limb of Henle (cTALH) cells and medullary interstitial cells (MICs). In human biopsy specimens, COX-2 expression is also detected in glomerular podocytes and increased podocyte expression is seen in experimental models of progressive glomerular injury. Physiological regulation of COX-2 in these cellular compartments suggests functional roles for eicosanoid products of the enzyme. COX-2 expression increases in high-renin states (salt restriction, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, renovascular hypertension) and selective COX-2 inhibitors significantly decrease plasma renin levels, renal renin activity and mRNA expression. There is evidence for negative regulation of MD/cTALH COX-2 by angiotensin II and by glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Conversely, nitric oxide (NO) generated by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is a positive modulator of COX-2 expression. Decreased extracellular chloride increases COX-2 expression in cultured cTALH, an effect mediated by increased p38 MAP kinase activity and, in vivo, a sodium-deficient diet increases expression of activated p38 in MD/cTALH. In contrast to COX-2 in MD/cTALH, COX-2 expression in MICs increases in response to a high-salt diet, as well as water deprivation. Studies in cultured MICs confirm that expression is increased in response to hypertonicity, and expression is mediated at least in part by nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) activation. COX-2 inhibition leads to apoptosis of MICs in response to hypertonicity in vitro and following water deprivation in vivo. In addition, COX-2 metabolites appear to be important mediators of medullary blood flow and renal salt handling. Therefore, there is increasing evidence that COX-2 is an important physiological mediator of kidney function.", 
    "142": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is associated with unsatisfactory outcomes in patients with hypertension and heart failure in that activation of this system is correlated strongly with both the incidence and extent of end-organ damage. Despite the availability of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), unblocked aldosterone levels remain an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease progression. New preclinical data generated over the last few years strongly supports the hypothesis that aldosterone has important deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system independent of the classical action of this hormone on renal epithelial cells. The new selective aldosterone blocker, eplerenone, has been shown to produce significant cardioprotective and renoprotecive effects in experimental models of cardiovascular disease. Early clinical studies suggests that eplerenone may have important therapeutic benefit in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure post-myocardial infarction (post-MI).", 
    "143": "The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) compared four antihypertensive agents in patients 55 years and older: chlorthalidone, doxazosin, amlodipine, and lisinopril. The doxazosin arm was terminated early because of an excess of congestive heart failure. Chlorthalidone was at least equivalent to amlodipine and lisinopril in all of the outcomes measured, and was better in some, notably heart failure.", 
    "144": "Hyperglycemia predisposes to organ damages, particularly to nephropathy, via various and complex interrelated pathogenetic mechanisms, that is the well reported proteic glycosylation, vasoactive substances production, oxidative stress, and in particular renin-angiotensin system modulation. Genetic variability plays an important role in determining the response of patients with diabetes on these mechanisms. The analysis of physiopathogenic mechanisms underlying diabetic nephropathy brings evidence that ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists have a protective effect not limited to the blood pressure-lowering effect.", 
    "145": "In vascular tissues, angiotensin II is potentially cleaved from angiotensin I by chymase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Chymase is stored in mast cells and has no enzymatic activity in the normal state. Chymase is activated immediately upon its release into the extracellular matrix in vascular tissues after mast cells have been activated by stimuli such as vessel injury by grafting or a balloon catheter. In dog grafted veins, chymase activity is increased, and the vascular proliferation is suppressed by either a chymase inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker. After balloon injury in dog vessels, chymase activity is locally increased in the injured artery, and a chymase inhibitor is effective in preventing the vascular proliferation, but an ACE inhibitor is ineffective. Chymase plays an important role in the development of vascular proliferation via the induction of local angiotensin II formation in injured vessels. (c) 2002 Prous Science. All rights reserved.", 
    "146": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is frequently activated in patients with chronic liver diseases. Angiotensin-II (AT-II), which is produced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), has many physiological effects, including strong pro-angiogenic activity. AT-II induces the potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Recent studies have revealed that angiogenesis is an essential process in many pathological events, such as tumor growth including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and even in liver fibrogenesis. ACE inhibitors are currently widely used as anti-hypertensive agents in clinical practice. Studies have found that the ACE inhibitor, perindopril (PE), which is a potent inhibitor of experimental HCC growth and angiogenesis, is associated with the suppression of VEGF at a clinically comparable dose. PE also markedly suppressed the hepatocarcinogenesis step. In liver fibrogenesis, AT-II is known to stimulate proliferation and production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSC), which play a pivotal role in liver fibrosis development. PE markedly inhibited liver fibrogenesis associated with suppression of Ac-HSC proliferation and TIMP-1 expression via protein kinase-C, which serves as an intracellular signaling pathway. Since ACE inhibitor is used widely in clinical practice without serious side effects, it may provide an alternative new strategy for the treatment of liver fibrosis and HCC.", 
    "147": "We examined the regulation/expression of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors in the transgenic (TG) (mRen-2)27 rat compared to the normal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat. Ang II receptor binding and mRNA expression were determined by quantitative autoradiography and real-time PCR, respectively. Ang II receptors in the rat prostate rat were of the AT(1) receptor subtype and were significantly reduced in the prostate of the TG rat compared to the normal SD rat. However, AT(1) receptor binding was significantly higher in the prostate of the TG rat treated with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril compared to the untreated TG rat and comparable to the control SD rat. In contrast to the protein, AT(1) receptor mRNA expression was not reduced in the prostate of the TG rat compared to the SD rat. However, AT(1) receptor mRNA was markedly reduced in the prostate of the lisinopril-treated TG rat compared to the untreated TG rat or control SD rat. In conclusion, the findings suggest that AT(1) receptors are present in the rat prostate at a protein level and are subject to down-regulation in the TG rat which may be due to receptor internalisation as a consequence of receptor hyper-stimulation by increased local tissue levels of Ang II. Moreover, AT(1) receptor protein and mRNA expression in the prostate may be inversely modulated.", 
    "148": "Emerging data have provided evidence for the presence of a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the pancreas, which play a role in the regulation of pancreatic microcirculation, thus affecting islet hormonal secretion. The present study aimed, therefore, at elucidating the presence and changes of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a specific assay for ACE activity using the internally quenched fluorogenic substrate Meoc-DL-Amp-Gly-Lys(epsilon -DNP)-Gln-OH. RT-PCR clearly demonstrated the expression of ACE mRNA in the pancreas. ACE activity was markedly and significantly increased by chronic hypoxia and by acute pancreatitis when compared with that of their respective control pancreas. Addition of captopril, a specific inhibitor for ACE, completely blocked the ACE activity both in the control and experimental groups. All these data suggest that increased activity of pancreatic ACE in chronic hypoxia and acute pancreatitis could have implications for pancreatic physiology and pathophysiology.", 
    "149": "Circulating angiotensin (Ang) II has well-known endocrine properties in the cardiovasculature. AngII, produced de novo within the heart, has various autocrine and paracrine properties on resident cells expressed via AT(1) receptor-ligand binding. Herein, we review the heart's renin-angiotensin system and its role in connective tissue turnover involving heart valve leaflets and fibrous tissue that appears at sites of injury, such as following myocardial infarction.", 
    "150": "The classical view of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as a circulating endocrine system has evolved to organ- and tissue-based systems that perform paracrine/autocrine functions. Angiotensin II (Ang II), the dominant effector peptide of the RAS, regulates cellular growth in a wide variety of tissues in (patho)biological states. In 1996, we hypothesized that there exists a locally active RAS in the bone marrow affecting the growth, production, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Evidences supporting this hypothesis are growing. Ang II, through interacting with Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor stimulates erythroid differentiation. This stimulatory effect of Ang II on erythropoiesis was completely abolished by a specific AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan. AT1a receptors are present on human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells. Ang II increases hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and this effect was also blocked by losartan. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in enhancing the recruitment of primitive stem cells into S-phase in hematopoietic bone marrow by degrading tetrapeptide AcSDKP. ACE inhibitors modified the circulating hematopoietic progenitors in healthy subjects. RAS may also affect pathological/neoplastic hematopoiesis. Renin has been isolated from leukemic blast cells. Higher bone marrow ACE levels in acute leukemic patients suggested that ACE is produced at higher quantities in the leukemic bone marrow. In this review, the 'State of the Art' of the local bone marrow RAS is summarized. A local RAS in the bone marrow can mediate, in an autocrine/paracrine fashion, some of the principal steps of hematopoietic cell production. To show a causal link between the components of RAS and the other regulatory hematopoietic growth factors is not only an academic curiosity. Elucidation of such a local bone marrow system may offer novel therapeutic approaches in pathologic/neoplastic conditions.", 
    "151": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is currently the focus of intense cardiovascular research, with the resultant rapid evolution of novel concepts relating to its exceedingly complex pathophysiology. In addition to the alterations in signal transduction and disturbances in Ca(2+) homeostasis, there are structural changes in myofilaments, disorganization of the cytoskeletal framework and increased collagen synthesis. LVH is associated with progressive left ventricular remodeling that culminates to heart failure. The modern treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy is now largely based on the hypothesis that neuroendocrine activation is important in the progression of the disease and inhibition of neurohormones is likely to have long-term benefit with regard to morbidity and mortality. Drugs specifically designed to unload the left ventricle, such as diuretics and vasodilators, appears to be less effective in reducing LV mass and improving prognosis. Thus, the evolution of treatment for LVH itself has provided much enlightenment for our understanding of the fundamental biology of the disorder.", 
    "152": "The beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors in hypertension and heart failure may relate, at least in part, to their capacity to interfere with bradykinin metabolism. In addition, recent studies have provided evidence for bradykinin-potentiating effects of ACE inhibitors that are independent of bradykinin hydrolysis, i.e. ACE-bradykinin type 2 (B(2)) receptor 'cross-talk', resulting in B(2) receptor upregulation and/or more efficient activation of signal transduction pathways, as well as direct activation of bradykinin type 1 receptors by ACE inhibitors. This review critically reviews the current evidence for hydrolysis-independent bradykinin potentiation by ACE inhibitors, evaluating not only the many studies that have been performed with ACE-resistant bradykinin analogues, but also paying attention to angiotensin-(1-7), a metabolite of both angiotensin I and II, that could act as an endogenous ACE inhibitor. The levels of angiotensin-(1-7) are increased during ACE inhibition, and most studies suggest that its hypotensive effects are mediated in a bradykinin-dependent manner.", 
    "153": "The concept of local renin-angiotensin systems has been introduced almost 20 years ago to explain the beneficial blood pressure-independent effects of ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists in cardiovascular diseases. In the past decade, research has focussed on the local effects of angiotensin II rather than on the mechanism(s) of its local generation. This review addresses several of the unanswered questions with regard to tissue angiotensin II generation, focussing in particular on the heart and vascular wall: (1) what is the origin of the renin that is required to generate angiotensin II locally, (2) where does tissue angiotensin generation occur (intra- versus extracellular), (3) what is the importance of alternative (non-renin, non-ACE) angiotensin-generating enzymes, (4) do ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists exert local effects that are renin-angiotensin system independent (thereby incorrectly leading to the conclusion that they interfere with the local generation or effects of angiotensin II), and (5) to what degree do differences in tissue angiotensin generation underlie the association between cardiovascular diseases and renin-angiotensin system gene polymorphisms?",

Statins are needed to treat dyslipidaemia. They also lower blood pressure and have a synergistic effect with the above two antihypertensive components in lowering blood pressure. In hypertensive patients, risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications is determined by the blood pressure level and the presence or absence of target organ damage and the interaction with other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes.

The present study was performed to investigate the effect of long-term treatment with angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonists (L-158,809 and olmesartan), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (temocapril) and hydralazine on levels of CGRP mRNA in DRG of SHR and the contents of CGRP in the mesenteric artery and atrium. The level of CGRP mRNA and degree of CGRP-like immunoreactivities (CGRP-LI) were measured by Northern blot hybridization assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Seven week-treatment of 8 week-old SHR with temocapril (0.005%), L-158,809 (0.001%), olmesartan (0.01%) or hydralazine (0.01%) administered in drinking water significantly lowered the systolic blood pressure of SHR. The level of CGRP mRNA in the DRG of control SHR was significantly lower than that in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), whereas the level of CGRP-LI in the mesenteric artery and atrium of SHR were significantly greater than those in WKY. Treatment of SHR with temocapril, L-158,809, or olmesartan, but not hydralazine, significantly elevated the levels of CGRP mRNA in DRG, markedly increased the level of CGRP-LI in the mesenteric artery, and slightly increased the CGRP-LI level in the atrium. These results suggest that long-term inhibition of angiotensin II restores the reduced expression of CGRP mRNA in DRG and may facilitate neurotransmission of CGRP-containing vasodilator nerves in SHR.",

Lisinopril significantly reduced serum ACE activity but it did not affect pancreatic activity.

The authors developed an inpatient disease management program for CHF in a community hospital setting to determine if it is possible to: 1) increase implementation of Agency for Health Care Policy and Research criteria for CHF; 2) improve the quality of patient care, while lowering length of stay and treatment cost for CHF; and 3) maintain nursing staff satisfaction. The program encompassed a clinical pathway incorporating Agency for Health Care Policy and Research criteria for CHF, CHF education, and patient educational materials. When compared to \"unmanaged\" patients (n=197) not participating in the algorithm due to physician choice, \"managed\" patients (n=396) had significantly increased documentation of left ventricular dysfunction and of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use. In contrast to unmanaged patients, managed patients had a significantly lower length of stay (3.9+/-2.2 vs. 6.1+/-2.8 days; p<0.0001) with a significant reduction in cost per patient ($4404+/-$1989 vs. $6828+/-$3347; p<0.0001). These changes were sustained in follow-up over 1 year and were associated with an improvement in nursing staff education and nursing care.

The etiology is unclear, but very high renin levels are present. While scleroderma is more common in women and whites, there is no difference in the prevalence of scleroderma renal crisis by gender. However, there appears to be a higher prevalence of scleroderma renal crisis among African Americans than whites. Survival was dismal prior to the introduction of the vigorous treatment of hypertension and use of converting-enzyme inhibitors. However, most data on the benefit of these medications are derived from uncontrolled and unblinded studies. Prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the role of angiotensin receptor blockers. Prevention trials could define the role of various drugs in decreasing the rate of scleroderma renal crisis.",

Of note, there was no difference between the 92 mm Hg or less (lower group) and the 102-107 mm Hg (usual) mean arterial pressure groups as regards the secondary clinical composite end point. The secondary clinical composite end point in this study comprised a threshold drop of at least 50% or 25 mL/min in glomerular filtration rate, death, or reaching end-stage renal disease. The final results from this study would suggest that reduction in blood pressure to levels below those currently advocated for cardiovascular risk reduction, although a clearly attainable goal in this population, does not provide readily identifiable benefits to African Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Importantly, this study provides the basis for the primary use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in an African American population with the characteristics of those studied in AASK. It remains to be determined if this represents a class effect for all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists (AIIAs) control blood pressure as well as other available classes of antihypertensive drugs. The ACE inhibitors have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, reverse left ventricular hypertrophy, and improve congestive heart failure symptomatology and mortality to a similar degree as diuretics and beta-adrenergic blockers. ACE inhibitors reduce postmyocardial infarction recurrence, improve congestive heart failure symptomatology and mortality, and slow the progression of glomerular renal disease. The AIIAs reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Several of these agents have been shown to improve congestive heart failure symptomology and mortality, to reduce the occurrence of early atherosclerotic vascular disease, and to slow the progression of renal failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus nephropathy. One AIIA has reduced the incidence of end-stage renal disease in non-insulin-dependence diabetes mellitus nephropathy over 3 years. Ideally, antihypertensive therapy should maintain or improve the patients quality of life without creating side effects or adverse laboratory effects. Among the available nine classes of antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors and the AIIAs come close to meeting the description of an ideal drug. AIIAs and ACE inhibitors, two classes of antihypertensive drugs that reduce the activity of the renin-angiotensin II system, should be among the preferred first-step drugs for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "211": "In 1997, national recommendations for the treatment of hypertension were made in the form of the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI). African American hypertensives are considered a special population with a higher prevalence of hypertension, and therefore, unique treatment needs. The study objective was to review medication use among an African American and Latino urban population in relation to the JNC recommendations. The study population was drawn from a preexisting cohort of African Americans and Latinos. Records were reviewed for self-description of hypertension and the use of any antihypertensive medication in individuals less than 60 years of age. A small subgroup of individuals was separately reviewed for specific medications used to treat hypertension. There were 34,118 individuals in the cohort greater than 45 years of age and less than 60 years of age that qualified for review; 40% were African American and 60% were Latino. Of the 13,593 African Americans, 6387 (47%) were hypertensive. Of the 20,525 Latinos, 29% were hypertensive. Only 56% of all hypertensives were on some blood pressure medication (61% of the African Americans and 48% of the Latinos). Within the subgroup of 550 individuals with detailed medication information (223 African Americans and 327 Latinos), calcium channel blockers and diuretics were the most frequently used medication among the African Americans and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most frequently used medication among the Latinos. Beta blockers were used only 13% of the time. The authors concluded that in this cohort of hypertensive urban Latinos and African Americans, more than 40% of individuals were not being treated for hypertension and, despite the guidelines suggested in JNC VI, few individuals were being treated for their hypertension with diuretic monotherapy or beta blockers as first-choice drugs. Instead there was extensive use of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "212": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, which cleaves dipeptides and, in some instances, dipeptide or tripeptide amides from the C-terminus of regulatory peptides (e.g. angiotensin I, bradykinin and substance P). The expression of ACE is highly regulated in insects, where it is thought to have a role in the metabolism of peptide hormones involved in regulating reproduction. After a blood meal, ACE activity in the female mosquito Anopheles stephensi, increases four-fold with much of the enzyme finally accumulating in the ovary. In the present study, we have studied the effect on reproduction of adding two selective inhibitors of ACE, captopril and lisinopril, to the blood meal. Both ACE inhibitors reduced the size of the batch of eggs laid by females in a dose-dependent manner, with no observable effects on the behaviour of the adult insect. The almost total failure to lay eggs after feeding on either 1 mM captopril or 1 mM lisinopril, did not result from interference with the development of the primary follicle, but was due to the inhibition of egg-laying. Since very similar effects on the size of the egg-batch were observed with two selective ACE inhibitors, belonging to different chemical classes, we suggest that these effects are mediated by the selective inhibition of the induced mosquito ACE, a peptidase probably involved in the activation/inactivation of a peptide regulating egg-laying activity in A. stephensi.",

    "217": "In managing atrial fibrillation (AF), the main therapeutic strategies include rate control, termination of the arrhythmia, and the prevention of recurrences and thromboembolic events. Safety and efficacy considerations are important in optimizing the choice of an antiarrhythmic drug for the treatment of AF. Recently approved antiarrhythmics, such as dofetilide, and promising investigational drugs, such as azimilide and dronedarone, may change the treatment landscape for AF. For medical conversion of recent-onset AF, class IC antiarrhythmic drugs, administered as an oral bolus, have been demonstrated to be the most efficacious pharmacologic conversion agents. Intravenous ibutilide and oral dofetilide both have efficacies superior to placebo in controlled trials for converting persistent AF. Comparative trials in paroxysmal AF have demonstrated that flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, and sotalol are equally effective in preventing recurrences of AF. Amiodarone has been demonstrated to be more efficacious than propafenone or sotalol in the Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation. In persistent AF, twice-daily dofetilide has been shown to be as or more effective than low-dose sotalol given twice daily for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. Trials have demonstrated that subjective adverse effects are less frequent with class IC drugs, sotalol, and dofetilide compared with such drugs as quinidine. In patients without structural heart disease, flecainide, propafenone, and D,L-sotalol are the initial drugs of choice, given their reasonable efficacy, low incidence of subjective side effects, and lack of significant end-organ toxicity. Treating AF in patients with left ventricular dysfunction can be difficult because of associated electrophysiologic derangements, potential proarrhythmic concerns, and negative inotropic effects of antiarrhythmics. Some data exist suggesting that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can prevent AF either by preventing atrial dilation and stretch-induced arrhythmias or by blocking the renin-angiotensin system. In post-myocardial infarction patients, D,L-sotalol, dofetilide, and amiodarone-and in congestive heart failure patients, amiodarone and dofetilide-have demonstrated neutral effects on survival in controlled trials. In the Congestive Heart Failure Survival Trial of Antiarrhythmic Therapy (CHF-STAT), amiodarone lowered the frequency of AF development and improved left ventricular ejection fraction over time. In CHF-STAT, there was lower mortality in patients who converted from AF to sinus rhythm. Dofetilide decreased rehospitalization for congestive heart failure in the Danish Investigations of Arrhythmia and Mortality on Dofetilide (DIAMOND) trials. Neutral effects on survival and favorable hemodynamics have positioned amiodarone and dofetilide as the antiarrhythmics of choice in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. In post-myocardial infarction patients, sotalol is an additional agent to consider for treatment of AF in this setting.", 
    "218": "Pharmacologic clinical trials in heart failure (HF) have provided substantial advances in effective treatment of this condition, moving us from our focus on short-term symptom relief to an expectation of substantial improvement in long-term clinical outcomes for our patients. Based on an appreciation of the importance of neurohormonal activation in the pathophysiology of HF, clinical trials have demonstrated the value of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers in impeding the progression of HF and in reducing morbidity and mortality for patients with this condition. Clinical trials have further demonstrated the benefits of digoxin in improving symptoms and reducing hospitalization frequency, as well as in aldosterone blockade, at least in patients with severe symptoms. Given the ethical imperative to treat with ACE inhibitors, the angiotensin receptor antagonists have been difficult to study; nevertheless, their value is becoming increasingly clear, particularly for patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Trials with several classes of newer agents-cytokine antagonists, endothelin receptor blockers, and vasopeptidase inhibitors-have recently yielded disappointing results. Early results with vasopressin receptor antagonists provide some promise of long-term benefit. Clinical trials have provided significant treatment advances; ongoing and future trials will demonstrate the degree to which we can improve on what we have achieved to date with pharmacologic treatments.",

However, ACE inhibitor treatment, which could have compensated for negative effects of the D/D form of the ACE gene polymorphism, was not considered in the studies. We investigated the influence of the ACE-I/D polymorphism and the ACE inhibitor treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus on the occurrence of CHD by multiple-regression analysis. Distribution of the ACE gene I/D-polymorphism was investigated in 691 patients with diabetes mellitus prospectively characterised for the presence/absence of coronary heart disease. The distribution of DD; ID; II genotypes was 105 vs. 202 vs. 102 (25.7 % vs. 49.4 % vs. 24.9) in the CHD + group and 55 vs. 160 vs. 67 (19.5 % vs. 56.7 % vs. 23.8 %) in the CHD - group, respectively (p = 0.1). A multiple logistic regression analysis introducing the typical risk factors for CHD (age, gender, smoking, BMI > 26 kg/m 2, LDL elevation, HbA1c > 7 %) could not identify the ACE gene I/D-polymorphism as an independent risk factor for CHD (p = 0.87). Our data therefore suggest that the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is not associated with the occurrence of diabetic macroangiopathy in patients with or without treatment of ACE inhibitors.",

We have recently shown, using this model, that mice lacking the bradykinin B2-receptor (B2(-/-)) were more susceptible than control animals to the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition slows down UUO-induced renal fibrosis. Since ACE-inhibition increases bradykinin and decreases angiotensin II concentrations we have verified if bradykinin is involved in the antifibrotic effects of ACE-inhibition using the UUO-model and B2(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, although ACE-inhibition significantly reduced renal fibrosis, no difference was observed between the degree of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, macrophage infiltration and cell proliferation between ACE-inhibitor treated B2(+/+) and B2(-/-) mice suggesting the absence of a role of the B2-receptor in the antifibrotic effects of ACE-inhibition. This was confirmed at the level of bradykinin-induced activity of enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix.

The active metabolite, trandolaprilat, has been found to have a high level of affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme. Trandolapril has demonstrated potent ACE inhibition, a long plasma half-life and a high degree of lipophilicity. The drug has been used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and congestive heart failure following myocardial infarction. In the former patients, a once-daily dosage of trandolapril has produced significant and long-lasting reductions in blood pressure and has reduced left ventricular hypertrophy. Trandolapril is one of a few ACE inhibitors with a mean trough:peak ratio of blood pressure reduction with once-daily administration of over 50%. In addition, studies in hypertensive patients have revealed still greater reductions in blood pressure when trandolapril is combined with the calcium antagonist verapamil. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, the large TRACE trial showed that mortality was reduced and life expectancy increased with trandolapril treatment.", 
    "231": "d- and l-captopril are competitive inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases. For the enzymes from Bacillus cereus (BcII) and Aeromonas hydrophila (CphA), we found that the mononuclear enzymes are the favored targets for inhibition. By combining results from extended x-ray absorption fine structure, perturbed angular correlation of gamma-rays spectroscopy, and a study of metal ion binding, we derived that for Cd(II)1-BcII, the thiolate sulfur of d-captopril binds to the metal ion located at the site defined by three histidine ligand residues. This is also the case for the inhibited Co(II)1 and Co(II)2 enzymes as observed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Although the single metal ion in Cd(II)1-BcII is distributed between both available binding sites in both the uninhibited and the inhibited enzyme, Cd(II)1-CphA shows only one defined ligand geometry with the thiolate sulfur coordinating to the metal ion in the site composed of 1 Cys, 1 His, and 1 Asp. CphA shows a strong preference for d-captopril, which is also reflected in a very rigid structure of the complex as determined by perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy. For BcII and CphA, which are representatives of the metallo-beta-lactamase subclasses B1 and B2, we find two different inhibitor binding modes.", 
    "232": "ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) improve insulin resistance and prevent type 2 diabetes, possibly mediated by inhibition of bradykinin (BK) degradation. The vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (OMA) raises BK to a greater extent than ACEIs by dual enzyme inhibition, whereas its insulin-sensitizing effects and mechanisms have not been investigated.", 
    "233": "We compared the insulin-sensitizing effects of OMA, ramipril (an ACEI), losartan (an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker), and placebo by 2-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in insulin-resistant Zucker fatty rats (n=6 to 7 in each group). OMA resulted in a lower rate of endogenous glucose production than placebo at baseline (35+/-5 versus 54+/-4 mmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P<0.01), greater suppression of endogenous glucose production by low-dose insulin (73+/-11% versus 27+/-18%, P<0.05), and greater glucose disposal at high-dose insulin (135+/-5 versus 92+/-4 mmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P<0.01). Ramipril tended to improve insulin sensitivity, but losartan did not. OMA significantly increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake by myocardium, fat, and skeletal muscle. Ramipril increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake only by some skeletal muscles, but losartan did not. The insulin-sensitizing effects of OMA were blocked significantly by HOE-140 (a BK, B2 receptor antagonist) and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) in all tissues except myocardium.", 
    "234": "OMA induces profound insulin sensitization and increases myocardial glucose uptake in Zucker fatty rats. This effect is greater than that of ramipril and probably occurs at least in part via stimulation of the B2 receptor. OMA has the potential for greater type 2 diabetes prevention than ACEI.",

Among angiogenic factors, it has been reported that angiotensin II may contribute to neovascularization. However, it is unknown whether inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system suppresses angiogenesis, especially within the heart. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the angiotensin II receptor type I blocker valsartan on cardiac microvasculature, function, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, and survival in cardiomyopathic hamsters.",

Group E showed significant increases in percent fractional shortening while the capillary density and level of mRNA expression of VEGF were unchanged. The 300-day survival rate was significantly lower in group V (25.0%) but higher in group E (100%) than that of group C (66.7%).", 
    "238": "Therapy with valsartan may have adverse effects on survival rate concomitant with the progression of cardiac remodeling owing to impaired VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Therapy with enalapril has a neutral effect on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, leading to the suppression of cardiac remodeling and an increase in life expectancy.", 
    "239": "Evidence suggests that adrenomedullin (AM) plays a role in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Circulating concentrations of AM are elevated in cardiovascular disease in proportion to the severity of cardiac and hemodynamic impairment. Raised plasma AM levels following acute cardiac injury and in heart failure provide prognostic information on adverse outcomes. In heart failure, elevated circulating AM also identifies patients likely to receive long-term benefit from inclusion of additional anti-failure therapy (carvedilol). Administration of AM in experimental and human heart failure induces reductions in arterial pressure and cardiac filling pressures, and improves cardiac output, in association with inhibition of plasma aldosterone (despite increased renin release) and sustained (or augmented) renal glomerular filtration and sodium excretion. Furthermore, AM in combination with other therapies (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and augmentation of the natriuretic peptides) results in hemodynamic and renal benefits greater than those achieved by the agents separately. Manipulation of the AM system holds promise as a therapeutic strategy in cardiac disease.",

Over 4.6 persons per hundred in the United States alone carry this diagnosis, and it is the cause of death in several hundred thousand patients each year, with a 35% mortality over 5 years. In the last years, have existed important advances in the pharmacological treatment of this disease in it's terminal stages. The increase in the knowledge on the physiopathology of the heart failure, has taken place for the use of new schemes of treatment, where it excels the use of vasoactive amines, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor AT1 antagonists, etc; nevertheless we whereupon that most of these drugs that at the present display a favorable answer to the disease, has the disadvantage of increasing the consumption of oxygen by the own myocardium tissue. Levosimendan has a better profile of security than its predecessors (amrinone and milrinone), improves the haemodynamics parameters of special significant form in the cardiac output, the systolic pressure of the pulmonary artery and the telediastolic pressure of the left ventricle, without significantly increasing the consumption of oxygen by the myocardium.

In addition, clinical trials have clarified that modern transient ischaemic attack management is more complex than in the past, with the addition of newer pharmacological options to the stroke prevention armamentarium. Recent information regarding newer antiplatelet agents is reviewed in this article, along with results of clinical trials pertaining to warfarin in stroke prevention. The evolving role of statins, ACE inhibitors and estrogen replacement is reviewed. Finally, the appropriate use of surgery following transient ischaemic attacks is outlined. Recent studies have shown that many patients will benefit from a multimodal pharmacological approach following transient cerebral ischaemia, and the potential for combination therapy is highlighted.",

Factors related to left ventricular hypertrophy progression or regression in the extremely elderly population including role of antihypertensive therapy, are not well recognized. We conducted a structured retrospective chart review analysis of a cohort of 100 homebound elderly, predominately female African American subjects. All persons had at least two 2-D echocardiograms interpreted by the same cardiologist prior to the initiation of this study. Information was collected on demographics, functional status, comorbid conditions, use of medication, and progression or regression of left ventricle hypertrophy between baseline and follow-up echocardiogram. At baseline and follow-up echocardiogram, 47% (n = 47) and 56% had evidence of hypertrophy, respectively. There was no association between treatment with beta-blocker, calcium channel-blocker, or diuretic therapy, and left ventricular hypertrophy at follow-up echocardiogram. Only angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy was associated with the progression of left ventricular hypertrophy in all subjects. Logistic regression analysis based on all subjects revealed that risk of left ventricular hypertrophy on follow-up echocardiogram was lower with increasing age (OR 0.95, CI 0.904-0.997) and higher with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy (OR 3.27, CI 1.41-7.63). Among subjects with no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline, only the presence of hypertension was associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (OR 4.4, CI 1.19-16.3).

Rats (n = 272) received omapatrilat (20 mg x kg-1x day-1) starting 7 days before MI and continued peri- and post-MI, or no treatment (control). One group of rats had continuous ambulatory ECG and blood pressure recordings started 6 h before MI and continued until 24 h after MI, when survival was evaluated, and the rats were killed, and MI size was evaluated. A second group had left ventricular (LV) remodeling evaluated by echocardiography at 30 days and, at 38 days, had cardiac hemodynamics and morphology done and survival evaluated. Survival 24 h after MI (n = 255) improved with omapatrilat (60% vs. 46% for control; P = 0.0378). Over the next 37 days, there was no further improvement with omapatrilat but the early benefit was sustained. Omapatrilat reduced MI size 24 h after MI (36 +/- 2 vs. 42 +/- 2 mm2 for controls; P = 0.034). Omapatrilat reduced ventricular arrhythmia score 1-12 h after MI. Omapatrilat decreased blood pressure, but not during the first 24 h after MI. Omapatrilat reduced LV diastolic and systolic dimensions and LV and right ventricular weights compared with control large MI, indicating a decrease in reactive hypertrophy. Improvement in cardiac remodeling was accompanied by improved cardiac hemodynamics. Thus this study indicates that pre-, peri-, and post-MI treatment with the VPI omapatrilat is beneficial in survival, ventricular arrhythmias, LV remodeling, and cardiac function.",

However, ceruloplasmin and unknown radical species overlap the same magnetic field as that of HbNO. To reveal the EPR spectrum of HbNO, we then introduced the EPR signal subtraction method, which is based on the computer-assisted subtraction of the digitized EPR spectrum of HbNO-depleted blood from that of sample blood using the software. Rats were treated with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 120 mg. kg-1. day-1) for 1 wk to obtain HbNO-depleted blood. When this method was applied to the analysis of untreated fresh whole blood, the five-coordinate state of HbNO was observed. HbNO concentration in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats was augmented (change in [HbNO] = 1.6-5.5 microM) by infusion of L-arginine (0.2-0.6 g/kg) but not D-arginine. Using this method, we attempted to evaluate the effects of temocapril on HbNO dynamics in an L-NAME-induced rat endothelial dysfunction model. The oral administration of L-NAME for 2 wk induced a serious hypertension, and the HbNO concentration was reduced (change in [HbNO] = 5.7 microM). Coadministration of temocapril dose dependently improved both changes in blood pressure and the systemic HbNO concentration. In this study, we succeeded in measuring the blood HbNO level as an index of NO by the EPR HbNO signal subtraction method. We also demonstrated that temocapril improves abnormalities of NO dynamics in L-NAME-induced endothelial dysfunction rats using the EPR HbNO signal subtraction method.",

A randomized, single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of the combination of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution (HSS) infusion in the treatment of refractory New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV CHF and a normosodic diet during follow-up. Materials and Methods One hundred seven patients (39 women and 68 men, age range 65-90 years) with refractory CHF (NYHA class IV) of different etiologies, who were unresponsive to high oral doses of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, and nitrates, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included an ejection fraction (EF) <35%, serum creatinine level <2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level < or =60 mg/dL, reduced urinary volume, and low natriuresis. The patients were randomized in 2 groups (single-blind). Patients in group 1 (20 women and 33 men) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of furosemide (500-1000 mg) plus HSS (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% NACl) twice a day in 30 minutes. Patients in group 2 (19 women and 35 men) received an IV bolus of furosemide (500-1000 mg) twice a day, without HSS, during a period lasting 6 to 12 days. Both groups received IV KCl (20-40 mEq) to prevent hypokalemia.

However, despite better knowledge and novel pharmaceutical strategies, this disease is still one of the most brutal killers in the Western world. The pathophysiology of CHF is complex, and much of our comprehension revolves strictly around the neurohormonal and mechanical mechanisms involved. It has been suggested that CHF is associated with altered hemostasis, but whether a prothrombotic state contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of the disease is still not well known. The purpose of this review article is to discuss our current knowledge of platelet activation in patients with CHF and the potential role of antiplatelet agents in preventing these hemostatic abnormalities. Clopidogrel is an established medication that reduces the incidence of stroke, myocardial ischemia, or vascular death. It is currently the drug of choice in the prophylaxis of subacute stent thrombosis and postischemic stroke treatment. Promising results of the most resent trials (Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events [CAPRIE] and Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events [CURE]) may expand future indications of this ADP receptor antagonist for prevention of thrombotic complications in the CHF population.

This study tested whether dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with both an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACE-I) and an Angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) is superior to either drug alone in type I diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). A randomized double-blind crossover trial was performed with 8-wk treatment with placebo, 20 mg of benazepril once daily, 80 mg of valsartan once daily, and the combination of 20 mg of benazepril and 80 mg of valsartan. Twenty type I diabetic patients with DN were included. At the end of each treatment period, albuminuria, 24-h BP, and GFR were measured. Eighteen patients completed the study. Placebo values were: albuminuria [mean (95% CI)], 701 (490 to 1002) mg/24 h; BP [mean (SEM)], 144 (4)/79 (2) mmHg, and GFR [mean (SEM)], 82 (7) ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Treatment with benazepril, valsartan, or dual blockade significantly reduced albuminuria and BP compared with placebo. Benazepril and valsartan were equally effective. Dual blockade induced an additional reduction in albuminuria of 43 % (29 to 54 %) compared with any type of monotherapy, and a reduction in systolic BP of 6 (0 to 13) mmHg and 7 (1 to 14) mmHg (versus benazepril and valsartan, respectively) and a reduction of 7 (4 to 10) mmHg diastolic compared with both monotherapies. GFR was reversibly reduced on dual blockade compared with monotherapy and placebo. All treatments were safe and well tolerated. In conclusion, dual blockade of the RAS may offer additional renal and cardiovascular protection in type I diabetic patients with DN.",

Ac-SDKP inhibited TGF-beta1-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and alpha2 (I) collagen mRNA. Ac-SDKP suppressed not only TGF-beta1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation at Ser-465/467 in a dose-dependent manner, but also the nuclear accumulation of receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smad), Smad2 and Smad3. As expected, Ac-SDKP inhibited TGF-beta-responsive Smad-dependent luciferase reporters, 3TP-luc and 4xSBE-luc. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the inhibitory Smad, Smad7, was exported to the cytoplasm from the nucleus by the treatment with Ac-SDKP. These findings provide novel evidence that Ac-SDKP inhibits TGF-beta signal transduction through the suppression of R-Smad activation via nuclear export of Smad7, highlighting an alternative mechanism involved in the reno-protective efficacy of ACE-I.",

Trained surveyors recorded medication history plus demographic and socioeconomic variables, as well as several measurements of blood pressure in the home. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined according to guidelines set forth by the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure. Odds ratios for observing an elevated blood pressure given the patients' medication history, income, insurance coverage, demographic variables, and concomitant disease were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.",

The frequency of drugs (including ACEI, digitalis and diuretic) used was stratified into four degrees accordingly. Development of the CHF was scored with regard to relapse rate and severity of this disease. Stepwise regression analysis was applied to explore the relationship between the scored outcome of CHF and the frequency of individual drug administration. A significant relationship of the scored outcome of CHF to the frequency of ACEI usage but not to digitalis nor to diuretics was found (partial coefficient of the correlation r = 0.42, P = 0.002). It was concluded that the long-term administration of ACEI improves the outcome of CHF in senile patients.",

The results showed that Forsinopril significantly decreased the left ventricular index of both SHR and left ventricle pressure overloading rat. Forsinopril reduced the integral photic density of TGF-beta 1 gene statement from 2.836 +/- 0.314 to 1.91 +/- 0.217 (P < 0.01, n = 8) of SHR rat and from 3.071 +/- 0.456 to 2.376 +/- 0.379 (P < 0.01, n = 8) of left ventricular pressure overloading rat respectively.

    "292": "There is evidence that angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) may interact in an additive or synergistic way during luteal regression. The aim of the study was to investigate real time changes in luteal tissue of angiotensin and endothelin system members in mRNA expression, tissue concentrations, tissue localization, and ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) antagonist application after prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PG) induced (days 8-12) luteal regression in cow. Corpora lutea (CL) were collected by transvaginal ovaryectomy before and 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 64 hr (n = 5/time point) after PG injection. ACE mRNA expression (RT-PCR) increased continuously and peaked at 12, 24 hr; ECE-1 (endothelin converting enzyme) peaked at 12 hr, and both peptides in tissue (Ang II and ET-1) increased significantly and peaked at 24 hr. The expression of receptors for Ang II (AT1R and AT2R) did not change in contrast to ET receptors (ETR-A and ETR-B), which were up-regulated. Localization in tissue revealed very weak staining for Ang II and ET-1 before PG application followed by a clear increase of staining predominantly in large luteal cells, but also in endothelial cells. In two experiments, the attempt was made to block ACE by the antagonist captopril with two different doses. In both experiments with captopril, progesterone levels were not significantly different from controls. Ang II alone seems to be not essential for functional luteolysis in bovine system. In conclusion, the results suggest that both Ang II and ET-1 are in parallel up-regulated during luteal regression and may act as vasoconstrictors during functional luteolysis, but also as apoptosis inducer during functional/structural luteolysis.", 
    "293": "Whether cardiovascular responses to bradykinin are augmented by additional treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonism (ATRA) to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) in congestive heart failure (CHF) is unknown. To clarify the level and functional effects of endogenous bradykinin in CHF with combined ATRA and ACEI, 35 dogs were assigned to the following treatment protocols: 1). rapid ventricular pacing (240 bpm), 2). concomitant ATRA (TCV116, 1.5 mg x kg-1.day-1) and rapid pacing, 3). concomitant ACEI (enalapril 1.9 mg x kg-1.day-1) and rapid pacing, 4). concomitant combined ATRA (TCV116, 0.75 mg x kg-1.day-1) and ACEI (enalapril 0.95 mg x kg-1.day-1) and rapid pacing, and 5). sham-operated control. Plasma bradykinin levels were increased and B(2) receptors were synergistically upregulated in CHF groups treated with combined ATRA and ACEI compared with those treated with ATRA or ACEI alone. HOE-140 (0.3 mg/kg), a bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist, produced an increase in total systemic resistance and a decrease in left ventricular contractility in CHF with combined therapy compared with either monotherapy. Thus, endogenous bradykinin partially contributes to the synergistic improvement of cardiovascular function in CHF with additional treatment with ATRA to ACEI.", 
    "294": "The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of combination therapy using the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor lisinopril and the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nifedipine GITS on the degree and homogeneity of 24-hour blood pressure reduction in essential hypertensive patients. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 51 patients (mean age, 54.4 +/- 9.4 years) with essential hypertension and clinic diastolic blood pressure between 105 and 115 mm Hg were randomized to 4-week treatment with lisinopril (20 mg), nifedipine GITS (30 mg), or their combination according to a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Trough clinic blood pressure and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were measured at the end of the run-in period and after 4 weeks of treatment. In addition to clinic and 24-hour average blood pressure reduction, the trough-to-peak ratio and the smoothness index, a new measure for the homogeneity of blood pressure reduction, were also calculated. Although both lisinopril and nifedipine GITS produced a significant reduction in clinic and 24-hour average blood pressure values, the reduction obtained with the combination was significantly (P < 0.001) greater. Moreover, the combination therapy increased (P < 0.01) the smoothness index as compared with each single drug for both systolic (lisinopril, 1.02; nifedipine GITS, 1.1; combination, 1.76) and diastolic (lisinopril, 0.98; nifedipine GITS, 0.87; combination, 1.54) blood pressure values, whereas trough-to-peak ratio values (expressed as median) for systolic (lisinopril, 0.41; nifedipine GITS, 0.52; combination, 0.55) and diastolic (lisinopril, 0.35; nifedipine GITS, 0.40; combination, 0.49) blood pressure values were not significantly increased by the combination therapy. Thus, antihypertensive treatment with the combination of lisinopril and nifedipine GITS is more effective and balanced over the 24 hours than the combination components administered alone, confirming that the smoothness index is superior to the trough-to-peak ratio in assessing homogeneity of pharmacologic blood pressure reduction.",

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was continuously monitored via radiotelemetry.", 
    "297": "Comparison in the first off-treatment period revealed that RAS inhibitor drugs produced a 16-18% persistent lowering of arterial pressure, whereas the triple therapy induced a 10% lowering of MAP relative to untreated SHR. The drug re-challenge induced a further 9% reduction in the 'off'-treatment level of MAP such that in all treatment groups MAP was reduced by more than 30 mmHg compared with controls.", 
    "298": "This study provides new evidence that combination therapy, not directly targeting the RAS, can be efficacious in persistently reducing MAP off-treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the 6-week treatment with RAS inhibitors induced equivalent persistent changes as a 10-week treatment. That is, the additional 4 weeks of continuous therapy was ineffective in further altering the off-treatment MAP. In contrast, with the intermittent treatment protocol (the 14-week 'drug holiday') a further effect on persistent lowering of MAP was regained. These findings suggest continuous long-term treatment with antihypertensive drugs may not be the most effective means of reversing underlying circulatory abnormalities and that the introduction of a drug holiday may be beneficial.",

Additional animals were treated with a high dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. At the end of each experiment, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded, glomerular matrix expansion was scored histologically, and protein expression of TGF-beta(1), fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was determined in the supernatant of cultured glomeruli.",

Compared with untreated nephritic rats, TGF-beta(1) overexpression was not significantly changed by metoprolol or nebivolol in any dose or treatment period. In contrast, TGF-beta(1) levels were significantly reduced by enalapril both 6 and 12 days after disease induction (-52 and -63%, respectively). The changes in glomerular matrix score, fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 production closely followed expression of TGF-beta(1).",

    "318": "Microalbuminuria in diabetes is a risk factor for early death and an indicator for aggressive blood pressure (BP) lowering. We compared a combination of 2 mg perindopril/0.625 mg indapamide with enalapril monotherapy on albumin excretion rate (AER) in patients with type 2 diabetes, albuminuria, and hypertension in a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group international multicenter study. Four hundred eighty-one patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension (systolic BP > or =140 mm Hg, <180 mm Hg, diastolic BP <110 mm Hg) were randomly assigned (age 59+/-9 years, 77% previously treated for hypertension). Results from 457 patients (intention-to-treat analysis) were available. After a 4-week placebo period, patients with albuminuria >20 and <500 microg/min were randomly assigned to a combination of 2 mg perindopril/0.625 mg indapamide or to 10 mg daily enalapril. After week 12, doses were adjusted on the basis of BP to a maximum of 8 mg perindopril/2.5 mg indapamide or 40 mg enalapril. The main outcome measures were overnight AER and supine BP. Both treatments reduced BP. Perindopril/indapamide treatment resulted in a statistically significant higher fall in both BP (-3.0 [95% CI -5.6, -0.4], P=0.012; systolic BP -1.5 [95% CI -3.0, -0.1] diastolic BP P=0.019) and AER -42% (95% CI -50%, -33%) versus -27% (95% CI -37%, -16%) with enalapril. The greater AER reduction remained significant after adjustment for mean BP. Adverse events were similar in the 2 groups. Thus, first-line treatment with low-dose combination perindopril/indapamide induces a greater decrease in albuminuria than enalapril, partially independent of BP reduction. A BP-independent effect of the combination may increase renal protection.", 
    "319": "The aim of the present study was to compare the antihypertrophic effects of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), vasopeptidase inhibition and calcium channel antagonism on cardiac and vascular hypertrophy in diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were treated with one of the following therapies for 32 weeks: the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (100 mg/kg); the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist valsartan (30 mg/kg); a combination of captopril with valsartan; the vasopeptidase inhibitor mixanpril (100 mg/kg); or the calcium channel antagonist amlodipine (6 mg/kg). Systolic blood pressure and cardiac and mesenteric artery hypertrophy were assessed. Mean systolic blood pressure in diabetic SHR (200+/-5 mmHg) was reduced by captopril (162+/-5 mmHg), valsartan (173+/-5 mmHg), mixanpril (176+/-2 mmHg) and amlodipine (159+/-4 mmHg), and was further reduced by the combination of captopril with valsartan (131+/-5 mmHg). Captopril, valsartan and mixanpril reduced heart and left ventricle weights by approx. 10%. The combination of captopril and valsartan further reduced heart weight (-24%) and left ventricular weight (-29%). Amlodipine did not affect cardiac hypertrophy. Only mixanpril and the combination of captopril and valsartan significantly reduced mesenteric weight. The mesenteric wall/lumen ratio was reduced by all drugs, and to a greater extent by the combination of captopril and valsartan. We conclude that optimizing the blockade of vasoconstrictive pathways such as the RAS, particularly with the combination of ACE inhibition and AT(1) receptor antagonism, is associated with antitrophic effects in the context of diabetes and hypertension. In contrast, calcium channel blockade, despite similar effects on blood pressure, confers less antitrophic effects in the diabetic heart and blood vessels.", 
    "320": "For patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic complications can be devastating. Cardiovascular illness, the major cause of morbidity and mortality among these patients, encompasses macrovascular disease, with heart attacks, strokes, and gangrene; and microvascular disease, with retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy (somatic and autonomic). Macrovascular events occur earlier in individuals with DM than in people without DM, and the underlying pathologies are often more diffuse and severe. Diabetic arteriopathy, which encompasses endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, hypercoagulability, changes in blood flow, and platelet abnormalities, contributes to the early evolution of these events. Efforts are under way to determine interventions that may have the potential to prevent or halt the complications of DM. Tight glucose and blood pressure (BP) control is known to improve the vascular status of patients with DM by varying degrees. Use of anti-inflammatory drugs and lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are also useful. An emerging understanding of the importance of small, dense LDL-C and the anti-inflammatory effects of statins has provided new algorithms for primary prevention of macrovascular disease. Antiplatelet agents have also been shown to be effective in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. In the ideal world every risk factor would be addressed and each person with DM would have excellent glycemic control, low to normal BP, and a low LDL level, and would be taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, together with a statin, aspirin, and clopidogrel. Under these near-perfect conditions, the emerging epidemic of macrovascular disease could be contained. Microvascular disease, however, is a consequence of hyperglycemia. For every 1% reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin it is possible to achieve a 22% to 35% reduction in the microvascular complications. BP control is vital and the liberal use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers to slow the progression of renal disease should drastically reduce the incidence of blindness, dialysis, and amputations. This article provides an overview of prevention of macrovascular disease such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease and microvascular complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in patients with DM.", 
    "321": "Insulin resistance is a characteristic feature of uremia. As long as the hyperinsulinemia adequate to overcome the insulin resistance, glucose tolerance remains normal. In patients destined to develop type 2 diabetes, the beta cell compensatory response declines, and relative, or absolute, insulin deficiency develops. At this point glucose intolerance and eventually frank type 2 diabetes occur. Insulin resistance and concomitant hyperinsulinemia are present irrespective of the type of renal disease. Several studies have confirmed that hemodialysis (HD) treatment significantly improves insulin resistance. Both CAPD and CCPD are shown to improve insulin resistance in uremic patients. Comparing the effect of PD and HD treatment, it was found that the CCPD group has significantly higher insulin sensitivity than the HD group with the CAPD group similar to HD. Treatment of calcium and phosphate disturbances, including vitamin D therapy, significantly reduces insulin resistance in uremia. Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) is an efficient way to increase hematocrit, to reverse cardiovascular problems and to improve insulin sensitivity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to improve insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance in uremic patients. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), the new insulin-sensitizing drugs, provide the proof that pharmacologic treatment of insulin resistance can be of enormous clinical benefit. The great potential of insulin resistance therapy illuminated by the TZDs will continue to catalyze research in this area directed toward the discovery of new insulin-sensitizing agents that work through other mechanisms.",

Predominantly synthesised in the glomerular area of the cortico-adrenal glands, extra adrenal production areas have recently been identified notably in the brain, the heart and the large artery trunks. Aldosterone is activated in the cells by the intracellular mineral corticoid receptor. IN CARDIOVASCULAR-PATHOLOGIES: In chronic heart failure, patients treated with conversion enzyme inhibitor may escape from the renin-angiotensin blockade and this may lead to increased aldosterone plasma levels.

Patients with normal ventricular function at rest, but abnormal response to exercise should be treated for long periods of time with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers. Patients who continue to have depressed LV function have a poor prognosis and require treatment with appropriate medications for the rest of their lives. Pharmacological treatment includes ACE inhibitors, beta-blocking agents, diuretics, digoxin, and anticoagulation. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are used only after delivery because of their teratogenic effects. Patients who fail to recover may require inotropic therapy, intra-aortic balloon pump and left ventricular assist device as needed. Cardiac transplantation should be considered for patients who fail therapy.",

However, the management of pediatric heart failure and heart transplantation has generally been inferred from adult studies. New therapies show great promise for the neurohormonal regulation of heart failure and the ability to control immunosuppression after heart transplantation. Large, randomized, multicenter, controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of these therapies in this population.

    "342": "The MIDW was introduced in May of 2000 with use encouraged in all surviving patients with MI. We calculated a patient discharge score by summing the number of quality indicators (aspirin use, beta-blocker use, ACE-inhibitor use, smoking cessation, lipid-lowering therapy, cardiac rehabilitation referral) and compared documentation of quality indicators at discharge between patients without (Group I, n = 65) and with (Group II, n = 60) the MIDW. Group II was subdivided into those with an incomplete worksheet (Group IIa, n = 26), and those with a completed worksheet (Group IIb, n = 34). Greater documentation of secondary prevention indicators occurred in patients with incomplete and completed discharge forms present. Mean Discharge scores were significantly higher for Group II vs. Group I (4.98 vs. 3.88, p < 0.0001), and Group IIb vs. Group IIa, (5.47 vs. 4.35, p < 0.001).",

Physicians in each hospital obtained from the medical records the observed rate of use of cardiovascular drugs at discharge. The drug use was compared with findings from a corresponding sample drawn in 1993. The main indication for use of the different cardiovascular drugs was recorded for the 1999/2000 sample.",

    "348": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. In Switzerland, heart failure (HF) is one of the ten most common causes of hospitalization in patients older than 65 and the second most common in those over 80 years. 17% of the population in Switzerland is in this age class. The expenditures associated with HF are thus considerable. High doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril in patients with heart failure have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure and for any reason. The objective of the present study was to analyze the economic implications of using high doses of lisinopril in the Swiss health care system setting, both from the societal perspective and from that of the Swiss health insurers.", 
    "349": "Using published data from the ATLAS Trial, we computed the monthly probability of death and of hospital admission for heart failure, ischemic events, other cardiovascular causes and any reason per patient for both arms of the trial. Swiss resource use patterns and Swiss unit costs were used to calculate expected monthly expenditures per patient from the third party payer perspective and from the societal viewpoint. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of our results.", 
    "350": "Expected monthly expenditures from the third party payer perspective are 347 Euro per patient in the low dose group and 319 Euro in the high dose group. This represents expected savings of 28 Euro per patient monthly. Because the public sector pays more than 50% of hospital costs, the savings from the societal viewpoint are greater. Expected monthly costs from the societal perspective are 762 Euro in the low dose group and 670 Euro in the high dose group per patient. This results in expected monthly savings of 92 Euro. Sensitivity analysis shows that the use of high doses of ACE inhibitor lisinopril does not result in higher health care expenditures for the whole system or even savings through a wide variety of practice patterns and unit costs.", 
    "351": "Based on the results of the ATLAS study, high doses of lisinopril are associated with a reduction in the number of hospitalizations for HF and for any reason and with a statistically non-significant reduction in mortality. The additional expenditures incurred because of prescription of high doses are offset by the savings in hospital costs. These are important considerations, given the increasing number of people aged 65 and older in Switzerland, and the prevalence of heart failure in this age group.", 
    "352": "The role of local endogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) in endothelial function in resistance arteries was investigated using rabbit mesenteric resistance arteries. First, the presence of immunoreactive Ang II together with Ang II type-1 receptor (AT1R) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was confirmed in these arteries. In endothelium-intact strips, the AT1R-blocker olmesartan (1 microM) and the ACE-inhibitor temocaprilat (1 microM) each enhanced the ACh (0.03 microM)-induced relaxation during the contraction induced by noradrenaline (NA, 10 microM). Similar effects were obtained using CV-11974 (another AT1R blocker) and enalaprilat (another ACE inhibitor). The nitric-oxide-synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) abolished the above effect of olmesartan. In endothelium-denuded strips, olmesartan enhanced the relaxation induced by the NO donor NOC-7 (10 nM). Olmesartan had no effect on cGMP production (1) in endothelium-intact strips (in the absence or presence of ACh) or (2) in endothelium-denuded strips (in the absence or presence of NOC-7). In beta-escin-skinned strips, 8-bromoguanosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP, 0.01-1 microM) concentration dependently inhibited the contractions induced (a) by 0.3 microM Ca2+ in the presence of NA+GTP and (b) by 0.2 microM Ca2++GTPgammaS. Olmesartan significantly enhanced, while Ang II (0.1 nM) significantly inhibited, the 8-Br-cGMP-induced relaxation. We propose the novel hypothesis that in these arteries, Ang II localized within smooth muscle cells activates AT1Rs and inhibits ACh-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation at least partly by inhibiting the action of cGMP on these cells.",

For example, ideal candidates with and without mental illness were equally likely to receive beta-blockers at the time of discharge (age-adjusted RR 0.92 [0.82, 1.02]). The risk-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for death in patients with mental illness versus those without mental illness within 30 days was 1.00 (0.75, 1.32), and for death within one year was 1.25 (1.00, 1.53).",

Mortality at one year may have been higher, although this finding did not reach statistical significance. These findings are consistent with other studies showing reduced health care disparities in the VA for other vulnerable groups, and suggest that an integrated health care system with few financial barriers to health care access may attenuate some health care disparities. Further work should address how health care organizational features might narrow disparities in health care for vulnerable groups.", 
    "358": "Human immunoglobulin A is represented by two structurally and functionally distinct subclasses: IgA1 and IgA2. IgA1, which is almost exclusively present in the mesangial deposits in IgA nephropathy patients, contains in its hinge region three to five O-lined carbohydrate chains. A fraction of IgA1 molecules in the circulation of IgA nephropathy patients exhibits aberrant glycosylation. As a result of changes in glycosylation, the neoepitopes represented by glycans are exposed and recognized by naturally occurring antibodies with antiglycan specifciities, and immune complexes are generated. The deposits of these immune complexes in the glomerular mesangia elicit inflammatory response known as IgA nephropathy. Epidemiological studies have shown that dominant hematuria, either isolated or combined with mild proteinuria, is the most frequent urinary syndrome in glomerulonephritis. The morphologic finding of this syndrome is most frequently IgA nephropathy. Originally considered a benign disease, IgA nephropathy is now recognized as a frequent cause of chronic renal failure. The progression is signalized by increasing proteinuria and hypertension. Therefore, a control of blood pressure and lowering of proteinuria remain the corner-stones of the treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 blockers may lower both blood pressure and proteinuria and are now increasingly promoted even for treatment of normotensive patients. Steroids are administered to patients with severe proteinuria. High-doses of fish oil seem to slow down the rate of renal failure.",

Left ventricular ejection fraction in the ACE-I(+) group (65.6 +/- 12.5%) was significantly lower than that in the ACE-I(-) group (71.9 +/- 8.9%) (p < 0.01). The actuarial rate of the maintenance of sinus rhythm at 48 months in the ACE-I(+) group (86.5%) was similar to that in the ACE-I(-) group (83.1%).

    "362": "Sampatrilat is a novel vasopeptidase inhibitor that may offer a greater benefit than traditional angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF). The present study was undertaken to determine whether sampatrilat improves hemodynamic function and cardiac remodeling through a direct action on the failing heart in rats with CHF following left coronary artery ligation (CAL). Sampatrilat (30 mg/kg a day) was administered orally to the animals from the 1st to 6th week after the operation. Sampatrilat reduced the mortality of the rats with CAL (20 versus 57% for untreated rats). Treatment with sampatrilat for 5 weeks suppressed tissue ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activities. Sampatrilat did not affect the arterial blood pressure, whereas it attenuated the CAL-induced increases in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, heart weight, and collagen content of the viable left ventricle. To assess the direct effects of sampatrilat on collagen synthesis, we measured the incorporation of [(3)H]proline into cultured cardiac fibroblasts. Sampatrilat at concentrations that inhibited NEP activity in vitro augmented the atrial natriuretic peptide-induced decrease in [(3)H]proline incorporation by the cells. In addition, sampatrilat prevented the angiotensin I-induced increase in [(3)H]proline incorporation, whereas captopril did not. The results suggest that long-term treatment with sampatrilat regresses cardiac remodeling in rats with CAL, which is associated with improvement of hemodynamic function. The mechanism by which sampatrilat improved cardiac remodeling may be attributable to the direct inhibition of cardiac fibrosis, possibly acting through the cardiac natriuretic peptide system.", 
    "363": "It has been recently claimed that the human B1 receptors for kinins bind angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors via a potential zinc-binding domain and are pharmacologically stimulated by these drugs. We verified whether ACE inhibitors stimulate B1 receptors in vitro. The isolated rabbit aorta or mouse stomach responded by negligible contractions to the application of captopril, enalaprilat, or zofenoprilat. The human isolated umbilical vein also failed to respond to enalaprilat. All of these preparations were responsive to the B1 receptor agonists des-Arg9-bradykinin (BK) or Lys-des-Arg9-BK. Furthermore, enalaprilat applied continuously had no significant interaction with the effects of Lys-des-Arg9-BK on the rabbit aorta. Enalaprilat failed to stimulate [3H]arachidonate release, translocate the receptors (confocal microscopy), or stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation (immunoblot) in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the rabbit B1 receptor conjugated to yellow fluorescent protein. The phospho-ERK1/2 content of arterial smooth muscle cells of human or rabbit origin was increased by treatment with Lys-des-Arg9-BK but not with enalaprilat.

    "364": "It is not known how the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) attenuate heart failure (HF) in viable ischemic hearts. To assess HF in a rat coronary stenosis (CS) model, we administered vehicle and quinapril or candesartan (or both) orally for 12 wk. Compared with the sham group, the vehicle group showed impaired myocardial perfusion, impaired coronary endothelial nitric oxide (NO) function in vitro, exhausted myocardial mitochondrial respiration, larger left ventricular (LV) dimensions and lower ejection fraction, lower LV rate of pressure development over time (dP/dt), lower slopes of LV end-systolic pressure-dimension relations (ESPDRs), and increased myocardial fibrosis. Treatment with quinapril or candesartan ameliorated these parameters without modifying the epicardial CS severity. Moreover, their combination maintained similar myocardial perfusion, despite a trend toward lower blood pressure, and showed distinctive neurohumoral modulation, normalized mitochondrial respiration, and increased ESPDR slopes. Thus improved myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve by quinapril or candesartan are the key to alleviate CS-induced HF, and their combination may have a therapeutic significance partly through ameliorated mitochondrial respiration and improved LV systolic function.", 
    "365": "In adult mammalian kidney, COX-2 expression is found in a restricted subpopulation of cells. The two sites of renal COX-2 localization detected in all species to date are the macula densa (MD) and associated cortical thick ascending limb cells (cTALH) and medullary interstitial cells. Physiological regulation of COX-2 in these cellular compartments suggests functional roles for eicosanoid products of the enzyme. In the MD region, COX-2 expression increases in high renin states [salt restriction, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, renovascular hypertension], and selective COX-2 inhibitors significantly decrease plasma renin levels and renal renin activity and mRNA expression. An important role for COX-2-derived prostanoids in regulation of renin expression and secretion has also been determined by using mice with selective genetic deletion of either the COX-1 or COX-2 gene. There is evidence for negative regulation of MD/cTALH COX-2 by angiotensin II and by glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, suggesting that in the kidney, cortical COX-2 expression is regulated in part by alterations in activity of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "366": "Pea and whey protein were fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in monoculture and in combination at 28 and 37 degrees C in order to release angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides. The fermentation products were subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, and the digests of nonfermented samples served as controls. After fermentation, the ACE inhibitory activity (%) increased by 18 to 30% for all treatments, except for the fermentations of whey protein with Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 28 degrees C, where no significant change was observed. After digestion, however, both fermented and nonfermented samples reached maximum ACE inhibitory activity. The whey digests tended to have lower (50%) inhibitory concentrations (IC50; 0.14 to 0.07 mg/ml), hence, higher ACE inhibitory activity, than the pea digests (0.23 to 0.11 mg/ml). The nonfermented whey protein digest showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity of all. For pea protein, the nonfermented sample had the lowest IC50 value. These results suggest that in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was the predominant factor controlling the formation of ACE inhibitory activity, hence, indicating its importance in the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides.",

Such therapy typically includes ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and digoxin. With optimal titration and maintenance strategies, beta-blockers are effective and well tolerated in these patients. It is recommened that all patients with clinically stable mild to moderate chronic heart failure (NYHA class II or III), no contraindications to beta-blocker use, and an LVEF less than 40% should be treated with beta-blockers. Based on the results of recent clinical trials on heart failure, beta-blocker therapy should be initiated at a low dose and slowly tirtrated upward as tolerated. A patient's heart failure should be stable for at least 2 weeks before the dose is adjusted upward. Slow titration facilitates maximal tolerability. In primary care practice, physicians should apply titration strategies and target dosed that have been demonstrated to reduce morbidity and mortality in clinical trials. Although worsening heart failure or other adverse events occur in a minority of patients who take beta-blockers, these effects can be managed by adjusting the dose of ACE inhibitor or diuretic, or both, or by temporarily withholding the beta-clocker. Currently, professional treatment guidelines recommend beta-blocker therapy in combination with ACE inhibitors an diuretics as the standard of care in the treatment of heart failure.",

However, despite extensive investigation, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are not fully understood. Reduction of plasma angiotensin II and inhibition of kininase II have been suggested to contribute to improve insulin sensitivity. Insulin binding was measured at tracer insulin concentration in intact cells with or without captopril treatment. Specific binding, expressed as percent of total insulin added, was not different in control and captopril-treated cells. However, captopril treatment caused an increase in insulin-induced insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation accompanied by an increased association of IRS-1 with phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase), despite no change on insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylation. There was also an increased threonine kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation in captopril-treated cells followed by enhanced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These results indicate that captopril treatment has a direct effect on early phosphorylation events induced by insulin in BC3H-1 myocytes.",

Homocysteine (tHcy) is another and independent cardiovascular risk factor and has been reported to be elevated in patients on antihypertensive therapy. As these studies reported only associations, a preliminary, randomized, prospective treatment study was performed in 40 hypertensive patients. We investigated the major determinants of tHcy concentrations after treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) or captopril: vitamins B6, B12, folic acid, and creatinine and cystatin C as parameters of renal function. A total of 21 Patients were treated with HCT and 19 with captopril, for, respectively, 31 and 29 days. HCT, but not captopril, raised tHcy by 16% (P =.003) and also creatinine and cystatin C (P =.025 and P =.004, respectively). This tHcy increase may offset the desired cardioprotection conferred by lowering the blood pressure.", 
    "375": "Cutaneous neurogenic inflammation is a complex biological response of the host immune system to noxious stimuli. Present evidence suggests that zinc metalloproteases may play an important role in the regulation of neurogenic inflammation by controlling the local availability of neuropeptides, such as substance P (SP), that are capable of initiating or amplifying cutaneous inflammation after release from sensory nerves. To address the hypothesis that the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is capable of modulating skin inflammation, we have analyzed murine allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) using wild-type C57BL/6J (ACE(+/+)) or genetically engineered mice with a heterozygous deletion of somatic ACE (ACE(+/-)). In 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene-sensitized ACE(+/-) mice, ACD was significantly augmented in comparison to ACE(+/+) controls as determined by the degree of ear swelling after exposure to hapten. Likewise, systemic treatment of ACE(+/+) mice with the ACE inhibitor captopril before sensitization or elicitation of ACD significantly augmented the ACD response. In contrast, local damage and neuropeptide depletion of sensory nerves following capsaicin, injection of a bradykinin B(2), or a SP receptor antagonist before sensitization significantly inhibited the augmented effector phase of ACD in mice with functionally absent ACE. However, in contrast to ACD, the response to the irritant croton oil was not significantly altered in ACE(+/-) compared with ACE(+/+) mice. Thus, ACE by degrading bradykinin and SP significantly controls cutaneous inflammatory responses to allergens but not to irritants, which may explain the frequently observed exacerbation of inflammatory skin disease in patients under medication with ACE inhibitors.",

Previously, we demonstrated that HGF stimulated growth of endothelial cells without replication of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and that angiotensin (Ang) II significantly decreased local HGF production in VSMC. Moreover, we also reported that high glucose significantly decreased local vascular HGF production. Therefore, we examined effects of Ang II blockade on vascular HGF expression and endothelial injury in diabetic hypertensive rats. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (quinapril) and an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist (GA-0113) or vehicle was administrated to diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-DM), in whom diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Endothelial function was evaluated by the vasodilator response to acetylcholine, and the expression of vascular HGF and its receptor, c-met, was examined by immunohistochemistry. Both quinapril and GA-0113 significantly improved the vasodilator response to acetylcholine ( P < 0.01), while vehicle did not as compared to untreated normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). We next examined the effects of Ang II blockade on vascular HGF expression in SHR-DM. Importantly, the vascular HGF level was markedly decreased in SHR-DM as compared to WKY, while Ang II blockade by quinapril or GA-0113 significantly increased positive staining for HGF in SHR-DM. Similarly, staining of its specific receptor, c-met, was less in the blood vessels of SHR-DM as compared to WKY. In contrast, Ang II blockade also significantly increased c-met production in SHR-DM. The present data demonstrated the improvement of endothelial dysfunction by Ang II blockade in SHR-SM, accompanied by an increase in vascular HGF and c-met.", 
    "387": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is often associated with the rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, coronary thrombus formation, and abrupt limitation of blood flow, leading to adverse outcomes. Passivation of vulnerable plaque represents a therapeutic concept that has the potential to prevent or limit the magnitude of a new rupture in order to reduce the recurrence or severity of events. Plaque passivation can be defined as a process by which the structure or content of the atherosclerotic plaque is changed to reduce the risk of subsequent rupture and thrombosis. This may be achieved by using strategies that address different components of the plaque or the endothelium. The following factors can affect the susceptibility of plaque to rupture: macrophage infiltration; accumulation of inflammatory cells; paracrine secretion of enzymes that may cause degradation of the fibrous cap of coronary plaque; shear stress; circadian rhythm variation in stress hormone release; and infectious agents. The use of pharmacologic agents to reduce plaque vulnerability by passivation has been explored. Clinical studies demonstrate that lipid-modifying agents (e.g., statins), antiplatelet agents (acetylsalicylic acid, thienopyridines, thianopyridines, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors), and antithrombotic agents (unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin) can reduce the occurrence of acute coronary events in ACS patients. In addition, angiographic studies suggest that statins may also promote regression of atherosclerosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, niacin, and calcium antagonists may also contribute to plaque passivation. This article reviews atherosclerotic plaque development and vulnerability and discusses some clinical studies highlighting the role of plaque passivation in the management of ACS patients.",

A HPLC with UV detection was performed to study the influence of various chromatographic operational conditions on both rotamers separation and elution of enalaprilat as a single peak. In addition nuclear overhauser enhancement difference was used for the identification of the conformers. The isomer ratio integrated from the obtained 1H NMR result were 71.5:28.5 and 76:24 at 298 and 279 K, respectively where the trans was the major form.",

Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (IQR 4, 9) which is comparable to the national average from New Zealand admission databases. Longer than average length of stay, defined as >6 days, was associated with the presence of peripheral congestion, duration of treatment with intravenous diuretic, the development of renal impairment, other acute medical problems at admission, iatrogenic complications during hospital stay, and social problems requiring intervention. Factors independently associated with length of stay in the top quartile (>10 days) on logistic regression included the presence of oedema at admission (OR 10.5), change in weight during stay (OR 1.3), duration of treatment with iv diuretic (OR 7.5), the development of renal impairment (OR 9.8), concurrent respiratory problems requiring specific treatment (OR 3.8), and social problems requiring intervention (OR 6.8).",

For each New York Heart Association severity classification the minimum treatment appropriate for the heart failure severity according to the scientific evidence available at the time of the study (1999) was defined. The proportion of patients treated with each drug increased with increasing severity, with the exception of the beta-blockers. Patients with less severe heart failure were approximately four to eight times more likely to receive evidence-based treatment than those with more severe heart failure.", 
    "400": "To assess pharmacological treatment of heart failure, in relation to the available evidence, it is important to take severity into account. While the number of drugs prescribed increased with increasing severity, the use of evidence-based regimes was lower in patients with more severe heart failure.",

Abnormal oxidative stress may therefore be related to some of the high mortality and morbidity in CHF. The objective of the present prospective open study was to compare the effects of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in relation to oxidative stress and endothelial damage in CHF.", 
    "402": "We studied 66 outpatients with CHF: 46 patients were established on an ACE inhibitor and were then started on a beta-blocker, and 20 patients not previously on ACE-inhibitors were started on lisinopril. Baseline levels of the measured parameters were compared to 22 healthy control subjects.

ACE inhibitor therapy also significantly reduced vWf levels, but failed to have any statistically significant effects on LHP or TAC.", 
    "404": "This pilot study suggests that oxidative stress in CHF may be due to increased free radical production or inefficient free radical clearance by scavengers. beta-Blockers, but not ACE inhibitors, reduced lipid peroxidation in patients with CHF.

    "405": "To determine if B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurement could be useful in determination of functional capacity in patients suffering from chronic heart failure.", 
    "406": "Evaluating functional capacity is a crucial factor in the follow-up of patients with chronic heart failure. There are numerous methods for measuring functional capacity and their relative merits remain under discussion. Clinical classifications are very subjective and other methods are difficult to use in clinical practice.", 
    "407": "We evaluated functional capacity in 151 consecutive patients using the 6-min walk test. All patients were clinically classified using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. We measured BNP plasma levels using a bedside BNP test.",

There was a significant correlation between 6-min walk test performance and BNP plasma levels (R=0.69 P<0.001) and a weaker correlation between BNP and left ventricular ejection fraction (R=0.45 P<0.04). In some patients there was a mismatch between NYHA classification and 6-min walk test performance. In all cases BNP could correct the clinical estimation of functional capacity. When we divided the patients into three sub-groups within each NYHA class, we showed that using BNP could better define functional capacity in patients suffering from chronic heart failure in NYHA classes I to III.", 
    "409": "The measurement of BNP levels thus usefully supplements the clinical examination. The existence of bedside BNP testing methods facilitates its use in routine clinical practice. It also permits easier follow-up of patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "410": "Where shall we place angiotensin receptor blockers in the scheme of the prevention of diabetic nephropathy? Only the results of a large, randomized double-blind trial with a comparable and appropriate alternative would prove therapeutic efficacy. The results of several trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have proven them to be the standard of care for diabetics and their kidneys. As reviewed in this article, the results of three large such clinical trials have recently been completed with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Initial results appear favorable. However, whether angiotensin blockers have more to offer than ACE inhibitors is still speculative. The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Since alternative pathways to ACE have been uncovered in the formation of angiotensin II, inhibition at the final end point would provide favored blockade. Because angiotensin receptor blockers do provide this specific blockade, they offer far more promise than ACE inhibitors.", 
    "411": "Cardiovascular disease is responsible for 70% of the deaths in diabetes mellitus. Endothelial dysfunction occurs early in atherosclerosis and can now be assessed accurately and reproducibly by noninvasive means. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, microvascular complications, and coexistent conditions have been shown to impair endothelial function in diabetes. Resistance to insulin's vasodilatory effect and increased free radical generation are probable mechanisms responsible for the endothelial dysfunction in this state. Improvement in glycemic control, insulin and insulin sensitizers, cholesterol lowering, hypolipidemic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers have improved clinical cardiovascular outcomes and have also been shown to improve endothelial function. Strategies designed to assess and improve endothelial function may be further beneficial in terms of cardiovascular outcomes in diabetes mellitus, and need to be tested in a clinical setting.", 
    "412": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major determining factor of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetic patients. Hypertension, which accompanies diabetes in more than 70% of cases, contributes to increased prevalence of CVD events in this group of patients. Results from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) indicated that reduction of elevated blood pressure might decrease CVD morbidity and mortality more than reduction of hyperglycemia. Activation of circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) contributes to the development of both hypertension and insulin resistance in patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome may improve insulin action as well as lessen CVD. In clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have been shown to be more efficient than other antihypertensive medications (i.e., calcium channel blockers) in the reduction of CVD morbidity and mortality in hypertensive diabetics. In this article, we summarize possible mechanisms by which ACE inhibition may improve insulin resistance, coagulation/clotting, and vascular function abnormalities, and postpone or even prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in hypertensive patients.", 
    "413": "Experimental and epidemiologic studies support the role of inflammation in the development of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Serum levels of inflammatory markers, in particular highly sensitive C-reactive protein, have been found to be strong predictors of increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease independent of traditional risk factors. A beneficial effect of thiazolidinediones, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins in the prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events has recently been reported, and potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action for these compounds have been described. Prospective, randomized clinical trials are currently underway to confirm these initial findings and define indications for treatment of patients at risk.", 
    "414": "Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States. The majority of these cases are attributed to those with type 2 diabetes. Elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, and increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) play a major role in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease attributed to diabetes mellitus. Moreover, drugs that inhibit angiotensin II synthesis or block the angiotensin II type I receptor lower blood pressure, reduce proteinuria, and improve outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease caused by diabetes. This article highlights improvements in the current management of diabetic nephropathy afforded by agents that inhibit the RAAS, discusses their limitations, and considers novel strategies to prevent onset and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Current opinions concerning combination drug therapy with agents that block the RAAS at multiple sites, as well as combining calcium channel blockers with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, are also discussed.", 
    "415": "In nondiabetic individuals, a poor response to an endothelium-dependent vasodilator in coronary vessels has been shown to increase the likelihood of a future cardiovascular event. Such prospective data are not as yet available in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, consistent with the greatly increased cardiovascular risk in these patients, endothelial dysfunction has been almost universally found to characterize patients with type 2 diabetes particularly. Endothelial dysfunction frequently coexists with features of insulin resistance, such as the presence of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles even in nondiabetic individuals. This association is independent of obesity and other causes of endothelial dysfunction, such as LDL cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking. In patients with type 1 diabetes, endothelial dysfunction has been found in approximately half of the studies. In some but not all studies, endothelial dysfunction has been especially severe in patients with poor glycemic control. Reversal or amelioration of endothelial dysfunction has been documented by many commonly used therapeutic agents such as successful insulin therapy, fibrates, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but also with some but not all agents that act as antioxidants. Long-term studies addressing the prognostic significance of endothelial dysfunction and its reversal are urgently needed to determine whether measurement of endothelial function could be used to identify individuals at risk better than can be done at present using classic risk factor assessment among patients with type 2 diabetes especially.", 
    "416": "Strategies that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, reduce cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity in high-risk persons such as those with the insulin resistance syndrome and diabetes mellitus. In the 1980s emphasis was placed on the renal protective effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with diabetes and proteinuria. During the past several years controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that ACE inhibition reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and morbidity. This is especially important in patients in the United States, where 80% of excess mortality for diabetes mellitus is attributed to CVD. This article reviews the clinical trials in high-risk patients, especially those with diabetes, that shown beneficial CVD risk reduction with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "417": "The diabetic patient is at increased risk for cardiac events. Lowering hemoglobin A1c levels even within the normal range is associated with less cardiac risk. Oral agents for diabetes that reduce insulin resistance and its associated cardiac risk factors in addition to lowering glucose should be used. Energetic reduction of blood pressure with an emphasis on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers will further reduce cardiac risk. Reduction of low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels and elevation of high-density lipoprotein levels through judicious use of statins and other anti-lipid agents is essential and will lower the rate of cardiac events in the diabetic patients even more than in the nondiabetic patients. In addition, aspirin and folic acid supplementation should be utilized. Use of a multiple risk factor management strategy with these drugs will lower morbidity and mortality, improve quality of life, and save cost for the diabetic patient.", 
    "418": "The aim of this work was to ascertain, in nonmodulating essential hypertension, whether the abnormality in the renal blood supply is extended to the extremities and showed a similar response to ACE inhibition and whether these abnormalities could be identified in normotensive offspring of hypertensives, as non-modulation is a familial process with genetic underpinnings. We measured forearm vascular blood flow (FBF) and forearm vascular resistance (FVR) by plethysmography and urinary albumin excretion in 20 normotensive without family story of hypertension (NT: 25+/-9 years), 10 modulating offspring of hypertensive parents (MHO: 25+/-6 years), 10 nonmodulating offspring of hypertensive parents (NMHO: 26+/-5 years), 12 modulating essential hypertensives (MHT: 34+/-5 years), and 11 nonmodulating essential hypertensives (NMHT: 32+/-4 years). Measurements were repeated in hypertensives after 3-month treatment with ramipril (5 mg daily). Nonmodulating individuals showed lower maximum FBF (NMHT: 41.96+/-3.3 mL/100 g per minute and NMHO: 35.6+/-9.0 mL/100 g per minute) than modulating subjects (MHT: 57.5+/-10.0 mL/100 g per minute and MHO: 51.8+/-7.0 mL/100 g per minute; P<0.003). Likewise, all nonmodulating subjects showed higher minimum FVR (NMHT: 2.5+/-0.2 AU; NMO: 2.8+/-0.5 AU) than modulating individuals (MHT: 1.9+/-0.5 AU; MHO, 1.8+/-0.3AU; P<0.025). Urinary albumin excretion was higher in NMHT and NMHO than MHT, MHO, and NT (P<0.05). Ramipril increased maximum FBF to 53.8+/-8.0 mL/100 g per minute and reduced minimum FVR to 1.9+/-0.5 AU in NMHT (P<0.01). Likewise, ramipril increased effective renal plasma flow and reduced renal vascular resistance and urinary albumin excretion only in NMHT (P<0.05). These results have shown an early involvement of the peripheral circulation in association with increased urinary albumin excretion not only in essential hypertensives but also in NMHO. The effectiveness of ramipril in reducing minimum FVR and urinary albumin excretion in NMHT also suggests a common mechanism.", 
    "419": "(1) On rat isolated pulmonary arteries, vasorelaxation by S-nitrosocaptopril (SNOcap) was compared with S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and nitroprusside, and inhibition by SNOcap of contractions to angiotensin I was compared with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. (2) SNOcap was equipotent as a vasorelaxant on main (i.d. 2-3 mm) and intralobar (i.d. 600 micro m) pulmonary arteries (pIC(50) values: 5.00 and 4.85, respectively). Vasorelaxant responses reached equilibrium rapidly (2-3 min). (3) Pulmonary vasorelaxant responses to SNOcap, like GSNO, were (i) partially inhibited by the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo(4,3-a)-quinoxalin-1-one; 3 micro M) whereas responses to nitroprusside were abolished and (ii) potentiated by hydroxocobalamin (HCOB; NO. free radical scavenger; 100 micro M) whereas responses to nitroprusside were inhibited. (4) The relative potencies for pulmonary vasorelaxation compared with inhibition of platelet aggregation were: SNOcap 7 : 1; GSNO 25 : 1; nitroprusside >2000 : 1. (5) SNOcap, like captopril, concentration-dependently and time-dependently increased the EC(50) for angiotensin I but not angiotensin II. The dependence on incubation time was independent of the presence of tissue but differed for SNOcap and captopril. This difference reflected the slow dissociation of SNOcap and instability of captopril, and precluded a valid comparison of the potency of the two drugs. After prolonged incubation (>/=5.6 h) SNOcap was more effective than captopril. (6) Thus, in pulmonary arteries SNOcap (i) possesses NO donor properties characteristic of S-nitrosothiols but different from nitroprusside and (ii) inhibits ACE at least as effectively as captopril. These properties suggest that SNOcap could be valuable in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "420": "Recent preclinical and clinical studies indicate that aldosterone, independent of angiotensin II and elevated blood pressure, may play a role in health and disease. In addition to its role in fluid and electrolyte balance and circulatory homeostasis, more recent studies have identified aldosterone as a critical mediator of vascular damage. In animal studies, aldosterone is implicated in cardiac and vascular fibrosis, renal disease, and cerebrovascular damage. These lesions are prevented by specific aldosterone receptor blockade. In clinical studies, aldosterone receptor antagonism is associated with decreased hospitalization, symptomatology, and mortality, and improvement of endothelial dysfunction in patients with chronic heart failure. A better understanding of aldosterone's actions in nonepithelial tissues should pave the way to better protection of organs at risk such as the kidneys, heart, and brain.", 
    "421": "Left ventricular (LV) volume and pressure overload occur frequently in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anemia is a risk factor for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and dilatation, heart failure, and death. Normalization of hemoglobin with erythropoietin may prevent LVH and dilatation in CKD, but in patients in later phases of their cardiac disease, this intervention is not of benefit. Increased vascular volume causes hypertension, which in turn causes LVH, cardiac failure, and ischemic heart disease (IHD). Manifestations of arteriosclerosis are associated with adverse cardiac outcomes, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may improve LVH and markers of arteriosclerosis. Aortic stenosis in dialysis patients occurs infrequently, but may deteriorate rapidly. The hemodialysis milieu is the quintessential model of LV overload cardiomyopathy.", 
    "422": "Blood pressure levels are strongly predictive of the risks of first-ever and recurrent stroke. The benefits of blood pressure-lowering therapy for the prevention of fatal and non-fatal stroke in middle-aged individuals are well established. However, until recently, there has been uncertainty about the consistency of such benefits across different patient groups and in particular, for older people and in those with a history of stroke. This paper discusses the evidence surrounding the effectiveness of blood pressure-lowering therapy, specifically in older patients with a history of stroke, with particular attention paid to the results from the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS). PROGRESS was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 6105 individuals with a history of cerebrovascular disease recruited from 172 hospital outpatient clinics in ten countries. Participants (mean age 64 years; range 26-91 years) were randomly assigned to receive active treatment with an ACE inhibitor-based blood pressure-lowering regimen (perindopril) with or without addition of the diuretic indapamide, or matched placebo. At the end of follow up (mean of 4 years), active treatment reduced the incidence of total stroke by 28% (95% CI 17-38%) and the rate of major vascular events by 26% (95% CI 16-34%). Importantly, benefits of treatment were consistent across key patient subgroups, including those with and without hypertension, patients who were Asian and non-Asian, and for both ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes subtypes. Current evidence is now strong for clinicians to consider blood pressure-lowering therapy as pivotal in the prevention of stroke, especially in patients with a known history of cerebrovascular disease (and vascular disease, in general), irrespective of blood pressure levels, as soon as patients are clinically stable after an acute stroke or other vascular event. Additional age-specific analyses of the PROGRESS data, together with those from other completed trials, will provide more reliable information about the size of the benefits of blood pressure-lowering therapy, specifically for different age groups, and particularly in the oldest old (those aged >80 years). In the meantime though, an ACE inhibitor plus diuretic treatment regimen that maximises the degree of blood pressure reduction has a good safety profile and is an effective treatment that should be considered in all patients with stroke, including the elderly.",

    "436": "Estrogen inhibits adrenal angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) binding sites and attenuates the adrenal responsivity to angiotensin II (Ang II). Ang II modulates AT(1)R expression. Here, we determined if estrogen-induced down-regulation of adrenal AT(1)Rs involves modulation of adrenal Ang II. Female rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and injected with 17beta-estradiol benzoate (E(2); 40 micro g/kg) or vehicle for 7 d. Adrenal Ang II was separated from other angiotensin peptides by HPLC and measured by RIA. Scatchard analysis of radioligand binding curves showed that E(2) or captopril (Cap; 0.5 g/liter water) significantly reduced adrenal AT(1)R binding (maximum binding capacity) by 22% and 19%, respectively, compared with OVX (276 +/- 2.09 fmol/mg protein). E(2) and Cap lowered adrenal Ang II levels by 39% and 21%, respectively, compared with OVX (4.10 +/- 0.44 pmol/g). E(2) caused no further reductions in adrenal AT(1)R binding or in Ang II levels in Cap-treated OVX rats. High-dose Ang II infusion (1000 ng/kg.min) increased adrenal Ang II levels by 71% and lowered AT(1)R binding by 18%. Under these infusion conditions, E(2) did not reduce adrenal Ang II or AT(1)R binding. No differences in AT(1)R affinity (dissociation constant) were observed among groups. These data suggest that E(2) regulates the number of adrenal AT(1)R binding sites indirectly by modulating adrenal Ang II.", 
    "437": "The present study examined non-insulin-treated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats to determine the role of kinins in diabetic nephropathy. Their involvement in the renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) ramipril was investigated using the bradykinin (BK) B(2)-receptor antagonist, icatibant (HOE 140), or a combination of the two drugs.Although, none of the treatments prevented the decline of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in diabetic rats, ramipril (3 mg/kg/day), but not icatibant (HOE 140; 500 microg/kg/day), prevented proteinuria in these animals. However, the antiproteinuric effect of ramipril was reduced by 45% when combined with icatibant. To explore whether the renal kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) belongs to the underlying mechanisms of these findings, we also determined urinary BK levels, renal kallikrein (KLK) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity as well as renal cortical mRNA levels of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) and low-molecular weight (LMW) kininogen. STZ led to a reduction of renal KLK and ACE activity and NEP expression and to a three-fold increase of urinary BK excretion and renal kininogen expression. Icatibant given alone had no effect on these parameters. In contrast, ramipril treatment normalized urinary protein and BK excretion as well as kininogen mRNA expression without affecting NEP mRNA expression or KLK and ACE activity. Our data demonstrate that renal BK is increased in severe STZ-induced diabetes mellitus, but may affect glomerular regulation only to a minor degree under this condition. However, kinins are partly involved in the antiproteinuric action of ACEI at this stage of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "438": "Angioedema has different causes and different clinical presentations. Some types of angioedema may be mediated by bradykinin. We measured plasma levels of bradykinin-(1-9)nonapeptide by radioimmunoassay after high-performance liquid chromatography in patients with different types of angioedema during acute attacks and/or in remission, i.e. hereditary C1-inhibitor deficiency, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment, idiopathic non histaminergic and responders to antihistamines. Eleven patients with the deficiency of C1-inhibitor had very high levels of bradykinin during acute attacks of angioedema (18.0-90.0 pM) (normal range 0.2-7.1 pM). In three patients with history of ACE inhibitor-related angioedema, plasma bradykinin was high during ACE inhibitor treatment (62.0, 8.9 and 27.0 pM) and in a fourth patient was 47.0 pM during an acute attack and decreased by 93% to 3.2 pM after withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor. The patient with idiopathic angioedema, during an acute attack involving the right arm, had high levels of bradykinin in the venous blood refluent from the angioedematous arm (20.0 pM) while in the contralateral arm bradykinin levels were normal (6.6 pM), similarly to what we previously observed in cases of brachial angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency. The four patients with angioedema responsive to antihistamines had normal levels of bradykinin even during acute attacks (5.7, 3.4, 4.7 and 1.2 pM). In one of these patients who had a brachial angioedema, bradykinin levels were normal in the venous blood refluent from both arms. Bradykinin is involved in hereditary C1-inhibitor deficiency angioedema, in ACE inhibitor-related angioedema, and in idiopathic non-histaminergic angioedema, while bradykinin is not related to allergen-dependent or idiopathic angioedema that are responsive to antihistamines.",

Captopril 1 mg orally twice daily, intravenous furosemide 7 mg every 12 hours, and oral aldactone 7 mg twice daily were started. On day 5, the patient developed scaling erythematous skin lesions. On day 7, his temperature spiked to 37.8 degrees C, and pus discharge from the pacing wire site was noticed. Intravenous vancomycin 80 mg 3 times daily and intravenous ceftazidime 200 mg 3 times daily were initiated. On the same day, captopril was discontinued because we suspected that it had induced the skin reaction. On day 15, the infant's skin problem progressed. The dermatologist diagnosed partial TEN. On that day, theophylline and furosemide were also discontinued. On day 16, the patient still had some blisters, but the skin started to show signs of healing, until complete healing occurred on day 22.

However, long-term prognosis of patients in the community remains poor. It has been suggested that one of the reasons may be inadequate neuroendocrine suppression with current treatment strategies. To address this issue we measured plasma levels of angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone (Ald) in 41 patients (36 males, mean age 52 +/- 2 y) referred to our department for diagnostic evaluation, who were treated with clinically appropriate doses of ACEI. The mean angiographic left ventricular ejection fraction was 22 +/- 8%, left ventricular end diastolic diameter was 72 +/- 10 mm, and NYHA class was 2.6 +/- 0.7. Plasma levels of All and Ald were measured by radioimmunoassay. They did not differ significantly in comparison with the control group of 5 healthy individuals (4.8 +/- 8.2 pg/ml vs 4.1 +/- 3.2 pg/ml for angiotensin II and 129 +/- 93 pg/ml vs 78 +/- 29 pg/ml for aldosterone). A high variability of the results was seen between the individual patients. Full suppression of All (< 2.0 pg/ml) was achieved in 21 patients (58%), 10 pts (28%) showed intermediate levels (2.0-10.0 pg/ml), and 5 patients (14%) demonstrated markedly increased All levels (> 10 pg/ml). Full suppression of Ald (< 80 pg/ml) was seen in only 15 patients (37%), 14 patients (34%) had intermediate levels (80-140 pg/ml) and 12 patients (29%) showed high plasma levels of Ald (> 140 pg/ml). There was a weak, but significant, correlation between All and Ald levels in the study group (r = 0.49, p < 0.05). These preliminary results suggest inadequate neuroendocrine suppression in a substantial proportion of patients, despite using clinically relevant doses of ACE inhibitors. The determination of All and Ald levels may be a helpful tool in monitoring the efficacy of treatment in CHF and may help identify patients who would benefit from other treatment strategies.",

To address further the relation between RAS activation and the abnormalities in electrolyte and volume homeostasis, we studied the effect of the ANG II type I receptor antagonist losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on VDR-null mice. Treatment with losartan or captopril normalized the water intake and urine excretion of VDR-null mice. However, the increase in salt excretion in VDR-null mice was not affected by either drug, suggesting that this abnormality is independent of the RAS. Northern blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that both drugs caused a drastic stimulation of renin expression in wild-type and VDR-null mice, but renin expression remained much higher in the treated VDR-null mice than in the treated wild-type mice, suggesting that the ANG II feedback mechanism remains intact in the mutant mice. These data firmly established a causative relation between RAS overstimulation and the abnormal volume homeostasis in VDR-null mice and demonstrated that vitamin D repression of renin expression is independent of the ANG II feedback regulation in vivo.",

    "461": "A direct consequence of glomerular protein leakage is an increased exposure of proximal tubular cells to proteins. The aim of the present study was to examine whether chronic proteinuria affects the tubular handling of proteins and whether anti-proteinuric therapy by angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition restores this tubular function. Renal uptake and catabolic rate of the low-molecular-weight protein (LMWP) myoglobin was determined in anaesthetized control and adriamycin-induced nephrotic rats by external counting after radiolabelling. Proteinuria correlated with the uptake as well as the catabolism of myoglobin. The higher the proteinuria, the lower was the renal uptake of myoglobin (r =0.72, P =0.002). Also, the catabolic rate of myoglobin (r =0.80, P =0.0002) was lower with increasing severity of proteinuria. During treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, proteinuria was lowered by 79+/-9% (mean+/-S.E.M.). Renal uptake and catabolic rate of the LMWP were not restored by ACE inhibition. The catabolic rate of myoglobin was even decreased further with 48+/-5% compared with pretreatment levels. In summary, adriamycin-induced proteinuria is associated with a lower uptake and a lower catabolic rate of LMWP in the proximal tubule. ACE inhibition lowers proteinuria, but does not restore the affected LMWP uptake and rate of catabolism. The rate of LMWP catabolism is even decreased further. In contrast, the urinary excretion of N -acetyl glucosaminidase, the tubular marker of toxicity, was effectively returned to normal levels during ACE inhibition. Taken together, the data suggest that proteinuria is toxic for the proximal tubular cells and that ACE inhibition protects the remaining functional tubular cells directly against destruction through decreasing hypercatabolism.",

Even heart transplant candidates may respond better to intensified therapy if they have non-ischemic heart failure. The term 'non-ischemic heart failure' includes various subgroups such as hypertensive heart disease, myocarditis, alcoholic cardiomyopathy and cardiac dysfunction due to rapid atrial fibrillation. Some of these causes are reversible. The therapeutic effect of essential drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics does not, in general, significantly differ between ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure. However, in some trials, response to certain drugs (digoxin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inhibition with pentoxifylline, growth hormone and amiodarone) was found to be better in non-ischemic patients. Patients with ischemic heart failure and non-contracting ischemic viable myocardium may, on the other hand, considerably improve following revascularization. In view of prognostic and possible therapeutic differences, the etiology of heart failure should be determined routinely in all patients.", 
    "468": "Recent studies have identified the importance of biologically active molecules, such as neurohormones, as mediators of disease progression in heart failure. More recently, it has become apparent that, in addition to neurohormones, another portfolio of biologically active molecules, termed cytokines, are also expressed in the setting of heart failure. This article will review recent clinical material that suggests that tumor necrosis factor, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, may contribute to disease progression in heart failure by virtue of the direct toxic effects that this molecule exerts on the heart and circulation. In addition, this article reviews the existing clinical literature, which suggests that cytokine antagonism is safe and potentially effective in patients with heart failure.", 
    "469": "Current thinking views the progression of heart failure as the result of sustained activation of vasoconstrictor neurohormones. In this model, the sustained synthesis of vasoconstrictor neurohormones leads to disease progression through alterations in cardiomyocyte structure and function, which affects myocardial contractility, cardiac metabolism, and cellular growth. Ultimately, these events induce irreversible adverse ventricular remodeling through myocyte cell loss and progressive myocardial fibrosis. In the past decade, several landmark clinical trials tested the neurohormonal hypothesis, by targeting the activation of both the beta-adrenergic and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. Although the observed decrease in mortality using this strategy in heart failure populations was encouraging, morbidity and mortality levels remained elevated, and it has now been shown that several other humoral interactions are at play and potentially deserve antagonizing, or in the case of vasodilator neurohormones, deserve stimulation. It is known a family of vasodilator neurohormones - the natriuretic peptides - that have natriuretic, vasodilatory, and antiproliferative effects, endogenously inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. These peptides are degraded primarily by a neutral endopeptidase (NEP), an endothelial cell-surface zinc metallopeptidase, which shares a similar structure and catalytic site with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). NEPs have broad substrate specificity, encompassing atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and C-type natriuretic peptide, but also bradykinin and adrenomedullin. The recognition that ACE and NEP enzymes had related structures, led to the design and development of a class of molecules with a dual inhibitory effect on ACE and NEP, referred to as vasopeptidase inhibitors. Preliminary clinical trials in heart failure with vasopeptidase inhibitors have become available and show promising results. Thus, the combined inhibition of ACE and NEP, by attenuating excessive vasoconstriction and enhancing vasodilator substances, holds promise as a valuable option in heart failure treatment for the near future.",

Based on the available evidence, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors remain the cornerstone in the treatment of CHF. However, much more information should be available in the next few years, which will provide more evidence on how to use ARAs and in which patients.", 
    "471": "Heart failure is the term used for a cardiovascular syndrome whose definition lacks uniform criteria. It is associated with a very high mortality rate. Approximately 50% of deaths in patients with heart failure are sudden, mostly due to ventricular tachycardia (VT). In severe heart failure, death may also occur due to bradyarrhythmias. Other arrhythmias complicating heart failure include atrial and ventricular extrasystoles, atrial fibrillation, and sustained or non-sustained VT. Depending on the etiology of heart failure, different preconditions, including ischemia or structural alterations (such as fibrosis) may be prominent. Re-entrant mechanisms around scar tissue, afterdepolarizations, and triggered activity due to changes in calcium metabolism significantly contribute to arrhythmogenesis. The treatment of the underlying disease process and optimal management of heart failure is of major importance. Revascularization, beta-blocker therapy, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are all essential to appropriate therapy. Treatment of arrhythmias is performed either because patients are symptomatic or to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is the best available therapy to prevent sudden cardiac death from VT. Devices with back-up pacing also offer protection against bradyarrhythmias. There is evidence that patients with sustained VT or a history of resuscitation have the best outcome with ICD therapy regardless of the degree of heart failure. Many of these patients require additional antiarrhythmic therapy (e.g. amiodarone) because of atrial fibrillation or non-sustained VT that may activate the device.", 
    "472": "There is now conclusive evidence that most patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction should be treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers. They will also need diuretics for the control of fluid retention. There is also a powerful case for adding spironolactone to the treatment of patients with more severe symptoms. Many doctors would also use digoxin and, especially if coronary disease is present, aspirin or warfarin. Most patients also have other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, arthritis, depression and dyspepsia, and each of these may provoke the prescription of yet another agent. Many patients will receive prescriptions to treat the side-effects of their therapy. Finding a sure path through the morass of pharmacotherapy is a daunting task. Polypharmacy is having a negative impact on new drug research in an area where there are in fact remarkably few really effective treatments and the therapeutic problem is only partially solved. This paper discusses some of the issues surrounding polypharmacy in heart failure and how to resolve them, using an illustrative case history. It highlights the potential benefits of polypharmacy with effective drugs and the gross over-use of ineffective treatments in heart failure. The major problem with polypharmacy in heart failure is not the heart failure treatment itself, but the drugs for other concomitant conditions, the effectiveness of which is often not supported by an appropriate evidence base and for which alternative, less noxious management strategies often exist. Polypharmacy may be deleterious not only because of the increased potential for side-effects and drug interactions but also because taking unnecessary therapy reduces compliance with effective drugs.", 
    "473": "Heart failure is an important public health problem and one for which morbidity and mortality remain high despite treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. A large number of clinical trials examining the effects of beta-blockers in the treatment of heart failure have now been performed. Two large-scale clinical trials have recently confirmed significant survival benefits with these agents, with effects that are additive to those achieved with ACE inhibitor therapy. These trials have now established beta-blocker therapy as an important part of standard heart failure treatment. The clinical use of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure requires careful translation of the randomized controlled trials into everyday clinical practice. Patient selection is key to the safe use of beta-blockers. Patients who may be suitable for beta-blockade therapy include those with mild-moderate heart failure due to left ventricular systolic impairment, those who are receiving adequate dose of diuretics and ACE inhibitors and those whose clinical condition is stable at the time of initiation of the beta-blocker. Survival benefits have been demonstrated with bisoprolol, carvedilol and metoprolol. Whether different beta-blockers have important clinical differences with regard to clinical end-points is as yet uncertain. beta-Blockers should be initiated at low dose, with titration of dose over several weeks and careful clinical monitoring for potential adverse effects, such as hypotension or worsening congestion. This careful application of the clinical trials into clinical practice will allow the safe use of this effective treatment for patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "474": "In many forms of cardiomyopathic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, there is a rapid myocardial expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) which mediate, via specific receptors, various processes such as gene expression, cell growth or apoptosis. In the initial stages of myocarditis, the myocardial expression of proinflammatory cytokines appears to be part of an inflammatory process. In many other conditions such as ischaemic cardiomyopathy and chronic LV pressure or volume overload, myocardial expression of proinflammatory cytokines is triggered by an elevation of LV wall stress. Myocardial expression of cytokines contributes to depression of contractile performance and adverse LV remodelling. Cytokine-induced depression of contractile performance appears to result from sphingosine production, which interferes with myocardial calcium handling. In transgenic mice, the rate of progression of LV dilatation appears to correlate with the intensity of myocardial TNF-alpha overexpression. In heart failure patients, cytokine concentrations are elevated not only in the myocardium but also in plasma. Cytokines are, therefore, responsible not only for autocrine and paracrine signalling within the myocardium but also for endocrine signalling throughout the body, especially affecting striated muscle mass with induction of muscle wasting and cachexia. The source of cytokine production in heart failure remains uncertain and several mechanisms have been proposed including endotoxin-induced immune activation due to bowel oedema, myocardial production due to haemodynamic overload and peripheral extramyocardial production due to tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. The latter seems to be the most likely mechanism, possibly modulated by the presence of bacterial endotoxins released from the gut. Numerous drugs have meanwhile been shown to influence this cardioinflammatory response to heart failure either by reducing basal levels of cytokines (e.g. amlodipine, pentoxifylline, beta-blockers) or by reducing endotoxin-induced cytokine gene expression (e.g. ouabain, amiodarone, adenosine, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II-receptor blockers). Direct blockade of the deleterious actions of elevated plasma levels of cytokines recently became possible through intravenous infusion of a soluble TNF-alpha receptor fusion protein, which resulted in an increase in exercise tolerance and LV performance.", 
    "475": "Clinical suspicion of congestive heart failure (CHF) always requires a careful diagnostic workup. This comprises the verification of the presence of CHF (in contrast to other conditions that cause nonspecific phenomena such as shortness of breath and edema), evaluation of the underlying cause of heart failure, and assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function. In addition to clinical examination, echocardiography is warranted in most cases. On the basis of this information, patients can be selected for further studies, such as exercise testing, cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. In view of the serious prognosis of heart failure, especially systolic CHF, the threshold for specialist consultation should be low. Although the classification of CHF into systolic and diastolic forms is complex, clinically meaningful data can be derived simply by determining whether LV systolic function is impaired (predominantly systolic CHF) or not (probable diastolic CHF). In the latter case, treatment is mainly symptomatic in addition to the management of the underlying condition (e.g. hypertension). In systolic CHF, considerable therapeutic advances have recently been made and it is important that patients receive appropriate care to improve their prognosis. These measures include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone.",

We have determined the crystal structures of AnCE, a Drosophila homolog of ACE, with and without bound inhibitors to 2.4 A resolution. AnCE contains a large internal channel encompassing the entire protein molecule. This substrate-binding channel is composed of two chambers, reminiscent of a peanut shell. The inhibitor and zinc-binding sites are located in the narrow bottleneck connecting the two chambers. The substrate and inhibitor specificity of AnCE appears to be determined by extensive hydrogen-bonding networks and ionic interactions in the active site channel. The catalytically important zinc ion is coordinated by the conserved Glu395 and histidine residues from a HExxH motif.",

Active treatment comprised the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily), with the addition of the diuretic indapamide at the discretion of treating physicians. Over a mean of 3.9 years of follow-up, active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9/4 mm Hg compared with placebo and reduced the primary outcome, stroke, by 28%. Major coronary events occurred in 269 participants (active 3.8%, placebo 5.0%) and heart failure was diagnosed in 264 participants (active 3.7%, placebo 4.9%). Active treatment reduced the risk of major coronary events by 26% (95% CI: 6-42%; p=0.02) and the risk of congestive heart failure by 26% (5-42%; p=0.02). For each of these outcomes, there was no clear evidence of differences between the treatment effects in participants classified as hypertensive or non-hypertensive, and those with or without a history of coronary heart disease.",

Only 17.2% were under the combination of diuretic, ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. Important local variations were found in the rate of prescription of ACE inhibitors and particularly beta-blockers. Daily dosage of ACE inhibitors and particularly of beta-blockers was on average below the recommended target dose. Modelling-analysis of the prescription of treatments indicated that the aetiology of heart failure, age, co-morbid factors and type of hospital ward influenced the rate of prescription. Age <70 years, male gender and ischaemic aetiology were associated with an increased odds ratio for receiving an ACE inhibitor. Prescription of ACE inhibitors was also greater in diabetic patients and in patients with low ejection fraction (<40%) and lower in patients with renal dysfunction. The odds ratio for receiving a beta-blocker was reduced in patients >70 years, in patients with respiratory disease and increased in cardiology wards, in ischaemic heart failure and in male subjects. Prescription of cardiac glycosides was significantly increased in patients with supraventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation. Finally, the rate of prescription of antithrombotic agents was increased in the presence of supraventricular arrhythmia, ischaemic heart disease, male subjects but was decreased in patients over 70.",

In the placebo group, renal function (GFR(c)) declined by 5.5 min(-1)within 1 year, vs only 0.5 ml min(-1)in the ACE inhibitor group (P<0.05). This beneficial effect of captopril was most pronounced in patients with the most compromised renal function at baseline. The incidence of chronic heart failure (CHF) within 1 year increased significantly with decreasing GFR(c)(divided into tertiles: 24.0, 28.9, and 41.2%; P<0.01).

After one year of ACE inhibitors treatment, we noted the following circadian changes: Significant increase of RMSSD, pNN50 (p < 0.05), TP, VLF, LF and HF (p < 0.05) parameters with non-significant increases in LF/HF ratio during night recording. A comparison between daily HRV parameters, before and after 1 year of ACEI treatment, presented significant increases in pNN50 and RMSSD mean values (p = 0.01) and decreases in LF/HF ratio, with simultaneous withdrawal of spectral parameters.

It occurs in 10% to 15% of graft recipients and usually develops 8 to 24 months after engraftment. Spontaneous remission of established PTE is observed in one fourth of the patients within 2 years from onset, whereas in the remaining three fourths it persists for several years, only to remit after loss of renal function from rejection. Predisposing factors include male gender, retention of native kidneys, smoking, transplant renal artery stenosis, adequate erythropoiesis prior to transplantation, and rejection-free course with well-functioning renal graft. Just as in other forms of erythrocytosis, a substantial number (approximately 60%) of patients with PTE experience malaise, headache, plethora, lethargy, and dizziness. Thromboembolic events occur in 10% to 30% of the cases; 1% to 2% eventually die of associated complications. Posttransplant erythrocytosis results from the combined trophic effect of multiple and interrelated erythropoietic factors. Among them, endogenous erythropoietin appears to play the central role. Persistent erythropoietin secretion from the diseased and chronically ischemic native kidneys does not conform to the normal feedback regulation, thereby establishing a form of \"tertiary hypererythropoietinemia.\" However, erythropoietin levels in most PTE patients still remain within the \"normal range,\" indicating that erythrocytosis finally ensues by the contributory action of additional growth factors on erythroid progenitors, such as angiotensin II, androgens, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).

Blocking angiotensin II with ramipril significantly improved all of these parameters (all P < 0.01). At the molecular level, expressions of OPN and TGF-beta1 were up-regulated in the OLETF rats, and were markedly suppressed following ramipril treatment. The sites of strong OPN mRNA and protein expressions were localized to areas of renal injury. Of note, the expression of OPN mRNA was strongly correlated with the number of ED-1-positive cells (r = 0.560, P = 0.01) and the tubulointerstitial fibrosis score (r = 0.500, P < 0.05).",

In parallel, decreased deposition of extracellular matrix and lessened interstitial fibrosis as well as reduced amounts of renal transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) could be demonstrated. Late therapy starting at seven weeks decreased proteinuria, however, lifespan did not increase significantly.", 
    "504": "The results indicate an antiproteinuric and antifibrotic nephroprotective effect of ramipril in COL4A3 -/- mice is mediated by down-regulation of TGF-beta1. This effect in mice is enhanced by initiation of therapy during pre-symptomatic disease.

However, inhibition of angiotensin is not achieved completely through the blocking effects of ACE inhibitors, and the possibility of a non-ACE pathway for generation of angiotensin II has important implications for treating cardiovascular disease. The selective quality of ARBs for the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor may confer an advantage. In a recently reported trial, the ARB valsartan substantially improved patients' New York Heart Association class, clinical signs and symptoms, and quality of life and provided morbidity and mortality benefits in selected patients. Valsartan was recently approved to treat heart failure in patients who cannot be maintained on an ACE inhibitor. As a class, ARBs are well tolerated and have a good safety profile.",

Dogs were hemorrhaged (mean arterial pressure [MAP] 40-45 mmHg for 30 min, then 30-35 mmHg for 30 min) and were then resuscitated with intermittent lactated Ringer's solution (200 mL/kg/h during first 40 min, and 60 mL/kg/h during the following 130 min, MAP 75-80 mmHg). A constant-rate infusion of saline with or without enalaprilat (0.02 mg/kg/h) was initiated after 40 min of resuscitation. Blood flows declined with hemorrhage, increased with resuscitation, and then declined during the initial 40 min of resuscitation. Enalaprilat administration resulted in blood flow increases not seen in the controls (ending values for cardiac index: 2.8 +/- 0.4 L/min/m2 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3 L/min/m2; celiac arterial flow 314 +/- 66 L/min/m2 vs. 139 +/- 13 mL/min/m2; and portal venous flow 596 +/- 172 L/min/m2 vs. 414 +/- 81 mL/min/m2 for enalaprilat versus controls, respectively). The greater flows with enalaprilat appeared to be due to prevention of the increases in afterload noted in the controls (ending arterial elastance values 3.73 +/- 0.97 mmHg/m2/mL vs. 7.74 +/- 1.80 mmHg/m2/mL for enalaprilat versus controls, respectively). We conclude that administration of a constant-rate infusion of enalaprilat during resuscitation can be used to improve systemic and mesenteric blood flow.",

His left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 29%. Therefore we had to postpone the operation and tried to improve his cardiac function. We controlled his dry weight more strictly with hemodialysis and limited in take of salt and water to reduce preload of his heart and administered erythropoietin to improve his anemic condition. We administered angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) to control his blood pressure and reduce afterload of his heart. Two months later, his cardiac function was marked improved (LVEF, 29% to 47%), and he underwent renal transplantation. Five months after the operation, improvement of his cardiac function kept on being observed in spite of the cessation of treatment for his heart (LVEF, 47% to 68%). Successful renal transplantation can significantly improve the cardiac function of patients on maintenance dialysis.", 
    "516": "To evaluate the effect of peptidases on mu-opioid receptor (MOR) activation by endogenous opioids, we measured MOR-1 internalization in rat spinal cord slices. A mixture of inhibitors of aminopeptidases (amastatin), dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (captopril), and neutral endopeptidase (phosphoramidon) dramatically increased the potencies of Leu-enkephalin and dynorphin A to produce MOR-1 internalization, and also enhanced the effects of Met-enkephalin and alpha-neoendorphin, but not endomorphins or beta-endorphin. The omission of any one inhibitor abolished Leu-enkephalin-induced internalization, indicating that all three peptidases degraded enkephalins. Amastatin preserved dynorphin A-induced internalization, and phosphoramidon, but not captopril, increased this effect, indicating that the effect of dynorphin A was prevented by aminopeptidases and neutral endopeptidase. Veratridine (30 microm) or 50 mm KCl produced MOR-1 internalization in the presence of peptidase inhibitors, but little or no internalization in their absence. These effects were attributed to opioid release, because they were abolished by the selective MOR antagonist CTAP (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH(2)) and were Ca(2+) dependent. The effect of veratridine was protected by phosphoramidon plus amastatin or captopril, but not by amastatin plus captopril or by phosphoramidon alone, indicating that released opioids are primarily cleaved by neutral endopeptidase, with a lesser involvement of aminopeptidases and dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. Therefore, because the potencies of endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2 to elicit internalization were unaffected by peptidase inhibitors, the opioids released by veratridine were not endomorphins. Confocal microscopy revealed that MOR-1-expressing neurons were in close proximity to terminals containing opioids with enkephalin-like sequences. These findings indicate that peptidases prevent the activation of extrasynaptic MOR-1 in dorsal horn neurons.",

Compared with men, women also demonstrate differences in remodeling and the response to injury, such as volume or pressure overload and myocardial infarction. We are only beginning to understand the clinical implications of these gender differences and their impact on pharmacologic treatments.

To test this possibility, in this study we examined the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an antagonist of the type-1 ANG II receptor (AT(1) receptor) on the LPS-induced production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 in dehydrated rats. A single intravenous injection of LPS induced a marked increase in the expression of IL-1beta mRNA in the liver, an effect that was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the ACE inhibitor. Furthermore, the ACE inhibitor reduced the LPS-induced increase in the hepatic concentration of IL-1beta protein. When the AT(1)-receptor antagonist was given intravenously before the LPS, the increase in the hepatic concentration of IL-1beta was significantly reduced. Finally, the ACE inhibitor reduced the LPS-induced increase in the plasma concentration of IL-6. These results represent the first in vivo evidence that ANG II and its AT(1) receptor play important roles in the production of proinflammatory cytokines that is induced by LPS under dehydrated conditions.",

Western blots indicated a parallel increase in Kv4.2 and Kv1.2, channel proteins that underlie the transient and (part of the) sustained currents. Under diabetic and hypothyroid conditions, both currents were also augmented by an endothelin receptor blocker (PD142893) or by an endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Kv4.2 density was also enhanced by PD142893. Incubation (>5 h) with the PKC inhibitor bis-indolylmaleimide augmented both currents, whereas the PKC activator dioctanoyl-rac-glycerol (DiC8) prevented the augmentation of currents by quinapril. DiC8 also prevented the augmentation of Kv4.2 density by quinapril. Specific peptides that activate PKC translocation indicated that PKC-epsilon and not PKC-delta is involved in ANG II action on these currents. In control myocytes, quinapril and PD142893 augmented the sustained late current but had no effect on peak current. It is concluded that an autocrine release of angiotensin and endothelin in diabetic and hypothyroid conditions attenuates K(+) currents by suppressing the synthesis of some K(+) channel proteins, with the effects mediated at least partially by PKC-epsilon.",

Cilazapril, an ACE inhibitor with high affinity, has been shown to be highly effective against a variety of vascular disorders. The effectiveness of isometric handgrip exercise on changes of cardiovascular hemodynamic parameters before and after cilazapril treatment in patients with congestive heart failure is unknown.", 
    "527": "The study population included 30 patients (16 male, 14 female) with mean age of 65+/-18 years. The effects of handgrip maneuver on hemodynamic parameters were studied by right heart catheterization and Doppler echocardiography.", 
    "528": "Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressures (MAP) increased significantly after handgrip maneuver (from 95+/-6 beats/min to 101+/-12 beats/min; from 109+/-15 mm Hg to 118+/-19 mm Hg, p<0.05 respectively). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary artery systolic (s) and diastolic (d) pressures (PAP), cardiac index (CI), right ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures (RVPs and RVPd), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) did not change after handgrip maneuvers (p>0.05). On the other hand, PAPs and PAPd, RVPs and RVPd, MAP and HR (p<0.05) decreased significantly during handgrip maneuvers after cilazapril treatment. However PCWP and CI, LVEF, RVEF did not change after treatment (p>0.05).", 
    "529": "Cardiovascular response to handgrip maneuver may be a marker of failure to respond to compensatory mechanisms. Cilazapril treatment was associated with significant improvement in hemodynamic parameters during handgrip stress test, the mechanisms of which are increased sympathetic and renin-angiotensin system activation, and altered vascular tonus.", 
    "530": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of benazepril addition to amlodipine antihypertensive treatment on ankle-foot volume (AFV) and pretibial subcutaneous tissue pressure (PSTP), two objective measures of ankle oedema. A total of 32 mild to moderate essential hypertensives (DBP>90 and <110 mmHg), aged 30-70 years were studied. After a 4-week placebo period, they were randomized to amlodipine 5 mg o.d. or benazepril 10 mg o.d. or amlodipine 5 mg plus benazepril 10 mg o.d. for 4 weeks, according to a crossover design. At the end of the placebo period and of each active treatment period, blood pressure,AFV and PSTP were evaluated. AFV was measured using the principle of water displacement. PSTP was assessed using a system, the subcutaneous pretibial interstitial environment with a water manometer. Both amlodipine and benazepril monotherapy significantly reduced SBP (-18.2+/-4 and -17.8+/-4 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01 vs baseline) and DBP (-12.1+/-3 and -11.7+/-3 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01); the reduction was increased by the combination (-24.2+/-5 mmHg for SBP, P<0.001 and -16.8+/-4 mmHg for DBP, P<0.001). Amlodipine monotherapy significantly increased both AFV (+17.1%, P<0.001 vs baseline) and PSTP (+56.6%, P<0.001 vs baseline). As compared to amlodipine alone, the combination produced a less pronounced increase in AFV (+5.5%, P<0.05 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs amlodipine) and PSTP (+20.5%, P<0.05 vs baseline and P<0.01 vs amlodipine). Ankle oedema was clinically evident in 11 patients with amlodipine monotherapy and in three patients with the combination. These results suggest that ACE-inhibitors partially counteract the microcirculatory changes responsible for Ca-antagonists-induced oedema formation.", 
    "531": "This study was undertaken to determine whether enhanced external counterpulsation is a safe and effective treatment for angina in octogenarians. In this prospective observational study, demographic and clinical outcome data on patients consecutively enrolled in the International EECP Patient Registry was examined. Of the 3037 patients analyzed, 249 (8%) were >/=80 years old. Octogenarians were more likely to be female and have a history of congestive heart failure (41% vs. 29%; p<0.001). They were less likely to have had previous revascularization. Fewer patients in the octogenarian group (76% vs. 84%; p<0.01) completed a course of treatment. Of those octogenarian patients who completed treatment, 76% reported a reduction in angina and quality of life improved significantly. Adverse events related to treatment were low. At 6-month follow-up, 81% reported maintenance of angina improvement. Thus, enhanced external counterpulsation is a low-risk intervention that offers octogenarians the ability to return to more normal activity and a better quality of life.", 
    "532": "Despite the development of hypertension treatment guidelines, blood pressure control in the general population remains inadequate, indicating the need for ongoing re-evaluation of treatment strategies to further improve blood pressure control. Hypertension results from alterations in cardiac output and/or peripheral resistance. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may be responsible, at least in part, for these alterations. Despite pharmacologic intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin type-1 receptor antagonists, aldosterone continues to be produced. Therapeutic modalities for treating hypertension directed toward antagonizing aldosterone might more effectively control blood pressure. Eplerenone, a new selective aldosterone receptor antagonist, recently received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hypertension, either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. The objective of this review is to summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, emphasizing the role for aldosterone antagonism in the management of hypertension, with a focus on eplerenone.", 
    "533": "Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] has biological actions that can often be distinguished from those of angiotensin II (Ang II). Recent studies indicate that the effects of Ang-(1-7) are mediated by specific receptor(s). We now report the partial characterization of a new antagonist selective for Ang-(1-7), D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7). D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) (50 pmol) inhibited the hypertensive effect induced by microinjection of Ang-(1-7) [4+/-1 vs 21+/-2 mm Hg, 25 pmol Ang-(1-7) alone] into the rostral ventrolateral medulla without changing the effect of Ang II (16+/-2.5 vs 19+/-2.5 mm Hg after 25 pmol Ang II alone). At 10(-7) mol/L concentration, it completely blocked the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation produced by Ang-(1-7) (10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L) in the mouse aorta. The antidiuresis produced by Ang-(1-7) (40 pmol/100 g body weight) in water-loaded rats was also blocked by its analog [1 microg/100 g body weight; 3.08+/-0.8 vs 1.27+/-0.33 mL in Ang-(1-7)-treated rats]. D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) at a molar ratio of 40:1 did not change the hypotensive effect of bradykinin. Moreover, D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) did not affect the dipsogenic effect produced by intracerebroventricular administration of Ang II (11.4+/-1.15 vs 8.8+/-1.2 mL/h after Ang II) and did not show any demonstrable angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity in assays with the synthetic substrate Hip-His-Leu and rat plasma as a source of enzyme. Autoradiography studies with 125I-Ang-(1-7) in mouse kidney slices showed that D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) competed for the binding of Ang-(1-7) to the cortical supramedullary region. In Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the AT1 receptor subtype, D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) did not compete for the specific binding of 125I-Ang-II in concentrations up to 10(-6) mol/L. There was also no significant displacement of Ang II binding to angiotensin type 2 receptors in membrane preparations of adrenal medulla. These data indicate that D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) is a selective antagonist for Ang-(1-7), which can be useful to clarify the functional role of this heptapeptide.", 
    "534": "The aim of the present study was to distinguish between the direct effects of the renal nerves on renal function and indirect effects via neurally mediated increased systemic angiotensin II. We applied low-level electrical stimulation (1 Hz) to the left renal nerves in pentobarbitone-anesthetized rabbits for 180 minutes and measured renal blood flow, sodium excretion, and urine flow rate from both the stimulated and the nonstimulated contralateral kidney in the presence and the absence of ACE inhibition (enalaprilat). Stimulation resulted in an angiotensin II-mediated rise in arterial pressure and decreases in renal blood flow, urine flow rate, and sodium excretion on the stimulated side. On the nonstimulated denervated side, we found no change in renal blood flow, but found a decrease in urine flow rate. With ACE inhibition, renal stimulation no longer caused an increase in arterial pressure, the antidiuretic responses of the stimulated kidney were attenuated, and, importantly, the decrease in urine flow rate on the nonstimulated kidney was completely abolished. We therefore propose that although a direct effect of the renal nerves on sodium excretion is clearly present, the antidiuresis and antinatriuresis observed during renal activation is further supported by a neurally mediated increase in systemic angiotensin II.", 
    "535": "We demonstrated recently that a significant reduction in both the molecular synthesis and functional expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the medullary origin of sympathetic vasomotor outflow, underlies the augmented sympathetic vasomotor tone during hypertension. This study further evaluated the hypothesis that this downregulation of basal iNOS at the RVLM during hypertension is innate. In adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated for 4 weeks with the antihypertensive captopril to normalize elevated blood pressure or in young prehypertensive SHR, the significantly lower iNOS mRNA and protein levels at the ventrolateral medulla under basal conditions or on activation by microinjection bilaterally into the RVLM of lipopolysaccharide (10 ng) remained unaltered. The retarded efficacy of lipopolysaccharide (10 ng) to elicit cardiovascular depression (hypotension, bradycardia, and reduction in sympathetic vasomotor tone) also persevered in captopril-treated adult or young normotensive SHR. On the other hand, compared with Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats, the magnitude of cardiovascular depression induced in adult SHR by local administration into the RVLM of the NO precursor l-arginine (40 nmol) was significantly smaller. In addition, microinjection bilaterally into the RVLM of a selective iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine (125 or 250 pmol), was discernibly less efficacious in unmasking hypertension, tachycardia, and the increase in sympathetic vasomotor tone in adult SHR. We conclude that a predisposed reduction in molecular synthesis and functional expression of basal iNOS in the RVLM is associated with the sympathetic vasomotor overactivity during hypertension.", 
    "536": "There is little information on the processes affecting selective tissue ACE inhibition and the implications in human subjects. We compared intravenously administered ACE inhibitors, perindoprilat and enalaprilat, for myocardial drug uptake and effects on angiotensin and bradykinin peptides versus hemodynamic effects in 25 patients with stable angina and well-preserved left ventricular systolic function. Myocardial uptake was rapid and more efficient for perindoprilat than for enalaprilat (peak content at 26+/-3 and 30+/-4 seconds, 0.58+/-0.12% and 0.27+/-0.07% of the administered dose for perindoprilat and enalaprilat, respectively, P=0.04 for difference). Both drugs caused a decrease in angiotensin (Ang) II level, an increase in Ang I level, and reduction in Ang II/Ang I ratio in arterial and coronary sinus blood. Bradykinin (BK)-(1-9) and BK-(1-8) levels increased in arterial blood and BK-(1-8) levels increased in coronary sinus blood after drug administration. Perindoprilat and enalaprilat caused a small decrease in mean arterial pressure (-3+/-1%, P<0.05; and -4+/-1%, P<0.01, respectively) and LV+dP/dt (-5.8+/-1.7%, P<0.01 and -4.2+/-2.8%, P<0.05, respectively), whereas systemic vascular resistance index was unchanged. Despite relatively cardioselective uptake of perindoprilat, both drugs had similar effects on the cardiac metabolism of angiotensin and bradykinin and on cardiac function. Under resting conditions, both drugs exerted small negative inotropic effects.", 
    "537": "ACE2, initially cloned from a human heart, is a recently described homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) but contains only a single enzymatic site that catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9 [Ang(1-9)] and is not inhibited by classic ACE inhibitors. It also converts angiotensin II to Ang(1-7). Although the role of ACE2 in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system is not known, the renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications and in particular in diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the possible involvement of this new enzyme in the kidney from diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats to compare and contrast it to ACE. ACE2 and ACE gene and protein expression were measured in the kidney after 24 weeks of streptozocin diabetes. ACE2 and ACE mRNA levels were decreased in diabetic renal tubules by approximately 50% and were not influenced by ACE inhibitor treatment with ramipril. By immunostaining, both ACE2 and ACE protein were localized predominantly to renal tubules. In the diabetic kidney, there was reduced ACE2 protein expression that was prevented by ACE inhibitor therapy. The identification of ACE2 in the kidney, its modulation in diabetes, and the recent description that this enzyme plays a biological role in the generation and degradation of various angiotensin peptides provides a rationale to further explore the role of this enzyme in various pathophysiological states including diabetic complications.", 
    "538": "The enormous benefits of inhibition of ACE demonstrate that manipulation of the metabolism of peptide hormones is a valuable therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular disease. Recent attempts to expand these benefits have combined ACE inhibition with inhibition of other peptidases such as neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in a single molecule, a strategy known as vasopeptidase inhibition. NEP metabolizes natriuretic peptides, and NEP inhibition offers the prospect of combining the benefits of increased natriuretic peptide levels with those of ACE inhibition. However, peptidases such as ACE and NEP have many different substrates, and there are complex interactions between ACE inhibition and NEP inhibition. Both ACE and NEP metabolize the kinin peptides bradykinin and kallidin, and NEP also converts angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang-(1-7) and metabolizes Ang II and endothelin. Addition of NEP inhibition to ACE inhibition potentiates the ACE inhibitor-induced increase in kinin levels, increases Ang II levels, reduces Ang-(1-7) levels, and may increase endothelin levels. These additional consequences of combined ACE/NEP inhibition increase the risk of angioedema and may counteract any benefit of ACE inhibition that depends on reduced Ang II levels and increased Ang-(1-7) levels. Further considerations are that the ratio of ACE and NEP inhibition is fixed for vasopeptidase inhibitors, and there is uncertainty how these drugs should be compared with ACE inhibitors. Vasopeptidase inhibitors will therefore require careful evaluation before they are introduced to patient care.", 
    "539": "Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) may play a central signaling role in vascular remodeling. We investigated a possible combined role for the renin-angiotensin system and platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor (PDGF-beta-R) in pressure-induced ERK1/2 activation in intact rat mesenteric small arteries. In an organ culture model, vessels were pressurized (70 mm Hg) for 1 hour plus a 5-minute intervention period. The intervention was either a rise in intraluminal pressure (up to 140 mm Hg) or challenge with angiotensin II (Ang II, 0.1 micromol/L) or PDGF-BB (30 microg/L). ERK1/2 activation was determined by Western blotting as formation of phosphorylated ERK1/2. All interventions caused ERK1/2 activation that was inhibited by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. The response to pressure was inhibited by an ACE inhibitor (perindoprilat), an Ang II receptor type 1 (R-AT1) antagonist (candesartan), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein, herbimycin A). An R-AT2 antagonist (PD123319) had no significant effect. Both a PDGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RPR101511A) and a neutralizing PDGF-beta-R antibody (AF385) inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 caused by PDGF-BB, Ang II, and pressure. That the latter interventions could indeed inhibit the PDGF-beta-R was supported by experiments with unmounted vessels in which PDGF-beta-R activation was measured by Western blot; both PDGF-BB and Ang II-mediated PDGF-beta-R activation were inhibited by RPR101511A and AF385. Immunohistochemistry showed that ERK1/2 and PDGF-beta-R was located in the adventitia, tunica media, and intima. The results suggest that pressure in rat mesenteric small arteries causes acute activation of ERK1/2 through pathways involving Ang II and PDGF-beta-R.", 
    "540": "Increased dietary salt intake was used as a nonpharmacological tool to blunt hypotension-induced increases in plasma renin activity (PRA) in order to evaluate the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to hypotension-induced thirst. Rats were maintained on 8% NaCl (high) or 1% NaCl (standard) diet for at least 2 wk, and then arterial hypotension was produced by administration of the arteriolar vasodilator diazoxide. Despite marked reductions in PRA, rats maintained on the high-salt diet drank similar amounts of water, displayed similar latencies to drink, and had similar degrees of hypotension compared with rats maintained on the standard diet. Furthermore, blockade of ANG II production by an intravenous infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril attenuated the hypotension-induced water intake similarly in rats fed standard and high-salt diet. Additional experiments showed that increases in dietary salt did not alter thirst stimulated by the acetylcholine agonist carbachol administered into the lateral ventricle; however, increases in dietary salt did enhance thirst evoked by central ANG II. Collectively, the present findings suggest that hypotension-evoked thirst in rats fed a high-salt diet is dependent on the peripheral RAS despite marked reductions in PRA.", 
    "541": "Increased physical activity is followed by a stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and this effect is probably more pronounced in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension than in healthy controls. The role of sustained exercise in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure, with and without antihypertensive therapy, is unclear, as is hormonal regulation of the renal hemodynamics. We hypothesized that prolonged low-intensity bicycle exercise would have a greater effect in patients with chronic renal failure than in controls, and that antihypertensive treatment would ameliorate these effects.", 
    "542": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), norepinephrine (NE) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured in the upright position before and during low-intensity exercise for 2 h in healthy controls (n = 8) and in hypertensive patients with moderately reduced renal function who were not taking antihypertensives (n = 7) or who were receiving treatment with captopril (n = 10), enalapril (n = 6) or verapamil (n = 9).", 
    "543": "GFR tended to decrease and ERPF decreased significantly in healthy individuals when exercise duration was prolonged from 1 to 2 h. An earlier decline in GFR and ERPF was seen in the renal failure patients compared with the controls. Filtration fraction (FF) increased during exercise in all groups except the group taking enalapril. MAP increased in the captopril group during exercise but was unchanged in the other groups. Treatment with captopril produced a more pronounced and earlier fall in exercise-induced GFR than in untreated controls, while verapamil treatment completely blunted the decline in GFR, with a concomitant increase in plasma ANP. No significant changes were seen in plasma NE levels, but urinary NE excretion increased in controls and captopril-treated patients during exercise.", 
    "544": "The results suggest that prolonged low-intensity exercise has a substantially greater effect on renal hemodynamics in hypertensive renal failure patients than in healthy controls, with negligible changes in plasma NE levels. Verapamil treatment seems to ameliorate the renal effects of exercise on GFR in these patients, and this may in part be mediated via a stimulatory effect on ANP.",

    "547": "Lisinopril-hidrochlorothiazide (20/12.5 mg) reduced significantly SBP (24.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg) and DBP (14,3 +/- 0.7 mm Hg) (P<.001). Blood pressure control was only influenced by age (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71-0.92; P=.001). Pulse pressure was reduced in 10.4 +/- 4.3 mm Hg (P<.001). After 24 weeks of treatment, glycemic and lipidic profiles showed an improvement, as well as HbA1c in diabetic people.",

    "549": "Although certain classes of drugs appear to possess benefits apart from their blood-pressure lowering capability, reduction of blood pressure remains the single most important action of antihypertensive therapy. Calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) have long been recognized as potent agents for hypertension therapy. This is especially true for the prevention of stroke in hypertensive patients as evidenced from the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) and Systolic Hypertension in China (Syst-China) trials with a long acting dihydropyridine CCB. The same can be said for beta blockers in patients post myocardial infarction. However, most recent clinical trials have underscored the necessity of multiple drug therapy to achieve the goals of blood pressure reduction coupled with outcomes reduction. For example, the many recent large-scale clinical trials have required an average of three or more agents to achieve goal. Thus, the paradigm for hypertension management has been altered to determine the best treatment regimen rather than the best initial agent. While response rates to individual agents across a wide spectrum of patients vary little, not all drugs are equally suited as companion products. In this article, we discuss the most recent outcome trials with the long acting CCBs alone or in combination with other drugs. The evidence shows that calcium antagonists remain an important part of hypertension management, including in those individuals at risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular events.", 
    "550": "Traditionally, the term complex hypertension has been applied to patients who have clinical evidence of target organ damage. However, this definition can be expanded to include many hypertensive patients who either present without manifest disease but harbor silent concomitant organ damage, or belong to a high-risk group and are likely to develop such damage. Thus, the number of patients who deserve special consideration as complex patients is considerable. Various factors may contribute toward classifying a patient as having complex hypertension. These include severe hypertension, concomitant conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, orcongestive heart failure; and high-risk populations such as the elderly and African Americans. Recent evidence demonstrates that aggressive goal blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy is the key toward halting the progression of vascular disease. Although the choice of initial therapy seems less important than achieving goal BP, the drug selected must impart efficacy, organ protection, and tolerability. Combination therapy consisting of calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors seems to achieve these desirable effects. Several clinical trials have demonstrated these agents to have favorable effects on BP and organ protection even in complex hypertension, particularly when used in combination.", 
    "551": "It appears to be confirmed by international studies that the development of end-stage nephropathy, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity can be reduced to a large extent by achieving a target blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg in diabetes hypertension and 125/75 mmHg in diabetic nephropathy. Diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are all recommended agents with evidence \"A\" according to both international and national recommendations. The most efficient nephroprotection and simultaneous intensive and efficient blood pressure reduction can be achieved by ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers as basic agents. It is often required to use combination treatment to achieve the target blood pressure. In the predialysis stage, tight blood pressure control should be completed with balanced glucose metabolism, restricted protein intake, controlled salt and water metabolism, early treatment of metabolic acidosis and preparation for kidney substitution treatment. The patient and the treating physicians should work together in a coordinated way during the complex nephrology, diabetes, cardiology care to slow down the progress of the disease.", 
    "552": "Various cardiovascular drugs have been shown to have neuropsychiatric effects that can be harmful or therapeutically beneficial to patients. As an example, both sedation and mental depression have been described in patients receiving centrally acting antihypertensive drugs and beta-adrenergic blockers, related to their antiadrenergic actions. In contrast, because of these antiadrenergic actions, agents like clonidine have been used to treat opiate, alcohol, and nicotine withdrawal, while beta blockers have been used to treat symptoms of performance anxiety, migraine, and psychocardiac disorders. Some antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with delirium, and digitalis toxicity has been shown to cause hallucinations, mania, euphoria, and depression. The calcium-channel blocker verapamil has been used as an adjunctive treatment in patients with bipolar disorders. Since neuropsychiatric symptoms are seen in patients with cardiovascular disease, clinicians should be aware of the possible relationship between these symptoms and concurrent cardiovascular drug therapy.",

In this review the authors will concentrate on the developments within the last five to ten years. It will deal with what may be called medical advances. Recent advances in molecular genetics and defining the familial patterns have led to finding that certain genetic and molecular factors are linked to congenital heart disease and arrythmia, thus providing opportunity for improved genetic counseling and future gene therapy. Medical treatment of congenital heart disease targets not only the augmentation of ventricular contractility (positive inotropy) but also addresses the neuro-humoral derangement associated with it.

However, the effects of diabetes on cerebral blood flow and the role of vascular deficits in the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy are still unknown. The present study examined whether experimental diabetes is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow and whether treatment with enalapril can improve cerebral perfusion and function (blood flow and functional cerebral deficits). Streptozotocin-diabetic rats were treated with the ACE inhibitor enalapril (24 mg/kg) from onset of diabetes. After 14 weeks of diabetes, 12 enalapril treated and 12 untreated diabetic rats, and 12 nondiabetic age-matched control rats were tested in a spatial version of the Morris water maze. After 16 weeks of diabetes, in the same groups, blood flow in the hippocampus and thalamus was measured by hydrogen clearance microelectrode polarography. In a separate study, hippocampal long-term potentiation was measured after 26 weeks of diabetes. Water maze performance and hippocampal long-term potentiation were impaired in diabetic rats. Furthermore, blood flow in diabetic rats was reduced by 30% (P<0.001) in the hippocampus and by 37% (P<0.005) in the thalamus compared to nondiabetic controls. Enalapril treatment significantly improved water maze performance (P<0.05), hippocampal long term potentiation (P<0.05) and hippocampal blood flow (P<0.05). Cerebral perfusion is reduced in diabetic rats compared to controls. Treatment aimed at the vasculature can improve cerebral blood flow, deficits in Morris maze performance and long term potentiation. These findings suggest that vasculopathy plays a role in the development of cerebral dysfunction in diabetic rats.",

In contrast, the number of cardiomyocyte nuclei was comparable between untreated SHRs (48+/-4x10(6)) and WKY rats. After 4 weeks of valsartan or enalapril treatment, SHRs showed significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (>28%), left ventricular hypertrophy (>9%) and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area (>17%). Moreover, these treatments abolished non-cardiomyocyte hyperplasia in SHR left ventricle without affecting cardiomyocyte number, capillary density or number of capillary per cardiomyocyte nucleus. As a mechanism of cell deletion consistent with apoptosis induction, ventricles showed increased caspase-3 activation (>4.5-fold) as well as Bax to Bcl-2 protein ratio (>3.2-fold) within 2 weeks of valsartan or enalapril treatment. Immunohistological analysis revealed a significant increase in TUNEL-positive, lectin-negative non-cardiomyocytes, suggesting a rise in apoptotic interstitial fibroblasts in the left ventricle within 2 weeks of treatment with valsartan or enalapril (>63%), with a return to baseline (0.033+/-0.003%) at 4 weeks.

In TEM(-), progression of LVH and fibrosis and elevation of LV end diastolic pressure were observed at 19 weeks. Administration of temocapril from 13 weeks prevented the further progression of LVH and fibrosis, attenuated increases in myocardial stiffness constant and Tau, and prevented the development of DHF.

Immunohistochemistry demonstrated NF-kappaB activation mainly in cardiac myocytes. Treatment with the ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor trandolapril led to a further 2-fold increase in the activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 when compared to placebo-treated animals with the same MI size (P<0.001). Human failing hearts explanted at the time of heart transplantation exhibited marked nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in cardiac myocytes when compared to control hearts. NF-kappaB as well as AP-1 were both significantly activated in congestive heart failure due to ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy.",

Here we studied whether this process can be inhibited by the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat, a drug which causes simultaneous inhibition of both angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. Our hypothesis was that omapatrilat-treated rats would have less cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and less adverse cardiac remodeling compared to rats treated with selective inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, neutral endopeptidase or placebo. Myocardial infarction was produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Rats were randomized to receive omapatrilat, captopril, neutral endopeptidase inhibitor SQ-28603 or vehicle. Rats treated with omapatrilat and captopril had reduced cardiac BNP mRNA levels and less myocardial fibrosis by comparison with the vehicle-treated rats. However, omapatrilat was more effective than captopril in attenuating hypertrophy as measured by relative cardiac weight (3.0+/-0.2 vs. 3.8+/-0.2 mg/g, P<0.01) or by echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass (0.61+/-0.05 vs. 0.83+/-0.06 g, P<0.01). Myocardial apoptosis was elevated both in the infarction border zone (0.129+/-0.017%) and in the remote area (0.035+/-0.005%) still 4 weeks after myocardial infarction. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition proved to be important in the prevention of apoptosis since both omapatrilat and captopril reduced the number of apoptotic myocytes whereas selective neutral endopeptidase inhibitor SQ-28603 had no effect. In conclusion, myocardial apoptosis, remaining increased 4 weeks after myocardial infarction, was reduced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Vasopeptidase inhibition was more effective than selective angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in preventing adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction.",

This effect continued for at least 4 h after administration. The peptides possessing hypotensive activity in the chicken extract were examined by measuring the inhibitory activity (IC(50)) against angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). The inhibitory activity of the chicken extract was 1060 mg%, whereas the activity of the extract treated with an Aspergillus protease and gastric proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and intestinal juice) became stronger, reaching 1.1 mg%. Peptides in this hydrolysate of the extract were isolated by HPLC on a reversed-phase column, and their N-terminal sequences were analyzed. Three peptides possessed a common sequence, Gly-X-X-Gly-X-X-Gly-X-X, which was homologous with that of collagen.

All of these peptides showed dose-dependent ACEI activities. Using 50% inhibition (IC(50)) of captopril as 0.00781 microM for the reference, the IC(50) values of GSH, carnosine, homocarnosine, and anserine were determined to be 32.4 microM, 5.216 mM, 6.147 mM, and 6.967 mM, respectively. GSH or carnosine showed mixed noncompetitive inhibition against ACE. When 0.0164 mM GSH or 0.4098 mM carnosine was added, the apparent inhibition constant (K(i)) was 49.7 microM or 3.899 mM, respectively. Commercial glutathione-Sepharose 4 fast flow, GSH-coupled CNBr-activated and GSH-coupled EAH-activated Sepharose gels were used for ACE purification.

The microencapsulated Leu-Lys-Pro reduced significantly the systolic blood pressures of SHR by 45 mmHg and showed a prolonged duration, revealing the significant protective effect of encapsulation. d-phg-Leu-Arg-Pro showed a duration about 2 h shorter than that of the peptide without modification.

We conducted a prospective randomized, open labeled, crossover trial with theophylline, and an ACEI, fosinopril in nine stable renal transplant recipients with erythrocytosis. Aim of the study was to determine and compare the efficacy of these medications in stable renal transplant patients. At three months, compared to baseline, fosinopril significantly reduced the elevated hemoglobin (Hgb 17.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 14.9 +/- 1.4 gm/dL, p = 0.0023), and hematocrit levels (Hct 51.3 +/- 2.4 vs. 43.7 +/- 4.6%, p = 0.003). In contrast theophylline therapy was associated with a non-significant rise in hemoglobin (17.4 +/- 0.7 vs. 18.1 +/- 0.9gm/dL, p > 0.05) and hematocrit (52.4 +/- 2.7 vs. 54.7 +/- 3.9%, p > 0.05). With fosinopril compared to theophylline, there was a significant difference in the change in hemoglobin (baseline to three months 2.8 +/- 1.7 vs. -0.7 +/- 0.69 gm/dL respectively, p = 0.017), and the change in hematocrit (baseline to three months 9 +/- 6 vs. -2.3 +/- 2.7% respectively, p = 0.027). Four patients (44.4%) did not tolerate theophylline and did not complete the theophylline arm. To conclude, in our study, fosinopril effectively decreased the elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients with post transplant erythrocytosis, and was superior to theophylline, while theophylline was ineffective and poorly tolerated in this condition.",

Blood samples were collected through 24 hours postdose, and plasma was analyzed for quinapril and its active metabolite, quinaprilat. Quinapril was rapidly converted to quinaprilat. Quinaprilat concentrations generally peaked 1 to 2 hours postdose and declined with a mean half-life of 2.30 hours. Dosing on a mg/kg basis resulted in quinaprilat AUC and Cmax values that were generally comparable across the age range of patients in this study. The overall mean AUC0-infinity was 993 ng.h/mL (range: 533-1523), and mean Cmax was 260 ng/mL (range: 70.0-445.5). Quinaprilat CL/F correlated well with body size (body surface area or weight) and creatinine clearance (mL/min).

Patients were assigned to a target dose of losartan 50 mg/day and captopril 50 mg t.i.d., as tolerated. The primary end point was all-cause mortality and there were 499 (18%) and 447 (16%) deaths in the losartan and captopril group, respectively (p = 0.07). However, there were significantly more cardiovascular deaths with losartan (420, 15%) than with captopril (363, 13%; p = 0.03).

Several studies comparing angioplasty to lysis have been published. STOPAMI 2 evaluated myocardial salvage in the framework of primary angioplasty with placement of an endoprosthesis combined with abciximab infusion in comparison with half dose fibrinolysis associated with abciximab.

In the therapeutic field, a great disappointment came from the results of studies on omapatrilat. Despite its advantageous hemodynamic effects, this drug is not more efficacious than any ACE-inhibitor, but with much more side effects. New drugs (levosimendan, nesiritide) appear interesting in the acute heart failure. The short-term as well as long-term effects of cardiac resynchronization are confirmed.

This review discusses the role of myocardial apoptosis on the basis of findings from experimental studies in animals and from observational studies in humans with the purpose of assessing the clinical relevance, determinants and mechanisms of myocardial apoptosis and the potential therapeutic implications. A more profound understanding of the impact of myocardiocyte loss on prognosis and of the mechanisms involved may lead to an improved understanding of cardiac remodeling and possibly to an improved patient care. In fact, among the potential modulators of myocardial apoptosis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have already been shown to improve the prognosis and symptoms in patients with post-infarction heart failure, and a reduction in myocardial apoptosis could partly contribute to such a beneficial effect. Several other putative factors could also modulate myocardial apoptosis after AMI, and many are currently under intense investigation. In particular, the infarct-related artery patency late after AMI may be a major clinical determinant of myocardial apoptosis and clinical benefits deriving from an open artery (the \"open-artery hypothesis\"), such as a slowing down of the remodeling process and a reduced arrhythmic risk, could be due, at least in part, to a reduced apoptotic myocardiocyte loss.",

THF-gamma2 was metabolized through two steps that involved the detaching of N-terminal amino acid leucine followed by hydrolysis of the Lys(6)-Phe(7) bond. The THF-gamma2 cleavages were sensitive to aminopeptidase and metalloproteinase inhibitors. The degradation was completely blocked by amastatin and specific inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The cleavages occurred independently, with two different kinetics, faster for the N-terminal hydrolysis than for that of the Lys(6)-Phe(7) bond. Purified human plasma ACE was used to characterize the hydrolysis of Lys(6)-Phe(7) bond. The K(m) and K(cat) values for THF-gamma2 hydrolysis were 0.273 mM and 107 s(-1), respectively. The optimum of chloride concentration was 300 mM, while that of pH was 7.6.

    "653": "The plasma levels of des-aspartate-angiotensin I (DAA-I) in three models of hypertensive rats and hypertensive subjects were determined and compared with their normotensive controls. The rationale for the study was based on our earlier findings showing that DAA-I is a physiological angiotensin peptide that is involved in the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system. The determination was carried out by the technique of capillary electrophoresis. Plasma level of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III was also determined as a measurement of the status of the renin-angiotensin system in the different models of hypertension. DAA-I was found to be significantly lower in the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (46.6 +/- 2.5 pmol/l compared to 66.1 +/- 3.4 pmol/l for the normotensive control Wistar Kyoto rats), renal hypertensive rats (54.2 +/- 5.1 pmol/l compared to 72 +/- 2.5 pmol/l for the normotensive control Sprague-Dawley rats), and essential human hypertensive subjects (15.2 +/- 0.9 pmol/l compared to 19.5 +/- 2.5 pmol/l for the normotensive adult), whilst plasma concentration of angiotensin I and angiotensin II is reflective of the state of the renin-angiotensin system in the particular model of hypertension. When the SHR and human hypertensive subjects were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, the plasma level of DAA-I increased significantly. These findings suggest that the low plasma level of DAA-I could be a characteristic defect of the renin-angiotensin system in the two genetic models of hypertension (SHR and human essential hypertensive subjects). The increase of the nonapeptide following ACE inhibitor treatment could be an important hitherto unrecorded contributory factor to the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors in combating heart pathology.", 
    "654": "Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease characterized by pancreatic tissue edema, acinar cell necrosis, hemorrhage and inflammation of the damaged gland. It is believed that acinar cell injury is initiated by the activation of digestive zymogens inside the acinar cells, leading finally to the autodigestion of the pancreas. Previous study in our laboratory demonstrated that cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis was associated with an up-regulation of local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in rat pancreas. Therefore, the utilization of RAS inhibitors may provide a novel and alternative treatment for acute pancreatitis. By means of a rat model of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis, results from the present study showed that an intravenous injection of saralasin, an antagonist for angiotensin II receptors, at a dose of 40 microg/kg 30 min before the induction of acute pancreatitis significantly attenuated pancreatic edema. Results from the biochemical measurements showed that pretreatment with saralasin at a dose of 20 microg/kg markedly reduced pancreatic injury, as evidenced by the decreased activities of alpha-amylase and lipase in plasma. However, the same recipe of ramiprilat, a specific inhibitor for angiotensin-converting enzyme, at a dose of 20 microg/kg did not provide any protective effect against acute pancreatitis. On the contrary, pretreatment with ramiprilat at a dose 40 microg/kg enhanced cerulein-induced pancreatic injury. Results from histopathological analysis of these RAS inhibitors further confirmed with those results as obtained from biochemical analysis. These data indicate that administration of saralasin but not ramiprilat could be protective against acute pancreatitis and that activation of pancreatic RAS in acute pancreatitis may play a role in pancreatic tissue injury.",

ACE2 may play a unique role in the renin-angiotensin system and mediate cardiovascular and renal function. Here we report the discovery of ACE2 peptide inhibitors through selection of constrained peptide libraries displayed on phage. Six constrained peptide libraries were constructed and selected against FLAG-tagged ACE2 target. ACE2 peptide binders were identified and classified into five groups, based on their effects on ACE2 activity. Peptides from the first three classes exhibited none, weak, or moderate inhibition on ACE2. Peptides from the fourth class exhibited strong inhibition, with equilibrium inhibition constants (K(i) values) from 0.38 to 1.7 microm. Peptides from the fifth class exhibited very strong inhibition, with K(i) values < 0.14 microm. The most potent inhibitor, DX600, had a K(i) of 2.8 nm. Steady-state enzyme kinetic analysis showed that these potent ACE2 inhibitors exhibited a mixed competitive and non-competitive type of inhibition. They were not hydrolyzed by ACE2. Furthermore, they did not inhibit ACE activity, and thus were specific to ACE2. Finally, they also inhibited ACE2 activity toward its natural substrate angiotensin I, suggesting that they would be functional in vivo. As novel ACE2-specific peptide inhibitors, they should be useful in elucidation of ACE2 in vivo function, thus contributing to our better understanding of the biology of cardiovascular regulation. Our results also demonstrate that library selection by phage display technology can be a rapid and efficient way to discover potent and specific protease inhibitors.",

In the losartan group, 24-h proteinuria had decreased from 3.6 +/- 0.5 g to 2.3 +/- 0.5 g after 1 month, to 2.4 +/- 0.7 g after 6 months and to 1.9 +/- 0.7 g after 12 months. In the control group, a significant increase in proteinuria compared with the baseline value was noticed after 12 months. Proteinuria levels were significantly higher in the control group than in the losartan group after 6 and 12 months. Whilst total protein and albumin levels increased in the losartan group, they did not change significantly in the control group. The total protein levels after 6 and 12 months, and albumin levels after 6 months were significantly higher in the losartan group than in the control group. No significant change was observed between the baseline and the 12-month creatinine and CrCl levels of the groups when intra- and inter-group comparisons were made. Furthermore, serum cholesterol levels of the losartan group were reduced significantly. The changes in MAP values did not reach significant levels in either of the groups. There was no correlation between the percentage changes in MAP and in proteinuria of the losartan group after 12 months.",

The level of ACE is stable in human plasma, and only limited data are available on its regulation at the tissue level. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of two ACE inhibitors, moexipril and quinapril on tissue ACE activity. Adult male rats were treated intragastrically once daily for 6 days either with 2 mg/kg moexipril or quinapril. After single treatment, moexipril and quinapril effectively inhibited ACE activity in plasma and slightly in heart and aorta, whereas after 6 days of treatment they inhibited ACE activity in plasma (87% and 94%, respectively), lung (92% and 93%), myocardium (26% and 23%), kidney (21% and 20%), and aorta (39% and 40%), but not in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the two ACE-inhibitors also induced a significant increase in cardiac homogenates of 6-keto-PGF1alpha levels, an important index of PGI2 generation. To test whether the reduced effects of ACE inhibitors in heart and kidney were caused by a limited availability of the drugs, 100 microl of lung, heart and kidney homogenates from control rats were incubated in vitro with moexipril and quinapril immediately before assay. Both drugs were more effective in lung than heart and kidney homogenates, with inhibition values superimposable to those obtained in vivo. These results clearly indicate that inhibition of tissue ACE activity does not depend primarily on the availability of ACE inhibitors in each organ.",

Patients with ESRD are more frequently elderly and diabetic and are exposed to very high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The main aim of the FOSIDIAL study is to assess the efficacy and safety of fosinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in reducing the mortality and cardiovascular events in haemodialysis patients presenting with left ventricular hypertrophy. A total number of 397 patients are included in the study. They are aged 50-80 years (average 66.7 years) and have been undergoing haemodialysis for 4.8 years. All have left ventricular hypertrophy with cardiac mass index > 100 g/m2 in women and > 130 g/m2 in men, measured within 3 months prior to inclusion. Baseline cardiac mass index is 174 g/m2. After a 2 week placebo period, the patients are randomised into two groups receiving either fosinopril 5-20 mg/day, or a placebo for a duration of 24 months. The target dose is reached at the sixth, seventh or eighth week of treatment. Depending on tolerance, 300 patients reached the maximum recommended dose. Patients are subsequently assessed clinically every 3 months until the end of the study. The primary outcome is a composite endpoint of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events. Secondary endpoints are individual cardiovascular events, event-free survival, overall mortality and all-cause hospitalisations. The trial began in October 1998.

In the present study, we examined the effect of perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on the plasma level and synthesis of CGRP in 2 kidneys, 1-clip hypertensive rats (2K1C, Goldblatt). In the hypertension group, systolic blood pressure and mean artery pressure were raised, and the level of CGRP in plasma was slightly raised compared with control groups. Chronic treatment with losartan or perindopril significantly increased the plasma concentration of CGRP and the expression of CGRP mRNA in dorsal root ganglia in the 2K1C, Goldblatt hypertensive rats. These results suggest that the 2K1C, Goldblatt hypertensive model has a compensatory increase of sensory nerve actions, and that the depressor effects of perindopril or losartan may be related to stimulation of the synthesis and release of CGRP in the 2K1C, Goldblatt hypertensive rats.",

For the treatment of the latter, early peritoneal dialysis is recommended for in utero exposure to captopril and enalapril, although the outcome is poor. Early peritoneal dialysis has not previously been reported for lisinopril induced multiorgan failure. A case is reported in which treatment was given on postnatal day 3. The patient recovered from oligoanuria to almost normal renal function, and heart, brain, and musculoskeletal injury was reversible. This is despite relatively poor clearance of the drug through peritoneal dialysis. Analysis of the pharmacokinetic data suggests that haemodialysis or haemofiltration would be more efficacious for removal of the drug, and these treatments should be performed if available.",

The patient had had anemia and hypertension for 9 years, and proteinuria for 3 years. A renal biopsy specimen showed a remarkable mesangial expansion with Congo red-negative and periodic acid-Schiff-positive deposits. At the ultrastructural level, two forms of bundling fibers were found in the mesangium and subendothelial side of the glomerular basement membranes (GBM). The GBM itself appeared normal. Immunohistochemical investigation showed that the glomerular lesions were strongly reactive with both anti-collagen type-III and -V antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated collagen type V in both forms of bundling fibers. Despite therapy, her renal function declined. The clinical course and renal pathology of this case were in accordance with collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy except for the widespread expression of collagen type V. Collagen type V is a fibrillar collagen capable of forming banding fibrils.

    "696": "The Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.14.1, kininase II) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP, NEP 24.11) are mechanistically related metallopeptidases. They play a key role in the regulation of blood pressure, body fluid homeostasis and cell growth. Therefore, they are implicated in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, since these two metallopeptidases possess some subsite and substrate similarities, as indicated by their interaction with certain mercaptoalkanoyl inhibitors, they are regarded as an important common target for pharmacological inhibition with a single drug. MDL 100240 is a pro-drug that, upon conversion to MDL 100173, acts as a potent dual inhibitor of ACE and NEP with a balanced activity on both enzymes. Only very limited pharmacokinetic studies with MDL 100240 have been published. These studies used a high pressure liquid chromatography method with UV absorbance detection to quantify the drug. According to the studies in dogs the terminal t(1/2) of MDL 100173 was 35.7 h. The area under the curve for total MDL 100173 was nearly 10-fold greater than the sum of the areas under the curve for MDL 100240 and for unconjugated MDL 100173. These results support the hypothesis that MDL 100240 is hydrolyzed in plasma to the active thiol, MDL 100173, which is rapidly conjugated with endogenous plasma thiols thus providing a pathway for elimination. Studies in vivo in experimental models of hypertension and congestive heart failure confirmed the vasodilatory and natriuretic effects of MDL, which appear to be independent of the degree of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In addition, MDL 100240 showed an impressive effectiveness both in preventing and in regressing hypertension-induced vascular remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy. Accordingly, MDL 100240 is being developed for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and congestive heart failure. If the promises of this novel therapeutic strategy are fulfilled, clinical trials are expected to demonstrate advantages of MDL 100240 over pure ACE inhibitors.",

This report is restricted to 7674 participants with albuminuria data at baseline and at follow-up. Inclusion criteria were known vascular disease or diabetes plus one other cardiovascular risk factor, exclusion criteria included heart failure or known impaired left ventricular function, dipstick-positive proteinuria (>1+), and serum creatinine >2.3 mg/dl (200 microM). Baseline microalbuminuria predicted subsequent clinical proteinuria for the study participants overall (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 17.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6 to 24.4), in participants without diabetes (OR, 16.7; 95% CI, 8.6 to 32.4), and in participants with diabetes (OR, 18.2; 95% CI, 12.4 to 26.7).

The pattern of Fos-ir in the brain after furosemide was similar to that seen after peripheral injection of ANG II. Mice became hypovolemic after subcutaneous injection of polyethylene glycol (PEG), showed large increases in PRA, aldosterone, and water intake, but did not show sodium appetite.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have well-known nephroprotective properties and may prevent cyclosporine A (CYA)-induced hypertension. Angiotensin receptor 1 antagonists have similar properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate if losartan or enalapril could be administered with CYA to reduce its nephrotoxic effect in uremic rats. The studies were performed on the following groups of rats: group I--control; group II--control rats + losartan; group III--control rats + CYA; group IV uremic rats; group V--uremic rats + losartan; group VI--uremic rats + CYA; group VII--uremic rats + losartan + CYA, group VIII--control rats + enalapril; group IX--control rats + enalapril + CYA; group X - uremic rats + enalapril; group XI--uremic rats + enalapril + CYA. Pretreatment with CYA, losartan or enalapril in uremic rats resulted in a significant increase in urea and creatinine levels and a decrease in hematocrit. The same effect was observed when uremic rats were given CYA + losartan or CYA + enalapril. Pretreatment with losartan was associated with the increase in the level of CYA much higher than with CYA treatment alone. Similarly, pretreatment with enalapril resulted in a significant increase in CYA concentration in both groups of rats given CYA: uremic and non-uremic. Results of our study show that the treatment with cyclosporine and a combination of losartan or enalapril results in an increase in creatinine and urea levels and a decrease in hematocrit.

The purposes of the current study were to investigate the progressive renal failure of the rats with surgical renal mass reduction (RMR) and the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril, and to document correlation of several factors associated with progressive renal failure. Rats were subtotal (5/6) nephrectomized by resection of the renal poles and sham-operated. The functional, histological and haematological changes of the rats were studied for up to 10 weeks. After 2 weeks of RMR, oral administration of lisinopril (10 mg kg(-1) per day) was performed for 8 weeks. RMR resulted in progressive renal failure with proteinuria, monocyte/macrophage (ED1+) infiltration, anaemia as assessed by haemoglobin and haematocrit (Htc), renal hypertrophy as assessed by left kidney to body weight ratio (BKW/BW), and renal fibrosis as assessed by glomerular lesions and tubulointerstitial changes. Lisinopril exhibited renoprotection with antiproteinuric effect and inhibition of monocyte/macrophage (ED1+) infiltration. However, beneficial effect of lisinopril on anaemia was not observed. At 10 weeks after surgery, severity of proteinuria positively correlated with plasma creatinine (Pcr), BKW/BW, histological damage, and systolic blood pressure, and negatively correlated with haemoglobin. Severity of tubulointerstitial changes positively correlated with Pcr and blood urea nitrogen, and negatively correlated with haemoglobin and Htc. Moreover, monocyte/macrophage (ED1+) infiltration positively correlated with severity of proteinuria and tubulointerstitial changes. These findings strongly support that proteinuria, monocyte/macrophage infiltration and renal fibrosis appear to play principal roles in the progressive renal failure with anaemia and renoprotection of ACE inhibition may be mediated by multiple actions of ACE inhibitor. The present study confirms that rats with RMR is useful to explore target molecules for renoprotective drugs and evaluate renoprotective effect of new molecular entities.",

    "727": "HCA rings were mounted in organ baths, and concentration-response curves to angiotensin II, angiotensin I, and the chymase-specific substrate Pro(11)-D-Ala(12)-angiotensin I (PA-angiotensin I) were constructed. All angiotensins displayed similar efficacy. For a given vasoconstriction, bath (but not interstitial) angiotensin II during angiotensin I and PA-angiotensin I was lower than during angiotensin II, indicating that interstitial (and not bath) angiotensin II determines vasoconstriction. PA-angiotensin I increased interstitial angiotensin II less efficiently than angiotensin I. Separate inhibition of ACE (with captopril) and chymase (with C41 or chymostatin) shifted the angiotensin I concentration-response curve approximately 5-fold to the right, whereas a 10-fold shift occurred during combined ACE and chymase inhibition. Chymostatin, but not captopril and/or C41, reduced bath angiotensin II and abolished PA-Ang I-induced vasoconstriction. Perfused HCA segments, exposed luminally or adventitially to angiotensin I, released angiotensin II into the luminal and adventitial fluid, respectively, and this release was blocked by chymostatin.", 
    "728": "Both ACE and chymase contribute to the generation of functionally active angiotensin II in HCAs. However, because angiotensin II loss in the organ bath is chymase-dependent, ACE-mediated conversion occurs more efficiently (ie, closer to AT(1) receptors) than chymase-mediated conversion.", 
    "729": "Endothelial dysfunction is a systemic disorder and a key variable in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its complications. Current evidence suggests that endothelial status is not determined solely by the individual risk factor burden but rather, may be regarded as an integrated index of all atherogenic and atheroprotective factors present in an individual, including known as well as yet-unknown variables and genetic predisposition. Endothelial dysfunction reflects a vascular phenotype prone to atherogenesis and may therefore serve as a marker of the inherent atherosclerotic risk in an individual. In line with this hypothesis, dysfunction of either the coronary or peripheral vascular endothelium was shown to constitute an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, providing valuable prognostic information additional to that derived from conventional risk factor assessment. Interventions like risk factor modification and treatment with various drugs, including statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may improve endothelial function and thereby, potentially prognosis. Hence, given its reversibility and granted the availability of a diagnostic tool to identify patients at risk and to control the efficacy of therapy in clinical practice, endothelial dysfunction may be an attractive primary target in the effort to optimize individualized therapeutic strategies to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "730": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) can enhance sympathetic neurotransmission by acting on (AT1) receptors that are located on sympathetic nerve terminals. We investigated presynaptic blockade by the selective AT1-receptor antagonist irbesartan in pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). We compared the presynaptic inhibitory dose with that required for the blockade of AT1-receptors on vascular smooth muscle in both strains. To investigate blockade of presynaptic AT1-receptors, we studied the effect of irbesartan on the sequelae of electric stimulation of the thoraco-lumbar sympathetic outflow (0.25-8 Hz). To study the interaction between postsynaptic AT1-blockers and alpha-adrenoceptors, the effects of irbesartan on pressor responses to exogenous noradrenaline (NA) were established. Additionally, we studied the effect of irbesartan on dose-response curves for the vasoconstriction induced by exogenous Ang II. Pressor responses to electrical stimulation of thoracolumbar sympathetic neurones, to exogenous Ang II, as well as to (NA) were enhanced in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with WKY. The stimulation-induced rise in DBP could be dose-dependently reduced by irbesartan (0.3-10 mg/kg) in both SHR and WKY. The pIC50 values (doses which suppress the rise in DBP by 50% compared with control) were 5.60 +/- 0.09 and 5.72 +/- 0.08 for SHR and WKY, respectively (P > 0.05). In SHR, no effect of irbesartan (3 mg/kg) on pressor responses to exogenous NA was observed. In contrast, in WKY, irbesartan (3 mg/kg) caused a rightward shift of the dose-response curve to exogenous NA. Irbesartan (0.3-3 mg/kg) caused a depression of E(max) values and a rightward shift of the dose-response curves to exogenous Ang II in a similar fashion in both SHR and WKY. From these results we conclude that both in SHR and in WKY, Ang II exerts a facilitatory effect on sympathetic neurotransmission, which is mediated by prejunctional AT1-receptors in both strains. Irbesartan displays comparable sympatho-inhibitory potency in the normotensive and hypertensive pithed rat preparations. A facilitatory effect via postsynaptically located AT1-receptors on alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated responses exists in WKY, but not in SHR. In both strains the required dose to inhibit presynaptic effects is somewhat higher than the dose required to inhibit postsynaptic effects. No differences, therefore, seem to exist between the two strains regarding the affinity of irbesartan for pre- and postjunctional AT1-receptors, respectively.", 
    "731": "Heart failure remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, despite major advances in therapy. Angiotensin II, the principal mediator of the renin-angiotensin system, exerts both short-term (e.g., hemodynamic, renal) and long-term (e.g., inflammation, cardiac remodeling) effects in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. The effects of angiotensin II appear to be more completely inhibited by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which act at the subtype 1 receptor level, than by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors because pathways other than that of ACE contribute to the generation of angiotensin II. Evidence demonstrates that ARBs, when added to conventional treatment for patients with heart failure, are associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality as well as an improvement in quality of life. Clinical trials of ARB therapy indicate that these agents are generally well tolerated, both alone and in combination with other neurohormonal inhibitors. The current role of ARBs in heart failure is as an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate therapy with an ACE inhibitor. A number of ongoing clinical studies are likely to further define or expand the role of ARBs in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "732": "Patients with stage II hypertensive disease have been shown to derive apparent benefit from treatment with a combination of the beta-adrenoblocker nebivolol and inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme enap that was evidenced by improvement in hemodynamics, in echocardiographic characteristics promoting a decline in the activity of the basic enzyme of the tissue formation angiotensin II chimase and an increase in the level of its most important inhibitor alpha-2-macroglobulin.", 
    "733": "With the use of in vitro receptor autoradiography, this study aims at determining whether the higher level of kinin B(2) receptor density in the spinal cord of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is secondary to arterial hypertension and whether chronic treatment with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) can regulate neuronal B(1) and B(2) receptors. SHR received, from the age of 4 wk, one of the two ACEI (lisinopril or zofenopril, 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or for comparison, the selective AT(1) antagonist (losartan, 20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) in their drinking water for a period of 4, 12, and 20 wk. Age-matched untreated SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were used as controls. B(2) receptor binding sites in most laminae were higher in SHR than in WKY from the age of 8 to 24 wk. Whereas B(1) receptor binding sites were significantly present in young SHR and WKY, they were barely detectable in adult rats. ACEI (16 and 24 wk) and AT(1) antagonist (24 wk) enhanced the number of B(2) without changing B(1) receptor binding sites. However, at 8 wk the three treatments significantly increased B(1) and decreased B(2) receptors in lamina I. It is concluded that 1) the higher density of B(2) receptors in the spinal cord of SHR is not due to hypertension, 2) kinin receptors are regulated differently by ACEI in neuronal and vascular tissues, and 3) aging may have a profound impact on levels of B(1) and B(2) receptors in the rat spinal cord.", 
    "734": "Bradykinin is a vasoactive peptide that has been shown to increase the permeability of the cerebral microvasculature to blood-borne macromolecules. The two zinc metalloendopeptidases EC (EP 24.15) and EC (EP 24.16) degrade bradykinin in vitro and are highly expressed in the brain. However, the role that these enzymes play in bradykinin metabolism in vivo remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of EP 24.15 and EP 24.16 in the regulation of bradykinin-induced alterations in microvascular permeability. Permeability of the cerebral microvasculature was assessed in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats by measuring the clearance of 70-kDa FITC dextran from the brain. Inhibition of EP 24.15 and EP 24.16 by the specific inhibitor N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Aib-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (JA-2) resulted in the potentiation of bradykinin-induced increases in cerebral microvessel permeability. The level of potentiation was comparable to that achieved by the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme. These findings provide the first evidence of an in vivo role for EP 24.15/EP 24.16 in brain function, specifically in regulating alterations in microvessel permeability induced by exogenous bradykinin.", 
    "735": "Because renin and angiotensin I (ANG I) level are high in the renal circulation, the conversion of ANG I is a critical step in the regulation of glomerular hemodynamics. We studied this conversion by investigating the effect of ANG I on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in rat juxtamedullary glomerular afferent and efferent arterioles (AA and EA, respectively). Two types of EA were considered, thin EA and muscular EA, terminating as peritubular capillaries and vasa rectae, respectively. In all arterioles, ANG I elicited [Ca(2+)](i) elevations. Maximal responses of 171 +/- 28 (AA), 183 +/- 7 (muscular EA), and 78 +/- 11 nM (thin EA) (n = 6), similar to those obtained with ANG II, were observed with 100 nM ANG I. The EC(50) values were 20 times higher for ANG I than for ANG II in AA (10.2 vs. 0.5) and muscular EA (6.8 vs. 0.4 nM) and 150 times higher in thin EA (15.2 vs. 0.1 nM). ANG I effect was blocked by losartan, indicating that AT(1) receptors were involved. The ANG-converting enyzme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril inhibited the maximal response to ANG I in AA and muscular EA by 75 +/- 9% (n = 13) and 70 +/- 7% (n = 13), respectively, but had no effect in thin EA (n = 14). The serine protease inhibitor aprotinin, the chymase inhibitor chymostatin, and the cysteine protease inhibitors E64 and leupeptin had no effect on ANG I action. These data show that ANG I effects are mainly mediated by ACE in AA and muscular EA but not in thin EA. The lisinopril-insensitive response may be related to conversion by unknown enzyme(s) and/or to activation of AT(1) receptors by ANG I.",

The ability of either of these drug classes to reduce blood pressure in the ESRD patient is well accepted; however, there is considerably less information available to guide the clinician in the safe and effective use of these drugs in the ESRD patient with congestive heart failure and/or coronary artery disease. Head-to-head studies in the ESRD patient are lacking for both drug classes. Several pharmacokinetic factors can influence the selection of these drugs, including dialysability and the propensity for systemic accumulation. ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and ARBs are recognised as having a range of nonpressor effects that are pertinent to patients with ESRD. Such effects include their ability to decrease both thirst drive and erythropoiesis. These drug classes, though, are distinguishable by the unique adverse effect profile for ACE-Is. As is the case in patients without renal failure, ESRD patients can experience cough and, less frequently, angioneurotic oedema with ACE-Is. In the ESRD population, so-called anaphylactoid dialyser reactions can occur in conjunction with ACE-I use. The use of a drug from within the ARB class carries both less risk and permits a compound with a preferred pharmacokinetic profile limited dialysability and minimal systemic accumulation to be administered. These attributes would favour the increased use of ARBs in this population.", 
    "764": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin II (Ang II), AT(1)-receptor blockers (ARB) is the cornerstone of renoprotective therapy. Still, the number of patients with end-stage renal disease is increasing worldwide, prompting the search for improved renoprotective strategies. In spite of proven efficacy at group level, the long-term renoprotective effect of RAAS blockade displays a marked between-patient heterogeneity, which is closely linked to between-patient differences in the intermediate parameters of blood pressure, proteinuria and renal haemodynamics. Of note, the between-patient differences by far exceed the between-regimen differences, and thus may provide a novel target for exploration and intervention. The responsiveness to RAAS blockade appears to be an individual characteristic as demonstrated by studies applying a rotation-schedule design. The type and severity of renal disease, obesity, insulin-resistance, glycaemic control, and genetic factors may all be involved in individual differences in responsiveness, as well as dietary factors, such as dietary sodium and protein intake. Several strategies, such as dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy, dose-titration for proteinuria, and dual RAAS blockade with ACE-I and ARB, can improve the response to therapy at a group level. However, when analysed for their effect in individuals, it appears that these measures do not allow poor responders to catch up with the good responders, i.e. in spite of their efficacy at group level, the available measures are usually not sufficient to overcome individual resistance to RAAS blockade. We conclude that between-patient differences in responsiveness to renoprotective intervention should get specific attention as a target for intervention. Unravelling of the underlying mechanisms may allow development of specific intervention. Based on the currently available data, we propose that response-based treatment schedules, with a multidrug approach titrated and adapted at individual responses rather than fixed treatment schedules, may provide a fruitful strategy for more effective renoprotection.",

Kallikrein-like activity hydrolyzing a peptide Pro-Phe-Arg-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide was detected in the culture medium of HUVEC and was inhibited by aprotinin but not by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Western blotting of HUVEC medium using anti-human tissue kallikrein antibodies demonstrated the release of tissue kallikrein from HUVEC, and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by Southern blotting revealed the expression of tissue kallikrein mRNA in HUVEC. HUVEC metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine released radioactive proteins corresponding to tissue kallikrein. RT-PCR also showed the expression of low-molecular-weight kininogen (L-kininogen) mRNA in HUVEC. The cGMP levels in HUVEC were significantly elevated by the incubation with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, and the elevation was completely inhibited by aprotinin or bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, FR172357.

Nine patients in each group were on treatment with enalapril at baseline with a median daily dose of 5 mg in both the high (5-10) and low (2.5-20) concentration group. At 3 months' follow-up, the dose was 10 (2.5-30) and 1.9 (1.25-5) mg (P < 0.0001), respectively.

To better identify and characterize the clinical and laboratory features of hypertensive XLH children, we reviewed the medical records of 41 XLH children, all treated with phosphate and vitamin D analogues. Eight children, who were originally normotensive, developed hypertension during the 2nd decade of life. At diagnosis of hypertension all had persistent secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism (HPTD), defined as high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) for 12 months or longer. Seven had nephrocalcinosis (NC). Analysis of data showed that of 11 children with HPTD, 8 developed hypertension compared with 0 among 30 without HPTD (P<0.001). Of 40 children studied, 18 had NC that was significantly associated with both HPTD (P<0.01) and hypertension (P<0.025). At diagnosis of hypertension, serum calcium was elevated in 2. Plasma renin activity was high in 3 of 4 patients in whom it was measured. Doppler ultrasonography or renal scan was normal in the 5 children studied. Early echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy in only 2 of 5 children studied. In 3 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy, hypertension persisted and 1 progressed to renal failure. Serum creatinine remained normal in all others. Successful treatment of hypertension consisted of beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and Ca channel blockers as monotherapy or in combination. We conclude that hypertension in treated XLH children is closely associated with HPTD. Emphasis should therefore be placed on prevention of the development of HPTD as a complication of XLH treatment, and close monitoring for hypertension in those who do develop HPTD.",

After three days of a standardized diet, 0.154 mol/l saline was infused at 8 ml/kg/h for 4 h. Blood pressure, hormones, and renal function were monitored for 48 h. After four months, the same subjects received captopril (225 mg/day), and the protocol was repeated.",

Blood pressure increased only in the HTRs (+16 +/- 5/9 +/- 3 mm Hg) and remained elevated for 48 h (p < or = 0.05). After captopril, sodium elimination was comparable in the liver (87 +/- 13%) and heart groups (86 +/- 12%) and blood pressure did not change in either group. CONCLUSIONS; Heart transplant recipients have blunted diuretic and natriuretic responses to volume expansion that is mediated by their inability to suppress the RAAS. Pharmacologic suppression of the RAAS normalized defects in blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. These findings indicate that hypertension in HTRs is caused, in part, by a failure to reflexively suppress the RAAS when these patients become hypervolemic.",

In all, 96 centres participated in this randomised, parallel groups, controlled study. A total of 829 patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension were randomised, and 790 were eligible for the analysis of efficacy (intention to treat). Patients of both sexes, aged 18-75 years, newly diagnosed or untreated during the last month were included in the study if their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > or =95 and < or =114 mmHg. The starting doses of the drugs were delapril 30 mg+indapamide 1.25 mg tablets o.d. or captopril 50 mg+hydrolchlorothiazide 15 mg tablets o.d.

We investigated the effects of an extended-release nitrate preparation and of 2 angiotensin II (AII) inhibitors (an AII receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor) on the aortic pulse wave contour and systemic blood pressure in hypertensive subjects with high augmentation index caused by exaggerated pulse wave reflection. Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover studies were carried out in a total of 16 elderly patients with systolic hypertension resistant to conventional antihypertensive therapy. In 1 study, pharmacodynamic responses to single doses of placebo, isosorbide mononitrate, eprosartan, and captopril were determined; in the other, single-dose isosorbide mononitrate and placebo were compared in subjects treated with AII inhibitors at baseline. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometry and pulse wave components by applanation tonometry at the radial artery. All 3 agents were shown to decrease brachial systolic blood pressure, aortic systolic blood pressure, and aortic pulse pressure. Qualitative effects on the aortic pulse wave contour differed: augmentation index was not significantly altered by either captopril or eprosartan but was decreased (P<0.0001) by approximately 50% of the placebo value with isosorbide mononitrate in both study groups. We propose that isosorbide mononitrate corrected the magnified wave reflection in systolic hypertension of these elderly patients by an effect that was distinct from that exercised by either acute or chronic AII inhibition.", 
    "837": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade has been shown to protect against renal damage in salt-supplemented, stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp). Based on intermittent tail-cuff blood pressure (BP) measurements, it has been claimed that such protection is BP-independent and mediated by a blockade of the direct tissue-damaging effects of angiotensin and/or aldosterone. BP radiotelemetry was performed for 8 weeks in approximately 10-week-old male SHRsp who received a standard diet and either tap water (n=10) or 1% NaCl to drink. Saline-drinking SHRsp were either left untreated (n=12), received enalapril (50 mg/L) in drinking fluid (n=9), or had subcutaneous implantation of time-release 200-mg pellets of aldactone (n=10). The average systolic BP (mean+/-SEM) during the final 3 weeks was significantly higher (P<0.05) in untreated saline-drinking (215+/-6 mm Hg) SHRsp but not aldactone-treated (198+/-4 mm Hg) or enalapril-treated treated SHRsp (173+/-1 mm Hg), as compared with tap water-drinking SHRsp (197+/-3 mm Hg). Histological renal damage scores at 8 weeks paralleled the BP in all groups, with an excellent correlation (r=0.8, P<0.001, n=41). Moreover, a renal damage score of >5 was only observed in SHRsp whose average systolic BP during the final 3 weeks exceeded 200 mm Hg, indicating a threshold relation with BP. These data show that protection by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in this model is BP-dependent and mediated by preventing the severe increases in BP seen in untreated salt-supplemented SHRsp and further underscore the limitations of interpretations based on conventional tail-cuff BP measurements.",

Acute intravenous infusion of ET-1 (10 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) for 60 min significantly increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 125 +/- 8 to 145 +/- 8 mmHg (P < 0.05) and significantly decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 0.31 +/- 0.09 to 0.13 +/- 0.05 ml x min(-1) x 100 g kidney wt(-1). Pretreatment with enalapril (10 mg/kg iv) before ET-1 infusion inhibited the increase in MAP (121 +/- 4 vs. 126 +/- 4 mmHg) before and during ET-1 infusion, respectively (P < 0.05) without blocking the effect of ET-1 on GFR. In contrast, neither omapatrilat (30 mg/kg) nor candesartan (10 mg/kg) had any effect on ET-1-induced increases in MAP or decreases in GFR. To determine whether the effect of enalapril was due to the decrease in angiotensin II or increase in kinin formation, rats were given REF-000359 (1 mg/kg iv), a selective B(2) receptor antagonist, with or without enalapril before ET-1 infusion. REF-000359 completely blocked the effect of enalapril on ET-1 infusion (MAP was 117 +/- 5 vs. 135 +/- 5 mmHg before and during ET-1 infusion, respectively, P < 0.05). REF-000359 alone had no effect on the response to ET-1 infusion (MAP was 117 +/- 4 vs. 144 +/- 4 mmHg before and during ET-1 infusion, respectively, P < 0.05). REF-000359 with or without enalapril had no significant effect on the ability of ET-1 infusion to decrease GFR. These findings support the hypothesis that decreased catabolism of bradykinin and its subsequent vasodilator activity oppose the actions of ET-1 to increase MAP.", 
    "839": "Primary cultures of rat type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) or human AEC-derived A549 cells, when exposed to bleomycin (Bleo), exhibited concentration-dependent apoptosis detected by altered nuclear morphology, fragmentation of DNA, activation of caspase-3, and net cell loss over time. In both cell culture models, exposure to Bleo caused time-dependent increases in angiotensinogen (ANGEN) mRNA. Antisense oligonucleotides against ANGEN mRNA inhibited Bleo-induced apoptosis of rat AEC or A549 cells by 83 and 84%, respectively (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), and prevented Bleo-induced net cell loss. Apoptosis of rat AECs or A549 cells in response to Bleo was inhibited 91% by the ANG-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or 82%, respectively, by neutralizing antibodies specific for ANG II (both P < 0.01). Antagonists of ANG receptor AT(1) (losartan, L-158809, or saralasin), but not an AT(2)-selective blocker (PD-123319), inhibited Bleo-induced apoptosis of either rat AECs (79%, P < 0.01) or A549 cells (83%, P < 0.01) and also reduced the activity of caspase-3 by 52% (P < 0.05). These data indicate that Bleo, like Fas(L) or TNF-alpha, induces transactivation of ANG synthesis de novo that is required for AEC apoptosis. They also support the theory that ANG system antagonists have potential for the blockade of AEC apoptosis in situ.", 
    "840": "The effects of a 3-day water deprivation were studied in adult female rats in order to know what are the different zones of the adrenal gland and the hormonal factors involved in the growth and the activity of the adrenal gland. Water deprivation significantly increased plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma Angiotensin II (AII), vasopressin (AVP), epinephrine, aldosterone and corticosterone concentrations but did not modify the plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) level. Water deprivation significantly increased the absolute weight of the adrenal capsule containing the zona glomerulosa without modification of the density of cells per area unit suggesting that the growth of the adrenal capsule was due to a cell hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa. Water deprivation significantly increased the density of AII type 1 (AT(1)) receptors in the adrenal capsule but did not modify the density of AII type 2 (AT(2)) receptors in the adrenal capsule and core containing the zona fasciculata, the zona reticularis and the medulla. The treatment of dehydrated female rats with captopril, which inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in order to block the production of AII, significantly decreased the absolute weight of the adrenal capsule, plasma aldosterone and the density of AT(1) receptors in the adrenal capsule. The concentration of corticosterone in the plasma, the density of AT(2) receptors and the density of cells per unit area in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal capsule were not affected by captopril-treatment. In conclusion, these results suggest that AII seems to be the main factor involved in the stimulation of the growth and the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal capsule containing the zona glomerulosa during water deprivation. The low level of plasma ACTH is not involved in the growth of the adrenal gland but is probably responsible for the secretion of corticosterone by the zona fasciculata.", 
    "841": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a fundamental role in the development of atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular events. Traditionally, the pathologic effects of the RAAS were assumed to result from vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II, and salt and water retention due to aldosterone. However, these hormones also have powerful trophic effects, stimulating increased mass in both the arterial wall and left ventricle. In addition, angiotensin II and aldosterone predispose to vascular inflammation, thrombosis, oxidative stress, and sudden cardiac death. Therapy directed at RAAS overactivity is essential for normalizing the prognosis of most patients with atherosclerosis. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor improves the prognosis of patients with atherosclerosis and/or diabetes even in the setting of normal baseline blood pressure. Angiotensin receptor blocking agents also improve cardiovascular structure and prognosis. Although these agents are better tolerated than ACE inhibitors, they do not appear to be as effective in reducing event rates. Aldosterone receptor blocking agents also improve cardiovascular structure, function, and prognosis. Aldosterone receptor blockers appear to provide additive benefit when used in conjunction with either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.", 
    "842": "The treatment of patients with stable angina has three goals: 1) minimize or eliminate ischemia (silent or symptomatic), 2) reduce morbidity, and 3) decrease mortality. Surgical and now angiographic revascularization procedures are increasingly popular approaches to the management of these patients. The results of randomized, controlled trials suggest that revascularization may not improve survival, but is useful to improve symptoms and exercise capacity. However, these trials are of limited value because they do not reflect current state of the art revascularization techniques or optimal medical management. Because many of these studies were conducted more than a decade ago, patients were recruited before the survival benefits of antiplatelet therapy, b-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aggressive lipid lowering were accepted. The Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial should help us determine the best approach in these patients. It is a multicenter, randomized trial comparing aggressive medical therapy with aggressive medical therapy with current state of the art percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with stable coronary disease. The COURAGE protocol targets global risk reduction emphasizing 1) lifestyle modification, 2) maximal use of drugs to lower blood pressure to Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) VI goals, 3) maximal use of drugs to lower cholesterol to below National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III goals for secondary prevention, and 4) maximal use of drug to alleviate anginal symptoms with or without the best interventional devices to conduct PCI."
