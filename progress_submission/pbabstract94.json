    "0": "Our objectives were to investigate the extent to which both exogenously administered and endogenously released arginine vasopressin (AVP) exert a direct, vasoactive influence on the pulmonary circulation of conscious dogs. Multipoint pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were constructed during normoxia in conscious dogs by stepwise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava (IVC) to reduce Q. In intact dogs, AVP infusion (7.6 ng X kg-1 X min-1 iv) increased (P less than 0.01) plasma AVP from 2.3 +/- 0.4 to 280 +/- 23 pg/ml, and increased (P less than 0.01) the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient (pulmonary arterial pressure minus pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, PAP-PCWP) over the entire range of Q studied. Following administration of autonomic nervous system antagonists and a converting-enzyme inhibitor, exogenous AVP again increased (P less than 0.01) PAP-PCWP over the entire range of Q. Generation of P/Q plots via IVC constriction resulted in systemic hypotension (58 +/- 4 mmHg) and a concomitant increase (P less than 0.01) in endogenous AVP release from 2.1 +/- 0.2 to 109 +/- 22 pg/ml. Following administration of the specific AVP receptor antagonist [d(CH2)5]AVP (10 micrograms/kg iv), systemic arterial pressure, but not PAP - PCWP, was decreased to significantly lower levels as Q was reduced during IVC constriction. A similar response was observed in dogs pretreated with the neurohumoral blockers. Thus exogenous administration of AVP results in active, non-flow-dependent pulmonary vasoconstriction. This effect is not dependent on reflex activation of the autonomic nervous system or on the increased production of angiotensin II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells in culture were used to assess the influence of cyclic nucleotides, isoproterenol (beta adrenergic agonist), and theophylline (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) on angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of the cells and culture medium. Dibutyryl cAMP (10(-3) M) but not cAMP or dibutyryl cGMP stimulated angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of cells in culture approximately 50-100% but had little influence on ACE activity of the medium. Theophylline at 10(-3) M concentration produced a three- to fourfold stimulation of both cellular and medium ACE activity. Isoproterenol by itself had no effect on cellular ACE activity but produced a stimulatory effect at 10(-7)-10(-5) M concentration after pretreatment of cells for 24 hr with 10(-4) M theophylline. The results support the concept that ACE activity of endothelial cells is influenced by the cyclic AMP system. ACE activity in cells and that released into medium may be under different regulatory controls.", 
    "2": "This study was designed to examine the contribution of bradykinin to the depressor effect of different antihypertensive drugs in two-kidney renovascular hypertensive rats, using a new specific antagonist of bradykinin. First, the inhibitory capacity of this peptide for exogenously injected bradykinin (75-200 ng) was tested. An inhibition of the vasodepressor action of bradykinin by over 50% was found when the bradykinin inhibitor was infused at a rate of 40 micrograms/min, with little difference at higher rates of infusion. This inhibitor then was infused in three groups of renovascular hypertensive rats after their blood pressure had been decreased by pretreatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (MK 421), saralasin, or sodium nitroprusside, respectively. Infusion of the inhibitor produced an immediate 30% increase in blood pressure only in the enalapril-treated group. These results indicate that bradykinin is involved in the decrease of blood pressure produced by converting enzyme inhibition in experimental renovascular hypertension.", 
    "3": "Serum levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 48), osteoarthritis (OA) (n = 11), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 24), psoriatic arthritis (n = 12), and Beh\u00e7et's syndrome (n = 20) were not significantly different from those of normal controls (n = 26). Synovial fluid ACE activity was lower in OA than in RA but was similar when corrected for protein levels. An increase in serum ACE concentration in patients with RA receiving captopril therapy is in agreement with previous results. There was some correlation of ACE with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) but not with clinical indices in captopril treated patients. It is suggested that the beneficial actions of captopril in the treatment of RA are not due to its activity as an ACE inhibitor, but more probably a result of captopril being an aliphatic thiol.", 
    "4": "A patient with scleroderma renal crisis is described. At presentation he had severe hypertension, deteriorating renal function, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, and elevated levels of renin, aldosterone and noradrenaline. Enalapril controlled blood pressure, stabilized renal function, lowered aldosterone and noradrenaline levels, and improved peripheral circulation. It appears that converting-enzyme inhibitors can favourably alter the outlook of this otherwise fatal disorder.", 
    "5": "Captopril (1-5 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect the vasodepressor responses to substance P (1-30 micrograms/kg, i.v.) in anaesthetized rats. Substance P (100 micrograms/kg, s.c.) produced significant algesia in mice; this was not potentiated by the smaller doses of captopril (1-2 mg/kg, i.p.), but was instead antagonized by the high dose (5 mg/kg, i.p.). It is concluded that captopril does not have any influence on substance P degradation in vivo since the pharmacological actions of the undecapeptide are not enhanced after captopril treatment.", 
    "6": "Blood pressure, diameter, volume distensibility, and compliance of brachial artery were measured noninvasively in patients with sustained essential hypertension before and after Captopril in 11 patients and before and after isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in 11 other patients. Both drugs caused a similar significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p less than 0.001) and increase in arterial compliance (p less than 0.001), defined as the product of arterial volume by distensibility. ISDN increased arterial compliance through a dominant increase in arterial diameter (0.524 +/- 0.029 vs. 0.455 +/- 0.022 cm; p less than 0.001) and hence volume, whereas Captopril increased compliance through an increase in volume distensibility (0.20 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.02% change volume/mm Hg; p less than 0.001) with minimal changes in arterial diameter. The study provided evidence that of the two vasodilating drugs, ISDN and Captopril, only Captopril caused a predominant pharmacological relaxing effect on the wall of hypertensive human brachial arteries studied in situ.", 
    "7": "Both the thiazide and loop diuretics have long been known to induce both potassium and magnesium wastage with resultant negative balances of these important intracellular cations. The negative potassium and magnesium balances resulting from diuretic therapy are due primarily to stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone complex or secondary hyperaldosteronism. A long experience with an attempt to modify or reduce diuretic-induced potassium depletion by dietary sodium restriction and by the use of antikaluretics has been recorded.", 
    "8": "The safety profiles of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, are the focus of this review. Adverse effects are reviewed as those associated with sulfhydryl compounds and as those considered class-specific adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Specifically discussed are the incidences of the adverse effects of rash, taste disturbance, neutropenia, and proteinuria, which are characteristic of compounds containing sulfhydryl moieties, such as captopril. It is concluded from the review of these safety data that enalapril is well tolerated, has few class-specific adverse effects, and may offer a potential advantage over captopril by having fewer sulfhydryl-related adverse effects.", 
    "9": "In this study, the use of enalapril and captopril is compared in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Although both drugs act on the renin-angiotensin system via converting enzyme inhibition, their different chemical structures may dispose them to different pharmacologic and physiologic activity. Both drugs exert a vasodilator effect, with reduction of left and right ventricular filling pressures and aortic impedance. In short-term hemodynamic studies, the onset of action and peak effect are earlier with captopril. Enalapril has a much more gradual onset and longer duration of action. Both drugs have a shallow dose-response curve and both produce comparable hormonal changes: an increase in plasma renin activity and a decrease in aldosterone levels. Captopril also increases prostaglandin production. Long-term efficacy trials have demonstrated symptomatic improvement in patients given captopril and those receiving enalapril who were also receiving digitalis and diuretics. Baseline hemodynamics may not predict long-term improvement. There are few adverse effects for the two drugs, but their incidences differ, suggesting a relationship to chemical structure. Recent studies in congestive heart failure suggest a reduction in mortality with various drug regimens.", 
    "10": "Oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was introduced eight years ago and is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. This treatment causes blood pressure lowering associated with suppression of angiotensin and aldosterone, lack of orthostatic hypotension or metabolic disturbances, redistribution of regional blood flows in favor of vital organs and, in the long term, decreased sympathetic drive and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. It is effective as monotherapy in more than 50 percent of unselected patients; addition of a diuretic increases the percentage of responders to more than 80 percent. It is the treatment of choice for patients with concurrent diabetes, asthma, gout, depression, or very active life-style. Side effects, observed originally in patients with severe hypertension and renal failure treated with very high doses of captopril, are rare in otherwise healthy hypertensive patients receiving smaller doses of this drug and virtually absent with second-generation angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors like enalapril.", 
    "11": "This review focuses on the renal effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril. Emphasis is placed on the renal response to these drugs in patients with primary essential hypertension, and in hypertension accompanying renal parenchymal disease. Specifically reviewed are the renal function and hemodynamic, salt and water, body fluid composition, and urinary protein excretion responses. The interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis has the potential to produce a variety of favorable renal responses, including reduction of renal vascular resistance, enhancement of renal blood flow, enhancement of glomerular filtration rate, acute natriuresis, sustained diuresis, and a decrease in urinary protein excretion. Data in support of these potential renal perturbations are presented and discussed. The results suggest that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are important therapeutic agents in the treatment of hypertensive disease, in that they may modify pathophysiologic renal abnormalities encountered in this disease state.", 
    "12": "Two angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are currently available for clinical use. Captopril, a sulfhydryl-containing compound, is a direct acting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril is a non-sulfhydryl pro-drug that requires enzymatic conversion to enalaprilic acid, a potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Both drugs lower blood pressure, suppress blood pressure response to angiotensin I infusion, and elevate plasma renin activity. Enalapril bioavailability is unaffected by food, whereas captopril availability is suppressed by food. Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with congestive heart failure and renal failure.", 
    "13": "To alter the natural history of congestive heart failure and change the poor prognosis for patients with this condition will require new insights into its pathogenesis as well as the development of strategies to alter the neurohumeral and serum electrolyte abnormalities associated with congestive heart failure, which are often exaggerated by current therapeutic approaches. Although improvement in hemodynamics and exercise tolerance in patients with congestive heart failure remains important, the emphasis of therapeutic goals should be shifted to prevent further cardiac deterioration and to prevent sudden cardiac death. The use of converting enzyme inhibitors holds promise for a beneficial effect on the altered hemodynamic, electrolyte, and neurohumeral abnormalities associated with congestive heart failure. If further prospective randomized trials confirm the beneficial effects of these agents in reducing the mortality rate among patients with congestive heart failure, it is likely that these benefits will have stemmed from their effects on neurohumeral factors and serum electrolyte abnormalities rather than from their effects on hemodynamics.", 
    "14": "Lowering the blood pressure to levels for which the arterial system has been designed should reduce various complications in the coronary and cerebral arteries, the heart, and the kidney. However, the antihypertensive treatment itself should not produce any significant damage. It is very likely that early modes of antihypertensive treatment did cause some biologic harm, which prevented the expected reduction in the incidence of coronary artery disease. However, the inability of these early forms of treatment to greatly improve coronary artery disease does not necessarily apply to treatments of the future.", 
    "15": "The membrane of mouse neuroblastoma N-18 cells degraded dynorphin-(1-13), dynorphin-(1-17), and Leu-enkephalin. The degradation of the former two peptides was inhibited strongly by N-ethylmaleimide, moderately by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate and phosphoramidon, and slightly by bestatin. When Leu-enkephalin was the substrate, however, the effects of phosphoramidon and bestatin were marked and those of N-ethylmaleimide and diisopropylphosphorofluoridate were negligibly small. Captopril did not affect the degradation of the two dynorphins and Leu-enkephalin, but inhibited the further cleavage of N-terminal fragments generated from dynorphin-(1-13) by the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive protease. Thus, a cysteine protease and, probably, a serine protease are responsible to the initial fragmentation of the dynorphins.", 
    "16": "Ten patients with moderate heart failure who still had symptoms despite 40 mg frusemide daily were treated with increased doses of frusemide and the addition of captopril in randomised order. Four different methods were used to assess the patients' response to treatment. Both treatments improved symptom-limited exercise tolerance, higher-dose frusemide having a more favourable effect. Perceived exertion during submaximal exercise was reduced by similar amounts by both treatments. The time taken to walk 100 m at a self-selected slow speed was reduced by both treatments; again higher-dose frusemide had a more beneficial effect. The higher dose of frusemide also had a more favourable effect on visual analogue scores for dyspnoea, fatigue, and general well-being.", 
    "17": "To evaluate the concept that long duration of action is an advantageous property of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of severe heart failure, we randomly assigned 42 patients to therapy with either a short-acting inhibitor (captopril, 150 mg daily) or a long-acting inhibitor (enalapril, 40 mg daily) for one to three months while concomitant therapy with digoxin and diuretics was kept constant. The treatment groups had similar hemodynamic and clinical characteristics at base-line evaluation and similar initial responses to converting-enzyme inhibition. During long-term therapy, captopril and enalapril produced similar decreases in systemic blood pressure, but the hypotensive effects of enalapril were more prolonged and persistent than those of captopril. Consequently, although the patients in both groups improved hemodynamically and clinically during the study, serious symptomatic hypotension (syncope and near syncope) was seen primarily among those treated with enalapril. Sustained hypotension also probably accounted for the decline in creatinine clearance (P less than 0.05) and the notable retention of potassium (P less than 0.05) observed in the patients treated with enalapril but not in those treated with captopril. We conclude that when large, fixed doses of converting-enzyme inhibitors are used in the treatment of patients with severe chronic heart failure, long-acting agents may produce prolonged hypotensive effects that may compromise cerebral and renal function, and thus they may have disadvantages in such cases, as compared with short-acting agents.", 
    "18": "The possible roles of vasodilatory prostanoids and the kallikrein-kinin system in the antihypertensive action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II) inhibitor captopril were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Captopril (20, 50 or 100 mg/kg daily orally) reduced blood pressure markedly and dose-dependently. It also increased water consumption and urine excretion, measured on the 5th day of treatment. The 24-hr urinary excretion of PGE2 was not changed, whereas that of PGF2 alpha and TxB2 tended to be enhanced. A clear increase, significant with all doses of captopril, occurred in the urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Kallikrein excretion in urine was suppressed by the two larger doses of captopril. The markedly augmented urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, the stable metabolite of vasodilatory prostacyclin (PGI2), suggests that increased prostacyclin production may participate in the antihypertensive mechanism of captopril. Vasodilatory kinins can also contribute, since the captopril-induced decrease in kallikrein may reflect accumulation of kinins due to their reduced metabolism.", 
    "19": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems in chronic heart failure causes important renal vasoconstriction. In a double-blind cross-over study, treatment with captopril for one month reduced systemic and renal vascular resistance by 14% and 25%, increased renal blood flow by 12%, and increased the percentage of the cardiac output perfusion to the kidney by 13%. Treatment with prazosin for one month also reduced systemic vascular resistance by 8%, renal vascular resistance increased by 20%, and renal blood flow and the percentage of the cardiac output going to the kidney fell by 14% and 26%. During captopril treatment, plasma aldosterone concentration was reduced to normal, but during prazosin treatment there was an initial increase in aldosterone of 45%, and a sustained increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration of 26%. Body weight decreased by 1.7 kg on captopril, but increased by 3.0 kg on prazosin, correlating inversely with the changes in renal blood flow. Sympathetic inhibition with prazosin causes systemic vasodilatation which diverts blood from the kidney and may result in fluid retention. Inhibition of the renin system with captopril causes preferential renal vasodilatation and can improve renal perfusion in chronic heart failure.", 
    "20": "There is much animal data to suggest that angiotensin II has a regulatory role in noradrenaline release. We sought evidence for such a mechanism in man by pretreating six normal volunteers with captopril (50 mg) or placebo and then infusing them with incremental doses of sodium nitroprusside. Pretreatment with captopril had no significant effect on the mean arterial pressure, heart rate or plasma noradrenaline response to sodium nitroprusside, despite increasing plasma renin activity. This suggests that in normotensive salt replete man, normal levels of angiotensin II do not exert any tonic effect on noradrenaline release.", 
    "21": "Isosmotic volume depletion was induced by subcutaneous injection of 5 ml of polyethylene glycol (PEG; 20 M; 30%) in Long-Evans rats and in rats deficient in hypothalamic vasopressin (Brattleboro rats). In the PEG-treated Long-Evans rats, captopril caused a hypotension that was greater than that seen in saline-injected controls. Pretreatment with the vasopressin (V1 receptor) antagonist d(CH2)5DAVP did not, itself, cause a fall in blood pressure, but it enhanced the hypotensive effect of captopril in the PEG-treated Long-Evans rats. The PEG-treated Brattleboro rats had similar resting blood pressures to the PEG-treated Long-Evans rats, but in the former group, captopril caused a more profound and progressive hypotension than was seen in any of the present experimental regimes used in the Long-Evans rats. This suggests that, during hypovolemia induced by PEG, Brattleboro rats were either more dependent on the renin-angiotensin system for the maintenance of arterial blood pressure than were Long-Evans rats treated acutely with a vasopressin (V1) receptor antagonist or less able to recruit sympathoadrenal mechanisms to compensate for the sudden loss of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "22": "Blockade of central but not peripheral mineralocorticoid receptors, with the antimineralocorticoid RU-28318, reduces but does not suppress salt appetite aroused by sodium depletion in the rat. When central mineralocorticoid blockade is combined with captopril treatment to prevent formation of endogenous angiotensin II the appetite is completely suppressed. Suppression of the appetite occurred without changes in the animals' spontaneous ingestive behaviors, sodium excretion, or insulin-induced food intake. These results demonstrate that a synergy of angiotensin II and aldosterone is responsible for the expression of depletion-induced salt appetite in the rat.", 
    "23": "The safety and efficacy of captopril in geriatric patients with mild to moderate hypertension was examined in an eight-week multicenter study of 99 patients. Following a placebo period, patients were treated with captopril 25 mg twice daily. Patients who were uncontrolled after two weeks of active therapy were randomized to either captopril 25 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 15 mg or captopril 50 mg twice daily. The average decrease in blood pressure at study completion was--16.9/11.9 mmHg. At the conclusion of the trial, 75.8% of patients responded to therapy. Captopril was well tolerated and believed to be a good therapeutic alternative for treating hypertension in the elderly population.", 
    "24": "A placebo-controlled single-blind study on acute effects of captopril on hypoxic pulmonary hypertension was performed in 15 patients with severe chronic obstructive lung disease recovering from right heart failure. Ten patients received active drug (25 mg captopril orally), five patients received placebo and served as control subjects. Before drug administration, there was no difference in lung function data and pulmonary hemodynamics between patients in both groups. Captopril produced highly significant fall in systemic arterial pressure. No change in breathing frequency, minute ventilation, and pulmonary gas exchange was observed. There was no significant change in studied variables after placebo. The presented data suggest that captopril does not decrease pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. A fall in pulmonary wedge pressure reflects a decrease in left ventricular afterload.", 
    "25": "Factors contributing to the maintenance of resting arterial blood pressure in sham-operated and adrenalectomized rats were assessed 14 weeks after operation; some animals were given 1% NaCl to drink throughout, and some animals were given sodium-free water instead of 1% NaCl for 2 days before the experiment. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin (ANG) system (with captopril) and of the cardiovascular actions of vasopressin [with 1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid),8-D-arginine vasopressin (d(CH2)5DAVP)] had no hypotensive effects in sham-operated rats under any conditions, but antagonism of nicotinic ganglionic transmission (with pentolinium) caused a prompt fall in blood pressure. During combined administration of captopril, d(CH2)5DAVP and pentolinium to sham-operated rats, there was no significant recovery of blood pressure. Adrenalectomized rats drinking 1% NaCl showed a marked hypotension and tachycardia in response to captopril, but d(CH2)5DAVP had little effect, whether administered before or after captopril. Addition of pentolinium rendered these animals more hypotensive than the sham-operated rats. Adrenalectomized rats drinking sodium-free water for 2 days were hypotensive and blood pressures were lowered further by d(CH2)5DAVP or captopril under these conditions; there was no accompanying tachycardia. The results indicate that, in chronically adrenalectomized rats drinking 1% NaCl, blood pressure is maintained by autonomic nervous and renin-ANG systems with no discernible contribution from the peripheral cardiovascular actions of vasopressin. However, the latter contribute importantly to the support of blood pressure when the adrenalectomized rats are rendered hypovolaemic and hypotensive by substitution of sodium-free water to drink.", 
    "26": "Our objectives were to investigate the extent to which angiotensin II (ANG II) and converting-enzyme inhibition (CEI) exert a direct vasoactive influence on the pulmonary circulation of conscious dogs. Multipoint pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were constructed during normoxia in conscious dogs by stepwise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to reduce Q. The effects of ANG II infusion (60 ng X kg-1 X min-1, iv) and CEI with captopril (1 mg/kg plus 1 mg X kg-1 X h-1, iv) on pulmonary vascular P/Q plots were assessed first with the conscious dogs intact and again after combined administration of pharmacological antagonists to block sympathetic alpha- and beta-adrenergic, cholinergic, and arginine vasopressin receptors. In intact dogs, ANG II increased (P less than 0.01) the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient (pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, PAP-PCWP) over the entire range of Q studied (60-120 ml X min-1 X kg-1). Conversely, CEI decreased (P less than 0.05) PAP-PCWP at each level of Q. After administration of the autonomic nervous system and arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, ANG II again increased (P less than 0.01) and CEI decreased (P less than 0.01) PAP-PCWP over the entire range of Q studied. Thus exogenous administration of ANG II results in active, nonflow-dependent constriction of the pulmonary circulation, and this effect is not dependent on the autonomic nervous system or increased circulating levels of arginine vasopressin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "In order to examine whether substrate specificity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) exists or not for N-terminal substituted angiotensin I (ANG I) in man, biological activities of sarcosine1-angiotensin I (Sar1-ANG I) and the effects of an ACE inhibitor, captopril, on the Sar1-ANG I activities were studied in 5 normal men. The following 3 experiments were done at 1 week intervals. Sarcosine1-angiotensin II (Sar1-ANG II) was infused iv at a rate of 5 pmol/kg X min from 0900 h to 0930 h in 5 normal men in a recumbent position. Blood pressure rose remarkably and the average increment was 38/31 mmHg at 30 min (p less than 0.001). Average duration of the pressor action after the cessation of the infusion (T) was 40 min for systolic and 50 min for diastolic and much longer than T of isoleucine5-angiotensin II. Plasma renin activity (PRA) decreased (p less than 0.01) and plasma aldosterone (PA) increased significantly (p less than 0.01). Sar1-ANG I was infused iv at a rate of 5 pmol/kg X min from 0900 h to 0930 h. Blood pressure rose to the same extent as in (1) (p less than 0.001). T was 40 min for both systolic and diastolic and much longer than T of ANG I in man. PRA decreased (p less than 0.01) and PA increased (p less than 0.01) significantly. Oral 100 mg captopril was given at 08:00 h and Sar1-ANG I was infused iv at a rate of 5 pmol/kg X min from 09:00 h to 09:30 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Preparations of the cranial segment of the rat inferior vena cava preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline were superfused in the presence of desipramine and corticosterone. Tritium overflow was stimulated electrically (2 Hz). The experiments were carried out in spirally cut strips with or without intima or in segments ligated at both ends and superfused either on the adventitial side (\"conventionally\") or \"inside out\". In spirally cut strips electrically evoked 3H overflow was increased by isoprenaline and procaterol, but much less so by prenalterol. Adrenaline 1 nmol/l increased overflow, but at high concentrations it reduced it, just as noradrenaline did at all concentrations. The concentration-response curve for isoprenaline was shifted to the right by propranolol (apparent pA2:8.29) and even more so by ICI 118-551, whereas atenolol was less potent (apparent pA2:6.42). Rauwolscine which, given alone, increased the evoked 3H overflow antagonized the inhibitory effect of noradrenaline (apparent pA2:7.58). These findings indicate that beta 2- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors mediating facilitation and inhibition of noradrenaline release, respectively, are present in the vena cava. The response to isoprenaline (at all concentrations) was considerably lower in segments superfused \"conventionally\" than in spirally cut strips, but no difference was observed with respect to the effects of noradrenaline, rauwolscine and angiotensin II. The effect of isoprenaline was clearly more pronounced in segments superfused \"inside out\" than in segments superfused \"conventionally\". In spirally cut strips angiotensin II increased 3H overflow. This effect was antagonized by saralasin, suggesting the involvement of facilitatory angiotensin receptors. In spirally cut strips or segments superfused \"inside out\", saralasin or captopril considerably attenuated the facilitatory effect of isoprenaline on 3H overflow. Conversely, in the presence of isoprenaline, captopril inhibited the electrically evoked 3H overflow in spirally cut strips, whereas in the absence of isoprenaline, captopril was ineffective. In conclusion, angiotensin receptors and alpha 2-adrenoceptors appear to be located on the sympathetic nerve endings, but a major part of the beta 2-adrenoceptors probably is subendothelial (most likely on smooth muscle cells). Angiotensin II, synthesized in response to beta 2-adrenoceptor activation, probably stimulates angiotensin receptors on the noradrenergic nerves, leading to an increase in noradrenaline release.", 
    "29": "Using an in vitro pressurized technique, we measured the myogenic pressure range and degree of myogenic activity in posterior cerebral arteries from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and rats of the same strain maintained by antihypertensive therapy. Treatment lowered the upper myogenic pressure limit and increased the strength of the myogenic response to levels comparable with those previously found in normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto, WKY) rats, suggesting that blood pressure history is the primary determinant of myogenic properties in the cerebral circulation.", 
    "30": "The interaction between converting enzyme inhibition and sympathetic system activity at systemic and regional (renal, mesenteric, hindlimb) levels was investigated in adult pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) using perindopril (5 mg/kg orally every day for 8 days) and the pulsed Doppler technique. Perindopril induced a decrease in systolic blood pressure and in regional vascular resistance which was abolished by binephrectomy. In addition, the drug had a sympathoinhibitory effect on the systemic vasopressor and the regional vasoconstrictor responses to cirazoline, especially UK 14304, an effect which was kidney-dependent (abolished by binephrectomy) and postjunctional, and spinal cord stimulation, an effect which was kidney-independent and most likely prejunctional in its mechanism.", 
    "31": "The active diacids of the new converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors ramipril and perindopril proved to possess a similar inhibitory potency against rat plasma CE in vitro. Both diacids were more active than enalaprilic acid or captopril. In stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) chronic oral treatment for 2 weeks with enalapril (30 mg/kg per day), ramipril or perindopril (each 1 mg/kg normalized blood pressure. The CE inhibitor-induced changes in parameters of the plasma renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin I (ANG I), angiotensin II (ANG II), PRC and CE activity] followed the expected pattern, but were not quantitatively related to the antihypertensive action of the three CE inhibitors. Four weeks of oral equi-dose treatment with the three CE inhibitors (10 mg/kg per day) inhibited tissue CE activity in various organs including kidney, heart, vascular wall and brain. Ramipril and perindopril lowered blood pressure and tissue CE activity more potently than enalapril did. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CE inhibition in tissue with subsequent local reduction of ANG II synthesis may contribute to the antihypertensive mechanisms of CE inhibitors.", 
    "32": "Following intravenous infusion, angiotensin I (ANG I), angiotensin II (ANG II), and angiotensin III (ANG III) enhance Na and water absorption across the jejunum by increasing sympathetic nerve activity. Increased absorption following intravenous infusion of angiotensin peptides may be secondary to an increase in ion transport. To test this hypothesis, the effect of angiotensin peptides on ion and water absorption from the isolated jejunum was studied. At a dose of 100 pM, serosal addition of ANG II stimulated jejunal Na and water absorption. In contrast, mucosal additions of the peptide were ineffective at doses up to 1 microM. ANG II enhanced jejunal absorption in the presence of prazosin. Thus ANG II does not appear to stimulate absorption from the isolated intestine through mediation of sympathetic fibers. ANG III and the substituted analogue [Sar1,Leu8]ANG II stimulated jejunal absorption at a dose of 100 pM. At a dose of 1 nM ANG I also stimulated jejunal absorption. The effect of ANG I on absorption could be prevented by prior treatment of the animals with the converting enzyme inhibitor MK 422. Thus ANG I must first be converted to ANG II to stimulate jejunal absorption.", 
    "33": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme, although most prominent in vascular endothelium, has been identified in numerous tissues. Recent studies have indicated that several hormones, including glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone, may affect the activity of this enzyme. In the present study, angiotensin-converting enzyme was examined in homogenates of cultured human skin fibroblasts. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was measured by a radiometric assay using [Glycine-1-14C] Hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (1.1 mmol/L) as substrate, and was expressed as nmol hippuric acid formed per minute/mg protein. Angiotensin-converting enzyme was identified in all five cell strains tested, and the activity observed was 0.97 +/- 0.18 nmol/min/mg protein (mean +/- SE). The optimum pH was between 6.9 and 7.6, and optimum temperature was 37 degrees C, with loss of activity of 55 degrees C and higher. Buffer strength was optimized at Tris 0.025 mol/L, and 1.0 mol/L NaCl. Activity increased linearly with protein concentration and with time, and the Km = 1.14 mmol/L. The most potent inhibitor of fibroblast ACE was captopril (SQ 14,225) with an IC50 = 10(-10) mol/L; other inhibitors included SQ 20,881, EDTA, and phenanthroline. Competitive substrates included angiotensin-I, substance P, and bradykinin. Four hormones, T3 (10(-9)-10(-7) mol/L), 1,25 (OH)2D3 (10(-8)-10(-7) mol/L), dexamethasone (10(-7)-10(-6) mol/L), and a synthetic androgen, R1881 (10(-8)-10(-7) mol/L) were incubated with cells for 72 hours. In all incubations, there was no significant effect on cellular ACE activity induced by any agent. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in serum free media was less than 1% of cell activity and was unaltered by hormone treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "The synthesis and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting activities of quinapril (CI-906, 22), its active diacid (CI-928, 33), and its dimethoxy analogue (CI-925, 25) are reported. These tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid derivatives possess equivalent in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy to enalapril. Sulfhydryl analogues with the same structural variation are also highly potent. In contrast, tetrahydro-1-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid and homologous isoindoline-1-carboxylic acid analogues show a striking divergence in potency between the two types, sulfhydryl analogues being essentially inactive, while non-sulfhydryl analogues are equipotent with the proline prototype. This is the first evidence suggesting that alternate binding modes may exist for the two major structural classes of small molecule ACE inhibitors.", 
    "35": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not caffeine would exacerbate renovascular hypertension. Therefore, we examined the effects of chronic caffeine administration on arterial blood pressure in rats subjected to either unilateral renal artery clipping (2K-1C rats) or sham-operation. Animals in each group were randomly assigned to receive either 0.1% caffeine in their drinking water or normal drinking water, and systolic blood pressure was monitored for 6 wk. Caffeine markedly exacerbated the severity of hypertension in 2K-1C rats and caused histological changes consistent with malignant hypertension. 6 wk after surgery, systolic blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and creatinine clearance in control 2K-1C rats were 169 +/- 5 mmHg (mean +/- SEM), 4.4 +/- 0.5 ng AI X ml-1 X h-1, and 2.9 +/- 0.2 ml/min, respectively; as compared with 219 +/- 4 mmHg, 31.8 +/- 7.8 ng AI X ml-1 X h-1, and 1.4 +/- 0.3 ml/min, respectively, in 2K-1C rats receiving caffeine (all values were significantly different compared with control 2K-1C). Chronic caffeine administration did not alter systolic blood pressure, plasma renin activity, or creatinine clearance in sham-operated rats or spontaneously hypertensive rats. Chronic treatment with enalapril (a converting enzyme inhibitor) prevented the development of hypertension in control 2K-1C rats and caffeine-treated 2K-1C rats; however, withdrawal of enalapril precipitated a rapid rise in systolic blood pressure in caffeine-treated 2K-1C rats, but not in control 2K-1C rats. These experiments indicate that caffeine specifically exacerbates experimental renovascular hypertension and might worsen the hypertensive process in patients with renovascular hypertension.", 
    "36": "When renal perfusion pressure is reduced in experimentally induced low-output states, glomerular filtration rate is preserved by angiotensin II-mediated efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, but available evidence in man suggests that angiotensin II supports renal function only to the extent that it preserves systemic blood pressure. We performed simultaneous assessments of cardiac and renal function in 56 patients with severe chronic heart failure before and after 1 to 3 months of converting-enzyme inhibition. Among the 29 patients with a pretreatment renal perfusion pressure under 70 mm Hg, patients with preserved renal function (creatinine clearance greater than 50 ml/min/1.73 m2) had markedly elevated values for plasma renin activity (11.8 +/- 3.8 ng/ml/hr) and showed a significant decline in creatinine clearance after converting-enzyme inhibition (61.1 +/- 3.0 to 45.9 +/- 5.3 ml/min/1.73 m2; p less than .05). In contrast, although similar with respect to all pretreatment demographic, hemodynamic, and clinical variables, patients with a creatinine clearance under 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 had low values for plasma renin activity (3.4 +/- 0.8 ng/ml/hr) and, despite similar drug-induced decreases in systemic blood pressure, showed no change in creatinine clearance after therapy with captopril or enalapril (32.6 +/- 2.5 to 41.4 +/- 3.8 ml/min/1.73 m2). Changes in creatinine clearance varied linearly and inversely with pretreatment values for plasma renin activity (r = - .64, p less than .001); converting-enzyme inhibition effectively abolished the pretreatment difference in renal function seen in the high- and low-renin subgroups. In the 27 patients with a renal perfusion pressure of 70 mm Hg or greater, creatinine clearance did not vary significantly with plasma renin activity and was not altered by therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "The heptapeptide Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 (YGGFMRF) is cleaved at a high rate by tissue peptidases including dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. The inhibitor, Hoe 498 diacid (2-[N-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-(1S,3S,5S)-2-azabicyclo- [3.3.0] octane-3-carboxylic acid), was found to be highly effective in blocking YGGFMRF degradation by a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase present in a preparation of mouse striatal microsomes. The recovery of YGGFMRF released from rat striatal slices was increased in the presence of Hoe 498 diacid. Furthermore, the recovery of YGGFMRF injected into the caudate was increased in rats pretreated i.p. with Hoe 498 diacid. After i.v. or i.p. injections both Hoe 498 diacid and its prodrug Hoe 498 monoester (2-[N-[(S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-(1S,3S,5S)-2- azabicyclo [3.3.0] octane-3-carboxylic acid) were detected in rat cerebrospinal fluid and the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity in cerebrospinal fluid was inhibited. These observations indicate that endogenously released YGGFMRF is protected from degradation by Hoe 498 diacid and that systemically administered Hoe 498 diacid or monoester penetrate the blood-brain barrier and inhibit brain and cerebrospinal fluid dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity. This potent inhibitor may be useful to block YGGFMRF inactivation in studies of the pharmacology and physiology of YGGFMRF. It is also possible that some of the cerebral effects of these compounds may be referable to an enhancement of YGGFMRF action in the central nervous system.", 
    "38": "To evaluate the role of dietary sodium and antihypertensive drugs in the modulation of myocardial structure, especially myosin isozymic pattern, renal hypertensive rats (two-kidney, one clip) were treated with a sodium-deficient diet (7 mEq/kg), captopril, or atenolol. Native myosin was extracted under nondissociating conditions and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The percentage of myosin isozyme V1 was significantly decreased from 71.5 +/- 7.5 (Wistar controls) to 52.4 +/- 1.7% (p less than 0.05) in renal hypertensive rats and was associated with an increase in V3 component from 12.7 +/- 5.1 (Wistar controls) to 23.1 +/- 1.4% (renal hypertensive rats; p less than 0.05). There was a dramatic change in the myosin isozyme distribution pattern after treatment with low sodium and captopril. Six weeks of low sodium therapy in renal hypertensive rats resulted in an increase in V1 from 52.4 +/- 1.7 to 74.8 +/- 4.8% and a reduction in V3 from 23.1 +/- 1.4 to 9.5 +/- 2.4%. Normal rats treated with low sodium showed similar results. The percentage distribution of isozymes after low sodium therapy in the captopril-treated rats was not different from that in normal Wistar controls. Captopril therapy also caused an increase in V1 and a decrease in V3. Atenolol therapy, on the other hand, caused a significant increase in V3 and decrease in V1 with no change in blood pressure or heart weight. These data suggest that dietary sodium may play an important role in the modulation of myocardial mass and may modulate signals for synthesis of V1 or V3 myosin phenotypes.", 
    "39": "L-Sparteine sulfate (sparteine, 3 mg/kg) was injected intravenously over 3 min in 12 anaesthetized dogs in order to evaluate the inotropic effect of this antiarrhythmic drug on the heart in intact organisms. There was a discrete decline in left ventricular dP/dtmax which was transient within 9 min. No influence could be detected on right ventricular pressure rise velocity. Aortic pressure increased by about 15% and a parallel increase in left ventricular enddiastolic pressure was observed. Heart rate was slightly diminished. Pharmacological blockade of cardiac autonomic nerves did not influence considerably the effect of sparteine. Pretreatment with captopril and phentolamine did not abolish the vasoconstrictive property which was also present in a reserpine pretreated dog. Sparteine shows no pronounced inotropic effect in the heart in situ. It increases arterial blood pressure by direct vascular constriction.", 
    "40": "This review examines the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on blood lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. A large number of studies have documented the elevation of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol with many thiazide-type diuretic drugs, albeit mainly in short term studies. When added to thiazide diuretics, both beta 1-selective and non-selective beta-blocking drugs elevate total triglycerides and VLDL triglycerides, lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and raise the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio. Most non-selective beta-blockers have similar effects when used as monotherapy, but the beta 1-selective agents appear not to affect HDL cholesterol in monotherapy. Prazosin appears free of adverse lipid effects and has improved lipid-lipoprotein concentrations in many studies. Preliminary data on several other drugs also suggest a favourable lipid profile and additional study is warranted - among these are guanabenz, clonidine, pindolol, labetalol, indapamide, and guanfacine. Elevations in serum triglycerides are often ignored on various counts, but triglycerides have been found to be a strong risk factor in European studies and in women over the age of 50 years in the Framingham study. Despite the unfavourable short term effects of diuretics, the theoretical risk of the lipid-lipoprotein changes remains unclear because HDL cholesterol and the total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio are often unchanged. For this and other reasons, a long term trial comparing thiazide-type diuretics with drugs with the most favourable lipid-lipoprotein profile is needed. Until this is accomplished, in most settings diuretic-based regimens are still preferred initially since they are of proven, if limited, efficacy against the cardiovascular complications of hypertension.", 
    "41": "The renin-angiotensin system is known to respond to various stimuli with a marked increase in its activity. This phenomenon is well known in relationship to changes in sodium balance. Thus, the antihypertensive effect of diuretics is often blunted or even abolished by an excessive renin response. Water deprivation and alpha-adrenoceptor blockade also elicit considerable renin responses, which as a result become a predominant factor in blood pressure maintenance. Accordingly, the renin system plays a very important role in blood pressure regulation not just because it is spontaneously activated under steady-state conditions, but even more because of its responsiveness to pharmacological and other stimuli. This may explain the surprising efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which block the generation of angiotensin II, and thereby all vascular effects of spontaneously elevated renin levels as well as of any renin response.", 
    "42": "While no consensus over the treatment of essential hypertension has been reached, three recent major trials offer guidance to the clinician. The results of these trials and the role of new and old drugs in the treatment of hypertension are discussed.", 
    "43": "This is the era of polypharmacy. Treatment with multiple therapeutic agents for multiple underlying medical conditions leads to greater vulnerability to such metabolic imbalances as hyperkalemia. The physician must know which underlying medical conditions and drugs predispose to abnormal intracellular-extracellular potassium balance and abnormal regulation of potassium excretion.", 
    "44": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibition by captopril and enalapril may influence sodium and potassium homeostasis. In patients without cardiac failure and with normal renal function significant electrolyte disturbances rarely occur. We report on four patients who developed life-threatening electrolyte disturbances following treatment with enalapril for severe cardiac failure (NYHA-class II-IV). There were important concomitant factors in all four cases: in one case under additional medication with a thiazide diuretic and a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory, hyponatremia of 107 mmol/l occurred. In two further cases severe hyperkalemia of 7.4 and 7.3 mmol/l was observed in the presence of acute renal failure due to enalapril-induced hypotension and concomitant therapy with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug respectively. In a fourth case the combination of enalapril with a potassium-sparing diuretic provoked severe hyperkalemia of 7.9 mmol/l.", 
    "45": "Human angiotensin-converting enzyme has been purified, in a single chromatographic step, using a novel N-carboxyalkyl dipeptide CA-GlyGly (N-[1(S)-carboxy-5-aminopentyl]glycylglycine) synthesised in our laboratory. CA-GlyGly is a weak competitive inhibitor, Ki = 0.18 mM, and its inhibitory profile is markedly pH-dependent. Human lung and kidney angiotensin-converting enzyme were solubilised with Triton X-100 and after ammonium sulphate fractionation the crude extract was applied to a column containing CA-GlyGly coupled to agarose via a 2.8 nm spacer group. Electrophoretically pure human angiotensin-converting enzyme could be eluted by raising the pH of the chromatography buffer from 7.50 to 9.50. The specific activity of human angiotensin-converting enzyme purified from lung was 104 units/mg, while that from kidney was 88 units/mg. Molecular weight for both enzymes was estimated to be 160,000. The Km with respect to hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine was 1.9 mM in the case of lung angiotensin-converting enzyme and 1.7 mM in that of kidney angiotensin-converting enzyme, while for the substrate angiotensin I Km values were 62 microM and 76 microM, respectively. Hydrolysis of either substrate was chloride-dependent and both enzymes were strongly inhibited by captopril.", 
    "46": "Mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension affects almost 15 p. 100 of middle-aged adults in the general population. Although its individual vascular complications are few, it constitutes a problem of public health since a large number of patients implies a large number of complications in the population. Hypotensive therapy has proved capable of preventing mechanical complications of vascular rupture, but epidemiological studies have not yet demonstrated that it reduces the frequency of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and, probably, of other arteries at risk. A more detailed physiopathological approach to the vascular system in hypertensive patients therefore is necessary, notably to investigate the interactions between arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis and antihypertensive drugs. Meanwhile, the therapeutic strategy remains empirical, its principal goal being the degree of fall in blood pressure. The large number of drugs currently prescribed as first-choice treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) has complicated the conventional treatment by successive prescription of drugs with additive effects and has paved the way for a new therapeutic approach involving substitution and trying to find, for each individual patient, one or two effective drugs.", 
    "47": "The enkephalin-inactivating enzymes in rat vas deferens were studied by using the relatively specific inhibitor of each enzyme. The results showed that the rat vas deferens, like the other three preparations, guinea-pig ileum, mouse vas deferens and striatal membranes of guinea-pig brain, which had been investigated previously, contained three distinct enkephalin-hydrolyzing peptidases. Additionally, the enkephalin-hydrolyzing aminopeptidase, endopeptidase-24.11 and peptidyl dipeptidase A in rat vas deferens were found to be inhibited maximally with 1 microM of amastatin, 1 microM of phosphoramidon and 1 microM of captopril, respectively. In contrast to these three enzymes, both L-tyrosyl-L-tyrosine-sensitive dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and D-phenylalanine-sensitive carboxypeptidase were suggested not to be involved significantly in the inactivation of exogenously given enkephalin in rat vas deferens. The characteristics of the enkephalin-degradative enzymes in rat vas deferens were discussed in terms of their similarities to and differences from those in the other preparations.", 
    "48": "Hypertension was produced in 20 female rats by the oral administration of mestranol for 6 months; 20 control rats were not given mestranol during this time. The i.v. infusion of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, into 10 conscious mestranol-treated rats reduced mean arterial pressure from 139 +/- 2 (SEM) to 130 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01); mean arterial pressure in 10 conscious control rats averaged 123 +/- 3 mm Hg, and was not significantly changed during captopril infusion. Injections of bradykinin at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 microgram/100 gm body weight decreased mean arterial pressure significantly more in 10 mestranol-treated rats than in 10 control rats. These results suggest that the ability of captopril to lower arterial pressure in rats with mestranol-induced hypertension may be due, at least in part, to the action of captopril to enhance bradykinin.", 
    "49": "A 49-year-old man with severe hypertension and chronic schizophrenia developed marked hypotension with postural syncope following therapy with the combination of chlorpromazine and captopril. Previously, the patient's blood pressure (BP) had been poorly controlled on a regimen of chlorpromazine and hydrochlorothiazide, nadolol, and prazosin. The supine and standing BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP were subsequently studied while the patient was maintained on chlorpromazine and captopril, chlorpromazine alone, and on no therapy. Chlorpromazine alone caused a moderate reduction in supine and standing BP with a reversal of the circadian BP profile. The combination of chlorpromazine and small doses of captopril (12.5 mg/d) induced a reduction in supine BP of 84/32 mm Hg compared with chlorpromazine alone and exaggerated the postural hypotension. Hormonal investigation demonstrated low baseline renin activity that increased during therapy with captopril and a physiologic catecholamine response to change in posture. These data demonstrate that there is a synergism between captopril and chlorpromazine that may result in marked, symptomatic hypotension that is probably unrelated to the baseline level of plasma renin activity or catecholamines.", 
    "50": "In a 56-year-old man with severe familial hypertension and unilateral renal artery stenosis, captopril induced striking changes in the renograms of the affected kidney. After injection of orthoiodohippurate sodium I 131, the uptake phase was unchanged but the later curve showed continuous accumulation. In contrast, the uptake of technetium Tc 99m diethylenetriamine pentracetic acid was abolished. These changes are compatible with a cessation of filtration and maintenance of renal blood flow. After balloon dilatation of the stenosis, the blood pressure became lower, and these changes could no longer be demonstrated. The captopril renogram may provide useful information on the dependency of hypertension on unilateral renal artery stenosis.", 
    "51": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) derived from rat lung, aorta, epididymus, brain, kidney and plasma was characterized by radio-inhibitor (125I-MK351A) binding studies. Under optimal binding conditions at equilibrium 125I-MK351A bound to ACE was displaced from ACE in a concentration related manner by unlabelled MK351A. MK351A binding site concentration for each tissue and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was estimated by Scatchard analysis of binding data. Binding sites/mg protein was greatest in lung and least in brain. The KD for kidney ACE was significantly higher than that of lung, aorta, epididymus or brain ACE (P less than 0.005; t-test, d.f. = 10). 125I-MK351A bound to ACE prepared from lung and kidney was displaced in a concentration dependent manner by SQ20881, SQ14225, MK422, and Ro31-3113-000. Concentration of ACE inhibitor required to displace 50% of bound 125I-MK351A (DD50) was consistently higher for kidney-derived ACE than lung-derived ACE. The differences in radio-inhibitor binding characteristics of ACE from different rat tissues suggests that the enzyme active site may not be identical in all organs.", 
    "52": "This study evaluates the antihypertensive effects of enalapril, a new, potent, long acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. 69 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were included in 5 groups. Group I was used to compare the effects of enalapril and propranolol on blood pressure, renal function, plasma renin activity, aldosterone excretion and plasma lipids in 24 patients after 12 weeks. Group II was used to evaluate long term effects (48 weeks) of these drugs in 13 patients. Group III included 32 patients that received enalapril as monotherapy for 6 to 12 weeks. Group IV was studied to estimate the antihypertensive effect of low doses of hydrochlorothiazide in 18 patients receiving enalapril. Group V was used to compare the antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril or enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide in 19 patients. The effect on mean blood pressure was similar with enalapril and propranolol (117 versus 103 mmHg and 115 versus 104 mmHg respectively); however, glomerular filtration rate decreased with propranolol (105 versus 87 ml/min; p less than .05) and was unaltered with enalapril (102 versus 98 ml/min). Triglycerides rose with propranolol (179 versus 231 mg/dl; p less than .05) and did not change with enalapril (157 versus 121 mg/dl). In the long term, antihypertensive effects were similar and no significant side effects were observed. In 14/32 patients blood pressure became normal with enalapril alone. Low doses of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg) decreased mean blood pressure by 10 mmHg when added to enalapril. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide was significant greater than that of enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide alone. Used as monotherapy, enalapril normalised blood pressure in 44% of cases. Addition of low doses of hydrochlorothiazide significantly increased the antihypertensive effect of enalapril. These results show that enalapril is a good antihypertensive agent alone or with low doses of diuretic.", 
    "53": "N-[N-[(S)-1-Ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-N-(indan-2- yl)glycine hydrochloride (CV-3317) and its de-esterified products, CV-3317-COOH and CV-3317-(5-OH)-COOH, inhibited rabbit lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with the IC50s of 1.2 X 10(-7), 4.0 X 10(-8) and 4.9 X 10(-8) M, respectively, angiotensin I (A-I)-induced vasoconstriction of the rat aorta (IC50: 2.6 X 10(-7), 2.6 X 10(-8) and 5.4 X 10(-8) M, respectively), and A-I-induced pressor response of the rat kidney (IC50: 3.9 X 10(-7), 3.5 X 10(-8) and 2.8 X 10(-8) M, respectively). In these 3 experiments, both de-esterified products were 4 to 14 times more potent than captopril. In rats, CV-3317 (0.0138 to 138 mumol/kg, p.o.) inhibited plasma and lung ACEs, and the effects at a dose of 0.46 mumol/kg lasted more than 8 hr. CV-3317 inhibited the A-I-induced pressor action in rats (0.138 to 13.8 mumol/kg, p.o. or 0.046 to 0.138 mumol/kg i.v.) and dogs (0.46 to 4.6 mumol/kg, p.o.) in a dose-related manner. CV-3317 was more potent and longer acting than captopril in these in vivo ACE inhibitions. CV-3317 augmented bradykinin-induced hypotension (dogs) and contraction of the ileum (guinea pigs) less potently than captopril. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), CV-3317 (3 mg/kg, p.o.) markedly inhibited plasma and tissue (aorta, kidney, lung and brain) ACEs; and when administered daily for 2 weeks, it inhibited the plasma, aorta, kidney and lung ACEs; in particular, it markedly inhibited the aortic ACE. Captopril (30 mg/kg, p.o.) markedly inhibited tissue ACEs and slightly plasma ACE, but its inhibitory effects on tissue ACEs, except for the aorta, were unclear by repeated dosings and its effect on plasma ACE was rather enhanced. Thus, the inhibition of vascular ACE may be particularly important for the antihypertensive effect of the ACE inhibitors, including CV-3317, in SHR.", 
    "54": "The antihypertensive action of N-[N-[(S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenyl-propyl]-L-alanyl]-N-(indan-2-yl) glycine hydrochloride (CV-3317), a nonsulfhydryl compound characterized as an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in our previous work, was examined in hypertensive animal models. In 2-kidney, 1 clip hypertensive rats and dogs, CV-3317 (3 and/or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a sustained antihypertensive action of about 15 to 25 mmHg. Daily oral administrations of CV-3317 (1 to 10 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) for 5 weeks produced a sustained antihypertensive action of 20 to 40 mmHg. When CV-3317 (3 mg/kg) was combined with hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg), its antihypertensive action was intensified in potency and duration. CV-3317 (30 mg/kg) induced a slight hypotension (5 to 10 mmHg) in normotensive rats, but had no effect on the blood pressure of 1-kidney, 1 clip hypertensive rats and on that of a low renin type of DOCA/salt hypertensive rat. The antihypertensive activity of CV-3317 was more potent than that of captopril. In pithed SHR, the pressor response induced by an electrical stimulation of the preganglionic sympathetic nerve, but not the pressor response to norepinephrine, was attenuated by both agents (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.). Both agents may exert their antihypertensive action not only primarily by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, but also by inhibiting norepinephrine release from the sympathetic nerve terminals indirectly by reducing the formation of vascular angiotensin II.", 
    "55": "In this investigation we studied the inhibitory effect of FOY S 983 (gabexate mesilate) and FOY S 980 (camostate mesilate) on the kininase II activity in human plasma in vitro. Both compounds were able to inhibit kinase II, however, compared to captopril or EDTA only very weakly. The inhibitory effect of FOY S 983 or FOY S 980 could be diminished neither by NaOH-induced hydrolysis of the inhibitor nor by dialysis or ultrafiltration, but could be clearly reduced by dialysis against ZnCl2 solution. The inhibition of kininase II activity in human plasma by FOY S 983 was due to its 6-guanidinocaproate component probably acting as Zn2+-complexing agent. The ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate component of FOY S 983 had no inhibitory effect.", 
    "56": "Thirteen subjects with essential hypertension controlled on oral enalapril (20 mg/day) therapy were entered into a protocol to assess serially 24-hour blood pressure, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, and plasma and urine enalaprilat drug levels, following both chronic oral administration of enalapril and its replacement with intravenous enalaprilat. Results indicate that systolic and diastolic blood pressures remain well controlled following cessation of oral enalapril and replacement with intravenous enalaprilat. Enalaprilat drug levels, following oral enalapril and intravenous enalaprilat, remained above the therapeutic levels required for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. However, therapeutic enalaprilat levels can probably be achieved with one fourth of the total cumulative dose of enalapril, administered as enalaprilat at 6-hour intervals. Intravenous enalaprilat stimulated plasma renin activity and decreased immunoreactive plasma angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone concentrations. However, immunoreactive plasma angiotensin II concentrations were not suppressed below pretreatment values, suggesting that chronic enalapril/acute enalaprilat therapy controls blood pressure through a nonangiotensin-mediated antihypertension mechanism.", 
    "57": "The effect of acute administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow was assessed in 16 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Following administration of captopril, mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell in all cases, whereas effective renal plasma flow increased from 27% to 88% in 10 patients, remained unchanged in 4, and decreased by 60% and 93% in 2 patients in whom MAP fell to 54 and 47 mmHg, respectively. Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate values achieved after captopril were both positively correlated with postcaptopril MAP. The results of this study suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in the regulation of MAP and the renal vasoconstriction associated with severe congestive heart failure. However, angiotensin blockade may induce a deterioration in renal function in patients in whom arterial pressure falls to markedly low values, thus suggesting an influence in angiotensin in renal autoregulation in these patients.", 
    "58": "Different oral doses (5, 20, 50 mg) of the new orally active nonsulfhydryl-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril (HOE498), were given to 12 normotensive healthy males, and the pattern of changes in plasma active and inactive renin concentration was evaluated. Active and inactive renin increased after ramipril, and the magnitude of the response was clearly dose related. Active renin rose markedly by 4 hours and tended to decrease thereafter, although remaining higher than basal at 24 hours. In contrast, inactive renin rose more slowly, and the increase was sustained throughout the 24-hour period. The pattern of these changes is consistent with the hypothesis that circulating inactive renin is a biosynthetic precursor of the active form.", 
    "59": "Possible non-renin antihypertensive actions of two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the sulfhydryl compound captopril and the new nonsulfhydryl inhibitor quinapril (CI-906), were compared in rats with one-kidney deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension. Plasma renin activity remained low during the 12-day treatments and showed very strong suppression of the renin-angiotensin system. Quinapril did not influence the rapidly increasing blood pressure. Although captopril tended to reduce the development of hypertension (p = 0.08), it did not have any significant effect, either. The results indicate that these ACE inhibitors with different chemical structures lack any significant blood pressure lowering mechanism in severe deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension, a model in which they cannot act through their established antihypertensive mechanism, the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "60": "The age-related changes in the renin-angiotensin system were investigated in normotensive 3-, 10-, 20-, and 30-mo-old female Wistar rats. Plasma renin concentration and immunofluorescent renal renin index remained constant from 3 to 10 mo, then decreased as the animals become older, whereas plasma concentration of renin substrate diminished slightly between 10 and 20 mo and plasma converting-enzyme activity was not modified with age. Acute inhibition of converting-enzyme activity by intravenous administration of 0.1 mg/100 g body wt S 9780 (the diacid form of S 9490) was followed by a 7- to 8-mmHg decrease in arterial pressure and a concomitant 10-12% increase in inulin and p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance in the 10- and 20-mo-old rats. On the other hand, neither glomerular filtration rate, PAH clearance nor arterial blood pressure were affected by converting-enzyme inhibition in the 30 mo-old rats. These results indicate that the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is progressively reduced with age and suggest that angiotensin II does not play an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure and kidney hemodynamics in normotensive female senescent rats.", 
    "61": "Initial studies determined whether a renal factor facilitates decreased jejunal absorption following volume expansion of the anesthetized rat. Volume expansion (VE) decreased jejunal absorption to the same extent in both normal and nephrectomized animals. Furthermore, VE of a donor animal failed to alter jejunal absorption in a recipient following cross circulation. Thus, a hormonal factor is not implicated in the jejunal response to VE. Additional experiments demonstrated that rats ingesting a high-Na diet exhibited levels of jejunal absorption lower than animals fed a normal-Na diet. High-Na animals were not volume expanded. Plasma aldosterone concentrations and plasma renin activity were reduced in high-Na animals. Bilateral adrenalectomy-nephrectomy inhibited jejunal absorption. However, neither bilateral adrenalectomy nor bilateral nephrectomy alone inhibited jejunal absorption. Furthermore, inhibition of angiotensin formation in adrenalectomized animals failed to alter jejunal absorption. Decreased jejunal absorption in high-Na animals is not due to volume expansion or to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.", 
    "62": "Renal blood flow was serially measured as the left renal vein blood flow using the continuous thermodilution technique during acute angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in 20 patients with stable congestive heart failure. Eleven patients received captopril orally, and the remaining nine patients received enalaprilat intravenously. During the control period, left renal vein blood flow and cardiac output did not correlate closely (r = 0.57). Following administration of captopril or enalaprilat, stroke volume index increased from 20 +/- 7 to 25 +/- 8 ml/M2 (p less than 0.001), while pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 26 +/- 8 to 19 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Left renal vein blood flow increased in all patients despite a consistent reduction in systemic arterial pressure. At peak effect, left renal vein blood flow increased from 295 +/- 86 to 443 +/- 122 ml/min (p less than 0.001), while mean systemic arterial pressure fell from 81 +/- 13 to 71 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Thus, in patients with stable congestive heart failure, acute angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, although decreasing substantially systemic arterial pressure, consistently enhances renal blood flow.", 
    "63": "The pulmonary circulation was previously shown to inactivate and even activate a number of autacoids. Further studies showed that these enzymatic activities were localized in vascular endothelial cells. The present results shows that guinea pig free airway cells (FACs) convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II and inactivate bradykinin, whereas they do not inactivate serotonin, prostaglandin E2, histamine, and noradrenaline. In the presence of a converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ14225), the angiotensin I was not converted into angiotensin II, but bradykinin was still inactivated, although the speed of inactivation was decreased. Furthermore, when FACs were separated as adherent and nonadherent cells, the cleavage of angiotensin I by adherent cells was similar to that of the total cell suspension. The inactivation of bradykinin was more pronounced in incubation with nonadherent than with the adherent cells. Using selected enzyme inhibitors, we also showed that the conversion of angiotensin by FAC is the result of specific kinase II activity most likely located in macrophages, whereas the bradykinin inactivation is the result of the cooperation of many enzymes including kinase I and II produced by various cell types.", 
    "64": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was localized in sarcoid lymph nodes by an in vitro autoradiographic technique using a synthetic ACE inhibitor of high affinity, 125I-labelled 351A. The lymph nodes were from seven patients with active sarcoidosis who underwent mediastinoscopy and from six control subjects who had nodes resected at either mediastinoscopy or laparotomy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme was localized in the epithelioid cells of sarcoid granulomata in markedly increased amounts compared with control nodes, where it was restricted to vessels and some histiocytes. In sarcoid lymph nodes, there was little ACE present in lymphocytes or fibrous tissue. Sarcoid nodes with considerable fibrosis had much less intense ACE activity than the nonfibrotic nodes. The specific activity of ACE measured by an enzymatic assay in both the control and sarcoid lymph nodes closely reflected the ACE activity demonstrated by autoradiography. Sarcoid lymph nodes with fibrosis had an ACE specific activity of half that of nonfibrotic nodes (p less than 0.05). There was a 15-fold increase in specific ACE activity in sarcoid nodes (p less than 0.05) compared to normal. Serum ACE was significantly higher in those sarcoid patients whose lymph nodes were not fibrosed compared with those with fibrosis (p less than 0.01). This technique offers many advantages over the use of polyclonal antibodies. The 351A is a highly specific ACE inhibitor, chemically defined and in limitless supply. This method enables the quantitation of results, and autoradiographs may be stored indefinitely for later comparison.", 
    "65": "Pulmonary injury induced by the plant alkaloid monocrotaline is partially prevented by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. CL242817 [(S-[R*,S*])-1-([3-acetylthio]-3-benzoyl-2-methyl-propionyl)- L-proline] is a new orally active ACE inhibitor under evaluation as an antihypertensive agent. To determine whether CL242817 also can modify monocrotaline-induced pulmonary injury, male rats were divided into four groups: control; CL242817 (60 mg/kg/day, po); monocrotaline (2.4 mg/kg/day, po); or monocrotaline plus CL242817, and were sacrificed after 6 weeks of continuous treatment. Rats receiving monocrotaline alone exhibited occlusive medial thickening of the pulmonary arteries, cardiomegaly, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Electron micrographs of monocrotaline-treated lung revealed degeneration of both endothelial and Type I epithelial cells, as well as marked interstitial hypercellularity and fibrosis. Hydroxyproline (collagen) content of monocrotaline-treated lung also increased significantly, confirming the fibrosis observed in the electron micrographs. These structural changes were accompanied by decreased lung ACE and plasminogen activator (PLA) activities, indicative of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction. Concomitant CL242817 treatment ameliorated all anatomic manifestations of monocrotaline injury, particularly the right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary arterial occlusion, epithelial degeneration, and interstitial fibrosis. CL242817 also significantly prevented the monocrotaline-induced increase in lung hydroxyproline content. In contrast, concomitant CL242817 did not significantly influence the suppressed lung ACE and PLA activities in monocrotaline-treated rats. CL242817 alone produced retarded weight gain, decreased heart weight relative to body weight, decreased lung hydroxyproline content and ACE activity, and increased serum ACE activity and plasma AII concentration. Thus CL242817 resembles captopril, both in its ability to ameliorate monocrotaline-induced pulmonary injury in rats, and in many of its side effects.", 
    "66": "Studies in the once-through perfused rat liver with the simultaneous delivery of 14 C-enalapril and its polar diacid metabolite, 3H-enalaprilat, revealed different extents of elimination (exclusively by biliary excretion) for the generated (14C-enalaprilat) and preformed (3H-enalaprilat) metabolite (18 and 5% dose) [Pang, Cherry, Terrell, and Ulm: Drug Metab. Dispos. 12, 309-313 (1984)]. The present re-examination of data provided an explanation for these discrepant observations: enalaprilat, being a polar dicarboxylic acid, encounters more of a diffusional barrier than its precursor, enalapril, an ethyl ester of enalaprilat. Programs written in Fortran 77 on mass balance relationships were employed to simulate data upon varying the diffusional clearances for drug (CLd) and metabolite [CLd(mi)] from 1 to 5000 ml/min. The metabolic and biliary intrinsic clearances for drug and metabolite were found by trial and error such that the combinations of all clearance parameters yielded data similar to enalaprilat, and 3H-enalaprilat. Our finding indicated that the diffusional clearance for enalaprilat was low (2 ml/min) compared to that of enalapril (75 ml/min). The presence of a diffusional barrier for enalaprilat retards entry of the preformed metabolite into hepatocytes but prevents efflux of the intracellularly formed generated metabolite into sinusoidal blood, thereby enhancing generated metabolite elimination.", 
    "67": "Intravenous administration to pithed Wistar rats of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) lowered the diastolic blood pressure and reduced pressor responses occurring during electrical stimulation (1-30 Hz) of the spinal sympathetic outflow. These doses of enalapril given intravenously also attenuated pressor responses to intravenous injection of the muscarinic ganglion stimulant McNeil-A-343 (50, 100, 150 micrograms/kg) and noradrenaline (0.1-5.0 micrograms/kg). Enalapril (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced pressor responses to the nicotinic ganglion stimulant 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium (300 micrograms/kg, i.v.). These results confirmed that the actions of enalapril resemble those of captopril in the pithed rat, by causing reductions in both blood pressure and pressor responses to sympathetic stimuli.", 
    "68": "An inhibitory peptide of angiotensin-converting enzyme was purified from porcine plasma. The final preparation showed IC50 values of 4.2, 0.6, and 0.9 microgram/ml for angiotensin-converting enzymes from guinea pig serum, rabbit lung, and monkey brain, respectively. The amino acid sequence of the inhibitor was determined as leucyl-valyl-leucine by Edman procedure. This structural observation was supported by mass spectrometric analysis.", 
    "69": "A peptidase that cleaved neurotensin at the Pro10-Tyr11 peptide bond, leading to the formation of neurotensin-(1-10) and neurotensin-(11-13), was purified nearly to homogeneity from rat brain synaptic membranes. The enzyme appeared to be monomeric with a molecular weight of about 70,000-75,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography filtration. Isoelectrofocusing indicated a pI of 5.9-6. The purified peptidase could be classified as a neutral metallopeptidase with respect to its sensitivity to pH and metal chelators. Thiol-blocking agents and acidic and serine protease inhibitors had no effect. Studies with specific peptidase inhibitors clearly indicated that the purified enzyme was distinct from enzymes capable of cleaving neurotensin at the Pro10-Tyr11 bond such as proline endopeptidase and endopeptidase 24-11. The enzyme was also distinct from other neurotensin-degrading peptidases such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and a recently purified rat brain soluble metalloendopeptidase. The peptidase displayed a high affinity for neurotensin (Km = 2.6 microM). Studies on its specificity revealed that neurotensin-(9-13) was the shortest neurotensin partial sequence that was able to fully inhibit [3H]neurotensin degradation. Shortening the C-terminal end of the neurotensin molecule as well as substitutions in positions 8, 9, and 11 by D-amino acids strongly decreased the inhibitory potency of neurotensin. Among 20 natural peptides, only angiotensin I and the neurotensin-related peptides (xenopsin and neuromedin N) were found as potent as unlabeled neurotensin.", 
    "70": "The influence of angiotensin II on kidney function in diabetic nephropathy was assessed by studying the effect of 12 weeks' monotherapy with captopril (25-50 mg twice a day) in 16 hypertensive insulin dependent diabetic patients with persistent albuminuria. In an initial one week randomised single blind trial of captopril versus placebo, captopril (for nine patients) reduced arterial blood pressure from 148/94 (SD11/6) to 135/88 (8/7) mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and albuminuria from 1549 (range 352-2238) to 1170 (297-2198) micrograms/min (p less than 0.05), while glomerular filtration rate remained stable. No significant changes occurred in seven patients treated with placebo. During the 12 weeks of captopril treatment arterial blood pressure in all patients fell from 147/94 (11/6) to 135/86 (13/7) mm Hg (p less than 0.01), albuminuria fell from 1589 (range 168-2588) to 1075 (35-2647) micrograms/min (p less than 0.01), and glomerular filtration rate fell from 99 (SD19) to 93 (25) ml/min/1.73 m2 (p less than 0.01). The renin-angiotensin system showed suppressed plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and increased concentrations of angiotensin I and renin. The study showed that glomerular filtration rate is not dependent on angiotensin II, that captopril reduces albuminuria, probably by lowering glomerular hypertension, and that captopril represents a valuable new drug for treating hypertension in diabetics dependent on insulin with nephropathy.", 
    "71": "The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril were investigated in patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. After nine days' treatment with captopril glomerular filtration rate was unchanged in 13 patients, whereas renal plasma flow had increased from 265 to 302 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface area (p less than 0.05) and the filtration fraction had decreased from 14.3 to 12.8% (p less than 0.025). During two years' treatment with captopril in 14 patients the mean arterial blood pressure had fallen by 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) and the deterioration in glomerular filtration rate had decreased from 10.3 to 2.4 ml/min/year (p less than 0.005). There was no correlation between the fall in blood pressure and the reduction in the deterioration of glomerular filtration rate. These findings suggest that the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on renal haemodynamics protect renal function. Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme should be considered for lowering blood pressure in patients with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "72": "In the Medical Research Council trial for the treatment of mild hypertension, bendrofluazide showed an unexpected and sizeable benefit compared with propranolol in the reduction of stroke. It is suggested that this difference reflects the opposing actions of these drugs on the renin-angiotensin system. The hypothesis that angiotensin-II protects the distal smaller cerebral vessels, which are the usual site of vessel rupture in intracerebral haemorrhage, indicates that long-term benefit of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension cannot be assumed.", 
    "73": "The tissue protective effect of iloprost against anoxia was studied in the isolated perfused rat lung. The change in angiotensin converting enzyme activity was taken as a sign of the biochemical activity of pulmonary vascular endothelium and was measured by bioassay of the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. A significant decrease in angiotensin converting enzyme activity was observed in the lungs incubated with Krebs alone and exposed to anoxia for 2 h. The decrease in angiotensin converting enzyme activity following anoxia for 2 and 24 h was prevented by prior pretreatment with iloprost. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II was significantly enhanced following anoxia and iloprost prevented this potentiation. The prevention by iloprost of the decrease in angiotensin converting enzyme activity and increase in the pressor response to angiotensin II was attributed to damage of pulmonary vascular endothelium during anoxia. Possible underlying mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "74": "The present study was performed to investigate the effect of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril on vascular synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2). Administration of ramipril (Hoe 498) to rats significantly stimulated prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis, quantified by radioimmunoassay of its stable hydrolysis product 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, by portions of the animals' isolated aorta. This effect was maximal at a dose range of 10(-7) mol/kg ramipril. The addition of the active ramipril metabolite ramipril diacid directly into the incubation buffer at final concentrations of 10(-9), 10(-6), and 10(-4) M resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha released by isolated aortic tissue. Pretreatment of rats with aprotinin (40,000 U s.c. 60 min before the incubations) attenuated the ramipril-induced effect on aortic 6-keto-PGF1 alpha synthesis. Our results show that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril stimulates PGI2 synthesis in vascular tissue and that this effect may be secondary to changes in the activity of the kinin system.", 
    "75": "A carboxypeptidase inhibitor (DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidoethylthiopropranoic acid) (mergetpa) was used to block the conversion of kinins and B2 receptor antagonists into metabolites devoid of the C-terminal Arg. Experiments were carried out on rabbit isolated aortae (a B1 receptor system) or rabbit jugular veins and dog carotid arteries (two B2 receptor systems). The contractile effect of bradykinin in the rabbit aorta was significantly reduced by mergetpa while that of desArg9-BK was not modified. pA2 values of B2 receptor antagonists, [Thi5,8,D-Phe7]bradykinin and [Thi6,9,D-Phe8]kallidin were markedly reduced by mergetpa. The apparent affinity (pA2) of a B1 receptor antagonist, [Leu9]desArg10-kallidin was not affected. Carboxypeptidases inhibition did not modify the activities of bradykinin or the affinities of B2 receptor antagonists in the rabbit jugular vein and the dog carotid artery. An inhibitor of kininase II (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropranoyl-L-proline (S,S] (captopril) reduced the contractile effects of angiotensin I in the three preparations and potentiated the stimulatory or inhibitory effects of bradykinin: captopril did not have effect on the affinities of B2 receptor antagonists and did not modify the effects of angiotensin II. Comparative experiments performed in tissues with or without endothelium gave the same results with both mergetpa and captopril. The present findings suggest that bradykinin and B2 receptor antagonists are converted by carboxypeptidases into biologically active B1 receptor agonist or antagonists. This is the reason why B2 receptor antagonists are not selective.", 
    "76": "The contents of [Met5]-enkephalin and its four hydrolysis products, Tyr, Tyr-Gly, Tyr-Gly-Gly, and Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe, in the sample obtained after enkephalin was incubated with tissues in either the absence or the presence of the peptidase inhibitor were estimated by high performance liquid chromatography combined with electrochemical detection in order to elucidate the effect of the peptidase inhibitor on enkephalin hydrolysis. Free Tyr was the major degradative product in the absence of the peptidase inhibitor, while the major hydrolysis product was the Tyr-Gly-Gly fragment in the presence of amastatin in both total homogenates and membrane fractions prepared from either the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle strip of guinea-pig ileum or the striatum of guinea-pig brain. Additionally, captopril significantly decreased the generation of Tyr-Gly-Gly in the presence of amastatin in both ileal and striatal membrane fractions. Moreover, thiorphan significantly prevented the formation of Tyr-Gly in the presence of both amastatin and captopril in both membrane preparations. Finally, when [Met5]-enkephalin was incubated with either an ileal or a striatal membrane fraction for 60 min at 37 degrees C in the presence of three peptidase inhibitors, amastatin, captopril, and thiorphan, approximately 98 or 94%, respectively, of enkephalin remained intact. The results indicated that [Met5]-enkephalin was almost exclusively hydrolyzed by three distinct enzymes, amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, captopril-sensitive peptidyl dipeptidase A, and thiorphan-sensitive endopeptidase-24.11 in both ileal and striatal membrane fractions.", 
    "77": "Nephrotic range proteinuria occurred in a 42-year-old woman with renal arterial occlusion and hyperreninemia. The administration of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, led to an amelioration of the proteinuria and the decrease of blood pressure, without surgical treatment. From the present observation, it is highly probably that the increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in massive proteinuria. Conservative treatment for renovascular hypertension with nephrotic syndrome was effective in this patient.", 
    "78": "The effect of a new drug, captopril, an inhibitor of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, were examined in 15 patients with chronic circulatory insufficiency in the presence of coronary heart disease. The efficiency of single doses and four-week courses of the drug was assessed. Captopril was shown to reduce significantly pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure and total peripheral resistance and increase the minute volume, thus improving left-ventricular function. Considering good tolerance of the drug, it can be recommended for the treatment of chronic circulatory insufficiency.", 
    "79": "ACE inhibitors are not available in India. Response to captopril in comparison with M-dopa was therefore seen in Indian hypertensive patients. A double blind randomized non-crossover study was carried out on 39 adult patients of either sex suffering from essential hypertension. Twenty-five patients included were resistant to earlier drug therapy. The remaining 14 were freshly detected hypertensive patients. Patients received either 150 mg/day captopril (Aceten) or 750 mg/day M-dopa in 3 equally divided doses every day for 30 days. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in captopril (Aceten) group before starting drug therapy was 171 +/- 4.11 (mean +/- SE) and 111 +/- 0.22, respectively. At the end of therapy the systolic blood pressure was 132 +/- 1.86 and diastolic blood pressure was 84 +/- 1.36 mm of mercury. This fall in the blood pressure within the group was statistically highly significant (p less than 0.001). Similarly patients on M-dopa produced statistically highly significant fall in blood pressure (p less than 0.001) at the end of 4 weeks therapy. Initial systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both groups were comparable and, at the end of 2 and 4 weeks therapy, patients on captopril (Aceten) showed greater fall in both systolic (p less than 0.001) and diastolic (p less than 0.005) blood pressure than patients on M-dopa. None of the patients in the trial demonstrated clinically significant changes in the biochemical parameters. Six of nineteen patients on methyl dopa had side effects which are well known to this drug. None in the captopril showed any side effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "A 53-year-old man with scleroderma and severe renal failure was treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Adequate control of blood pressure was achieved with this single agent and an impressive improvement of renal function followed. This case illustrates many features of the syndrome of \"scleroderma renal crisis\" and supports the use of captopril for its treatment.", 
    "81": "IgG anti-captopril (CP) antibody activity was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum from two out of 45 patients receiving the drug (25-75 mg day-1). Five of the 45 patients, including one whose serum was antibody-positive, suffered skin rashes which were thought to be drug-induced. The specificity of the antibody for the disulphide-conjugated form of captopril was established as follows: serum IgG bound to disulphide-linked captopril-human albumin (CP-S-S-HSA) conjugate but not to HSA; binding of IgG to CP-S-S-HSA was inhibited by disulphide-linked captopril-ovalbumin (CP-S-S-OVA) conjugate and captopril disulphide (CP-S-S-CP). The structurally related drug D-penicillamine (PA) in disulphide-linked form (PA-S-S-OVA and PA-S-S-PA) was without inhibitory activity. The inhibitory preparations of CP-S-S-OVA and CP-S-S-CP were shown to be inactive in an ELISA for human IgG directed against the unrelated benzylpenicilloyl antigen. Since disulphide-linked CP-plasma protein conjugates are formed extensively in vivo, and since the antibodies we describe are directed against CP in disulphide-linked form, it appears that CP may be immunogenic in some patients receiving the drug.", 
    "82": "The object of this study was to investigate the renal component of hypertension in aortic constriction. In 40-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats the aorta were constricted either proximal (PAC) or distal (DAC) to the renal arteries. The rats were examined 3 weeks later together with control rats. The arterial pressure proximal to the constriction was elevated in the PAC group but not in the DAC group. In PAC rats the arterial pressure was also elevated distal to the constriction. There was a significant pressure gradient across the constriction in both PAC and DAC rats. The PAC rats had a significant decrease of renal blood flow, a significant increase in renal vascular resistance and a numerical but not significant decrease of glomerular filtration rate. Serum levels of angiotensin II were not significantly different in PAC and control rats. The pressor effect of a bolus dose of angiotensin II was significantly increased in PAC rats. Captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, decreased the arterial pressures and renal vascular resistance in PAC rats. The pressure elevating effects of angiotensin II and pressure lowering effect of captopril were more pronounced distal than proximal to the constriction. We conclude that the kidneys play a major role in the development of hypertension in PAC, and that the local effect of angiotensin II on the renal vascular bed is an important contributor to the renal component of the hypertension.", 
    "83": "The antihypertensive effect of blockade of the brain renin-angiotensin system (brain RAS) was investigated in DOCA (deoxycorticosterone acetate)-salt hypertensive rats. Continuous intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of SQ14225 (SQ; 1.25 micrograms X 0.5 microliter-1 X h-1) for 7 days attenuated the increase in blood pressure (99 +/- 5 vs. 116 +/- 4 mmHg on the 7th day) and also reduced the elevation of blood pressure (157 +/- 7 vs. 138 +/- 6 mmHg) in these hypertensive rats. Attenuation of increasing blood pressure in the developing phase following ICV SQ treatment was accompanied by decrease of fluid intake and prevention of elevation of the plasma vasopressin. In the established phase, in addition to reduction of the plasma vasopressin and decrease of fluid intake, restoration of the impaired baroreceptor reflexes was brought about by ICV SQ treatment. These results indicate that the brain RAS strongly influences the regulation of blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats and that its mechanism of action is closely related to changes in sodium excretion, vasopressin, and the baroreceptor reflexes.", 
    "84": "Captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension, has been associated with hematologic as well as dermatologic side effects. Two patients with captopril-induced angioneurotic edema, one of whom had fatal granulocytopenia and overwhelming polymicrobial sepsis, are presented.", 
    "85": "The effects of 4 weeks of captopril treatment were studied in 10 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Acute administration of 50 mg of captopril resulted in an increase in cardiac index and significant decreases in arterial pressure, peripheral vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Before treatment, all patients had elevated vasopressin levels (17 +/- 4 pg/ml) relative to decreased plasma osmolality (274 +/- 15 mOsm/kg H2O), and these values were not initially affected by captopril administration (22 +/- 7 pg/ml). However, the relation between arginine vasopressin and plasma osmolality was restored to normal by long-term therapy with captopril (50 mg 3 times daily) (3.0 +/- 1.3 pg/ml; 283 +/- 166 mOsm/kg H2O), which also resulted in sustained improvement of cardiac function. Long-term captopril therapy increased plasma renin concentration from already elevated levels (11 +/- 4 to 32 +/- 8 ng AI/ml X hour) and decreased plasma norepinephrine from 1,054 +/- 244 to 488 +/- 101 pg/ml. Thus, nonosmolar stimulation of vasopressin secretion in CHF can be restored to normal by chronic converting enzyme blockade. The acute vasodilator effects of converting enzyme blockade are not mediated by a reduction of possible vasoconstrictor effects of vasopressin.", 
    "86": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were measured in 19 cases with primary aldosteronism (PA) and in 72 with essential hypertension (EHT) to differentiate the two disorders during the following conditions on normal salt diet: after overnight recumbency (basal state) and 2 hours after oral administration of 25 mg of captopril. Screening criteria were determined so that all PA patients were diagnosed as positive, and their specificities were compared with those of other conventional screening methods for PA. After captopril administration, the specificity of a criterion based on a combination of PAC and PAC/PRA ratio was 93% and positive predictive value was 79%. This criterion was superior to blood pressure response to angiotension II analog infusion, PRA on salt depletion, and to PAC on salt loading. However, higher specificity (97%) and positive predictive value (90%) were obtained from a criterion based on a combination of basal PAC and PAC/PRA ratio. Therefore, the use of a combination criterion based on PAC and PAC/PRA ratio at basal state rather than after captopril administration may give a satisfactory result in the screening for PA.", 
    "87": "In an effort to improve on the noninvasive detection of renal artery stenosis, we investigated the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on computer-assisted 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) renal flow studies in a canine model of two-kidney, one clip hypertension and compared these findings with clearances of inulin and p-aminohippuric acid in the stenotic and contralateral kidney before and after converting enzyme inhibition. The 99mTc-DTPA renal flow study with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (1.5 mg/kg bolus with 1.5 mg/min infusion) showed an increased sensitivity in the detection of unilateral renal artery stenosis over the use of the 99mTc-DTPA study alone. Captopril induced striking alterations that were most evident in the 15-minute 99mTc-DTPA renal flow study, in which all nine curves exhibited severely blunted uptake and excretion of the radionuclide. These changes were reversed during a recovery study without converting enzyme inhibition and were not seen when blood pressure was lowered with nitroprusside to a level similar to that observed during converting enzyme inhibition. The changes shown by the 99mTc-DTPA study during converting enzyme inhibition correlated with a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate of the stenotic kidney. Captopril infusion significantly decreased the glomerular filtration rate of the stenotic kidney (16.0 +/- 3.1 vs 11.0 +/- 2.5 mg/min, p less than 0.03) but not of the contralateral kidney (32.4 +/- 2.6 vs 28.4 +/- 2.8 mg/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Changes in circulating catecholamines and transmyocardial catecholamine balance associated with improved left ventricular function were studied in patients with chronic heart failure after treatment with captopril (10 patients) and hydralazine in combination with isosorbide dinitrate (eight patients). Cardiac performance improved in response to both captopril and hydralazine-nitrate treatment. The systemic haemodynamic effects were also qualitatively similar, but the hydralazine-nitrate combination caused a greater increase in cardiac index and heart rate. Captopril did not change arterial adrenaline concentrations (0.63 to 0.60 nmol/l), arterial noradrenaline (4.2 to 3.9 nmol/l), or net transmyocardial noradrenaline release (390 to 317 pmol/min), while hydralazine-nitrate increased arterial adrenaline (0.91 to 1.47 nmol/l) and transmyocardial noradrenaline release (225 to 554 pmol/min). Although both captopril and hydralazine-nitrate treatment improve left ventricular performance in patients with chronic heart failure, hydralazine-nitrate enhances cardiac sympathetic tone and captopril does not. The clinical relevance of these findings, however, is not known.", 
    "89": "The relation of thirst to the renin-angiotensin system was examined in 38 patients with chronic renal failure receiving hemodialysis treatment. They were classified into three groups, ie, group 1 (19 patients), no or modest thirst; group 2 (13 patients), moderate thirst; and group 3 (six patients), excessive thirst. The plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II levels, and interdialytic weight gains of groups 1 to 3 significantly increased in a progressive manner with intensity of thirst. The hyperdipsia experienced by four patients in group 3 ameliorated after administration of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. The hyperdipsia of some patients with chronic renal failure therefore appears to be mediated by increased production of endogenous angiotensin II.", 
    "90": "Administration of 25 mg of captopril to 10 patients with heart failure (NYHA II, III) produces at rest after 60 min bradycardia (-7 per cent, p less than 0.01), hypotension (-8 per cent) and improvement of the preload (-30 per cent, p less than 0.01). This effect is still apparent after two months of treatment where PAP is decreased by 20 per cent (p less than 0.05). A prolonged effect of captopril is present in these 10 patients. The capacity to perform a muscular exercise on an ergometric bicycle is prolonged by 10 per cent (p less than 0.01) on the first day and by 18 per cent (p less than 0.01) after two months of treatment. This improvement seems to be related to improvement of the hemodynamic parameters, especially of preload indices. In 5 patients, lactacidemia, the arterio-venous difference and the extraction coefficient of O2 were studied at rest and during exercise. No significant difference are noted after the treatment with the inhibitors of conversion enzymes.", 
    "91": "Ten patients with primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension who had normal left ventricular function (group I) and nine patients with pulmonary hypertension in response to impaired left ventricular function (group II) were given captopril. At peak effect (1.5 hours after administration) pulmonary vascular resistance fell from 935 to 717 dyn X s X cm-5 in group I and from 554 to 355 dyn X s X cm-5 in group II in association with a decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure by 8 and 12 mmHg, respectively (p less than 0.01). Systemic vascular resistance declined by 26 and 29 per cent, and cardiac index increased by 17 and 20 per cent, respectively (p less than 0.01). On re-catheterization four to 15 months later, seven chronically treated patients (five of group I; two of group II) showed additional reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance (25 per cent) and pulmonary arterial pressure (20 per cent), whereas systemic hemodynamics had almost reached pre-treatment values. All patients reported symptomatic improvement. The hemodynamic changes did not correlate with concomitant alterations in circulating renin or angiotensin II levels. These data suggest that captopril can produce sustained hemodynamic and clinical benefits in patients with pulmonary hypertension of various causes and may be useful for the chronic treatment of this disorder.", 
    "92": "The hypotensive and hormonal effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (10 mg twice daily) were compared with those of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg twice daily), with the two drugs in combination and with placebo in 21 patients with essential hypertension. For each patient there were four randomised double-blind treatment phases, each of four weeks' duration, which comprised a 2 X 2 factorial experiment. All blood pressure parameters were reduced in the three active treatment phases compared to placebo (p less than 0.001). Supine mean blood pressures were 119 mmHg (placebo), 113 mmHg (hydrochlorothiazide), 108 mmHg (enalapril), and 98 mmHg (hydrochlorothiazide plus enalapril) (SEM 3 mmHg, ANOVA). Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide were equally effective and well tolerated and their hypotensive effects were additive. Enalapril increased plasma renin activity (PRA), reduced plasma angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone concentrations, and reduced ACE activity, whereas hydrochlorothiazide increased PRA, plasma AII, and aldosterone concentrations without altering ACE activity. With combination treatment the effects of enalapril on PRA and plasma AII concentrations were potentiated whereas those on plasma aldosterone concentration and ACE activity were additive. Atrial natriuretic factor plasma concentration in the placebo phase was 92 pg/ml and increased to 145 pg/ml in the hydrochlorothiazide phase (p less than 0.001, SEM 13 pg/ml), but there was no significant change in either the enalapril or combination phases.", 
    "93": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril proved to be an effective antihypertensive drug during a 5-year follow-up study of patients with severe hypertension who had been resistant to a triple-drug regimen. Of the 42 patients, 41 had to be treated additionally with diuretics. Because of hypokalemia, potassium supplements were necessary in 26 patients, despite the use of \"potassium-saving\" diuretics in 12 patients. Blood pressure was controlled sufficiently in 3/4 of the patients during the 5 years. Patients with a large elevation in plasma renin activity showed the best response to the treatment. Six patients died during the 5 years. Therapy had to be stopped in 11 patients because of complications. The following complications and adverse effects were observed: cerebral ischemia (n = 10), vertigo and orthostasis (10), exanthema (9), hypogeusia (7), circulatory failure (7), myocardial infarction (6), and scintigraphically demonstrable decrease of renal perfusion (5). One patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis suffered from acute renal failure, which was reversible after withdrawal of captopril. Significant changes of red and white blood cell counts, transaminases, lipids, urine protein excretion, and heart rate were not observed.", 
    "94": "In a double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study 12 patients with essential hypertension received single doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg of cilazapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. All doses similarly and significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced supine and erect blood pressure without increasing heart rate. The hypotensive effect was evident within 1 h, maintained for up to 8 h, with a maximal effect at 6 h. There was no discernible effect on blood pressure at 24 h after dosing. Plasma ACE activity was markedly inhibited to the same extent after all doses, with a peak inhibition of 94-96% at 2-3 h. At 24 h residual inhibition of ACE was 49-54%. Plasma renin activity increased in a dose-dependent manner with a peak at 6 h, and returned to baseline at 24 h. No correlation was found between the reduction in blood pressure and plasma renin activity, either at baseline or following cilazapril. There were no significant changes in plasma noradrenaline and the responses to upright posture and to dynamic exercise were preserved. There was no evidence of impaired exercise performance. Cilazapril is a potent ACE inhibitor with a rapid onset and a prolonged duration of action. These results suggest that peak ACE inhibition is achieved by 5 mg and that lower doses may be useful in clinical practice.", 
    "95": "A severe non-dose related skin eruption attributable to treatment with captopril was recently reported: this is distinct from the dose related rashes that have been widely described. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies were carried out to determine in detail the histological features of this eruption: the histological appearances were similar to those found in early mycosis fungoides, so that this disease was erroneously diagnosed in one case. Unlike most other complications resulting from treatment with Captopril, an indistinguishable rash can result from treatment with enalapril, a newer angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "96": "Two groups of rats were pair fed, for 18 days, diets containing either 2.6 (Zn deficient) or 100 mg Zn/kg (control diet). Plasma was assayed spectrophotometrically for the activity of kininase-I and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the presence of varying concentrations of added Zn2+. Zinc deficient rats had only 76% of the activity of both kininase-I and ACE compared with zinc supplemented control rats. There was a significant linear relationship between enzyme activity and concentration of zinc in plasma for both enzymes. When zinc was added to the enzyme incubation mixture for zinc deficient rats, the activity of ACE increased by 73% and that of kininase-I by 33%. This Zn2+-stimulated increase in enzyme activity was negatively correlated with the in vivo concentration of zinc in plasma, and a plateau in enzyme activity was seen at concentrations of plasma zinc that were commensurate with normal zinc status (over 14 mumol/1). The results demonstrate that the activities of both kininase-I and ACE are dependent on the concentration of zinc in vivo and in vitro, and suggest that information concerning the concentration of zinc in plasma and assay solutions be a prerequisite solutions be a prerequisite for the use of these enzymes in the clinical diagnosis of disease states. The results also showed that the activity of ACE and kininase-I in plasma could be used for the biochemical diagnosis of a suboptimal zinc status.", 
    "97": "To evaluate the relative contribution of endogenous vasoactive compounds to maintenance of increased renal vascular resistance in neonatal obstructive nephropathy, cardiac output and renal blood flow were measured using radioactive microspheres in 25 +/- 3 day-old guinea pigs subjected to unilateral partial ureteral constriction within the first two days of life. Mass and renal blood flow of the obstructed kidney were significantly lower than those of the contralateral kidney. Following a control period, thromboxane synthesis was blocked by infusion of OKY-046, after which prostaglandin synthesis was inhibited by indomethacin. In a separate group of animals, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, MK-422, was infused before or after administration of OKY-046. While neither OKY-046 nor indomethacin had a consistent effect on vascular resistance, infusion of MK-422 resulted in selective reduction of renal vascular resistance of the obstructed kidney compared to resistance in the intact kidney and other vascular beds. Removal of the contralateral kidney at the time of ureteral constriction in an additional group of animals resulted in hypertrophy and vasodilation of the obstructed kidney which was not altered by thromboxane or cyclooxygenase inhibition. We conclude that in the neonatal kidney subjected to ipsilateral chronic partial ureteral obstruction, vasoconstriction is mediated at least in part by angiotensin II, but not by thromboxane. Furthermore, vasodilation of the obstructed kidney resulting from contralateral nephrectomy is not dependent on prostaglandin synthesis. Renal vascular resistance of the kidney with prolonged partial ureteral constriction in early development thus appears to be inversely related to renal growth and is not significantly mediated by endogenous prostanoids.", 
    "98": "Renal function was measured sequentially in 32 patients with proven renovascular hypertension who were treated with the oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Renal function was assessed by serial measurement of serum creatinine. Six patients showed acute rises in serum creatinine concentration compatible with acute renal failure. Acute renal failure was confined to those patients with stenosis to a solitary kidney (transplant or native, occurring in 3 of 8 patients) or bilateral renal artery stenosis (occurring in 3 of 13 patients). No rise in serum creatinine concentration was observed in 11 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis during long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Acute renal failure during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy was not related to the degree of blood pressure fall or the plasma angiotensin II level. Eleven patients with renovascular hypertension were followed prospectively with estimation of renal function by 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) clearance (determined by computer analysis of scintillation camera renography). In six patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis, total 99mTc-DTPA clearance and serum creatinine level remained constant following angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, while in five patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis 99mTc-DTPA clearance fell from 40 +/- 9 to 27 +/- 5 ml/min (p less than 0.05). Split renal function studies revealed that 99mTc-DTPA clearance fell in most kidneys with stenosed arteries during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, including the stenosed kidney from patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis (16 stenosed kidneys studied; change in Tc-DTPA clearance, -7.5 +/- 2.7 ml/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "99": "The challenge to the clinician is the need to choose among an array of antihypertensive agents in order to arrive at a regimen that is not only effective but also safe and convenient. Tailoring the regimen to the individual patient requires careful consideration of the pathophysiologic mechanisms that may be operative, concurrent risk factors and diseases, previous responses to other antihypertensive agents and the patient's general lifestyle, including diet and exercise.", 
    "100": "Angiotensin II, the potent hypertensive octapeptide, can be generated by a sequential cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal leucine and histidine from angiotensin I by a human renal extract. This extract does not hydrolyze further the resulting octapeptide. The more widely recognized biosynthetic pathway is by the extracellular dipeptide cleavage of angiotensin I by an enzyme which also degrades bradykinin, i.e., angiotensin converting enzyme. The presence of a carboxypeptidase activity capable of generating but not further hydrolyzing angiotensin II was observed in an ammonium sulfate fraction of a human renal extract. This novel enzymatic activity is distinct from angiotensin converting enzyme activity in that it is not dependent upon calcium and is not inhibited by known angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "101": "Thirty-nine general practice patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were treated with enalapril 10 to 40 mg once daily alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg once daily for 20 weeks. Eighty-one percent of patients responded with a satisfactory reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure, and 58% became normotensive. No serious adverse clinical or laboratory effects were noted. Enalapril alone or in combination with low dose diuretic administered once daily was an effective alternative regimen for mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "102": "When captopril was injected intravenously in urethane anesthetized rats, a hypotensive effect accompanied by bradycardia was obtained, while an intravenous (i.v.) injection of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), which induced hypotension of the same magnitude as the hypotensive effect obtained with captopril, caused a marked tachycardia. Simultaneously, sympathetic nerve activity recorded from abdominal sympathetic nerves was unchanged following injection of captopril, while it was significantly increased during hypotension induced by PGI2. The bradycardia, but not the hypotensive effects induced by captopril was abolished by i.v. pretreatment with atropine. Intracisternal injection of a small dose of captopril inhibited reflex tachycardia during hypotension induced by PGI2 and prolonged the hypotensive effect, while intravenous administration of this dose did not inhibit the reflex tachycardia induced by PGI2. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the hypotensive effect of captopril was increased partly, however, the accompanying bradycardia was significantly reduced. These findings suggest that captopril inhibits the baroreflex and centrally activates the cardiac vagal nerve. Moreover in SHR, the effect of captopril on cardiac vagal activity was disturbed.", 
    "103": "Using a sensitive radioimmunoassay, the tripeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly (YGG) which corresponds to the N-terminal sequence of opioid peptides was detected in rat brain and identified by HPLC. Its regional distribution paralleled that of (Met5)enkephalin (YGGFM), a marker of enkephalin neurons. Ablation of these neurons in the striato-pallidal pathway by intrastriatal kainate, induced a significant decrease in YGG levels in caudateputamen and globus pallidus (-49%), consistent with the hypothesis that YGG originates from enkephalin neurons. When pallidal slices were incubated under various conditions, YGG was mainly found in the incubation medium indicating a predominantly extracellular localization. Depolarization of these slices by a K+-stimulus elicited a release of YGGFM accompanied by a marked increase in YGG levels. Bestatin and amastatin further enhanced YGG levels, reflecting the participation of aminopeptidases in the metabolism of the tripeptide and its precursor. Captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) showed no effect on the recovery of YGGFM and YGG. In contrast, the formation of YGG was completely prevented by Thiorphan (IC50 value = 9 nM) and phosphoramidon, two inhibitors of \"enkephalinase\" (EC 3.4.24.11; membrane metallo-endopeptidase), thus identifying the latter as the YGG-forming enzyme. The K+-induced increase in YGG + YGGFM levels in medium containing bestatin exceeded by about 60% the amount of YGGFM released from tissues, suggesting that YGG was mainly formed by extracellular hydrolysis of the various opioid fragments of the proenkephalin molecule. In vivo, YGG levels of cerebral regions were also markedly reduced in rats treated with acetorphan, a parenterally active \"enkephalinase\" inhibitor. All data suggest that YGG levels constitute an index of opioid peptide release.", 
    "104": "A simple enzyme immunoassay for the determination of captopril was developed. A specific antibody for captopril was produced in rabbits that were immunized with a hapten-bovine immunoglobulin G conjugate, which was prepared by using 4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane carboxylic acid as a spacer group. The limit of detection in plasma is 0.5 ng/mL. The assay has an adequate specificity, so isolation of captopril is unnecessary.", 
    "105": "The study was aimed to show whether the renin-angiotensin system acts on erythropoiesis in chronic renal failure patients with hemodialysis, since captopril leads to the worsening of anemia in such patients. The average dose of captopril in 13 cases studied was 19.3 mg per day and duration of the administration was 48 days. Blood-pressure fall by captopril was accompanied with the worsening of anemia. There were significant decreases in hemoglobin (8.3%), hematocrit (7.3%), red blood cell count (7.6%) and reticulocyte count (43.7%). Angiotensin II was significantly decreased (15.7%) with significant reductions of plasma aldosterone concentration (15.2%) and angiotensin-I converting enzyme (45.7%), and with significant increases in plasma renin activity (158.6%) and in angiotensin I (238.3%). However, plasma erythropoietin concentration remained unchanged. Serum iron concentration was slightly but significantly increased after captopril. Reticulocyte count was significantly correlated with AII either before (r = 0.716, p less than 0.01) or after captopril (r = 0.658, p less than 0.05). There was significant correlation between angiotensin II and red blood cell count before captopril (r = 0.710, p less than 0.01). It is concluded from the present study that the reduction of angiotensin II by captopril might contribute to the worsening of anemia seen in chronic hemodialysis patients.", 
    "106": "The effect of captopril as long-term treatment in 20 patients with congestive heart failure has been studied in a double-blind trial. Captopril caused a significant increase in serum digoxin levels. No patients developed evidence of digoxin toxicity. Serum and total body potassium rose and the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias showed a modest decline. Creatinine clearance and radioisotopically measured glomerular filtration rate fell, but there was a poor relationship between these and the increase in serum digoxin. In a further open study on 12 patients, creatinine, urea, and digoxin clearance were significantly reduced by captopril. However, digoxin clearance declined more than creatinine clearance (89 +/- 25 mumol/L to 69 +/- 22 mumol/L and 81 +/- 14 mumol/L to 72 +/- 19 mumol/L, respectively, p less than 0.05 for the difference). Fractional excretion of urea and digoxin filtered at the glomerulus declined, indicating greater tubular reabsorption or reduced tubular secretion of these compounds. Captopril causes an increase in serum digoxin by reducing renal clearance of the drug.", 
    "107": "The normal lung is the site of intense metabolic activity, largely associated with the endothelial cell. Depressed pulmonary metabolic function is seen in a wide variety of experimental animal models of acute lung injury, and is also demonstrated in ARDS patients. The evaluation of lung metabolic activity may prove to be a sensitive probe for the detection of the earliest phases of acute lung injury, as well as a guide to the severity of injury or response to therapy. Depressed lung metabolic function may play a role in the intrapulmonary and/or systemic pathophysiology of ARDS.", 
    "108": "To study peripheral mechanisms underlying cardiovascular responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) we recorded the effects of i.c.v. infusions of TRH in urethane-anesthetized rats after various drug pretreatments, nephrectomy or renal denervation. TRH invariably increased blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity. After alpha-1 adrenergic blockade with prazosin, pressor responses to TRH were delayed in onset and reduced in magnitude. After renal denervation or pretreatment with propranolol for beta adrenergic blockade, captopril for converting enzyme inhibition or Sar1Ile8 angiotensin II for angiotensin II blockade, pressor responses to TRH were unaltered during the first few minutes but became significantly reduced thereafter. Bilateral nephrectomy inhibited markedly the whole pressor response including its onset and subsequent elevation. Consequently, initial inhibition by prazosin was considered due to removal of alpha-1 adrenergic vasoconstriction whereas the later attenuation was attributed to antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system. None of the procedures tested affected the attendant sympathetic hyperactivity, but the tachycardia was prevented by beta adrenergic blockade. These results are compatible with the interpretation that, by acting centrally, TRH stimulates sympathetic hyperactivity which then elevates blood pressure by increasing not only sympathetic vasomotor tone but also renal renin secretion.", 
    "109": "The effects of cimetidine (single or repeated administration) on free unchanged captopril plasma levels, pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma converting enzyme inhibitory effects have been investigated in normal healthy volunteers. Cimetidine affected neither captopril pharmacokinetic parameters nor its biological effects, suggesting that no change in captopril dosing is necessary when cimetidine is co-administered.", 
    "110": "Treatment with the potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril completely prevented any rise in blood pressure in the 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) model of renal hypertension in rats. Withdrawal of this inhibitor was followed by a slow rise in blood pressure. In 2K1C rats treated with perindopril, pressor responses to angiotensin I fell during the treatment period, but returned to normal after the inhibitor was stopped. Pressor responses to angiotensin II (AII) increased during treatment with perindopril; this was presumably due to increased receptor sensitivity consequent on the falls in endogenous AII levels. Responses to AII fell to control levels after the inhibitor was stopped. It is concluded that an increased pressor sensitivity to AII is not the cause of the slowly developing hypertension in the 2K1C model of hypertension, and that the slow pressor response to AII must be due to other factors.", 
    "111": "The reflex tachycardia to arterial vasodilation was analysed in anaesthetized and ventilated Long Evans rats. Nicardipine was given by slow intravenous injection. The decrease in blood pressure was accompanied by a sympathetically mediated reflex tachycardia. The slope of the mean blood pressure-pulse period relationship was considered as an index of baroreflex sensitivity. Two injections of nicardipine were given during a single experiment. For studying the suprapontine control of the baroreflex arc, rats were subjected to transient (10 min) bilateral hemispheric ischaemia. These rats exhibited a blood pressure drop following recirculation and baroreflex sensitivity was impaired. Pretreatment with alpha-methyldopa, guanfacine and enalapril lowered mean blood pressure to a similar extent. In those rats pretreated with alpha-methyldopa and guanfacine transient hemispheric ischaemia did not alter baroreflex sensitivity while enalapril pretreated rats exhibited an impaired baroreflex. The protective effect of alpha-methyldopa and guanfacine against the cardiovascular consequence of hemispheric ischaemia may depend on reduced monoamine turnover resulting from central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "112": "The influence of the renin-angiotensin system on whole-kidney and regional single-nephron function was studied in anesthetized Munich-Wistar rats by use of a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), captopril (3 mg . h-1 . kg-1 body wt-1). Single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) was measured in superficial (S) and juxtamedullary (JM) nephrons by a micropuncture technique that blocked tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) activity. Hydrostatic free-flow pressure (FFP) measurements were conducted in S proximal tubules, in JM loops of Henle, and in papillary vasa recta. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary electrolyte excretion were measured in the contralateral kidney. In the control situation SNGFR of S nephrons was 35.4 +/- 2.24 nl . min-1 . g kidney wt-1 and of JM nephrons was 75.0 +/- 9.41 nl . min-1 . g-1 kidney wt-1. Thus it was more than twice as high in JM as in S nephrons when the TGF activity was blocked. In this situation administration of CEI had no additional effect on either S or JM nephrons. However, administration of CEI resulted in a significant increase in whole-kidney GFR by 25% (P less than 0.05) and in urine flow rate by 60% (P less than 0.001) under free-flow conditions. Further, intratubular FFP increased significantly in JM nephrons by an average of 2.9 +/- 0.52 mmHg (P less than 0.001), indicating an increase in tubular urine flow in JM nephrons, whereas S nephrons were unaffected. These results suggest an active preglomerular vasoconstriction in JM nephrons under normal free-flow conditions. This seems to be mediated by TGF and modulated by angiotensin II.", 
    "113": "The acute hemodynamic and hormonal effects of the oral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril (MK-521) were assessed over a period of 96 hours in 12 patients with heart failure. This compound is the lysine analogue of enalaprilat (MK-422), is biologically active following absorption, and is cleared via the urine without any known metabolic transformation. Single doses of lisinopril, ranging from 1.25 mg to 10 mg, were administered on days 1 and 3, each followed by 48 hours of intensive hemodynamic observation. Across all doses, maximal reductions in mean arterial pressure (17.2%), mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (28%), and systemic vascular resistance (25.6%) were observed compared to baseline values. No significant changes in heart rate were recorded. Arterial blood was sampled at frequent intervals for angiotensin II, ACE activity, plasma renin activity, renin substrate, plasma aldosterone, and serum drug levels. Right atrial blood was sampled simultaneously for angiotensin I, thus permitting assessment of the degree of pulmonary conversion to angiotensin II. The results indicate potent inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system along with hemodynamic efficacy over a period exceeding 24 hours. Frequent clinical follow-up on long-term chronic therapy has revealed no adverse experience.", 
    "114": "Single pass extraction of a new iodinated inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was measured by means of indicator-dilution techniques applied to rabbit lungs, perfused in situ at 20 ml/min with Krebs bicarbonate solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin. A bolus containing the inhibitor, N-[1(S)-carboxy-(4-OH-3-125I-phenyl)ethyl]-L-Ala-L-Pro (CPAP), and an intravascular marker, [14C]dextran, was injected and extraction calculated at the peak of the resulting venous outflow-time curve. In 13 of 21 lungs used, a synthetic substrate for ACE, [3H]benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline (BPAP), was added to the bolus and appearance of its hydrolysis product, [3H]benzoyl-Phe, measured in effluent samples. When low amounts (0.15 nmol) of [125I]CPAP were injected, pulmonary extraction (E) of CPAP was 67 +/- 14% (X +/- S.D; n = 21) and metabolism (M) of BPAP was 56 +/- 9% (n = 13). Addition of unlabeled CPAP (3, 34 or 340 nmol) to the Addition of unlabeled CPAP (3, 34 or 340 nmol) to the injected bolus caused dose-dependent reduction of E(CPAP) and M(BPAP) that was no longer evident 10 min after the largest dose of CPAP. Coadministration of the ACE inhibitor, captopril (3, 6, 8 and 28 nmol), also caused dose-dependent, reversible depression of both E(CPAP) and M(BPAP). Accordingly, extraction of CPAP by perfused rabbit lung is saturable. Inasmuch as CPAP inhibits ACE activity (as reflected by BPAP metabolism) and CPAP uptake is inhibited by captopril (which also inhibits BPAP hydrolysis), it appears that a large portion of this saturable process probably reflects binding to vascular ACE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "115": "The in vivo effects of two anti-human renin monoclonal antibodies with a high binding affinity for primate renin were studied in conscious, volume-depleted marmosets. These antibodies, R-3-17-7 and R-3-36-16, both have high binding activity for renin, but only R-3-36-16 inhibits the enzymatic activity of renin in vitro. In vivo, R-3-17-7 did not affect blood pressure after intravenous injection of doses up to 100 micrograms/kg, although plasma renin activity was partially reduced. In contrast, R-3-36-16 induced a reduction in blood pressure and an inhibition of plasma renin activity at a threshold dose of 3 micrograms/kg. The maximum fall in blood pressure and complete inhibition of plasma renin activity were observed after R-3-36-16, 10 micrograms/kg; these effects persisted for up to 2 hours. Pretreatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor or nephrectomy prevented the hypotensive effects of R-3-36-16. Conversely, pretreatment with R-3-36-16 prevented the hypotensive effects of a converting enzyme inhibitor. These findings indicate that the hypotensive response induced by R-3-36-16 is due entirely to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Thus, R-3-36-16 appears to be a specific, potent, and long-acting inhibitor of primate renin. Such monoclonal antibodies provide interesting tools for studying the effects of acute and chronic renin blockade.", 
    "116": "The possible role of the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of hypertension in two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats was studied. Plasma renin activity rose rapidly and markedly in association with the elevation of blood pressure and then decreased gradually, although blood pressure remained high. Renin activity in the lung, aorta, and mesenteric artery also increased with the development of hypertension and then decreased in a way similar to that of plasma renin activity at the chronic stage of hypertension. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity did not change significantly until 16 weeks after unilateral renal artery clipping, whereas vascular angiotensin converting enzyme activity significantly increased at the chronic, but not the acute, stage of hypertension. In chronically renal hypertensive rats, 1-sarcosine, 8-isoleucine angiotensin II or enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lowered the blood pressure and enalapril also lowered the angiotensin converting enzyme activity of vascular tissues. The constrictor effect of angiotensin I was greater in isolated arteries from chronically hypertensive rats than in those from age-matched normotensive rats. These results suggest that the vascular renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the maintenance of two-kidney, one clip hypertension. Elevated vascular angiotensin converting enzyme activity appears to increase local production of angiotensin II, which results in vasoconstriction by acting directly and indirectly through adrenergic nerves on vascular smooth muscle.",

    "118": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, enalapril, HOE 498, and its prodrug on reperfusion arrhythmias after 15 min of coronary ligation were investigated in the isolated rat heart. Drug concentrations were equipotent in their effect on angiotensin I pressor response. Furthermore, the effect of indomethacin on ACE inhibition with captopril was studied. Upon reperfusion, ventricular fibrillation occurred in all untreated hearts, in all prodrug HOE 498-treated hearts (15 micrograms/ml), and in 4 of 6 of the enalapril-treated (8 micrograms/ml) hearts. In contrast, in only 2 of 6 (p less than 0.002) of the HOE 498-treated hearts (15 micrograms/ml) and in none (p less than 0.001) of the captopril-treated hearts (80 micrograms/ml) did ventricular fibrillation occur. A massive purine overflow was observed in untreated hearts upon reperfusion. This overflow was significantly reduced by captopril and HOE 498, whereas enalapril and prodrug HOE 498 had no significant effect. Concomitantly, the pressure-rate index was severely impaired after 30 min of reperfusion in the untreated, enalapril, and prodrug HOE 498 groups (33 +/- 9, 52 +/- 11, and 48 +/- 12% of initial values, respectively), but captopril and HOE 498 significantly reduced the impairment of mechanical function (124 +/- 9% and 98 +/- 9%, respectively). In contrast to enalapril and prodrug HOE 498, captopril and HOE 498 markedly reduced noradrenaline overflow during the first minutes of reperfusion. No angiotensin II was detectable in the coronary effluent of untreated hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "119": "There remains controversy over the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on renal function in patients with heart failure. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of long-term captopril therapy on renal function in 14 patients with congestive heart failure in a double-blind fashion. Creatinine clearance declined (from 61 +/- 21 to 56 +/- 21 ml/min; p less than 0.01), and both serum urea and creatinine rose. Glomerular filtration rate estimated radioisotopically also fell (from 53 +/- 19 to 48 +/- 18 ml/min), although this was not statistically significant. Effective renal plasma flow estimated radioisotopically increased (from 241 +/- 72 to 287 +/- 100 ml/min; p less than 0.05). Thus, filtration fraction--the ratio of glomerular filtration rate to effective renal plasma flow--fell. Because blood pressure also fell, the rise in renal plasma flow indicates a fall in calculated renal vascular resistance. Whole body sodium and chlorine, measured by total body in vivo neutron activation analysis, were unchanged, indicating no long-term natriuresis, despite evidence of clinical improvement. While converting enzyme inhibition causes symptomatic improvement in cardiac failure, there is a concomitant loss of compensatory direct effects of angiotensin II within the kidney, and hence usually some decline in renal function.", 
    "120": "Chronic administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril to sodium-restricted rats causes azotemia and elevations in serum creatinine. This study was undertaken to determine the contribution of altered systemic and renal hemodynamics to the reductions in renal function in sodium-restricted rats treated with enalapril. Animals were maintained for 21 days on a sodium-restricted diet (0.04 +/- 0.01 mEq Na+/24 h). Enalapril was administered in the drinking water (300 mg/L) to half the rats. Regional blood flows were measured in animals anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) using the radioactive microsphere technique. Converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) reduced mean arterial pressure (130.8 +/- 5.9 vs 60.3 +/- 6.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), and increased cardiac index (346 +/- 33 vs. 437 +/- 28 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.05). Total peripheral resistance was significantly lower in enalapril-treated rats [0.406 +/- 0.049 vs. 0.166 +/- 0.013 arbitrary resistance units (RU), p less than 0.001]. Renal blood flow was maintained (control, 2.93 +/- 0.21 vs. enalapril, 2.55 +/- 0.28 ml/min/100 g, p = NS) despite a 54% decrease in perfusion pressure due to decreased renal vascular resistance (42.6 +/- 1.7 vs. 25.2 +/- 2.9 RU, p less than 0.001). CEI reduced coronary blood flow (2.76 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.59 +/- 0.19 ml/min/100 g, p less than 0.001), but did not change coronary vascular resistance (50.2 +/- 4.6 vs. 44.0 +/- 4.3 RU, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

During electrical stimulation of ventral roots L7 and S1, we compared the cardiovascular responses to hindlimb contraction before and after the following interventions: inhibition of converting enzyme (kininase II) with captopril (3-4 mg/kg, n = 6); inhibition of kallikrein activity with aprotinin (Trasylol, 20,000-30,000 KIU/kg, n = 8); and injection of carboxypeptidase B (500-750 U/kg, n = 7). Treatment with captopril augmented the rise in mean arterial blood pressure and maximal time derivative of pressure (dP/dt) caused by static contraction from 21 +/- 3 to 39 +/- 7 mmHg and 1,405 +/- 362 to 2,285 +/- 564 mmHg/s, respectively. Aprotinin attenuated the contraction-induced rise in mean arterial blood pressure (28 +/- 4 to 9 +/- 2 mmHg) and maximal dP/dt (1,284 +/- 261 to 469 +/- 158 mmHg/s). Carboxypeptidase B reduced the cardiovascular response to static contraction. Thus the mean arterial blood pressure response was decreased from 36 +/- 12 to 24 +/- 11 mmHg, maximal dP/dt from 1,618 +/- 652 to 957 +/- 392 mmHg/s, and heart rate from 12 +/- 2 to 7 +/- 1 beats/min. These data suggest that stimulation of muscle afferents by bradykinin contributes to a portion of the reflex cardiovascular response to static contraction.", 
    "122": "The interaction between bleomycin (BLM) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from bovine lungs, serum, and cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells was examined. ACE activity from all sources was inhibited by metal-free BLM but not by metal-complexed BLM. The metal-free deamide metabolite of BLM, which is nontoxic, also inhibited ACE activity from bovine endothelial cell homogenates and serum. Incubation of intact cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells for 1 h with metal-free BLM produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of cellular ACE activity, which was persistent, lasting at least 24 h after drug removal. In addition, the enzyme activity released into the culture medium was decreased. The inhibition of cellular ACE activity occurred in the absence of (1) cell death as measured by dye exclusion, (2) inhibition of total protein synthesis as measured by [3H]leucine incorporation, and (3) decreased cellular enzyme content as assayed using a monoclonal antibody against the enzyme. These results indicate that a brief exposure of intact cultured pulmonary endothelial cells to BLM can produce direct and prolonged inhibition of ACE activity. The inhibition of ACE activity does not relate directly to cell death but rather appears to result from metal chelation by BLM.", 
    "123": "We conducted a multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial among 626 men with mild to moderate hypertension to determine the effects of captopril, methyldopa, and propranolol on their quality of life. Hydrochlorothiazide was added if needed to control blood pressure. After a 24-week treatment period, all three groups had similar blood-pressure control, although fewer patients taking propranolol required hydrochlorothiazide. Patients taking captopril alone or in combination with a diuretic were least likely to withdraw from treatment because of adverse effects (8 percent vs. 20 percent for methyldopa and 13 percent for propranolol). The treatment groups were similar in scores for sleep dysfunction, visual memory, and social participation. However, patients taking captopril, as compared with patients taking methyldopa, scored significantly higher (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.01) on measures of general well-being, had fewer side effects, and had better scores for work performance, visual-motor functioning, and measures of life satisfaction. Patients taking propranolol also reported better work performance than patients taking methyldopa. Patients taking captopril reported fewer side effects and less sexual dysfunction than those taking propranolol and had greater improvement (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.01) on measures of general well-being. Our findings show that antihypertensive agents have different effects on the quality of life and that these can be meaningfully assessed with available psychosocial measures.",

After a 2-week period on placebo, 5 mg ramipril was administered once daily for 2 weeks. Blood pressure returned to normal in five patients and decreased in the remaining patients, without significant changes in heart rate or orthostatic hypotension. A fall in blood pressure was apparent within 1-2 h of the first dose; the maximum decrease was reached at 4-6 h and a fall in pressure was still detectable after 24 h. At 24 h post dose angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was suppressed to 40% of the baseline. Blood pressures for the 10 h interval post dosing showed smooth through-the-day control with minimal peak/trough difference in lowering effect. The magnitude of the blood pressure decrement achieved with the inhibitor did not correlate with baseline renin levels or the rise in renin following treatment. No side-effects were noted during the 2-week observation period. The study demonstrates that ramipril, given in a once-daily regimen over a period of 2 weeks, is well tolerated and provides smooth and effective blood pressure control throughout the 24-h interval between doses.",

The end point viz. supine diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less was reached in 6 out of 18 patients with captopril alone and in another 4 patients after the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg to 50 mg daily). In 4 more patients, a good response was observed but the end point was not reached. The response was fair in 1 and poor in 3 remaining patients.

    "128": "The present studies were designed to evaluate the physiological significance of angiotensin II in the control of vasopressin secretion in conscious dogs. They demonstrated that exogenous angiotensin II (10 ng/kg per min) increased vasopressin secretion more when the pressor effect of angiotensin II was abolished. The fact that endogenous angiotensin II levels are normally increased without an increase in arterial pressure suggests that angiotensin II may play a greater role in the control of vasopressin secretion than was previously thought. The present study also evaluated the role of endogenous angiotensin II in the control of vasopressin secretion during sodium depletion, a state in which angiotensin II levels are elevated. Intracarotid infusion of a low dose of the angiotensin II antagonist, saralasin, decreased plasma vasopressin concentration, suggesting that endogenous angiotensin II acts in an area of the brain perfused by the carotid arteries to stimulate vasopressin secretion in sodium-deprived dogs. Finally, the present experiments evaluated the role of angiotensin II in baroreceptor reflex control of vasopressin secretion. Baroreflex function was assessed by examining the relationship between the change in blood pressure and the log of the change in vasopressin secretion over a range of blood pressure levels. Exogenous angiotensin II (10 ng/kg per min) altered baroreflex function by causing a shift of this relationship to a higher pressure level in sodium-replete dogs. In sodium-depleted dogs, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with saralasin or captopril produced an opposite shift. These results suggest that endogenous angiotensin II may be necessary for the maintenance of normal baroreflex control of vasopressin secretion during sodium depletion. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that endogenous angiotensin II plays a role in the control of vasopressin secretion.", 
    "129": "Using captopril (C), an angiotensin (ANG) I converting-enzyme inhibitor, to increase endogenous prostaglandins (PGs) and to decrease endogenous ANG II synthesis, we studied the relationship between endogenous ANG II, PG, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release in seven normal volunteers before (control study) and after inhibition of PG synthesis by a single dose of aspirin (ASA study). In the control study, following the administration of 100 mg of C, there was a significant increase of plasma PGE2, plasma-renin activity (PRA), and urinary PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and a decrease of plasma ADH. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were unaffected by C; urine output, fractional sodium excretion (FENa), and osmolal clearance (Cosmol) increased; and urinary osmolality (Uosmol) decreased significantly after C. In the ASA study PG were undetectable in plasma and significantly reduced in urine 1 h after aspirin and did not increase when C was added. Plasma ADH decreased and PRA increased, as in the control study, after C, whereas GFR, RPF, urine output, FENa, Cosmol, and Uosmol were unchanged. These results suggest that the effect of C on ADH release may be mediated, to a large extent, by a fall in endogenous circulating ANG II, since ADH decreased in the presence of both high or undetectable levels of PGE2. The results also suggest that the increase in PGE2 induced by C may precipitate the diuretic and natriuretic effects of acute C administration.", 
    "130": "Short- and long-term hemodynamic and clinical responses to sequential therapy with prazosin (15 mg/day for 3 to 12 weeks) and captopril (75 to 300 mg/day for 2 to 15 weeks) were compared in 22 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure. First doses of prazosin produced marked increases in cardiac index and stroke volume index (p less than 0.01), but these effects were lost during long-term treatment. First doses of captopril produced only modest increases in both variables, but these persisted without attenuation during prolonged therapy. Both drugs produced immediate decreases in left ventricular filling pressure, mean arterial pressure, mean right atrial pressure and systemic vascular resistance; these changes became significantly attenuated (p less than 0.01) with prazosin but not with captopril. At the end of treatment, stroke volume index was significantly higher and right and left ventricular filling pressures were significantly lower with captopril than with prazosin (p less than 0.05 to 0.01). Only 8 of the 22 patients (36%) treated with prazosin benefited clinically, whereas 14 of 19 patients (74%) treated with captopril felt that they had improved (p less than 0.05). These differences could not have been predicted by comparing responses to first doses of the 2 drugs. These findings indicate that the choice of 1 vasodilator drug over another in patients with congestive heart failure should be based on studies that compare their long-term rather than short-term hemodynamic and clinical effects.", 
    "131": "The activation of the renin angiotensin system is thought to be an important factor contributing to hypertension following kidney transplantation (TX). We studied 21 hypertensive renal transplant recipients, without evidence of acute graft rejection or transplant artery stenosis, 6 to 60 months post-TX. The acute responses of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal hemodynamics (ERPF: effective renal plasma flow, 131I-Hippuran clearance) and function (GFR: glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance; UNaV: urinary sodium excretion rate) to converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) by captopril were assessed. CEI induced a decrease in MAP (118 +/- 2 to 110 +/- 2 mmHg), renal resistance (RR: 0.27 +/- 0.02 to 0.21 +/- 0.01) and filtration fraction (FF: 0.31 +/- 0.02 to 0.23 +/- 0.01). ERPF (307 +/- 24 to 333 +/- 18 ml/min/1.73 m2) and GFR (88 +/- 5 to 78 +/- 5 ml/min/1.73 m2) were not significantly changed. UNaV increased by 53 +/- 24 mumol/min. Changes in MAP (r = -0.66), ERPF (r = 0.74) and FF (r = -0.88) were significantly correlated with the log of control plasma renin activity (PRA). In 10 patients with an increase of ERPF (range: + 30 to + 70%) and no change in GFR, the activated renin system could originate from the recipient's own kidneys. In the remaining 11 patients, CEI was associated with no increase in ERPF (change: + 2 to - 27%) and a fall in GFR, a response suggesting a possible intrarenal vascular damage. These results indicate that RAS participates in the regulation of systemic and renal vascular tone, with a possible predominant effect on efferent glomerular arteriole.", 
    "132": "The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may lead to reversible renal insufficiency in transplant patients with transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS). We assessed acute effects of captopril (50 mg, p. os) in 7 cadaver kidney recipients (mean age: 35.6 +/- 4 yrs) with TRAS, 9 to 46 mo after transplantation. All patients were treated by prednisolone and azathioprine. After captopril administration, mean arterial pressure decreased from 127 +/- 6 to 119 +/- 7 mmHg, effective renal plasma flow from 152 +/- 19 to 118 +/- 19 ml/min/1.73 m2, glomerular filtration rate from 59 +/- 8 to 39 +/- 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 and filtration fraction from 0.39 +/- 0.02 to 0.32 +/- 0.07. Among the 7 patients, 2 developed immediate and transient anuria; 4 presented a net decrease of GFR, only one had stable GFR. This patient was chronically treated by captopril; as BP was not controlled, furosemide (40 mg p. os) was added. Serum creatinine increased from 180 to 250 mumol/l. Percutaneous angioplasty was done without decrease in BP; however, treatment by captopril and furosemide could be reinstitued without deterioration in renal function. We conclude that: acute renal failure in kidney graft recipients with TRAS is frequent, but not mandatory; sodium depletion induced by diuretics enhances the fall in GFR; acute effect of captopril must be assessed in patients with TRAS before the use of this product as long term antihypertensive treatment.",

All these patients presented significant stenosis (greater than 60%) of the artery of a transplanted kidney (5), of a single kidney (1) or a bilateral renal artery stenosis (1). During the following three days, 50 mg captopril was given twice a day. ARF with creatinine serum level higher than 300 mumoles/l was seen in 4 patients (Group II); in 3 patients (Group I) creatinine serum level didn't change. Values measured before the single dose of captopril and variations after three hours are reported in the table: (Table: see text). Before captopril, in Group II CPAH and CIn are lower and GFF is higher, but these is not significant difference between the two groups. After Captopril CIn and GFF are significantly decreased in Group II (29.1 and 36.6% vs 7.8 and 10%).

Dipeptide derivatives with the BNMA group at the N-terminal (BNMA-Val-Sta-isoleucinol [ES-313], BNMA-Leu-Sta-isoleucinol [ES-316], and BNMA-Nle-Sta-isoleucinol [ES-317]) had potencies against human renin that were similar to the potency of ES-305. All these dipeptide derivatives competitively inhibited human renin. The inhibitors were also potent against monkey renin but were less effective against renins from pig, goat, dog, rabbit, and rat. ES-305 had little effect on cathepsin D and pepsin at the concentration of 10(-5) M. The other derivatives showed detectable inhibition of cathepsin D (IC50, 10(-6) - 10(-7) M) and pepsin (10(-5) - 10(-6) M). All the compounds had little or no effect on trypsin, chymotrypsin, angiotensin converting enzyme, and urinary kallikrein at the concentration of 10(-5) M.

These diacid compounds were more active than enalaprilic acid or captopril. In stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) chronic oral treatment for two weeks with enalapril (30 mg/kg per day), ramipril or perindopril (each 1 mg/kg per day) normalized blood pressure. The CE inhibitor-induced changes in parameters of the plasma renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin I, angiotensin II, PRC, CE activity) followed the expected pattern, but were not quantitatively related to the antihypertensive action of the three inhibitors. Four weeks of oral equi-dose treatment with the three CE inhibitors (10 mg/kg per day) inhibited tissue CE activity in various organs including kidney, heart, vascular wall and brain. Ramipril and perindopril lowered blood pressure and tissue CE activity more potently than enalapril. These results confirm the hypothesis that CE inhibition in tissue with subsequent local reduction of ANG II synthesis may contribute to the antihypertensive mechanisms of CE inhibitors.",

Finally, during the ten first hours following drug intake, there was a significant correlation between perindopril-induced PCEA inhibition and brachial artery flow increase.", 
    "139": "Inhibition of cardiac adenylate cyclase by adenosine receptor agonists was reinvestigated in a more homogeneous sarcolemmal vesicular preparation than used in a previous study. Microsomal particles obtained by differential centrifugation were further fractionated on a shallow density gradient of Percoll. Two populations of plasma membrane vesicles were partially resolved. Identical peaks were identified for adenylate cyclase activity and [3H]ouabain binding, whereas 5'-nucleotidase activity and beta-adrenoceptor binding displayed an additional peak at higher density, where angiotensin converting enzyme, a marker for endothelial plasma membranes, was at maximal activity. Significant inhibition by N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), as measured in each fractionation step following homogenization, was observed only at the activity peak of adenylate cyclase. Moreover, analysis of the degree and rank order of potency of several adenosine analogs was indicative for interaction with A1-adenosine receptors. Accordingly, the peak in adenosine receptor binding, using (-)[125I]iodo-N6-hydroxyphenyl-isopropyladenosine as the radioligand, coincided with CHA-inhibitable adenylate cyclase activity. By contrast, adenylate cyclase was slightly stimulated by CHA in the higher density range, an action suggested to be mediated via A2-adenosine receptors, which recently have been demonstrated to exist on guinea-pig coronary endothelium. It is concluded that the full extent of adenosine receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase inhibition in the heart is only to be demonstrated if contamination of the sarcolemmal preparation with endothelial membrane components is kept to a minimum.", 
    "140": "A randomized single-blind study was designed to compare the performance on memory tests requiring recall of information relevant to everyday life of two groups of hypertensive patients. One group of 13 patients were taking a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (atenolol) and the other group of 12 patients received the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). The results suggested that when compared with placebo the group of patients treated with enalapril showed no changes in memory function, whilst there was a mild, but consistent deficit in the group taking atenolol.", 
    "141": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, was studied in a cryo-injury model of chronic heart failure. This model is characterized by a progressive decrease in cardiac output starting six weeks after cryo-injury to a 30% decrease in cardiac output 10 weeks after injury. Although histological damage to the myocardial tissue, particularly in the epicardial area, was observed, no significant changes occurred in body weight, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate or central venous pressure. Daily intraperitoneal injection of 3 mg/kg lisinopril was instituted starting four weeks after injury for a duration of six weeks. Lisinopril completely restored the cardiac output to normal values at the end of this six week period. Thus, converting enzyme inhibition appears to be an effective therapeutic agent in this model of chronic cardiac failure.", 
    "142": "Using chromatofocusing, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) has been isolated from human lung. The procedure allows for 24 300-fold purification of the enzyme. The enzyme specific activity is 36.3 u. per mg protein; Mr as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is 150 000. The lung enzyme after solubilization by trypsin treatment was found to be heterogeneous. Four isoforms of the enzyme with pI 5.3, 4.9, 4.8 and 4.6 were identified. The pH-optimum for the enzyme with respect to hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine hydrolysis lies at 8.3; Km = 2.8 mM. The effect of Cl- on the enzyme activity was studied. It was found that the bradykinin-potentiating factor (SQ 20 881) inhibits the human lung angiotensin-converting enzyme (I50 = 1.6 X 10(-8) M).", 
    "143": "In a double-blind crossover study, 13 patients with pretreatment diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 109 mm Hg received nadolol, 80 mg/day, plus placebo of hydrochlorothiazide and nadolol, plus three different doses of active hydrochlorothiazide. Patients remained on each active regimen for 3 weeks, with an intervening placebo period of 2 to 4 weeks. With 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily plus nadolol, there was no greater reduction of blood pressure than with nadolol alone. A dose of 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was associated with a significantly greater decrease in systolic but not diastolic pressure, as compared with nadolol alone. A significantly greater reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was obtained only with the 50 mg/day dose of hydrochlorothiazide. Extension to 6 weeks of treatment with 12.5 mg/day failed to lower the blood pressure more than the level seen at 3 weeks. These results suggest that in combination with nadolol, 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day has no significant antihypertensive effect. There was no evidence of a flat dose-response curve in the daily dose range of 12.5 to 50 mg. For most patients, a dose of 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was required to lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly below the level obtained with nadolol alone.", 
    "144": "We conducted these experiments to evaluate the selectivity of calcium channel blockade on the renal autoregulatory mechanism and on angiotensin II-mediated renal vasoconstriction. Experiments were performed in anesthetized dogs in which renal arterial pressure, renal blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate were measured at normal and reduced renal arterial pressure. At control arterial pressures, renal arterial infusions of verapamil increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate significantly. The decreases in renal vascular resistance elicited with verapamil (n = 13) and nifedipine (n = 4) occurred only at renal arterial pressure levels within the normal autoregulatory range. Renal blood flow autoregulatory efficiency was markedly attenuated, and the pressure-flow relationship obtained during calcium channel blockade approached that of a passive system. Systemic infusions of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) during continued verapamil infusion caused further vasodilation at all renal arterial pressure values, as evidenced by an increase in slope of 27% of the pressure-blood flow relationship. This response was reversed by angiotensin II infusions. This shift indicates a reduction in minimal vascular resistance elicited by captopril, not obtainable with verapamil alone, and sensitive to angiotensin II. The effects of verapamil and nifedipine on renal blood flow autoregulation suggest a specific effect at preglomerular sites of potential operated membrane calcium channels in the autoregulatory phenomenon. The additional vasodilation elicited with captopril and reversed by angiotensin II indicates the presence of an angiotensin-sensitive postglomerular resistance component which is not influenced by calcium entry blockers.", 
    "145": "The present studies were designed to examine the effect of angiotensin II on baroreflex control of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion and heart rate in conscious dogs. Baroreflex function was assessed by examining the relationship between blood pressure and plasma corticosteroid concentration (used as an index of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion) and between blood pressure and pulse interval (the inverse of heart rate). Blood pressure was varied by intravenous infusion of four doses (0.3, 0.6, 1.5, and 3.0 micrograms/kg per min) of the vasodilator nitroprusside. Nitroprusside infusion produced an increase in plasma corticosteroid concentration and a decrease in pulse interval, both of which were linearly related to the fall in arterial blood pressure. During infusion of angiotensin II (10 ng/kg per min), however, the lines relating blood pressure to plasma corticosteroid concentration or blood pressure to pulse interval were shifted to a higher pressure level, suggesting that angiotensin II resets the baroreceptor reflex. Angiotensin II blockade with saralasin, an angiotensin II antagonist, or with captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, in sodium-depleted dogs with elevated plasma angiotensin II levels produced a shift in the opposite direction in these relationships. Because baroreflex function in sodium-depleted dogs before angiotensin II blockade was similar to that in sodium-replete dogs, despite the increased plasma angiotensin II levels, and because treatment of sodium-replete dogs with saralasin did not affect baroreflex function, these results suggest that endogenous angiotensin II is necessary for the maintenance of normal baroreflex control of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion and heart rate during sodium depletion. Previous studies designed to evaluate the physiological significance of angiotensin II in the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion showed that high, perhaps supraphysiological, levels of exogenous angiotensin II are required to increase adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. An additional finding of the present study was that exogenous angiotensin II produces a larger increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion when the pressor effect of angiotensin II was eliminated with simultaneous infusion of the vasodilators nitroprusside or hydralazine. This result suggests that experiments that evaluate the physiological role of angiotensin II in the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion with infusions of exogenous AII may underestimate the importance of endogenously produced angiotensin II, which is normally released without an increase in pressure.", 
    "146": "A patient with congestive heart failure and moderate renal insufficiency developed severe reversible non-oliguric renal failure while on frusemide and enalapril. Renal failure developed when enalapril was given in the presence of pronounced sodium depletion. When positive sodium balance was restored the plasma creatinine concentration began to fall while angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition remained effective and blood pressure was stable. These observations suggest that the degree of sodium depletion plays an important role in the tendency for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to induce renal failure in patients with congestive heart failure and moderate renal insufficiency. Restoration of a positive sodium balance promotes the recovery of renal function after the combined administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics.", 
    "147": "Earlier experiments have shown that in sodium depleted hypertensive rats with bilaterally constricted renal arteries the arterial pressure normalized after blockade of the renin-angiotensin system; simultaneously acute renal failure occurred. In hypertensive rats with unilateral renal artery stenosis an impaired excretory function of the clipped kidney can be expected, but may not be detectable by conventional tests of renal function. Male Wistar rats with chronic two kidney, one clip hypertension were fed a low sodium diet. After 7 days the rats were treated with vehicle, with the vasodilator dihydralazine, or with the angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor MK 421 for 2 weeks. During the 14-day treatment period a continuous blood pressure reduction was achieved in dihydralazine and MK 421 treated rats. Overall excretory kidney function (plasma creatinine concentration) was well maintained in all three groups until the end of the antihypertensive drug treatment. At the end of drug therapy mean glomerular filtration rates of the left clipped kidneys were significantly lower in both treated groups compared to hypertensive controls, and mean glomerular filtration rate of the left clipped kidneys of dihydralazine treated rats was significantly higher than in MK 421 treated rats: controls (N = 6) 1.03 +/- 0.03, dihydralazine-group (N = 10) 0.28 +/- 0.07, MK 421-group (N = 9) 0.03 +/- 0.01 ml/min. Renal blood flows were comparable in both treated groups. Only the left kidneys of rats treated with MK 421 showed a prominent tubular atrophy. Seven days after declipping of the left renal artery and right nephrectomy a considerable restitution of the tubular structure had occurred in the MK 421-group. The recovery of tubular epithelial cells was paralleled by a rise in glomerular filtration rate: MK 421 group (N = 7) 1.25 +/- 0.08 ml/min. Thus, the clipped kidney in two kidney, one clip hypertensive rats showed functional and morphological signs of impairment when systemic arterial pressure was reduced to the normal range. The alterations of the clipped kidney were most pronounced in rats with renin-angiotensin system-blockade.", 
    "148": "Micropuncture and morphologic studies were performed in six groups of male Munich-Wistar rats after removal of the right kidney and segmental infarction of two-thirds of the left kidney. Groups 1 and 4 received no specific therapy. Groups 2 and 5 were treated with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, 50 mg/liter, in the drinking water. Groups 3 and 6 were treated with reserpine (5 mg/liter), hydralazine (80 mg/liter), and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/liter). All rats were fed standard chow. Groups 1-3 underwent micropuncture study 4 wk after renal ablation. Untreated group 1 rats exhibited systemic hypertension and elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) due to high average values for the mean glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient (delta P) and glomerular plasma flow rate (QA). In group 2 rats, treatment with enalapril prevented systemic hypertension and maintained delta P at near-normal levels without significant reduction in SNGFR and QA. In contrast, triple drug therapy normalized systemic hypertension, but failed to lower delta P in group 3 rats. Groups 4-6 were followed for 12 wk after renal ablation. Untreated group 4 rats demonstrated continuous systemic hypertension, progressive proteinuria, and glomerular structural lesions, including mesangial expansion and frequent areas of segmental sclerosis. In group 5 rats, treatment with enalapril maintained systemic blood pressure at normal levels over the 12-wk period and dramatically limited the development of proteinuria and glomerular lesions. Despite equivalent systemic blood pressure control in group 6 rats, failure of triple drug therapy to control glomerular hypertension was associated with progressive proteinuria and glomerular lesions comparable to those seen in untreated group 4 rats. Thus, unless glomerular capillary hypertension is corrected, control of systemic blood pressure is insufficient to prevent progressive renal injury in rats with reduced renal mass.", 
    "149": "Two groups of adult male Munich-Wistar rats and a third group of nondiabetic age-matched and weight-matched normal control rats underwent micropuncture study 1 mo, and morphologic studies 14 mo, after induction of streptozotocin diabetes or sham treatment. All animals were fed standard rat chow. Diabetic rats received daily ultralente insulin to maintain stable moderate hyperglycemia (approximately 350 mg/dl). In addition, one group of diabetic rats was treated with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, 15 mg/liter of drinking water. Average kidney weight, whole kidney and single-nephron glomerular filtration rate, and glomerular plasma flow rate were elevated to similar values in both groups of diabetic rats, relative to normal control rats. Non-enalapril-treated diabetic rats exhibited significant elevations in mean glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure and transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient, compared with the other groups studied, and only this group eventually developed marked and progressive albuminuria. Likewise, histological examination of the kidneys at 14 mo disclosed a high incidence of glomerular structural abnormalities only in non-enalapril-treated diabetic rats. These findings indicate that prevention of glomerular capillary hypertension in rats with diabetes mellitus effectively protects against the subsequent development of glomerular structural injury and proteinuria. This protection is afforded despite pronounced hyperglycemia and elevated levels of glucosylated hemoglobin, further supporting our view that hemodynamic rather than metabolic factors predominate in the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerulopathy.", 
    "150": "Combining high-performance liquid chromatography with radioimmunoassay enabled the precise measurement of different angiotensins and their metabolites in plasma. Peptides were extracted from 2 ml of plasma by reversible adsorption to phenylsilyl-silica, separated by isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography, and quantitated by radioimmunoassay using a sensitive but suitably cross-reacting angiotensin II antiserum. For the C-terminal angiotensin II metabolites (2-8)heptapeptide, (3-8)hexapeptide, and (4-8)pentapeptide, overall recoveries of 10 fmol peptide added to 1 ml of plasma were (mean +/- SD), 74 +/- 6, 68 +/- 8, and 67 +/- 11%, respectively. The detection limit for these peptides in plasma was 0.2 fmol/ml. Blanks were below the detection limits. In eight seated normal subjects treated for 4 days with enalapril, 20 mg p.o., q.d., angiotensin II metabolites tended to decrease during the 4 postdrug hours. However, their cumulated concentration in relation to octapeptide increased from 54 to 163% on Day 1 and from 62 to 103% on Day 4. After 4 hours of converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril there was still a close correlation between plasma renin activity and angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide level (r = 0.83, p less than 0.05) and between blood angiotensin I and angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide levels (r = 0.86, p less than 0.01). Adding angiotensin I in vitro raised the angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide levels after incubation at 4 degrees C for 4 hours. Thus, immunoreactive \"angiotensin II\" does not disappear after converting enzyme inhibition largely because of the cumulated contribution of cross-reacting metabolites and partly because of in vitro generation of true angiotensin II.", 
    "151": "The changes in active and inactive renin after captopril (n = 29) or furosemide administration (n = 10) were studied in hypertensive patients. Furthermore, after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in 3 cases of renovascular hypertension (RVH), and after nephrectomy in a case of juxtaglomerular cell tumor, the time course of the changes in these two types of renin was investigated. Inactive renin was activated by trypsin treatment. Plasma renin concentration was measured by using an excess of sheep substrate. In patients with essential hypertension or primary aldosteronism, inactive renin was unchanged, irrespective of response in active renin, after the administration of captopril and furosemide. In patients with RVH, inactive renin was markedly decreased by furosemide but unchanged by captopril, in spite of significant increase in active renin. After PTA and nephrectomy, inactive renin decreased slower than active renin. These data support the idea that in patients with RVH, the increase in active renin by furosemide is at least partly due to the activation of inactive renin. It is also suggested that the increase in active renin by captopril is mainly due to the promoted release of active renin from the kidney. Furthermore, it seems likely that the metabolic clearance of inactive renin is slower than that in active renin.", 
    "152": "Natriuresis induced by infusions of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in water-loaded rats typically occurred in time sequences ('peak-and-shoulder' patterns) with an overlap of two different natriuretic responses. The first response was abrupt, short-lived and potentiated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. The second response was a gradual onset of natriuresis which lasted only as long as the ANF infusion and was directly correlated to the level of arterial blood pressure. This phenomenon explains the apparent loss of responsiveness to ANF bolus injections during a late phase. Atrial natriuretic factor facilitated excretion of intravenous salt loads, and the effect was also observed with low salt doses (1 microgram/h) which were below threshold for natriuresis when given alone. The data available so far suggest that ANF, apart from its effect on collecting-duct permeability, interferes with several control and feedback systems involved in sodium input into the collecting-duct system.", 
    "153": "The drug therapy of decompensated cardiac insufficiency in dilated cardiomyopathies is based, still today, on the association of digitalis and diuretics, even though doubts had been expressed about the long term efficacy of glycosides. In the search for an ideal inotropic agent, several molecules recently synthesized are being investigated. The results obtained are not entirely satisfactory, either because the functional advantage is finally exhausted, or because of the frequency of side effects. Among the vasodilators, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme give better results by producing a substantial and lasting improvement of the ventricle performance, without tachyphylaxis or sympathetic compensation phenomenon. In some patients,the use of Beta-blockers could be beneficial, but the definitive proof is not yet furnished and the results are inconsistent.", 
    "154": "The intravenous 133Xenon method was used to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 20 patients with moderate hypertension. Regional cerebral blood flow under pretreatment, in the placebo period and after 8 weeks of enalapril treatment were compared. The rCBF values [(F1), and initial slope, (IS)] showed no statistical difference during the three periods in spite of significantly higher blood pressure values in the placebo period. It is concluded, that with enalapril good blood pressure control is achieved without any adverse effect on rCBF.", 
    "155": "The epidemiology and etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) are reviewed. CHF affects as many as 4 million Americans and is one of the most prevalent causes of death in hospitalized patients. Major risk factors for developing CHF include advanced age, male sex, hypertension, coronary artery disease, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatic heart disease. Heart failure results from decreased intrinsic myocardial contractility caused by one or more of three changes: (1) altered adrenergic nervous system function, (2) impaired delivery of calcium to contractile elements in the heart, and (3) reduced myosin-ATPase activity in the myocardium. The disease is progressive, and no intervention has yet been found to stop it effectively. CHF is diagnosed based on subjective signs and symptoms and objective assessment using auscultation, ECG, chest roentgenogram, laboratory tests, and noninvasive and invasive tests. Treatment of CHF begins with restriction of physical activity and sodium intake. Pharmacologic interventions start with either digitalis glycosides or thiazide diuretics; both may be used concomitantly as the disease progresses. Current studies are focusing on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as first-line agents for CHF. When CHF worsens, loop diuretics are substituted for or added to the thiazide diuretics, and vasodilators are added to reduce the workload on the heart. Other inotropic agents, including the new bipyridine derivatives, may also be used. In patients not responding to these and other aggressive therapeutic interventions, cardiac transplantation is the only option. Despite advances in management of CHF, little improvement in overall survival has been demonstrated, and no intervention has stopped or reversed the progression of CHF.", 
    "156": "To investigate the possible role of arginine vasopressin in maintaining high blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the effect of two arginine vasopressin pressor antagonists on mean arterial pressure and the pressor responsiveness to exogenous arginine vasopressin were studied in conscious, freely moving SHR and in Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Intravenous injections of either d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)arginine vasopressin, 10 micrograms/kg, or dPTyr(Me)arginine vasopressin, 20 micrograms/kg, had no effect on mean arterial pressure or heart rate of normohydrated SHR, although both antagonists almost completely abolished the pressor response to exogenous arginine vasopressin. Furthermore, dPTyr(Me)arginine vasopressin was ineffective in eliciting a depressor response, even after 24 or 48 hours of water deprivation. During converting enzyme inhibition with SQ 20881, mean arterial pressure and heart rate remained unchanged following arginine vasopressin blockade in both normohydrated and fluid-restricted animals. alpha-Adrenergic receptor blockade reduced the blood pressure of normohydrated SHR, from 160 +/- 7 to 81 +/- 8 mm Hg. When dPTyr(Me)arginine vasopressin was given during alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade there was a small, transient fall in mean arterial pressure. The pressor responsiveness to exogenous arginine vasopressin was similar in hypertensive and normotensive rats. These results suggest that arginine vasopressin does not function as an important pressor hormone in conscious SHR.", 
    "157": "A 49-year-old Japanese man presented with chronic granulomatous uveitis in his left eye. Later he developed macular subretinal neovascularisation. The chest x-ray showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopy and gallium-67 scanning were positive, PPD skin test negative, and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels increased. Ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed perivasculitis, retinochoroidal exudates, snow banking, and vitreous opacity. On these findings, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. Treatment was based on topical corticosteroids, mydriatics, beta blockers, and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. After 15 months the visual acuity decreased in the left eye, and a neovascular membrane was observed in the macula. Fluorescein angiography confirmed subretinal neovascularisation. Almost two years later the patient still has the neovascular membrane in his left eye.", 
    "158": "Pretreatment of dogs with s.c. isoproterenol (10 micrograms/kg) caused a significant increase in drinking when 100 ng renin substrate was administered 3 min later to the lateral cerebral ventricles or subfornical organ. Isoproterenol itself was a potent peripheral (10 micrograms/kg), but unreliable central (0.01-1 microgram) dipsogen. The increased drinking after combined s.c. isoproterenol and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) renin substrate injections was significantly attenuated by i.c.v. captopril (20 micrograms), but was not influenced by s.c. captopril (500 micrograms/kg). However, combined i.c.v./s.c. pretreatment with captopril nearly abolished drinking to peripheral isoproterenol, or the combination of s.c. isoproterenol and i.c.v. renin substrate. Finally, single intracranial injections of the components of the renin-angiotensin system elicited dose-dependent and site-specific drinking. Renin substrate, angiotensin I and angiotensin III produced greater intakes at forebrain tissue sites than after i.c.v. or subfornical organ injections. Renin, on the other hand, was more potent i.c.v. than at forebrain loci. These results suggest that the cerebral renin-angiotensin system may participate in beta-adrenergic thirst mechanisms by increasing local angiotensin II biosynthesis in specific areas of the brain.", 
    "159": "Remarkable progress has been made during the past 30 years in the management of hypertension, a disease that affects approximately one out of every four adults in the United States. In the 1960s, at least half of the individuals with hypertension were unaware of their disease, and the blood pressures of fewer than 20 percent were controlled at normotensive levels. In contrast, in the 1980s, only a small percentage, perhaps as few as 10 or 15 percent of hypertensive patients, are unaware of their disease and, in many parts of the country, more than 60 percent are being treated to goal blood pressure levels. More effective treatment of hypertension is probably a major reason for the 45 percent decrease in stroke mortality rates in the last 12 years alone and for the dramatic decrease in the number of hypertensive patients in whom renal failure or congestive heart failure develops. In addition, at least a portion of the 25 to 30 percent decrease in coronary mortality rates can probably be attributed to better management of patients with hypertension. The availability of antihypertensive drugs in the 1950s (rauwolfia preparations, veratrum derivatives, thiocyanates, hydralazine, and the ganglion blockers) and the discovery of more effective agents in the period from the 1960s to the present have dramatically improved the prognosis of hypertensive patients. Thiazide diuretics, centrally acting sympatholytic agents, beta-adrenergic inhibitors, and, more recently, selective alpha-adrenergic inhibitors, converting-enzyme inhibitors, and calcium entry blockers are examples of these medications. All of these agents have some side effects, with varying patient acceptability. The search continues for newer drugs that are well tolerated, that lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance, and that produce few metabolic changes. A detailed review of the physiologic effects of antihypertensive medications, as well as a critique of the clinical trials and some of the problems noted in the pharmacologic management of hypertension, is presented.", 
    "160": "Des-Leu10-angiotensin I is a nonapeptide generated from angiotensin I by the action of carboxypeptidase-like activities residing in the human platelet and mast cell. This nonapeptide was found to inhibit rabbit lung angiotensin-converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) with a Ki of 3.1 X 10(-7) M. The mechanism of inhibition was competitive. Inhibition of human serum angiotensin-converting enzyme by des-Leu10-angiotensin I was comparable in magnitude to inhibition by bradykinin and angiotensin III. These results suggest that limited proteolysis of angiotensin I by cells resident in vascular tissue may result in the generation of an endogenous inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Such pathways may play roles in controlling levels of vasoactive peptides at local vascular sites.", 
    "161": "Numerous drugs have been suggested for the treatment of systemic scleroderma. They may be studied and classified according to their site of action on the chain of events that leads from vascular abnormalities to sclerosis of the skin. Thus, proline analogues, colchicine, lathyrogenic agents, D-penicillamine, coagulation factor XIII and oestrogens are thought to act on collagens and their metabolism. Ketanserin has been suggested by the discovery of tryptophan abnormalities. Corticosteroids exert an inhibitory effect on fibroblasts. The use of calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, prostacyclin and anti-platelets rests on the presence of vascular abnormalities. The purpose of treatments with immunosuppressive drugs or plasma exchanges is to act on possible lymphocytic and/or macropageal factors.", 
    "162": "The effect of captopril and a mixture of captopril and copper on natural killer (NK) activity of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was examined. Preincubation of PBMC with captopril alone did not affect their NK activity at concentrations of 5-50 micrograms/ml. However, in the presence of copper sulfate, captopril inhibited the NK activity in a dose-response fashion. Similar inhibition was observed when adherent depleted fraction was treated with captopril and copper. In the time course study, significant inhibition of NK activity by captopril and copper was already observed at 3 hr preincubation. The inhibition of NK activity by captopril and copper was completely abolished by the addition of catalase, but not by superoxide dismutase, interleukin-2, or indomethacin. Preincubation of PBMC with captopril and copper for 18 hr decreased its viability. This decrease was also reversed in the presence of catalase. These results suggest that immunosuppression by captopril in the presence of copper was mediated by hydrogen peroxide.", 
    "163": "In 16 patients with chronic aortic regurgitation, we studied the acute hormonal and hemodynamic effects of 12.5 to 25 mg captopril; in 12 patients the changes after a 4 to 8 week treatment period (mean 6.3 +/- 2 weeks; doses: 3 times 12.5 to 3 times 25 mg/day) were investigated. The following baseline variables were evaluated: the radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) at rest and during exercise, left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV), regurgitant blood volume (RBV); and plasma renin activity (PRA). Repeated determinations of EF, EDV and RPA were carried out 90 minutes after application of the drug. In patients with chronic therapy, EF at rest and during exercise, EDV, RBV and PRA were reinvestigated at the end of the study. Acute administration of captopril was followed by an increase of EF (from 49 +/- 12 to 55 +/- 12%, p less than 0.001) and a slight decrease of EDV (from 389 +/- 160 to 376 +/- 146 ml, p less than 0.05). PRA significantly increased (from 1.6 to 3.1 ng/ml/h, p less than 0.05). Chronic therapy resulted in a moderate decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (from 156/70 +/- 31/15 to 140/63 +/- 23/15 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). However, no significant changes were observed in EF at rest and during exercise (51 +/- 9 vs. 53 +/- 10% and 45 +/- 14 vs. 47 +/- 14%), EDV (433 +/- 179 vs. 422 +/- 179 ml) and RBV (136 +/- 81 vs. 129 +/- 77 ml). PRA was significantly increased (6.3 ng/ml/h, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "164": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is identical to the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase kininase II, which inactivates bradykinin. That is why captopril, an orally active ACE inhibitor, alters the kallikrein-kinin-arachidonic acid system. It is suggested that this mechanism could be responsible for the dosage-dependent incidence of polymorph cutaneous eruptions during therapy with captopril. A 42-year-old female patient with no previous personal or family history of psoriasis developed an eruptive-exanthematous type of psoriasis vulgaris 1-2 weeks after the beginning of captopril therapy. It is suggested that the onset of the dermatosis was produced by a blockade of bradykinin inactivation. This might have increased the production of arachidonic acid and led to elevated concentrations of inflammatory mediators.", 
    "165": "In the past, hemodynamic factors, in congestive heart failure were considered as being of major importance in the production of the major symptoms and signs of the disease: peripheral (increased oxygen extraction, flow redistribution) or central (Starling's law, myocardial contractility). More recently, excessive hormonal compensation has been felt to be more important such as: The renine-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, Circulating catecholamines, Arginin-vasopressin. These hormones are responsible for water and sodium retention, tachycardia and increase in peripheral resistance. Newer agents such as Captopril are effective in blocking the action of these endocrine factors.", 
    "166": "Six patients maintained on 50-100 mg captopril, for 2-25 months, were administered captopril 50 mg orally, together with either naloxone or 0.9% saline vehicle (placebo) given intravenously, in a double-blind crossover study. Naloxone did not appear to modify the circulatory effects of captopril in these patients, in contrast to earlier findings after acute captopril administration in normotensives. The results do not support an important endogenous opioid role in the chronic antihypertensive effect of captopril, but provide evidence that different mechanisms may contribute to the early short term falls in blood pressure, compared to the later long term effects.", 
    "167": "The effect of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was studied in rats subjected to Escherichia coli pyelonephritis. Eight weeks after pyelonephritis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats, the rats were randomly assigned to treatment groups based on urinary protein excretion. In experiment 1, rats were given captopril, 50 mg/kg of body weight, or saline solution via daily intraperitoneal injection. To eliminate complications with captopril-induced peritonitis, experiment 2 was performed in which rats were given the same treatment by daily gavage. In both experiments, 24-hour urinary protein excretion in the saline-treated rats was significantly greater than that of the captopril-treated rats after 12 weeks of treatment (P less than 0.05). Plasma urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine, and endogenous creatinine clearance did not differ between treatment groups during the course of therapy in experiment 1. There were no differences in these values in experiment 2, except at week 8 of treatment when the captopril-treated rats had significantly lower plasma creatinine and higher endogenous creatinine clearance than did the saline-treated rats (P less than 0.05). There was also no difference between treatment groups in the degree of morphologic renal damage based on light microscopic evaluation of kidneys at the end of treatment.", 
    "168": "As the characteristics of sodium and water balance in heart failure remain undefined, we evaluated the hemodynamic, metabolic, and hormonal effects of balanced sodium intake in 10 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We discontinued diuretics to avoid their confounding influence, and all patients received 1 wk of 10 meq and 100 meq balanced sodium intake and controlled free water. Comparing sodium intake of 10 with 100 meq, the following observations were made. There was weight gain (2.0 kg) and increased sodium excretion (11 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 15 meq/24 h), unaccompanied by increase of blood volume. Both renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system activity were greater during the 10 meq diet, and suppressed with the 100 meq sodium diet. For both diets, plasma renin and urinary aldosterone excretion were correlated with urinary sodium excretion (r = -0.768, r = -0.726, respectively; P less than 0.005). Systemic hemodynamics were minimally changed with increased sodium intake. However, reversal of vasoconstriction by captopril during the 10 meq diet, and its ineffectiveness during the 100 meq diet, indicated a renin-dependent mechanism in the former, and a renin-independent mechanism in the latter diet. There were two subgroups of response to the 100 meq diet: one group (n = 5) achieved neutral balance, while the second (n = 5) avidly retained sodium and water. Renin-angiotensin system activity was significantly higher in the latter group, and the mechanism for differences in sodium excretion for the subgroups could not be identified by blood volume or hemodynamic parameters. Orthostatic hypotension during tilt was greater during the 10 meq sodium diet, and in all cases, related to ineffective hemodynamic and hormonal compensatory responses.", 
    "169": "The effects of verapamil infusion alone and superimposed with captopril on arterial pressure and bilateral renal function were evaluated in 21 two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats and in 13 control rats. Verapamil significantly decreased arterial pressure of both hypertensive and control rats. Addition of captopril further reduced arterial pressure in hypertensive rats only. There were significant increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine flow and absolute and fractional excretory rates of sodium and potassium in the non-clipped kidney. In contrast, these renal indices decreased in the clipped kidney. Superimposed captopril during verapamil infusion did not significantly change function of the non-clipped kidney but further depressed function of the clipped kidney. In control rats, no significant change in GFR occurred in response to drugs. Renal excretion of water and sodium, but not potassium, increased after verapamil. However, the diuresis and natriuresis were less pronounced than those seen in the non-clipped kidney of hypertensive rats. There was a proportionate increase in osmolar clearance and free water reabsorption rate in the non-clipped kidney and the normal kidney. The linear relationship did not change after verapamil infusion. The results suggest that verapamil enhances the excretory function of the non-clipped kidney of Goldblatt hypertensive rats via increased GFR and decreased tubular reabsorption in the proximal and/or distal tubules despite its hypotensive action.", 
    "170": "The new orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (S9490-3) was evaluated in 18 normotensive men. In three subjects the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I was tested. A 8 mg oral dose reduced the pressor response by greater than 80%. Single oral perindopril doses of 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg were given to groups of five subjects each. Eight and 16 mg decreased plasma ACE activity within 4 hours to less than 10% of control; 72 hours later, plasma ACE activity was still reduced by at least 40%. Doses of 4 and 8 mg po once a day were then given for 8 days to two groups of six subjects. Four hours after the first and the last morning doses, plasma angiotensin II, aldosterone, and plasma ACE activity fell significantly, whereas blood angiotensin I and plasma renin activity rose. There was no evidence of drug accumulation. No significant change in blood pressure or heart rate was observed. Thus in normotensive subjects, perindopril seems an effective, orally active, long-lasting ACE inhibitor.", 
    "171": "The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of enalapril and a combination of a thiazide diuretic (altizide) and a diuretic that reduce potassium excretion (spironolactone), in patients presenting moderate essential hypertension. The four-month, double-blind study of two parallel groups involved 20 patients (12 males, 8 females) of mean age 54 years. All patients first received placebo for 15 days. Subsequently, 10 patients received 20 mg enalapril per day and 10 patients 15 mg altizide combined with 25 mg spironolactone in the same tablet. Blood pressure was measured every five minutes for 30 minutes with an automatic apparatus (Dynamap 845), before administration of placebo, before treatment and one, two and three months after treatment. There was no significant change of pulse rate with enalapril or with the diuretic combination. Both treatments produced an identical significant drop in systolic pressure. On the other hand enalapril seemed more efficacious in reducing diastolic pressure at the fourth month: respective pressures 98.2 +/- 13.3 mmHg and 81.0 +/- 8.5 mmHg (p less than 0.005) with enalapril, 98.6 +/- 7.4 mmHg and 86.0 +/- 6.1 mmHg (p less than 0.001) with the diuretic association (17% versus 12%, p less than 0.05). Safety was good with both medicinal preparations and the few side-effects noted did not necessitate withdrawal of treatment.", 
    "172": "A sensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) capable of measuring either lisinopril (1-[N2-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-lysyl] -L-proline) or enalaprilat (1-[N-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl] -L-proline), the active metabolite of enalapril has been developed. A suitable antiserum was raised against an immunogen prepared from conjugation of lisinopril, the lysyl analogue of enalapril, with succinoylated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. A novel radiotracer was also prepared for use in the assay by acylation of the epsilon amine group on the lysyl side chain of lisinopril with N-succinimidyl [2,3-3H]propionate. The antiserum was used at a final dilution of 1:44,500 and the sensitivity of the assay for enalaprilat was estimated at 2 pmol/mL plasma sample and 0.4 pmol/mL for lisinopril. Enalapril, the ethyl ester of enalaprilat, exhibited little cross-reactivity (0.005%), and several other compounds (captopril, proline, lysine, tyrosine, hippuric acid, and tryptophan) were found not to crossreact. In rabbits given a 2.03 mumol/kg iv dose of enalapril, plasma concentrations of enalaprilat were determined by the RIA technique and compared with an estimation of the enalaprilat concentrations derived from the extent of inhibition of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The plasma levels estimated by ACE inhibition were less than those obtained by the RIA in the first 45 min but were always greater in the samples taken after this time. Both assay methods showed that the conversion of enalapril to enalaprilat was rapid, and also indicated that there was initial rapid clearance of enalaprilat from the plasma.", 
    "173": "In order to investigate the consequences of antihypertensive therapy on hormonal and renal parameters in one-clip, two kidney renovascular hypertension, we compared the effects of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) with those of tripletherapy (clonidine, dihydralazine and furosemide) in this experimental model in rats. The treatment period was initiated four weeks after application of the clip and was continued for five weeks. In plasma, renin was increased and renin substrate was negatively correlated to plasma renin. Hypertension was associated with activation of the renin angiotensin system in both plasma and kidney. The degree of activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the clipped kidney and its suppression in the unclipped kidney was evaluated by two methods, renal renin content and semi-quantification of juxtaglomerular hyperplasia by immunofluorescent renin. These two methods were correlated. During the treatment period, average systolic blood pressure was 144 +/- 13 mmHg in the CEI treated group (HT1) which was not significantly different from the value found in the sham-operated group (139 +/- 4 mmHg; C2). Blood pressure, however, was lowered only to 173 +/- 18 mmHg in the group treated with tripletherapy (HT2). In control hypertensive animals, the wt of the clipped kidney did not decrease whereas significant hypertrophy was present in the unclipped kidney. Tripletherapy did not alter this relationship, whereas converting enzyme inhibition decreased kidney wt in the clipped kidney and increased further the hypertrophy of the contralateral unclipped kidney. A histological examination revealed that hypertensive microangiopathy was a predominant feature in the unclipped kidney of the untreated hypertensive group and of the group treated with tripletherapy, these lesions were completely absent in the CEI treated group. In the CEI treated group, however, ischemic lesions during this treatment were found to be decreased in the contralateral unclipped kidney and increased in the clipped kidney by comparison with untreated hypertensive rats. These renal lesions observed in the clipped kidney were most likely related to the normalization of blood pressure or to a disturbance of intrarenal mechanisms normally mediated by the renin-angiotensin system during stenosis of a renal artery.", 
    "174": "Patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension (mean untreated supine blood pressure 190/112 mm Hg) received once daily enalapril 20-40 mg or atenolol 50-100 mg, supplemented if required by hydrochlorothiazide 25-100 mg, in a randomized observer-blind trial. Both regimens produced a highly significant reduction in supine and standing blood pressure. There was no significant difference in the antihypertensive effects of enalapril and atenolol when they were used as monotherapy. After hydrochlorothiazide was added to patients not achieving 'target' blood pressure, the fall in systolic pressure was significantly greater in the enalapril group than in the atenolol group, despite similar dosage of hydrochlorothiazide in the two groups. At the end of 6 months' treatment, a supine diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or below was achieved in 74% of patients on enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide and 56% of patients on atenolol plus hydrochlorothiazide. This difference was not statistically significant. A small rise in plasma urea and creatinine was observed in the enalapril group and a small rise of urea only in the atenolol group. These changes were statistically significant but of uncertain clinical importance. This study confirms that once daily enalapril and atenolol, both alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, are effective drugs in the management of moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "175": "Twenty-seven subjects with essential hypertension were prospectively followed for a minimum of 100 weeks, receiving either enalapril monotherapy or enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy. Blood pressure and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were assessed following 4 weeks of placebo therapy, and 56 and 96 weeks of maintenance drug therapy. Blood pressure was well controlled with either form of therapy. Plasma renin activity remained stimulated following both long-term monotherapy and combination therapy. However, immunoreactive plasma angiotensin II concentration was not suppressed following either long-term monotherapy or combination therapy. Similarly, plasma aldosterone concentration was not suppressed following either form of therapy; indeed, combination therapy was associated with stimulation of plasma aldosterone concentration. We conclude that enalapril monotherapy or enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide therapy was effective in controlling blood pressure, but that long-term blood pressure control must be related to an angiotensin II independent antihypertensive mechanism.", 
    "176": "The preparation of a series of 1,4-thiazepine-2,5-diones, 1,4-thiazine-2,5-diones, and 1,4-benzothiazepine-2,5-diones and their ability in inhibiting the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro and in vivo were examined. These compounds are assumed to act as prodrugs since they undergo rapid ring-opening reactions to give the corresponding biologically active free SH compounds when incubated with rat plasma or when treated with aqueous 0.1 N HCl or phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The thiazepines 23-25 and 30 are potent inhibitors of ACE when administered po to rats and are comparable in potency to captopril (1). The most active thiazines in rats, po, were 42 and 45. Of the benzothiazepines studied, 22a was the most active in inhibiting ACE in the conscious normotensive rat, ID50 = 0.15 mg/kg, po. The acute antihypertensive effects of oral administration of a number of these compounds on mean arterial pressure and heart rate were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) maintained on a sodium-deficient diet.", 
    "177": "The effects of captopril on effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were studied using a noninvasive radioisotopic method on individual kidneys in eight patients with renovascular hypertension and 12 patients with essential hypertension with various renin levels. Four patients with renovascular hypertension had unilateral while three had bilateral renal artery stenosis. The effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were determined by using 131I-iodohippurate sodium and 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were significantly reduced in the stenotic kidneys of patients with renovascular hypertension compared with values in nonstenotic kidneys (p less than 0.01). Treatment with captopril, 37.5 to 75 mg/day for 1 to 48 weeks, further reduced the glomerular filtration rate only in stenotic kidneys, and effective renal plasma flow increased in both kidney types. In two of the three renal hypertensive patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, captopril produced a reversible azotemia that was unrelated to the fall in blood pressure, as evidenced by the lack of azotemia seen after a moderate blood pressure reduction induced by other antihypertensive medications. These results indicate that endogenous angiotensin II is essential in maintaining the glomerular filtration rate in stenotic kidneys and suggest that a reduction in glomerular filtration rate during captopril administration could indicate the presence of renal artery stenosis.", 
    "178": "Recurrence of hypertension is reported in a considerable percentage of renovascular hypertensive patients treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTRA); among the possible mechanisms for these failures, restenosis of the renal artery is the only correctable one. Since captopril stimulates renin secretion to a greater extent in renovascular than in essential hypertensive patients, we determined if it could be used to unmask significant restenosis in the patients with hypertension recurring after PTRA. Follow-up study was performed in 28 patients treated with PTRA. We found that captopril caused a greater increase in peripheral plasma renin activity in 8 of 8 cases who had recurrence of hypertension and restenosis than in 13 of 15 of the patients who did not. We suggest that the determination of captopril-stimulated renin may provide a useful, simple and economical tool for the detection of restenosis after PTRA.", 
    "179": "Hypertension in the elderly is a common problem confronting the practitioner today. The rationale for treating hypertensive elderly patients is presented in this article. Guidelines for the use of specific agents for the treatment of older patients are also discussed.", 
    "180": "The adrenoceptor blocking properties and hypotensive effects of the alpha-1 blocking agents urapidil and prazosin were compared in conscious instrumented rats. Both urapidil and prazosin in i.v. doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg and 0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg, respectively, blocked the pressor response to the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. The hypotensive effects of urapidil and prazosin in these doses were equivalent. Mechanisms of the blood pressure compensation to urapidil-induced hypotension were examined with the arginine vasopressin (AVP) antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, MK-422. Urapidil alone (6 mg/kg i.v.) and after the AVP antagonist caused a similar degree of hypotension (22 and 15% decrease, respectively, in mean blood pressure). When the alpha-1 antagonist was administered after converting enzyme inhibition, it caused a significantly greater decrease in blood pressure (37%) than in the previous two groups, but not different from that obtained after combined AVP antagonism and converting enzyme inhibition (30% decrease). These results indicate that the renin-angiotensin system compensates for the hypotensive effect due to alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade, whereas AVP, even assuming that the circulating level was increased by urapidil, was without effect on blood pressure.", 
    "181": "The present study was designed: (a) to examine the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to elevated regional vascular resistance during the onset of aortic coarctation hypertension, and (b) to determine the role of angiotensin II (Ang II)-neural interactions during the maintenance of high arterial pressure (AP). In the first study, rats were instrumented chronically with miniaturized pulsed Doppler flow probes on the right renal and superior mesenteric arteries 3 days prior to complete aortic ligation. After ligation, AP and renal and mesenteric vascular resistances increased significantly. In sham-ligated rats, small increases in AP and decreases in regional vascular resistances were observed. Captopril, administered 6 h postligation, reduced AP and regional vascular resistance in ligated rats to preligation levels, indicating that the RAS was responsible for these acute increases. In the second study, Ang II-neural interactions were examined by treating 12- to 14-day postligation hypertensive rats with captopril or with hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocker, followed by captopril. Depressor responses to captopril were also examined in aortic-ligated rats pretreated with hydralazine. Captopril alone and captopril after hydralazine caused similar reductions in AP (-26 +/- 2% and -27 +/- 1%, respectively). After ganglionic blockade, the depressor responses to captopril were attenuated (-13 +/- 2%). The marked differences in the efficacy of captopril to lower AP in the ganglionic-blocked group of rats suggested that the pressor actions of Ang II were mediated, in part, through indirect actions on the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "182": "Chronic daily administration of cilazapril (1 X 10 mg/kg/day p.o., from age 4 to 14 weeks) to young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) prevented the development of hypertension. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose of cilazapril persisted greater than 24 h. Discontinuation of long-term treatment resulted in an increase of systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) to control hypertensive levels within 4 days. Following 10 weeks of drug administration, comparative hemodynamic studies were carried out on age-matched (14 weeks) control SHR and cilazapril-treated SHR. Cilazapril-treated SHR had a significantly lower mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and total peripheral vascular resistance than did control SHR. The antihypertensive effect of cilazapril was not associated with changes in heart rate (HR). The myocardial performance parameters, cardiac output, and stroke volume, were similar in treated and control SHR, suggesting that the antihypertensive effect of cilazapril following chronic administration to SHR is mainly due to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance. Vasopressor responses to angiotensin I were significantly lower in cilazapril-treated SHR than in control SHR. By contrast, pressor responses to angiotensin II and a high dose of norepinephrine (1.0 microgram/kg i.v.) were significantly enhanced. Isoproterenol elicited a fall in blood pressure in both groups, the extent of which was dependent upon the magnitude of basal blood pressure levels. Chronic cilazapril treatment resulted in a reduction of heart weight, suggesting that the drug may prevent development of cardiac hypertrophy in SHR. Kidney and adrenal weights were unaffected by the chronic treatment. Specific renin activities (SRA) in tissues of SHR were increased by factors of 20 (plasma) or 2 (kidney and adrenal) following cilazapril administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "183": "The relationship between blood pressure lowering activity and inhibition of plasma and tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been studied in the sodium deficient normotensive rat at 24, 48 and 96 h after the administration for 21 days of enalapril (MK-421, 10 mg/kg per day p.o.). Blood pressure was reduced and plasma ACE activity inhibited at 24 and 48, but not 96 h, after cessation of dosing. Tissue ACE activity (aorta, lung, mesenteric bed) was inhibited up to 96 h post dose when blood pressure had returned to control values. ACE production (activity following removal of inhibitor) was increased in plasma at 24, 48 and 96 h post dose but in tissues (adrenal glands, renal arteries and mesenteric bed) only at 48 h post dose. There was no tendency for ACE production to increase in the lung, the largest source of the enzyme in the rat. Thus it appears that inhibition of ACE activity in both plasma and tissue contributes to the blood pressure lowering activity of enalapril in the sodium deficient normotensive rat.", 
    "184": "As intact macrophages inactivated bradykinin, the subcellular localization of the bradykinin-inactivating activity was studied using guinea-pig macrophages. The bradykinin-inactivating activity was found to be present in membrane and cytosol fractions but not in granular and nuclear fractions. The bradykinin-inactivating activity of the membrane fraction was inhibited by captopril, a specific inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, whereas that of the cytosol fraction was hardly inhibited by various proteinase inhibitors used. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity was located predominantly in the membrane fraction and its activity was inhibited by captopril. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity measured with a synthetic substrate was competitively inhibited by bradykinin, suggesting that bradykinin is a possible substrate for macrophage angiotensin I-converting enzyme. When macrophages were modified chemically by diazotized sulfanilic acid, a poorly permeant reagent, both the bradykinin-inactivating activity and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity of macrophages decreased significantly without any inhibition of the cytosol bradykinin-inactivating activity. These findings seem to suggest that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme would be responsible for the inactivation of bradykinin in intact macrophages.", 
    "185": "Enalapril, atenolol, and hydrochlorothiazide were compared in a double-blind randomised parallel study in general practice. 436 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were included at 76 centres. A two-week placebo run-in period was followed by 16 weeks of monotherapy. The initial doses were: enalapril 20 mg; atenolol 50 mg; and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. These were doubled if treatment was not effective after 4 weeks. Adverse reactions were the main reason for withdrawal from the study (9 on enalapril, 19 on atenolol, and 8 on hydrochlorothiazide). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in all three groups. The reduction in systolic blood pressure was greater on enalapril than on atenolol. Serum potassium was reduced and uric acid increased on hydrochlorothiazide. Fasting blood sugar rose on atenolol but fell on enalapril. The frequency of adverse reactions was acceptable in all three groups. After 16 weeks on treatment significantly more adverse reactions were recorded in the atenolol group than in the enalapril group. Enalapril is effective and well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "186": "The effect of bilateral nephrectomy, and administration of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, on the recovery of arterial blood pressure after hemorrhage (loss of 1% of b.wt), was studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Neither manoeuver significantly affected the recovery of blood pressure within the first 10 min after hemorrhage. Thereafter, the recovery of the blood pressure was markedly suppressed. The study suggests that the initial recovery of blood pressure is unrelated to the kidneys, but the later one requires their presence and depends on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "187": "A number of peptide hydroxamic acids have been synthesized and have been shown to be inhibitors of human skin collagenase. One of these, Z-Pro-Leu-Gly-NHOH, has an IC50 value of 4 X 10(-5)M. Corresponding peptides with different C-terminal functional groups, such as amide, carboxylate and aldehyde, showed little or no inhibition, indicating the importance of the hydroxamate functional group. In addition, the peptide sequence of this effective inhibitor corresponds closely to that of the cleavage site of native collagen, the substrate for the enzyme. Thus, substrate analogs incorporating a suitable metal coordinating group serve as potential inhibitors of human collagenase.", 
    "188": "Among various tannins tested, Areca II-5-C, a fraction isolated from seeds of Areca catechu L., showed the most potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in vitro. Its antihypertensive activity was therefore investigated in normotensive and spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) after both oral and intravenous (i.v.) administration. The activity was compared with that of captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline), a potent ACE inhibitor. Oral administration of Areca II-5-C to SHR produced a lasting, dose-related antihypertensive effect, and the responses obtained with doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg were comparable to those of captopril at doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg. Intravenous administration of Areca II-5-C to SHR produced a rapid and marked reduction in blood pressure at doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg. The maximum antihypertensive effect of Areca II-5-C in SHR, at an i.v. dose of 15 mg/kg, was about 5 times as large as that of captopril at the same dose. Although the vasopressor response to norepinephrine and vasodepressor responses to bradykinin and acetylcholine were not appreciably changed by i.v. treatment with Areca II-5-C at a dose of 5 mg/kg, it did produce dose-related inhibition of the pressor responses to angiotensin I and II. It is suggested that Areca II-5-C has favorable properties as a hypotensive drug through its ability to inhibit the pressor responses to both angiotensin I and II.", 
    "189": "Certain hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are thought to depend on coupling of reactive species (the drug itself or a metabolite) to macromolecules, leading to the formation of hapten-carrier conjugates. In assays for the detection of antibodies directed against such reactive species the drug or metabolite must be used in conjugated rather than free form. We describe ELISAs for the detection of anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP), anti-captopril (CP) and anti-sulphanilamidobenzoic acid (SABA) antibodies, in which the wells of microtitre plates are coated with hapten conjugated to protein. We define coating conditions and the following 3 criteria for identification of anti-hapten activity: Immunoglobulin in the test sample binds to the immobilised hapten-protein conjugate, but not to the immobilised protein alone. Binding is inhibited by preincubation of the test sample with protein conjugates incorporating the test hapten, but not by preincubation with the same unconjugated proteins, nor protein conjugates incorporating haptenic groups unrelated to the test hapten. The inhibitory hapten-protein conjugates are shown to be inactive in unrelated antigen-antibody interactions. Binding is blocked by preincubation of the test sample with low molecular weight chemical derivatives of the reactive hapten. The inhibitory derivatives must be shown to be inactive in unrelated antigen-antibody interactions. On the basis of these criteria, IgG anti-DNP and IgG anti-CP were detected in the sera of immunized rabbits. The IgG anti-DNP antibody recognised protein-conjugated DNP, DNP-lysine, N-acetyl-DNP-lysine and DNP-S-glutathione, whereas the IgG anti-CP antibody recognised CP-S-S-protein and CP-S-S-CP. By the same criteria IgG anti-SABA was detected in the sera of immunized mice. The antibody recognised free and protein-conjugated SABA, but not free sulphanilamide.", 
    "190": "The formation of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) (measured as the stable metabolites 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2) during stimulation with vasoactive autacoids was registered in human umbilical arteries perfused in vitro. Responses were registered within 3-4 minutes after addition of the substances. Both angiotensin I and II were found to increase the formation of PGI2 while depressing that of TXA2. Serotonin increased the formation of TXA2 but not that of PGI2. Both PGE2 and PGF2 alpha stimulated the PGI2 formation. The TXA2 mimetic U46619, increased PGI2 production, whereas PGI2 slightly increased the formation of TXA2. All responses were found to be completely inhibited by indomethacin.", 
    "191": "The effect of adrenalectomy on renin secretion was investigated in conscious rats with glucocorticoid-induced hypertension. Adrenalectomized and sham-operated rats were made hypertensive with methylprednisolone acetate (20 mg/kg s.c. once/week X 2 weeks) supplemented with deoxycorticosterone pivalate (10 mg/kg s.c. once/week X 2 weeks). During the 2 week developmental phase of hypertension, tap water or isotonic saline was given as drinking fluid to respectively 10 and 13 adrenalectomized rats and 10 and 11 sham-operated rats. On the day of the acute administration of captopril or vehicle there was no significant difference in body weight, mean blood pressure, heart rate, serum electrolytes and plasma norepinephrine levels between the 4 groups of rats. Circulating epinephrine could not be detected in adrenalectomized rats. Plasma renin activity was markedly higher in adrenalectomized rats than in the sham-operated rats even after sodium supplementation. Captopril (10 mg/kg i.v.) produced no significant blood pressure lowering effect in rats given tap water to drink, either adrenalectomized (n = 11) or sham-operated (n = 10). These findings indicate that the activation of the renin-angiotensin system in adrenalectomized rats with glucocorticoid-induced hypertension is not directly mediated by the development of adrenal failure. They also show that the maintenance of high blood pressure in this form of experimental hypertension is not significantly enhanced when renin secretion is stimulated by adrenalectomy.", 
    "192": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of captopril at three concentrations (1, 10 and 80 micrograms/ml) against reperfusion injury after 15 min of coronary ligation in the isolated perfused rat heart. During ischemia, the apex displacement (AD) and pressure rate index (PI) decreased markedly and only in the presence of 80 micrograms captopril less reduction of the PI was obtained (p less than 0.05). Upon reperfusion, the AD and PI improved significantly in all captopril treated hearts, depending on the concentration used, whereas the untreated hearts showed a further deterioration (p less than 0.05). Ventricular fibrillation upon reperfusion occurred in 6/6 untreated hearts, but only in 4/6 hearts at 1 microgram/ml, in 2/6 hearts at 10 micrograms/ml and 0/6 hearts at 80 micrograms/ml captopril with a significantly shorter duration (p less than 0.05). In control hearts a marked overflow of purines and norepinephrine was found in the coronary effluent upon reperfusion. In contrast, captopril decreased purine overflow, most at 80 micrograms/ml, and norepinephrine levels were undetectable at all concentrations. These results indicate concentration-dependent protective effects of captopril after local ischemia and reperfusion, already present at therapeutic levels. Reduction of cellular injury and suppression of NE release appear to play an important role in the improvement of mechanical function and the reduction of reperfusion arrhythmias.", 
    "193": "The antihypertensive efficacy of minoxidil and captopril was compared in 23 males with essential or renal parenchymatous hypertension refractory to conventional antihypertensive drug therapy. Following a pretreatment period the patients were randomly assigned to receive either minoxidil, 2.5 mg twice daily (n = 12), or captopril, 25 mg twice daily (n = 11). In patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg, doses of minoxidil and captopril were increased in 2-week intervals. Patients who maintained diastolic pressure greater than 95 mmHg and/or those with intolerable side effects were switched over to the alternative substance. After a mean observation period of 12 weeks a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed (179/114 vs 148/92 mmHg in the minoxidil group; 176/111 vs 158/97 mmHg in the captopril group). The primary response rate was 75% in patients treated with minoxidil and 55% in those with captopril (not significant). After the change to the alternative substance two of the four non-responders on captopril and one of the two non-responders on minoxidil became responders. Side effects occurred significantly more often during minoxidil than captopril (p less than 0.05). The high efficacy of minoxidil and captopril in the treatment of severe hypertension refractory to conventional drugs was confirmed. Minoxidil lowered blood pressure slightly more than captopril, but it had a higher incidence of side effects than captopril.", 
    "194": "Experience with chronic inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme in children is limited to cases refractory to all other forms of treatment. In reports dealing with the use of captopril (Capoten-R) in children no important side-effects are mentioned. This report describes a 7-year-old boy with severe hypertension secondary to haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Good pressure control was obtained after introduction of captopril. However, under the high initial dosage, pronounced anaemia developed within the first 3 months of treatment. The anaemia responded to dose-reduction while pressure control was maintained. Serial echocardiographic studies were performed. They illustrate the beneficial haemodynamic effects of captopril in the follow-up of children under antihypertensive treatment. Some recommendations are made on the use of captopril in children.", 
    "195": "The pharmacokinetics of captopril were studied in 12 healthy male volunteers aged 65 to 76 years, who each received a single 100-mg oral dose. Blood and urine samples were collected over a 24-hour period, and assayed for unchanged captopril (CAP), S-methylcaptopril (Me-CAP, plasma concentrations from 2 subjects only), and total captopril levels (TOT, a mixture of CAP and its dimer and mixed disulfides with endogenous thiol-containing compounds such as glutathione and cysteine). Mean values for the maximum concentration (Cmax) were 803 and 66.3 ng/mL for CAP and Me-CAP, respectively. Mean time to maximum concentration (tmax) was determined as 1.0, 1.4, and 1.0 for CAP, TOT, and Me-CAP, respectively. Mean areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were 1,394 hr-ng/mL (CAP, 0-8 hr) and 17,316 hr-ng/mL (TOT, 0-24 hr). The mean estimated half-life (t 1/2) for CAP was 1.4 hr, and its renal clearance was 187 mL/hr/kg. Mean urinary excretion over 24 hr was 20.8 and 53.1 for CAP and TOT, respectively. Cmax, and AUC for CAP were 9% less and 13% greater, respectively, than in a historical control group of 18-35-year-old men, treated in the same clinic, by the same personnel, using the same analytic procedures, whereas the 24-hour urinary excretion was 25% lower and eight-hour renal clearance 36% lower in the older population. Since the values for Cmax, AUC, and t 1/2 were similar in the two populations, it does not appear that the pharmacokinetics of CAP are altered markedly with age alone.", 
    "196": "Captopril was tested in acute experiments on anesthetized cats subject to cardiopulmonary bypass. The drug was shown to reduce total peripheral vascular resistance and to increase vascular bed capacity.", 
    "197": "Nifedipine and captopril are potent vasodilators and may be expected to help left ventricular failure by reducing afterload. Nifedipine (20 mg three times a day) and captopril (50 mg three times a day) were added to an optimal regimen of digitalis and diuretics in a double blind crossover trial in 18 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. New York Heart Association functional class rating symptoms and exercise tolerance times improved on captopril but not on nifedipine. The reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and the increase of cardiac output on captopril indicated that the augmented functional capacity may have resulted in part from an improved performance of the left ventricle. Although there were comparable decreases in systemic vascular resistance and presumably in impedence to ejection by the left ventricle on both drugs, the dimensions of the ventricular cavity were found to be reduced by captopril and augmented by nifedipine, and only captopril reduced the afterload (wall stress). In addition, the force-length relation (between left ventricular end systolic stress and end systolic diameter) was shifted to the left of baseline by captopril and to the right by nifedipine, suggesting that muscle contractility was reduced by nifedipine and not by captopril. These results suggest that nifedipine and captopril have different effects on afterload and contractility and these may account for the different effects of these drugs on the performance of the heart and clinical responses.", 
    "198": "To develop a screening test for identifying renovascular hypertension, the blood pressure and plasma renin activity responses to an oral test dose of captopril were studied in 246 quietly seated hypertensive patients. The following criteria were developed that exploit the hyperresponsiveness of renin secretion in renovascular hypertensive patients: a 60-minute post-captopril plasma renin activity of 12 ng/ml per hour or more and an absolute plasma renin activity increase of 10 ng/ml per hour or more, along with a 150 percent increase in plasma renin activity (or a 400 percent increase if the baseline plasma renin activity was below 3 ng/ml per hour). Retrospectively, the test identified, among 200 hypertensive patients without evidence of renal dysfunction, all 56 patients with proved renovascular disease. In this group, false-positive results occurred only in two of 112 patients with essential hypertension and in six with secondary hypertension. Nine untreated patients had blood pressure levels of less than 160/100 mm Hg. The test was neither as sensitive nor specific in the 46 patients with renal insufficiency. This study demonstrates that the renin response to oral captopril is a useful screening test for identifying patients with unilateral or bilateral renovascular disease. Since the test also characterizes the renin dependency of the hypertension, it may have other diagnostic and therapeutic uses.", 
    "199": "Ten patients with advanced congestive heart failure were treated with an arginine vasopressin V1 antagonist during hemodynamic monitoring to determine the contribution of vasopressin to vasoconstriction in this disorder. The vasopressin antagonist caused a decrease in systemic vascular resistance in the three patients whose plasma vasopressin was greater than 4.0 pg/ml (average for the group was 2.4 +/- 0.6). Plasma vasopressin concentration correlated with the percent decrease of systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.70, p less than 0.025), serum sodium (r = 0.72, p less than 0.02) and serum creatinine (r = 0.85, p less than 0.005). To compare the relative roles of vasopressin, the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system, these patients also received captopril and phentolamine. Captopril decreased systemic vascular resistance by 20% (p less than 0.05), mostly in patients with high plasma renin activity. Levels of plasma renin activity ranged between 1 and 46 ng/ml per h (average 14.7 +/- 5.7) and correlated with serum sodium (r = 0.77, p less than 0.025), serum creatinine (r = 0.73, p less than 0.025) and right atrial pressure (r = 0.67, p less than 0.05). Phentolamine decreased systemic vascular resistance in all patients (average 34%, p less than 0.01), but the decrease did not correlate with the pretreatment norepinephrine concentration. Norepinephrine levels were elevated in all patients (694 +/- 110 pg/ml) and correlated with baseline stroke volume index (r = 0.75, p less than 0.025) and plasma renin activity (r = 0.67, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "200": "A case of chronic congestive cardiac failure and peripheral vascular disease due to thromboembolism was treated with captopril. Marked improvement was noted in the cardiac status and peripheral vascular lesion both acutely and in the long-term follow-up.", 
    "201": "Effects of angiotensin II on rat, rabbit, and bovine proximal tubular reabsorption have been demonstrated with a variety of techniques, including in vivo microperfusion, free-flow micropuncture of surface and juxtamedullary nephrons, perfusion of isolated tubules in vitro, and cell culture. Blockade of endogenous angiotensin production in vivo with converting-enzyme inhibition, or of receptors with saralasin, consistently inhibits proximal reabsorption of fluid in both superficial and juxtamedullary proximal tubules. Angiotensin effects on the proximal tubule are not neurally mediated, for they persist in denervated kidneys and are seen in nerve-free isolated tubules. Physiological concentrations of angiotensin (10(-11)-10(-9) M) stimulate electroneutral sodium transport from the basolateral membrane, whereas pharmacological doses (10(-7) M and above) inhibit reabsorption. The stimulatory effects appear to be receptor mediated. In addition to these direct effects of angiotensin on the proximal tubule epithelium, endogenous angiotensin may also alter peritubular physical forces to further enhance proximal reabsorption. These effects of angiotensin may represent an important homeostatic mechanism during states of extracellular fluid volume depletion.", 
    "202": "In addition to its extrarenal functions, including the control of arterial pressure and aldosterone secretion, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) also has multiple intrarenal actions in controlling glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and sodium excretion. Angiotensin II (AngII) helps to prevent excessive decreases in GFR in different physiological and pathophysiological conditions by preferentially constricting the efferent arterioles, an action that can be mediated by either intrarenally formed or circulating AngII. Circulating AngII and intrarenally formed AngII do not appear to directly constrict preglomerular vessels, including the afferent arterioles, when the RAS is activated physiologically. The sodium-retaining action of AngII may be due, in part, to constriction of efferent arterioles and to subsequent changes in peritubular capillary physical forces. However, AngII may also directly stimulate sodium reabsorption in proximal and distal tubules, although the exact site at which AngII increases distal tubular transport is still uncertain. Considerable evidence indicates that the direct intrarenal effects of AngII on tubular reabsorption, including those caused by changes in peritubular capillary physical forces or a direct action on tubular transport, are quantitatively more important than those mediated by changes in aldosterone secretion. Thus, the intrarenal effects of AngII provide a mechanism for stabilizing the GFR and excretion of metabolic waste products while causing sodium and water retention, thereby helping to regulate body fluid volumes and arterial pressure.", 
    "203": "Evidence accumulates that intrarenal angiotensin II (AngII) plays important roles in the regulation of renal functions. To determine the mechanism and site of the intrarenal formation of AngII, we employed histochemical and cell biological methods. Immunohistochemical studies have revealed the coexistence of renin and AngII in juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, and electron microscopic studies and subcellular organelle fractionation have demonstrated the colocalization of renin and angiotensin in renin granules. The mechanism of this AngII accumulation has been investigated. Immunoreactive angiotensin I (AngI) appeared slowly in JG cells after prolonged administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Cloned and cultured renin-containing cells derived from rat kidney were also found to contain renin, ACE, and AngI and AngII. The subcellular fractionation of renin granules from rat kidney homogenate demonstrated AngI and AngII in the renin granule fractions. These findings suggest the formation of both angiotensins in JG cells. To study the release of AngII, we determined the presence of the angiotensins in renal lymph. Renin was found in renal lymph at a high concentration. Both AngI and AngII were also present in renal lymph in moderate concentrations. It is possible that AngII in the interstitial fluid may play a role in the regulation of renal functions. From these results it has been concluded that AngII is formed in JG cells in the kidney and is secreted with renin into interstitial fluid and plasma, and that AngII formed in the kidney cells may participate in various renal functions.", 
    "204": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was investigated in 8 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) (functional class III) and in twelve controls before and after administration of 6.25 mg and 25 mg captopril, respectively. In four controls, CBF was measured by the intracarotid xenon-133 (133Xe) injection technique using stationary external detectors, while inhalation of 133Xe and single photon emission computer tomography was used in the remaining cases. In the control group, the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen was calculated from measurements of the arterio-venous oxygen difference as well. Mean CBF was significantly (P less than 0.01) lower in the patients with CHF as compared to our controls. Following captopril administration the mean arterial blood pressure decreased in the CHF patients, ranging from 5 to 40%. Three patients showed decreases of blood pressure to values of 56, 65, and 76 mm Hg, but no symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion were elicited. CBF was unchanged after captopril administration, even in the patients showing a marked reduction in blood pressure. In the control group, the blood pressure, CBF and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen remained essentially constant following captopril administration. It is concluded that the cerebral circulation is well preserved during captopril treatment of chronic heart failure. This might be explained by a shift of the lower limit of CBF autoregulation towards lower blood pressure levels.", 
    "205": "We have studied the influence of the renin-angiotensin system on the control of catecholamine release from innervated and denervated adrenal glands of anaesthetized dogs. Captopril reduced the resting release of catecholamines and inhibited release evoked either by lowering carotid sinus pressure or by stimulating the peripheral end of the cut splanchnic nerve. Both responses were restored by exogenous angiotensin II, and the reflex response could also be restored by corticotrophin. Cycloheximide, in the presence of captopril, further reduced the resting release of catecholamines and prevented the restoration of the reflex response by angiotension II. Plasma renin activity did not rise during baroreceptor tests lasting 10 min, but catecholamine release was evoked from the first minute. We conclude that the response of the adrenal medulla to sympathetic activity requires a minimum circulating concentration of angiotensin II. It is severely impaired by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system but function can be restored either by exogenous angiotensin II or by corticotrophin.", 
    "206": "MK351A, a tyrosyl analogue of enalaprilic acid (MK422) is a potent inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). MK351A was radioiodinated with 125I and used to develop a radio inhibitor binding assay for human serum ACE. 125I MK351A associated rapidly and reversibly with human serum ACE (T 1/2 = 1/2 h). Bound 125I MK351A was displaced by an excess of cold MK351A, to give non-specific binding of less than 1%. Scatchard analysis of binding was linear (r = -0.99, n = 6, p less than 0.001), indicating a single class of binding site. ACE was estimated in serum from normal patients and patients with sarcoid by the radio inhibitor binding assay and by enzyme kinetic assay using Hip-His-Leu as substrate. The two methods for ACE estimation correlated closely (r = 0.87, n = 82, p less than 0.001). The radio inhibitor binding assay for human serum ACE is a simple, sensitive and specific assay which utilizes novel assay methodology.", 
    "207": "In shrinking-drop micropuncture studies in anaesthetized rats proximal tubular fluid reabsorption (JVa) decreased by 36% following intravenous infusion of enalapril. In a separate group of rats enalapril reduced fractional lithium clearance indicating decreased proximal fluid reabsorption. Following enalapril, GFR rose by 46% but absolute proximal reabsorption rose by 22% indicating 48% effectiveness of proximal glomerulo-tubular balance (GTB). Since renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased in parallel and arterial pressure fell, fluid uptake and proximal GTB were unlikely to have been decreased by peritubular physical forces. In anaesthetized rats proximal fluid reabsorption and proximal GTB are modulated by endogenous AII through direct stimulation of proximal tubular transport.", 
    "208": "In rat isolated caudal artery preparations, tetradecapeptide renin substrate enhanced the responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation (0.5 Hz, 10 s). In guinea-pig isolated atria, previously incubated in 3H-noradrenaline, tetradecapeptide renin substrate enhanced the stimulation-induced efflux of radioactivity. The facilitation of noradrenergic transmission in rat caudal arteries and guinea-pig atria was blocked by the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin, but was not altered by converting enzyme inhibitors. In the pithed rat tetradecapeptide renin substrate increased blood pressure and this effect was reduced by the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril.", 
    "209": "A randomized, two-way, crossover study was performed on 18 normal volunteers to assess the influence of food on the bioavailability of lisinopril, (1-[N2-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-lysyl]-L-proline), a long-acting nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. A single, 20-mg oral dose of lisinopril was administered to volunteers in the fasting state or following a standardized breakfast. Treatment periods were separated by 2-week intervals. No significant differences existed between fasting and fed regimens in the mean +/- SD area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-120h; 1231 +/- 620 versus 1029 +/- 254 ng X h X ml-1), peak lisinopril serum concentration (86 +/- 48 versus 69 +/- 19 ng/mL), or time to peak lisinopril serum concentration (6.2 +/- 1.1 versus 6.8 +/- 1.0 h). Five-day urinary excretion of lisinopril was not altered by food (5.3 +/- 3.0 versus 5.1 +/- 2.0 mg). Based on the urinary data, the mean +/- SD bioavailability of lisinopril was not different following fasting or fed regimens (27 +/- 15 versus 26 +/- 10%). Unlike with captopril, food did not affect the bioavailability of lisinopril.", 
    "210": "The purpose of this study was to assess whether two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) renal hypertension can be induced in the marmoset. During the first 3-5 weeks after renal arterial clipping, blood pressure (BP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased in approximately one-third of the operated marmosets. However, within 10 weeks after clipping, BP and PRA had returned to control values. There was a significant positive correlation between BP and log PRA 3 and 5 weeks after the operation, but no correlation was observed at 10 weeks. In a selected group of marmosets with the highest values of BP (greater than 140 mmHg; n = 4), the converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (2 mg/kg s.c.) lowered BP by 58 +/- 7 (s.e.m.) mmHg when given 3 weeks after clipping. At 18 weeks the response to enalapril was only -17 +/- 6 mmHg. These results demonstrate that unilateral renal arterial clipping in marmosets results in a transient renin-dependent hypertension. Marmosets in this initial hypertensive phase could be useful for investigating the antihypertensive effects of inhibitors of human renin.", 
    "211": "The present study was designed to investigate in rats the influence of converting enzyme inhibition with captopril on blood pressure, plasma urea, plasma renin concentration (PRC), plasma aldosterone and plasma vasopressin, and to define the interrelationships between PRC and these variables during equal degrees of either hyponatraemic (furosemide, 40 mg/kg for 2 days) or hypernatraemic (48-h water deprivation) dehydration. Chronic treatment with captopril (40 mg/kg daily) decreased blood pressure by 19% in normally hydrated treated rats, by 27% in water-deprived treated rats and by 40% in furosemide-treated rats. Plasma renin concentration, plasma aldosterone and plasma vasopressin were increased during both hypo- and hypernatraemic dehydration. Captopril decreased plasma aldosterone in water-deprived and furosemide-treated rats, whereas plasma vasopressin was unchanged. The significant correlation observed between plasma aldosterone and PRC in non-treated rats persisted in treated rats, the same level of plasma aldosterone being observed at values of PRC 10 times higher. On the other hand, the correlation between plasma vasopressin and PRC did not persist in captopril-treated rats. An increase in plasma urea was observed in both water-deprived treated rats and furosemide-treated rats. These data indicate that during hypo- and hypernatraemic dehydration, the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in regulating blood pressure, urea elimination and plasma aldosterone, but vasopressin regulation is not modified by its inhibition.", 
    "212": "The effect of age on the pharmacodynamic responses to converting enzyme inhibitors, enalapril and enalaprilat was investigated in nine young (22-30 years) and nine sex-matched elderly (65-73 years), healthy volunteers. The groups differed in baseline blood pressure, young 121/64 mmHg, elderly 142/75 mmHg (P less than 0.01), but not in sodium intake or body weight. Both enalapril and enalprilat produced significant falls in blood pressure in both groups but no increase in heart rate in the supine or erect posture. The blood pressure fall was significantly greater in the elderly on both treatments and in both erect and supine posture. The greater fall in blood pressure in the elderly was associated with a more prolonged inhibition of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity. The apparent age-related difference in response appears to be due to the difference in baseline blood pressures between the groups. Further study of the usefulness of chronic dosing with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension in the elderly is indicated.", 
    "213": "The pharmacokinetics of angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enalapril (10 mg orally) and its active metabolite, enalaprilat (10 mg intravenously) were studied in nine young healthy volunteers aged 22-30 years and nine sex matched elderly subjects aged 65-73 years. After both drugs, a biexponential curve was fitted to the decline in plasma enalaprilat concentration. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was greater in the elderly for both drugs. Clearance (CL) and clearance/bioavailability (CL/F) were less in the elderly for enalaprilat and enalapril, respectively. There was no difference in F between young (0.62 +/- 0.16) and elderly subjects (0.61 +/- 0.15). Enalaprilat CL and enalapril CL/F were significantly and positively correlated to endogenous creatinine clearance. There was a significant difference in the weight corrected volume of distribution at steady state after enalaprilat between the young and elderly (P less than 0.02). The relationship between plasma enalaprilat concentrations and percentage ACE inhibition, using the Hill equation, showed no difference in the sensitivity to ACE inhibition between the young and the elderly group. The pharmacokinetic differences observed are likely to be related to an age dependent decline in renal function as well as changes in body composition. Kinetic differences partly explain the greater pharmacodynamic response in the elderly.", 
    "214": "Treatment for 8 days with a new nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril (CI-906), produced a marked and progressive reduction in the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Quinapril was given p.o. in a dose of 20 or 40 mg/kg once daily. Both doses increased plasma renin activity and decreased the urinary excretion of aldosterone. These results, together with a marked decrease in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, indicate that the drug produced a considerable fall in circulating angiotensin II. The urinary excretion of vasopressin was not altered by the smaller dose of quinapril but was reduced by the larger dose, which increased water intake and urine excretion. Quinapril did not affect plasma kininogen or the urinary excretion of kallikrein. The urinary excretion of neither the prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha nor the thromboxane metabolite thromboxane B2 were altered by the drug. However, quinapril did produce a temporary decrease in the excretion of prostaglandin E2, the effect passing off with the continuation of the treatment. These data indicate that vasodilatory prostanoids do not contribute to the blood pressure lowering effect of quinapril in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is probably the principal mechanism of the drug's antihypertensive action, but these results do not rule out the possibility that an increase in vasodilatory kinins may also be involved.", 
    "215": "Following hemodynamic evaluation using invasive and noninvasive methods, 73 patients were treated in an open, uncontrolled, multicenter study with single oral doses of enalapril maleate 1.25 to 40 mg until the optimal dose for each patient (based upon hemodynamic response) was achieved. Diuretics were withheld and reinstituted only if necessary. Hemodynamic measurements were made at 0 (predrug), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours postdrug. Patients were discharged on their optimal dose, treated 1 to 4 months and then rehospitalized for repeat hemodynamic measurements. The optimal enalapril single dose was associated with the following mean peak responses: increased cardiac index 42% (SE = 6) and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 40% (SE = 3), systemic vascular resistance 39% (SE = 2), and mean arterial pressure 23% (SE = 1.5). These changes persisted during chronic therapy. Chronic treatment with enalapril also improved exercise capacity 40% (P less than 0.01), ejection fraction 18% (P less than 0.05) and clinical status (N.Y.H.A. functional class, P less than 0.01). Ten and 20 mg/day, taken as once- or twice-daily regimens, were the most commonly effective doses.", 
    "216": "Thirteen patients were entered into a protocol to assess the safety and efficacy of enalapril (MK 421), 5 to 20 mg b.i.d., and hydrochlorothiazide, 50 to 100 mg daily, for the treatment of renovascular hypertension. Specifically monitored were the effects of therapy on blood pressure and pulse, renal function, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide therapy produced excellent control of blood pressure with no adverse side effects. After approximately 8 weeks of therapy, renal vascular resistance was decreased and no adverse effects on glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow were noted, except in one patient with a functional unilateral stenotic kidney. Patients receiving enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide showed stimulation of plasma renin activity and suppression of plasma angiotensin II, although the initial degree of suppression was not sustained in all patients during prolonged therapy. Although plasma aldosterone concentration was initially suppressed, the degree of suppression was not sustained. Nine patients have been followed for an additional 6 months; none have experienced further progression of renal disease, as assessed by repeated measurements of glomerular filtration and effective renal plasma flow. These results suggest that combined enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide therapy is safe and effective in the medical management of renovascular hypertension and that blood pressure control may be achieved in the absence of sustained interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "217": "The kidney produces angiotensin II (AngII) by conversion of both locally formed and systemically delivered angiotensin I (AngI). The latter may be physiologically significant because the kidney can convert 20-25% of systemically delivered AngI. To determine possible differences between the effects of circulating and locally converted AngII, we compared the renal responses to renal arterial infusions of AngI and AngII in equiconstrictor doses. Both reduced the renal blood flow and increased the filtration fraction; it is important that the AngI infusions consistently reduced glomerular filtration rates (GFR), which indicates effects proximal to or at the glomerulus. Micropuncture experiments revealed that AngI infusions reduced proximal tubular and peritubular capillary pressures and the single-nephron GFR; glomerular capillary pressure was not altered significantly. AngI infusions increased both pre- and postglomerular resistances and reduced the glomerular filtration coefficient. In other studies designed to estimate net intrarenal AngII generation, it was determined that the kidney degrades about 90% of arterially delivered AngII. Thus, most of the AngII in renal venous blood was formed intrarenally. Local production of AngII was enhanced, in association with increased renin release, after reductions in renal arterial pressure. Such increases in intrarenal AngII production may contribute to the AngII-dependent changes in renal vascular resistance that occur in conditions where the renin-angiotensin system is stimulated.", 
    "218": "We have localized angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.14.5.1) in the rat pituitary and adrenal glands by [3H]captopril autoradiography. The maximal numbers of [3H] captopril-binding sites are: posterior pituitary, 4500 fmol/mg protein; anterior pituitary, 1950 fmol/mg; intermediate pituitary, less than 100 fmol/mg; adrenal medulla, 480 fmol/mg; and adrenal cortex, less than 25 fmol/mg. The distribution within the posterior pituitary and adrenal medulla is homogeneous, whereas that in the anterior pituitary is patchy. Subcellular fractionation of the bovine adrenal medulla reveals enrichment of angiotension-converting enzyme in plasma membrane fractions, but not in chromaffin granules. [3H]Captopril autoradiography in the rat pituitary gland is unaltered by dehydration, adrenalectomy, or reserpine treatment and in Brattleboro rats. [3H]Captopril binding in the adrenal medulla is increased by 75% 3 weeks after hypophysectomy and is elevated by 80% after reserpine treatment. The change after hypophysectomy is not reversed by dexamethasone treatment.",

Ketanserin, an antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine, significantly reduced the increase in 1-h albumin space seen 20 h after hCG, as did one aromatase inhibitor (1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione), but the effect of another (testolactone) did not reach significance. Aminoglutethimide, which inhibits overall steroid synthesis as well as aromatase, reduced the albumin space in both control and hCG-injected rats but the hCG response, as judged by the ratio between treated and control rats, was unaffected. Inhibitors of overall steroid synthesis (WIN 32,729), prostaglandin synthesis (meclofenamic acid or indomethacin) and angiotensin converting enzyme (captopril) and blockers of H1 and H2 histamine receptors (mepyramine, cimetidine or ranitidine) were without effect. The time course of the vascular response to hCG is quite different from the response in testosterone secretion by the testis. Considerable numbers of mast cells were found in the vicinity of the testicular artery in the testicular capsule, and these may be a source of 5-hydroxytryptamine.", 
    "220": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (8-33; ANP) caused a prolonged hypotensive response following intravenous injection in anaesthetized rats. This response was abolished by captopril treatment and restored by concomitant angiotensin II infusion. These results suggest that ANP exerts its hypotensive action in the anaesthetized rat by the antagonism of the vasoconstrictor action of endogenous angiotensin II.", 
    "221": "In electrically driven guinea pig left atria, positive inotropic responses to (-)-isoprenaline and the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist RO363 were obtained in the absence and in the presence of the functional antagonists adenosine, carbachol, gallopamil, nifedipine, and Ro 03-7894. Each of the functional antagonists reduced the maximum response to both agonists and produced nonparallel rightward shifts in the cumulative concentration effect curves. For both agonists, dissociation constants (KA) were calculated using the equation described by Furchgott (1966) for irreversible antagonism. For RO363, which is a partial agonist with high agonist activity, the equations outlined for functional interaction by Mackay (1981) were also employed to calculate KA values. The KA values obtained by each method were compared with the dissociation constants (KD) for the two agonists determined from their ability to displace the radioligand (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol from beta 1-adrenoceptors in guinea pig left atrial membrane preparations. The estimates of KA varied substantially from KD values. The KD values were taken as more accurate estimates of the true values for the dissociation constants because a high degree of correlation exists between pKD and pD2 values for a number of other beta-adrenoceptor agonists that behave as partial agonists and between pKD and pKB values for a number of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Thus it appears that there are serious limitations in the current theory for using functional antagonism as a means of obtaining agonist dissociation constants.", 
    "222": "Ketomethylene containing peptide analogs, modeled after a snake venom pentapeptide, have been shown to be potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Although the most potent compounds are up to five times more potent than captopril in inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme activity, they are relatively weak inhibitors of [3H]captopril binding to membrane bound angiotensin converting enzyme. This indicates that inhibition of [3H]captopril binding and enzymatic activity is due to binding to distinct sites. These results suggest that the inhibitors bind to an additional site on the enzyme distinct from the captopril binding site.", 
    "223": "Three classes of carbonyl-containing substrate analogues and partial substrate analogues have been tested for their ability to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme. (4-Oxobutanoyl)-L-proline is proposed to occupy the S1' and S2' subsites on the enzyme, thus locating its aldehyde carbonyl group at the position of the active site zinc atom. This aldehyde is 70% hydrated in aqueous solution and could mimic a tetrahedral intermediate occurring during enzyme-catalyzed substrate hydrolysis, but its Ki is only 760 microM. Carbobenzoxy-L-isoleucyl-L-histidyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalaninal is proposed to occupy the S1 through S4 subsites on the other side of the zinc atom. Its weak Ki of 60 microM is nearly equipotent to its parent peptide terminating in phenylalanine. However, ketoace, (5RS)-(5-benzamido-4-oxo-6-phenylhexanoyl)-L-proline [Almquist, R.G., Chao, W.R., Ellis, M.E., & Johnson, H.L. (1980) J. Med. Chem. 23, 1392-1398], one of the third class of inhibitors proposed to occupy subsites S1 through S2' on both sides of the zinc atom, has a Ki of 0.0006 microM under our assay conditions, orders of magnitude more potent than its parent peptide. The carbonyl carbon of ketoace is less than 3% hydrated in aqueous solution as determined by carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. If the hydrate is the species bound to converting enzyme, its Ki must be less than 18 pM. Ketoace is a slow-binding inhibitor of converting enzyme, but its overall Ki is dependent on its concentration and therefore prevents calculation of kinetic constants for slow binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "224": "Chronic treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors induces a fall of plasma angiotensinogen concentration, which is thought to result from increased consumption by renin. As this explanation cannot account for all the observations, we reexamined this effect. Rats received captopril (50 mg/kg per day), enalapril (10 mg/kg per day) or Hoe 498 (1 mg/kg per day) for 7 days. Plasma angiotensinogen (by indirect assay) fell to 34, 37 and 43% of its initial values, respectively. Total immunoreactive angiotensinogen (by direct radioimmunoassay, which also measures des-AI-angiotensinogen) was 76, 70 and 95% of the initial values, respectively. This suggests that a major part of the fall of intact angiotensinogen can be attributed to increased cleavage by renin, but an additional factor is likely to be involved. Experiments with isolated hepatocytes indicated that converting enzyme inhibitors in high concentrations may have a direct effect on angiotensinogen secretion. Whether this can account for the fall in total immunoreactive angiotensinogen in vivo remain unclear.", 
    "225": "Effect of long-term oral administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor (2R, 4R)-2-(o-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(mercaptopropionyl)-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid (SA446) in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol on the development of hypertension was examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The development of hypertension in SHR was markedly suppressed by the treatment with SA446 (45 mg/kg, p.o.) for 17 weeks from 8 weeks of age, the pre-stage of hypertension. Long-term administration of hydrochlorothiazide (20 mg/kg, p.o.) also showed an obvious antihypertensive effect, but the effect was less potent than that of SA446. On the other hand, propranolol (20 mg/kg, p.o.) showed a slight or little antihypertensive effect. The combined administration of hydrochlorothiazide and SA446 produced a more potent antihypertensive effect than the administration of SA446 alone. On the other hand, the combined use of propranolol had no influence on the antihypertensive effect of SA446 by long-term administration in SHR. Plasma renin activities measured after 17 weeks treatment of the drugs indicated that the renin-angiotensin system was activated by hydrochlorothiazide. These results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of long-term administration of SA446 in SHR is enhanced by the combined administration of diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which activates the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "226": "In order to identify which peptidases are involved in the catabolism of neurotensin in the CNS, [3H-Tyr3,11]-neurotensin was superfused over rat hypothalamic slices in the presence and absence of peptidase inhibitors. The degree of degradation of the peptide was determined by reverse phase HPLC separation of 3H-labelled neurotensin from 3H-labelled products. Very little degrading activity was released from the slice into the medium during the superfusion. In the absence of inhibitors, 20 to 50% of 3H-neurotensin was degraded giving mainly 3H-Tyr along with other unidentified 3H-labelled products. Inhibitors of endopeptidase 24.11 (phosphoramidon) and proline endopeptidase (antibody) had no effect on the degradation. Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, had a small inhibitory effect. In contrast, dynorphin(1-13), an inhibitor of a soluble, thiol dependent metallopeptidase which hydrolyses neurotensin at Arg8-Arg9, gave greater than 80% inhibition of 3H-neurotensin degradation in the slice preparation. 1,10-Phenanthroline, an inhibitor of metallopeptidases, was also an effective inhibitor. The dynorphin sequence responsible for the inhibition contains the Arg6-Arg7 bond. Other peptides (bradykinin and angiotensin) which are substrates of the soluble metallopeptidase also inhibited neurotensin breakdown by the slice. This evidence suggests that this thiol dependent metalloendopeptidase is the major neurotensin catabolizing enzyme in hypothalamic slices.", 
    "227": "Intracerebroventricular captopril produces significantly different effects on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WK) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The compound produces a definite pattern of decrease in the percentage and power of the lower frequency EEG of the SHR. Corresponding action on the WK was confined to a general decrease in the power of the EEG. These findings suggest that certain components of the central renin-angiotensin system in the SHR are abnormal.", 
    "228": "A double blind cross over study was performed to compare the long term hormonal, haemodynamic, and clinical responses to specific inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (captopril) and of the alpha 1 adrenoceptors of the sympathetic system (prazosin) both at rest and during upright exercise in patients with chronic heart failure. Sixteen patients completed one month's treatment with each drug. During conventional diuretic treatment (control) plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and noradrenaline were increased at rest and on exercise. Control left ventricular filling pressures were raised, and correlated significantly with plasma renin activity both at rest and on exercise. Systemic vascular resistance was increased at rest, and its reduction during exercise correlated inversely with the increase in plasma renin activity and plasma noradrenaline. After one month's treatment with captopril there were reductions in plasma aldosterone, weight, left ventricular filling pressure, and systemic vascular resistance at rest and on exercise. Dyspnoea was relieved and exercise capacity increased. The greater fall in systemic vascular resistance on exercise no longer correlated with the increase in plasma renin activity. During treatment with prazosin there were increases in plasma noradrenaline and, transiently, in plasma aldosterone. Fluid retention occurred, and left ventricular filling pressure was unchanged. Compared with control values systemic vascular resistance was reduced at rest but not on exercise. Dyspnoea and exercise capacity did not improve. In chronic heart failure, vasodilatation by inhibition of the alpha adrenergic system with prazosin causes compensatory stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and does not result in clinical benefit. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with captopril causes secondary vasodilatation at rest and on exercise and results in improvement in symptoms and exercise capacity.", 
    "229": "The clinical patterns of acute renal failure have changed in the past 10 to 15 years. Nonoliguric acute tubular necrosis has become more common, as has nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis. Other syndromes that have increased in incidence are acute tubular necrosis secondary to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure secondary to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Calculation of the fractional sodium excretion or the renal failure index helps distinguish between prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis. In a significant number of patients with acute renal failure, a kidney biopsy may be necessary to establish the correct diagnosis and initiate the appropriate therapy.", 
    "230": "The influence of interrupting the renin-angiotensin system on the renal hemodynamic response to barbiturate anesthesia was assessed in conscious, trained, chronically catheterized rats. Anesthesia induced by pentobarbital caused a marked reduction in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). Pretreatment of rats with captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme, prevented the impairment of renal hemodynamics by pentobarbital without restoring blood pressure. GFR remained at 100 to 110% of control values in captopril-pretreated rats receiving pentobarbital, but was reduced by pentobarbital (90-120 min after induction) to 75 +/- 5% in rats which did not receive captopril. ERPF showed similar changes. An antagonist of angiotensin II receptors, 1-sarcosine-8-isoleucine-angiotensin II, did not prevent the anesthesia-induced decrements in GFR and ERPF (GFR was reduced to 78 +/- 6% and ERPF to 68 +/- 4% at 90-120 min after pentobarbital). This failure of the antagonist of angiotensin II receptors to protect renal hemodynamics may have been due to its intrinsic agonist activity on the renal vasculature. This is suggested by the fact that, in captopril-pretreated rats, which maintained renal hemodynamics in response to pentobarbital, addition of 1-sarcosine-8-isoleucine-angiotensin II caused a reduction in GFR and ERPF and an elevated blood pressure. At 100 min after administration of pentobarbital, plasma renin activity was elevated compared to a conscious control group (3.57 +/- 0.42 vs. 1.94 +/- 0.34 ng angiotensin l/ml X hr, P less than .05). It is concluded that the renin-angiotensin system mediates an impairment of renal hemodynamics during pentobarbital anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "231": "To determine if clinically effective doses of the antihypertensive agent captopril affected the neuronal release of norepinephrine or baroreflex sensitivity, changes in plasma norepinephrine concentration and heart rate were related to the changes in mean arterial pressure seen during the intravenous infusion of stepwise incremental doses of sodium nitroprusside before and during captopril treatment in eight hypertensive men with normal or low plasma renin activity. At all times, significant linear correlations were found between the decrease in mean arterial pressure and the dose of sodium nitroprusside, the increase in heart rate and the decrease in mean arterial pressure, and the increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration and the decrease in mean arterial pressure. When the subjects were treated with captopril (25 mg t.i.d.) for 2 to 4 weeks, supine mean arterial pressure decreased from 130 to 114 mm Hg (-12%; p less than 0.05), heart rate did not change, supine and upright plasma renin activity increased, while supine plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration decreased slightly. Therapy with captopril (25 mg t.i.d.) increased baroreflex sensitivity, as assessed by the slope of the regression line relating the increase in heart rate to the decrease in mean arterial pressure, and increased the responsiveness of the sympathetic nervous system, as assessed by the slope of the regression line relating the increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration to the decrease in mean arterial pressure. These increases were accompanied by a decrease in the slope of the regression line relating the decrease in mean arterial pressure to the dose of sodium nitroprusside and thus were associated with a decreased sensitivity to the vasodepressor effects of sodium nitroprusside.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "232": "Fifty patients with congestive heart failure received, by infusion, 15 ml/kg body weight water load, and systemic hemodynamic, renal function, and neurohumoral parameters values were measured before, 2 days, and 1 month after randomly allocating patients to prazosin or captopril therapy. Both prazosin and captopril caused similar and persistent hemodynamic changes, but important differences existed between their renal and neurohumoral effects. After 1 month of continuous therapy, captopril increased creatinine clearance from 71 to 84 ml/min/1.73(2) (p less than .05), increased the water load excreted in 5 hr from 50% to 71% (p less than .005), and increased 5 hr sodium excreted from 6.8 to 14.7 meq (p less than .005), Captopril also caused a decrease in plasma norepinephrine from 568 to 448 pg/ml (p less than .005), in plasma epinephrine from 94 to 73 pg/ml (p less than .05), and in plasma aldosterone from 57 to 28 ng/dl (p less than .005), without changing plasma vasopressin. These beneficial effects were greater after 1 month of therapy than after 2 days. The only beneficial effect of prazosin was to increase water excretion from 49% to 59% (p less than .05). The long-term response to captopril was similar in patients with higher (greater than 2.5 ng/ml/hr) and lower renin levels. However, in patients with lower renin levels, prazosin decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (24.8 to 21.8 mm Hg, p less than .05), decreased plasma arginine vasopressin (1.16 to 0.75 pg/ml, p less than .05), increased water excretion (62% to 85%, p less than .005), and decreased plasma epinephrine (81 to 46 pg/ml, p less than .05), while in patients with higher renin levels none of these beneficial effects were noted. We conclude that captopril produces long-term beneficial renal and neurohumoral effects that prazosin does not despite similar hemodynamic changes with the two drugs, that these effects are at least partially dependent on the initial neurohumoral and hemodynamic status of the patient, and that through hemodynamic improvement vasodilators may chronically interrupt vasopressin overstimulation.", 
    "233": "Thirty-seven patients with severe chronic heart failure were entered into an open-ended trial with milrinone at an initial daily dose ranging form 20 to 30 mg. Mean duration of treatment was 48 weeks and ranged from 1 to 134 weeks. Twenty-five patients (67%) reported a substantial improvement in well-being with less dyspnea or fatigue, but this was not associated with a significant increase in maximal oxygen uptake: 10.2 +/- 2.9 vs 10.7 +/- 2.4 ml/kg/min (NS). At intervals ranging from 6 to 54 weeks, they experienced a recurrence of symptoms that was partially reversed by increasing the dose of milrinone to a maximum of 50 mg/day. In 15 patients whose symptoms could not be controlled by milrinone alone, captopril was added. The combination of captopril and milrinone was well tolerated and produced a symptomatic improvement in 10 of the 15 patients (67%). Maximal oxygen uptake, however, was not significantly increased by addition of captopril to milrinone: 10.6 +/- 2.7 vs 11.6 +/- 3.3 ml/kg/min. Twenty-four patients died: 12 of sudden death and 12 of gradual worsening of heart failure. During prolonged administration of milrinone, no patient experienced overt clinical adverse reactions directly attributable to the drug. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased from 3.6 +/- 0.7 to 4.1 +/- 0.9 cm/m2 (p less than .05) after a mean duration of 50 weeks of milrinone therapy. Accordingly, long-term therapy with milrinone appears to improve functional status without eliciting overt clinical adverse reactions. However, the possibility that milrinone might have contributed to the high mortality noted during this therapeutic trial cannot be excluded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "234": "The effects of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on maternal and foetal blood pressure, heart rate and components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were studied in 9 chronically-cannulated pregnant ewes and their foetuses. Six ewes received 1 mg kg-1 enalapril i.v. while 3 were given 2 mg kg-1. Although the initial fall in blood pressure was slightly greater in the higher dose group, there was substantial overlap of data. The pressor response to angiotensin I, assessing ACE activity, was abolished within 10 min of administration, and did not recover during 3 h of observation. Maternal systolic and diastolic pressures reached a nadir 90 min after administration (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.002 respectively). The maximum tachycardia was seen at 60 min (P less than 0.05). The foetuses of the ewes given 1 mg kg-1 enalapril showed no change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate. Those of the ewes given the higher dose showed late-onset hypotension, coincident with the lowest maternal blood pressures. Maternal plasma renin concentration (PRC) had risen significantly by 30 min (P less than 0.02), reaching a maximum at approximately 90 min. Maternal plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations both fell initially (P less than 0.05) but were almost at basal levels by the end of the experiment. Foetal plasma renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations were unchanged throughout the experiment. Peak values of enaprilic acid, the active principle, were recorded in maternal plasma 65-90 min after administration of 1 mg kg-1, and 25-30 min after the administration of 2 mg kg-1. A trace amount of the active principle was recorded in the foetal plasma of one lamb, whose mother had been given the higher dose. None was recorded in the plasma from three other lambs. Maternal plasma ACE concentrations fell by an average of 84%; in 4 of the 6 ewes in which concentrations were measured they were undetectable after treatment. Foetal plasma ACE concentrations were unchanged throughout. Enalapril at 1 mg kg-1 thus exerts a depressor effect on the pregnant ewe which is probably related to its blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Both direct measurement of the drug and foetal observation suggest that it does not cross the sheep placenta at this dose. This is consistent with its failure to cross the blood-brain barrier. Foetal effects were noted at 2 mg kg-1, and there was an unexpected foetal death in this group.", 
    "235": "Teprotide, a nonapeptide isolated from the venom of a Brazilian pit viper, Bothrops jararaca, was the first angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to be discovered and tested. It was found to be an effective, non-toxic antihypertensive agent as well as an afterload-reducing agent for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The primary activity of teprotide resulted from blockade of the angiotensin I converting enzyme--the pivotal step in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and consequent reductions in angiotensin II levels. There was limited clinical testing for teprotide because of: its scarcity; the need for parenteral administration; and the subsequent discovery and synthesis of captopril, the first orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Captopril is the prototype oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and has been extensively studied since the initiation of formal studies in 1976. Perhaps one of the most closely researched drugs in modern times, the experience with captopril now includes more than 12,000 patients studied in formalized trials and over 4,000,000 patients treated world-wide by physicians for hypertension and congestive heart failure. Enalapril (MK421) is the first of what appears to be a growing number of analogues which are structurally and pharmacodynamically different from captopril; yet, they possess the same capacity for inhibiting the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme. The side effect profile of enalapril (and presumably future) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors appears to be similar to captopril, though clearly more experience is needed with newer agents. The initial use of captopril was troubled by a relatively high incidence of side effects which will form the focus of this discussion. Partially the result of incomplete pharmacokinetic information, captopril was administered in early studies at dosages now recognised to be far in excess of those necessary for drug action. In addition, dosages were given without regard for deficiencies of renal function, now known to be the main excretory route of captopril. The population of those patients studied frequently had chronic, treatment-resistant hypertension, often associated with concomitant end-organ disease (especially renal disease); and many additional factors further complicating the clinical setting, e.g. a relatively high incidence of collagen vascular disease and immunosuppressive treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "236": "Prostacyclin (PGI2) generation has been known to be regulated by several endogenous vasoactive substances, and in this study the relationship between angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) related substances and PGI2 generation was investigated using cultured human vascular endothelial cells. Addition of angiotensin I (AI) or bradykinin (BK) enhanced PGI2 generation and increased the level of ACE activity in the culture medium, while the addition of ACE inhibitor (captopril) caused a dose dependent suppression of PGI2 generation and ACE activity. The enhancement of PGI2 generation induced by AI or BK was not affected by pretreatment with captopril, and angiotensin II (AII) did not show any effect on either PGI2 generation or ACE activity. Through these experimental results, the conversion of AI to AII by ACE was considered not to cause the enhancement of PGI2 generation. Captopril solely inhibited PGI2 generation and the reported hypothesis that captopril enhances PGI2 generation by the accumulation of AI or BK via inhibition of ACE was not confirmed in this experimental system. Rather, it is proposed that AI or BK induced PGI2 generation may be regulated by the increased breakdown of AI or BK, as an autoregulation mechanism, that is derived from increased ACE activity by AI or BK.", 
    "237": "The in vitro and in vivo effects of naloxone (NAL) and endogenous opioids namely methionine and leucine enkephalins (MET-ENK, LEU-ENK) and beta-endorphin (BETA-END) on the brain and lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities were investigated. All three peptides dose -dependently inhibited ACE activity in vitro except 10(-5) M concentration of BETA-END which increased the lung ACE activity. NAL which intensified the in vitro inhibitory effect of the used opioids showed an antagonistic effect on the in vivo suppressive effect of BETA-END on both brain and lung ACE activities whereas it had neither antagonistic nor synergistic effect on the in vivo inhibiting effect of MET-ENK and LEU-ENK on the lung ACE activity. The results were consistent with those obtained by using morphine and NAL. As a result the possible contributory action of the excessively released endogenous opioids to overcome shock via their inhibiting effect on ACE was discussed.", 
    "238": "Enalapril, a potent long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was prescribed either alone (n = 9) or in combination (n = 20) with hydrochlorothiazide for 96 weeks in essential hypertensive subjects. Blood pressure was well controlled following both monotherapy or combination therapy. Plasma renin activity was stimulated in all subjects; plasma aldosterone concentration was stimulated only in subjects receiving combination therapy. Glomerular filtration rate (assessed by inulin clearance) was unchanged in subjects with initial clearances greater than 80 ml/min/1.73 m2 but was significantly improved (55%) following either form of therapy in subjects with initial clearances less than or equal to 80 ml/min/1.73 m2. Neither monotherapy nor combination therapy adversely affected 24-hour urinary protein excretion, sodium excretion, or body fluid composition. These results suggest that enalapril, either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, is effective therapy for mild to moderate hypertension. There are no adverse effect on renal function; indeed, enalapril has the capability of improving renal function in those subjects whose renal function was initially impaired from long-standing hypertension.", 
    "239": "Effects of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, N-[3-(N-cyclohexanecarbonyl-D-alanylthio)-2-methylpropanoyl] -L-proline calcium (MC-838), on the systemic and coronary circulation were evaluated in anesthetized dogs, and the effects were compared with those of captopril. Administration of MC-838 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a gradual and dose-dependent decline in aortic pressure associated with no marked changes in coronary blood flow, heart rate and LVdP/dt. Captopril (0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) also caused a dose-related decrease in aortic pressure, but the significant hypotension appeared more rapidly than that of MC-838. Both MC-838 and captopril inhibited selectively the pressor response to angiotensin I in a dose-related manner. The doses of MC-838 and captopril to lower mean aortic pressure by 10 mmHg from the pre-drug value were 2.8 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively; those of these drugs to cause 50% inhibition of angiotensin I-pressor response were 1.0 mg/kg and 0.04 mg/kg, respectively. When administration of MC-838 (3.0 mg/kg) was repeated three times at a 30 min-interval, the second and third injections caused no additional hypotension, while each of the repeated injections of captopril (0.3 mg/kg) produced significant hypotension. These results indicate that MC-838 inhibits angiotension I-conversion and decreases systemic blood pressure more slowly and persistently than captopril in anesthetized dogs.", 
    "240": "A marked species difference was observed both in vitro and in vivo in the activity of SA446, an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), as compared with that of captopril in five different animal species. The activity of SA446 in vitro in inhibiting plasma ACE correlated with the activity in vivo as determined by inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I (AI). SA446 was more potent as an inhibitor of AI response in dogs, cats and rabbits than in guinea pigs and rats. Furthermore, ACE activity in whole blood in vivo was inhibited by SA446, and the activity of SA446 was also more potent in dogs than in rats. The concentration of SA446 in the ultrafiltrate of blood (free form) was significantly higher in dogs than in rats, while no difference was observed in level of SA446 in the whole blood (free and protein-bound form) between these two species after intravenous injection. The binding rate of SA446 to plasma protein of rats in vitro was more than twice as high as that of dogs. These results suggest that the difference in the protein binding rate of SA446 is reflected in ultrafiltrate level and is one of the important components in defining the species difference in SA446 action.", 
    "241": "Enalapril maleate is an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. It lowers peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate. Enalapril 10 to 40 mg/day administered either once or twice daily is effective in lowering blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension, and shows similar efficacy to usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide, beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol and metoprolol) and captopril. Most patients achieve adequate blood pressure control on enalapril alone or with hydrochlorothiazide. In patients with severe congestive heart failure resistant to conventional therapy, enalapril improves cardiac performance by a reduction in both preload and afterload, and improves clinical status long term. Enalapril appears to be well tolerated, with few serious adverse effects being reported. It does not induce the bradycardia associated with beta-blockers or the adverse effects of diuretics on some laboratory values. In fact, the hypokalaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the addition of enalapril. The incidence of the main (but rare) side effects of hypotension in hypovolaemic patients and reduced renal function in certain patients with renovascular hypertension, which are also seen with captopril, might be reduced by careful dosage titration, discontinuation of diuretics, and monitoring of at-risk patients. Thus, enalapril is a particularly worthwhile addition to the antihypertensive armamentarium, as an alternative for treatment of all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension. It also shows promise in the treatment of congestive heart failure.", 
    "242": "The inhibitory effects of the analgesic neuropeptides kyotorphin (Tyr-Arg) and neo-kyotorphin (Thr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Arg) on enkephalin-degrading enzymes were studied. The enzyme used were aminopeptidase (AP), dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPP), enkephalinase-A (ENK-A), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which were prepared from the monkey brain membrane fraction. Kyotorphin inhibited only DPP (IC50, 18 microM), and the mode of inhibition was non-competitive (Ki, 6 microM). Neo-kyotorphin inhibited AP, DPP, and ACE with IC50 values of 131, 306, and 200 microM, respectively, but the inhibition of the enzyme activities were not effective. The selective inhibition by kyotorphin suggested that kyotorphin might protect the released Met-enkephalin against enzymatic degradation by DPP. Thus, kyotorphin may not only induce the release of Met-enkephalin but also stabilize the released neuropeptide.", 
    "243": "A novel inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), named K-4, was isolated from the culture broth of Actinomadura spiculosospora nov. sp. K-4. The K-4 was an oligopeptide containing L-phenylalanine with (R)-1-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylphosphonic acid as the C-terminal residue. The compound proved to be a specific and reversible inhibitor of ACE with the inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.18 microM, and inhibited ACE non-competitively by use of hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) as a substrate. When administrated intravenously to rats, K-4 inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I.", 
    "244": "Ten groups of New Zealand white rabbits were used to study the effects of mild, chronic two-kidney, one-clip hypertension (HT) and long-term antihypertensive therapy on atherogenesis. Five groups were fed a normal diet (ND) over the 8-month study period; 2 groups, one of which was given enalapril, remained normotensive (NT) throughout the study. Of the 3 HT groups, one was hypertensive for 7 months; the blood pressures of the other groups were normalized after 2 months with enalapril, or by removal of the clipped kidney. The other 5 groups were similar except that they were fed at 0.1% cholesterol diet (CD). The results showed that: neither mild chronic HT nor abrupt, short-term HT exacerbated atherogenesis in the CD-animals; although fibromuscular vascular lesions were present in the aorta of normal-diet, HT animals no atheroma was observed; enalapril therapy had no effect on atherogenesis; enalapril therapy reduced the total weight and the cholesterol and triglyceride content of the aorta of the ND groups regardless of blood pressure history; the aortic triglyceride content, but not the cholesterol content, of the CD group, was reduced by enalapril; and although heart size was unaffected by either diet or blood pressure levels, the mitochondria volume per unit volume of the left ventricle was reduced in both NT-ND and HT-CD groups treated with enalapril.", 
    "245": "In a single, ascending-dose tolerance study, nine healthy volunteers were given oral pentopril 50 to 750 mg (CGS 13945) in groups of three each. Disposition characteristics of pentopril and its active metabolite (CGS 13934) were determined using plasma concentration and urinary excretion data. The drug was absorbed rapidly following zero-order kinetics. The drug has an apparent volume of distribution of 0.83 L/kg and an oral clearance of about 0.79 L/hr/kg. Urinary excretions, calculated after 125- and 250-mg doses, showed a dose proportional urinary recovery of 21% (+/- 5%) for pentopril and 40% (+/- 5%) for CGS 13934. In the multiple-dose study of 125 mg orally q12h in six healthy subjects, the plasma concentrations for both drug and metabolite showed no appreciable accumulation of either compound, which was expected from their short pharmacokinetic half-lives (pentopril, less than 1 hr; CGS 13934, approximately 2 hr). In a separate pharmacodynamic study, drug and metabolite concentrations were evaluated against angiotensin-I (AI)-induced changes in blood pressure and plasma angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) activity in healthy volunteers after single oral doses (range, 10-500 mg). The pharmacodynamic half-life for plasma ACE inhibition increased with the dose (10 mg, 1.5 hr; 500 mg, 9.8 hr). There was a close relationship between the plasma level of the metabolite and the inhibition of plasma ACE activity and AI-induced pressor response. A hyperbolic function adequately described the dependence of plasma ACE activity on plasma metabolite concentration with a concentration at half-maximal inhibition of 53 ng/mL.", 
    "246": "Enalapril maleate is a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor marketed in the U.S. by Merck Sharp and Dohme. It has been demonstrated to actively interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This is reflected by both hemodynamic (decreased blood pressure) and humoral (increased plasma renin, angiotensin I, and decreased angiotensin II) responses to enalapril therapy. Activity in the kallikrein-bradykinin system is still controversial. Enalapril maleate is a prodrug which is quickly absorbed, hydrolyzed by the liver to the active metabolite enalaprilic acid, and excreted 33 percent in the bile and 61 percent in the urine. The therapeutic dosage range is 10-40 mg/d, maximum of 40 mg, given once or twice daily. The onset and duration of action are dose related. Vertigo and headache have been the most commonly reported side effects. Clinical comparison of enalapril to hydrochlorothiazide, beta-adrenergic blockers, and captopril find it efficacious in the treatment of essential hypertension. Efficacy in treating congestive heart failure and hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis has also been demonstrated for both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The overall efficacy and safety of enalapril and captopril appear equivalent when used at low doses in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "247": "The neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11, also designated enkephalinase, has been visualized by in vitro autoradiography using the tritiated inhibitor [3H]-N-[(2RS)-3-hydroxyaminocarbonyl-2-benzyl-1-oxopropyl] glycine, ([3H]HACBO-Gly). Specific binding of [3H]HACBO-Gly (Kd = 0.4 +/- 0.05 nM) corresponding to 85% of the total binding to brain slices was inhibited by 1 microM thiorphan, a selective inhibitor of enkephalinase, but remained unchanged in the presence of captopril, a selective inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Very high levels of [3H]HACBO-Gly binding were found in the choroid plexus and the substantia nigra. High levels were present in the caudate putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. Moderate densities were found in parts of the amygdala, the periaqueductal gray matter, the interpeduncular nucleus, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum. The distribution of enkephalinase was compared to that of mu and delta opioid receptors, selectively labeled with [3H]Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-glycinol and [3H]Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr, respectively. In the caudate putamen, [3H]HACBO-Gly binding overlapped the clustered mu sites but appeared more closely related to the diffusely distributed delta sites. High levels of enkephalinase and mu opioid binding sites were present at the level of the periaqueductal gray matter and in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord, regions where only sparse delta opioid receptors could be detected. The association of enkephalinase with delta and mu opioid receptors in these areas is consistent with the observed role of the enzyme in regulating the effects of opioid peptides in striatal dopamine release and analgesia, respectively. Except for the choroid plexus and the cerebellum, the close similarity observed in numerous rat brain areas between the distribution of enkephalinase and that of mu and/or delta opioid binding sites could account for most of the pharmacological effects elicited by enkephalinase inhibitors.", 
    "248": "Surgical procedures necessitating clamping of the thoracic aorta are associated with a high incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction. Plasma renin activity is elevated during and after thoracic aortic occlusion in animals. The pathophysiology of the renal dysfunction may involve the renin-angiotensin system. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system was studied in a canine model during occlusion of the thoracic aorta. Saralasin, a competitive blocker of angiotensin II, and the converting enzyme inhibitor MK422 were studied. Sixteen animals were separated into three treatment groups: control (five animals), saralasin (five), and MK422 (six). All dogs underwent clamping of the thoracic aorta for 60 minutes. In control animals, plasma renin activity increased from 0.16 +/- 0.04 to 6.41 +/- 1.57 ng/ml/hr at 30 minutes after thoracic aortic occlusion (p less than 0.05). Thirty minutes after cross-clamp release, plasma renin activity remained 10 times greater than baseline, 1.47 +/- 0.20 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.05). Renal blood flow was measured with 15 micron microspheres before, during, and after thoracic clamping. In control animals, renal cortical blood flow decreased during cross-clamping and remained below baseline after clamp release: baseline, 7.05 +/- 0.98 ml/gm/min (standard error of the mean); 30 min after clamp release, 3.77 +/- 0.43 ml/gm/min (standard error of the mean) (p less than 0.05). In the MK422 group, renal cortical blood flows returned to baseline after cross-clamp release: baseline, 6.38 +/- 0.49 ml/gm/min; 30 minutes after clamp release, 7.30 +/- 1.6 ml/gm/min. Infusion of MK422 after placement of the thoracic aortic cross-clamp resulted in normal renal blood flow after clamp release. This protective effect was not seen with saralasin. The resumption of normal renal cortical blood flow after the administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor MK422 suggests that elevated plasma renin activity may contribute to renal dysfunction after thoracic aortic occlusion.", 
    "249": "The synthesis of 1-[(2-mercaptocyclopentyl)carbonyl]-L-prolines, 1-[(2-mercaptocyclobutyl)carbonyl]-L-prolines and related benzoyl derivatives as pure isomers is described. The abilities of all the compounds to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro and in vivo and to lower the systolic blood pressure in renal hypertensive dogs were determined. Three of them, namely 1-[[2-(benzoylthio)cyclopentyl]carbonyl]-L-proline (10f(R,S], 1-[(2-mercaptocyclopentyl)carbonyl]-L-proline (10g(R,S], and 1-[[2-(benzoylthio)cyclobutyl]carbonyl]-L-proline (16f(R,S], were found to be as potent as captopril in reducing blood pressure. The influence of chirality and ring size on the ACE inhibition is described.", 
    "250": "To compare the antihypertensive and humoral effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril, 20 patients with essential hypertension, not receiving treatment for 2 weeks and consuming a prescribed sodium ion intake, were randomly assigned to two parallel, double-blind treatment groups with stratification based on race and untreated seated diastolic blood pressure. These groups received a placebo (day -1) followed by either captopril, 200 mg every 12 hours (n = 9), or enalapril maleate, 20 mg every 12 hours (n = 11), alone (days 1 to 14) and then with hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg every 12 hours (days 16 to 28). Captopril and enalapril were coadministered alone (day 15) and with hydrochlorothiazide (day 29) to assess whether further decreases in blood pressure would occur. Captopril and enalapril alone caused comparable decreases (p less than 0.05) in the mean 12 hour time-averaged seated diastolic blood pressure from values on day -1 (placebo), on day 1 (11 and 9 mm Hg, respectively) and day 14 (8 and 7 mm Hg, respectively). The addition of hydrochlorothiazide further decreased (p less than 0.05) blood pressure in each group (7 and 8 mm Hg, respectively) from values on day 14. Combined use of captopril and enalapril did not result in further reduction. Coupled with the comparable changes observed in each treatment group in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration, these data support the view that captopril and enalapril have similar antihypertensive effects and mechanisms.", 
    "251": "To assess the contribution of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal hemodynamics to acute renal sodium handling in essential hypertension we studied 21 subjects who had essential hypertension (16 with normal renin, 5 with low renin) and 9 normal subjects. All were in balance on a 10 mEq sodium intake before receiving a small sodium load, 60 mEq intravenously over 1 hour. Hypertensive subjects with low renin showed the anticipated exaggerated natriuresis, which was transient and occurred without a rise in blood pressure. Natriuresis in hypertensive subjects with normal renin was either normal or blunted; delayed sodium excretion occurred in a subset, along with delayed suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by the saline load. Neither renal plasma flow nor glomerular filtration rate changed during the saline load. After 72 hours of converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril, renal plasma flow increased substantially more in the subjects with a blunted renin response and their natriuretic response to the sodium load returned to normal. These results indicate that when prior sodium intake is controlled, large sodium loads are avoided, and low renin hypertension is removed as a confounding variable, blunted rather than exaggerated natriuresis is the common feature of essential hypertension. This abnormality is reversed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, perhaps because of converting enzyme inhibition-induced renal vasodilatation.", 
    "252": "Many of the adverse reactions produced by penicillamine and other compounds with an active sulfhydryl group form a distinctive pattern when viewed as a class. Alterations in taste perception, mucocutaneous lesions, proteinuria due to immune-complex membranous glomerulopathy, and pemphigus are adverse reactions that have been encountered with all of the compounds discussed herein. Hematologic reactions such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occur rarely and with variable frequency. The angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor captopril has an active sulfhydryl group. When it was first given in high doses to patients with severe hypertension, adverse effects similar in pattern to those just outlined were reported. With reduced doses and more careful patient selection, the more serious reactions are no longer found, but disturbances of taste perception, rash, and oral mucosal ulcers are still encountered.", 
    "253": "We have investigated the effect of amastatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, and captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the antinociceptive activity induced by intracerebroventricular administration of dermorphin, a heptapeptide. In addition, the potency of dermorphin was compared with that of one of its metabolites, N-terminal tetrapeptide (Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Gly), by using the tail pressure test. The antinociceptive activity induced by dermorphin was not potentiated by simultaneous administration of amastatin or captopril. However, there was potentiation when dermorphin was combined with both peptidase inhibitors. Moreover, the N-terminal tetrapeptide was 84 times less potent than its parent heptapeptide when administered intracerebroventricularly. The results suggest that the cleavage of Tyr1-D-Ala2 and Gly4-Tyr5 bonds by brain endopeptidase modulates dermorphin-induced antinociceptive activity.", 
    "254": "The purpose of this investigation was to examine the pathway of substance P (SP) and neurotensin (NT) catabolism in the gastric wall of the rat and identify some of the enzymes involved. Under anaesthesia an infusion catheter and a bundle of dialysis fibres were implanted into the stomach wall of the rat. Experiments commenced on conscious rats 2 days after surgery. In control experiments [3H]-SP(Pro-2,4) or [3H]-NT(Tyr-3,11) were injected into gastric tissues through the catheter and catabolites were collected in the dialysis fibres and separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. In other studies captopril, MK422 (inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme) or phosphoramidon (an inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.11, 'enkephalinase') were injected into gastric tissues before the peptide label. SP1-11 was degraded to mainly SP1-2, SP3-4 with some SP1-6, SP1-7 and SP1-8. Catabolism was partially but significantly (5% level) inhibited by MK422 and captopril, but not by phosphoramidon. NT1-13 was degraded to NT1-8, NT9-13, NT1-11 and NT1-12. NT catabolism was partially but significantly (5% level) inhibited by MK422. It is concluded that an enzyme resembling angiotensin converting enzyme is involved in the initial stages of SP and NT catabolism in the rat stomach. The involvement of other peptidases cannot be excluded because inhibition of breakdown was not complete.", 
    "255": "The effects of a new converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril (5 mg/kg p.o. q.d. for 8 days), on systemic and regional hemodynamics, as well as its interferences with the sympathetic nervous system at the cardiovascular level, were investigated in nonbinephrectomized and in binephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Perindopril abolished plasma converting enzyme activity and lowered arterial blood pressure (BP) without affecting heart rate. Cardiac index (microspheres) was not drug affected; thus, the reduction in BP was due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance which was shown to be homogenous, since all investigated vascular resistances were reduced to the same extent. In nonbinephrectomized, pithed SHRs, perindopril decreased BP and renal and hindlimb vascular resistances (pulsed Doppler). In addition, perindopril exerted a sympathoinhibitory effect as evidenced by (a) a reduction in the systemic vasopressor and regional vasoconstrictor responses to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, cirazoline, and especially to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14.304; and (b) a decrease in the systemic pressor and in the hindlimb vasoconstrictor responses to spinal cord stimulation. In binephrectomized, pithed SHRs, perindopril no longer decreased BP; however, whereas its sympathoinhibitory effect versus alpha-adrenoceptor agonists was abolished, that versus spinal cord stimulation persisted. These results indicate that (a) perindopril lowers BP in SHRs by a renal-dependent mechanism; (b) perindopril exerts in SHRs a sympathoinhibitory effect versus alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and spinal cord stimulation; (c) the sympathoinhibitory effect of perindopril versus alpha-adrenoceptor agonists is postjunctional and kidney dependent; and (d) the sympathoinhibitory effect of perindopril versus spinal cord stimulation is possibly prejunctional in its mechanism and does not require the presence of the kidneys.", 
    "256": "The maximal increases in heart rate produced by intravenous xamoterol in anaesthetized cats and rats are less than that of (-)-isoprenaline. In cats, blood pressure was slightly raised, while in rats, supramaximal cardiac-stimulant doses produced reductions in blood pressure. In anaesthetized guinea pigs, cardiac-stimulant effects of xamoterol were evident only after treatment with hexamethonium. In all three species cardiovascular responses to xamoterol were antagonized by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Thus, xamoterol is a partial agonist which displays beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity. In cats, infusions of xamoterol elicited beta-adrenoceptor-mediated increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output, while calculated total peripheral resistance was little affected and, unexpectedly, stroke volume was reduced. These cardiovascular effects were unaffected by hexamethonium or captopril. Both xamoterol and (-)-isoprenaline elevated left ventricular dP/dtmax and reduced central venous pressure. When cat heart rate was paced over a range (175-250 beats/min) corresponding to the beta-receptor-mediated chronotropic effects, an inverse relationship between rate and stroke volume was observed. The rate-induced reduction in stroke volume offers the best explanation for the decrease in stroke volume produced by xamoterol. In general, the effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists on stroke volume in the anaesthetized cat appear to represent a balance between a rate-related reduction and a drug-induced elevation of this parameter.", 
    "257": "The novel prodrug-converting-enzyme (CE) inhibitor perindopril (S9490-3) diacid was found to be as potent as ramipril (Hoe498) diacid and more potent than enalapril (MK421) diacid and captopril against rat plasma CE in vitro (IC50 values were 3 X 10(-9), 2 X 10(-9), 1 X 10(-8), and 6 X 10(-8) mol/L, respectively). Four-week oral treatment with perindopril (0.1, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) lowered blood pressure (BP) dose-dependently with a threshold dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day and normalization of BP following doses between 1-3 mg/kg/day. Plasma CE was inhibited, angiogensinogen lowered, plasma renin concentration (PRC) and angiotensin I (ANGI) increased, all dose-dependently. CE was also inhibited in kidney, aortic wall, heart, lung, hypophysis, and brain cortex. Upon drug withdrawal, the BP depressant effect outlasted the effects on the plasma renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by more than a week. Perindopril, ramipril (both 1 mg/kg/day), and enalapril (30 mg/kg/day) showed equal antihypertensive actions in SHRSP, although their effects on parameters of the RAS in plasma were different. Our data reveal perindopril to be a potent antihypertensive drug. The findings are consistent with the view that the antihypertensive actions of CE inhibitors cannot be directly related to inhibition of the RAS in the plasma. Local interference with the RAS in tissue appears to be an additional factor involved.", 
    "258": "Vasodilators are a group of drugs with various degrees of arteriolar or venous dilatation used in the treatment of congestive heart failure when symptoms persist after digoxin and diuretic therapy. Nitrates and captopril provide the most consistent improvement in symptoms. Reduced mortality rates in congestive heart failure with vasodilator therapy has not been demonstrated, and prediction of clinical response to therapy is difficult.", 
    "259": "Chronic heart failure results from two processes, i.e., myocardial and congestive failure. Myocardial failure is clinically silent, most often progresses slowly, and is documented by a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Multiple etiologic factors include systolic and diastolic overloads, myocardial necrosis and/or ischemia, and, perhaps, microvascular spasm. Myocardial failure ultimately leads to exaggerated neurohumoral compensatory mechanisms and derangements of the peripheral circulation, which are the hallmarks of congestive heart failure. At that stage of the syndrome, patients have symptoms, initially, with exercise and, later, at rest. Objective assessment of severity is afforded by determination of maximal oxygen uptake during maximal exercise testing. When congestive heart failure supervenes, the prognosis is poor. Current medical therapy is aimed at improving the derangements of the peripheral circulation, which relieves the symptoms but leaves the primary myocardial process unaffected. The goal of future therapy is to intervene at an earlier stage of the syndrome to halt or even partially reverse the myocardial failure.", 
    "260": "The demonstration that antihypertensive drug treatment reduces mortality and morbidity in persons with mild hypertension has extended the indications for treatment. Verapamil, nitrendipine, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are equally effective in reducing blood pressure. The choice of which drug to use depends on the presence or absence of specific contraindications and the occurrence of adverse effects in the individual patient.", 
    "261": "The present investigation was undertaken to elucidate the possible interplay between the circulating kinin(s) and the renin angiotensin axis in hyperthyroidism. The responsiveness of plasma aldosterone (p-Ald), kinin (p-BK), plasma renin activity (PRA) and serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACEA) to infusion of angiotensin II at a dose of 4, 8 and 16 ng/kg.min. was asessed in 15 hyperthyroid patients and 10 euthyroid controls. There was impaired angiotensin II induced response of blood pressure in hyperthyroid patients, and basal concentrations of p-Ald were 7.7 +/- 3.8 ng/dl in euthyroid controls and 12.6 +/- 3.1 ng/dl in hyperthyroid patients (p less than 0.05). As compared to the euthyroid controls, the hyperthyroid patients showed a reduced response of plasma aldosterone to angiotensin II infusion. Angiotensin II infusion increased p-BK from basal levels of 19.1 +/- 8.2 pg/ml to 31.0 +/- 7.8 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) only in hyperthyroid patients and did not increase ACEA in either group. Next, the effects of a single administration of captopril (50 mg p.o.) on blood pressure and p-BK in hyperthyroid patients and euthyroid controls were studied. In the two groups blood pressure was not changed by captopril, but p-BK increased significantly. The present results do not support the view that there may be a direct linkage between the kallikrein kinin system and the renin angiotensin axis mediated by kininase II or angiotensin converting enzyme in human peripheral blood. Also it is unlikely that kinin may play a role in the mechanism of reduced responsiveness of aldosterone and blood pressure to angiotensin II in hyperthyroidism.", 
    "262": "Sodium loading significantly attenuated the antihypertensive potency of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, SA446, in 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats, but the potency of SA446 remained unchanged in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Basal levels of plasma renin activity of both types of hypertensive rats were suppressed by sodium loading. From these results, it appeared that a different mechanism was involved in the maintenance of hypertension in 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats. It also appeared that the mechanism of the antihypertensive action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was not explainable only by the suppression of the plasma renin-angiotensin system.",

    "264": "The present study investigates the effectiveness of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) on cardiac performance of patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II). Outpatients (n = 12) were treated with enalapril, 5 to 10 mg twice daily, in addition to stable doses of digitalis and diuretic drugs. Before and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment a treadmill exercise test and echocardiography were performed. Maximal oxygen uptake and exercise tolerance increased significantly and mean arterial pressure at rest and on exertion decreased significantly. Heart rate did not change. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter decreased significantly. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity was reduced to nearly 0; plasma renin concentration, which was already elevated, increased further. Plasma norepinephrine levels did not change significantly. Treatment was tolerated well by all patients. CEI decreased preload and afterload, suggesting that they might have had an inappropriately elevated arteriolar and venous tone owing to a moderately stimulated renin angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system. These conditions may lead to further deterioration of cardiac performance. By means of CEI one may be able to interrupt these pathogenetic mechanisms, relieving the already damaged heart from inappropriate elevations of preload and afterload and delaying or even preventing further deterioration of cardiac performance.", 
    "265": "Investigation of preventive measures for hypertension and atherosclerosis is a geriatric medicine priority. While the causes of both isolated systolic hypertension and conventional systolic and diastolic hypertension in the elderly are well defined, the benefits of lowering blood pressure are not. Evidence to support the treatment of symptomatic hypertension is convincing for men 60 years of age; it is not for women in this age group. The need to treat hypertension, particularly isolated systolic hypertension in patients above 75 years old, is still not resolved. Isolated systolic hypertension in older patients is at least as strong a risk factor for cardiovascular disease as is diastolic hypertension. Ongoing trials may answer these questions; in the meantime, drug therapy in this group will vary widely. The elderly hypertensive is more likely than the younger hypertensive to have other diseases; diagnosis of these disorders is crucial. Hypertension arising de novo late in life warrants a search for underlying and possibly remedial causes. Antihypertensive drug therapy to relieve symptoms is difficult to justify, because most elderly hypertensive patients are asymptomatic; however, it has been shown to delay morbid and fatal complications of hypertension. Appropriate therapy for the elderly hypertensive must be individualized and should be associated with few or no side effects. The thiazides are the preferred diuretics for long-term treatment of hypertension in the elderly. Beta blockers are attractive because they are cardioprotective, counter the end organ effect of catecholamines and reduce angina; however, some decrease cardiac output, increase peripheral resistance, decrease renal blood flow and cause fatigue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "266": "The role of the brain renin-angiotensin system in mediating the peripheral hormone response to acute hemorrhagic stress (15 ml/kg over 10 min) was studied in 6 sheep during an intracerebroventricular infusion (2.8 micrograms/min) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. When compared with control experiments the plasma ACTH and vasopressin (AVP) response to hemorrhage was markedly reduced and delayed during icv captopril, which did not affect the response of plasma angiotensin II (AII). These results suggest that the normal and rapid response in ACTH and AVP secretion accompanying hemorrhagic stress is dependent on increased brain production of AII.", 
    "267": "Incubation of human plasma at 37 degrees C for several hours leads to the formation of a non-dialysable vasopressor substance termed the active pressor principle. Some of the chemical and physical natures of active pressor principle were investigated in anesthetized and ganglion blocked rats. It was found to have properties characteristic of protein. The substance was crudely purified to about 25-fold in alcoholic trichloroacetic acid solution after placing the plasma in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes (\"active fraction\"). After treatment of the vasoactive plasma or \"active fraction\" with Pronase, the pressor activity was almost abolished. The molecular weight of this fraction as determined by gel filtration was about 68,000. With addition of diisopropyl fluorophosphate before incubation of the plasma, no vasopressor substance was generated. After treatment of the rat with captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, the pressor effect of incubated plasma was not inhibited. These findings suggest that a vasoactive protein, which is clearly different from renin, is generated during simple incubation of plasma, and that a serine protease is involved in the formation of this substance.", 
    "268": "SA446 [(2R, 4R)-2-(o-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(3-mercaptopropionyl)-4- thiazolidinecarboxylic acid] (30 mg/kg/day), an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lowered significantly indirect systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats (RHR) by consecutive oral administration over a 14 week period. Daily oral dosing of hydralazine (2 mg/kg/day) for 14 weeks had little or no effect on SBP, but potentiated the antihypertensive effect of SA446. One to two weeks after discontinuation of the drugs, SBP in SA446 and the combination groups returned to the control level. Survival rates were 64%, 30% in the control and hydralazine group, respectively, but no death was observed in the SA446 group and the combination group throughout the administration period. Twenty-four hour urine volume and water intake tended to increase in the hydralazine group through the administration period, but increased apparently in the SA446 group and the combination group after discontinuation of the drugs. Daily oral dosing of SA446 (45 mg/kg/day) for over 16 weeks completely prevented the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Daily oral dosing of hydralazine (2 mg/kg/day) similarly prevented the development. The combined effect with SA446 and hydralazine on the development was also observed. SBP in the SA446 group and the combination group increased gradually after discontinuation of the drugs, but were maintained at a low level as compared with the control group 3 weeks after discontinuation, while hydralazine gave a rapid return. No influences were observed in 24 hr-urine volume and water intake during and after the administration period in SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "269": "In order to clarify the mechanism of the hypotensive action of captopril, the acute and chronic effects of this drug on the kallikrein-kinin and renin-angiotensin systems were investigated respectively in 14 and 19 patients with hypertension. To determine the acute effect, a dose of 50 mg of captopril was administered once orally. For the chronic effect, 75-300 mg of the drug was administered daily for 14 days. In observations of the acute effect, blood pressure decreased significantly at 30 min. and maximally at 60-180 min. after administration with no change in heart rate. Significant increases in blood kinin levels and plasma renin activity (PRA), and a decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels were also observed. A marked augmentation was also found in urinary kinin excretion, but not in urinary kallikrein excretion. Moreover, the changes in blood pressure significantly correlated negatively with basal PRA, basal plasma angiotensin II and the changes in blood kinin levels, and positively with the changes in plasma angiotensin II. In our study of the chronic effect of captopril, similar changes in blood kinin levels, PRA, plasma angiotensin II levels, blood pressure and heart rate to the acute effect study were observed. Significant correlations of the changes in blood pressure were found negatively with basal PRA, basal plasma angiotensin II levels and the changes in blood kinin levels and positively with the changes in plasma angiotensin II levels. In addition, significant increases in urine volume and urinary sodium excretion occurred following administration of captopril for 14 days, and both increases negatively correlated with the changes in blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "270": "The influence of counter irritation by turpentine (0.2 ml) on zymosan- and carrageenan-oedemas was investigated in the rat. Zymosan-oedema was inhibited by mepyramine and methysergide and by leucopenia. It was not modified by captopril and developed normally in kininogendeficient Brown Norway rats. Leucocytes and mast cell amines but not kinins are thus involved in zymosan-oedema. The last phase of this reaction was inhibited by counter irritation alone, but the odema was largely depressed by counter irritation in rats pretreated with mepyramine and methysergide. Carrageenan-oedema was increased by kininase inhibitors and inhibited by leucopenia in normal rats. This inflammatory reaction had a small developement and was not increased by kininase inhibitors in kininogen-deficient BN rats. Leucocytes and kinins participate in the developement of this inflammatory reaction in normal rats while kinins are lacking in deficient rats. Counter irritation depressed carrageenan-oedema in deficient Brown Norway rats and suppressed the potentiating effect of kininase inhibitors in normal rats. Carrageenan oedema was nearly abolished in turpentine-treated leucopenic rats. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of counter irritation by turpentine could depend on a reduction of leucocyte accumulation into zymosan-oedema and on a reduction of both kinin formation and of leucocyte accumulation into carrageenan-oedema. The significance of T-kininogen as acute phase reactant is discussed.", 
    "271": "Captopril lowered blood pressure in chloralose-anaesthetized rats and enhanced the depressor responses to metenkephalin and D-Ala-metenkephalinamide to the same extent. Since metenkephalin is a much better substrate than D-Ala-metenkephalinamide for dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase, some mechanism other than inhibition of this enzyme appears to be responsible for the enhancement by captopril of the responses to opioids. When the blood pressure had been lowered by haemorrhage, naloxone was no more effective than saline control in restoring blood pressure. However, when captopril was given after haemorrhage, the blood pressure was further lowered, and then naloxone produced a significant restoration. Hydralazine given after haemorrhage also caused a further lowering of blood pressure, then naloxone produced a lesser restoration of blood pressure than in haemorrhage plus captopril experiments. The results suggest that release of endogenous opioids may contribute to the fall in blood pressure upon bleeding.", 
    "272": "The effect of intravenous (i.v.) captopril on mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) of anaesthetized normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats perfused i.v. with two doses of angiotensin II (ANG II; 2.9 and 5.8 pmol/kg per min) was studied to determine the role of the suppression of plasma ANG II in the hypotensive action of captopril. The reduction of MABP by captopril was attenuated in WKY and abolished in SHR by the highest dose of ANG II; it was unchanged in WKY and attenuated in SHR by the lowest dose of ANG II. The suppression of plasma ANG II thus explains a minor part of the acute reduction of MABP by captopril in WKY and a major part of this action in SHR. Plasma ANG II contributes to the maintenance of high blood pressure in SHR.", 
    "273": "Plasma renin (PRC) and angiotensin I (pANG I) and II (pANG II) concentrations were determined at renal vein catheterization in 38 hypertensive patients suspected of renal or renovascular aetiology. Veno-arterial differences in pANG I across the affected kidney in patients with lateralization of the renin secretion indicated release of angiotensin I (ANG I) in considerable amounts. Veno-arterial differences in pANG II of around zero indicated that generation and elimination of angiotensin II (ANG II) were equal in that kidney. Across the contralateral kidney the veno-arterial differences in PRC and pANG II were both close to zero, while negative differences in pANG II indicated the removal of ANG II. In patients without lateralization of the renin secretion the veno-arterial differences in pANG I were close to zero or positive, those of pANG II being close to zero or negative. In 14 of the 38 patients, data were obtained either during maintenance treatment with captopril or after a single dose of this converting enzyme inhibitor. Systemic PRC and pANG I values were extremely high and pANG II values low. The pANG I gradient across the affected kidney was further increased compared with pre-captopril levels, whereas the contralateral kidney still eliminated ANG I.", 
    "274": "The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition by captopril (CAP) on serum potassium (SK) changes was studied during a three-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) in recumbent and upright positions in 16 patients with drug-resistant hypertension. An elevation of SK in the upright posture occurred in the course of GTT during CAP treatment in 50% of the patients (Group I) even without consistent changes in baseline SK. In Group II a qualitatively normal glucose-induced hypokalemic response was obtained. Aldosterone was suppressed by CAP, predominantly in the upright position in Group I due to the significant interaction between the drug and posture. Significant inverse correlations were found in Group I between glucose-induced serum potassium changes and basal glomerular filtration rate. A similar correlation was found also with serum insulin in the whole patient material. It was concluded that the interplay of various factors, CAP, upright posture and impaired renal functions resulting in suppression of aldosterone and insulin played a role in the paradoxical glucose-induced serum potassium elevation.", 
    "275": "The inactivation of bradykinin on passage across the human foetal placental circulation was investigated in six full-term human placentas. The placentas were perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution and placenta perfusion pressure was recorded. Samples collected at the arterial inflow and at the venous effluent were assayed on the isolated guinea-pig ileum as an estimation of bradykinin activity. Bradykinin (100 ng ml-1) was infused through the foetal placental vessels before and during captopril 4 X 10(-7) M. Bradykinin produced a transient increase in placental vascular resistance that was not potentiated by captopril. Bradykinin activity was completely abolished after passage through the foetal placental circulation, and the inactivation was blocked by captopril. These data suggest that angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) might occur in the foetal placental vessels.", 
    "276": "We have proposed that sodium appetite is aroused by a synergy in the brain of angiotensin II and aldosterone. This hypothesis was tested with 1) chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of captopril, which blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, or 2) intracerebroventricular injection of eight-substituted analogues of angiotensin II, which block its receptors. Both treatments resulted in a suppression of the sodium appetite induced by sodium deficiency. The suppression was specific for the deficiency-induced appetite, because spontaneous ingestive behaviors were not changed nor was sodium excretion. In addition, the rats continued to express a sodium appetite aroused by pharmacological doses of deoxycorticosterone acetate when they received the highest dose of chronic intracerebroventricular captopril. These results offer compelling evidence for the idea that angiotensin II action in the brain is necessary for expression of sodium appetite.", 
    "277": "Late-pregnant (18-20 days) and virgin rats were studied under anesthesia or while awake to investigate the effect of acute angiotensin II (ANG II) inhibition (with saralasin or captopril) on mean arterial blood pressure (AP) and renal hemodynamics. ANG II inhibition had no effect on AP in either anesthetized or awake virgin rats. Saralasin produced no effect on renal hemodynamics although with captopril small increases in renal plasma flow rate (RPF) and decreases in renal vascular resistance (RVR) occurred in virgins. In anesthetized pregnant rats, ANG II inhibition evoked marked decreases in AP. In some rats receiving saralasin, AP was only mildly depressed and RVR fell, leading to increases in glomerular filtration rate and RPF. In others, saralasin produced large decreases in AP, and indices of renal function became unmeasurable because of near cessation of urine flow. All late-pregnant anesthetized rats receiving captopril showed increased RPF irrespective of the magnitude of the fall in AP. In awake pregnant rats no effect on AP was seen with ANG II inhibition. Saralasin had no effect on renal hemodynamics although with captopril a small increase in RPF was observed. These data indicate that the stress of acute surgery and anesthesia produces a dependence of AP on ANG II in the pregnant but not the virgin rat. Under normal pregnant (awake) conditions, however, ANG II inhibition has no net effect on AP.", 
    "278": "To evaluate the role of regional hemodynamics in mediating the long-term depressor effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, at a low dose (37.5 mg/day), for 2 weeks, its systemic, renal, and forearm circulatory actions were determined in 12 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After administration of captopril, there was a significant decline in mean blood pressure (average -12.1 +/- 1.9%) accompanied by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (-9.1 +/- 3.3%), but cardiac output did not change. Although forearm vascular resistance was not altered, renal vascular resistance decreased considerably (-17.1 +/- 5.0%). Moreover, there was a highly significant (r = 0.891) correlation between the changes in mean blood pressure and renal vascular resistance. Plasma renin activity increased after therapy as plasma aldosterone decreased, while plasma norepinephrine slightly increased. The change in renal vascular resistance significantly (r = -0.617) correlated with the pretreatment level of plasma renin activity. These findings suggest that suppression of the renin-angiotensin system in essential hypertension induces selective vasodilation in the renal vasculature, which may play an important role in the long-term antihypertensive effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor. This renal vasodilator action appears to be the feature that distinguishes the converting enzyme inhibitor from conventional vasodilator drugs.", 
    "279": "The effect of intravenous captopril was studied in 26 patients with severe chronic heart failure. Fourteen patients received a 25 mg intravenous bolus dose and 12 patients were given a series of incremental intravenous doses over the range 0.3125-45 mg. After the 25 mg bolus dose there was a rapid reduction in systemic vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure. The effect was greatest five minutes after the dose when cardiac output was increased by 20%. Mean right atrial pressure and pulmonary end diastolic pressure fell more slowly and reached their nadir 60 minutes after administration. Plasma free captopril concentration was significantly correlated with percentage reduction in systemic vascular resistance 15 minutes after the bolus injection, but was not correlated with either changes in right atrial or pulmonary artery pressures. With the series of incremental doses there was a progressive fall in systemic vascular resistance until a cumulative dose of 5.0 mg was reached; beyond this there was no further significant change. The rapid response to intravenous captopril indicates that it may be useful in the treatment of patients with severe heart failure who require intensive treatment. After intravenous injection of captopril haemodynamic responses in patients with heart failure were greatest at plasma concentrations of 100 g/ml to 150 ng/ml. This is considerably higher than the plasma free captopril concentrations found after conventional oral doses of captopril.", 
    "280": "The mechanisms causing high blood pressure in patients with Cushing's syndrome were investigated by measurements of humoral factors and pharmacological maneuvers. Twelve patients with adrenal adenomas were studied. The mean systolic and diastolic pressures of the patients were 171 +/- 28 and 109 +/- 15 mm Hg (+/- SEM), respectively, which were significantly higher than those of normal subjects. PRA, plasma renin concentration, plasma renin substrate, plasma cortisol, plasma aldosterone, urinary kallikrein, and urinary prostaglandin E2 were measured as the humoral factors. PC values were markedly elevated in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Among the components of the renin-angiotensin system, only plasma renin substrate was increased. Urinary kallikrein and prostaglandin E2 were decreased in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Oral administration of captopril lowered blood pressure, but infusion of an angiotensin II analog did not. Furthermore, the pressor responses to infusion of both norepinephrine and angiotensin II were increased. We conclude that blood pressure is elevated in patients with Cushing's syndrome because they have enhanced pressor responses to vasoactive substances, suppression of depressor systems, and some abnormalities of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "281": "In 27 patients undergoing ear, nose and throat surgery, the problem of post-hypotensive hypertension (rebound hypertension) following vasodilator-induced controlled hypotension was studied, together with prevention by the ACE inhibitor captopril. Hypotension was induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in seven patients (group 1) and by nitroglycerin (NTG) in ten patients (group 3). Ten patients (group 2) received 25 mg captopril given orally, together with the preanaesthetic medication, as well as SNP. The degree and duration of the decrease in blood pressure did not differ significantly between groups. After discontinuation of the respective vasodilators, blood pressure had increased to above prehypotensive levels in both group 1 (SNP) and group 3 (NTG) 30 min afterward and, to a more marked extent, 60 min afterward. In these groups plasma renin activity (PRA) increased continuously during the hypotensive period up to 11.4 +/- 2.4 and 19.5 +/- 4.5 ng/ml/h, respectively, and had not yet reached its prehypotensive value 60 min after discontinuation. In group 2 (captopril/SNP) there was no overshoot hypertension on discontinuation of SNP, and the average infusion rate of SNP was reduced. PRA was markedly higher than in groups 1 and 3 (peak level 27.9 +/- 6.5 ng/ml/h) due to inhibition of the feedback mechanism in the renin-angiotensin system. From the results it may be concluded that both SNP and NTG can cause rebound hypertension, the extent of which depends on the level of hypotension previously achieved and the infusion rate of the vasodilator. Pretreatment with captopril prevents the rebound and reduces the dosage of vasodilator required and, therefore, may be considered an alternative to the well-documented beta-adrenergic blockers.", 
    "282": "Three cases are described of severe congestive heart failure which failed to respond to digitalis, high doses of loop diuretics, and converting-enzyme inhibitors. The addition of spironolactone produced a substantial diuresis associated with clinical and radiological improvement in each case. Although a reversible deterioration in renal function was observed, this drug combination represents a therapeutic option in end-stage heart failure.", 
    "283": "The enkephalin-hydrolyzing peptidases in mouse vas deferens were studied and compared with those in guinea pig ileum which had been characterized in the previous study. The present results showed that three distinct peptidases, bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, captopril-sensitive peptidyl dipeptidase A, and thiorphan-sensitive endopeptidase-24.11, played a critical role in the inactivation of enkephalin in mouse vas deferens, being consistent with the previous results obtained with guinea pig ileum. However, the data in both previous and present studies showed that the activity of the bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase relative to that of either the captopril-sensitive peptidyl dipeptidase A or the thiorphan-sensitive endopeptidase-24.11 in guinea pig ileum was higher than that in mouse vas deferens, while the activity of either peptidyl dipeptidase A or endopeptidase-24.11 relative to that of aminopeptidase in mouse vas deferens was higher than that in guinea-pig ileum. In contrast to these three enzymes, both L-tyrosyl-L-tyrosine-sensitive dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and D-phenylalanine-sensitive carboxypeptidase were suggested not to be involved significantly in the inactivation of enkephalin in mouse vas deferens as well as guinea pig ileum.", 
    "284": "The susceptibility to cerebral ischemia was studied in stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSR) treated by a long-term antihypertensive treatment, and compared with untreated SHRSR and Wistar rats (WR). Male SHRSR, aged 8 weeks, were divided into two groups and a long-term antihypertensive treatment for 4-6 weeks was started on one group (treated SHRSR: T-SHR) while the other group was left untreated as control (untreated SHRSR: U-SHR). The changes of blood pressure were checked on these rats. The prior treatment of hypertension was achieved by administration of hydroflumethiazide (120 mg/kg/day) and captopril (15-30 mg/kg/day) orally for 4-6 weeks by mixing in drinking water. All the experiments were performed at the age of 12-16 weeks and WR of similar age served as normotensive untreated control. Cerebral ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BLCL) and blood pressure was always checked before BLCL. The survival ratio was observed from 1 hour to 24 hours after BLCL. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured before and 4 hours after BLCL periodically. The brain energy metabolites were measured 4 hours after BLCL. rCBF were measured at the thalamus by the hydrogen clearance method. ATP concentrations were determined by luciferine-luciferase method, c-AMP was measured by RIA and lactate by enzymatic method. The brain water content was measured by freeze-dry method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "285": "The norepinephrine - (50, 100 and 200 ng/kg per min) induced rise in blood pressure (BP) was determined in six health male volunteers following angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by either captopril (100 mg orally) or HOE 498 (10 mg orally). In terms of absolute BP measurements both compounds induced a reduction in basal and norepinephrine stimulated BP, whereas norepinephrine induced increments of BP above individual basal levels were unchanged by either converting enzyme inhibitor. It is concluded that attenuation of the pressor response to norepinephrine does not contribute to the hypotensive action of ACE inhibitors in healthy man.", 
    "286": "Eight healthy volunteers received both oral enalapril (EN; MK-421) 20 mg and placebo (PL) under stable conditions of sodium repletion, 300 mmol sodium/day (HS) and sodium depletion, 10 mmol sodium/day (LS). During PL therapy, fivefold increases in the plasma concentrations of renin and aldosterone were observed when measurements under LS were compared with those under HS conditions. Basal blood pressure (BP) readings were consistently higher and the hypotensive response to EN greater under LS compared with HS conditions. After EN, renal plasma flow increased significantly over the first 4 h, while the glomerular filtration rate, measured both by inulin and creatinine clearances, did not change. A significant natriuretic response was observed within 2 h; further natriuresis between 6 and 12 h after EN was accompanied by increased phosphate excretion.", 
    "287": "The acute and chronic cardiovascular effects of S9490-3, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, were studied by means of a computerized analysis of the intra-aortic blood pressure recorded for 48 consecutive hours, in the conscious, unrestrained adult spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). The software used allowed the simultaneous study of one control and one treated animal. A single intravenous dose of S9490-3 (2 mg/kg) induced a rapid fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which remained significant for 11 h. This decrease was not associated with an elevation in heart rate. A chronic oral treatment with S9490-3 (1 mg/kg/24 h for 12 days) significantly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure and reduced the variability of systolic blood pressure. The heart rate was slightly increased at rest (day time) but significantly elevated in the freely exercising SHR (night time). However, it must be noted that this increase remained moderate. The baroreflex sensitivity of chronically treated animals was enhanced when measured after phenylephrine but not after nitroglycerine bolus. Chronically given S9490-3 significantly reduced the pressor effect of phenylephrine and decreased the left ventricle weight.", 
    "288": "The significance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) for circulatory homeostasis during gravitational stress (10 min of lower body negative pressure, LBNP, at -40 mmHg) was investigated in eight men on liberal sodium intake. The function of RAS was inhibited by a single oral dose of 100 mg captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Plasma concentrations of renin and angiotensin I were normal before and increased after captopril and during LBNP. Plasma concentration of angiotensin II was normal before captopril, increased during LBNP, and fell to low values after captopril. Systolic blood pressure decreased more during LBNP after captopril than in the control situation. In three cases, the LBNP experiment after captopril had to be interrupted due to marked hypotension. Heart rate and plasma concentration of adrenaline increased above pre-captopril levels. In six subjects, plasma concentration of noradrenaline increased more during LBNP after captopril, less in two subjects, whereas the arginine vasopressin concentration increased more after captopril in all five subjects where measurements were available. The results demonstrate that RAS participates in blood pressure homeostasis also in sodium-replete, normal man. The enhanced increases in heart rate and plasma catecholamines after captopril do not suggest that sympathetic reflex activity during gravitational stress is blunted after captopril, in contrast to the evidence from animal experiments.", 
    "289": "We demonstrate that [3H]captopril selectively labels angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.14.15.1) (ACE) and employ this technique to probe enzyme-inhibitor interactions. [3H]Captopril binding sites copurify with ACE activity from rat lung or rat brain. At each stage of the purification the Vmax/Bmax ratio, or kcat is 17,000 min-1 with hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine as substrate. The specificity of [3H]captopril binding is apparent in the similar pharmacologic profile of inhibition in crude and pure enzyme preparations. Furthermore, binding sites and enzyme activity comigrate in gel filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments. Equilibrium analysis of [3H]captopril binding to purified ACE reveals a Bmax of 6 nmol/mg of protein (KD = 2 nM), demonstrating the presence of one inhibitor binding site per polypeptide chain. The kinetics of [3H]captopril binding are characterized by monophasic association and dissociation rate constants of 0.026 nM-1 min-1 and 0.034 min-1, respectively. The affinity of ACE for both [3H] captopril and enalaprilat is greater at 37 degrees than at 0 degree, demonstrating that these interactions are entropically driven, perhaps by an isomerization of the enzyme molecule. The ionic requirements for [3H]captopril binding and substrate catalysis differ. Chloride and bromide ion, but not fluoride, are about 100-fold more potent stimulators of binding than catalysis. When the active site Zn2+ ion is replaced by Co2+, catalysis was stimulated 2-fold, whereas binding activity was decreased by 70%.", 
    "290": "A series of inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, EC 3.4.15.1) is described which addresses certain conformational aspects of the enzyme-inhibitor interaction. In this study the alanylproline portion of the potent ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (2) is replaced by a series of monocyclic lactams containing the required recognition and binding elements. In order to more fully assess the lactam ring conformations and the key backbone angle psi as defined in 3 with respect to possible enzyme-bound conformations, a series of model lactams was investigated with use of molecular mechanics. The results point to a correlation between inhibitor potency (IC50) and the computed psi angle for the lowest energy conformation of the model compounds. Thus the psi angle as defined in 3 is an important determinant in the binding of inhibitors to ACE. The inhibition data in conjunction with the computational data have served to define a window of psi angles from 130 degrees to 170 degrees which seems to be acceptable to the ACE active site.", 
    "291": "We have investigated the role of angiotensin II in the development of high blood pressure and in the maintenance of renal function during 2 weeks of one-kidney renal artery stenosis in conscious dogs. Responses to a fixed degree of inflation of a balloon cuff around the renal artery were compared in dogs with or without continuous enalapril (MK 421) treatment. In six untreated dogs, mean aortic pressure was increased by 17.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, due primarily to increases in total peripheral resistance with little change in cardiac output, while glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, renal artery pressure, and plasma renin activity were back to prestenosis levels. In seven enalapril-treated dogs mean aortic pressure was increased by 23.0 +/- 2.7 mm Hg and was not significantly different from that occurring in untreated dogs. This rise was due to increases in total peripheral resistance (10%) and cardiac output (12%). In the absence of angiotensin II, glomerular filtration rate remained low, at only 56 +/- 6% of prestenosis levels. Renal blood flow returned to normal, but the renal artery pressure remained 25% lower than control values. Thus, the main role of angiotensin II in chronic one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension does not appear to be through its pressor properties but rather through its actions in the kidney to preserve glomerular filtration. This effect on renal function persisted throughout the course of the hypertension, even when the plasma renin levels returned to normal.", 
    "292": "Although past reports have identified a variety of prognostic factors in patients with severe chronic heart failure, previous studies have not evaluated the interaction of prognostic variables and drug treatment. We analyzed the association of 30 clinical, hemodynamic, and biochemical variables with survival in 203 consecutive patients with severe heart failure; all variables were assessed just before initiation of treatment with a variety of vasodilator drugs, and all patients were subsequently followed for 6 to 94 months. By regression analysis, pretreatment serum sodium concentration was the most powerful predictor of cardiovascular mortality, with hyponatremic patients having a substantially shorter median survival than did patients with a normal serum sodium concentration (164 vs 373 days, p = .006). The unfavorable prognosis for hyponatremic patients appeared to be related to the marked elevation of plasma renin activity that we noted in these individuals (10.0 +/- 2.0 ng/ml/hr), since hyponatremic patients fared significantly better when treated with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors than when treated with vasodilator drugs that did not interfere with angiotensin II biosynthesis (median survival 232 vs 108 days, p = .003). In contrast, there was no selective benefit of converting-enzyme inhibition on the survival of patients with a normal serum sodium concentration, in whom plasma renin activity was low (1.9 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/hr). This interaction between serum sodium concentration, drug treatment, and long-term outcome suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may exert a deleterious effect on the survival of some patients with chronic heart failure, which can be antagonized by converting enzyme inhibition, and provides a clinical counterpart for the similar prognostic role that has been postulated for angiotensin II in experimental preparations of heart failure.", 
    "293": "The relationship between hypertension and cardiovascular damage was assessed in three groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR): 1. stroke prone SHR (SHR-SP) treated orally with an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) (100-400 mg/L in the drinking water) from 6 to 35 weeks of age, 2. SHR-SP maintained on tap water until 30 weeks of age, 3. stroke resistant SHR (SHR-SR) maintained on tap water. The controls were Wister Kyoto rats (WKY) maintained on tap water. Captopril-treated SHR-SP showed blood pressure lower than that of untreated SHR-SP, similar to SHR-SR. The ratio of heart weight to body weight was 0.55% in SHR-SP, 0.39% in captopril-treated SHR-SP, 0.46% in SHR-SR, and 0.39% in WKY. The kidneys of SHR-SP showed glomerular sclerosis, glomerular fibrosis, tubular casts, interstitial cell infiltration and vascular wall thickening or hyperplasia of the small arteries and arterioles. The severe glomerular sclerosis was mostly distributed in the inner and middle portions of cortex. Immunohistological study showed IgG, C3 and fibrinogen in the glomeruli and arterioles in SHR-SP. In captopril-treated SHR-SP, similar to SHR-SR, only minor histological changes were seen and there was no deposition of IgG, C3 or fibrinogen. No changes were seen in WKY. Thus, it was concluded that nephrosclerosis and cardiac hypertrophy in SHR-SP are prevented by captopril. The role of the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems in organ pathogenesis in SHR-SP is discussed.", 
    "294": "The haemodynamic pattern of the common carotid artery was studied in men with sustained essential hypertension using pulsed Doppler methods before and after administration of vasodilating drugs. Captopril produced both a fall in vascular resistance and an increase in arterial diameter of the common carotid artery. Isosorbide dinitrate increased markedly the arterial diameter but did not change vascular resistance. Nitrendipine decreased vascular resistance with no change in the arterial diameter. In the common carotid circulation of patients with essential hypertension, vasodilating drugs may either dilate small arteries (nitrendipine), large arteries (isosorbide dinitrate), or both (captopril).", 
    "295": "To evaluate the influence of renal function on the efficacy of converting-enzyme inhibition in patients with severe chronic heart failure, we measured the long-term hemodynamic and clinical responses to captopril in 101 consecutive patients with heart failure grouped according to pretreatment serum creatinine concentration (group I, less than 1.4 mg/dL; group II, 1.4 to 2.8 mg/dL; and group III, greater than 2.8 mg/dL). After 1 to 3 months of treatment, patients with preserved renal function (group I) had greater increases in stroke volume index and greater decreases in left ventricular filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance than did patients with renal impairment (groups II and III) (p less than 0.05). Clinical improvement paralleled these hemodynamic benefits; only 2 of 12 patients with severe renal insufficiency (group III) improved clinically compared with 29 of 40 patients with preserved renal function (group I) and 29 of 49 patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (group II), (p less than 0.005). Therapy-limiting rash and dysgeusia occurred most frequently in patients with renal impairment. Our findings support an important role for the kidneys in mediating the beneficial actions of captopril in patients with severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "296": "Several antihypertensive drugs have an adverse effect on glucose tolerance that may partially or completely negate the beneficial effects of reducing blood pressure as it relates to the incidence of coronary heart disease and its complications. Diuretics (particularly high doses) and beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have the greatest adverse effect on glucose intolerance. Central alpha-agonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-blockers do not adversely affect glucose and are preferred in diabetic hypertensive patients, selected hypertensive patients at risk for developing glucose intolerance, and probably most other patients with mild essential hypertension as initial and/or monotherapy compared with diuretics and beta-blockers.", 
    "297": "The chronic heart insufficiency is essentially characterized by a disturbed regulative function of the peripheral circulation. These processes taking place within efforts for compensation close the chain of the vicious circle. The vasodilators with their different principles of effect affect in various places of the vegetative nervous system up to the smooth musculature of the vessels and modulate the peripheral part of the cardiovascular system. Via a changed behaviour of the impedance also with the arterial vasodilation the ejection behaviour of the insufficed hearts changes. With the increase of the ejection fraction the filling pressure can decrease, also when only the arterial branch of the periphery of the vessels is influenced. In case of an additional vasodilation of the capacity vessels greater influences of the preload are present. As a rule after the full use of the conventional therapy with digitalis and saluretics is resorted to the adjuvant therapy with vasodilators. Good experiences in the therapy of chronic heart insufficiency are present above all for hydralazine and prazosin as well as increasingly also for captopril, when vasodilating and at the same time positively inotropic medicaments are disregarded. In future, depending upon haemodynamic and neurohumoral (PNA, PRAA) findings in problematic cases and aimed additional adjuvant therapy will be aspired to.", 
    "298": "Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare but difficult-to-manage condition. Adequate clinical trials of agents used in its treatment have not been performed. A variety of drugs have been reported to provide benefit in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, including beta-adrenoceptor agonists, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, and vasodilators such as isosorbide dinitrate, diazoxide, hydralazine, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, prostaglandins and calcium antagonists. Calcium antagonists appear to offer the most promise, although treatment failures have occurred with them as well as with all other drugs used in this condition. In the absence of a specific treatment for primary pulmonary hypertension, several of the agents listed above should be tried before accepting therapeutic failure. Invasive investigation is necessary to adequately monitor the acute response to therapy. Whether combination therapy with 2 or more drugs might improve the response to treatment is an area worthy of further research.", 
    "299": "The mechanisms underlying potentiation by captopril of the depressor responses to arachidonic acid were studied in chloralose-anaesthetized rats. Captopril, in a dose (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) which inhibited the pressor responses to angiotensin I (0.03-1 microgram/kg, i.v.), enhanced the depressor responses to bradykinin (3-300 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and potentiated the hypotensive action of arachidonic acid (3 mg/kg, intravenously). This phenomenon was observed not only when captopril and arachidonic acid were administered intravenously, but also when these compounds were injected directly into the aortic arch. The enhancement of arachidonic acid-induced hypotension by captopril was not significantly affected by pretreatment with a low dose of aprotinin (3 mg/kg, i.v.), but was abolished by bilateral nephrectomy or by pretreatment with a higher dose of aprotinin (6 mg/kg, i.v.). It is suggested that captopril augments the depressor responses to arachidonic acid by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme. This results in accumulation of bradykinin which in turn increases release of vasodilator prostaglandins, originating most probably, from the kidneys. The possibility that blockade of angiotensin II formation by captopril may leave the vasodilator action of prostaglandin unopposed cannot be excluded.", 
    "300": "Cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells contain a second peptidyl dipeptidase, distinct from angiotensin-converting enzyme, present in an inactive form associated with a non-dialyzable inhibitor. Partial purification by glycine affinity chromatography separates enzyme from inhibitor to yield a preparation which hydrolyzes angiotensin-1, bradykinin, substance P, atriopeptin-2, enkephalin and Hip-His-Leu. This enzyme is resistant to inhibition by lisinopril, captopril, thiorphan, phosphoramidon, soybean trypsin inhibitor, PMSF and aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase inhibitors, but is inhibited by EDTA.", 
    "301": "In a 46-year-old female patient suffering from renal hypertension due to polycystic kidney degeneration with creatinine values between 3 and 5 mg/dl leucopenia developed 3 weeks after beginning antihypertensive therapy with the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril. On continuation of treatment signs of haemorrhagic diathesis appeared 7 months later. Cytology and histology led to the diagnosis of panmyelopathy which, from the clinical findings and the close patient follow-up, was to be regarded as captopril-induced. Bone-marrow regeneration could be shown 6 months after discontinuing the drug. In renal insufficiency, captopril treatment should be monitored using regular haematological tests and the drug withdrawn when leuco- or thrombocytopenia occurs.", 
    "302": "This panel considered the clinical implications of nephrotoxicity due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Although the clinical benefits and safety of these agents are well established, the drugs may adversely affect renal perfusion, electrolyte balance, and blood pressure in susceptible patients. The renal effects of these agents are directly related to their potency in inhibiting renal prostaglandins as reflected by inhibition of urinary prostaglandin excretion; however, none of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is completely free of the risk. Hyperkalemia is the most frequently observed adverse effect, most commonly occurring in patients with diabetes mellitus, patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency, and patients receiving beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or potassium-sparing agents. Patients at risk for the development of fluid retention and acute reductions in glomerular filtration rate include those with congestive heart failure, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic glomerulonephritis, or liver failure with ascites, those receiving diuretics, premature infants, and possibly the elderly. Monitoring of serum creatinine and electrolyte levels, blood pressure, and body weight is suggested for susceptible patients receiving these agents.", 
    "303": "Generalized arteriolar vasoconstriction is the dominant element in essential hypertension. Although the proximate cause of this process remains elusive, several lines of evidence suggest that abnormalities in prostaglandin and thromboxane metabolism may contribute to the pathophysiology of hypertension. Diminished endogenous synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins and enhanced formation of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane may participate in this process, particularly in the kidney. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, may aggravate blood pressure control, especially when used with certain diuretics and other antihypertensive medications. Attempts to enhance endogenous synthesis of prostaglandin metabolites expressing potent vasodilator properties by supplementation of the diet with polyunsaturated fatty acids may provide a new strategy to control blood pressure.", 
    "304": "Conscious, adult, water-deprived Brattleboro rats treated neonatally with capsaicin or vehicle showed similar hypotensive responses to sequential inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (with captopril) and antagonism of ganglionic transmission (with pentolinium). Following a comparable experimental protocol, Long-Evans rats treated neonatally with capsaicin showed a more marked hypotensive response to captopril administration than did vehicle-injected animals. Furthermore, following administration of captopril and pentolinium, the capsaicin-treated animals showed marked impairment of the vasopressin-dependent recovery of blood pressure. These results indicate that the greater hypotensive response to captopril in water-deprived. Long-Evans rats treated neonatally with capsaicin may be due to less effective compensation for inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system when vasopressin release is impaired.", 
    "305": "A case of Takayasu's arteritis complicated by renovascular hypertension is described. The hypertension was refractory to conventional medical treatment but responsive to captopril therapy. Deterioration in renal function occurred on initiation of captopril therapy; this resolved on reduction of dosage. A captopril-induced disturbance of renal autoregulation was probably responsible for this phenomenon.", 
    "306": "A total of 18 patients with chronic congestive heart failure were examined using an acute pharmacological test (25-50 mg of captopril) and during 2-week course treatment. A marked positive effect of the drug was noted in 15 (83.3%) patients. Captopril significantly decreased venous tone by 19.0 +/- 2.4% and by 40.4 +/- 4.1% and regional vascular resistance by 25.7 +/- 1.9% and by 39.4 +/- 2.9% in the acute test and in course treatment, respectively. Microcirculatory indices also improved: there was an increase in tissue oxygenation (PO2 by 38.8 +/- 2.7%), oxygen supply rate and small arteriolar function (more pronounced in course treatment). Platelet aggregation in the captopril acute test was slightly decreased but in course treatment it did not significantly differ from the initial one. A conclusion was made that captopril, mostly in course treatment, decreased venular and arteriolar tone and improved microcirculatory processes making an insignificant effect on platelet aggregation permitting its recommendation for prolonged treatment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with minimum risk of complications.", 
    "307": "A study was made of the efficacy of captopril used alone and in combination with cardiac glycosides in 20 patients with stage IIB congestive heart failure. The patients' clinical status and changes in some indices of hemodynamics and external respiratory function were taken into account. A single use of the drug improved the clinical status and indices of hemodynamics and external respiratory function in the patients. The most noticeable clinical effect was achieved with the combined use of cardiac glycosides, diuretics and captopril.", 
    "308": "The efficacy of captopril alone or in combination with indapamide was evaluated in 17 patients with severe hypertension (diastolic greater than 120 mmHg) previously treated with triple antihypertensive therapy, i.e. diuretic, beta-blocker and a vasodilator. After a wash-out period of 1 week, captopril was given initially as 75 mg/day for 2 weeks; at the end of this period, the dosage was doubled to 150 mg/day and continued at this level for a further 2 weeks. Indapamide (2.5 mg/day) was then added to the regimen and administered for 1 month. The results showed that captopril alone lowered, but did not normalize the blood pressure. The mean diastolic pressure was reduced to 117 and 103.8 mmHg after dosages of captopril of 75 mg and 150 mg, respectively. On the addition of indapamide, the blood pressure was normalized to 93.82 mmHg mean diastolic pressure. Systolic readings were similarly reduced. Two patients developed skin rashes while on captopril alone: no other treatment-related side-effects were reported once indapamide therapy had commenced.", 
    "309": "Bradykinin is one of the most potent vasodilators and in the kidney it develops a marked diuretic and natriuretic action. The natriuretic effect of the peptide is mediated by prostaglandins. The mechanism of bradykinin induced vasodilation, however, is not yet known. Therefore, in this study the blood pressure lowering effect of bradykinin was investigated in five normotensive volunteers. Bradykinin was injected intravenously in doses between 0.001 and 7.5 micrograms/kg of body weight. Intraarterially measured blood pressure decreased in a dose related manner from 0.25 to 1.0 micrograms/kg. Changes in oral salt intake (10 to 300 nmol Na+/d) had no effect on the action of bradykinin as well as pretreatment with either indomethacin (2 X 50 mg) or propranolol (80 mg). Captopril (25 mg) potentiated the blood pressure lowering effect of bradykinin about 20-fold. In four patients with renal hypertension bradykinin provoked a more marked reduction in arterial blood pressure, while potentiation by captopril was not different in the hypertensives if compared to the normotensives. The results of our studies show that bradykinin lowers blood pressure by a direct mechanism, which acts independently of salt intake, beta-receptors and prostaglandins. Inhibition of inactivation of bradykinin by captopril enhances its activity markedly. In renal hypertension the arterial vessels are more sensitive to bradykinin than in normotension, probably indicating a lack of endogenous kinins in these patients.", 
    "310": "The effects of furosemide and Captopril were studied in normals and nephrectomized rats. Different doses of furosemide (5 to 50 mg/kg) increased the saliva kallikrein activity of submaxillary gland perfused with pilocarpine. Rats injected with captopril (10 mg) increased the blood flow of the gland, but did not modify the blood pressure. After furosemide (50 mg/kg) and captopril (10 mg), a decrease in arterial blood pressure was observed. The results suggest a release of glandular kallikrein which is secreted from the gland directly into the vascular compartment. On the other hand, rats sialodectomized showed no alterations in blood pressure in response to both drugs. These data suggest that submaxillary gland kallikrein play a role in regulating blood flow of the gland and blood pressure, at least in our experimental conditions.", 
    "311": "Autoregulatory efficiency of renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was evaluated in male Sprague-Dawley rats during interference with the renin-angiotensin system by a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), captopril (3 mg X h-1 X kg-1 BW). RBF and GFR were approximately 25 (p less than 0.01) and 20% (p less than 0.02) higher, respectively, in rats infused with CEI than in control rats at spontaneous renal arterial pressure (RAP). A reduction of RAP to 100 mm Hg (within the autoregulatory range) resulted in effective autoregulation of GFR and RBF in control rats. In rats given CEI, however, the autoregulation of GFR was markedly impaired. GFR decreased by 35% (p less than 0.001), while RBF remained relatively unchanged. This caused the filtration fraction to decrease from 0.33 +/- 0.01 to 0.29 +/- 0.01 (p less than 0.001). RAP had a consistent effect on the urine flow rate, even though both GFR and RBF were well autoregulated in control rats. No significant decrease in electrolyte excretion was detected within the autoregulatory range in control rats, but during converting enzyme blockade this excretion decreased progressively as RAP was reduced, and the decrease correlated well to the reduction in GFR. In summary, these results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important intrarenal role in the autoregulation of GFR, probably through an efferent arteriolar mechanism. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the contralateral kidney efficiently compensates in urinary electrolyte excretion for an acute unilateral reduction of RAP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "312": "Urgent hypertension is defined by severe elevations of blood pressure without associated end-organ damage. The use of parenteral agents for this entity entails intensive monitoring and the potential for significant hemodynamic complications. Therefore, various oral regimens have been studied. Herein described are mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and side effects of oral agents used in the treatment of urgent hypertension.", 
    "313": "We report a case of a bullous lichenoid eruption due to the intake of captopril. Clinical, histological, direct immunofluorescence and ultrastructural features were consistent with the diagnosis of lichen planus pemphigoides. In addition, the in vivo immunological study also revealed an intercellular fluorescence, similar to that seen in pemphigus. Complex drug-induced cutaneous reactions have been previously reported with other drugs, especially with D-penicillamine, which bears chemical similarities with captopril. However, such a drug-induced mixed pattern of lichen planus pemphigoides with pemphigus-like features has never been reported.", 
    "314": "Post-proline endopeptidase (PPE, EC 3.4.21.26) was purified 3,450 times from human lung. PPE was routinely assayed with the artificial substrate, carbobenzoxy-glycyl-L-prolyl-p-nitroanilide (Z-Gly-Pro-pNA). The pH optimum was 7.4, and the Mr was 77,000. Thiol blocking agents were strongly inhibitory but serine blocking agents were not inhibitory. No metal ions were required for activity, but heavy metal ions such as Hg2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ completely inactivated the enzyme. Both dithiothreitol (DTT) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were required to stabilize PPE activity. Michaelis constant values for Z-Gly-Pro-pNA and carbobenzoxy-glycyl-L-prolyl-2-naphthylamide were 0.36 and 0.10 mmol/l, respectively. PPE cleaved vasoactive peptides including bradykinin (BK) and des-(Arg9)-BK (Pro3-Gly4 and Pro7-Phe8 bonds), angiotensins I and II (Pro7-Phe8 bond), substance P (Pro4-Gln5 bond), and oxytocin (Pro7-Leu8 bond). Each of these peptides inhibited PPE-catalyzed hydrolysis of Z-Gly-Pro-pNA competitively. BK had the lowest Ki value (2.35 mumol/l) and oxytocin had the highest Ki value (84.0 mumol/l). PPE was not inhibited by captopril, a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, which also cleaves the Pro7-Phe8 bond of BK.", 
    "315": "We have previously reported on a high prevalence of high renin essential hypertension in psoriasis. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was also reported to be increased in some psoriatics, we found it rational to treat 10 patients with hypertension and diffuse psoriasis with captopril at a dose of 25 mg t.i.d. Five patients had high PRA levels and in 1 of them serum ACE was also increased. Serum creatinine, BUN and urinalysis were normal in all of them. SPB fell from 163 +/- 3 to 138 +/- 3 and DBP from 107 +/- 3 to 86 +/- 2 mm Hg after 1 month of captopril treatment. A surprising clinical improvement of the cutaneous lesions occurred in 3 patients previously resistant to every local or systemic treatment. Unfortunately, however, 3 patients developed heavy proteinuria (greater than 2 g/day) which disappeared after captopril discontinuation. The unexpected incidence of reversible proteinuria induced by low doses of captopril in our patients recommends a careful monitoring of the renal function every time this drug is employed in the treatment of hypertension in a psoriatic.", 
    "316": "Two groups of SHR were treated with captopril (Squibb): the first group (1 month old)--30 mg/kg i.p. twice daily for 77 days, and the second group (8 months old)--20 mg/kg p.o. twice a day for 23 days. The recording of electrocardiogram (ECG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and some isometric indices of the left-ventricular contractility indicate that in all treated animals the values of most of the parameters are considerably lowered compared to the controls. The ratio between velocity of pressure increase and intraventricular pressure/equal to 50 mmHg--(dP/dt)/ICP50/does not change significantly. It can be concluded that in SHR, captopril practically does not influence the inotropic condition of the myocardium.", 
    "317": "Variations in blood pressure were investigated by an automatic, non-invasive ambulatory method in 9 subjects with essential hypertension. Recordings were made after 6 week periods during which captopril was taken either once or twice daily, in a double-blind cross-over study. Although the effects of captopril administration either once or twice daily were broadly similar, there was a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure values on the once-daily regimen. These results suggests that treatment once a day can advantageously replace twice-daily treatment.", 
    "318": "The effect of exogenous angiotensin II on plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma renin concentration (PRC) and plasma aldosterone (PA) was investigated in a group of 8 patients with essential hypertension after one year of captopril therapy. The results were compared with those obtained in a group of 18 normotensive volunteers not on captopril. Angiotensin II was infused at increasing doses until a pressor response (increase of diastolic blood pressure by 20 mm Hg) was evoked. The normotensive volunteers exhibited the expected decline of PRA during angiotensin II infusion. However, no significant change was observed in PRA nor in PRC levels in the group of hypertensive patients. The PA values increased significantly both in volunteers and patients (P less than 0.02). The dose of angiotensin II necessary to evoke a pressor response was higher in the hypertensive patients than in the normotensive volunteers (6.0 +/- 2.6 s.d. ng/kg/min vs 2.5 +/- 0.9; P less than 0.01). We conclude that patients with essential hypertension, after chronic treatment with captopril, show no inhibition of renin secretion in contrast with the controls. They also require more angiotensin II to evoke a pressor response during infusion of this peptide.", 
    "319": "Twenty-seven mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients were treated with captopril alone or combined with hydrochlorothiazide and left ventricular echocardiographic changes were evaluated after 1, 3 and 6 months. The left ventricular mass decreased slightly after 3 months, together with mean wall stress and total peripheral resistance, while the cardiac performance, as measured by fractional shortening and cardiac output, was unaffected. A high degree of individual variability was observed, and only 9 out of 20 patients examined after 3 months had a consistent reduction in left ventricular mass. The effect of captopril on the isomyosin composition was also evaluated in 4 normotensive rats after 12 weeks of drug administration. No interference with the physiological pattern was observed and no modifications of the biochemical and structural properties of the myocardium were detected.", 
    "320": "This investigation was performed in two groups of adult patients, 10 with type I and 10 with type II diabetes mellitus, all with arterial hypertension (160 to 200 mm Hg systolic and 95 to 120 mm Hg diastolic). Captopril, 50 mg twice a day, was administered for 12 weeks and was effective as monotherapy in 16 patients. Mean arterial pressure (+/- s.d.) in type I patients changed from 121.4 +/- 9.6 to 100.2 +/- 10.1 after 4 weeks and to 102.0 +/- 3.8 mm Hg after 12 weeks; in type II patients it changed from 132.8 +/- 5.7 to 123.9 +/- 13.5 after 4 weeks and to 109.1 +/- 11.1 mm Hg after 12 weeks. The differences were statistically significant. In only 4 patients was it necessary to add a thiazide after the first month of therapy. No significant change was induced by captopril in urine output, osmolar clearance, free water clearance inulin, and PAH clearances. No significant change was observed in serum and urine Na+, Cl-, Ca++ and Mg++, whereas a statistically significant reduction was found in the renal clearances of K+ and PO4-. No important change in serum aldosterone was found, while plasma renin activity was increased, as expected. No alterations in urine protein, glucosaminoglycans, gamma GT, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase were observed during follow-up. All patients maintained good metabolic control of their disease. No neutropenia and orthostatic hypotension were seen. Captopril appears to be an effective and safe drug for lowering blood pressure in diabetic patients, without affecting renal function, electrolyte balance and the metabolic control of diabetes.", 
    "321": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of captopril on carbohydrate metabolism in diabetic patients with essential arterial hypertension. Sixteen patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension were studied. Captopril was employed in different doses, and where patients receiving 100 mg/day remained hypertensive, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/day was added. Treatment was maintained for 90 days in 14 patients, 2 being excluded because of side effects. Basal blood pressure was normalized in 8 patients (57%) with captopril alone, and in 6 patients (43%) following the addition of hydrochlorothiazide. Basal glucose levels were not altered. Oral glucose tolerance tests performed during captopril treatment showed a lower glucose response, without changes in the insulin response. There was significant weight loss during the study. We conclude that captopril appears to be a safe treatment in essential hypertension associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, producing no deleterious effects on metabolic control.", 
    "322": "The acute effects of captopril in three groups of patients with coronary artery disease were studied: 25 patients with congestive heart failure; 8 patients with hypertension; and 14 normotensive patients with angina, and systolic arterial pressure greater than 120 mmHg, but no evidence of heart failure. Systemic haemodynamics were assessed by balloon-tipped thermodilution catheter and coronary haemodynamics were assessed by thermodilution catheter in the coronary sinus. Despite significantly different baseline haemodynamic values, captopril decrease systolic arterial pressure without increasing heart rate in all three groups, thereby decreasing double-product, a major determinant of myocardial work. Coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption decreased similarly in all groups and decreased in parallel to double-product, while coronary vascular resistance and transmyocardial oxygen difference did not change except for a slight decrease in transmyocardial oxygen difference in those patients with congestive heart failure. Transmyocardial lactate extraction increased insignificantly. These findings suggest that captopril may improve metabolic balance in various types of patients with coronary artery disease and that it does this by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "323": "Nine patients with coronary insufficiency were investigated using an exercise test coupled with quantitative myocardial tomoscintigraphy with thallium-201 before and after 48 hours' treatment with captopril. After captopril treatment, an improvement in ST segment depression was noted during exercise. The quantitative tomoscintigraphy showed a reduction in the ischaemic zone with captopril during exercise. However, in three patients, although there was an overall improvement in myocardial perfusion during exercise, aggravation of wash-out was observed in some regions, reminiscent of a coronary steal effect.", 
    "324": "The effect of captopril was studied in 40 hypertensive patients (WHO stages I and II) with peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs (Fontaine stages IIa and IIb). We assessed systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate in supine and upright position, relative and absolute pain free intervals, and ankle/arm pressure index at rest and after treadmill exercise test. In the first part of the study 20 patients were divided into two groups, one of which was treated with chlorthalidone (25 mg/day) and the other with captopril (50 mg two times a day) for 8 weeks. Statistically significant improvements were only obtained in the captopril-treated group. They concerned the ankle/arm pressure index at rest (P less than 0.05) and after exercise (P less than 0.05) and the absolute pain free interval (P less than 0.05) as well as systolic arterial pressure. Furthermore, 20 more patients were treated with captopril (50 mg two times a day) for 8 weeks, and improvements were found in ankle/arm pressure index at rest (P less than 0.01) and after exercise (P less than 0.001) and in relative and absolute pain free intervals (P less than 0.001) as well as in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure. These results indicate an increase in flow to the limbs of patients with vascular disease treated with captopril, and suggest that captopril is an effective drug without contraindications for the treatment of hypertension associated with claudication.", 
    "325": "In 15 patients with moderate congestive heart failure not completely controlled on digoxin (0.25 mg o.d.) and frusemide (25 mg o.d.), we compared the addition of captopril (12.5 to 50 mg b.i.d.) with increasing doses of frusemide (25 to 100 mg o.d.), in a randomized double-blind, double-dummy, comparative trial. Thirteen patients completed the 3 months study: two dropped-out in the frusemide group. Statistically significant clinical improvement occurred in both treatment groups. Exercise tolerance also significantly improved in both groups in a parallel fashion. Echocardiographic cardiac function data showed a significantly better pattern of changes in the captopril group. The addition of low doses of captopril to basal therapy seems to be as effective as the addition of high doses of frusemide in uncontrolled moderate congestive heart failure. This approach with captopril also appears to be more physiological and safe.", 
    "326": "Captopril 25 mg every 8 hours for 1 month appeared to improve dynamic effort tolerance and cardiac function under the stress of isometric exercise in patients with chronic heart failure, functional class II-III NYHA. The improvement was comparable to that obtained in the same subjects with digoxin 0.25 mg once a day given for a similar period of 1 month. Therefore, captopril with its lower toxicity and wider therapeutic range, might be considered as a valid alternative to digoxin for treatment of patients in sinus rhythm with mild to moderate heart failure.", 
    "327": "Eight patients with NYHA Class II congestive heart failure were studied before and after captopril with right heart catheterization, cycloergometric stress tests and radionuclide 99Tc cineventriculography. Acute administration of captopril increased stroke volume and cardiac index and reduced left ventricular filling pressure. Similar changes though less marked were seen after 30 days of captopril therapy. Functional aerobic capacity and left ventricular performance improved over 15 and 30 days of captopril respectively. We therefore suggest that captopril can be effective also in patients with moderate congestive heart failure.", 
    "328": "A study was made of ten subjects with post myocardial left ventricular failure. All patients were treated with captopril with successive doses of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg. Heart rate and mean blood pressure remained unchanged. Cardiac output increased from 4.30 +/- 0.56 to 4.6 +/- 0.57 litres/min in response to the 12.5 mg dose (P less than 0.05), from 4.30 +/- 0.56 to 4.77 +/- 0.59 litres/min on administration of the 25 mg dose (P less than 0.01) and from 4.34 +/- 0.56 to 4.86 +/- 0.66 litres/min after the 50 mg dose (P less than 0.01). Total systemic resistance fell from a baseline mean of 1847 +/- 338 to 1697 +/- 35 dyne/s/cm-5 with the 12.5 mg dose, to 1547 +/- 329 with the 25 mg dose and to 1489 +/- 308 with the 50 mg dose. All the reductions were statistically significant. Right atrial pressure, pulmonary blood pressure, wedge pressure, total pulmonary resistance and pre-capillary resistance decreased statistically significantly. In a separate study on the possibility that captopril long term therapy may induce tachyphylaxis we studied the acute haemodynamic effects of a dose of 25 mg of captopril after 17 to 36 months (mean 29.5 +/- 5.3) treatment with it for chronic congestive heart failure. Cardiac index increased from 2.02 +/- 0.25 to 2.59 +/- 0.62 (P less than 0.01) total systemic resistance, mean pulmonary pressure and wedge pressure decreased statistically significantly.", 
    "329": "The effects on intra- and extracellular Na+ and K+ (Nai, Ki; Nae, Ke) of 2 months treatment with captopril or hydrochlorothiazide given alone or in combination were assessed in 47 hypertensive patients. Before therapy, diastolic blood pressure was directly related to Nai and to Nai/Ki and inversely to Ki. The correlation coefficient was even higher when Ki/Ke was considered instead of Ki alone. Treatment with captopril induced a decrease in Nai, no change in Ke and an increase in Ki and Ki/Ke. Hydrochlorothiazide induced a decrease in Nai, in Ke and in Ki but an increase in Ki/Ke. The Nai decrease was maximal in patients receiving the combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. In these subjects Ke was not reduced and Ki was still increased. The percent reduction in diastolic blood pressure induced by captopril was significantly related to the percent increase in Ki/Ke whereas the reduction induced by hydrochlorothiazide was best related to the decrease in Nai/Nae. These data suggest that blood pressure is related to the Ki/Ke ratio and that any increase in this ratio could produce a fall in blood pressure. This phenomenon can be explained by the Ki/Ke ratio being an important factor in determining membrane potential and thus arterial smooth muscle tone.", 
    "330": "The effect of captopril on inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) one week after myocardial infarction was studied in 6 Yorkshire swine. In 24 pigs, controlled myocardial infarction (MI) was produced by reversible occlusion of the left anterior descending artery during 60 minutes using an inflatable balloon catheter. Four animals died during this procedure and another 4 during the first week. After 7 days, programmed electrical stimulation (PES) was performed in the surviving animals. Seven animals showed inducible VT, which could not be terminated in one. Subsequently, intravenous captopril (0.6-1.2 mg/kg) was administered as a rapid bolus injection. PES was repeated after 5 minutes and VT was no longer inducible in all 6 pigs (P less than 0.05). Right ventricular refractoriness decreased from 253 to 228 ms (n.s.). Blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly changed. We conclude that captopril can protect the heart against PES-induced VT late after MI. It is suggested that inhibition of angiotensin II and subsequent inhibition of noradrenaline may be responsible for this effect.", 
    "331": "Ninety-four patients on digitalis treatment for chronic congestive heart failure (NYHA class II-III) were enrolled for a 12 month trial in a random, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After a placebo run-in period, patients were assigned to placebo or captopril 25 mg t.i.d. Digitalis was continued while diuretics were withdrawn. Clinical status, exercise capacity, cardiac dimensions and performance were evaluated with a full physical examination, 12 lead ECG, chest X-ray, 24 hour Holter monitoring, bicycle effort capacity, M-mode echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography at 1, 2 and 3 weeks and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months. There were no significant differences in the trend of survival curves after six months follow-up between the captopril or placebo treatment groups. Patients treated with captopril, without the addition of diuretics, had an improvement in NYHA class (P less than 0.01), an increase in exercise capacity (P less than 0.025), a decrease in cardiothoracic ratio (P less than 0.025) and an increase of echocardiographic left ventricular contractility (P less than 0.005). Only four patients treated with captopril were withdrawn from the follow-up for allergic side effects. Preliminary results at 6 months prove that captopril, compared to placebo, is useful in mild to moderate heart failure.", 
    "332": "One hundred and ten mild and moderately hypertensive patients were treated with a fixed combination of captopril 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (Capozide 50) once daily for 12 months. Eighty four patients were treated initially with Capozide 50 12 hourly for 3 months before receiving Capozide 50 o.d.; the other 26 patients received Capozide 50 as initial treatment immediately after the placebo run-in period. Blood pressures were measured 24 hours after ingestion of the drug. Capozide 50 once daily induced statistically significant reductions in supine blood pressure and these beneficial effects were sustained throughout the duration of the trial. In patients receiving Capozide 50 as initial therapy, a gradual hypotensive effect was seen. No clinically significant changes in biochemical or haematological variables were recorded although a small but statistically significant rise in uric acid was noted. This latter effect was attributed to the thiazide component of the combination. The efficacy and safety profile of this once-a-day compound makes it an ideal therapeutic agent for the management of mild and moderate hypertension.", 
    "333": "In order to assess the neurohormonal responses to oral administration of two drugs with different antihypertensive mechanisms, and their implications for long-term efficacy, we studied the changes in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, catecholamines and blood pressure after two cross-over periods of treatment with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide for three months in 14 patients with moderate essential hypertension. Similar levels of plasma renin activity were achieved with both but plasma levels of noradrenaline and aldosterone rose with hydrochlorothiazide (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.05). Dopamine levels decreased with captopril. Six patients on hydrochlorothiazide had potassium levels under 3.5 mmol/l. Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide were effective in controlling blood pressure in 78% and 50% of the patients respectively, but in cases where noradrenaline was significantly increased after treatment, the effect on diastolic blood pressure was less (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that captopril is highly effective for blood pressure control and that the neurohormonal responses to the drug probably provide additional benefits for long-term therapy in hypertension.", 
    "334": "Fifty-six elderly patients (mean age 72.1 +/- 4.1 years; mean creatinine 111.0 +/- 9.8 mumol/l were randomly assigned to either captopril (C) hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) fixed combination once daily (o.d.) (n = 29) or placebo (n = 27). Previous medication was stopped and following a run-in period of 2 weeks on placebo, the initial dosage was C (25 mg)/HCT (12.5 mg) o.d.; after 6 weeks it was increased to C (50 mg)/HCT (25 mg) o.d. for all the treated subjects; these doses were maintained for an additional 6 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, body weight and side effects were assessed every 2 weeks. After the run-in period as well as after the two treatment periods, routine biochemical examinations were carried out on all patients. Twenty to 24 hours after the last intake both C 25/HCT 12.5 o.d. and C 50/HCT 25 o.d. had significantly lowered blood pressure compared with placebo (P less than 0.001). The percentages of normalized patients (supine diastolic less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) were 3.7% (placebo), 72.4% (C25/HCT 12.5) after 6 weeks and 7.7% (placebo) and 96.6% (C 50/HCT 25) after 12 weeks. No important side effect was reported on captopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination. Haematological and biochemical changes were within the normal range in both groups. We conclude that a once daily captopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination is effective and safe in elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "335": "A comparative study was made of the effects of a new therapeutic agent consisting of 50 mg captopril and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (Capozide) with an already existing agent Moduretic (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 5 mg amiloride). In the Capozide group (32 patients), 20 achieved normal blood pressure, 8 responded but were not brought under control, and 3 were non-responders. In the Moduretic group (31 patients), 17 achieved normal blood pressure, 10 were partially controlled and 4 were non-responders. Moduretic appeared to be most effective in patients previously untreated or who had been taking only one drug, while Capozide controlled patients who had been taking 1 or 2 antihypertensive drugs which had been either ineffective or poorly tolerated. The long-acting effect of a single dose of Capozide was demonstrated by blood pressure measurements taken at least 10 hours later. Both drugs were generally well tolerated and no significant changes were observed in the laboratory measurements. The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with a diuretic proved more effective than single agents in lowering raised blood pressure. We therefore conclude that Capozide is an effective alternative to traditional medication in the treatment of moderate hypertension.", 
    "336": "We measured red blood cell Na+-K+ pump, Na+-Li+ countertransport and Na+-K+ cotransport activities, together with intraerythrocyte sodium content before and after 3 months therapy with captopril and two other antihypertensive drugs (atenolol and canrenoate potassium) in subjects suffering from essential hypertension. All patients discontinued any previous treatment at least 3 months before the basal evaluation of cell membrane activities. All three drugs significantly lowered blood pressure but only captopril and canrenoate potassium induced significant modifications in red blood cell parameters. After three months of captopril therapy intraerythrocyte Na+ content was significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) without any detectable change in cation transport system activity. After 3 months of canrenoate potassium therapy we also observed a significant decrease in internal Na content (P less than 0.01), together with a significant increase in Na+-K+ pump (P less than 0.02) and Na+-Li+ countertransport (P less than 0.05) activities.", 
    "337": "In 12 essential hypertensive patients insufficiently controlled by treatment with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide, the blood pressure lowering effect of the addition of 25 mg captopril once daily was examined. Twenty four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed using portable automatic recording devices before treatment, after 4 weeks of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide alone, and again after 4 weeks of combined treatment with captopril. The combined treatment yielded a marked additional blood pressure reduction in comparison with the previous medication of the diuretic alone. The additional antihypertensive effect of captopril lasted 24 hours. During the daytime between 08.00 h and 20.00 h the mean blood pressure was 158 +/- 13/100 +/- 8 mmHg before treatment. After treatment with hydrochlorothiazide alone it was 151 +/- 11/93 +/- 8 mmHg and after hydrochlorothiazide and captopril it was 140 +/- 13/88 +/- 9 mmHg. Our results indicate that the addition of only 25 mg captopril once a day to a diuretic may result in a marked additional blood pressure reduction or normalization in cases of insufficient control by the diuretic alone.", 
    "338": "The effect of captopril 25 to 50 mg twice daily on 24 h blood pressures was compared with placebo in 14 patients with essential hypertension. Captopril was started in a dose of 25 mg b.d. in all patients. This dose was increased to 50 mg b.d. in those patients whose blood pressure was not normalized after 4 weeks (group II, n = 5), while in the others the same dose was continued (group I, n = 9). Blood pressure was measured at the end of the placebo period and after 8 weeks captopril, both in the office with a random zero sphygmomanometer and ambulant at home with a portable automated non-invasive blood pressure measuring device (ICR). In comparing the ICR measurements with those made with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer good agreement between the two methods for both diastolic (r = 0.94, n = 110) and systolic (r = 0.96, n = 110) blood pressure was found. In group I office blood pressures (mean +/- s.e.m.) decreased from 166 +/- 7/100 +/- 3 mm Hg to 144 +/- 4/87 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). In group II these reductions were from 165 +/- 7/104 +/- 2 mm Hg to 152 +/- 5/90 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). During ambulatory monitoring, blood pressure was shown to have a circadian rhythm both on placebo and on captopril. Captopril 25 mg b.d. lowered blood pressure throughout the 24 h observation period, although these reductions were smaller at night than during the day. In group II comparable effects of captopril 50 mg b.d. were demonstrated. Captopril 25 to 50 mg twice daily adequately controls blood pressure in most patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "339": "We have previously demonstrated that chronic intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of captopril attenuates the development of hypertension in young SHR in association with a depression in whole animal reactivity to vasoactive agents and an increased baroreflex sensitivity. In the present study we analyzed vascular reactivity in perfused kidneys from SHR treated with captopril or vehicle to determine whether the depression in reactivity was due to changes in baroreflex activity or an effect on the vasculature. Captopril (1.25 micrograms/hr) was infused (osmotic mini pumps) for 4 weeks. Vascular reactivity to norepinephrine, angiotensin and vasopressin was assessed in isolated kidneys perfused with an artificial medium at constant flow. SHR treated with ICV captopril showed a significantly lower arterial pressure and basal renal vascular resistance than SHR treated with ICV vehicle or IV captopril. In addition, these rats showed decreased vascular reactivity to all vasoactive agents tested as signified by a shift in the dose-response curves to the right with an increase in threshold (ED16) and ED50. Kidneys from WKY treated with ICV captopril also showed a decrease in vascular reactivity in comparison to WKY treated with ICV vehicle. Our data suggest that captopril, through a central action, attenuates the development of hypertension by decreasing vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictors.", 
    "340": "A double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in 41 Indian men and women with hypertension to compare the antihypertensive effects of captopril and methyldopa. Twenty patients received 150 mg of captopril and 21 patients received 750 mg of methyldopa daily. The drugs were administered in three equally divided doses for four weeks. Blood pressure was measured after one, two, and four weeks of therapy. Relevant clinical and biochemical investigations were carried out before and after treatment. Sixteen patients given captopril and 11 given methyldopa responded to therapy. Among the captopril responders, initial mean systolic blood pressure (+/- SE) was 155 +/- 5.0 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was 105 +/- 2.1 mmHg. These values were reduced to 119 +/- 9.8 and 80 +/- 6.1 mmHg, respectively, after four weeks of therapy. Similarly, among the methyldopa responders, initial mean systolic blood pressure was 180 +/- 7.4 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was 112 +/- 3.8 mmHg. These values were reduced to 138 +/- 7.0 and 92 +/- 3.8 mmHg, respectively, after four weeks of therapy. The fall in the blood pressure in both groups was highly significant (P less than 0.001). None of the patients in either group had any clinically significant side effects. The results of this study suggest that monotherapy with captopril may be more effective than monotherapy with methyldopa in Indian hypertensives.", 
    "341": "The renal excretory function of rats was investigated under conditions of reduced extracellular fluid volume (ECV) obtained by peritoneal dialysis with isotonic glucose solution 10% of the body mass and using sodium-deficient diet (consisting of boiled rice) with intact renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and after angiotensin converting enzyme blockade by Captopril. The experiments were made on male Wistar rats placed in metabolic cages. The diuresis, the excretion of sodium, potassium, chlorine and osmotically active substances in spontaneously released urine were tested over a period of 6 hours. Captopril was administered with Alzet osmotic minipumps at 80 micrograms/h rate of infusion (in the experimental animals with peritoneal dialysis) and intraperitoneally 1 mg/kg (in the animals subjected to sodium-deficient diet). Blocking of the converting enzyme with Captopril was found to increase the diuresis, as well as the sodium and total osmotic excretion after peritoneal dialysis and under sodium-deficient regime. Blocking of RAS with Captopril reduced the adaptive possibilities of the organism in the cases of reduced ECV and sodium-deficient diet.", 
    "342": "The effect of captopril on arterial pressure, indices of renal function and renal function regulating factors was studied in 13 patients suffering from chronic glomerulonephritis with arterial hypertension. Captopril considerably decreased the expression of hypertension irrespective of the initial status of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. A prolonged use of captopril resulted in an increase in the renal blood flow, a considerable decrease in the resistance of the renal vessels. A transient decrease in a glomerular filtration value was noted on the first days of treatment. The use of captopril did not cause significant changes in sodium balance; potassium excretion with urine decreased, its concentration in the blood increased. Captopril caused a sharp increase in the blood renin activity, a decrease in aldosterone production and excretion and an increase in the synthesis of renal prostaglandins. Captopril was well tolerated by the patients, noticeable side effects were undetectable. Mechanisms of the hypotensive effect of the drug and mechanisms of its action on renal function were discussed.", 
    "343": "A comparative study of the effects of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and endralazine, a new vasodilator drug, were performed in a group of 20 homogeneous patients with moderate hypertension (WHO: phase I and II). Both drugs produced a marked (p less than 0.001) decrease in mean arterial pressure, but the drop in blood pressure levels and the percentage of patients free of side-effects (p less than 0.001) were greater in patients treated with endralazine. Neither drug affected the lipid profile, nor pulmonary function tests and both increased significantly (p less than 0.001) plasma renin activity levels. The results of this study suggest that both drugs may be recommended for the treatment of hypertensive asthmatic patients, but endralazine should be preferred as first-choice drug, due to its lower incidence of side-effects and higher hypotensive effect obtained with the administration of a lower daily dosage.", 
    "344": "Recent epidemiological studies have confirmed that high blood pressure increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality not only in young and middle-aged subjects but also in elderly patients. For this reason there is an increasing tendency to treat hypertension also in this age group. However in doing so several problems may be encountered, if the particular physiopathological characteristics of these patients are not taken into account. Recently captopril has been proposed as a useful agent in these cases since it does not reduce coronary, cerebral and renal blood flow and does not cause orthostatic hypotension. These properties are of the utmost importance because elderly patients often present a decreased renal function, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and an impaired baroreflex sensitivity. Although to date no controlled studies have been published on the use of captopril in hypertensives over 60 years old, the results of a recent captopril surveillance programme indicate that this agent is efficacious and well tolerated in these patients.", 
    "345": "In the pithed Wistar rats Captopril (2 mg/kg) decreased the mean arterial pressure (MAP) 21%. Further injection of a specific antagonist decreased the vasoconstrictor action of vasopressin (aAVP, 10 micrograms/kg) an additional 6%. Reversal in the order of drug administration did not change these percentages. The osmotic stimulus evoked by the infusion of hypertonic saline (ClNa 9%, 0.018 ml/min, 2 hr) significantly increased MAP, this increase being almost totally reversed by the aAVP (10 micrograms/kg). These findings suggest a greater role of the renin-angiotensin system than of the vasopressin (AVP) in the maintenance of MAP in the pithed rat; AVP, moreover, can be released by means of an osmotic stimulus.", 
    "346": "Nine children aged 2 months to 13 (mean 6.6) years with renal hypertension were treated with captopril. The treatment lasted for 1.5 to 14 months. Maintenance doses ranged between 1 and 5 mg/kg/day. Good effect was achieved with captopril in children with normal renal function and in mild renal insufficiency. In patients with end-stage renal disease when dialysis failed to maintain normal body water captopril was ineffective.", 
    "347": "Captopril was given to 42 hypertensive patients aged 1 to 17 years who were treated by regular haemodialysis because of terminal renal failure. Initially all patients were on antihypertensive treatment without sufficient control of blood pressure. Under captopril all patients presented a significant decrease of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The mean decrease of systolic blood pressure was from 162 to 114 and that of diastolic blood pressure from 106 to 86 mmHg. Plasma renin activity rose significantly in all cases whereas plasma aldosterone dropped and reached normal levels for age. The maximum effective dosage was 3 mg/kg/day. Total duration of treatment with captopril ranged from 1 1/2 to 6 1/12 (mean 3 2/12) years. At last observation the dosage of captopril varied between 0.3 and 3 mg/kg/day.", 
    "348": "Captopril was administered to three groups of hypertensive children and adolescents: patients with renal disease; neonates with umbilical artery related hypertension; and post-renal transplant patients. In older children with renal disease, increasing the captopril dose above 0.5 mg/kg did not improve the antihypertensive response. A maximal drug concentrations occurred one hour after dosing, and captopril concentration returned to predose levels by eight hours. Neonates responded to significantly lower doses of captopril (0.01-0.5 mg/kg) and the duration of response to higher doses appeared to be longer than that observed in older children. In post-renal transplant patients, blood pressure decreased after captopril in 94% of subjects, but in 62% a concomitant increase in serum creatinine was observed (correlation [r] = 0.55, p less than .02). This increase could not be correlated with renal biopsy histopathology. Thus, captopril has proven to be an effective antihypertensive agent in children over a broad age range and for a variety of clinical conditions.", 
    "349": "Adult Turner syndrome (TS) patients frequently present hypertension. To clarify the pathogenesis of this hypertension we examined the blood pressure (BP) behaviour and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in 31 TS patients (2-22 years of age). BP levels were occasionally elevated in 47% of the subjects and constantly elevated in 23%. Most of the patients were on estrogen replacement therapy, but 26% of them presented with elevated levels since childhood. Supine and upright plasma renin activity (PRA) values were higher in TS compared to controls and more elevated in hypertensive TS than in the normotensive ones. At Captopril challenge TS showed different PRA responses regardless of the karyotype and clinical features. Patients on estrogen therapy, however, exhibited higher increments of PRA after Captopril.", 
    "350": "TS patients show high frequency of hypertension in pediatric age. Estrogen therapy is an outbreaking and worsening factor. An estrogen independent role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the pathogenesis of TS hypertension is still uncertain.", 
    "351": "In the present study 25 patients with various forms of severe hypertension (essential hypertension: n = 12; renovascular hypertension: n = 11; unilateral small kidney: n = 2), which were treated with captopril for a mean control period of 34.9 months, were investigated. Reduction of mean blood pressure under captopril was comparable in all subgroups. However, patients with renovascular hypertension showed a significant increase in serum creatinine from 117 to 162 mumol/l (p less than 0.05) after 34.9 months, whereas in essential hypertensives even a slight decrease could be observed (113 vs. 111 mumol/l). Serum creatinine of the 2 patients with unilateral small kidney remained within the normal range. Changes in creatinine were markedly higher in cases with bilateral renal artery stenosis and/or in those with a very high initial plasma renin activity (greater than 15 ng/ml X 3 h). Our findings underline the necessity of cautious application of captopril in patients with renovascular hypertension.", 
    "352": "Hemodynamic and hormonal actions of acute (50 mg) and chronic (150 mg/day) captopril were tested in 10 patients with essential hypertension. Under short-term conditions blood pressure was reduced, heart rate and plasma adrenaline did not change, plasma angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone decreased. Plasma renin activity, basal plasma noradrenaline and bicyclo-PGEm, a novel stable metabolite of prostaglandin E2, increased after captopril. With chronic captopril treatment blood pressure was reduced after 4 weeks before readministration of captopril, heart rate did not change, plasma renin activity and bicyclo-PGEm remained elevated for 12 h after the last captopril dose. Angiotensin II remained suppressed, aldosterone and plasma catecholamines did not change between doses. Readministration of captopril led to a further reduction in blood pressure. Angiotensin II and aldosterone were further suppressed, bicyclo-PGEm levels increased from a higher baseline. Heart rate and plasma catecholamines did not change. Taken together, the results suggest that prostaglandin E2 is involved in the acute and chronic hypotensive response of captopril in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "353": "The effects of Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on pulmonary hemodynamics and blood gases were studied in 9 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) and pulmonary hypertension (PA-P greater than 20 mm Hg). Hemodynamic data were recorded prior to Captopril administration (50 mg per os) and for the next 60 min. Following Captopril administration, significant reductions in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PA-P) (p less than 0.05), in mean pulmonary wedge pressure (PW-P) (p less than 0.05), and in total pulmonary resistance (TPR) were noted; significant reductions in mean brachial artery pressure (BA-P) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were also recorded, while cardiac output, heart rate and blood gas tensions showed no significant changes. Furthermore, the higher the hypoxemia, the greater was the reduction in BA-P (p less than 0.05). We therefore feel that Captopril, when administered to COLD patients with pulmonary hypertension, may protect the pulmonary circulation from hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.", 
    "354": "The effect of captopril on renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), plasma concentrations of renin, angiotensin II (Ang II), aldosterone (Aldo) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), serum osmolality (Sosm), free water clearance (CLH2O), fractional urinary excretion of electrolytes and blood pressure (BP), was examined in 10 patients with moderate essential hypertension. Placebo plus furosemide was given for 6 weeks, followed by a 6-week period on captopril and furosemide. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was partly blocked by captopril, resulting in a 18% fall in BP. GFR was reduced by 8% during captopril treatment, whereas RPF remained unchanged. Water loading-induced suppression of Ang II and AVP was inhibited by captopril therapy. Without affecting BP in the placebo period, water loading almost abolished the captopril-induced reduction in BP. It is concluded that non-acute captopril treatment of moderates essential hypertension reduces GFR slightly, possibly by producing dilatation of efferent arterioles. The antipressor effect of captopril is lessened during volume expansion, which may be secondary to reduced activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and osmoregulatory systems.", 
    "355": "In Inactin-anaesthetized rats inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme by captopril resulted in a small decrease in mean arterial blood pressure accompanied by increases in the rates of glomerular filtration, water and electrolyte excretion. Infusion (100 pmol/min) of sar1-leu8-angiotensin II (sar1-leu8-AII) during continuing converting enzyme blockade reversed these changes in renal function but had no effect on arterial blood pressure. The data indicate that sar1-leu8-AII has partial agonist activity in the kidney although it acts as an antagonist of AII in the systemic circulation. This supports the proposal that angiotensin receptors within the kidney differ from those in the peripheral circulation.", 
    "356": "Changes in plasma active and inactive renin concentration (ARC and IRC) after captopril administration and angiotensin II (AII) infusion were studied in six patients with Bartter's syndrome. A single oral dose of captopril (8-25 mg) lowered the blood pressure and increased both ARC and IRC. AII infusion elevated blood pressure, suppressed ARC and increased IRC. In this syndrome of high renin levels, infused AII appeared to increase inactive renin secretion by reducing its conversion to active renin. On the other hand, an acute fall in AII levels and/or renal perfusion pressure by captopril increased both active and inactive renin. This indicates that the increase in the secretion of inactive renin, stimulated by captopril, might exceed any increase in its conversion to active renin in patients with Bartter's syndrome, in whom the production of renin is accelerated, and conversion of inactive renin to active renin probably already operates near its maximum.", 
    "357": "To examine the relationships between the central and peripheral renin angiotensin system in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt renovascular hypertension (RVH), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), SQ 14225 (captopril) was administered intraventricularly (IVT) and intravenously (IV) in the alternative manner and their combination. Also, the effects of IVT captopril on the peripheral sympathetic nervous system were evaluated using an intravenous injection of prazosin. IVT captopril induced a significant reduction of blood pressure in both types hypertensive rats but not in normotensive rats. Greater depressor effects of IV captopril not IV prazosin following IVT captopril were observed in RVH compared to those in SHR. These results indicate that the pressor action of the brain renin angiotensin system is closely related with the sympathetic nervous system in hypertensive conditions and that these functions are independent from the peripheral renin angiotensin system. Furthermore, their roles were different in different types of experimental hypertension in rats.", 
    "358": "A renin-producing juxtaglomerular cell tumor was found in a 27 year-old woman. The infusion of angiotensin II analogue produced a marked decrease in arterial pressure. Oral administration of captopril also reduced her blood pressure. Although the renal vein renin did not indicate the laterality of the tumor, unilateral partial nephrectomy cured the disease. This is the first case report to describe measurement of several hemodynamic parameters before and after surgical removal of a juxtaglomerular cell tumor.", 
    "359": "To investigate the antihypertensive mechanism of 1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine (alacepril, DU-1219) a novel orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, we studied the inhibitory activity of alacepril and DU-1227 (desacetyl-alacepril, a metabolite of alacepril) on the norepinephrine (noradrenaline, NA)-induced vasoconstrictive and pressor response in vitro and in vivo, and compared with that of captopril. Alacepril and captopril (3 X 10(-4) mol/l) attenuated slightly the NA-induced contractile response in isolated rat thoracic aorta and mesenteric artery, however, DU-1227 (3 X 10(-4) mol/l) inhibited more strongly the response in main artery and peripheral vascular bed. Orally given alacepril (18.7 mg/kg) inhibited the NA-induced pressor response in conscious normotensive rats, and the activity was more potent and long-lasting than that of an equimolar dose of captopril (10 mg/kg). After oral administration in hypertensive rats challenged with NA, alacepril (1.87 to 18.7 mg/kg) showed a dose-related antihypertensive effect which was slower in onset and longer lasting than that of equimolar dose of captopril (1.0 to 10.0 mg/kg). Consequently, the reduced sensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system in peripheral vasculature might contribute partly to the antihypertensive mechanism of alacepril.", 
    "360": "Effects of 1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine (alacepril, DU-1219) a new orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on cardiovascular system in experimental animals were examined. In conscious renal hypertensive dogs, alacepril (3 mg/kg p.o.) caused a marked reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR), but did not change significantly heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), cardiac work (CW) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Captopril (3 mg/kg, p.o.) showed similar changes in cardiovascular parameters as alacepril. In anesthetized open-chest normotensive dogs, alacepril (3-100 micrograms/kg/min for 10 min, i.v. infusion) tended to decrease DBP and TPR, but did not change significantly CO, stroke work (SW), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), dp/dt and HR. Captopril also showed similar effects but these changes were greater in extent than those of alacepril. In conscious renal hypertensive rats, alacepril did not affect the regional cerebral blood flow in the frontal cortex and the dorsal hippocampus after single (3 and 10 mg/kg) and successive (3 mg/kg/d for 7 days) oral administration. Captopril (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased blood flow in the frontal cortex after single oral administration. In conscious normotensive dogs, alacepril (3 and 30 mg/kg p.o.) increased renal plasma flow (RPF), urine volume (UV), urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) and urinary Na+/k+ ratio, but did not change glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary potassium excretion (UKV). Captopril (3 and 30 mg/kg p.o.) also showed similar changes as alacepril. These effects of alacepril on cardiovascular system resemble those of captopril and might be considered as a favourable profile for the antihypertensive agent.", 
    "361": "The effects of 1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine (alacepril, DU-1219), an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the central nervous and sensory systems and on several other functions were compared with those of captopril in the experimental animals. Alacepril at the high oral dose of 600 mg/kg prolonged the hexobarbital sleeping time and potentiated the reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice. However, alacepril at the same dose did not affect the general behavior, convulsions induced by maximal electroshock, pentetrazol and strychnine, active avoidance in mice and body temperature in rats. In addition, alacepril (200 mg/kg i.v.) has little effect on general behavior in mice. Captopril at over 107 mg/kg p.o. produced eyelid closure and at 320 mg/kg prolonged the hexobarbital sleeping time. A metabolite of alacepril, desacetylalacepril (DU-1227) (200 mg/kg i.v.), caused salivation in mice. Alacepril and DU-1227 at 60 mg/kg i.v. were without effect on flexor reflex and spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) in cats, while captopril at the equimolar dose depressed the flexor reflex and showed a tendency to increase the beta 2-band relative power of the cortical EEG. Alacepril and captopril neither affected the writhing syndrome induced by acetic acid nor that by phenylquinone in mice. Local anesthetic and irritant activities in rabbits and effect on neuromuscular junction in anesthetized rats were not observed with the two compounds. Alacepril at the oral dose of 0.1 mg/kg potentiated the carrageenin-induced edema in rats. However, the effect was one third that of captopril. Alacepril and captopril did not affect the increased vascular permeability by acetic acid in mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "362": "The effects of 1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine (alacepril, DU-1219) an antihypertensive compound with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory activity, and its metabolite, desacetyl-alacepril (DU-1227), on the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems and on the blood were compared with those of captopril in the experimental animals. Alacepril and DU-1227 at the i.v. dose of 10 mg/kg gradually lowered the diastolic blood pressure in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. Captopril showed similar effects. However, the former two compounds showed triphasic effects on the carotid blood flow, i.e., transient increase immediately after the injection, second increase 2 min later, and gradual decrease 20-30 min later. The second increase by DU-1227 was more potent than that by alacepril. Alacepril, DU-1227 and captopril did not affect the pressor responses induced by norepinephrine in anesthetized cats. The contractions of the nictitating membrane in cats induced by electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve or epinephrine were depressed with high doses of these three compounds. Captopril potentiated the contractions induced by bradykinin in isolated guinea-pig ileum, while alacepril and DU-1227 were without effect. These three compounds neither affected the resting tension of isolated ileum in guinea-pigs and rabbits nor the contractions induced by acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin and nicotine of isolated guinea-pig ileum. Alacepril at the oral dose of 60 mg/kg decreased the total acidity in pylorus ligated rats, and at higher doses depressed the intestinal charcoal meal passage in mice. Alacepril at comparatively low doses decreased the urine volume with slight reduction of Na+ and K+ excretions in saline-loaded rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "363": "Disposition and metabolism of 1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine (alacepril, DU-1219) in rats were studied and compared to those of 1-[(S)-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-proline (captopril), using 14C-labeled compounds. Some tissue homogenates and plasma of rats were incubated in vitro with [14C]alacepril or [14C]captopril at the concentration of 50 nmol/ml. For in vivo studies, radioactive agents were orally or intravenously administered to rats in doses of 46 mumol/kg (18.7 and 10 mg/kg for alacepril and captopril, respectively) or 460 mumol/kg. In vitro studies revealed that [14C]alacepril is converted to captopril via desacetyl-alacepril (DU-1227) in the liver, kidney and intestine homogenates, but not in the lung homogenate and plasma where deacetylation alone occurred. DU-1227 and captopril formed were found to be partly bound with endogenous -SH compounds i.e. cysteine, glutathione and probably, protein. 1 h after oral administration of [14C]alacepril, plasma levels of total radioactivity reached a maximum of 8 nmol/ml and disappeared with t1/2 of 2.6 h. [14C]Captopril radioactivity was maximum (13 nmol/ml) at 40 min with the disappearance t1/2 of 1.9 h. Similarly to total radioactivity, levels of radioactivity unbound and bound to plasma protein after [14C]alacepril were lower at maximum and disappeared more slowly than those after [14C]captopril. After oral administration of [14C]alacepril, DU-1227, captopril and mixed disulfides of captopril with cysteine and glutathione were detected in the plasma unbound fraction. The three metabolites except for DU-1227 were commonly detected after [14C]captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "364": "Acute renal failure (ARF) was induced in 35 week-old conscious female Wistar rats, by intramuscular (IM) injection of glycerol. Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of imidazole, an inhibitor of thromboxane (TXA2) synthesis, partially protected the animals against ARF. This protection was accompanied by a significant decrease in renal TXB2 (the stable chemical metabolite of TXA2) and a significant increase in renal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable chemical metabolite of PGI2) synthesis. Intraperitoneal injection of captopril (SQ 14225) an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, did not protect the animals against ARF. This lack of protection was accompanied by a significant increase in renal TXB2 and a significant decrease in renal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha synthesis. The results suggest that: (a) the renin-angiotensin (R-A) system does not play a role, or has only a secondary one in the development of ARF; (b) thromboxane A2 (the most potent vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator agent known) is the preponderant agent responsible for the development of this pathological syndrome.", 
    "365": "The progression of adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats was studied over a 3-month period. The effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on this model of renal disease, was also studied. Two weeks following a single iv injection of adriamycin, rats were divided into two treatment groups: one received a daily po dose of captopril and the other received a placebo. Measurements of renal function were performed at 4, 8, and 11 weeks following the initiation of therapy. Necropsies and light microscopic evaluation of the kidneys were performed at the end of the treatment period. Functional and morphologic alterations in both groups of rats were compared to each other and to normal age/weight-matched control rats studied over the same time period. At 13 weeks following the administration of adriamycin, both treatment groups had significant renal dysfunction when compared to normal controls. In addition to severe proteinuria, rats receiving adriamycin exhibited polyuria, polydipsia, increased plasma urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine, and decreased endogenous creatinine clearance. They had severe generalized kidney lesions characterized by tubular dilation and atrophy, cast formation, interstitial fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltration, and focal, global glomerulosclerosis. The histopathologic ranking of the kidneys was correlated with some antemortem laboratory parameters but not with the degree of proteinuria. Captopril had no ameliorating effects on the progression of renal disease. Certain findings indicate that captopril may actually have promoted the deterioration of renal function. We conclude that adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome in the rat is a progressive disease resulting in generalized renal dysfunction, and that captopril, at the dose given in this experiment, is unable to slow the progression of the disease.", 
    "366": "Hypertension is a common feature of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and constitutes a major risk factor for accelerated cardiovascular disease and premature death. While a reduction in the incidence and severity of hypertension is one potential benefit of kidney transplantation, hypertension often remains as a problem after transplantation, even in recipients of wellfunctioning allografts. Despite many studies of the underlying etiologic factors, the mechanisms implicated in post-transplant hypertension are still incompletely understood. A number of variables, including status of the diseased native kidneys, steriod therapy, rejection, recurrence of original disease, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, sodium and calcium metabolism, and transplant renal artery stenosis may play a role in the etiology of hypertension after transplantation. Patients with persistent high blood pressure for more than 3 months after transplantation should be thoroughly investigated, with controlled sodium intake so that proper medical or surgical therapy can be implemented. Since sodium restriction, radionuclide renal scanning, renin levels, or responses to saralasin or captopril may not provide a clear index of various possibilities, an accurate differential diagnosis my also require invasive procedures such as arteriography and/or renal biopsy.", 
    "367": "To assess the effect of potent vasodilator therapy in patients with severe or resistant hypertension, 10 patients underwent therapy with captopril and nifedipine alone and in combination. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and blood chemistry values were monitored for 4 weeks during captopril monotherapy and after 8 weeks during combination therapy with captopril and nifedipine. Compared with baseline, the BP decreased during captopril monotherapy (180 +/- 11/98 +/- 7 vs. 209 +/- 16/118 +/- 12 mm Hg; P less than 0.005). After the addition of nifedipine, the BP was further reduced (148 +/- 23/85 +/- 16 mm Hg), but there was no change in heart rate. In three patients not achieving the diastolic BP goal during combination therapy with dosing every 8 hours, automatic 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring demonstrated lack of antihypertensive control for only the last 2 to 3 hours of the dosing interval. These data demonstrate that combination therapy with captopril and nifedipine is effective in patients with severe hypertension, but frequent dosing intervals are necessary for adequate antihypertensive control.", 
    "368": "This study examined the effects of kidney tubule lumen obstruction on glomerular blood flow (GBF) in anesthetized rats. GBF was estimated using microspheres having 9 micron diameter and averaged 239 +/- 10 nl/min in normal nephrons of 41 control rats. Tubule blockade with either paraffin wax or castor oil produced identical results. GBF after 1-2 h of obstruction did not differ from normal. After 1 day, GBF averaged two-thirds of normal, and after 1 wk GBF averaged one-third of normal. The hemodynamic changes produced by obstruction for 1 wk were diminished by chronic administration of high doses of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or acute administration of the angiotensin antagonist saralasin. The results suggest that angiotensin contributes to the vasoconstriction produced by prolonged obstruction. Nephrons blocked with castor oil contained oil 1 wk later, had a GBF of 88 +/- 24 nl/min, and were atrophied. We conclude that chronic single nephron obstruction produces progressive vasoconstriction, that this response is in part angiotensin mediated, and that the end result is nephron atrophy.", 
    "369": "To compare the responses to oral inotropic and vasodilator drugs, maximally effective doses of amrinone (300 mg over 3 hours) and captopril (25 mg orally) were administered to 21 patients with severe chronic heart failure, who had not received either agent previously. Despite similar decreases in systemic vascular resistance with both drugs, amrinone produced greater increases in cardiac index (+ 0.56 vs. + 0.41/min/m2, p less than 0.05) and smaller decreases in mean arterial pressure (-11.1 vs. -15.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) than did captopril; three patients became symptomatically hypotensive with captopril, but none did so after amrinone. These differences were due to a significant decrease in heart rate with captopril (-6.3 beats/min, p less than 0.01), whereas heart rate increased with amrinone (+ 4.3 beats/min, p less than 0.01); the increases in stroke volume index with both drugs were similar. Despite similar decreases in left ventricular filling pressures, the decrease in mean right atrial pressure with amrinone was greater than with captopril (-5.6 vs. -3.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). This difference was the result of the greater decrease in pulmonary arteriolar resistance, and hence in right ventricular afterload, with amrinone than with captopril, (-33% vs. -16%, respectively), p less than 0.01. Despite these superior hemodynamic responses to amrinone, when patients received sequential long-term treatment with both drugs during the follow-up period, only 12% of patients benefitted during therapy with amrinone, whereas 64% improved clinically with captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "370": "Enzyme inhibitors selected from either natural product screening or synthetic chemistry programmes can be characterized according to a number of criteria to determine their usefulness as potential drug candidates. Inhibition may be classified as either irreversible or reversible. Irreversible inhibitors may be described with respect to first order rate constants or half-times for inactivation. Reversible inhibitors should be evaluated with respect to Ki values rather than I50 values. Assays should be designed using the simplest and most precise procedures available. If possible, assays utilizing continuously-recording methods should be selected. When reversible inhibitors are desired, greater sensitivity for inhibition is achieved using low substrate concentrations. For irreversible inhibitors or tight-binding competitive inhibitors, low enzyme concentrations also result in greater inhibitory sensitivity. The order of addition of enzyme and substrate should be varied to determine whether inhibition requires preincubation of enzyme and inhibitor for maximum effect. Time-dependence of inhibition should also be established. Enzyme inhibitors should be specific for the enzyme that is being targeted. Novel competitive inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme were isolated in the author's laboratory using the above philosophy of screening for enzyme inhibitors. The properties of the muraceins, phenacein and aspergillomarasmine A' are discussed.", 
    "371": "Thirteen hypetensive non-insulin dependent diabetics (9 male, 4 female, mean age 61.6 +/- 6 years) were given 6 weeks treatment with captopril in a dose range 75-150 mg/day. Each patient underwent a standard glucose tolerance test and had blood pressure profiles recorded before and after captopril. Supine systolic blood pressure (mmHg) improved from 181 (+/- 16) to 162 (+/- 17) and diastolic blood pressure from 103 (+/- 11) to 89 (+/- 9). A similar improvement was seen in erect systolic (174 +/- 19 to 156 +/- 19) and diastolic (103 +/- 14 to 87 +/- 11) blood pressures. Following treatment there was no significant change in glucose tolerance although the 120 minute plasma glucose value improved from 15.3 +/- 4.2 to 13.9 +/- 3.4 mmol/l (P less than 0.05). The drug was well tolerated and free of adverse effects. Captopril would therefore appear to be an effective and safe anti-hypertensive agent in non-insulin dependent diabetes and did not result in any deterioration of glucose tolerance.", 
    "372": "A series of 8 adult patients with stable bronchial asthma and an established diagnois of essential hypertension (WHO I and II) was studied in a randomized double-blind cross-over study to assess the effect of captopril (50-100 mg/day) and verapamil (160-240 mg/day) on blood pressure, lung function and asthmatic symptoms. The effect of the medication on blood pressure was significant with a mean of 137/86 mmHg and 148/90 mmHg after 4 weeks on captopril and verapamil, respectively, with fewer orthostatic changes caused by captopril. There were no marked changes of asthmatic symptoms or peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements during the trial.", 
    "373": "The haemodynamic pattern of the common carotid artery was studied before and after administration of captopril isosorbide dinitrate and nitrendipine, in men with sustained essential hypertension. Pulsed Doppler methods were used. Captopril produced both a fall in vascular resistance and an increase in the arterial diameter of the common carotid artery. Thus, in the common carotid artery circulation of patients with essential hypertension only captopril dilated both small and large arteries.", 
    "374": "A randomized, double-blind study was undertaken to compare atenolol and captopril as second-step agents in the treatment of essential hypertension resistant to 5 mg bendrofluazide daily. Using a cross-over technique 28 patients were administered each drug sequentially for periods of 8 weeks with an intervening washout period of 2 weeks. Both drugs produced a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01). Captopril was more effective than atenolol at reducing diastolic pressure (P less than 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the systolic pressure. Neither drug produced side effects of a serious nature, but untoward symptoms were more frequent with atenolol. The effect of the drugs on myocardial function was assessed by comparing pre-treatment with post-treatment left ventricular ejection fractions, both at rest and with exercise, measured by MUGA scan. The resting ejection fraction was unaffected by either drug. During exercise, on captopril, the ejection fraction showed the normal increase over the resting baseline, but on atenolol there was no such increase.", 
    "375": "In a cross-over study in 26 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension The antihypertensive efficacy of captopril 25 mg b.i.d., nifedipine 20 mg b.i.d. and the combination both drugs in non-responders to monotherapy was compared. Of 26 captropril-treated patients 7 were non-responders and needed the addition of nifedipine; of 26 nifedipine-treated patients 3 needed additional captopril. Seven out of 26 patients treated with captopril, 22/26 patients given nifedipine and 9/10 patients receiving the combination reported side effects. In 3 nifedipine patients, 1 captopril patient and 1 patient on both drugs, treatment had to be stopped because of side effects. Captopril and nifedipine in these doses are about equally effective both after acute and chronic administration. The response-rate is somewhat higher with nifedipine, but the side effects are significantly less with captopril. There was no significant additive effect with the combination of the two drugs.", 
    "376": "Forty two children with end stage renal failure and hypertension on chronic haemodialysis have been treated with captopril for from 18 to 78 months. Satisfactory control has been obtained in doses of 0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg given every 24 or 48 hours. Tolerance was good. The results of the present study suggest that captopril is a suitable drug for long-term use in paediatric patients."
