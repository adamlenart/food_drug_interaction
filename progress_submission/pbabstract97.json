    "0": "Kidney renin concentrations were significantly lower in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) than in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. After treatment of both SHR and WKY rats with captopril (100 mg/kg p.o. for 3 months), kidney renin concentration increased dramatically in SHR and slightly, but significantly, in WKY. After captopril treatment, kidney renin content of SHR was still significantly lower than WKY. Because of the lower content of kidney renin in SHR and the proportionately greater increase in kidney renin content in SHR after captopril treatment than in WKY, it is proposed that a fundamental difference(s) in the control of the renin-angiotensin system exists in SHR, an effect which may or may not be related to SHR hypertension.", 
    "1": "The acute effects of captopril on haemodynamics, coronary flow and myocardial metabolism were studied in 12 patients with chronic severe cardiac failure (primary cardiomyopathy: 10 cases; ischaemic: 2 cases) in functional Classes III or IV of the NYHA. All patients were male and their average age was 51.3 +/- 14.1 years (range 27 to 68 years). Measurements were carried out under basal conditions and 90 minutes after a single dose of 50 mg (5 cases) or 100 mg (7 cases) of captopril. Captopril administration leads to an increase in cardiac index from 2.05 +/- 0.32 to 2.34 +/- 0.35 l/min/m2 (p less than 0.05) and a greater increase in systolic index from 23.9 +/- 6.7 to 29.8 +/- 6.9 ml/syst/m2 (p less than 0.01), because the heart rate decreased slightly (p less than 0.05). These changes were the result of a decrease in afterload: mean aortic pressure fell from 85 +/- 11.8 to 68 +/- 19.6 mmHg (p less than 0.01) and systemic arterial resistance fell from 2 886 +/- 745 to 2 010 +/- 610 dynes/cm-5/sec/m-2 (p less than 0.01). Captopril also led to a fall in venous tone, i.e. pre-load: left ventricular end diastolic pressure fell from 26.9 +/- 6.1 to 20.8 +/- 6.6 mmHg: p less than 0.01. There was no change in contractility as shown by the absence of variation of the V.max (0.92 +/- 0.18 under basal conditions, and 0.90 +/- 0.15 after 90 minutes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "To study long-term effects of captopril on renal function in patients with various forms of severe hypertension, serum creatinine values were monitored in 76 patients under captopril therapy over a period of up to 3 years. Three different groups were formed: patients with essential hypertension (n = 37); patients with renovascular hypertension (n = 20); patients with renal parenchymatous hypertension (n = 19). In each of the three groups reduction in blood pressure was accompanied by increases in serum creatinine. However, both changes were more pronounced in patients with renovascular hypertension. In this group only the rise in creatinine was statistically significant and showed a slight progression with duration of captopril treatment. Group specific analysis revealed that the increase was smaller in patients with unilateral (n = 16) renovascular disease than in those with bilateral (n = 4) involvement, but in the former it was still significantly higher than in patients with essential or renal parenchymatous hypertension. Separation of patients according to the underlying disease of renovascular hypertension showed that renal function deteriorated less in patients with arteriosclerotic origin (n = 10) than in those with fibromuscular dysplasia (n = 8). Statistical evaluation of subjects with renovascular and essential hypertension still revealed significant differences in creatinine when the patients with initial plasma renin activity (PRA) below and above 6 ng/ml X 3 h were compared separately. A significant correlation (r = 0.73; P less than 0.05) between blood pressure reduction and creatinine changes was obtained only for patients with renovascular hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was administered for up to 11 weeks to three patients with progressive systemic sclerosis presenting with hypertension and plasma creatinine levels of 3.1, 7.2 and 10.4 mg/100 ml. Only one patient had malignant phase hypertension. In this patient a diuretic had to be added to captopril in order to keep blood pressure under control. Despite sustained blood pressure control during captopril administration, renal function deteriorated and hemodialysis treatment had to be started in all patients. Up to that time no substantial improvement in skin lesions was observed. During the period of dialysis, blood pressure was normal in all patients even though administration of captopril was discontinued. All three patients died of respiratory failure while on chronic hemodialysis for 3 to 4 weeks. These observations confirm that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may be helpful in controlling blood pressure of patients with scleroderma. However, in contrast to some earlier reports, they also indicate that converting enzyme inhibition does not always prevent the multivisceral vascular lesions of scleroderma.",

The captopril is then treated with N-ethylmaleimide, purified on XAD-2 resin, eluted with ethyl acetate, and methylated prior to its determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring. The limit of detection is 20 ng/mL of plasma.", 
    "5": "The resting membrane potential of tail arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto controls (WKYs) was compared. At 4-5 weeks old, the blood pressure and resting membrane potential of the SHRs was not significantly different from the WKYs. The blood pressure of 8- to 10-week-old SHRs increased significantly to 183 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa) from 127 mmHg at 4 weeks, and the membrane potential decreased from 60 to 51 mV. At 15 weeks of age, the blood pressure of the SHRs was 193 mmHg and the membrane potential was 49 mV. In WKYs, there was no significant change in membrane potential with age. The decrease in membrane potential in the SHRs is due to a decrease in the ouabain-sensitive electrogenic pumping. Chronic treatment of the SHRs with captopril (100 mg . kg-1 . day-1) prevented the increase in blood pressure and the decrease in membrane potential.", 
    "6": "The effects of captopril (50 or 100 mg t.i.d.) with and without hydrochlorothiazide (25 or 50 mg/day) on renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and the renin-angiotensin system were determined in 20 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Normalization of blood pressure (supine diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) was achieved in 12 patients after four or six weeks of captopril alone (147 +/- 3/100 +/- 3 mm Hg after a two-week placebo lead-in vs. 135 +/- 4/83 +/- 1 mm Hg after captopril, P less than 0.01/P less than 0.001). In these 12 patients, no significant alterations in renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate were observed. Plasma renin activity increased two- to threefold above baseline levels, whereas serum and urinary aldosterone decreased by 23 and 35 per cent, respectively. Eight other patients remained hypertensive after four weeks of captopril alone (165 +/- 6/110 +/- 3 vs. 156 +/- 8/102 +/- 4 mmHg, P greater than 0.05/P less than 0.05). With addition of hydrochlorothiazide, blood pressure fell (P less than 0.001) to 129 +/- 7/84 +/- 3 mm Hg. Captopril alone or in combination with diuretic had no significant effect on renal hemodynamics. In the eight patients requiring diuretic, plasma renin activity remained constant after captopril monotherapy, but rose threefold after hydrochlorothiazide was added. The combination of these two antihypertensive agents significantly lowered serum aldosterone levels and urinary aldosterone excretion by 53 and 50 per cent, respectively. In summary, captopril with and without a thiazide diuretic reduced blood pressure without altering renal hemodynamics.", 
    "7": "We describe an elderly man, with pre-existing renal failure and atheromatous renal artery stenosis, who developed persistent anuria due to renal artery thrombosis after acute hypotension following captopril administration. Caution should be used when captopril is first administered to patients with impaired renal function in whom renal artery stenosis is known or suspected.", 
    "8": "Subcutaneous injections of [des-Asp1]-angiotensin I [( des-Asp1]-AI), angiotensin II (AII), and angiotensin III (AIII) induced drinking in the laboratory rat and the South American rodent Octodon degus, but not in the gerbil. In a second experiment, pretreatment with captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, prevented the endogenous conversion of subcutaneously injected [des-Asp1]-AI to AIII and prevented drinking in rats and degus. The pharmacological artifact of hypovolemia caused by angiotensin-induced increases in vascular permeability was not observed in members of these species. In a final experiment blood pressure changes resulting from subcutaneous injections of AII and AIII in rats and gerbils were measured. Significant pressor elevations were seen following the administration of both analogues, although AII was more potent. These results demonstrate that AIII is dipsogenic in rats and degus and serves as a pressor agent in rats and gerbils. No ready explanation is available for the gerbil's relative lack of dipsogenicity to the presently tested angiotensins.", 
    "9": "Angiotensin II and aldosterone increase in response to sodium deficiency to promote sodium and water conservation. In addition, they may act synergistically to arouse a sodium appetite. If so, then blockade of endogenous angiotensin should decrease the appetite. In experiments reported here, captopril (SQ 14,225) was given peripherally to rats to block conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. It both enhanced and suppressed sodium depletion-induced sodium appetite. The appetite was suppressed when captopril was given in high doses, which block conversion centrally as well as peripherally. The same doses of captopril had no effect on urinary sodium excretion or on sodium appetite aroused by mineralocorticoid treatment. Low doses, which block conversion only in the periphery, enhanced salt intake elicited by depletion, and the enhancement was abolished by captopril given directly into the brain. Therefore the enhancement was probably due to a captopril-induced increase of peripheral angiotensin I, which gained access to the brain and was converted there to angiotensin II.", 
    "10": "We investigated the effects of Na+ intake, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) on K+ balance during 3 days of frusemide administration to six normal subjects. Subjects received 40 mg of frusemide for 3 days during three different protocols: Na+ intake 270 mmol/day (high salt); Na+ intake 20 mmol/day to stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (low salt); Na+ intake 270 mmol/day plus captopril (25 mg/6 h) to prevent activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In a fourth protocol, a water load was given during high salt intake to prevent ADH release and then frusemide was given. During high salt intake, frusemide increased K+ excretion (UKV) over 3 h, but the loss was counterbalanced by subsequent renal K+ retention so that daily K+ balance was neutral. During low salt intake, the magnitude of the acute kaliuresis following the first dose of frusemide and the slope of the linear relationship between UKV and the log of frusemide excretion were increased compared with that found during the high salt intake. In addition, low salt intake abolished the compensatory renal retention of K+ after frusemide and cumulative K+ balance over 3 days of diuretic administration was uniformly negative (-86 +/- 7 mmol/3 days; P less than 0.001). Captopril abolished the rise in plasma aldosterone concentration induced by frusemide. The acute kaliuresis after frusemide was unchanged compared with that observed during high salt intake. The compensatory reduction in UKV occurring after the diuretic was slightly potentiated. In fact, captopril given without the diuretic induced a small positive K+ balance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Nifedipine (10 mg qid) and captopril (25 mg qid) were tested alone and in combination in 14 patients suffering from severe primary hypertension. Each study period was of 1 week's duration. Circulatory response was evaluated through hourly pressure and pulse rate readings. The fall in pressure after oral nifedipine was maximal within 1 hr or less and was generally accompanied by palpitation and increase in pulse rate; with a six hourly dosing regimen the tendency of blood pressure to recover after each dose was interrupted by the next dose, so that values remained significantly reduced throughout the 24 hr, although pressure fluctuations were evident. Promptness of the antihypertensive action of captopril was similar, but the magnitude and the duration of the fall in pressure were less pronounced. When the converting-enzyme inhibitor was combined with the calcium-channel blocker, pressure fluctuations were not abolished, but the antihypertensive response was definitely enhanced, so that normal blood pressure was maintained for several hours during the day. Additional positive effects of captopril were mitigation of the heart rate reaction and prevention of the ankle pitting or edema elicited by nifedipine. A balance in arteriolar and venular dilatation promoted by captopril is the suggested mechanism for these effects. With the two-drug combination the function of the left ventricle was not reduced and possibly improved; blood urea nitrogen and serum electrolyte and creatinine concentration were not affected. Plasma renin activity increased with captopril and reverted toward baseline with the addition of nifedipine, suggesting an interference of the calcium-channel blocker with the release of renin.", 
    "12": "A number of studies have shown short-term hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in patients with congestive heart failure treated with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors. The long-term efficacy of the oral long-acting converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril remains to be established in controlled studies. We evaluated this drug in 36 patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to III heart failure who were clinically stable on digoxin and diuretic therapy. After baseline assessment of symptoms, exercise capacity, and results of echocardiographic examination and right heart catheterization, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 5 mg enalapril twice daily (n = 18) or placebo (n = 18) in a double-blind fashion. The two groups had similar clinical, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic characteristics before treatment. After 3 months of treatment, the enalapril group showed a significant improvement as judged by subjective patient impression, functional class, and exercise duration (9.3 +/- 5.7 vs 17.6 +/- 5.6 min; p less than .001). Diuretic dosage was reduced in six patients and increased in one patient, one patient had died and another had been withdrawn from the study. In the placebo group there was no significant change with respect to patient impression, functional class, or exercise duration; diuretic dosage was increased in seven patients and four patients had died. Echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions were significantly reduced and left ventricular shortening fraction significantly increased in the enalapril group but were unchanged in the placebo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "The renin-angiotensin system is an important regulator of vascular resistance in many patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. To quantitatively evaluate this contribution requires correlation of markers of the renin-angiotensin system with haemodynamic parameters, notably blood pressure, cardiac output, and calculated systemic vascular resistance. In addition, to determine ventricular loading properties, assessment of cardiac filling pressures is also required. The availability of specific pharmacological inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system greatly enhances such correlation, as the haemodynamic consequence of blocking the renin-angiotensin system can then more fully identify its contribution. In the last decade, highly specific pharmacological inhibitors have become available to serve such a purpose. Renin inhibitory peptides, and renin-specific antibodies can block the rate-limiting step of the renin-angiotensin cascade: namely, the cleavage of 4 amino acids from the angiotensinogen substrate by renin. However, this method of blockade is still at the early stages of investigation. More readily available are converting enzyme inhibitors which block the formation of angiotensin II, the potent vasoconstrictor which mediates increased systemic vascular resistance, and angiotensin II analogues which compete with endogenous angiotensin II for vascular and adrenal receptors. Although hypertension and chronic congestive heart failure are clinically distinct entities in many respects, their common bond is the fact that both pathological mechanisms are mediated by an increase of systemic vascular resistance. The implications of blocking the resulting vasoconstriction in both entities are therefore quite similar. This review summarises our present knowledge of the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the vasoconstriction of hypertension and congestive heart failure, and also summarises the haemodynamic consequences of such inhibition. The implications of the response to these specific pharmacological probes, as well as their limitations, are discussed. Their importance rests not only in their therapeutic application, but also in their contribution as probes for pathophysiological mechanisms of vasoconstriction in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "14": "The renal arteriogram alone, useful as an anatomic guide for the surgeon or radiologist, is inadequate to predict potential blood pressure reversal by correction of the obstructing lesion. A patient must be identified as having functionally significant renal arterial disease before intervention can be recommended. The authors discuss uncovering functionally significant renal artery stenosis, the pathophysiology of experimental Goldblatt hypertension, and criteria to identify renovascular hypertension, including peripheral plasma renin activity and differential renal-vein renin determinations.", 
    "15": "In the spinal cord Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 (YGGFMRF) is located in small interneurons of the dorsal and ventral horns. From these storage sites, YGGFMRF can be released by perfusing the subarachnoidal spaces of the spinal cord with artificial spinal fluid containing substance P. In vitro YGGFMRF can be hydrolyzed readily by a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. In order to ascertain whether this reaction is physiologically relevant, we measured the content of YGGFMRF and Met5-enkephalin (YGGFM) in subarachnoidal space perfusate in presence and in absence of captopril, bestatin and thiorphan using substance P to activate the release of opioid peptides. Without peptidase inhibitors, the efflux of YGGFMRF and YGGFM was hardly detectable. The addition of captopril to the perfusion medium increased the substance P (10(-7) M)-induced release of YGGFMRF markedly but it increased the efflux of YGGFM to a much smaller extent. When captopril and bestatin were added together the amount of YGGFMRF present in the perfusate was further increased slightly. In contrast, the YGGFM content in the same perfusate was increased greatly by bestatin and only slightly by thiorphan. To characterize the pharmacological profile of these peptidase inhibitors, we compared electroacupuncture antinociception with and without intrathecal injections of captopril and bestatin. This antinociception, as measured by tail-flick latency, was potentiated by the intrathecal injection of captopril and bestatin. These results taken together suggest that YGGFMRF released in the perfusate of the arachnoidal space by substance P is metabolized by both dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase.", 
    "16": "Hypertension in pregnancy has implications for both maternal and fetal welfare. Extrapolation from concepts of mechanisms operating in hypertension in general to pregnancy-related hypertension is not justified. In the latter, the major features are a hyper-adrenergic state, plasma volume reduction and an increased systemic resistance. A reduction in uteroplacental perfusion may result from or may activate the mechanisms that elevate blood pressure. Humoral factors (e.g. hormonal attenuation of vascular reactivity) and prostacyclin deficiency may be central to the disordered physiology. Treatment of hypertension in pregnancy should aim at avoiding the vascular damage due to blood pressure elevation but not cause a reduction in uteroplacental perfusion. Unlike earlier antihypertensive regimens using centrally acting sympatholytics, adrenergic neuron blockers or diuretics, regimens using beta-blockers or combinations of beta-blockers with alpha-blockers or vasodilating agents such as hydralazine permit effective blood pressure control, even in severe hypertension, and pregnancy can often proceed until term or until fetal maturity is secured. Adverse effects on the fetus (growth retardation, cardiorespiratory depression, hypoglycaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia) formerly attributed to beta-blockers are more likely related to poorly controlled hypertension. Specific benefits of maternal beta-adrenoceptor blockade are suggested by evidence for prevention of proteinuric deterioration and a decrease in the incidence and severity of respiratory distress in premature infants. Hypertension in pregnancy still presents a formidable therapeutic challenge and requires comprehensive management with close monitoring of fetal welfare. The presence or development of proteinuria in a hypertensive pregnant woman implies a major increase in risk to the fetus and warrants immediate admission to hospital for specialist management.", 
    "17": "The hormonal and hypotensive effects of a single oral 10 mg dose of enalapril (MK-421), were assessed by a double-blind randomized trial in 12 subjects with essential hypertension, during a 100 and 40 mmol/day sodium intake. Peak serum MK-421 appeared 1 h following oral dosage. The bioactive conversion product of MK-421 (the parent diacid MK-422) appeared later, was maximal 4 h following dosage, and was still detectable 24 and 32 h later. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was inhibited maximally at 4 h (by 57 +/- 4% of control activity) and had a similar time course to the serum MK-422 level. Plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone fell during ACE inhibition, but no change in bradykinin was detected. Reciprocal rises in plasma renin and angiotensin I occurred with a similar time course to ACE inhibition. Sodium depletion did not alter drug levels, basal serum ACE nor the time course of its inhibition. The initial blood pressure was however significantly lower when the subjects had been on the 40 mmol/day sodium diet. Blood pressure fell in all subjects and the fall was maximal 4-8 h following MK-421. There was a close correlation between plasma drug level, ACE inhibition and the hypotensive effect. These results suggest that regardless of the final mechanism for the antihypertensive action of MK-421 it is a consequence of its inhibition of ACE.", 
    "18": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are effective therapy in hypertension. They are particularly useful in severe drug resistant or accelerated hypertension, in renal hypertension and in hypertensive heart failure. Although their exact mode of action has not been determined it is a consequence of the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme. They offer distinct advantages over conventional drugs in the treatment of high blood pressure particularly as they have no central or autonomic side effects and as a consequence the patients feel well. There is no postural effect on blood pressure and patients retain their normal cardiovascular reflex mechanisms and sexual function. They are particularly useful when combined with diuretics or salt restriction as not only do they have additive hypotensive effects but angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors prevent the secondary hyperaldosteronism and hypokalemia associated with diuretic administration. Lastly, unlike many other forms of treatment for hypertension, renal blood flow and renal function tend to be maintained with converting enzyme inhibitors. Their overall role in the management of hypertension has yet to be determined, and the ultimate incidence of adverse effects after prolonged therapy is not yet known. They are however, an exciting new development in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "19": "The effects of two single doses of the new oral nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor CI-906 on blood pressure and hormone levels are described in eight subjects with essential hypertension. Starting at 0.625 mg, doses were separated by a placebo day and doubled in consecutive patients until the full effect (obtained with 5 and 10 mg) was reached, at which point the remaining patients received the same dosage. All doses, including the smallest, caused ACE suppression to less than 1 per cent of baseline lasting for least 12 hours and remaining below 30 per cent at 48 hours, accompanied by a rise in plasma renin activity (by 10.9 +/- 2.1 ng/ml/hr) and fall in aldosterone (by -12.6 +/- 2.5 ng/100 ml). However, a clinically significant, though partial and short-lived, effect on blood pressure was observed at 2.5 mg. The two highest doses produced similar effects in terms of magnitude of mean blood pressure lowering (by 26 +/- 5 and 25 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively) and duration (varying from 12 to over 24 hours) regardless of pretreatment renin levels. There was no orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, or other adverse reaction.", 
    "20": "In normal humans nearly half the renin in plasma and kidney is inactive. Human inactive renin can be activated by a variety of proteases and by exposure to low pH and is a putative biosynthetic precursor of renin, i.e., prorenin. Pulse-labeling studies in a human renin-secreting tumor suggest that renin is synthesized as a prepro- and proform, both of which are inactive. Using the cDNA probe to deduce the amino acid sequence of precursor renin from the nucleotide sequence of human kidney mRNA, the prosegment was estimated to be 46 amino acids long, similar to differences in molecular weight between active and inactive renin. In plasma of diabetic patients with nephropathy and the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, inactive renin levels are increased 3-5 times normal. The inability to activate renin in this syndrome strongly implies that conversion of inactive (pro-) renin to active renin may be physiologically relevant to active renin production. Furthermore, in normal humans profound stimulation of active renin can be accompanied by a reciprocal drop in circulating inactive renin levels. The beta-adrenergic system and prostaglandins are two major, but independent, mechanisms of stimulating renin release. Studies in our laboratory suggest that prostaglandins and the beta-adrenergic system may act at different sites in renin production: beta-stimulation may act at early steps in renin biosynthesis, while prostaglandins may act preferentially at later steps that possibly involve conversion of inactive to active renin. Proof of this hypothesis lies in purification of inactive renin to determine whether it is prorenin and in the use of the renin cDNA probe to study pre- vs. posttranslational events in renin processing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Although clinical reports have suggested that antihypertensive therapy can control blood pressure in patients with renovascular hypertension, adequate randomized studies comparing medical versus surgical management are lacking. It is well recognized that progressive deterioration in renal function can occur despite good blood pressure control. Recent experience suggests that higher-risk patients with atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension can benefit from an aggressive surgical approach, whereas newer medical therapies capable of specific inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system suggest greater potential benefits to other patients. Properly performed randomized trials comparing medical versus surgical therapy of renovascular hypertension are needed.", 
    "22": "Several important vasoactive substances are taken up and/or metabolized during a single transpulmonary passage. Such substances include 5-hydroxytryptamine, prostaglandins (PGs) of the E and F series, and peptide substrates (angiotensin I and bradykinin) for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). When these metabolic processes are altered, predictable changes in systemic hemodynamics can follow because of altered arterial concentrations of the vasoactive substances. For example, a single dose of captopril (2 mg/kg, i.v.) given to conscious rabbits caused prolonged depression in pulmonary ACE activity, an effect that coincided with a significant reduction in mean systemic arterial pressure. In another study, total cardiopulmonary bypass in anesthetized dogs was associated with a time-dependent increase in arterial levels of immunoreactive PGE. Coincident with this elevation in PGE was a significant decrease in total systemic vascular resistance. The decrease in resistance was inhibited by pretreatment with indomethacin or by maintaining lung perfusion during extracorporeal circulation (i.e., left heart bypass). Thus, in the intact animal, significant reduction in lung metabolism, induced by either pharmacological or other experimental means, may modify vasoregulation of peripheral circulation. Furthermore, measurement of these metabolic functions may provide biochemical information about the pulmonary microcirculation, which is both the locus of these activities and an early site of acute lung injury.", 
    "23": "Based on a specific binding of labelled inhibitor to the enzyme active centre, a new principle of enzyme assay, inhibitor binding assay (IBA), was developed and applied to measurement of rat serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Serum diluted 1:50 was incubated with 125I-labelled ACE inhibitor, 351A, at pH 7.0, 37 degrees C, for 2 h. Inhibitor bound to ACE was separated with coated charcoal and results were calculated from a standard curve. The advantages offered by the novel inhibitor binding assay include simplicity, specificity, absence of interference by other enzymes or immunological cross-reactions, and great sensitivity enabling measurement of ACE in concentrations less than 0.1 units/ml. This principle of enzyme assay will not only have potential new applications for research involving ACE but may also be extended to other enzymes.",

The inhibitors 2 exhibit striking alterations in their conformational and acid-base properties due to the aza substitution, as is clear from pKa data and the x-ray crystal structure of a model azapeptide. In spite of this, they bind tightly to the enzyme, with inhibitor potency comparable to that of captopril.", 
    "25": "We developed a novel assay method for the determination of captopril and enalapril serum concentrations. This method is based on a new principle of enzyme assay, inhibitor binding assay (IBA), recently introduced by us for the measurement of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The assay principle is based on binding of (125)I-labelled ACE inhibitor (351A, p-hydroxy-benzamidine derivative of N-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline) to ACE. A competitive IBA was established using captopril as a standard and human serum ACE as a binder. For the assay of captive captopril, 0.1 ml of venous blood was taken into 9.9 ml of ice-cold buffer. Following separation of cells, the supernatant was stored at -20\u00b0C until assayed. Tubes containing added serum ACE as a binder, labelled inhibitor, and unknown samples, were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Following separation of bound label the content of captopril was read from a standard curve. Results in healthy subjects showed peak blood concentrations ranging from 220 to 1300 ng/ml within 30-60 minutes after a single oral dose of 50 mg captopril, and virtual disappearence of active drug from the blood within 3 hours. About 50 % of the measurable active captopril was lost during storage of diluted plasma for one month at -20\u00b0C The assay method is simple and sensitve, and measures active drug only. The present new assay principle may prove convenient and feasible for the assay of captopril and other ACE inhibitors in biological fluids.", 
    "26": "We assessed the antihypertensive and hormonal effects of two new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. enalapril (MK-421) and lisinopril (MK-521) in 22 patients with renovascular hypertension. All patients had angiographically verified renal artery lesions, 3 had bilateral renal artery stenosis and one a stenosis in a single kidney, and the rest had unilateral renal artery stenosis. After placebo treatment for 3 days in hospital, increasing doses from 5 to 40 mg daily, of both ACE-inhibitors were given. Both drugs induced a significant fall in blood pressure (BP). Significant BP reductions were seen after 2 h with a maximum fall for the enalapril group at a dose of 40 mg 4 h after drug intake (mean supine BP decrease-31/24 mm Hg, standing-29/16 mmHg). The corresponding maximal BP reductions were for the lisinopril group at a dose of 40 mg o.d. at 6 h: mean supine BP fall-25/28 mmHg and standing-33/31 mm Hg. Both drugs significantly inhibited serum ACE to about 5 to 10% of initial values and with a duration for more than 24 h. Both drugs also caused a decrease in plasma All levels and also in plasma aldosterone concentrations. There were no toxic effects and no serious side effects. Careful monitoring of biochemical variables showed no significant changes. We conclude that both enalapril and lisinopril are effective and very Safe agents for the treatment of renovascular hypertension and with a long duration of action and with very good tolerance.", 
    "27": "The efficacy and tolerability of the new ACE-inhibitor enlalapril (MK 421) and the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker atenolol for the treatment of primary hypertension were compared in a double blind parallel study. 12 patients were randomized to each drug. The doses of enalapril were 20 and 40 mg o.d and of atenolol 50 and 100 mg o.d. for 4 weeks each, whereafter hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 or 50 mg o.d. was added if necessary to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) <90 mm Hg 24 hours after drug intake. Supine BP was reduced from 160\u00b17/111\u00b14 mm Hg to 153\u00b113/101\u00b19 mm Hg (p<0.05/p<0.005) with enalapril and from 163\u00b117/109\u00b16 mm Hg to 145\u00b111/95\u00b17 mm Hg (p<0.005/p<0.001) with atenolol. The addition of HCTZ caused a profound additive BP reduction to 132\u00b17/88\u00b16 mm Hg with enalapril and to 130\u00b110/88\u00b17 mm Hg with atenolol. There was no significant difference between the efficacy of enalapril and atenolol alone or combined with HTCZ. The reduction in mean arterial pressure with enalapril tended to correlate with pre-treatment stimulated plasma renin activity and 24 hours urinary kallikrein excretion. Both drugs tended to reduce serum and urinary aldosterone and kallikrein excretion to the same extent. There was one drop-out in each group, one due to impotence on the combination of enalapril and HCTZ and one due to peripheral coldness during atenolol treatment. Other side effects were mild. No toxic adverse effects were registered.", 
    "28": "In a 36-year-old woman with malignant hypertension and moderate renal insufficiency from nephrosclerosis normotension was not achieved by the combination of a beta-blocker, a vasodilator, and a loop-diuretic. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril was then added to the therapy. The blood pressure control was good. However, due to adverse reactions, captopril had to be withdrawn. Later on, the patient was successfully treated with enalapril, another ACE inhibitor, without the relapse of any adverse reactions.", 
    "29": "In three unilaterally nephrectomized patients with a poorly functioning remaining kidney, a reversible decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was observed during treatment with captopril. Only modest decreases in blood pressure ocurred. In four patients with various forms of malignant hypertension and impairment of renal function, GFR remained unchanged or even increased when the blood pressure was reduced by captopril. All patients had increased plasma concentrations of renin and angio-tension II prior to captopril. We hypothesize that an activation of the renin-angiotensin system in hypertensive patients with reduced GFR may either reflect a compensatory mechanism aiming at maintaining renal function, or imply an excessive angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction causing a decrease in renal function. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be damaging for renal function in the first situation and beneficial in the second.", 
    "30": "The effects of two angiotensin I convening enzyme inhibitors on the kallikrein-kinin system and prostanoids were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The doses of captopril were 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg\u00d7day given twice daily, and those of CI-906 20 and 40 mg/kg once daily. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing the systolic blood pressure. Captopril increased urine volume dose-dependently (up to 3-fold with the largest dose). Only the larger dose of CI-906 was slightly diuretic. Captopril decreased the 24-h urinary excretion of kallikrein, while the excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 was increased markedly and that of T \u00d7 B2 to a lesser extent. CI-906 had no effect on the 24-h urinary excretion of kallikrein, 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 and T \u00d7 B2. Both drugs tended to reduce PGE2 excretion. Captopril and CI-906 did not alter plasma kininogen levels. The marked renal effects of captopril may be caused by a strong local inhibition of converting enzyme in the kidneys. Captopril is mainly excreted unchanged in urine, and it is secreted actively by the proximal tubular cells. CI-906 is eliminated predominantly by biliary excretion. It is also possible that direct stimulation of prostacyclin formation by captopril may be involved in the diuretic action of the drug. However, as it was shown with CI-906, the increase in urine flow and the associated changes in urinary kallikrein and prostanoids are not necessary for the antihypertensive effect caused by the inhibition of converting enzyme.", 
    "31": "The acute hemodynamic and hormonal effects of the oral angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor MK-521 were assessed over a period of 96 hours in 6 patients with heart failure. This compound is the lysine analogue of enalapril diacid (MK-422) and is biologically active following absorption. Dosages ranging from 1.25 mg to 5.0 mg were administered on days 1 and 3, followed by 48 hours intensive hemodynamic observation. Marked reduction in mean arterial pressure (25.2%), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (47.3%), and systemic vascular resistance (34.5%) was observed. Arterial blood was sampled at frequent intervals for angiotensin 1 (AI), angiotensin II (All), plasma renin activity, renin substrate, plasma aldosterone, urinary aldosterone, ACE activity, and serum drug levels. Right atrial blood was sampled simultaneously for AI and All thus permitting reliable assessment of the degree of pulmonary conversion to angiotensin II. Prolonged inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was confirmed and corresponded to drug concentration. The results indicate hemodynamic efficacy and potent ACE inhibition over a period exceeding 24 hours.", 
    "32": "Captopril was administered to 23 patients in cardiac failure refractory to digitalo-diuretic therapy. Four patients had a large fall in systolic blood pressure (less than 70 mmHg) with a single dose of 25 mg of captopril. In the other 19 patients a significant fall in mean pulmonary capillary pressure (16,8 +/- 6,1 mmHg vs 27,2 +/- 8,5 mmHg, p less than 0,001), mean pulmonary artery pressure (26,3 +/- 11,3 mmHg vs 38,3 +/- 12,4 mmHg, p less than 0,001), mean right atrial pressure (5 +/- 5 mmHg vs 8 +/- 6 mmHg, p less than 0,01) was observed: there was a moderate fall in mean systemic arterial pressure (13%, p less than 0,001). There was a significant fall in pulmonary resistance (27%, p less than 0,001). The cardiac index increased (2,8 +/- 0,5 l/min/m2, p less than 0,001) and systemic resistance fell by 25% (p less than 0,001). The heart rate decreased by an average of 7 beats/min (p less than 0,02). The treatment was stopped in one patient because of the inefficacy of captopril at 100 mg per dose. The average daily dose in the 18 patients on long-term treatment was 212,5 +/- 106,8 mg. At the second month, the haemodynamic parameters were remeasured before the morning dose of captopril. The effects observed after the single dose were maintained apart from the systemic blood pressure, heart rate and systemic resistances which had returned to the value observed before administration of captopril. The mean pulmonary capillary pressure was significantly lower than before treatment but was higher than after the single dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "We describe neutrophil chemoattractant activity that is produced by cultured bovine aortic and pulmonary arterial endothelial cells when incubated with thiourea, a substance that causes increased permeability pulmonary edema in animals. The chemoattractant activity was present in culture supernates and cell lysates of endothelial cells incubated with thiourea but was not present in untreated cells. Production of chemoattractant activity was not associated with cell death; viable cell counts and cell homogenate angiotensin converting enzyme levels were not affected, and Cr release was only slightly elevated after incubation with thiourea. At least 1.5 h of incubation with 0.5 mM thiourea was necessary for generation of neutrophil chemoattractant activity. Culture supernates from pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and lung fibroblasts did not show increased neutrophil chemoattractant activity after incubation with thiourea. The chemoattractant had both chemokinetic and chemotactic properties, was heat stable, and was extractable into organic solvents. Meclofenamate, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, minimally inhibited chemoattractant production, whereas 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), an inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, completely abolished generation of chemoattractant activity, suggesting that the activity could be a product of arachidonic acid metabolism. These results demonstrate that endothelial cells can produce a substance(s) with neutrophil chemotactic activity. Production of neutrophil chemoattractant activity by endothelial cells could be important in polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation at injured vascular sites.", 
    "34": "The contact phase of blood coagulation in a group of patients suffering from essential hypertension was studied before and after captopril administration. The baseline levels of factor XII, factor XI and plasminogen were significantly higher than in normals and correlated with baseline diastolic blood pressure levels. On the contrary, plasma prekallikrein was not significantly different from normal. These results suggest the presence of a hypercoagulable state in essential hypertension. After captopril administration, factor XII, factor XI and prekallikrein rapidly decreased, perhaps as a consequence of the drug's effect on the vascular endothelial surface. There was no correlation between the changes of active and inactive renin and the changes of prekallikrein and plasminogen levels. Our data do not support the view that factor XII-plasma kallikrein or plasmin dependent pathways are involved in the activation of inactive renin in vivo. Captopril, by provoking rapid pressure changes, appears to be able to affect the clotting system.", 
    "35": "Quantitative histochemical measurements of aminopeptidase A (APA, angiotensinase A) were done kinetically in the kidney glomeruli of rats after short-term experiments (treatment with furosemide as well as captopril for 2, 4, and 6 h). The APA activities increased after treatment with furosemide or captopril. Highest activities were determined after 4 h using furosemide and 6 h using captopril. It is concluded that glomerular APA activities correspond to the renin/angiotensin plasma levels and that the fast changes of APA activities are well demonstrable by kinetic densitometric measurements in situ.", 
    "36": "Partly occluding the abdominal aorta between the renal arteries caused the rat to drink steadily increasing amounts of 2.7% NaCl when this solution and water were available. The increase in NaCl intake preceded the increase in water intake that also occurred after aortic occlusion, and intakes of both fluids were reaching maximal values 1-2 weeks after operation. The amounts of fluid drunk during the day increased greatly. This change in the pattern of drinking, together with the rise in fluid intake and the drop in food intake meant that drinking was less associated with feeding than it is in the normal rat. The rats went into fluid and electrolyte deficit within 24 h of partial aortic occlusion and remained in deficit for about a week (the duration of the balance experiment) despite increasing intakes of NaCl and water. Renal function was unimpaired during the first 2 weeks, and the abnormal signs were mainly and rapidly reversed by removal of the ischaemic kidney or administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Therefore polydipsia and increased sodium appetite in the first 2 weeks after aortic occlusion were likely to have been caused by fluid deficit, with increased renin secretion from the ischaemic kidney contributing to both behaviours. Arterial blood pressure rose immediately after aortic occlusion, before the onset of increased drinking. Up to 3 weeks after operation the incidence and severity of the hypertension did not appear to depend on the spontaneous changes in intake of water or hypertonic NaCl.", 
    "37": "Treatment with captopril in resistant normotensive congestive heart failure is associated with a pronounced reduction in blood pressure, particularly after the first dose. The effects of this reduction on renal function were assessed in 10 patients at the beginning of and during chronic treatment (at one week and three months). Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates were measured by isotope clearance during water diuresis. The first dose of captopril (25 mg) led to a pronounced fall in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates together with a decrease in mean arterial pressure; this fall correlated with baseline plasma renin activity. These changes were paralleled by decreases in water and sodium excretion. In contrast, by the end of the first week of treatment a similar fall in mean arterial pressure occurred together with a pronounced increase in renal plasma flow; the glomerular filtration rate was maintained and there was no decrease in water and sodium excretion. This new response pattern recurred after three months of treatment. The difference in response at different stages of treatment may reflect the balance between the different mechanisms influencing kidney dynamics in heart failure and their alteration by converting enzyme inhibition. The sustained increase in renal plasma flow during chronic treatment with captopril may account for the continued control of heart failure in these patients.", 
    "38": "Studies were conducted in freshwater turtles Pseudemys scripta to define some characteristics of the renin-angiotensin system in this reptile. Dialyzed acid-treated kidney extract (1 g tissue per ml water) produced a prolonged pressor response in unanesthetized turtles, which was eliminated by boiling the extract or by pretreating the turtle with [Sar1, Ile8]angiotensin II. A rat pressor assay was employed because turtle angiotensin (ANG) was bound poorly by the anti-[Asp1, Ile5, His9]ANG I used in our radioimmunoassay. Kidney extract incubated with homologous plasma (pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C) produced a time-dependent pressor response in rats. The pressor activity of the product was eliminated by dialysis or by pretreating the rats with [Sar1, Ile8]ANG II. The pressor response in anesthetized turtles to ANG I was significantly reduced by captopril, whereas the ANG II response remained unchanged, thus demonstrating the presence of ANG-converting enzyme activity in these animals. We determined the velocity of turtle ANG formation at various dilutions of enzyme (kidney extract) or substrate (plasma). Turtle kidney extract incubated with homologous plasma displayed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Finally we conducted experiments to determine whether a portion of turtle plasma renin exists in an inactive form. Trypsinization caused a slight increase in plasma renin activity (PRA), whereas acidification to pH 3.3 yielded a fourfold increase in PRA.", 
    "39": "This study examines the role of the renal nerves in the chronic and early developmental stages of one-kidney, one-clip (1K-1C) Goldblatt hypertension. Groups of uninephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats underwent renal artery constriction with a clip of an internal diameter of 0.23 mm (groups 1 and 3) or 0.40 mm (groups 2 and 4) to produce severe or moderate hypertension. Two weeks later, groups 1 and 2 were subjected to renal denervation and groups 3 and 4 were denervated 6 and 7 wk after clipping, respectively. In all four groups, hypertension remained unchanged during the subsequent 2 wk after denervation. To study further the effects of renal denervation during the early onset of hypertension, groups 5, 6, and 7 received the smaller (0.23 mm) clip after uninephrectomy. Groups 5 and 6 were renal denervated immediately before clipping; group 7 was not denervated. In groups 6 and 7 the renin-angiotensin system was blocked with a continuous infusion of the converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril for 24 h before and 15 days after clipping. In group 5, renal denervation did not prevent a prompt and severe rise in the systolic blood pressure. In groups 6 and 7, infusion of captopril prevented the hypertension only during the first 4 days after clipping; at no time was there a difference in the systolic blood pressure curves of groups 6 and 7 during or after captopril infusion. These data demonstrate that regardless of the severity and duration of hypertension, renal denervation failed to attenuate either the development or the maintenance of 1K-1C Goldblatt hypertension in the rat. Thus the present results fail to provide support for the concept that the renal nerves modulate the hypertension in this experimental model.", 
    "40": "The mechanism of decreased pressor responsiveness to pressor agents was examined serially throughout pregnancy in conscious rats. Rats, 15 and 20 days pregnant, showed marked blunting of the pressor response to graded doses of angiotensin, whereas after only 5 days of pregnancy there was a normal response and at 10 days an intermediate pressor response. A role for prior occupancy of vascular angiotensin II receptors for the blunted pressor response was made less likely by the observation that treatment with captopril to decrease endogenous angiotensin II did not improve the angiotensin II pressor response in 15-day pregnant rats. Studies of smooth muscle receptor binding of angiotensin II showed that, in pregnancy, receptor affinity and number was not changed. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with meclofenamate increased the pressor response to angiotensin II toward normal in pregnant animals. The blunted vascular response in pregnancy was not specific for angiotensin since pregnant animals showed a similar decrease in the response to both norepinephrine and arginine vasopressin. Furthermore, meclofenamate increased the pressor response to norepinephrine and vasopressin in pregnant rats. We conclude that pressor hyporesponsiveness in pregnancy is not specific for angiotensin II and is not caused by alterations in vascular receptor occupancy or binding. In pregnancy there is a decreased pressor response to all three major pressor agents that is improved by inhibition of prostaglandin production.", 
    "41": "Neutrophilic progenitor cells (CFU-NM) in mice with busulfan-induced latent bone marrow hypoplasia have been shown to be selectively suppressed by captopril in vivo. To study this further, marrow from mice given busulfan was used to test for myelotoxicity in vitro. It was found that myelotoxic agents, such as doxorubicin, cytarabine, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, and chloramphenicol have the same suppressive effect in vitro on CFU-NM obtained from normal marrow as obtained from marrow of mice given busulfan. Our results suggest that in vitro, the CFU-NMs from mice given busulfan are not excessively sensitive to the action of at least these myelotoxic agents. It was also found that neither captopril nor three known captopril metabolites suppress CFU-NM from mice given busulfan. This result suggests either that the myelotoxicity induced in vivo by captopril is not caused by the parent compound or any of the three metabolites tested, or more likely, that the suppressive action of captopril on CFU-NM in vivo is caused by the suppression of an earlier myeloid progenitor cell.", 
    "42": "We report the first comparative study on enalapril maleate, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension. Fifty-four patients were randomly assigned to treatment with enalapril or propranolol for 16 weeks following a placebo run-in-phase. The study was double-blind. Enalapril and propranolol both reduced blood pressure, though the changes were significantly treated with enalapril were normotensive at the end of the study. Enalapril treatment was associated with a significant reduction in weight. Both drugs raised plasma potassium and urea. No haematological abnormalities occurred with enalapril and there were no reports of rash, taste disturbance or proteinuria. At the end of the trial the mean daily dose of enalapril was 20 mg and that of propranolol was 180 mg.", 
    "43": "Thirty-nine patients were entered into a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel protocol to assess the safety and efficacy of enalapril (MK-421, 10 to 20 mg bid), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 25 to 50 mg bid), or combined drug therapy (MK-421 + HCTZ) for the treatment of primary hypertension. Specifically monitored were the effects of each drug program on BP and pulse, serum chemistries, body fluid composition and weight, renal function, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Results indicate that MK-421, HCTZ, and combined therapy were equally effective in lowering BP; none of the therapies significantly altered glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow. Patients on MK-421 experienced no change in volume, an increase in plasma potassium, no change in fractional sodium or potassium excretion, and a decreased urine osmolality associated with an enhanced free-water clearance. Plasma renin activity was increased, plasma angiotensin II was decreased, and plasma aldosterone was unchanged. In contrast, patients on HCTZ developed volume contraction, hypokalemia associated with an increase in fractional sodium and potassium excretion, and an increased urine osmolality associated with a decreased free-water clearance. Plasma renin activity was increased, however, plasma angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone were unchanged. Patients on combined therapy with MK-421 + HCTZ demonstrated qualitatively similar changes in serum chemistries, body fluid volumes, and renal function compared with patients receiving HCTZ alone, whereas changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in these patients were qualitatively similar, but more marked, compared with those occurring in patients receiving MK-421 alone. We conclude that MK-421 is an effective first-step antihypertensive agent that does not produce adverse metabolic, volume, or renal effects.", 
    "44": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the adaptation of late steps in aldosterone biosynthesis to sodium intake was studied in potassium-deficient rats. Capsular portions of adrenal glands were incubated with [3H]corticosterone and conversion to aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone was measured by double isotope dilution and multiple paper chromatography. Sodium loading of sodium- and potassium-depleted rats resulted in a rapid and extensive fall in PRA but only in a delayed and gradual suppression of aldosterone biosynthesis. Treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, did not affect aldosterone biosynthesis in rats with established sodium and potassium deficiency, but blocked the stimulation of the conversion of corticosterone to aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone by sodium restriction of potassium-depleted rats. Infusion of a high dose of angiotensin II into potassium-deficient rats stimulated aldosterone biosynthesis depending upon the concurrent sodium intake. Accordingly, the renin-angiotensin system plays an important but limited role in the control of late steps of aldosterone biosynthesis by sodium intake. Angiotensin II seems to be essential for the induction but not for the maintenance of a high activity of the enzyme(s) involved in the conversion of corticosterone to aldosterone during combined sodium and potassium restriction. The sensitivity of the zona glomerulosa to the long term stimulatory action of angiotensin II varies with the sodium intake and appears to be regulated by the plasma potassium concentration and unknown other mediators.", 
    "45": "An assay for a new orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, CGS 13945, and its active metabolite, CGS 13934, in plasma is described. The compounds are extracted from plasma at pH 3 into methylene chloride. The organic layer is evaporated and the reconstituted residue is chromatographed on a reversed-phase column, with ultraviolet detection. The ratios of peak height of both compounds to internal standard are linearly related to their respective concentrations over the concentration range 0.05 to 10 mg/L. As little as 50 ng of drug or metabolite can be measured in 1 mL of plasma. With use of an automated chromatographic system, samples can be analyzed overnight in a continuous unattended run.", 
    "46": "The renin-angiotensin system has been shown to participate in the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure in many patients. However, the immediate assessment of this contribution in individual patients may sometimes be difficult. As a pharmacologic estimate of angiotensin II receptor activity, we infused the angiotensin II analogue, saralasin, in 20 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The infusion resulted in blood pressure responses ranging from an agonist pressor response (increased systemic resistance) in patients with low intrinsic renin-angiotensin system activity, to an antagonist depressor response (decreased systemic resistance) in patients with marked activation of the renin-angiotensin system. The ability of the saralasin response to pharmacologically estimate angiotensin II receptor activity in CHF was further revealed by two physiologic maneuvers that decrease endogenous circulating angiotensin II and angiotensin II receptor occupancy. Both converting enzyme inhibition with captopril and sodium repletion, factors known to decrease endogenous angiotensin II activity, provoked agonist responses to saralasin infusion. Furthermore, saralasin was able to reverse the orthostatic hypotension precipitated by converting enzyme inhibition of angiotensin-dependent vascular tone. In summary, saralasin provided a means to estimate angiotensin receptor activity and may therefore serve as a probe of angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction in the pathophysiology of chronic CHF.", 
    "47": "The pharmacologic profile of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, is described. After reviewing the total clinical experience of captopril from the world literature and manufacturer's files, a small subgroup of clinically complex patients at particular risk of side effects and in whom the drug must be used with caution is characterized. Evidence is available that demonstrates that lower doses (150 mg/day or less, with modest doses of diluretic agents) are effective in both short- and long-term therapy, while the incidence of side effects is substantially reduced. With this background information, the benefit-risk ratio is substantially improved and the use of captopril as a primary agent in the management of hypertension may be considered.", 
    "48": "Changes in blood pressure and heart rate in response to the renin inhibitor H77 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were compared in conscious dogs during progressive sodium depletion. There were significant positive correlations between plasma renin activities immediately prior to administration of the inhibitors and the subsequent reductions in blood pressure produced by the inhibitors. The slopes and intercepts were similar for the two inhibitors, suggesting that both H77 and captopril were operating predominantly via inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Although the effects of H77 and captopril on heart rate and blood pressure were quantitatively similar, a small additional action of captopril was observed in dogs that had been sodium restricted for 12 days. Captopril injected during H77 infusion also had a small additional hypotensive action and caused a significant further increase in heart rate.", 
    "49": "After reversible causes have been excluded and precipitating factors eliminated therapy of chronic heart failure is performed to achieve the following goals: A reduction of cardiac work by physical restriction; the increased risk of thromboembolic complications should be met by special physical exercises, elastic stockings and a low-dose heparin therapy in hospitalized patients. To improve the contractility of the heart muscle by digitalis. The efficacy of digitalis has been demonstrated by a double-blind study. It cannot be excluded, however, that digitalis therapy may be associated with an increased mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and complex ventricular arrhythmias. To eliminate symptoms of congestion. To reduce pre- and afterload by vasodilators. The application of vasodilators has become an established therapy in patients who do not respond to conventional therapy with digitalis and diuretics. By activation of the adrenergic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system-an initially useful compensatory mechanism to sustain blood pressure and stroke volume-peripheral vascular resistance and end-diastolic volume increase in patients with chronic heart failure. Both factors contribute to an increase in afterload, thereby further diminishing left ventricular function. In this situation vasodilators are particularly effective. According to their main mode of action they alter venous capacity and/or systemic vascular resistance to a different degree. Knowledge of their effects is necessary for a successful application in individual patients.", 
    "50": "The potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, MK351A, was radioiodinated and found to show saturable, high affinity, reversible binding to membrane fractions of rat lung. At 20 degrees C the labelled inhibitor bound to lung membranes with a T1/2 of congruent to 2-3 min and reached a plateau at 15 min; the complex dissociated with a T1/2 congruent to 65 min on addition of excess unlabelled MK521. The potency of a series of converting enzyme inhibitors in displacing the radioactive ligand closely paralleled their anticatalytic potency, strongly suggesting that the ligand labels the active site of converting enzyme. This ligand has the desired properties as a probe for autoradiographic localization of converting enzyme since it exhibits high affinity, stable binding to the enzyme with very low non-specific binding (less than 2% of total). In vitro autoradiographic analysis using 125I-MK351A revealed a very high density of converting enzyme in lung, small bowel mucosa, adrenal zona glomerulosa and medulla and renal cortex. In rat forebrain a very high density of binding was found in the choroid plexus, subfornical organ and caudate-putamen. This technique provides a promising method for the quantitative localization of angiotensin converting enzyme in tissues.", 
    "51": "The acute and chronic effects of enalapril (MK421) were assessed in a double-blind randomized trial in subjects with essential hypertension. In acute studies, twelve subjects received enalapril (10 mg p.o.), following which there was a fall in blood pressure, maximal at 6 h and lasting for 24 h. Serum MK422 (enalaprilic acid, the bioactive form of enalapril) and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition had a similar time course with good correlation between drug levels and ACE inhibition (P less than 0.001, r = 0.98, n = 16) and between ACE inhibition and the hypotensive effect (P less than 0.001, r = 0.84, n = 16). In chronic studies enalapril was titrated from 5 mg to 20 mg twice a day in eleven hypertensive patients to achieve a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg. Treatment continued for 3-12 months. Increasing serum MK422 was correlated with reducing serum ACE activity (P less than 0.001, r = 0.8, n = 104). The fall in blood pressure correlated both with serum MK422 level (P less than 0.05, r = 0.37, n = 39) as well as ACE inhibition (P less than 0.01, r = 0.45, n = 42). The drug level:ACE inhibition curve was shifted to the right during chronic enalapril treatment. ID50 for serum ACE was 32 ng MK422/ml following the single 10 mg dose of MK421 and 70 ng MK422/ml during chronic treatment. Blood pressure falls during acute and chronic treatment were similar over the range of serum MK422 levels achieved. The shift in the drug level:ACE inhibition curve suggests induction of ACE during chronic treatment with enalapril in man.", 
    "52": "Systolic blood pressure responses to enalapril maleate (MK 421, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI] and hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ) were studied in conscious Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats maintained on a high salt (8.0% NaCl) and a normal salt (0.4% NaCl) diet. The DS rats were severely hypertensive after 3 weeks on the high salt diet whereas the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the DR rats were normotensive. Oral treatment with enalapril (15-100 mg X kg-1 X day-1) and HTZ (60-400 mg X kg-1 X day-1) caused a significant reduction of SBP in the DS rats with the high salt diet (P less than 0.001); however, this was not observed until after 4 weeks of treatment when the dosage was 30 and 150 mg X kg-1 X day-1, respectively. Furthermore, enalapril therapy alone significantly reduced the SBP of all groups of rats regardless of diet or Dahl strain (P less than 0.001), but this was not observed until the end of the 7th week of therapy in DR rats on 8.0% NaCl and the end of the 3rd week of therapy for DR and DS rats on 0.4% NaCl. These results suggest that enalapril may lower SBP by mechanisms other than those related to an action as a CEI.", 
    "53": "Enalapril, the ethyl ester of a potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, was administered to healthy volunteers as a capsule containing 10 mg of the maleate salt, every 24h for eight doses. Serum profiles show little accumulation of enalaprilat following eight daily doses of enalapril maleate. An average effective half-life for accumulation of approximately 11h was calculated from urine data. Comparison of observed 24-h urinary recoveries of enalaprilat to predicted steady-state recovery indicates that an 'average' steady state for enalaprilat is attained by the third or fourth dose of enalapril maleate. Statistical comparison of daily urinary recoveries, as well as Cmin values for enalaprilat, confirm this. Observed fluctuations in serum and urine data during apparent steady state suggest some day-to-day variability in the absorption of enalapril maleate and/or its hydrolysis to enalaprilat. An accumulation ratio of 1.3 for enalaprilat was calculated from the predicted steady-state urinary recovery and observed urinary recovery for dose one.", 
    "54": "Factors modulating the fetal aldosterone response to hypoxemia were studied in three groups of chronically catheterized fetal lambs between 131 and 143 days of gestation (term, 145 days). One group (control group) received an infusion of 5% dextrose in water; the second group (captopril-treated group) was given captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme; the third group (captopril plus dexamethasone-treated group) received dexamethasone in addition to captopril. In all groups of fetuses, hypoxemia was associated with a significant increase in plasma K+ concentration (+0.7 +/- 0.1 meq/liter). In control fetuses, changes in plasma aldosterone concentration during hypoxemia correlated closely with changes in plasma K+ concentration r = 0.79; P less than 0.001) and with changes in plasma angiotensin II concentration (r = 0.77; P less than 0.001). In the captopril-treated fetuses, the rise in plasma aldosterone concentration during hypoxemia correlated closely with plasma K+ (r = 0.79; P less than 0.001) but not with plasma angiotensin II values (r = 0.17). No significant correlation was found between percent changes in maternal aldosterone and percent changes in fetal aldosterone during hypoxemia and following recovery (r = 0.36; P greater than 0.1) in captopril-treated fetuses. Administration of dexamethasone to fetuses receiving captopril completely inhibited the rise in plasma aldosterone associated with hypoxemia. Taken together, the present results suggest that the rise in plasma aldosterone during hypoxemia is not related to the level of activity of the renin-angiotensin system but depends probably on the increased secretion of adrenocorticotrophin by the fetus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "In eight hypertensive patients, forearm vascular tone was assessed by water plethysmography following inhibition of angiotensin II-converting-enzyme (ACE) activity with captopril. Acute captopril administration increased venous distensibility (VV30) and decreased forearm vascular resistance (FVR), while it lowered systemic blood pressure (BP). Alpha-one adrenergic receptor blockade by prazosin did not prevent captopril from decreasing vascular tone or lowering blood pressure (BP). Thus, captopril dilated both veins and arterioles. The primary mechanism of captopril's acute antihypertensive action did not involve inhibition of alpha1-adrenergic receptor activity. Moreover, captopril and prazosin together produced a greater reduction in BP and peripheral resistance than occurred with either agent alone.", 
    "56": "Two distinct systems of classifying vasodilator drugs have been developed over the past decade in an attempt to guide the choice of a therapeutic agent for the patient with severe heart failure, but the merits and utility of these systems have not been critically evaluated. Vasodilator drugs may be categorized according to their peripheral site of action: an agent may exert its effects preferentially on systemic arteries, systemic veins, or on both circulations. However, changes in the peripheral circulation cannot be directly translated into an improvement in central hemodynamic variables; furthermore, immediate hemodynamic responses may not be predictive of long-term clinical efficacy. Hence, there is no evidence that characterization of patients into hemodynamic subsets determined by the findings of right heart catheterization improves the clinical outcome of vasodilator therapy in chronic heart failure. An alternative classification system groups vasodilator drugs according to their mechanism of action: an agent may possess direct vasodilating effects or may exert its actions via selective neurohumoral inhibition. However, attempts to identify patients who might be most responsive to neurohumoral antagonism by measuring plasma renin activity or circulating levels of catecholamines before treatment have not been successful in predicting the clinical responses to therapy. Because neither system of drug classification provides the clinician with useful therapeutic guidelines, patients with severe heart failure appear to be best managed using a pragmatic approach in which specific drugs that produce predictable therapeutic benefits with a low frequency of side effects are utilized preferentially. Among presently available vasodilator agents, only captopril and oral isosorbide dinitrate have been shown to produce consistent hemodynamic and clinical improvement with an acceptable degree of adverse reactions.", 
    "57": "Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, is prescribed for hypertension. Its molecular structure shares features with D-penicillamine, in that both agents contain a thiol group. In addition, captopril has immunosuppressant activity. Captopril was therefore considered a potential slow-acting drug for treating rheumatoid arthritis. In an open study 15 patients with active arthritis were treated with captopril and followed for 48 weeks. Two-thirds of the patients reported improved arthritis symptoms, and significant changes were seen in several clinical and biochemical measurements, notably Ritchie articular index, clinical score, plasma viscosity, and C-reactive protein. Side-effects were generally mild and included transient taste loss, rashes, and hypotension. Only 2 patients withdrew as a result of drug intolerance.", 
    "58": "Dietary sodium intake alters pressor responsiveness to angiotensin II (AII) as well as altering prostaglandin production. As a result, the effect of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition on the pressor responsiveness to AII was evaluated. Prostaglandin synthesis inhibition with meclofenamate (5 mg/kg) or indomethacin (5 mg/kg) significantly enhanced the pressor response for AII at infusion rates of 0.10, 0.30 and 1.0 microgram/kg per min (P less than 0.05) in rats previously on a low sodium intake but had no effect in rats previously on a high sodium intake. In low sodium intake rats, pretreatment with captopril (1 mg/kg) prevented the enhancing effect of indomethacin on angiotensin II pressor responsiveness. The pressor response for norepinephrine was unaltered by sodium intake or prostaglandin inhibition. These results suggest that prostaglandin synthetase inhibition may enhance the pressor response for angiotensin II in situations where endogenous angiotensin II levels are elevated (i.e. low sodium intake). In situations where angiotensin II levels are suppressed (i.e. captopril pretreatment or high salt intake), prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors have no effect on the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin II.", 
    "59": "Angiotensins I, II, and III, renin substrate, and des-Asp1-angiotensin I were injected as a bolus into either the maternal or fetal circulation of human placental cotyledons perfused in vitro. All drugs tested produced dose-related increments in fetal perfusion pressure when injected into the fetal circulation, with the order of potency being angiotensin I approximately equal to angiotensin II approximately equal to angiotensin III greater than or equal to des-Asp1-angiotensin I greater than or equal to renin substrate. The responses to all the drugs could be blocked by the competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II, (Sar1, Ala8)-angiotensin II, but only the actions of angiotensin I, renin substrate, and des-Asp1-angiotensin I could be blocked by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. When the agents were injected into the maternal circulation, only angiotensins II and III caused dose-related increments in fetal perfusion pressure. Possibly, the placenta may be the main site of conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the fetoplacental unit, and angiotensin II produced by the placenta could act locally to control fetoplacental blood flow.", 
    "60": "The favourable haemodynamic effects of vasodilator drugs in refractory cardiac failure sometimes alter rapidly after the initial dose. This tachyphylactic phenomenon was looked for during captopril therapy in 14 patients with chronic cardiac failure resistant to digitalo-diuretic therapy and conventional vasodilator drugs. The average age of the patients was 64,4 +/- 3,8 years. Eleven patients had signs of congestive cardiac failure while the remaining three patients had only left ventricular failure. Four patients were classified as Stage III and the other ten Stage IV of the NYHA classification. Right heart catheter studies were performed with a Swan Ganz catheter and systemic pressures were measured by femoral artery catheterisation. Right and left pressures and cardiac output were measured under basal conditions, and 1 and 5 hours after a single dose of captopril (early and late periods). Captopril was given in between meals in 3 to 6 daily doses; in 10 of the 14 cases the dose was 50 mg 6 hourly. The haemodynamic parameters were recorded again during the early and late periods after the dose of captopril 24 and 48 hours after starting therapy. Captopril is a mixed vasodilator and is effective from the first hour of administration. It preferentially lowered pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) from 29,6 +/- 0,92 mmHg to 21,4 +/- 1,04 mmHg (delta PCP: -27,7%, p less than 0,01). Mean systemic blood pressure (MBP) fell less from 92,4 +/- 3,51 mmHg to 76,6 +/- 3,4 mmHg (delta MBP: -17%, p less than 0,01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Captopril kinetics were determined after a 100-mg oral dose of 14C-captopril in 21 patients with various degrees of renal impairment. Elimination kinetics of captopril were evaluated by model-independent methods. The body clearance (ClB) of captopril decreased steadily with decreasing creatinine clearance (ClCr) from 5.2 ml/min/kg for mild renal failure patients to 1.6 ml/min/kg for hemodialysis patients during an interdialytic period. In patients with mild renal impairment, renal and nonrenal clearances of captopril averaged 2.2 and 3.0 ml/min/kg, respectively, and fell (P less than 0.001) to 0.2 and 1.5 ml/min/kg in patients with severe renal impairment. There were no significant differences in the extent of total cumulative excretion (fecal plus urinary) of radioactivity over a 96- to 120-hr period between the patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment. The 48-hr renal excretion of captopril averaged 29, 21, and 8% of the dose in the mild, moderate, and severe renally impaired groups. In five additional hemodialysis patients, the mean dialyzer clearance of captopril averaged 120 ml/min. Approximately 35% of the dose was recovered in the 4-hr dialysate. Based on the above findings, a reduction in the dose of captopril is necessary in patients with renal failure.", 
    "62": "This study was designed to investigate the role of intrarenally formed angiotensin II (ANG II) in controlling glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during reduction of renal artery pressure (RAP). The experimental design prevented renin released by the kidney from entering the systemic circulation and therefore prevented changes in circulating ANG II from influencing GFR control. In dogs with only a functional intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS), GFR and renal blood flow (RBF) were not significantly altered by RAP reduction to 70 mmHg. After blockade of intrarenal ANG II formation with SQ 14225, reduction of RAP to 70 mmHg decreased GFR and filtration fraction to 75.6 +/- 7.0 and 59.0 +/- 4.1% of control, respectively, while RBF remained at 129.3 +/- 8.8% of control. Calculated efferent arteriolar resistance decreased considerably more when RAP was reduced after SQ 14225, whereas preglomerular resistance decreased to about the same level as observed prior to SQ 14225 infusion. After return of endogenously produced ANG II by recirculation of the renal venous blood or after infusion of ANG II (following SQ 14225) at a rate that restored RBF to the control level (with RAP held at 70 mmHg in each case), GFR, filtration fraction, and calculated efferent resistance were restored to control levels, but preglomerular resistance did not change. These results suggest that intrarenal ANG II formation plays an important role in maintaining GFR during reductions in RAP by constricting efferent arterioles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Twenty patients with primary or secondary Raynaud's phenomenon were, after a 4-week treatment-free interval, given captopril ( Lopirin ) at a dosage of 25 mg three times daily for 84 days. Marked subjective improvement was reported by 14 patients. Digital-artery pressure, blood flow at rest and blood flow during reactive hyperaemia increased. Blood flow at rest increased significantly after cooling (10 degrees C for three minutes).", 
    "64": "To assess the effect of furosemide and captopril on renal function and hyponatremia in patients with severe heart failure, we studied two groups of patients with hyponatremia who were receiving digoxin therapy and whose sodium intake was 40 meq/d. One group received captopril and furosemide, the second received captopril. The first group responded to combination therapy with a brisk natriuresis and diuresis, weight reduction, and an increase in serum sodium concentration. Patients who received captopril alone did not respond, despite a similar increase in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. When furosemide was then administered to patients who had received captopril alone, a brisk natriuresis, weight loss, and correction of hyponatremia followed. Treatment with furosemide is necessary to promote natriuresis and correction of hyponatremia in patients with severe heart failure treated with captopril; the renal vascular action of captopril enhances the effectiveness of furosemide.", 
    "65": "The role of hemodynamic monitoring during the initiation of vasodilator therapy for heart failure remains to be defined, despite the tremendous potential socioeconomic and clinical ramifications. We therefore performed resting and exercise hemodynamic studies before and during the initial 48 hr of captopril therapy in 14 stable patients with New York Heart Association Class II or III chronic congestive heart failure. Their clinical response to therapy was determined by evaluating changes in clinical status and the measured changes in exercise tolerance, heart size, and ejection fraction after 3 months. Significant improvement in each of these indexes was found for the group as a whole, but the baseline hemodynamics and the hemodynamic responses to captopril differed little between the patients showing marked improvement and those exhibiting little or no change. Correlations between the hemodynamic measurements and the changes in clinical class, exercise tolerance, heart size, and ejection fraction were generally poor. Even when they achieved significance, these correlations were too loose to allow prediction of the clinical efficacy of captopril in individual subjects. These findings indicate that the routine use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring during the initiation of captopril is unnecessary and potentially misleading, although such measurements remain valuable for diagnosis, the management of patients with complex conditions, and for investigation. The response to captopril may be best evaluated by serial measurements of exercise tolerance and heart size in addition to clinical assessment.", 
    "66": "The fall in blood pressure produced by captopril is not accompanied by a compensatory tachycardia. Angiotensin converting enzyme may participate in the metabolism of endogenous opioids and these substances can lower blood pressure without reflex tachycardia. It is therefore possible that the hypotensive effect of captopril involves an action on endogenous opioid metabolism. The influence of naloxone, an opiate receptor antagonist, on the cardiovascular effects of captopril has been studied in nine normal volunteers. Mean blood pressure following a 70 degrees head up tilt 1.5 h after captopril was significantly lower than following placebo, but the blood pressure following the combination of captopril and naloxone differed from neither the placebo nor the captopril values. Blood pressures (mm Hg) were: placebo 97.7 +/- 5.9; captopril 83.3 +/- 14.2; captopril + naloxone 89.6 +/- 11.8. Heart rate (beats/min) following a 70 degrees head up tilt at 1.5 h was the same on all three treatments: placebo 83.4 +/- 21.1; captopril 83.3 +/- 16.5; captopril + naloxone 83.6 +/- 11.8. Maximum systolic blood pressure achieved during isometric exercise following captopril + naloxone was intermediate between, and did not differ significantly from, pressures obtained on the other two treatment days. We conclude that co-administration of naloxone may attenuate the effect of captopril on blood pressure and that endogenous opioids could be involved in the actions of this drug.", 
    "67": "Syntheses of the potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor 1-(carboxymethyl)-3-(mercaptomethyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1- benzazep in -2-one (4a) and the corresponding eight-membered ring analogue (4b) are described. The influence of ring size on the inhibitory potencies of these substances is discussed.", 
    "68": "We measured both pulmonary and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in conscious rabbits before and for 6 days after administration of captopril (2 mg/kg i.v.). Pulmonary ACE activity was measured by means of modified indicator-dilution techniques after bolus injection of [3H]benzoyl-phenyl-alanyl-alanyl-proline ( BPAP , synthetic substrate for ACE). Plasma ACE activity was also determined radiometrically with [3H] BPAP as substrate. In addition, we measured the systemic pressor response to i.v. bolus dose of angiotensin I both before and after captopril. Twenty-four hours after captopril, pulmonary metabolism of BPAP had decreased from control of 73 +/- 5 to 8 +/- 2%; even 6 days after drug treatment there was still evidence of inhibition. In contrast, plasma ACE activity was significantly (P less than .05) reduced within 15 min of treatment (to 20% of control levels) but recovered within 24 hr. The time course of changes in the pressor response to angiotensin I, after captopril, resembled that of plasma ACE activity. Mean systemic arterial blood pressure was 81 +/- 4 torr at control and reached its nadir at 24 hr (64 +/- 2 torr; P less than .05); thereafter a gradual recovery ensued, similar in time course to that of pulmonary ACE. These data suggest that inhibition of plasma ACE and also the pressor response to angiotensin I are unrelated temporally to the hypotensive effects of captopril.", 
    "69": "To determine if macrophages express receptors for peptide antigens, guinea pig peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were examined for their uptake of the octapeptide angiotensin II (AII). PEC were incubated with [3H]AII, with or without nonradioactive AII as a cold inhibitor, for varying lengths of time before harvesting to determine the cell-associated [3H]AII counts per minute. The PEC-associated [3H]AII increased from 90 to 120 min of incubation, then plateaued on additional incubation to 3.5 hr. Inclusion of nonradiolabeled AII into the culture decreased the cell-associated [3H]AII by 80 to 90% at all time points. The uptake of [3H]AII was temperature-sensitive, with maximum cell-associated [3H]-AII occurring at 37 degrees C and reduced uptake occurring at 4 degrees C. The association of [3H]AII with PEC was specific and saturable, and the inhibitory dose for reducing the cell-associated [3H]AII by 50% with nonradiolabeled AII was around 6 X 10(-6) M. Various AII analogs were also employed as inhibitors to determine the fine specificity of [3H]AII binding, and only those analogs with nonaromatic amino acid substitutions for the carboxyl terminal Phe8 showed reduced inhibitory activity, indicating that Phe8 is important for binding. Scatchard analysis of binding indicated that two classes of receptors interacted with AII: a low number of receptors with Ka approximately equal to 3.5 X 10(8) M-1, and a large number of relatively low affinity of binding showing a Ka approximately equal to 5 X 10(5) M-1. The cellular binding activity was associated with isolated PEC plasma membranes, and after density gradient fractionation of solubilized membranes, AII binding activity was primarily associated with molecules of m.w. of around 50,000. PEC were separated into macrophages and lymphocytes by adherence, and all of the [3H]AII binding activity was associated with the macrophage-enriched cells. These results show that macrophages express specific receptors for AII and related peptides that are responsible for most of the uptake of AII by macrophages. We discuss the relevance of this receptor for the immunologically important uptake of AII by macrophages, and a potential physiologic role in angiotensin-converting enzyme production.", 
    "70": "Platelets were prepared from peripheral venous blood on iso-osmotic density gradients of Percoll, resulting in a good recovery of cells (50-80%) which were relatively free of contaminating blood cells (erythrocyte less than 0.1%, leucocyte less than 1%). At 22 degrees C, specific binding of 125I-labelled angiotensin II (300 pmol/l) was time and temperature dependent, saturable, reversible and linear with cell concentration. Scatchard analysis of saturation curves revealed a single class of binding sites with Kd 1.5 +/- 0.4 X 10(-10) mol/l and total binding capacity 6.3 +/- 1.2 receptors/platelet. Similar values (Kd 2.4 +/- 0.7 X 10(-10) mol/l and binding capacity 6.5 +/- 1.0 receptors/cell) were obtained by displacement analysis. From kinetic studies the forward and reverse rate constants were 3.1 X 10(8) mol min-1 l-1 and 3.6 X 10(-2)/min giving a Kd of 1.2 X 10(-10) mol/l. The relative binding potencies for angiotensin II and analogues were: [Sar1, Thr8]ANG II greater than ANG II greater than ANG III greater than [Sar1, Ala8]ANG II greater than ANG I. Incubation with an extracellular marker (51Cr-labelled EDTA) demonstrated that binding of angiotensin II to platelets was not due to free fluid endocytosis.", 
    "71": "To determine the effects of vasodilator and inotropic therapy on hyponatremia in patients with severe heart failure, we measured serum sodium concentration before and after treatment with captopril (70 patients), hydralazine (42 patients), prazosin (22 patients), and amrinone (19 patients), while diuretic dosages were kept constant. Serum sodium concentration increased only in hyponatremic patients treated with captopril (131.2 +/- 0.5 to 135.9 +/- 0. 5 SE ; p less than 0.001), but not during therapy with the other agents and not in patients with normal serum sodium concentration before treatment. Serum sodium began to rise 48 hours after the initiation of captopril therapy and reached its peak after 14 to 16 days. Correction of hyponatremia was related to functional interference with the renin-angiotensin system, but not to changes in renal function, serum potassium concentration, body weight, or the magnitude of hemodynamic or clinical improvement. These findings support experimental evidence that the renin-angiotensin system is important in the pathogenesis of hyponatremia in patients with severe heart failure treated with diuretics.", 
    "72": "Hemodynamic responses to vasodilators are commonly assessed when starting long-term vasodilator treatment in patients with chronic left ventricular failure, although the relation between short- and long-term responses is not established. Thus, short- and long-term hemodynamic responses to placebo and vasodilators (isosorbide dinitrate, minoxidil and enalapril or captopril) were measured and long-term clinical efficacy was assessed by changes in exercise capacity after 1 to 5 months of vasodilator administration (plus digitalis and diuretic agents) in 46 patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to IV heart failure caused by cardiomyopathy. There were no significant changes in hemodynamics or exercise capacity during placebo treatment. After initial doses and during long-term administration of vasodilator drugs, hemodynamics were significantly improved. After long-term vasodilator treatment, maximal oxygen uptake during exercise increased by 2.9 +/- 5.7 ml/min per kg from a control value of 14.1 +/- 5.6 ml/min per kg (p less than 0.01), and exercise duration also increased by 1.8 +/- 3.5 minutes (p less than 0.01). Changes in maximal oxygen uptake, however, did not correlate with short-term changes in pulmonary wedge pressure (correlation coefficient [r] = -0.14), cardiac index (r = -0.01) or systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.20). Long-term hemodynamic changes also failed to correlate with changes in exercise capacity. Baseline hemodynamics, cardiac dimensions and left ventricular ejection fraction before vasodilator administration all failed to correlate with baseline exercise capacity or with long-term changes in exercise capacity. Thus, hemodynamic measurements at initiation or during follow-up of vasodilator therapy do not relate to long-term clinical efficacy assessed by exercise capacity in patients with chronic left ventricular failure. Therefore, the rationale for making invasive hemodynamic measurements before initiating long-term vasodilator therapy for heart failure is questioned.", 
    "73": "We examined the in vitro effect of captopril (2.5 to 5 micrograms/ml) on the primary antibody response of human B cells. Captopril suppresses (by 50%) the specific anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) response of unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) but not that of nonadherent PBM. The susceptibility to captopril suppression can be restored in the latter cell cultures by 10% adherent radioresistant cells. This suppression is independent of prostaglandins. In transfer experiments, cells preincubated with 5 micrograms/ml captopril suppress the antibody response of autologous nonadherent PBM. The inductive phase of this suppression requires both adherent cells and radiosensitive T cells. Once induced, the suppression can be transferred by isolated T effector cells. In vivo after a unique oral intake of captopril a moderate suppressor activity can be demonstrated in adherent cells from normal individuals. We conclude that captopril interferes with the immune regulation by inducing a suppressor circuit involving monocytes and a T8 suppressor effector lymphocyte.", 
    "74": "Experiments were carried out in anaesthetized rats to compare the abilities of angiotensin II (A II) and angiotensin III (A III) to reverse the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (Teprotide) on salt and water excretion. In rats infused with Teprotide, significant increases in urine flow and sodium excretion were observed and arterial blood pressure decreased. Addition of A II (10 pmol min-1) to the Teprotide infusion reduced renal excretion of sodium and water to control values and excretion of potassium to below control. Blood pressure increased to a value significantly higher than that during the control period. In a separate group of rats the natriuretic and diuretic effects of Teprotide were reversed by a similar dose of A III (10 pmol min-1). A primarily angiotensin-mediated action is indicated for the renal effects of Teprotide. Although angiotensins II and III appeared to be equipotent in their abilities to reverse the renal responses to Teprotide, A II caused an increase in arterial blood pressure that was not seen with A III. In a third group of rats A II (10 pmol min-1) was added to the Teprotide infusion and an aortic snare located between the renal arteries was tightened to prevent any increase in left renal perfusion pressure. During this period the rate of sodium excretion from the left kidney was significantly lower than from the right kidney. It is concluded that in the absence of any accompanying 'pressure natriuresis' A II is more potent than A III in its ability to reverse the natriuretic action of Teprotide. The elevation of blood pressure to above control values by a dose of A II only just sufficient to reverse the Teprotide-induced natriuresis suggests that the concentration of angiotensin in the kidney is higher than in plasma and supports the concept of an intrarenal renin-angiotensin system. In the rat both A II and A III may affect renal salt and water excretion by a combination of mechanisms involving glomerular, vascular and tubular receptors. The possibility is raised that differential effects of the active angiotensins on these mechanisms may participate in the regulation of sodium excretion.", 
    "75": "Twelve patients with severe hypertension of different causes, resistant to conventional antihypertensive agents and also to maximum doses of either minoxidil or captopril added to other combinations, were effectively controlled with the association of small doses of minoxidil and captopril plus a diuretic and a beta-blocker. The untoward effects which were previously present in all the patients with maximum doses of minoxidil and in one of the patients treated with captopril disappeared or greatly diminished shortly after this association was started. The different mechanisms of action and opposite side effects of minoxidil and captopril provide the rationale for a combined treatment with the two drugs.", 
    "76": "Immediately after clipping, plasma renin and angiotensin II concentrations are raised in the two-kidney, one clip rat. Plasma renin and angiotensin II fall to relatively low levels between two and five weeks after operation, while blood pressure continues to rise. An experiment was carried out to determine whether complete suppression of angiotensin II during this two- to five-week period would have any effect on the development of hypertension. Captopril infused chronically (2 mg/kg/h) for up to 20 days completely prevented the rise in mean blood pressure [110.8 +/- 17.9 at day 0 compared to 88.3 +/- 8.4 (s.d.) mmHg at day 20] seen in an equivalent control group infused with dextrose (109.2 +/- 11.6 at day 0 compared to 131.7 +/- 23.6 mmHg at day 20). Preinfusion values for plasma renin and angiotensin II concentration were within the upper half of the range found for sham-operated normal rats. These findings would suggest that while the plasma levels of angiotensin II are low in relation to those seen immediately after clipping, they are still raised in comparison with normal sham-operated rats; this may contribute to the development of hypertension by a slow chronic, rather than an acute, effect.", 
    "77": "An inhibitor of angiotensin I (ANG I) converting enzyme, SA446, reduced the response to ANG I of blood vessels isolated from dogs and monkeys, but did not abolish the response even at high concentrations. The residual action of ANG I in the presence of high concentrations of SA446 could be abolished by (Sar1, Ala8)-ANG II. Vascular strips and crude extracts of vessels and lungs possessed the enzymic activity generating ANG II from ANG I, or hippuric acid from hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL). The HHL-hydrolysing activity of the crude extracts was completely inhibited by SA446 (10(-7) mol/l) and/or Na2-EDTA (10(-3) mol/l). However, the octapeptide generation was not abolished despite the combined treatment with SA446 (5 X 10(-4) mol/l) and Na2-EDTA (5 x 10(-3) mol/l). The residual activity forming ANG II was inhibited by chymostatin and soybean trypsin inhibitor, which however did not affect the HHL-hydrolysis. Combined treatment with SA446 (10(-5) mol/l) and chymostatin (2.5 X 10(-5) mol/l) abolished the vascular action of ANG I but did not alter the action of ANG II. These results strongly suggest that besides the ANG I converting enzyme, another enzyme which generates ANG II is present in vascular tissues and lungs, and may play an important role in the local generation of ANG II, which possibly regulates the regional vascular tone.", 
    "78": "The precise contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the genesis of essential hypertension is difficult to discern from clinical studies with converting enzyme inhibitors because of their multiple pharmacological effects. Specific inhibitors of renin, appropriate for clinical investigation, would help to resolve this question. Four classes of compounds have been demonstrated to be renin inhibitors of high potency: specific antibodies, general peptide inhibitors of acid proteases, analogues of angiotensinogens, and peptides related to the amino-terminal sequence of prorenin. Of these, it is likely that angiotensinogen analogues will be the first to be applied in human studies. The minimal substrate for renin has the sequence: His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr. Variants of this sequence have yielded competitive inhibitors. Recently, remarkably active compounds have been synthesized by reducing the peptide bond cleaved by renin or by incorporating the amino acid statine, found in pepstatin. These compounds have now been shown to be effective in dogs, rats and monkeys, and, according to recent preliminary studies, in man.", 
    "79": "Roles of kininogens in the development of potentiation of carrageenan edema in rats by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, = kininase II) inhibitor were studied. Carrageenan-induced edema was potentiated by oral administration of YS980, an ACE inhibitor, at a dose of 1 mg/kg 0.5 h before carrageenan injection. Intravenous injection of bromelain, a kininogen (KGN) depletor, at 3 mg/kg produced reduction of plasma KGN (total and high molecular weight KGN), which resulted in suppression of carrageenan edema and suppression of edema potentiation induced by YS980. Even after the plasma KGN level and inflammatory response to carrageenan returned to normal 24 h after the administration of bromelain, the potentiative effect of YS980 on the carrageenan edema remained suppressed. Thus, some factor other than plasma KGN is thought to be involved in the potentiation mechanisms on the carrageenan edema by YS980. Partially purified KGN from rat plasma (0.1 mg/site: liberated 4.4 X 10(-8) g bradykinin eq by trypsin digestion) completely restored the suppressed potentiation to normal by local preinjection to the inflamed site. In addition, such restoration was not observed in the animal in which plasma KGN was reduced 3 h after administration of bromelain. These results suggest that KGN, not only in plasma but also in tissue, play an active role in the development of potentiation of carrageenan edema by ACE inhibitor.", 
    "80": "Plasma angiotensin I-converting enzyme \"activity\" (CEA) was estimated as its enzymatic effect on the synthetic substrate HHL in normal subjects and patients with untreated sarcoidosis, alcoholic decompensated liver cirrhosis and scleroderma. CEA was above the upper limit of normal in 60% of sarcoidosis cases and 30% of cirrhotics; it was within normal in scleroderma. The assessment of the influence of chloride concentration on CEA showed that maximum was obtained for a concentration of 300 mM. In addition the inhibitory effect of angiotensin I and the converting enzyme inhibitors SQ 14225 and MK 422 was demonstrated together with the action of high concentrations of penicillamine. The inhibitory influence of these substances was similar when added to the plasma of normal or sarcoidosis subjects.", 
    "81": "The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by captopril was used in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs to confirm that the vasoconstrictive action of endorenally synthesized angiotensin II predominates on the efferent glomerular arteriole. Ozolinone is a loop diuretic with two isomers. Only (-)- ozolinone is diuretic, whereas both isomers have a renal vasodilatory effect which predominates on the efferent glomerular arteriole. Only the diuretic isomer increases renin release. The renin hypersecretion is simultaneous with recovery from the initial fall in filtration fraction, because of postglomerular vasodilatation. This recovery does not occur with (+)- ozolinone and is inhibited by pretreatment with captopril. This confirms that vasoconstrictive action of angiotensin II predominates on the efferent glomerular arteriole. Such a vasoconstrictive effect might affect blood flow in the vasa recta, which arise from the efferent arterioles of juxtamedullary glomeruli. This action might enable the renin-angiotensin system to participate in the control of renal medullary blood flow and urinary concentration.", 
    "82": "In 19 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure the over-all hemodynamic response to captopril was compared with its effect on regional blood flow. Ninety minutes after administering a single dose of captopril (25 to 150 mg), right atrial pressure decreased from 6.1 +/- 6.1 to 3.2 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), pulmonary artery pressure from 33.1 +/- 8.3 to 26.5 +/- 9.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 22.4 +/- 6.2 to 15.2 +/- 7.4 mm Hg to (p less than 0.001), mean arterial pressure from 77.2 +/- 8.0 to 66.5 +/- 13.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and systemic vascular resistance from 1,630 +/- 503 to 1,233 +/- 443 dyne-s-cm-5 (p less than 0.001), and cardiac index increased from 2.0 +/- 0.6 to 2.4 +/- 0.7 l/minute/m2 (p less than 0.001). Despite the significant increase in cardiac index there was no increase in either hepatic blood flow (203 +/- 212 to 142 +/- 101 units, N.S.) or forearm blood flow (2.2 +/- 0.9 to 2.2 +/- 1.0 ml/100 g per minute, N.S.) after captopril. Similarly, the global reduction in systemic vascular resistance was not accompanied by a reduction in either hepatic vascular resistance (0.93 +/- 0.90 to 0.83 +/- 0.69 units, N.S.) or forearm vascular resistance (41.3 +/- 18.4 to 34.9 +/- 12.4 mm Hg/ml/100 g per minute, N.S.). The over-all improvement in hemodynamics that is seen when captopril is given to patients with severe heart failure does not apply uniformally to all vascular beds. The heterogeneous response reflects the variable vasoconstrictor part played by the renin-angiotensin system in regulating flow to individual regional circulations.", 
    "83": "The effect of captopril on cerebral blood flow was studied in five patients with severe congestive heart failure and in five control subjects. Cerebral blood flow was measured by inhalation of 133xenon and registration of its uptake and washout from the brain by single photon emission computer tomography. In addition, cerebral (internal jugular) venous oxygen tension was determined in the controls. The measurements were made before and 15, 60, and 180 minutes after a single oral dose of captopril (6.25 mg in patients with congestive heart failure and 25 mg in controls). Despite a marked decrease in blood pressure, cerebral blood flow increased slightly in the patients with severe congestive heart failure. When a correction was applied to take account of a change in arterial carbon dioxide tension, however, cerebral blood flow was unchanged after captopril administration even in patients with the greatest decrease in blood pressure, in whom a decrease in cerebral blood flow might have been expected. In the controls, blood pressure was little affected by captopril, whereas a slight, but not statistically significant, decrease in cerebral blood flow was observed. The cerebral venous oxygen tension decreased concomitantly.", 
    "84": "The intravenous 133xenon injection method was used to estimate global cerebral blood flow before and after treatment with captopril in nine patients with severe heart failure. The pretreatment mean blood pressure was 94.9 mm Hg (S.D. 13.9) and fell to 85.1 mm Hg (S.D. 18.1) after treatment with captopril for between four and 15 days. The cerebral blood flow before captopril was 61.1 ml/100 g per minute (S.D. 6.9), which was less than the value of 75.8 ml/100 g per minute found in control subjects. After treatment with captopril the cerebral blood flow increased to 73.8 ml/100 g per minute (S.D. 11.8, p less than 0.01). The fraction of carbon dioxide in the expired air was not significantly different in the two studies (4.1 +/- 0.88 versus 3.97 +/- 0.65). It is concluded that cerebral blood flow is reduced in severe heart failure and can be restored by treatment with captopril, but the reasons for the reduced flow and its improvement after converting enzyme inhibition are not known.", 
    "85": "Cerebrovascular effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were examined in normotensive and hypertensive rats. Cerebral blood flow was measured with the intracarotid 133xenon injection method in halothane-anesthetized animals. The blood-brain barrier permeability of captopril (determined with an integral-uptake method) was negligible, the permeability-surface area product in most brain regions being 1 X 10(-5) cm3/g per second, that is, three to four times lower than that of sodium ion. When administered into the cerebral ventricles to bypass the blood-brain barrier, captopril had no effect on cerebral blood flow: furthermore, cerebral blood flow autoregulation (studied by raising and lowering blood pressure) was identical to that in controls. In contrast, when given intravenously, captopril had a marked effect on cerebral blood flow autoregulation--both the lower and upper limits of autoregulation being shifted to a lower pressure (by about 20 to 30 and 50 to 60 mm Hg, respectively), and the autoregulatory range was shortened by about 40 mm Hg. This effect may be ascribed to inhibition of converting enzyme in the cerebral blood vessels rather than within the brain.", 
    "86": "The effect on large arteries of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was studied in men with sustained essential hypertension with two different hemodynamic parameters: (1) systemic arterial compliance and (2) brachial artery diameter. After captopril administration, a 20 percent increase in arterial compliance was observed. The same increase was obtained with a 5 percent (acute experiment) and a 15 percent (short-term experiment) decrease in blood pressure, indicating that the decrease in pressure could not explain exclusively the increase in compliance. This assumption was studied with determinations of brachial artery diameter using original pulsed Doppler systems. After captopril administration, brachial artery diameter increased markedly despite the decrease in blood pressure. In addition to its effect on small arteries, the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril also has a special effect on the large arteries of patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "87": "To examine the possible contribution of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, seven such patients were studied with the hepatic venous catheterization technique, in the basal state, and after the intake of 12.5 to 25 mg of captopril. Hepatic venous wedge pressure was 22 +/- 2 mm Hg in the basal state and fell to 19 to 20 mm Hg at 45 to 90 minutes after the administration of captopril (P less than 0.05 to 0.01). Wedge to free hepatic venous pressure difference (basal 14 +/- 2 mm Hg) remained unchanged after captopril, and estimated hepatic blood flow was unaltered. Small but significant reductions in arterial blood pressures were seen after the administration of captopril. Aldosterone concentrations decreased whereas renin activity tended to increase after captopril. It is concluded that captopril inhibits the renin-angiotensin system in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, but fails significantly to decrease portal venous pressure. Captopril is thus unlikely to favorably influence the incidence of bleeding in these patients.", 
    "88": "The acute effects of the oral angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on hepatic blood flow and systemic hemodynamics were studied in six patients with essential hypertension. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 141.9 +/- 6.9 mm Hg to 130.2 +/- 6.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) one hour after the administration of captopril. There was no significant change in other hemodynamic values, but hepatic blood flow decreased uniformly from 1,127 +/- 115 ml per minute to 841 +/- 93 ml per minute (p less than 0.001).", 
    "89": "The increased total peripheral resistance that characterizes essential hypertension is generally reversed by antihypertensive drugs, but the reduction may not be uniform in all regions of the body. In this study, regional blood flow was investigated immediately after the oral administration of 25 mg of captopril in 11 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Within 90 minutes, the total vascular resistance decreased significantly, and the decrease was significant in the kidney. It decreased but not significantly in the splanchnic organs, the skeletal musculature, and the skin. In no region was the blood flow reduced. As captopril has no direct effect on smooth muscle, these effects are likely to have been due to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "90": "Changes in regional hemodynamics and function of the kidney during inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme were studied in 25 patients with renovascular hypertension. A variety of patterns were observed depending upon (1) the activity of the renin-angiotensin system and concomitant administration of diuretics, and (2) the presence of bilateral renal artery stenosis. Increase in blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion during angiotensin blockade, in some instances, indicated tonic renal vasoconstriction before therapy. Release of the kidney from these effects may explain, in part, the sustained effectiveness of converting enzyme inhibition in chronic congestive heart failure. When compared with blood pressure reduction due to nitroprusside administration, initial captopril therapy in patients with unilateral stenosis produced a selective decrease in glomerular filtration, despite well-preserved renal blood flow. These results confirm the importance of efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction due to angiotensin II in man. Experimental studies demonstrate that angiotensin may become critical to sustaining glomerular filtration rate in the presence of stenosis during vasodilation. In patients with bilateral stenosis, this effect produces a syndrome of functional renal insufficiency. Taken together, these data demonstrate an intrarenal action of angiotensin II in human renovascular hypertension and underscore the importance of evaluating the functional impact of changes in regional hemodynamics.", 
    "91": "Among vascular beds, that of the kidney is especially responsive to angiotensin II, perhaps a reflection of the fact that the renin-angiotensin axis is normally a volume-control rather than a pressure-control system. The dose of angiotensin required to induce renal vasoconstriction in a normal subject receiving a typical, liberal sodium intake, for example, is about an order of magnitude lower than that required to induce a pressor response. Indeed, compelling arguments can be made for a local, intrarenal role as angiotensin's first action in phylogeny, with additional cardiovascular and endocrine responses arising later. In patients with essential hypertension, in whom renal vascular tone is commonly increased, converting enzyme inhibitors such as teprotide and captopril induce a potentiated acute renal vascular response: renal blood flow increases more than it does in normal subjects. The result is a consistent, early increase in sodium excretion and an occasional increase in glomerular filtration rate. Reduced aldosterone release consequent to the block of angiotensin II formation also contributes to the natriuresis and results in positive potassium balance. With long-term therapy, renal function tends to be very well maintained. In renal artery stenosis the situation is more complex: as perfusion pressure distal to the stenosis falls, typically afferent arteriolar dilatation exists and glomerular capillary pressure tends to be maintained by an increase in postglomerular resistance. To the extent that this increase is angiotensin-mediated, suppression of angiotensin formation with captopril can reduce glomerular capillary pressure and thus filtration rate. This is well tolerated in the patient with unilateral stenosis and a healthy contralateral kidney, but can provoke renal failure when the stenosis is bilateral or involves a solitary kidney. The available evidence suggests that the converting enzyme inhibitor's influence on the kidney primarily reflects reduced angiotensin II formation, although reduced kinin degradation or increased prostaglandin synthesis may also have an influence. Whatever the mechanism responsible for the renal response, there are compelling reasons for suspecting that the salutary action of captopril on the kidney makes a substantial contribution to its over-all efficacy in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "92": "Dietary sodium restriction is associated with a rapid decrease in urinary sodium excretion and achievement of a new sodium balance within three to five days. In addition, renal vasoconstriction and progressive activation of intrarenal systems with vasoconstrictor (renin-angiotensin) or vasodilating (kallikrein-kinin and prostaglandins) properties are observed. The relationship between sodium homeostasis and the renin-angiotensin system was assessed through the use of captopril in the rat. Treatment with captopril, before and during a six-day period after suppression of dietary sodium, was associated with sodium wasting (urinary sodium always exceeded sodium intake during the observation period); in addition, the normal increase in urinary aldosterone was blunted by about 80 percent. When captopril treatment was given for six days to rats maintained on long-term sodium restriction (at least four weeks) urinary sodium increased, although transiently; at the end of the study, renal vasodilatation together with a redistribution of glomerular blood flow to nonsuperficial glomeruli was observed. These studies indicate that captopril administration markedly blunts the renal and systemic adaptations to a reduced sodium intake in the rat. They suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is probably indispensable in preventing sodium loss when dietary sodium is suppressed.", 
    "93": "Patients with hypertension have a high incidence of coronary artery disease. Captopril, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was given to eight patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease; it decreased mean arterial pressure from 121 to 103 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) but had no effect on heart rate. The rate-pressure product decreased from 12.5 to 11.4 X 10(3) (p less than 0.01). The change in coronary blood flow (90 to 80 ml per minute) and myocardial oxygen consumption (965 to 852 ml per minute) tended to parallel the decrease in the rate-pressure product. Captopril did not change global myocardial lactate (20 to 34 percent) or oxygen (9.6 to 10.0 volume percent) extraction. Hence, captopril decreases the rate-pressure product and tends to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption without causing global myocardial metabolic deterioration.", 
    "94": "An abundance of evidence suggests that glomerular ultrafiltration is significantly influenced by alterations in circulating or local concentrations of a variety of vasoactive substances. Angiotensin II regulates whole kidney glomerular filtration rate by influencing one or more of the determinants of single nephron glomerular filtration rate, particularly the ultrafiltration coefficient and glomerular plasma flow rate. The glomerular mesangial cell may be an important target for angiotensin II by virtue of its ability to contract and thereby reduce glomerular capillary surface area and ultrafiltration coefficient. These control mechanisms are not only important under physiologic conditions but they may also be activated by a variety of insults and thereby contribute to the decrease in glomerular filtration rate observed in a broad spectrum of renal disease.", 
    "95": "The systemic and regional circulatory effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition were investigated in 30 normal subjects and in 36 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Regional blood flow was measured in individual patient groups. Cardiac index rose and systemic vascular resistance fell in normal subjects after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. In the patients with heart failure, a similar rise in cardiac index and fall in systemic resistance occurred. In addition, right and left ventricular filling pressures decreased. The fall in systemic vascular resistance correlated with plasma renin activity (r = 0.57, p less than or equal to 0.001). Of the regional circulations investigated in normal subjects, only forearm blood flow increased after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Although over-all there was no change in renal or coronary blood flow, coronary flow dramatically increased in some patients and the increase in flow correlated with plasma renin activity (r = 0.939, p less than or equal to 0.001). In patients with heart failure, forearm, splanchnic, and coronary flow were unaffected by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, whereas renal blood flow estimated from para-aminohippurate clearance increased 60 percent and accounted for 50 percent of the increase in cardiac output seen in these patients. Thus, redistribution of flow occurs in congestive heart failure with a significant reduction in the fraction flow to the kidneys when compared with normal flow. The contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the regulation of regional blood flow is different in normal subjects and in patients with heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition augments skeletal flow in normal subjects whereas it increases renal blood flow in patients with heart failure.", 
    "96": "In Wistar rats, rendered pulmonary hypertensive by chronic confinement in normobaric \"hypoxic cages\", impairment of transmembrane transport of calcium by Verapamil and blockage of the action of Angiotensin I converting enzyme by Captopril when applied simultaneously did not show an additive effect in reducing the rise of pulmonary artery pressure and decreasing the augmentation of right ventricular mass. Similarly, the action of Verapamil together with decrease of prostaglandin synthetase activity by Aspirin showed no additive effect. Although in this way the results of the present study failed to give substantial support to the idea of the existence of several mediators of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, they by no means deny this possibility.", 
    "97": "In low-renin hypertensive patients, the acute effect of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, was evaluated in relation to the response of plasma bradykinin (PBK) levels as a parameter of its inhibitory effect on kininase II. Captopril significantly lowered the blood pressure and increased PBK levels. While there was no significant relationship between the reduction of blood pressure and pretreatment plasma renin activity, a significant correlation was observed between the antihypertensive effect of captopril and changes in PBK (r = -0.834, p less than 0.01, n = 10). Furthermore, in a patient with primary aldosteronism and, also, in a patient with glucocorticoid responsive hyperaldosteronism, captopril increased plasma PBK with reduction of the blood pressure. It is likely, therefore, that in low-renin hypertension, the vasodepressor effect of acute converting enzyme inhibition is due mainly to kinin accumulation rather than inhibition of angiotensin II formation.", 
    "98": "23 patients with a mean age of 62 +/- 7 years and suffering from a cardiomyopathy with severe chronic heart failure (16 patients in stage IV of the New York Association (NYHA) classification and 7 in stage III NYHA) received long term treatment with captopril (9 patients received 75 mg/day, 9 received 150 mg/day and 5 received 300 mg/day) with a follow-up of 12 +/- 9 months. Following the acute administration of captopril, there was an increase in the cardiac index (Cl) (2.76 +/- 0.56 vs 2.10 +/- 0.4 l . min-1 . m-2, p less than 0.001) between the 4th and 6th hour, a significant decrease in peripheral resistance (PR) (1416 +/- 304 vs 1094 +/- 406 dynes/s/cm-5, p less than 0.001), total pulmonary resistance (TPR) (537 +/- 228 vs 660 +/- 258 dynes/s/cm-5, p less than 0.01) and pulmonary diastolic pressure (PDP) (15.4 +/- 7.2 vs 18.6 +/- mm Hg, p less than 0.001). An early (3rd day) and reversible renal failure caused the treatment to be suspended in one patient. In the 22 other patients, a marked and lasting clinical improvement was obtained (18 patients with stage II NYHA and 4 with stage III NYHA). The beneficial haemodynamic effects persisted until the 4th month in 14 patients (Cl: 2.38 +/- 0.4 vs 2.10 +/- 0.4 l . min-1 . m-2, p less than 0.1; PR: 1828 +/- 314 vs 2054 +/- 406 dynes/s/cm-5, p less than 0.01; TPR: 526 +/- 284 vs 660 +/- 258 dynes/s/cm-5, p less than 0.01; PDP: 16.8 +/- 8.7 vs 18.6 +/- 8.6 mmHg, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "99": "Captopril, an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered to 15 patients with essential hypertension. The serum lipid peroxides level, aldosterone concentration in plasma and blood pressure decreased rapidly after administration, while plasma renin activity was not significantly changed. It is suggested that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by captopril offers a possible therapeutic approach to the treatment of atherosclerosis complicated with hypertension.", 
    "100": "We report two children of a family with congenital adrenocortical unresponsiveness to ACTH. Repeated stimulation of the adrenal by Synthetic 1-24 ACTH (Synacthen) failed to increase cortisol secretion, but produced significant rises of serum aldosterone. This was, however, associated with increased plasma renin activity. Only when the renin-angiotensin effect was eliminated, by a converting enzyme blocker, did Synacthen fail to affect serum aldosterone. These data support the view that glucocorticoid deficiency in this disorder results from unresponsiveness to ACTH and that development of the zona glomerulosa and normal aldosterone secretion is achieved by action of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "101": "The effects of captopril (intravenous loading dose of 20 mg, 1 h later followed by 10 mg infused during the next h) on arterial blood pressure and plasma renin activity were followed in 4 goats during the last months of pregnancy, during lactation and during anestrus. Experiments were made both when the animals were sodium-repleted and sodium-deficient. Furosemide and dietary restriction were used to deprive the animals of sodium. In sodium-replete animals, captopril caused a more pronounced fall in mean arterial blood pressure and a larger increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) when the animals were pregnant than when they were lactating or in anestrus. During sodium-deficient conditions the response was similar as during sodium repletion in pregnant goats. In anestral goats, PRA rose in response to captopril, but the blood pressure fall was similar as when the goats were sodium-replete. In lactating sodium-deficient goats, captopril caused a marked fall in mean arterial blood pressure concomitant with a 2-3 times higher rise in PRA than during corresponding sodium-repletion experiments. The respiratory rate was elevated in pregnant animals and increased further during captopril. The plasma vasopressin concentration did not change during captopril-induced hypotension. If the blood pressure fell greater than or equal to 10 mmHg the animals became very quiet and occasionally they fell asleep. All goats delivered healthy kids. The fact that the blood pressure fall was marked and consistent in all animals during pregnancy, but less and more variable during anestrus indicates that the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is of greater importance for blood pressure maintenance during pregnancy than during anestrus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "102": "A reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure was developed for the simultaneous assay of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide in a combination tablet formulation. Gradient elution was used to quantify these two drugs, as well as the oxidized form of captopril, the disulfide. Tablets were extracted with methanol and, after centrifugation, were chromatographed. Initially, a methanol-0.05% aqueous phosphoric acid (25:75, v/v) solution was pumped at 2 mL/min into a phenyl column. After 8 min, the flow rate was increased to 4.5 mL/min and the methanol content of the mobile phase was increased to 45% to elute the disulfide. Detection was at 210 nm. Linearity and repeatability of all constituents were satisfactory. The hydrolytic degradation product of hydrochlorothiazide, 4-amino-6-chloro-1,3-benzene disulfonamide (also called the disulfonamide ), could be resolved in test solutions but was not visible in chromatograms of tablets carried through the gradient procedure even after storage at elevated temperatures for prolonged time periods prior to assay. The method can be automated.", 
    "103": "The purpose of this study was to determine if the increase in small intestinal fluid absorption observed after extracellular fluid (ECF) reduction is mediated by angiotensin II (AII). Infusion of AII at doses that increase plasma levels of the hormone within the physiological range stimulates jejunal fluid absorption. In contrast, at pharmacological doses that result in plasma AII levels unlikely to be encountered normally, the hormone inhibits absorption and/or stimulates jejunal secretion. The AII stimulation of jejunal fluid absorption is potentiated by nephrectomy, suggesting that the endogenous levels of AII are related to and have an important role in regulation of the cellular level of its own receptors. Extracellular volume reduction as a result of sodium depletion, nonhypotensive hemorrhage, or water deprivation increases jejunal fluid absorption 30-40% above control values. This increase in jejunal absorption after ECF reduction is not affected by adrenalectomy, but is abolished by nephrectomy, either alone or in combination with adrenalectomy. Captopril, prazosin, and peripheral sympathectomy also abolish the increase in jejunal absorption following ECF depletion. It is suggested that AII is generated after ECF reduction and increases jejunal fluid absorption by facilitating the release of norepinephrine from enteric sympathetic nerves. Thus, AII is a physiologically important mediator of jejunal fluid absorption.", 
    "104": "Potassium and angiotensin (AII) show interdependence as stimuli of aldosterone production. However, potassium stimulates in vitro in the absence of AII. In the present study we examined for a contribution by AII to the in vitro stimulatory potential of potassium, an AII effect mediated on the adrenal before killing of the animal. Captopril, an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor, was administered orally and by sc injection for 3 days so as to decrease levels of AII. Aldosterone secretory responses by adrenal capsules to graded increments in potassium were measured subsequently using a perifusion system. It was found that captopril pretreatment significantly reduced the magnitude of aldosterone secretory response to increments in potassium of 0.5 to 6.0 mM, from a baseline potassium concentration of 3.5 mM. Responses to the lowest increment in potassium, 0.5 and 1.0 mM, were virtually abolished by captopril treatment. The results suggest that AII sensitizes the adrenal glomerulosa such that very small changes in potassium concentration can affect aldosterone production.", 
    "105": "We report the first case of congenital renal arteriovenous fistula in which renin-mediated arterial hypertension was the only clinical manifestation.", 
    "106": "The effects of captopril on mean arterial blood pressure and proximal tubular fluid reabsorption (JV) were examined in anaesthetized normotensive rats and in the non-clipped kidneys of two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. In the normotensive animals, captopril reduced arterial blood pressure from 121 +/- SD 9 to 106 +/- 10 mmHg and JV decreased from 3.78 +/- 0.45 to 2.57 +/- 0.58 X 10(-4) mm3 mm-2 s-1. Captopril had a greater effect on blood pressure in the hypertensive animals (172 +/- 17 reduced to 133 +/- 23 mmHg) although the decrease in JV from 3.62 +/- 0.12 to 2.40 +/- 0.40 was similar to that observed in normotensive animals. These results provide evidence that, in the anaesthetized rat, angiotensin II contributes to the maintenance of the rate of proximal fluid reabsorption. The magnitude of the angiotensin-stimulated component of proximal fluid absorption is similar in normotensive and two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats.", 
    "107": "Hind paw oedema in rats, measured by plethysmography or extravasation of Evans Blue dye into the skin, after subplantar injection of submaximal doses of carrageenin (1-100 micrograms) was significantly increased for 4 h during kininase II inhibition with captopril (1 mg kg-1, s.c.). Submaximal oedema, as assessed by paw swelling, after subplantar bradykinin (0.1-1.0 microgram) was also significantly increased after subcutaneous administration of this dose of captopril, whereas that in response to either histamine (2-20 micrograms) or prostaglandin E2 (2 micrograms) was unchanged. The pain threshold of the paw, injected with carrageenin (1 microgram) was lowered significantly after subcutaneous administration of captopril (1 mg kg-1). Potentiation by captopril (1 mg kg-1, s.c.) of paw swelling in response to intraplantar carrageenin (100 micrograms) or bradykinin (1 microgram) was reduced by prior subcutaneous administration of indomethacin (5 mg kg-1). It is suggested that normally, tissue kininase II activity is sufficient to decrease the inflammatory response of the hind paw to carrageenin or bradykinin. After inhibition of kininase II with captopril, bradykinin levels are increased and interact with concomitantly released prostaglandins to potentiate inflammation.", 
    "108": "We describe a new principle for the determination of enzymes, here applied to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) in human serum. The enzyme inhibitor binding assay is based on specific binding of labeled inhibitor to the active center of the enzyme. Serum (10-15 microL) is incubated with 125I-labeled ACE inhibitor (\" 351A ,\" a p- hydroxybenzamidine derivative of N-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline) at pH 7.0 at 37 degrees C for 2 h in a non-equilibrated system. Inhibitor bound to ACE is separated by adsorption to coated charcoal, the radioactivity remaining in the supernate is counted, and the ACE value is calculated from a standard curve. Sensitivity for ACE in serum is 200 U/L, corresponding to 5.0 ng of ACE purified from human lung. The coefficient of variation was 3.9% within assay, and 6.4% between assays for normal ACE activities. Correlation with a comparison spectrophotometric method (Am J Med 59: 363-372, 1975) for ACE assay was excellent (r = 0.98) in 59 samples from healthy subjects and from patients with various diseases including active sarcoidosis. The novel assay principle presented here is simple and specific, and can be extended to use with various biological fluids and tissues, and to other enzymes as well.", 
    "109": "The authors studied 12 patients who required deliberate hypotension for spinal fusion operations in order to investigate the efficacy of captopril for reducing dose requirement for sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Six patients, selected at random, were pretreated with captopril, 3 mg/kg po, and the remaining six patients served as controls. All patients received a similar anesthetic technique, consisting of thiopental 3 mg/kg, pancuronium 0.1 mg/kg, morphine 0.5 mg/kg, plus nitrous oxide 70% in oxygen. SNP was used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 50-55 mmHg during deliberate hypotension lasting 140 +/- 13 minutes (mean +/- SE). Patients who received captopril required less SNP than untreated patients both early during hypotension (1.4 +/- 0.5 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.8 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1, P less than 0.05), as well as late during hypotension (2.2 +/- 0.2 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.6 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1, P less than 0.05). Whole blood cyanide was significantly lower in the patients pretreated with captopril than the untreated controls both early in the hypotensive period (2.7 +/- 0.6 mumol/l vs. 13 +/- 4 mumol/l, P less than 0.05) and also late in the hypotensive period (3.7 +/- 0.8 mumol/l vs. 30 +/- 10 mumol/l, P less than 0.05). MAP was reduced by captopril pretreatment both following induction of anesthesia (64 +/- 4 mmHg captopril vs. 80 +/- 4 mmHg control, P less than 0.05) and during surgery before deliberate hypotension (86 +/- 5 mmHg captopril vs. 100 +/- 4 control, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "110": "Although the short-term hemodynamic and clinical responses to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) are well known, little information is available about the long-term results of captopril therapy. In the present study, 15 stable outpatients received captopril therapy and were followed for a mean of 19 months (range 6 to 27) with serial clinical assessments and measurements of exercise tolerance, ejection fraction (EF) and cardiothoracic ratio. Exercise tolerance on a modified Naughton protocol improved from 10.5 +/- 2.7 to 12.7 +/- 2.4 minutes (mean +/- standard deviation) at 3 months (p less than 0.001), tended to increase progressively up to 12 months and remained significantly increased even after 24 months (9.7 +/- 1.8 vs 13.5 +/- 4.0 minutes, p less than 0.05). However, individual responses were variable; 4 patients did not show measurable improvement. Left ventricular EF increased from 0.20 +/- 0.06 to 0.25 +/- 0.06 (p less than 0.01) at 3 months and remained higher (0.30 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.02) at latest follow-up. Cardiothoracic ratio decreased from 0.59 +/- 0.04 to 0.56 +/- 0.05 (p less than 0.02) at 3 months and remained significantly lower at 12 months and at latest follow-up, although again individual responses were variable. Clinical responses generally correlated with these objective measurements, with clinical classification on a scale modified from the New York Heart Association classification improving from 3.0 +/- 0.6 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 (p less than 0.01) at 3 months and remaining improved throughout the follow-up period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In rats, L-681,176 exhibits a dose-related inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I with an ID50 of 142 mg/kg when administered intravenously.

    "114": "Enalapril is a converting enzyme inhibitor with a prolonged duration of action. We investigated the arterial pressure and hormonal responses to angiotensin I infusion(s) in eight normotensive human volunteers at various intervals after administration of 10 mg enalapril to assess more precisely its duration of action, particularly in relationship to angiotensin II's influence on aldosterone secretion and renal vasoconstriction. In normotensive sodium-restricted subjects, there was significant attenuation (p less than 0.025) of diastolic blood pressure response to angiotensin I infusion even as long as 28 h after administration of enalapril. This was accompanied by a significant (p less than 0.02) accumulation of angiotensin I and reduction of the angiotensin II increment in response to angiotensin I infusion. In contrast to the persistent efficacy of enalapril, as assessed by angiotensin I infusion, basal levels of angiotension II had returned to control levels by 22-24 h postdrug. Yet there was a persistent reduction of diastolic blood pressure even as long as 28 h postdrug. The persistent hypotension could not be explained on the basis of changes in other potential vasoactive factors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, bradykinin, or prostaglandin), as none of these was significantly modified by enalapril administration. In summary, enalapril in a dose of 10 mg p.o. produced a significant reduction in blood pressure in this study for up to 28 h. Unlike captopril, enalapril does not modify circulating prostaglandins and kinins. Although the level of activation of the renin-angiotensin system had returned to control values 24 h after enalapril administration, there was evidence from the angiotensin I infusions of continued blockade of the angiotensin-converting enzyme for as long as 28 h.", 
    "115": "Enalaprilat (MK-422), a new and potent angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor, and its monoethyl ester precursor, enalapril, were studied in a single pass perfused rat liver preparation under constant perfusate flow (10 ml/min) at concentrations of 0.29-0.41 microM for 14C-enalapril and 0.01-0.015 microM for 3H- enalaprilat . During their simultaneous delivery to the same rat liver preparation, the steady state hepatic extraction ratio of 14C-enalapril was high (0.861 +/- 0.02) and 14C- enalaprilat appeared rapidly in effluent perfusate plasma. Of the enalapril dose, 22.7 +/- 6.9% appeared in bile. 14C- Enalaprilat accounted for 79% of the total radioactivity in bile (18% of dose) whereas 14C-enalapril was present only as 10% of the total (2.3% of dose). By contrast, the steady state hepatic extraction of 3H- enalaprilat was very low (0.053) and the disappearance was virtually identical to the appearance of 3H- enalaprilat in bile. These findings suggest that diffusional barrier exists for enalaprilat as the preformed metabolite, which hinders penetration into hepatocytes, and therefore, elimination. The precursor, enalapril, effectively brings enalaprilat into hepatocytes were more extensive biliary excretion of the generated metabolite takes place. This account adds to our further understanding of metabolite kinetics; in addition to the uneven distribution of enzyme system and the intrinsic clearance for metabolite formation and elimination, the presence of a diffusional barrier is another important determinant which may cause deviations between the kinetics of a generated and performed metabolite.", 
    "116": "Disturbances in body water and electrolytes that trigger sodium appetite, such as sodium depletion or hypovolemia, are potent activators of the renin-angiotensin system. In the absence of an actual deficit in body fluids, angiotensin injections are adequate to stimulate increased sodium ingestion. To assess whether angiotensin is a significant mediator of sodium appetite induced by acute alterations in body fluids, sodium intake was examined in rats during central or peripheral angiotensin blockade. Central blockade of angiotensin receptors by intracerebroventricular (ICVT) injection of the analogue antagonist saralasin decreased (but did not eliminate) sodium intake after polethylene glycol-induced hypovolemia or sodium depletion resulting from dialysis against glucose. Conversely, peripheral blockade of angiotensin converting enzyme with orally active captopril potentiated rather than decreased sodium appetite and stimulated water intake after sodium depletion. This increased water and salt intake after peripheral inhibition of converting enzyme was reversed, however, by concurrent central blockade of angiotensin receptors. These data support the hypothesis that angiotensin participates in sodium appetite associated with acute alteration in body fluids. Furthermore, the brain is the site at which angiotensin exerts its influence on sodium appetite. While the involvement of angiotensin of brain origin is not ruled out, the change in sodium appetite after peripheral blockade of converting enzyme suggests that circulating angiotensin derived from renal renin may interact with central angiotensin receptors regulating sodium appetite.", 
    "117": "44 patients with refractory heart failure (RHF) were treated with a conversion enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Prior to treatment, 26 patients had stage IV RHF and 18 patients had stage III RHF (NYHA). The course of the trial was marked by early deaths (6 months) in 9 cases (20.4%), early treatment failure in 8 cases (18.2%), intolerance in 3 cases (6.8%) and 3 patients (6.8%) were lost to follow-up. 21 patients (48%) were improved by the treatment and were followed for a mean of 16 months +/- 8.6. The mean dosage of captopril was 157 mg per day in 3 oral doses (range: 75 to 300 mg per day). The pulmonary capillary pressure dropped, on average, from 30 +/- 10 mm Hg to 21 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) by the 8th day and remained stable thereafter. The cardiac index increased by 40%. The heart rate decreased by a mean of 10.4%, by the time of the first examination. The mean blood pressure was not significantly modified. Side effects which resolved after changing the dosage were seen in one third of cases: renal failure (4 cases), hypotension (2 cases), hyperkalaemia (1 case). In the long term, 6 patients (2.6%) died after a mean delay of 15.6 +/- 5.3 months.", 
    "118": "The effect of oral captopril (30 mg/kg per day) on the blood pressure, plasma aldosterone concentration, urinary electrolytes and brain angiotensin-converting enzyme activity of spontaneously hypertensive rats of the Okamoto strain was examined. Over a seven day period, captopril caused a progressive fall in blood pressure with increased sodium excretion and urine volume and a significant fall in plasma aldosterone concentration. Following captopril, angiotensin converting enzyme activity increased significantly in the midbrain and medulla oblongata; the pituitary level of angiotensin converting enzyme activity was significantly decreased. The hypotensive action of captopril in the spontaneously hypertensive rat is associated with changes in body sodium, water and plasma aldosterone concentration. The alterations in brain angiotensin-converting enzyme activity following captopril treatment suggest that, with chronic administration, captopril can alter the activity of the brain renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "119": "In superfused anterior pituitary reaggregate cell cultures angiotensin II (AII) stimulated both spontaneous and dopamine-inhibited prolactin (PRL) release from subnanomolar concentrations. Angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin III (AIII) also stimulated PRL release. The magnitude and rate of response to AI was equal to or only slightly lower than that to AII. However, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril and teprotide (1 microM) completely abolished the PRL response to 0.1 nM AI and strongly reduced that to 1 nM AI. The intrinsic activity of AIII was lower than that of AII but could be enhanced by adding 2 microM of the aminopeptidase inhibitor amastatin to the superfusion medium. After withdrawal of AIII, PRL secretion rate rapidly returned to baseline levels, whereas after withdrawal of AI or AII, secretion fell to a level remaining significantly higher than basal release. The present findings indicate that stimulation of PRL release by AI is weak unless it is converted into AII by ACE and that aminopeptidase may be important in determining the magnitude and termination of the PRL response. Furthermore, the active peptides induce a different pattern of response.", 
    "120": "The effect of exogenous and locally generated angiotensin II (ANG II) on the release of beta-endorphin (beta-END) from anterior pituitary cell cultures of rats was studied. Angiotensin I (ANG I) and ANG II stimulated the release of beta-END, the ANG I effects being inhibited by addition of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Renin and angiotensinogen had no effect when given separately, but their combination increased beta-END release. Thus ANG II causes the release of beta-END, but the putative pituitary renin system cannot be stimulated by exogenous renin or angiotensinogen; converting enzyme, however, acts locally to produce biologically active ANG II from ANG I.", 
    "121": "Using a continuous spectrophotometric assay, inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme by captopril and by the active diacid derivative of enalapril was reinvestigated. The onset of inhibition was comparatively slow, but the inhibition achieved was stronger than previous estimates: approximate Ki-values were 0.3 nM for captopril and 0.06 nM for enalapril diacid. The rate-constants for association and dissociation of these enzyme-inhibitor complexes were estimated, and half-times of approximately 12 min for the captopril complex and 60 min for the enalapril diacid complex were calculated. The rate of dissociation of the captopril-enzyme complex was measured directly by reacting the thiol group in free captopril with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and observing the reactivation of the enzyme; a half-time of approximately 30 min was obtained. Therefore the release of these inhibitors from the enzyme may be slow enough to affect the duration of their hypotensive action.", 
    "122": "Captopril was perfused through isolated rat hearts; its effects after local ischemia and reperfusion were assessed. Upon reperfusion all untreated (10 out of 10) but only 4 (out of 10) captopril-treated (80 micrograms/ml) hearts fibrillated (P less than 0.02). Purine overflow increased upon reperfusion but was reduced by captopril (597 +/- 62 and 333 +/- 41 nmol/min gdwt respectively; P less than 0.05). The pressure-rate index and the apex displacement were severely impaired after 30 min of reperfusion (32 +/- 16 and 10 +/- 5% respectively of initial values) but captopril reduced the injury of mechanical function (60 +/- 8; P less than 0.05 and 61 +/- 11; P less than 0.05 respectively). These results show that captopril reduces ventricular fibrillation and the loss of high energy phosphate nucleotides and thereby partly maintains mechanical function impaired by ischemia and reperfusion.", 
    "123": "The present study describes a differential inhibitory effect of captopril and [Sar1 Ala8]angiotensin II (saralasin) on the neurogenic vasoconstriction in pithed normotensive rats. In pithed normotensive rats with intact kidneys captopril more profoundly inhibited the vasopressor response to spinal stimulation than observed for saralasin. Bilateral nephrectomy also diminished the hypertensive response to spinal stimulation. After bilateral nephrectomy, 1 h previously, captopril but not saralasin diminished the hypertensive response to spinal stimulation. After bilateral nephrectomy, 18-24 h previously, captopril did not produce an additional reduction of the vasopressor response to spinal stimulation. In contrast, saralasin significantly potentiated the neurogenic vasoconstriction. The results suggest that both captopril and saralasin diminish the hypertensive response to spinal stimulation by producing dilatation of vascular smooth muscle in pithed normotensive rats. Apart from this common mechanism, a differential effect of captopril and saralasin on the neurogenic vasoconstriction can be observed. In contrast to saralasin, captopril may depress the neurogenic vasoconstriction in pithed normotensive rats by blocking the sympathofacilitatory action induced by subpressor levels of angiotensin II (AII). In pithed normotensive rats, saralasin may mimic the sympathofacilitatory action of subpressor AII.", 
    "124": "The optimal dose of Captopril was evaluated by hourly haemodynamic monitoring in 10 patients with chronic congestive cardiac failure (Stage IV of the NYHA Classification) after administration of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg of Captopril. A similar improvement was observed in all the parameters considered with all three dosages. At its peak effect (90 minutes) 25 mg of Captopril caused a fall in pulmonary capillary, and mean pulmonary artery pressures, and a fall in systemic resistance of 40%, 20% and 30% respectively; with 50 mg of Captopril, the effect was a fall of 36%, 24% and 35% respectively. The cardiac index rose by 17% with 25 mg of Captopril, 28% with 50 mg and 12% with 100 mg of Captopril. Although the fall in pulmonary capillary pressure remained significant up to the 6th hour, the improvement in cardiac index was not significant after the 3rd hour. After 8 days' treatment, plasma renin activity increased from 7.01 +/- 4.68 to 23.6 +/- 18.3 ng/ml/hour (p less than 0.02) and serum aldosterone fell from 1.175 +/- 386 p. moles/l to 497 +/- 277 p. moles/l (p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between basal plasma renin activity and pre- or post-therapeutic systemic resistances. The clinical and haemodynamic improvement was sustained after 2 months' treatment in 5 of these patients without side effects. Increasing the dosage of Captopril does not reinforce or prolong its action; moderate doses (25 mg) are as effective as high doses (100 mg). Captopril, which acts by inhibiting the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system is the current treatment of choice in severe refractory cardiac failure.", 
    "125": "Right ventricular function plays an important role in many cardiac disorders. Changes in left ventricular function, right ventricular afterload and preload, cardiac medications and ischemia may affect right ventricular function. Radionuclide ventriculography permits quantitative assessment of regional and global function of the right ventricle. This assessment can be made at rest, during exercise or after pharmacologic interventions. The overlap between right ventricle and right atrium is a major limitation for gated scintigraphic techniques. The use of imaging with newer short-lived radionuclides may permit more accurate and reproducible assessment of right ventricular function by means of the first pass method. Further work in areas related to improvement of techniques and the impact of right ventricular function on prognosis is needed.", 
    "126": "The specificity of pepstatin A as an inhibitor of the cardiovascular actions of renin injected into anaesthetized rats has been investigated. Pepstatin A 70 micrograms/kg/min partially inhibited the pressor response to injected renin without affecting the pressor responses to injected angiotensin II, phenylephrine or vasopressin. Pepstatin A 150 micrograms/kg/min also produced partial inhibition of injected renin, but in addition caused significant inhibition of the other pressor agents. This was in contrast to the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, 100 micrograms/kg i.v., which caused greater inhibition of the renin pressor response than pepstatin A without affecting the pressor response to injected angiotensin II, phenylephrine or vasopressin. Finally the direct acting vasodilator hydralazine was found to have a similar non-specific inhibitory effect to pepstatin A on the pressor responses to injected pressor agents. It is concluded that pepstatin A reduces the pressor responsiveness to injected pressor agents and that this non-specific cardiovascular activity limits the usefulness of pepstatin A as a pharmacological tool to inhibit renal renin in vivo.", 
    "127": "Five cases of accelerated or malignant hypertension which occurred in young adults within a few weeks of renal segmental infarction are reported here. Such infarction appears to give rise to a form of renovascular hypertension, the severity and sudden onset of which distinguishes it from renal fibrodysplasia, which is commonly observed in this age group. In three cases hypertension was corrected by nephrectomy. In two cases several months medical treatment was associated with remission of hypertension without surgery. It is therefore suggested that hypertension due to renal infarction, unlike that caused by fibromuscular dysplasia, may be managed by prolonged medical treatment.", 
    "128": "Application of a solid renal artery clip (0.25 mm i.d.) in rats with an undisturbed contralateral kidney (two-kidney one clip renal hypertension; 2KH ) causes a small increase in blood pressure within the first 3 hr. After pretreatment of the animals with aspirin the blood pressure response was enhanced. In contrast, in unilaterally nephrectomized rats after clipping(one-kidney one clip renal hypertension; 1KH ), the increase in blood pressure of the control and aspirin pretreated group was similar and at the level of the aspirin pretreated group of the 2KH -rats. One day after clipping in the 2KH -rats there was still a marked enhancement of the blood pressure increase induced by the prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitor. Plasma renin activity of the aspirin and control group 1 hr after clipping was significantly increased as compared to the sham operated animals in as well the 2KH - and 1KH -rats. The converting enzyme inhibitor captopril attenuates the acute increase in blood pressure in both control and aspirin treated 2KH - and 1KH -rats pointing to a major role for angiotensin II. It is suggested that the potentiation of blood pressure after prostaglandin synthesis inhibition is due to a diminished release of prostaglandins by the contralateral kidney. The data indicate that in intact rats prostaglandins may act as breaking mechanism against hypertensive influences such as a sudden increase in blood pressure by angiotensin II.", 
    "129": "Scleroderma is a disease of unknown cause characterized by interstitial fibrosis and vascular lesions in many organ systems. Renal failure, often associated with malignant hypertension, may ensue as a life-threatening component of this disorder. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been hypothesized as a cause of this complication. Captopril has been used in 23 patients with this condition. Of this group, 20 (87%) responded favorably with a decrease of the supine diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg and a reduction in the serum creatinine level in 14 patients. During long-term therapy (median, 29 months), 11 of the 23 patients continued to have a good clinical response while receiving captopril. Six patients died and six patients were alive after captopril therapy was discontinued. These data suggest that captopril is beneficial in the treatment of scleroderma renal crisis.", 
    "130": "In rats, daily doses of haloperidol repeated for various time periods increase striatal Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 (YGGFMRF) immunoreactivity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This increase occurred also in other dopamine-rich brain areas. After intraventricular captopril (0.5 mg), the accumulation rate of immunoreactive YGGFMRF was greater in haloperidol- than in saline-injected rats. Intraventricular captopril inhibits the YGGFMRF degradation; hence the greater accumulation rate of YGGFMRF caused by captopril in haloperidol-treated rats suggests that this drug increases the YGGFMRF biosynthesis. A slower rate of YGGFMRF release in haloperidol-treated rats can be excluded as a cause for the drug-induced increase in striatal content of this peptide because the release rates of YGGFMRF elicited by K+ were similar in striatal slices of haloperidol- and saline-treated rats. The similarities between the accumulation rate of immunoreactive YGGFMRF and of Met5-enkephalin induced by haloperidol suggest that haloperidol increases the biosynthesis of the specific messenger RNA for preproenkephalin, an opioid peptide precursor, which contains one copy of YGGFMRF and several copies of Met5-enkephalin.", 
    "131": "The renal excretory mechanism of an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (SA-446) was examined in anesthetized dogs. Parenteral administration of this compound resulted in production of constant levels of about 2 mg/l in the plasma (PSA) and the urine concentration was 726 +/- 200 mg/l, a level significantly higher than that in the plasma. Renal clearance of SA-446 (CSA) was 2.24 +/- 0.34 ml/g X min and was significantly higher than GFR. The clearance ratio (CSA/GFR) of over 1.0 was indicative of a net tubular secretion. Administration of probenecid resulted in a significant rise in PSA and in a significant decrease in urinary excretion but with no change in the plasma protein binding ratio. CSA decreased significantly from 2.24 +/- 0.34 to 0.71 +/- 0.14 ml/g X min. The inhibitory action of SA-446 (0.02 mg/kg, i.v.) on the pressor response to angiotensin I disappeared at about 50 min, this action being maintained for about 2 h in the probenecid pretreated dog. Since probenecid is a competitive inhibitor of organic anion secretory transport, our results show the net tubular secretion of SA-446, via organic anion transport systems. Prolongation of the action of SA-446, as induced by probenecid may be due to the increase of plasma concentration, by the inhibition of tubular secretion.", 
    "132": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (ACE) was assayed in homogenized rainbow trout tissues and plasma. The physiological role of ACE was examined by injection of the ACE inhibitor captopril (SQ 14,225) into the dorsal aorta of chronically cannulated trout. Gills and corpuscles of Stannius exhibited greatest ACE activity and contained over 30 times more enzyme than plasma on a per-wet-weight basis. ACE was barely detectable in skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney tissues. Captopril lowered dorsal aortic pressure (DAP) within 1 min after injection. Pressure fell 5-7 mm Hg below control over the next 30 min and remained at this level for an additional hour. Because the gills receive the entire cardiac output they are, like the mammalian lungs, ideally situated to regulate plasma hormone levels. Activation of angiotensin II (AII) appears to be only one example of branchial metabolic capability.",

Muracein C, 3, was shown to be a muramyl pentapeptide containing N-acetylmuramic acid, alanine, glutamic acid, serine and diaminopimelic acid in a 1:2:1:1:1 ratio based on the 1H NMR integration.",

    "135": "A total of 75 male Wistar rats with one-kidney, one-clip renal hypertension was maintained on either a regular (RNa) or a low-salt (LNa) diet for 3 wk after clipping. Blood pressure in the unanesthetized rats was equally elevated independent of sodium intake. Plasma renin activity was higher in LNa animals, and blood pressure was renin dependent only in this group, as evidenced by the blood pressure response to 10 mg/kg captopril iv. There was no significant difference in plasma catecholamines between RNa and LNa rats, although in the former the sympathetic nervous system is believed to play a major role in sustaining high blood pressure. The acute intravenous administration of 0.5 mg/kg prazosin did not induce a more pronounced blood pressure fall in the RNa rats. Prazosin enhanced plasma norepinephrine levels similarly in both groups, but epinephrine levels only rose in the LNa animals. Prazosin also markedly stimulated plasma renin activity rendering blood pressure renin dependent even in RNa rats. Thus, using alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade, it has not been possible to demonstrate that the blood pressure elevation of salt-repleted one-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats is due to an enhanced sympathetic nerve activity. Data obtained with sympatholytic agents must be interpreted with great caution if renin activity cannot be kept unchanged.", 
    "136": "A single s.c. injection of 60 mg/kg of monocrotaline to rats induced pulmonary alterations characterized by hyaline thrombi of capillaries and arterioles, focal necrosis of alveolar walls, and medial thickening and intimal hyalinosis of arteries. Such pathological alterations became apparent 7 days after injection and thereafter progressively developed with the passage of time. Histometrical examination revealed a reduction of the alveolar surface area in a unit volume of lung tissue in these rats. Biochemically, lung angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was estimated to have reduced in parallel with the development of pulmonary alterations while plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was unchanged throughout the experimental period.", 
    "137": "The relation between pretreatment serum sodium concentration and the early and late effects of captopril was examined in 77 consecutive patients with severe chronic heart failure, in whom cardiac catheterization was performed during initiation of treatment and after 2 to 8 weeks. Two groups of patients were defined: 37 patients had hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 135 mEq/liter, group A) and 40 patients had a normal serum sodium concentration (greater than or equal to 135 mEq/liter, group B). With first doses of captopril, patients in group A showed more marked hemodynamic responses than did patients in group B (p less than 0.02). The changes in mean arterial pressure and left ventricular filling pressure seen with first doses of the drug varied linearly and inversely with the pretreatment serum sodium concentration (r = -0.58 and r = -0.53, respectively); this was likely related to the finding that, before administration of captopril, the serum sodium concentration varied linearly and inversely with the logarithm of the plasma renin activity (r = -0.78). However, the pretreatment serum sodium concentration did not predict the long-term hemodynamic or clinical responses to converting enzyme inhibition. Symptomatic hypotension occurred early in the course of therapy (within 24 hours of initiating captopril therapy) in 9 (12%) of the 77 patients; 8 of these 9 had severe hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mEq/liter) and comprised 53% of the 15 patients in our study with such low serum sodium concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "138": "Guanethidine is a sympatholytic antihypertensive drug used for the treatment of severe or resistant hypertension. Previous clinical studies have documented the development of tolerance to guanethidine in humans and suggested that fluid retention or increased sensitivity of arterioles to endogenous catecholamines may be responsible for the tolerance development. In this study we investigated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of tolerance to guanethidine in one-kidney, one-clip renovascular and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) using the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. In the one-kidney model, captopril (30 mg/(kg X day), orally) had no effect on the development of tolerance to guanethidine (50 mg/(kg X day), i.p.) when the drugs were coadministered for 2 wk. However, captopril enhanced the day 1 blood pressure-lowering effect and prevented the development of tolerance to guanethidine in male SHR. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in the development of tolerance to guanethidine in SHR but not in one-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats. Thus, the etiology of the hypertensive state may dictate which physiological compensatory mechanisms are activated after antihypertensive drug administration.",

This study compares the effects of long-term administration of a sulfhydryl inhibitor, captopril, with a nonsulfhydryl inhibitor, enalapril (1-[N-[1-(ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-L-proline), in conscious sodium-deficient dogs. Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma renin activity (PRA), urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), arterial pressure (AP), blood kinins (BK), urinary kinins (UK), and urinary kallikrein activity (UKA) were determined during long-term inhibition of ACE in sodium-deficient dogs. In response to captopril administration (20 mg/(kg . day], PAC decreased from 38.9 +/- 6.7 to 14.3 +/- 2.3 ng/dl, PRA increased from 3.58 +/- 0.53 to 13.7 +/- 1.6 ng/(ml . h), UNaV increased from 0.65 +/- 0.27 to 6.4 +/- 1.2 meq/day, AP decreased from 102 +/- 3 to 65 +/- 2 mm Hg, BK increased from 0.17 +/- 0.02 to 0.41 +/- 0.04 ng/ml, UK increased from 7.2 +/- 1.5 to 31.4 +/- 3.2 micrograms/day, and UKA decreased from 23.6 +/- 3.1 to 5.3 +/- 1.2 EU/day. Quantitatively similar changes in AP, UNaV, and PAC were observed in sodium-deficient dogs in response to long-term enalapril administration (4 mg/(kg X day]. In sodium-deficient dogs maintained on captopril or enalapril for several days, angiotensin II (AngII) infusion (3 ng/(kg X min] restored PAC, UNaV, and AP to levels observed in untreated sodium-deficient dogs. These data indicate that the long-term hypotensive and natriuretic actions of inhibitors of ACE are mediated by inhibition of AngII formation and that the renin-angiotensin system plays an essential role in regulating aldosterone secretion, renal function, and AP during sodium deficiency.", 
    "140": "MK-521 is a new orally active, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Single doses of 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg were administered to nine hypertensive patients alternating with placebo. All doses of MK-521 caused profound suppression of ACE activity for more than 24 h and decreased standing diastolic blood pressure for more than 12 h without changes in pulse rate. Although there was no further reduction in blood pressure with doses above 5.0 mg, the duration of action was prolonged for more than 24 h with the higher doses. Serum MK-521 concentrations increased with dosage, and ACE was inhibited maximally at concentrations above 10 ng/ml. In this initial study, MK-521 was well tolerated and proved to be a potent and long-acting antihypertensive agent.", 
    "141": "CI-906 and CI-907, new orally active nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, were examined for antihypertensive effects in unanesthetized hypertensive rats and dogs. In two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats, single oral daily doses (0.03-30 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure; a single 3 mg/kg oral dose lowered blood pressure to normotensive levels. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, 30 mg/(kg X day) orally administered for 5 consecutive days achieved the same blood pressure decrease as that obtained on the first day in the renal hypertensive rats. In diuretic-pretreated renal hypertensive dogs, a 10 mg/kg oral dose decreased blood pressure by 25%. No adverse side effects were observed with CI-906 and CI-907 in any of the conscious animals. These studies indicate that CI-906 and CI-907 are potent, orally active antihypertensive agents without any apparent limiting side effects.", 
    "142": "CI-906, [3S-[2[R*(R*)]], 3R*]-2-[2-[[1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-amino]-1-oxopropyl] 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid, monohydrochloride, and CI-907, [2S-[1[R*(R*)]], 2 alpha, 3a beta, 7a 7a beta]-1-[2-[[1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]amino] 1-oxopropyl]octahydro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid, monohydrochloride, are two new nonsulfhydryl-type angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Monoester (prodrug) and diacid forms produced concentration-related ACE inhibition in guinea pig serum (IC50 for CI-906 = 8.3 X 10(-9) M, diacid = 2.8 X 10(-9) M; CI-907 = 1.0 X 10(-7) M, diacid = 2.6 X 10(-9) M). In isolated rabbit aortic rings and in in vivo rat and dog autonomic studies, both compounds were highly specific in suppressing the contractile or pressor responses to angiotensin I. In two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt (renin-dependent) hypertensive rats there was a good correlation between the inhibition of vascular converting enzyme and blood pressure lowering and a poor correlation between blood pressure lowering and plasma and brain converting enzyme inhibition. Cardiovascular, pulmonary, and central nervous system performance evaluations showed no side effects or gross toxicity. The preclinical profile shows CI-906 and CI-907 to be specific, potent, orally active ACE inhibitors. They are expected to have therapeutic utility in hypertension and in any other condition where converting enzyme inhibition would be useful.", 
    "143": "Pivalopril (RHC 3659-(S); (S)-N-cyclopentyl-N-(2-methyl-3-pivaloylthiopropionyl) glycine) is a new compound with a hindered sulfur group that has been compared to captopril for oral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in rats and dogs and antihypertensive activity in rats. In separate groups of conscious normotensive rats, pivalopril (0.03-1.0 mg/kg, orally [p.o.]) produced a dose-related antagonism of angiotensin I (AngI)-induced pressor effects. The ED50 for pivalopril and captopril was 0.1 mg/kg. In conscious normotensive dogs, pivalopril (incremental doses of 0.01-1.0 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a dose-related antagonism of AngI pressor effects. The ED50 was 0.17 mg/kg for pivalopril and 0.06 mg/kg for captopril. At equieffective doses the two compounds had similar durations of action. In sodium-deficient, conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), pivalopril (1-100 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a dose-related reduction in mean arterial pressure. The potency and duration were similar to those of captopril. In the sodium-replete SHR, 5 days of oral dosing with pivalopril, 100 mg/(kg . day), decreased mean arterial pressure more effectively than captopril, 100 mg/(kg . day). No tolerance developed to the antihypertensive effect of either drug. It is concluded that pivalopril is a potent, orally effective ACE inhibitor and antihypertensive agent.", 
    "144": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors favorably modify control mechanisms that are disturbed in hypertension and congestive heart failure, principally, but perhaps not exclusively, through reduction in angiotensin II levels. Pharmacodynamic actions are vasodilation, increased sodium excretion, and lowering of blood pressure. Investigations with captopril and enalapril in the treatment of hypertension indicate efficacies comparable to each other and to current step 1 and 2 agents. Enalapril is more potent than captopril and has a longer duration of action. The hemodynamic mechanism of action is reduction in peripheral vascular resistance. Addition of a diuretic potentiates blood pressure lowering and proportion of patients responding. When used in congestive heart failure, ACE inhibitors exert a balanced vasodilator effect on arterial and venous beds and do not induce tachycardia or fluid retention. Cardiac output is increased whereas systemic vascular resistance, central pressures, and systemic blood pressure are reduced acutely and chronically. Although captopril is associated with certain side effects, possibly resulting from the sulfhydryl group in its structure, this profile has not been encountered thus far in clinical investigations with enalapril. The effects of ACE inhibitors on the natural histories of hypertension (independent of blood pressure lowering) and congestive heart failure are yet to be determined.", 
    "145": "Reversal of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with medical therapy has been studied increasingly in patients with systemic hypertension. However, serial changes of LV function are not found during reversal of LV hypertrophy in hypertensive patients. Seven patients with LV hypertension were studied to evaluate serial changes of LV mass and function after the initiation of the new converting enzyme inhibitor MK-421. LV mass and function were determined serially at the end of a placebo period and at 5 days, 1 month, 3 months and 7 months after the initiation of MK-421, using both 2-dimensional (2-D) guided M-mode echocardiography and radionuclide techniques. All patients except 1 had LV hypertrophy and all had normal LV function (ejection fraction derived from gated blood pool method greater than 49%). There was an inverse relation between LV fractional shortening (percent FS) and end-systolic stress before medication (r = -0.81, p less than 0.05). LV mass decreased significantly at 3 months and at 7 months (-10%, p less than 0.05, and -12%, p less than 0.01, respectively) accompanied with persistent decrease of mean blood pressure, which occurred as early as 5 days after start of therapy (133 +/- 5 mm Hg at control, to 112 +/- 4 mm Hg at day 5). During reversal of LV hypertrophy, the inverse correlation between FS and end-systolic stress remained significant (r = -0.80 to -0.95, p less than 0.025 for all), with no difference from the placebo period and from this relation in the normal group. Moreover, percent FS, ejection fraction and stroke index remained unchanged. Thus, LV hypertrophy in patients with systemic hypertension can be reversed without deterioration of LV function. Moreover, overall LV function is likely to be determined by afterload even after reversal of LV hypertrophy.", 
    "146": "In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), after 1 day of dosing with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril or enalapril) plus a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), a synergistic antihypertensive effect was observed when a second dose of the combination or ACE inhibitor alone but not the diuretic alone was given the next day. Bilateral ureteral ligation did not prevent the synergism, which indicates that diuresis per se was not the mechanism. Vascular responses to various agonists did not differ in SHR given ACE inhibitor or ACE inhibitor plus diuretic. SHR given combination treatment had higher and more prolonged increases in plasma renin activity. Aprotinin or indomethacin did not alter the synergism, which suggests that endogenous kinins and prostaglandins did not play a role. These data suggest that the mechanism for the synergistic antihypertensive effect resulted from the combination treatment's shifting the blood pressure regulation system to be renin dependent and responding more to drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Evidence was presented that the RAS can be shifted rapidly to assume a greater role in blood pressure regulation in SHR as well as in normotensive and two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt renal hypertensive dogs by restricting sodium intake. The data may partly explain the various degrees of antihypertensive responsiveness of essential hypertensive patients to ACE inhibitors.", 
    "147": "A series of N-(P-substituted phosphinoyl)peptides were synthesized and their antihypertensive activities were tested in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Among them, N-(dibenzyloxyphosphinoyl)-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Pro-OH showed the most potent and long-lasting antihypertensive activity in SHR when administered orally. Although the inhibitory activity of this peptide against the angiotensin-converting enzyme was about one-hundredth of that of Captopril, the antihypertensive activity in SHR was significantly higher and longer-lasting than that of Enalapril which has been reported to be the most potent agent among similar converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "148": "Polypeptides are endogenous agents, involved in the regulation of many physiologic functions and the pathogenesis of several diseases. Polypeptide antagonists form a group of new chemical entities which may provide valid therapeutic agents. Some polypeptides (angiotensin, kinins) are released through the action of proteolytic enzymes (renin, kallikreins) and act as hormones or autacoids; others (substance P, neurotensin) are synthetized by nervous cells to serve as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. The main homeostatic role of the renin-angiotensin system is to uphold high systemic arterial blood pressure. Overproduction of renin and insufficient checking of renin secretion are among the most common causes of arterial hypertension. Several forms of arterial hypertension (neurovascular, idiopathic) benefit from a reduction in renin-angiotensin system activity. This is achieved either through decreasing renin secretion, by inhibiting conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, or through blocking the peripheral actions (at the receptor sites) of angiotensin II. Renin secretion is very significantly reduced by beta-blocking agents (propranolol); conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II is inhibited by teprotide, captopril and their derivatives; peripheral actions of angiotensin II are blocked by saralasin. Bradykinin and related agents produce vasodilation, increase vascular permeability and stimulate pain fibers. Kinins thus reproduce the cardinal features of inflammation and are held to be mediators of the inflammatory reaction. The substance P neuropeptide is found in the brain and bowel; it may act as a transmitter of the sensation of pain at the spinal cord and central nervous system sites. Among other effects outside of the brain, substance P is a potent vasodilator and inhibits renin secretion. Neurotensin is a neuropeptide which produces hypothermia, muscular relaxation and analgesia. Outside of the brain, this peptide is involved in the regulation of gastric secretion, intestinal motility and insulin and glucagon secretion. The vasoactive intestinal peptide, found in certain cholinergic nerve endings, is a large peptide which inhibits gastric secretion, intestinal motility and vascular tone.", 
    "149": "Samples of plasma from ten normotensive volunteers and ten hypertensive patients were assayed for plasma renin activity before and after the addition of either captopril or captopril and angiotensin II. The study was repeated after treating portions of the same specimens with trypsin, to activate the inactive renin component. The results indicate that inactive renin is not converted to the active form by captopril in vitro, nor does the addition of angiotensin II inactivate the active form. These data are consistent with the in vivo findings that changes in active and inactive renin occur independently under conditions of challenge by captopril or angiotensin II analogues.", 
    "150": "The renal extraction ratios of 131I-sodium iodohippurate (131I-Hippuran) and 125I-thalamate were greatly reduced on the affected side by 50 mg captopril in seven out of 14 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis. With long term captopril 150 mg daily the uptake of 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid by the affected kidney, which was determined by scintillation camera renography, became almost zero in these seven patients, indicating severe reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. Function of the affected kidney returned on discontinuing treatment. The reduced extraction of sodium iodohippurate probably reflected a shortened plasma transit time through the kidney due to intrarenal vasodilatation. The reduced extraction of thalamate reflected a low filtration fraction, suggesting that the vasodilatation was, at least in part, at the level of the postglomerular arterioles. Captopril had little effect on the contralateral kidney and on the kidneys of 17 patients with essential hypertension, and serum creatinine concentrations showed minor changes. Radioisotope renography should be performed after beginning captopril treatment in patients with renal artery stenosis. This is also recommended for patients given captopril as a third line drug when renal artery stenosis has not been excluded. Hypertension is these patients is often severe and difficult to control. Renal artery disease is not rare in this difficult group and finding seriously impaired renal function on one side during captopril treatment may be diagnostic.", 
    "151": "The effect of stress on NaCl intake was examined in mice given a choice of water and 1.5% NaCl to drink. Immobilization of mice for 15-min and 24-h food deprivation resulted in a 2.5- and 5-fold increases in NaCl intake, respectively, without affecting water intake. Naloxone treatment (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease in the stress-induced NaCl intake, as did captopril treatment (5, 10 and 50 mg/kg). Intraventricular injection of angiotensin II in mice resulted in an increase in 1.5% NaCl intake, which was blocked by naloxone. Morphine (10 mg/kg) increased the preference of mice for a normally aversive 3.0% NaCl solution, but not for preferred, less concentrated, solutions of NaCl. The results suggest that both endogenous opioids and angiotensin II contribute to stress-induced NaCl intake, and that endogenous opioids may also mediate the increase in NaCl intake, observed with angiotensin II.", 
    "152": "To ascertain whether infarction and noninfarction outcomes to rapid occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) are differentiated by alteration of the systolic blood pressure (BP), rats under the following conditions were tested: normal Wistar rats (NW) made acutely hypertensive with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt, spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP) receiving captopril antihypertensive medication for 7 weeks, and SHRSP with captopril withdrawn 2 weeks prior to the occlusion test. Eleven of 13 acutely DOCA-salt hypertensive NW were protected from infarction. Adequate collateral circulation was preserved in NW vessels initially formed under normotensive conditions but tested during acute DOCA-salt hypertension. Since all SHRSP tested had infarcts, SHRSP were more susceptible to infarction than NW made acutely DOCA-salt hypertensive. SHRSP with captopril medication withdrawn for 2 weeks had higher BP and larger infarcts than SHRSP maintained on the drug. Results suggest that the mechanism causing elevated BP or one secondary to it adversely alters the collateral supply in SHRSP. An increase in collateral vascular resistance initiated during anatomical development of the anastomoses very early in life may predispose SHRSP to infarct after rapid MCA occlusion later in life.", 
    "153": "Glucose loading is known to cause acute suppression of plasma aldosterone and stimulation of plasma renin activity. The relative contribution of variations in circulating angiotensin II to the regulation of aldosterone secretion following glucose loading was assessed in ten normal subjects. The effects of a standard oral glucose loading test (100 g) on plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, potassium, aldosterone, renin activity and cortisol were studied (a) under basal conditions, and (b) after inhibition of angiotensin II with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (50 mg t.i.d. during 3 days). Under basal conditions the acute increase in plasma glucose and insulin after glucose loading was accompanied by a significant decrease (P less than 0.01) in plasma cortisol and aldosterone and by a significant increase in plasma renin activity (P less than 0.01); plasma potassium was decreased slightly but not significantly. Following captopril treatment preloading plasma renin activity was increased significantly, most probably reflecting an effective reduction of angiotensin II. Glucose loading caused a similar suppression of plasma aldosterone, as observed under basal conditions. This observation suggests that renin activation does not substantially contribute to the acute regulation of plasma aldosterone after an oral glucose load.", 
    "154": "A sensitive, quantitative gas chromatographic-electron capture (GC-EC) method for the determination of captopril in blood and captopril and its disulfide metabolites (collectively) in plasma was developed. After addition of an internal standard and N-ethylmaleimide to the biological samples, excess N-ethylmaleimide and naturally occurring interfering substances were removed by extraction with benzene followed by acidification and extraction with hexane. The N-ethylmaleimide adducts of captopril and of the internal standard were then extracted with benzene and converted to their hexafluoroisopropyl esters. For the assay of captopril and its disulfide metabolites, tributylphosphine was used to reduce the disulfide metabolites to captopril prior to derivatization. The hexafluoroisopropyl esters of the N-ethylmaleimide adducts of captopril and of the internal standard, the 4-ethoxyproline analogue of captopril, were separated by GC on a column packed with 3% OV-101 on Chromosorb W-HP. The lower limits of sensitivity were 20 ng/mL for captopril in blood and 50 ng/mL for captopril and its disulfide metabolites in plasma. Linearity, precision, and accuracy were excellent. The method was validated by comparison of results obtained for total captopril in dog plasma by the GC-EC assay with results obtained by a published GC-MS method. The assay was applied to dog and human samples to explore its general utility.", 
    "155": "A thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase, optimally active at a neutral pH, was identified in human serum. The enzyme cleaves the synthetic substrate glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-2-naphthylamide at the Ala-Phe bond. Activity was determined by measuring the rate of formation of Phe-2-naphthylamide in a coupled enzyme assay in the presence of excess aminopeptidase M. 2-Naphthylamine released during the reaction was determined by a diazotization procedure. Enzyme activity is not affected by inhibitors of serine, thiol, or carboxyl proteases, but is sensitive to inhibition by metal chelators such as EDTA and o-phenanthroline. Dialysis against EDTA leads to loss of activity, which can be fully restored by zinc and cobalt ions. The serum enzyme closely resembles a membrane-bound metalloendopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) abundant in lung, spleen, and kidney in that both enzymes are inhibited by the same active-site-directed inhibitors. In addition, an antiserum obtained against the metalloendopeptidase from rabbit kidney shows strong cross-reactivity with the serum enzyme. Metalloendopeptidase activity was measured in 150 controls and in 95 patients with sarcoidosis; the two groups had significantly different enzyme activities (p less than 0.001). The mean enzyme activity in the sarcoidosis group was more than threefold higher than that of the control group. The mean enzyme activity for patients with active disease was more than double that of patients with inactive disease and more than four times that of controls (p less than 0.001). This is noteworthy because angiotensin converting enzyme, a zinc-dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase with a mechanism of action similar to that of the metalloendopeptidase, has also been reported to be increased in the serum of patients with active sarcoidosis. Enzyme activity in patients with active tuberculosis, primary pulmonary neoplasms, and idiopathic interstitial pulmonary fibrosis did not differ significantly from that of controls.", 
    "156": "A 50-year-old black female developed hepatic dysfunction secondary to captopril therapy, 25 mg tid for one month. Liver biopsy showed primarily cholestasis, with secondary hepatocellular elements. Symptoms consisted of jaundice, pruritus, anorexia and weight loss, hepatomegaly, and abdominal tenderness. Total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), reached highs of 506 mumol/L, 737 U/L, 319 U/L, and 100 U/L, respectively. Recovery was slow, but complete, after discontinuation of the drug.", 
    "157": "The converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril (25-50 mg orally every 6 h for 66 h) was used to dissociate the circulating levels of angiotensin II (ANG II) from changes in sodium balance in 11 patients with normal renin essential hypertension on 10 mmol of sodium/day intake. Pressor, renal vascular and adrenal responses to graded infusions of ANG II (0.3, 1 and 3 pmol kg-1 min-1) were measured before and after captopril administration. Systemic vascular responses were assessed by measuring diastolic blood pressure (DBP), renovascular responses by measuring p-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance and adrenal responses by measuring plasma aldosterone. After receiving captopril for 66 h the hypertensive subjects showed a significantly (P less than 0.004) enhanced blood pressure response to the infused ANG II but not to noradrenaline when compared with the response before captopril. ANG II (3 pmol kg-1 min-1) also produced a significantly (P less than 0.03) greater reduction in PAH clearance after (-194 +/- 40 ml/min) compared with before (-104 +/- 15 ml/min) captopril. These results suggest that the responsiveness to ANG II in these two target tissues is determined by the circulating ANG II level. In the adrenal gland the aldosterone responses to ANG II also were significantly greater after (P less than 0.01) than before captopril (increment at 3 pmol kg-1 min-1: 660 +/- 88 vs 381 +/- 94 pmol/l). These results are in distinct contrast with the responses previously reported for normotensive subjects and support the hypothesis that the regulation of aldosterone secretion is altered in subjects with essential hypertension.", 
    "158": "Degradation of tritiated [Leu5]enkephalin was studied in cultures of neuroblastoma cells (clone N1E-115). Incubation of cells in suspension revealed Tyr as the main tritiated metabolite; however, Tyr-Gly-Gly and Tyr-Gly were detectable as well. In a crude membrane preparation of the neuroblastoma cells the level of Tyr is reduced to 13% and that of Tyr-Gly to 10% of the initial value, whereas Tyr-Gly-Gly is increased to about 5 times the initial value. Of the degraded enkephalin, 66% was accounted for by the formation of Tyr, 30% by the formation of Tyr-Gly-Gly and 4% by the formation of Tyr-Gly. The production of Tyr was inhibited by bestatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidases, and that of Tyr-Gly-Gly by captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting-enzyme. The results prove the ability of neuroblastoma cells (N1E-115) to degrade enkephalin by aminopeptidase and the membrane-bound angiotensin-converting-enzyme.", 
    "159": "Azotemia produced by converting enzyme inhibition in renovascular hypertension was studied in six patients by measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). Patients with unilateral renovascular hypertension lowered GFR acutely to 40% of control values at 4 hours, but after 4 days it only returned to 75% of control even though ERPF exceeded control values. Calculated filtration fraction (GFR/ERPF) decreased from 0.31 to 0.19 in 4 hours (p less than 0.05) and remained at 0.20 after 4 days of treatment despite increases in GFR and ERPF. In bilateral renovascular hypertension, neither the decreased GFR nor lowered ERPF induced by enalapril showed any tendency to return toward normal with continued treatment. These data are consistent with selective glomerular efferent arteriolar dilation in response to enalapril and suggest that angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition interferes with the autoregulatory capacity of the kidney in the presence of severe renovascular hypertension.", 
    "160": "Various antihypertensive drugs have different effects on vasoactive mechanisms. In normotensive Wistar rats, we investigated the effects on plasma and tissue catecholamines of chronic treatment with two agents: MK-421, an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI), and hydralazine, a vascular smooth muscle relaxant. Both agents lowered blood pressure via arteriolar dilation, to the same final level. However, hydralazine stimulated the renin-angiotensin system and elevated the plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) levels, whereas MK-421 did not. In MK-421-treated animals, NE, E, and the ratio of E/NE were decreased in the brain stem, and this ratio was increased in the heart. In hydralazine-treated rats, the catecholamine levels were unchanged in the brain stem and heart. The turnover rate of NE was significantly reduced in the brain stem and heart of MK-421-treated rats, whereas, after hydralazine, the turnover rate in the heart was increased (decreasing the half-life of NE by about 50%), indicating increased sympathetic activity. Thus, elimination of angiotensin II (AII) by CEI is associated with decreased sympathetic activity in both the brain stem and heart, whereas an equipotent antihypertensive action by smooth muscle relaxation leads to stimulation of both the renin-angiotensin and the sympathetic systems. These differences are more readily apparent by measurement of catecholamine turnover rates in tissues than of catecholamine levels, and they may account for the different hemodynamic effects of the two agents, even though both drugs act through arteriolar dilation.", 
    "161": "To study the hypotensive mechanism of the new oral converting-enzyme inhibitor, MK-421, we evaluated the antihypertensive effect of MK-421 in rats with hypertension induced by chronic administration of norepinephrine (NE) or vasopressin and measured urinary kallikrein and kinin excretions as indices of the renal kallikrein-kinin system. When 6 mg/kg/day of MK-421 was administered simultaneously with 1.8 mg/kg/day of NE, the systolic blood pressure of conscious rats rose on Day 1 to only 122.6 +/- 3.4 mm Hg compared with the rise to 146.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg when NE alone was infused (p less than 0.001). Similarly, when the same dose of MK-421 was administered simultaneously with 7.2 U/kg/day of vasopressin, the systolic blood pressure of conscious rats rose on Day 1 to only 117.4 +/- 3.8 mm Hg compared with the rise to 141.6 +/- 3.4 mm Hg when vasopressin alone was infused (p less than 0.01). The antihypertensive effect of MK-421 was sustained for 6 days in rats infused with NE or vasopressin. Infusion of NE alone resulted in a small but significant increase in urinary kallikrein excretion and no change in urinary kinin excretion. The combined administration of NE with MK-421 induced additional increases in urinary kallikrein and kinin excretions. Vasopressin alone resulted in marked decreases in urinary kallikrein and kinin excretions. The combined administration of vasopressin with MK-421 induced no additional changes in urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion. These results indicate that the hypotensive effect of MK-421 may depend on a reduced sensitivity of the peripheral arteries to vasoconstrictor substances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "162": "The antihypertensive, hemodynamic, and humoral effects of the new converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril (MK-421) were assessed by sequential studies during 3 months of uninterrupted treatment (20 mg twice daily) in 10 hypertensive patients. Six achieved good blood pressure (mean arterial pressure) control with enalapril alone (from 126 +/- 7.0 mm Hg pretreatment to 105 +/- 1.6 mm Hg at 3 months, p less than 0.05). The other four required the addition of diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg orally twice daily) at different stages of follow-up, with resultant blood pressure control (128 +/- 9.6 mm Hg pretreatment to 113 +/- 1.9 mm Hg at 2 months after the addition of diuretics). Neither the acute nor long-term blood pressure response could be predicted from the pretreatment levels of plasma renin activity. The blood pressure reduction during enalapril therapy was characterized by a decrease in total peripheral resistance (53 +/- 2.5 U X M2 pretreatment to 38 +/- 3.0 U X M2 at 3 months, p less than 0.05) with no significant change in cardiac output or heart rate. This lack of reflex tachycardia could not be ascribed to baroceptor dysfunction since the response to head-up tilt (the increase in diastolic blood pressure, in heart rate, and in plasma catecholamines) was normal and not significantly different from pretreatment response. Average blood volume did not change (91% +/- 4.3% of normal in the pretreatment period to 93% +/- 2.9% after 3 months of therapy, p = NS) despite the significant lowering of arterial pressure with enalapril alone (n = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "163": "We have investigated the effects on water intake of subcutaneous (S.C.) injections of low (0.5 mg/kg) and high (100 mg/kg) doses of captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (CE). Low doses block the synthesis of angiotensin II only in the circulation whereas high doses block CE in both the blood and the brain. The low dose of captopril enhanced drinking in response to three hypotensive drugs, isoprenaline (0.1 mg/kg, S.C.), phentolamine (5 mg/kg, S.C.) and serotonin (2 mg/kg, S.C.), whereas the high dose of captopril abolished drinking in response to these stimuli. The low dose of captopril also enhanced drinking in response to histamine (0.25-5.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, I.P.), but in this case the high dose of captopril only partially reduced the drinking response. The low dose of captopril enhanced drinking after 24 h water deprivation but high doses had no significant effect on deprivation-induced thirst. Hypovolaemia was produced either by injecting polyethylene glycol (30% w/v, 10 ml/kg) S.C. or by replenishing the cellular deficit in water-deprived rats with 10 ml water (by gavage). The low dose of captopril enhanced the drinking response to hypovolaemia but the high dose had no significant effect. Neither the high nor the low dose of captopril significantly affected drinking in response to cellular dehydration caused by injecting 2 M-NaCl (2 ml) I.P. or by replenishing the extracellular deficit in water-deprived rats (10 ml balanced salt solution by gavage). Nephrectomy (but not ligation of the ureters) or injections of propranolol (5 mg/kg, S.C.) to prevent renin secretion prevented the enhancement of deprivation-or serotonin-induced thirst by the low dose of captopril. The low dose of captopril did not enhance drinking in response to I.V. injections of renin (1 Goldblatt unit), or intracerebroventricular (I.C.V.) injections of angiotensin I or II. The high dose of captopril blocked drinking in response to I.V. injections of renin or I.C.V. injections of angiotensin I but did not reduce drinking in response to angiotensin II, I.C.V. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that blocking CE only in the circulation enhances drinking in response to hypotension or hypovolaemia because angiotensin I, accumulating in high concentration in the blood, enters the brain and is converted intracerebrally to angiotensin II. These findings suggest that the enhancement of drinking caused by low doses of captopril s.c. is a sensitive indicator of whether the renin- angiotensin system participates at all in the regulatory response to a particular stimulus to drink.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "164": "The kinetics of captopril plasma levels and of the drug-induced plasma converting enzyme activity (PCEA), plasma renin activity (PRA) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) modifications were studied over 24 h after oral administration of captopril, 1 mg/kg, to ten hypertensive patients. Free unchanged captopril pharmacokinetic parameters were: t1/2, alpha: 0.45 +/- 0.06 h; tmax: 0.98 +/- 0.13 h; Cmax: 1.31 +/- 0.20 mg l-1; t1/2,z: 0.66 +/- 0.13 h; V: 0.614 +/- 0.104 1 kg-1 and CLtot: 0.690 +/- 0.082 l h-1 kg-1. At 6 h captopril was no longer detectable in plasma. The onset of PCEA inhibition and of DBP decrease closely followed the rise of captopril's plasma levels, while that of PRA increase was delayed. In contrast, while captopril rapidly disappeared from plasma, its biological and antihypertensive effects were long-lasting. The lack of correlation between the relative bioavailability of captopril and the induced reduction in DBP (evaluated by the corresponding AUCs) suggests that free unchanged captopril plasma monitoring is not an adequate indicator of hypertensive patients' potential responsiveness to captopril's blood pressure lowering effects.", 
    "165": "The immediate and long-term effects of enalapril (MK421) and its lysine analogue (MK521) in once-daily dosage, were compared in a study of 12 normal subjects. Both compounds lowered blood pressure equally throughout 24 h without causing tachycardia. The biochemical changes with MK521 were more sustained than with MK421, but this did not affect the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. Twenty-four hours after the previous dose, with both active drugs, plasma renin concentration was significantly higher on day 8 than on day 1, though angiotensin I did not increase in proportion; this probably reflects a fall in renin-substrate with prolonged converting enzyme inhibition. There was an early natriuresis with each compound but this effect was no longer apparent after 8 days of continuous therapy. Both MK421 and MK521 were well tolerated with no serious side effects.", 
    "166": "We have visualized angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, peptidylpeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) in rat brain by in vitro [3H]captopril autoradiography. [3H]Captopril binding to brain slices displays a high affinity (Kd = 1.8 X 10(-9) M) and a pharmacological profile similar to that of ACE activity. Very high densities of [3H]captopril binding were found in the choroid plexus and the subfornical organ. High densities were present in the caudate putamen and substantia nigra, zona reticulata. Moderate levels were found in the entopeduncular nucleus, globus pallidus, and median eminence of the hypothalamus. Lower levels were detectable in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, the medial habenula, the median preoptic area, and the locus coeruleus. Injection of ibotenic acid or colchicine into the caudate putamen decreased [3H]captopril-associated autoradiographic grains by 85% in the ipsilateral caudate putamen and by greater than 50% in the ipsilateral substantia nigra. Thus, ACE in the substantia nigra is located on presynaptic terminals of axons originating from the caudate putamen, and ACE in the caudate putamen is situated in neuronal perikarya or at the terminals of striatal interneurons. The lack of effect of similar injections into the substantia nigra confirmed that the caudate putamen injections did not cause trans-synaptic changes. The presence of [3H]captopril binding is consistent with an ACE-mediated production of angiotensin II in some brain regions. Although [3H]captopril autoradiography reveals ACE in a striatonigral pathway, there is no evidence for angiotensin II involvement in such a neuronal pathway.", 
    "167": "The efficacy of MK 421 and propranolol was compared in 48 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Each patient was randomly assigned to receive 1 of the drugs for 12 weeks. Additionally, a subgroup of 28 patients underwent studies of forearm arterial and venous circulation by means of pulsed Doppler and mercury-in-silastic plethysmography. Both drugs reduced supine and standing blood pressure (BP) (p less than 0.001). Propranolol reduced heart rate (p less than 0.001), while MK 421 did not change it. Brachial artery diameter, blood velocity and flow increased after MK 421 (p less than 0.001), but were not changed after propranolol therapy. Forearm vascular resistance decreased after MK 421 (p less than 0.001) and after propranolol (p less than 0.05). Forearm venous tone was unaffected on MK 421, but increased after propranolol (p less than 0.01). Thus, in moderate hypertension, 3 months of treatment with MK 421 or propranolol similarly decrease BP, but affect the forearm circulation differently: MK 421 dilates both the brachial artery and the arterioles of the forearm, but does not affect the venous vessels, and propranolol causes little arterial change but increases the forearm venous tone.", 
    "168": "Despite the similarities in their mechanism of action, the structural requirements for selective interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme or enkephalinase are different. Inhibitory potency of a series of new mercaptoalkanoyl amino acids were determined on pure angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) from porcine plasma and on neutral metalloendopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) purified from rat brain. This latter enzyme, first designated as enkephalinase, seems to be synaptically involved in the degradation of enkephalins. All tested compounds, whose design was based on the classical active-site model of metallopeptidases, are reversible and competitive inhibitors of both enzymes. Owing to the remarkable similarity in the general topology of metallopeptidases, the differences in optimal binding requirements to enkephalinase and angiotensin-converting enzyme were interpreted from crystallographic studies on related enzymes such as thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A. The large size of the S'1 subsite of enkephalinase allows efficient binding (Ki approximately equal to 2-30 nM) of aromatic and bulky hydrophobic residues such as a cyclohexyl ring. In contrast, a methyl group in position P'1 favors inhibitory potency against angiotensin-converting enzyme while a cyclohexyl ring leads to a complete loss of activity. This feature could mean that optimal binding of the Zn atom present in the catalytic site is a more stringent requirement in angiotensin-converting enzyme than in enkephalinase. An increase in the size of the P'2 component of thiol inhibitors potentiates the affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme without a significant change on enkephalinase. Finally, methylation of the ultimate amide bond of inhibitors produces a 30-fold decrease in potency towards enkephalinase but does not affect the binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme. These findings allow a rational design of selective inhibitors of enkephalinase, an essential prerequisite for their possible clinical use as new analgesic and psycho-active agents.", 
    "169": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in modulating the renal hemodynamic and functional responses to reductions of fetoplacental blood volume (8.8-35.5%) was studied in two groups of fetal lambs (less than 120 days and greater than 130 days gestation; term 145 days) during infusion of either captopril (experimental fetuses) or dextrose 5% in water (control fetuses). At high hemorrhage levels (level III), renal blood flow decreased and renal vascular resistance increased significantly in both groups of fetuses (less than 120 days and greater than 130 days), either treated or not treated with captopril. However, at low hemorrhage levels (levels I and II), and contrary to what was observed in young fetuses (less than 120 days), near-term fetuses (greater than 130 days) receiving captopril showed neither significant decreases in renal blood flow nor increases in renal vascular resistance, whereas untreated fetuses of the same gestational ages demonstrated significant decreases in renal blood flow and increases in renal vascular resistance. It was found in both less than 120 day and greater than 130 day fetuses that hemorrhage is associated with a decrease in urinary flow rate and free water clearance accompanied by an increase in urine osmolality and sodium reabsorption. It was shown that captopril does not modify this response. The present study also demonstrated that the blood pressure response to hemorrhage was characterized by a similar decrease in less than 120 day fetuses, whether treated or untreated with captopril. On the other hand, blood pressure did not change in control fetuses greater than 130 days, but decreased slightly in captopril-treated fetuses during hemorrhage. Taken together, the present results tend to suggest that the renin-angiotensin system may be an important modulator of the renal hemodynamic response to low level hemorrhage as fetuses approach term, and may be more important in controlling blood pressure in near-term than in young fetuses.", 
    "170": "Enalapril, a new oral angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor, was administered to nine patients with severe congestive heart failure. Short-term hemodynamic response was noted within 2 hr and persisted for up to 24 hr. At peak effect mean arterial pressure fell from 83.4 +/- 10(SD) to 72.1 +/- 16.2 mm Hg (p less than .01), right atrial pressure from 13.6 +/- 6.0 to 10.4 +/- 7.5 mm Hg (p less than .01), pulmonary arterial pressure from 38.9 +/- 4.8 to 31.9 +/- 4.8 mm Hg (p less than .01), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 28.2 +/- 3.5 to 22.1 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (p less than .01), and total pulmonary resistance from 875 +/- 304 to 697 +/- 291 dynes-sec-cm-5 (p less than .05). Cardiac index was not changed, but there was a significant redistribution of regional blood flow with an increase of renal blood flow after enalapril. Plasma renin activity rose significantly from 6.2 to 28.6 ng/ml/hr, whereas plasma norepinephrine did not change after enalapril. Seven patients were treated with enalapril for 4 weeks. Five patients reported symptomatic improvement. Five of six patients tested had an increase in both exercise time (NS) and maximum oxygen consumption (NS). Repeat hemodynamic evaluation in six patients after long-term enalapril therapy showed a persistent effect with significant reductions in right atrial pressure from 13.8 +/- 7.2 to 7.1 +/- 4.7 mm Hg and in mean arterial pressure from 82.5 +/- 10.4 to 76.6 +/- 5.3 mm Hg and a significant increase in cardiac index from 2.1 +/- 0.5 to 2.5 +/- 0.5 l/min/m2 (all p less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "171": "Rabbit aortic rings with either an intact endothelium or a disrupted endothelium were used to generate dose response curves to angiotensin I (AI) in the presence (ED50 = 3 X 10(-7) M) and absence (ED50 = 1.7 X 10(-8) M) of 10 micrograms/ml teprotide, a converting-enzyme inhibitor. Treatment with teprotide did not alter responses to angiotensin II (AII). Comparable dose-dependent responses were obtained with AII regardless of endothelial integrity. Contraction velocities in response to angiotensin I (10(-7) M) and AII (10(-7) M) were also measured. Angiotensin II produced a significantly greater contraction velocity (p less than 0.001) than that produced by AI. The amount of conversion to AII by both intact rabbit aortic rings and rings following removal of the endothelium was determined using 125I-AI and 125I-AII. Waters C18 SEP-PAK columns were used to separate AI and AII. During the first 3 to 4 minutes after the addition of AI, contraction velocity measurements and conversion were greater in intact rings than rings without endothelium. Conversion of AI to AII in endothelial-disrupted rings was the same as in intact rings by 5 minutes after the addition of AI. Conversion of AI to AII was inhibited by 30 micrograms/ml teprotide at all times measured, and there was no evidence of an alternate route of metabolism. Angiotensin I contraction velocity measurements after 10 micrograms/ml teprotide also demonstrated impaired efficiency of conversion of AI to AII. Thus, it was established that a lack of endothelium attenuated the rate of conversion of AI to AII initially, and formation of AII with or without endothelium was blocked by teprotide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "172": "We studied the effects of angiotensin I (AI), angiotensin II (AII), and bradykinin (BK) on systemic blood pressure and blood flow in the renal, mesenteric, coeliac, external iliac, and internal iliac vascular beds in the presence and absence of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. AI and AII caused dose-dependent pressor responses and blood flow reductions, and BK caused dose-related depressor responses and an increase in blood flow. The pressor response to AI was decreased and the depressor response to BK was potentiated by captopril. However, the effectiveness of captopril was greater when the peptides were injected intravenously than when they were injected intraaortically. The average conversion of AI to AII in the mesenteric, coeliac, external iliac, internal iliac, and renal vascular beds was 45.7, 31.6, 30.6, 28.0, and 8.9%, respectively. The dose ratio of equipotent BK-induced responses before and after captopril in the mesenteric, coeliac, external iliac, internal iliac, and renal vascular beds was 4.6, 3.5, 2.8, 2.5 and 1.4, respectively. This order was similar to that of the percentage conversion of AI to AII. These results suggest that the greatest proportion of angiotensin conversion and BK inactivation occurs in the pulmonary circulation and that the least proportion occurs in the kidney.", 
    "173": "The effects on blood pressure of an antiserum against pure human kidney renin were studied in conscious and anesthetized (pentobarbital, 24 mg X kg-1 i.p.) small new world monkeys (common marmosets). The antiserum inhibited the enzymatic activity of renin by 50% in a dilution of 1:45,000 in marmoset and 1:50,000 in human plasma. The antiserum (0.2 ml i.v.) decreased blood pressure in conscious marmosets on normal sodium intake by 15 +/- 5 (SD) mmHg and after salt depletion by 31 +/- 13 mmHg. A converting enzyme inhibitor (teprotide, 2 mg X kg-1 i.v.) induced a comparable fall in blood pressure: -16 +/- 10 and -30 +/- 10 mmHg, respectively. Similar effects were observed on blood pressure of anesthetized marmosets. The correlation between pretreatment plasma renin concentration and the maximum fall in blood pressure was significant and identical for the experiments with antiserum and teprotide. These results demonstrate that antisera against human renin can be used for the specific blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in primates. In normotensive marmosets the renin-angiotensin system participates in the maintenance of blood pressure, to a degree depending on the state of sodium balance.", 
    "174": "The hydrolysis of substance P is catalyzed by purified rabbit lung angiotensin-converting enzyme (peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1). The kcat/Km for the reaction at 37 degrees is 3.3 +/- 0.3 X 10(3) M-1 sec-1, which is 60 times less than that which has been reported for the hydrolysis of angiotensin I. The initial site of hydrolysis is the antipenultimate peptide bond, which generates the tripeptide amide (Gly-Leu-Met-NH2). This hydrolysis is inhibited by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril, MK-422, and EDTA, and is dependent on the concentration of chloride ion. Both captopril and MK-422 potentiate the substance P-induced stimulation of salivation in rats. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme may be one of the enzymes that degrade substance P in vivo.", 
    "175": "Subcellular fractions from rat anterior pituitary homogenates were obtained by differential and gradient centrifugation, identified with the help of marker enzymes and screened for peptidases capable of hydrolyzing gonadoliberin, thyroliberin, enkephalin and substance P. Since each neuropeptide is susceptible to cleavage by more than one enzyme, specific substrates or inhibitors have been used for the selective determination of the individual peptidasic activities. Among the various enzymes tested, the angiotensin-converting enzyme, the thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase ('enkephalinase'), a thyroliberin-degrading enzyme and some aminopeptidasic activities were found to be associated with the plasma membrane. Other aminopeptidases, a gonadoliberin-degrading and a substance-P-degrading enzyme are associated with the mitochondria and thus are most likely not involved in the biological inactivation of neuropeptides.", 
    "176": "The compounds N-[1 (S)-carboxy-5-amino-pentyl]-L-phenylalanylglycine and N-[1 (S)-carboxy-5-aminopentyl]-DL-alanyl-L-proline were synthesized and explored as potential ligands for the affinity chromatography of angiotensin converting enzyme (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, EC 3.4.15.1) (ACE), a membrane-bound zinc metalloprotease. The N-alkylated Ala-Pro derivative has an apparent Ki less than 1 nM (at pH 7.5, 0.50 M NaCl) while the Phe-Gly derivative is a much less potent competitive inhibitor with an apparent Ki = 0.20 microM under the same conditions and thus more suitable for use as an affinity ligand. Immobilization of these compounds via a 28-A spacer to agarose yields resins with binding capacities of greater than 7 mg of enzyme/mL of resin, while spacers of 22 A or less result in binding capacities at least 350 times smaller. Immobilized N-[1 (S)-carboxy-5-amino-pentyl]-L-Phe-Gly is superior to the Ala-Pro derivative because elution can be affected by raising the pH to 8.9 with 98% yields compared with only 20% from the latter. Thus, a three-step process involving detergent extraction, concentration by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and affinity chromatography on the resin-immobilized Phe-Gly derivative provides 30 mg of homogeneous ACE from 640 g of rabbit lung tissue. An ACE-like metalloprotease has also been isolated from testicular tissue by this same technique.", 
    "177": "In order to evaluate the effect of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on lipid metabolism, we measured serum lipoperoxides concentration ( LPX ) as well as plasma levels of renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PAC) and bradykinin ( PBK ) before and after captopril administration in 15 hypertensive patients. Captopril significantly lowered the LPX (p less than 0.05 by repeated measures ANOVA) from the control value of 3.25 +/- 1.16 (mean +/- S.D.) to 2.92 +/- 0.94, 2.83 +/- 1.10, and 2.89 +/- 1.31 nmol/ml 30, 60, and 120 min after the administration, respectively. A significant reduction of blood pressure (p less than 0.0001) and PAC (p less than 0.01) was observed following captopril administration, while PBK increased significantly (p less than 0.001) from a baseline level of 10.85 +/- 4.07 to 13.95 +/- 5.29, 16.25 +/- 6.85, and 15.71 +/- 7.65 pg/ml 30, 60, and 120 min after captopril administration, respectively. There was no significant correlation between changes in serum LPX and in mean blood pressure, PRA and PAC, though a significant inverse relationship was found between changes in serum LPX and in PBK 120 min after the administration (r = -0.576, p less than 0.05, n = 13). Although the mechanisms by which serum LPX is decreased by captopril are not clear, it is suggested from the results that captopril is a beneficial antihypertensive agent for preventing LPX -induced atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients.", 
    "178": "At a two years' interval, a patient with severe hypertension was treated with captopril and MK 521, two different angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Each time the blood pressure decreased to normal levels after addition of diuretic therapy but the patient developed acute renal failure. On both occasions the interruption of the inhibitors restored renal function very rapidly. In this woman, considered to suffer from essential hypertension on the basis of a normal intravenous pyelogram, arteriography showed bilateral renal-artery stenosis.",

Sixty min later, morphine sulfate, 5 mg/kg, or saline was injected subcutaneously. Response to a thermal stimulus was monitored before and up to 5 h ter morphine injection using the rat tail flick test. Serum ACE activity was greater than 90% inhibited by enalapril throughout the experiment. Enalapril did not exhibit analgesic activity nor did it potentiate morphine analgesia.", 
    "180": "Peptide hormones are known to bind to cell surface receptors as the first step in the generation of their effects on target tissues. However, it remains uncertain whether internalized hormone might also play a role in the production of longterm or trophic effects of peptide hormones. Because the peptide hormone angiotensin II appears to be internalized by target cells, we studied the effect of this peptide on isolated hepatic nuclei. At both 5 X 10(-7)M and 5 X 10(-9)M, angiotensin II significantly increased RNA synthesis. This effect was not mimicked by Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II (saralasin) or the unrelated nonapeptide teprotide.", 
    "181": "The effects of angiotensins on the motility of highly washed human sperm were examined by multiple exposure photography system. The addition of low doses (0.1-10 ng/ml) of angiotensin II (AT II) stimulated the forward velocity of sperm without increasing the percentage of motility. On the contrary, high concentration (1.0 micrograms/ml) of AT II suppressed the motility. The direct effect of angiotensin I (AT I) on the motility was observed under the presence of SQ 14225, a specific inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). At I (0.1-100 ng/ml) gave no influence on the motility, whereas that of high dose (1.0 ug/ml) suppressed the motility in the same manner as the corresponding dose of AT II. The action of AT II on the motility was completely suppressed under the coexistence of saralasin, a specific antagonist against AT II. This fact indicated that the action of AT II on the sperm appeared through the specific receptor on sperm.", 
    "182": "Rats were treated with a single injection of either capsaicin (50 mg kg-1 s.c.) or vehicle on day 2 after birth. When the animals were adult, they were challenged with osmotic (water deprivation) and haemodynamic (acute hypotension) stimuli that normally evoke vasopressin release. Capsaicin-treated and vehicle-injected rats showed similar body weight losses and plasma osmolalities following 48 h of water deprivation. Thus it appears that neonatal treatment with capsaicin does not impair the antidiuretic response to plasma hyperosmolality. Following acute ganglion blockade in the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, there was some recovery of blood pressure in the vehicle-injected rats, but recovery was significantly (P less than 0.001) less in the capsaicin-treated animals. The recovery may be attributed to vasopressin since it was abolished by an antagonist selective for the pressor action of the peptide (d(CH2)5DAVP). These results suggest that neonatal treatment with capsaicin impairs vasopressin-mediated recovery of blood pressure following acute hypotension. The possible involvement of baro- or chemoreceptor afferents is discussed.", 
    "183": "This article demonstrates conclusively that systemic vasodilator therapy is an important new medical treatment for acute and chronic heart failure. Initially, vasodilators were used only when digitalis and diuretics could not adequately treat congestive heart failure. Now many clinicians view the vasodilators as equal or even better alternatives than digitalis and diuretics. There is no doubt that vasodilator therapy is one of the major advances in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "184": "Captopril is an orally active converting enzyme inhibitor lowering blood pressure (BP) in different types of hypertension. A combination of captopril and a diuretic is often used in the treatment of severe hypertension. We have examined the chronic haemodynamic effect of combined captopril and hydrochlorothiazide treatment at rest and during 50 and 100 W dynamic exercise in 12 patients with severe therapy resistant essential hypertension. Blood pressure was measured intra-arterially before and after a mean treatment period of 8.7 months. Cardiac index (CI) was measured by dye dilution (Cardiogreen) and body fluid volumes by radioisotope dilution techniques. During rest sitting BP was reduced by 31/17 mmHg (15%) from a pretreatment value of 205/119 mmHg. Total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) fell 17% whereas CI, heart rate (HR) and stroke index (SI) did not show any significant changes. The fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was slightly less during exercise (12%) and the BP reduction was associated with a fall in CI and SI of 15 and 17%, respectively and no fall in TPRI. No significant changes were observed in body fluid volumes.", 
    "185": "Eight hypertensive renal allograft recipients who had received captopril are presented. Captopril in a maximal daily dose of 250 mg enabled the withdrawal of large doses of beta-blocking agents and vasodilators. Blood pressure was satisfactorily controlled in all except one. No adverse side effects were observed other than the 'first dose' effect which resulted in transient anuria in one patient. Captopril appears to be a useful agent in the management of severe hypertension after renal transplantation.", 
    "186": "Effect on different tissues with regard to angiotensin converting enzyme during captopril treatment in the rat was studied. Male Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 9) were treated during four weeks with captopril dissolved into the drinking water at the dose 30 mg/kg/day. Control rats (n = 9) had water only. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity increased three-fold during captopril treatment, and ACE of purified pulmonary plasma membranes increased about 64% (P less than 0.001) compared to untreated rats. ACE activity of membrane fractions of other tissues studied i.e. testicles, epididymes, kidneys, and small intestine brush border did not increase similarly during captopril treatment. The highest amounts of ACE was demonstrated in epididymes, but captopril did not produce increased amounts of ACE in the epididymes. The main source of increased serum ACE activity during captopril treatment appeared to be in the pulmonary tissue.", 
    "187": "Electroacupuncture (EA), a form of transcutaneous electrical stimulation, produces opiate-like antinociception and catalepsy in rats. This effect of EA cannot be produced in hypophysectomised rats, whereas adrenalectomised rats show increased sensitivity. In intact rats, adrenocorticotrophic hormone and dexamethasone have been found to be effective to sensitise the animals to the analgesic effect of EA. Deoxycorticosterone, on the contrary, attenuates this effect. Spironolactone is also effective to potentiate EA response, which is accompanied with severe respiratory depression. Drugs that are known to affect adrenal aldosterone secretion also modulate the effect of EA. Naloxone administration, 15 min prior to the initiation of EA stimulation, potentiates the effect of EA, whereas it counteracts the effect of EA if administered after initiation of EA stimulation. Moreover, this counteracting ability of naloxone increases with the increase in time interval between initiation of stimulation and naloxone challenge. Pretreatment with drugs that impair adrenal mineralocorticoid response to physiological stimuli inhibits the counteracting effect of naloxone. On the contrary, mineralocorticoid supplemented rats show greater sensitivity to naloxone counteraction.", 
    "188": "Three structurally different drugs, MK421, SA446 and captopril, are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. They induced a significantly greater fall in systolic blood pressure in sodium depleted rats than in sodium repleted ones. The combined administration of vasopressin or norepinephrine with MK421 eliminated the hypertensive effect of vasopressin or norepinephrine. Urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion were increased by MK421, SA446 or captopril in the sodium depleted rats whereas any significant changes in them were not observed in the sodium repleted rats. The combined administration of norepinephrine with MK421 induced further increases in urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion when compared to rats infused with norepinephrine alone, whereas the combined administration of vasopressin with MK421 did not induce any changes in them when compared to rats infused with vasopressin alone. Chronic infusion of captopril for up to 6 days in the rats induced a reduction of the vascular response to exogenous bradykinin; the blood pressure fall was less than that of the controls by 17% on Day 2 and by 18% on Day 6. These results indicate that the hypotensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was in part associated with the enhanced renal and vascular smooth muscle kallikrein-kinin system.", 
    "189": "The effect of captopril on blood pressure (BP) and various components of the renin-angiotensin system was assessed in ten severely hypertensive patients. Captopril acutely reduced the BP with a maximum decrease of 23% at 90-120 min. Maintenance treatment with captopril alone could not control the BP in any of the patients. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide markedly reduced the BP, while supplementation with propranolol caused no consistent changes. Three patients attained a supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) less than or equal to 90 mmHg. Only two patients had a fall in SDBP less than 10 mmHg. One patient stopped because of taste disturbances. Monitoring the renin-angiotensin system showed suppressed plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and increased levels of angiotensin I and renin, indicating the inhibition of converting enzyme activity. Plasma concentration of renin substrate decreased significantly. This observation has important implications for the methodology of renin assays. Captopril is an effective alternative in the treatment of hypertensive patients not readily controlled with conventional therapy.", 
    "190": "The effects of high plasma renin levels on plasma levels of both total immunoreactive angiotensinogen (direct radioimmunoassay) and intact angiotensinogen measured by angiotensin I released by renin (indirect assay) were studied in sodium-depleted rats both with and without captopril treatment and in adrenalectomized rats. The direct assay measures both intact angiotensinogen and des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen, its residue cleaved by renin. The indirect assay measures only intact angiotensinogen. Neither sodium depletion, captopril treatment, nor adrenalectomy modified the circulating levels of total angiotensinogen. However these treatments produced a decrease in intact angiotensinogen that was in proportion to the elevation of renin levels. The difference between the two assays for angiotensin represents the level of des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen and correlated satisfactorily with the plasma levels of renin. Identical correlations were observed in adrenalectomized rats and captopril-treated rats. We conclude that des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen levels are an index of activation of the renin-angiotensin system dependent on the circulating level of renin.", 
    "191": "Hormonal factors may be important in the regulation of peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) in congestive heart failure (CHF). The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of CHF was studied in 16 unanesthetized dogs. CHF was induced by rapid right ventricular pacing, with and without chronic converting-enzyme inhibition (CEI) by captopril. The hemodynamic changes and the activity of renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine and vasopressin were studied. The control dogs showed a greater decrease in cardiac output and a greater increase of mean pulmonary artery pressure than the captopril-treated group. In the group with CEI, only a small, transient increase in PVR was observed during the development of CHF; in the control group, there was an increase of 94% of basal values. The control group showed a continual increase of renin, aldosterone and norepinephrine. Four control dogs showed an inappropriately high secretion of arginine vasopressin. The increase of sympathetic nervous activity was only insignificantly attenuated by angiotensin II inhibition and was without a considerable influence on PVR except for an early transient increase in vascular tone. In our animal model, the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of PVR in CHF. In this kind of CHF the sympathetic nervous system appears to be of minor importance for the long-term regulation of PVR. Plasma arginine vasopressin levels were increased in control dogs; this increase may contribute to the increased vascular tone.", 
    "192": "Enalapril, a potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, effectively blocked the constrictor actions of angiotensin I in isolated perfused cat coronary arteries. Enalapril, at concentrations of 25 to 100 micrograms/ml, inhibited angiotensin I by 65 to 80%. Moreover, enalapril at 100 to 200 micrograms/ml, markedly antagonized the coronary vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II. At 150 micrograms/ml, enalapril blocked the angiotensin II response by 80 +/- 5%, and at 200 micrograms/ml, it was blocked by 95 +/- 4%. Enalaprilic acid at 0.5 to 1.0 microgram/ml also blocked the angiotensin II response by 94 +/- 5%. Captopril, up to 250 micrograms/ml, failed to significantly antagonize angiotensin II, although it readily blocked angiotensin I in this preparation. The duration of this angiotensin II blockade lasted about 60-90 min. This angiotensin II antagonism may help explain the beneficial effects of enalapril in situations such as acute myocardial ischemia.", 
    "193": "CI-907 is a new orally active nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Monoester (prodrug) and diacid forms produced concentration related ACE inhibition in guinea-pig serum (IC50 for monoester, 1.7 X 10(-7) M and for diacid, 2.6 X 10(-9) M). In isolated rabbit aortic rings and in rat and dog autonomic studies, CI-907 is highly specific in suppressing the contractile or pressor responses to angiotensin I. In two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats, single daily doses (0.03-30 mg/kg p.o.) produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure; 3 mg/kg lowered blood pressure to normotensive levels. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat, subacute administration of CI-907 (30 mg/kg/day for 5 days) produced the same decrease in blood pressure as that obtained in the renal hypertensive rat. In diuretic-pretreated renal hypertensive dogs, 10 mg/kg normalized blood pressure. For equivalent drops in blood pressure, heart rate increases were less in CI-907 than in enalapril-treated renal hypertensive dogs. No side effects were observed with CI-907 in any of the conscious animals. The antihypertensive response to CI-907 (0.03-1.0 mg/kg p.o.) was found to correlate with inhibition of vascular tissue ACE, but not plasma or brain ACE in two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats. These studies indicate that CI-907 is a potent antihypertensive agent with a heart rate profile different from enalapril.", 
    "194": "Current radioimmunoassays do not demonstrate total absence of angiotensin II during converting enzyme inhibition. To assess the meaning of plasma angiotensin II determinations during converting enzyme inhibition, plasma angiotensin I and II levels of normotensive humans during maximal converting enzyme inhibition by single oral doses of CGS 13945, MK 421, or MK 521 were compared with those of anephric rats (18 hr after nephrectomy) after intravenous administration of MK 422 (1 mg/kg). Prior to radioimmunoassay, plasma was extracted with Dowex for angiotensin II and blood extracted with ethanol for angiotensin I. During converting enzyme inhibition, in the 20 normotensive subjects plasma angiotensin II was 6.3 +/- 2.3 pg/ml (mean +/- S.D.) and blood angiotensin I was 65 +/- 59 pg/ml. In the nephrectomized rats, plasma angiotensin II was 8.9 +/- 2.3 pg/ml without converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 15) and 7.6 +/- 2.8 with MK 422 (n = 14), and blood angiotensin I was 9.8 +/- 2.4 pg/ml and 8.2 +/- 0.7, respectively. Dowex extraction of Tris buffer containing no angiotensin II provided blank values ranging from 5.0 to 7.8 pg/ml (n = 5). Thus plasma angiotensin II of normotensive humans treated with converting enzyme inhibitors fell to blank levels even in the presence of markedly elevated plasma angiotensin I. Angiotensin II concentrations in anephric rats with or without converting enzyme inhibition were the same. We therefore conclude that plasma levels of angiotensin II below 8 pg/ml measured after Dowex extraction probably reflect complete converting enzyme inhibition and virtual absence of angiotensin II generation.", 
    "195": "Our previous studies, in vivo and in vitro, have shown reduced inotropic responsiveness to isoproterenol of hypertrophied hearts in renovascular hypertensive rats. In the present study, we have investigated, in the same model, the effects of treatment either by nephrectomy or captopril on the inotropic responsiveness to isoproterenol and on the number and affinity of ventricular beta-receptors. Isoproterenol infusion of isolated hearts from renovascular hypertensive rats 12-18 weeks post-clipping produced lower inotropic responses (delta peak dP/dt) than age-matched sham-operated normotensive rats (P less than 0.001). Quantitative assessment of beta-adrenergic receptors in the same hearts showed a significant decrease in renovascular hypertensive rats ventricular receptor numbers, whether calculated per milligram membrane protein (22.3 +/- 2.66 fmol/mg vs. 37.9 +/- 4.34, P less than 0.005) or per gram wet ventricular weight (1.43 +/- 0.14 pmol/g vs. 2.2 +/- 0.21, P less than 0.005), with no significant change in Kd. Control of hypertension by either nephrectomy or captopril led to regression of hypertrophy 6 weeks after stabilization of blood pressure (12-18 weeks post-clipping) and returned both the ventricular receptor density and inotropic responsiveness toward normal. The improvement in inotropic responsiveness to isoproterenol in regressed hearts correlated with both the reduction in ventricular weight and the decrease of blood pressure. Regression of hypertrophy did not alter the relationship between inotropic response, receptor density, and ventricular weight. These results indicate that the increase in cardiac mass associated with renovascular hypertension may interfere with adrenergic support to the heart, and that proper control of hypertension and regression of hypertrophy could reverse that impairment and restore its responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "196": "Hypertension in periarteritis nodosa poses the problem of aetiology, prognostic significance and treatment. Thirty seven cases of periarteritis noda with hypertension were analysed with \u00e0 follow-up of over 10 years. These cases were taken from a series of 91 patients with polyarteritis nodosa admitted to the Department of Internal Medecine at the Piti\u00e9 Hospital, between 1960 and 1980. Hypertension was observed on admission in 40% of the patients and developed during the first year of the disease in another 40%. The prognosis of patients with polyarteritis nodosa and hypertension is not significantly different from those without hypertension during the first six years. The overall prognosis depends mainly on the degree of renal involvement. The hypertension is renovascular in a number of cases due to ischaemia of the renal cortex. This was demonstrated by renal arteriography or by evaluating plasma renin activity in the renal veins. In some cases, especially those in which the hypertension preceded the periarteritis nodosa, the hypertension seemed to progress independently. In some cases, however, it was not possible to determine the relationship between the periarteritis nodosa and the hypertension or confirm that this association was coincidental. The use of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors is an important advance in the treatment of the hypertension of periarteritis nodosa with high plasma renin activity as it counteracts the exact mechanism of the hypertension. Their use is justified in high plasma renin activity hypertension of periarteritis nodosa; patients who fail to respond may be treated with betablockers or other antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "197": "Two proteolytic activities that degrade [Leu5]enkephalin were found in Torpedo californica electric organ. One is a soluble aminopeptidase that degrades enkephalin at the Tyr1-Gly2 peptide bond, and the second is an endopeptidase that degrades enkephalin at the Gly3-Phe4 peptide bond. The aminopeptidase is inhibited by low concentrations of puromycin and bestatin. More than 60% of the endopeptidase is associated with the particulate fraction and is almost completely inhibited by low concentrations of captopril (SQ 14225) or SQ 20881 (potent inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme). Thiorphan and phosphoramidon (potent enkephalinase inhibitors) are much less effective. The pattern of cleavage and inhibition of the particulate endopeptidase thus resembles that of angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "198": "A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method is described for the simultaneous measurement of the novel anti-hypertensive drug captopril, and the following metabolites: captopril disulfide dimer, S-methyl captopril, and S-methyl captopril sulfone. With this method all derivatives can be chromatographed using conventional gas chromatography of hexafluoroisopropyl esters in one temperature-programmed run and these can then be quantitated using selected-ion monitoring techniques. Using urine or plasma, captopril, S-methyl captopril and the disulfide dimer of captopril in concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml and 25 ng/ml, respectively can be detected. The reproducibility of the method is satisfactory both within-assay and inter-assay. This technique has demonstrated that the pattern of urinary excretion of these compounds in both man and rat was similar. Excretion of unchanged captopril, S-methyl captopril and the disulfide dimer over 6 h in man given captopril (50 or 100 mg) chronically was 18.3%, 0.97% and 3.06%, respectively. Corresponding excretion of these three compounds in the rat following a single 10 mg/kg dose was 18.3%, 2.69% and 1.8%, respectively. A possible sulfone oxidation product of S-methyl captopril was not detected in the urine of either man or rat.", 
    "199": "Using an earlier model of the favoured orientation of binding functions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, it has been possible to postulate a new, 7,6-bicyclic system, based on hexahydropyridazine, which might be expected to have high potency. Some members of this system which have been synthesised have been shown to be very active ACE inhibitors, in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "200": "Captopril was administered (1 mg/kg of body weight) to 37 unselected hypertensive patients undergoing bilateral renal vein catheterization to determine its safety and efficacy in diagnosing hypertension related to unilateral renal artery lesions. In the 18 patients who had a unilateral renal artery lesion demonstrated by angiography, the ratio of plasma renin activity of the involved to uninvolved renal vein rose significantly after administration of captopril, whether or not patients were taking antihypertensive medication. This postcaptopril ratio differentiated cases of unilateral lesions from cases of bilateral lesions or absence of lesions without any overlap. The test was well tolerated despite occasional large drops in blood pressure. These data show that converting enzyme inhibition increases the diagnostic accuracy of renal vein catheterization by increasing the difference between the amount of plasma renin secreted by the two kidneys in cases of unilateral renal artery lesions.", 
    "201": "In this case we are reporting on a patient suffering from malignant renovascular hypertension and chronic renal failure due to occlusion of both renal arteries. The acute renal insufficiency after Captopril and later on after Enalapril treatment was fully reversible. We believe that the acute reversible renal insufficiency was caused by the blockage of glomerular autoregulation depending on Angiotensin II.", 
    "202": "A HPLC method has been developed for the determination of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in dog plasma. The plasma was deproteinized with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) containing N-(3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid SQ 25,233 as an internal standard, adjusted to pH 9.5 with borate buffer containing tri-n-butyl phosphine (TBP) to reduce the oxidized captopril, and treated with a thiol specific reagent, SBD-F. The fluorescent derivatives of captopril and the internal standard were separated from other interfering peaks on a reversed-phase column and determined by HPLC. The proposed method was simple, selective and sensitive. The total plasma concentration of captopril reached a maximum of 3.04 +/- 0.54 microg/ml (mean +/- S.E.) 60 min after administration of the drug.", 
    "203": "We have studied the mechanisms contributing to the characteristic cardiovascular response produced after lesions of the A1 noradrenaline cell area in the ventrolateral medulla of the rabbit, at and below the level of the obex. Forty-five minutes after the A1 lesions there were dramatic increases in plasma adrenaline and plasma vasopressin (AVP) levels, which rose more than forty-fold, accompanied by smaller increases in plasma noradrenaline concentration and plasma renin activity (PRA) which were approximately doubled. Administration of an AVP antagonist did not effect the pressor response to A1 lesions but did reduce the bradycardia whereas administration of phentolamine, an alpha adrenoceptor blocker, completely prevented the increase in blood pressure after lesions. Administration of propranolol and methylscopolamine together, reduced the magnitude of the bradycardia by blocking cardiac efferent mechanisms mediating baroreceptor reflexes, but left a persistent residual fall in heart rate which was independent of baroreflexes; on the other hand when the AVP antagonist was given simultaneously with propranolol and methylscopolamine the bradycardia was completely abolished. Furthermore, infusion of AVP producing plasma levels similar to those seen after A1 lesions, caused a fall in heart rate and cardiac output with only a minor degree of vasoconstriction and no change in mean arterial pressure. An inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme had no effect on either heart rate or blood pressure. The rise in blood pressure observed after lesions of the A1 noradrenaline cell region is principally due to activation of the sympatho-adrenal system. The bradycardia is partly reflex due to stimulation of arterial baroreceptors. There is a marked rise in plasma AVP which exerts a minor vasoconstrictor effect but contributes directly and more substantially to the fall in heart rate.", 
    "204": "A sensitive method has been developed for the determination of a new antihypertensive agent, (2R,4R)-2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(3-mercaptopropionyl)-4-thiazolidinecar boxylic acid (I), in human blood. Because the drug is unstable in biological fluids, it was immediately derivatized by treating the freshly drawn blood specimens with N-(4-anilinophenyl)maleimide. The adduct was separated and determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection on a reverse-phase column. The assay method was satisfactory with respect to the sensitivity and precision, providing a quantitation limit of 2 ng/ml and coefficient of variation of 3%. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data were obtained by orally administering I to two patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "205": "Several enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, receptors and transport structures are situated on the luminal surface of endothelium. Some enzymes and transport systems are continuously active and, in effect, regulate the composition of blood moving downstream. Other components are latent. Their activities are not expressed in the absence of stimulus. Thus, endothelial cells injured by granulocytes or viral infection possess receptors for the Fc segment of IgG and for C3b, whereas normal endothelial cells do not. Both normal and injured endothelial cells express receptors for Clq. To visualize surface enzymes, inhibitors, receptors and transport structures, we have prepared surface replicas suitable for high resolution EM. The surface replication technique, coupled with immunocytochemical procedures, facilitates studies of the topographies of surface enzymes such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and carboxypeptidase N (CPN). In addition, the replicas provide unique views of the glycocalyx, a cell coating previously believed to be amorphous but now seen to be a highly organized carpet-work under which surface enzymes, receptors, etc are embedded. Given its content of fibronectin, the glycocalyx may be the Clq receptor. Cells treated with antibodies to ACE or CPN show disarrayed glycocalyces and bind Fc and C3b. Latency of the Fc and C3b receptors may be owing to the physical barrier provided by the glycocalyx. Apparently, damage to the glycocalyx creates conditions favoring binding of immune complexes, complement activation and intravascular coagulation with loss of gradients between blood and parenchyma. Whether some non-thrombogenic properties of endothelium require an intact glycocalyx deserves consideration as does the role of the glycocalyx in regulating microvascular permeability.", 
    "206": "By inhibiting ACE, captopril blocks the conversion of AI or AII and augments the effects of bradykinin both in vitro and in vivo. In rats, dogs, and monkeys with 2-kidney renal hypertension, orally administered captopril rapidly and markedly reduces blood pressure; this antihypertensive effect apparently occurs via a renin-dependent mechanism; that is, the inhibition of ACE. In 1-kidney renal hypertension studies in rats and dogs, it was determined that oral doses of captopril markedly lowered blood pressure, but only after several days of dosing; the mechanism is thought to be non-renin dependent. In SHR, daily oral doses of captopril progressively lowered blood pressure; normal levels were attained by the sixth month. In all species studied, the reduction in blood pressure resulted from a reduction in total peripheral resistance; cardiac output remained unchanged or increased. In humans, captopril reduces blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension with low, normal, and high renin levels, and in patients with renovascular hypertension and hypertension associated with chronic renal failure. In hypertensive patients with high plasma renin activity, captopril apparently exerts most of its pharmacologic effects through inhibition of ACE. The means by which captopril reduces high blood pressure associated with low or normal PRA is not known, but it is clear that captopril does not act on an overactive plasma renin-angiotensin system in these cases. The antihypertensive effect of captopril is enhanced when it is given in combination with a diuretic or after salt depletion. Captopril was rapidly and well absorbed in all species tested, including man. Studies in rodents indicated that ingestion of food caused a reduction in the extent of absorption and bioavailability of captopril. Captopril and/or its metabolites were distributed extensively and rapidly throughout most tissues of normal rats; no radioactivity was detected in the brain. In vitro and in vivo, captopril formed disulfide bonds with albumin and other proteins. This binding was reversible in nature. In vitro studies in blood indicates that the disulfide dimer of captopril and mixed disulfides of captopril with L-cysteine and glutathione were formed. In intact blood cells, captopril remained in the reduced form (sulfhydryl), whereas in whole blood or plasma, captopril was converted to its disulfide dimer and other oxidative products. Biotransformation of captopril may involve both enzymatic and nonenzymatic processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "207": "Three patients with Bartter's syndrome were studied under metabolic ward conditions. Renal function and the reninangiotensin system were evaluated in three different settings: before and during captopril treatment and during administration of captopril and indomethacin. Captopril induced renal vasodilation with an increase in renal plasma flow by 23%. The addition of indomethacin abolished this change. Captopril increased the release of renin and the concentration of angiotensin II in plasma decreased without being completely normalized. Indomethacin thereafter reduced plasma concentration of renin, which was, however, still higher than the control level. The plasma concentration of angiotensin II did not change significantly. In conclusion, prostaglandin synthetase inhibition annihilated the effect of captopril on renal hemodynamics and renin release.", 
    "208": "The effects of prostaglandin synthetase inhibition by indomethacin on blood pressure and hormonal variations induced by captopril were studied in eight patients with essential hypertension and in six nonhypertensive subjects. Captopril antihypertensive effect and captopril-induced plasma renin increase were almost totally abolished by a short-term administration of indomethacin (50 mg t.i.d.). These results support the hypothesis that prostaglandins contribute to the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors. It may be of clinical importance that anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit PG-synthetase can also blunt the antihypertensive action of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "209": "The effect of captopril up to 450 mg/day on blood pressure and renal function were investigated during sustained treatment of 10 patients whose severe hypertension had not responded to previous therapy. All the patients were kept on diuretics and most of them on beta-blockers, too. A control determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and para-aminohippuric acid clearance (CPAH) was performed during the prior treatment. The effect of the addition (or substitution) of captopril were assessed after an average of 25 days (short-term) and 26 weeks (long-term). Short-term treatment produced a 15.5% decrease in mean blood pressure and interindividually variable effects on renal function. On average GFR was somewhat lower and CPAH slightly higher than the control values (not significant). This pattern is quite similar to the effects of most other antihypertensive drugs. On long-term therapy GFR rose by a mean of 9% (NS) and CPAH by 17% (p less than 0.02). However, in a patient who developed a captopril-induced nephrotic syndrome, GFR dropped to 56% and CPAH to 50% of the control values. In another patient a transient rise in serum creatinine accompanied a severe drug reaction.", 
    "210": "Extrarenal sites are the major source of erythropoietin (Ep) production in fetuses and neonates. Afterwards, however, the kidneys are the major site. The most likely site of Ep production is the liver, although attempts to extract Ep from the liver have been, to date, unsuccessful. Extrarenal Ep production, as is the case for renal Ep production, is regulated primarily by the oxygen demand: supply. However, some differences have been identified in the response of extrarenal and renal sites of Ep production to several conditions. Two classes of conditions that selectively influence extrarenal Ep production are the subject of this paper. These are the following: 1) factors that cause reparable hepatic injury--including partial hepatectomy, CC14, and bile duct ligation, and 2) continuous perfusion of angiotensin II. The differences between the mechanism by which these two factors influence extrarenal Ep production will be explored and discussed.", 
    "211": "Richter's discovery of the salt appetite that follows adrenalectomy (1936) raised the question: how does the brain appreciate the need for sodium so that it can mobilize the search for and ingestion of salty substances? It remains unanswered. Recent work suggests that the answer may come from an understanding of the behavioral effects of the hormones of sodium conservation. Fluharty and I have found (Behavioral Neuroscience, 1983) that treatment of salt replete rats with low doses of both angiotensin (Ang II) and a mineralocorticoid (DOCA) evokes a rapid, reliable, and specific appetite for sodium solutions, and we have proposed that the hormones of renal sodium conservation are also the hormones for the behavioral defense against sodium deficiency. We can now report: That the same combined endocrine treatment will compel rats that do not need salt to search for it in a runway. That is, sodium replete rats that have been primed for 3 days with DOCA (500 micrograms/day), which does not produce an appetite for salt, and are then given a pulse intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Ang II (60 ng), which by itself does not produce an appetite for salt, will run in an alleyway in order to ingest small drops of 3% NaCl. The hormones act together to make the rat avid for salt and their action is sufficient to drive it to seek salt at a distance and to ingest it at a concentration that untreated rats avoid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "212": "Intracranial renin is a potent stimulus to sodium appetite and thirst, the effects being mediated by local generation of angiotensin II. Intakes are persistent and lead to fluid retention during the first 24 h (Avrith and Fitzsimons, 1983). Increased circulating renin after captopril treatment in adrenalectomized rats (Elfont and Fitzsimons, 1981), or in renal hypertension following partial inter-renal aortic ligation (Costales et al., 1982), also leads to increased intakes of 2.7% NaCl and water. Fluid intakes after aortic ligation were independent of the severity of hypertension produced by this procedure. In both the examples given, additional stimulation resulting from the hypovolaemia itself is required for the full expression of increased sodium appetite, but in both cases angiotensin makes a significant contribution to sodium appetite as well as thirst. Therefore, as has been shown for thirst, angiotensin is one of a number of factors that act together to cause increased sodium appetite in hypovolaemia.", 
    "213": "The effects of intracisternal injection of captopril (0.3 mg/kg) on the systolic pressor response elicited by afferent stimulation of the vagus were investigated in the anaesthetized dog. The captopril-induced decrease in the systolic pressor response to vagal stimulation was reversed by a subsequent injection of naloxone (0.1 mg/kg i.v.). These results suggest the involvement of central opioid mechanisms in the hypotensive properties of captopril.", 
    "214": "Perinatal anoxia, or postnatal hypoxemia, as seen during respiratory distress syndrome, profoundly affects renal function. Hypoxemic neonates present with decreased water excretion, impaired diluting ability, urine acidification, glomerular filtration rate and renal perfusion. Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system may explain, at least in part, the pathogenesis of the hypoxemia-induced renal changes. The renal defects are reversible upon restoring normoxemia, extracellular fluid volume and cardiac output. The neonatal kidney can also be affected by iatrogenic manipulations. Drugs acting efficiently on several target-organs can profoundly impair renal function. Tolazoline, sometimes used as a pulmonary vasodilator in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the premature infant, can increase renal vascular resistance with consequent renal failure. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin-synthetase inhibitor used to medically close a patent ductus arteriosus, can depress glomerular filtration and water excretion in the newborn infant. Aminoglycosides are widely used in neonatology. They can easily accumulate in neonates whose GFR is low. Their nephrotoxicity may be lower in neonates than in adults, but is certainly not negligible. Experimental studies and a clinical observation have shown that captopril, a competitive inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme can produce renal damage in the fetus. Recent progress in pharmacology has provided the neonatologist with effective drugs which are of great value in the neonatal ward. They should however always be used with caution if detrimental side-effects are to be avoided.", 
    "215": "Acute hemodynamic effects of oral 25 mg of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were studied in 8 patients suffering from left ventricular failure and severe chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) with pulmonary hypertension. In all the patients left ventricular failure resulted from a dilated cardiomyopathy. No significant change in right or left ventricular function and a decrease of 10% in arterial blood pressure and total systemic resistances were observed after administration of captopril. It is suggested that patients suffering from left ventricular failure and severe chronic obstructive lung disease will not benefit from administration of captopril.", 
    "216": "Structural changes in resistance vessels of the lower limbs have been detected in early stages of arterial hypertension. In these patients it might be important to reduce blood pressure by drugs which do not impair peripheral blood flow. Twenty-four patients with arterial hypertension, without target organ damage were randomly given a placebo, 50 mg captopril, 500 mg methyldopa or 2.5 mg indapamide and their blood pressure, arterial blood flow and peripheral resistance were measured at baseline and at the peak action of the antihypertensive treatment. Significant decreases in blood pressure and peripheral resistance have been induced by a single oral dose of captopril and methyldopa: a concomitant significant increase in peripheral blood flow to the lower limbs was also observed during methyldopa treatment. No acute effect was observed on the placebo or on indapamide: the latter induced a decrease in blood pressure and in peripheral resistance along with an increase in arterial blood flow during long-term treatment after four weeks of therapy. Our observations seem to support the usefulness in hypertensive patients with concomitant lesions in the peripheral arterial tree of antihypertensive agents such as methyldopa and indapamide which increase blood flow and reduce peripheral resistance while lowering high blood pressure.", 
    "217": "Polyunsaturate-rich vegetable oils (sunflower oil, linseed oil, primrose oil) augment the hypotensive effect of dihydralazine, clonidine and captopril in rats under different experimental conditions. Evidence has accumulated that these effects are mediated via changes in prostanoid formation and sympathetic activity.", 
    "218": "During long-term captopril administration to hypertensive patients on maintenance hemodialysis, a decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count was observed in 9 out of 12 cases. The maximum decrease in hemoglobin, on the average, was detected after 10.9 months of captopril treatment, when the average decrease was 20.5%. The average daily dose of the drug was 27.6 mg/day throughout the observation period. Mean corpuscular constants, reticulocyte count, serum iron, and total iron-binding capacity did not change significantly. Coombs' test was negative. Neither serum total protein nor body weight changed significantly. Fever, skin rashes, leukopenia, and eosinophilia were not observed. There was no significant correlation between the degree of decrease in hematological indices and the dose of captopril. After discontinuation of captopril administration, anemia improved to pretreatment levels. In 2 of the 3 patients who did not show worsening of anemia, an anabolic steroid was administered in association with captopril. It is suggested that captopril should be used with caution in hemodialysis patients.", 
    "219": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was used to treat 14 patients with lupus nephritis and severe hypertension. All patients had reduced renal function and were on regular immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids and azathioprine. The initial dosage of captopril was reduced according to the level of renal impairment. 11 patients were treated for more than 6 months. Excellent blood pressure control was achieved with captopril, from a mean of 178 +/- 7/110 +/- 4 to 145 +/- 5/92 +/- 3 mm Hg at 6 months, usually in combination with a diuretic only. In 5 cases, a beta-blocker was added. In 3 patients, captopril therapy was discontinued within the 1st month of treatment. 1 patient did not respond to captopril at all; 1 patient had a rejection crisis and required dialysis; in 1 case, a general exanthema developed within 3 weeks and captopril medication was stopped. In addition to blood pressure control, renal function improved in 7 of the long-term-treated patients (mean increase in glomerular filtration rate 73 +/- 34%). In 3 patients, a continued slow deterioration renal function occurred, and in 1 patient, renal function remained unchanged. It is concluded that captopril is an effective antihypertensive drug in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Captopril treatment increased renal function in 64% of patients on long-term therapy. Not only optimal blood pressure control but other factors may also contribute to this beneficial effect, such as drug-induced prostaglandin release potentiating immunosuppressive treatment. Captopril may in fact be the drug of choice for the treatment of SLE patients with severe hypertension.", 
    "220": "Increased pancreatic insulin secretion may be one of the factors associated with the insulinlike activity (ILA) of endotoxemia. While there is little doubt that the prominent hypoglycemia of endotoxicosis is often preceded by systemic hyperinsulinemia, the cause of this increased secretion and its cause-and-effect relationship to the glucose deficit is less obvious. Recently, a \"misinformed B-cell\" hypothesis was proposed in which it was suggested that increased glucose flux across the pancreatic B-cell early in endotoxemia might lead to a misinterpretation of the existing glycemic state, resulting in increased insulin release. This possibility was based in part on the observation that increased 6-3H-glucose-derived rates of glucose disappearance (Rd) in endotoxic Yucatan minipigs preceded the onset of systemic hyperinsulinemia. Examination herein of the chronological order of events in this group of pigs and three other groups treated with lidocaine, naloxone, or captopril reveals an increase in pancreatic insulin secretory rate most often before increases in systemic Rd. Each of the three therapies were administered as a primed continuous intravenous infusion, 1 hour after the initiation of a continuous intravenous infusion of Difco 055:B5 E. coli lipopolysaccharide at an LD67 dose of 15 micrograms/kg/hr. In those pigs receiving no therapy, lidocaine, or naloxone, significant increases in pancreatic insulin secretion recurred at 40, 40, and 60 min following the onset of endotoxemia respectively. This was followed in 20 min by the first significant increase in relative glucose disappearance rates (%Rd). Captopril-treated pigs experienced a significant increase in %Rd at 60 min, which was followed in 20 min by a significant increase in pancreatic insulin secretion. In all groups, a significant hyperinsulinemia occurred transiently at 80 min postendotoxin, followed in 20 min by the onset of significant hypoglycemia. These observations suggest that increases in %Rd and transient increases in insulin secretion may be simultaneous events at best, and that along with significant increases in absolute levels of hepatic insulin extraction (observed in all groups at 60 or 80 min postendotoxin) may indicate some local effect of insulin release on hepatic glucose.", 
    "221": "We present a case of neonatal renal failure following a pregnancy complicated by hypertension treated with captopril. Clinical investigations showed structurally normal kidneys, suggesting a renal dysfunction other than that seen with the more common causes of neonatal renal failure. Recent animal and human data would support our hypothesis that transplacental captopril could have produced the clinical picture seen in our patient. Our findings do not unequivocally implicate captopril as the offending agent; however, since captopril is not considered to be teratogenic, a more widespread use may be anticipated in pregnancies complicated by severe hypertension. Surveillance of such pregnancies may yield more information regarding the above association.", 
    "222": "The effects of oral captopril on pulmonary haemodynamics were studied in two groups of 6 patients, one of subjects with chronic respiratory failure (PaO2 52 +/- 5.1 mmHg, PaCO2 54 +/- 2.1 mmHg), and the others with chronic heart failure and high plasma renin activity. Two potential mechanisms of its actions were assessed, namely inhibition of hypoxic vasoconstriction and inhibition of the possible effects of angiotensin II on the pulmonary circulation. There were significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in mean arterial pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure and in systemic arterial resistance associated with improvement in cardiac index in both groups. In the chronic respiratory failure group there was no change in blood gases, mean pulmonary arterial pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance. An increase in driving pressure (p less than 0.05) indicated that captopril had had no effect on pulmonary haemodynamics. In chronic heart failure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were decreased by a similar extent, so that driving pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were not changed. It is concluded that oral captopril did not inhibit hypoxic vasoconstriction, and that it modified pulmonary haemodynamics in chronic heart failure patients with high renin activity only as a consequence of reduction in systemic afterload.", 
    "223": "Seventy-four patients from four short-term studies of captopril in mild-moderate essential hypertension continued in a cooperative long-term efficacy and tolerance program. The duration of observation is 2- greater than 4 years, the total treatment time being 2434 months. No development of resistance to therapy was observed. The total daily dose of captopril has been gradually decreased and in 20 patients changed from t.i.d. to b.i.d. regime. The drug has been well tolerated and only few and mild side-effects have been observed after the initial titration period. The drop-outs (n = 19) were mostly due to non-medical causes (n = 14). Except for one case of proteinuria, no laboratory abnormalities were detected and there were no signs of long-term toxicity.", 
    "224": "The clinical utility of visualization of blood flow patterns across the tricuspid valve (TV) and pulmonary valve (PV) by M-mode contrast echocardiography was studied in 38 patients with documented valvular or congenital heart disease and in 15 controls. Diastolic turbulence was observed in the TV outflow side in three patients with tricuspid stenosis. Turbulent flow was also detected during systole in patients with septal defects (atrial septal defect in four patients and ventricular septal defect in one patient) in the right ventricular outflow tract and in three atrial septal defect patients also in the inflow tract, presumably because of increased volume of flow. Tricuspid regurgitation (11 patients) was characterized by retrograde laminar jet throughout systole, while in pulmonary regurgitation (six patients) retrograde flow was initially laminar although later on it might become turbulent. In pulmonary hypertension (29 patients) antegrade flow occurred approximately to mid-systole and then was interrupted by retrograde laminar flow which contributed to the mid-systolic closure of the pulmonary valve and pulmonary regurgitation in some cases.", 
    "225": "contrast echocardiography is a useful technique to analyse right heart blood flow patterns and may aid the diagnosis of various right heart abnormalities.", 
    "226": "After receiving placebo for two weeks, 20 patients with essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups. Those in group 1 received a combination of 25 mg of captopril (CPT) and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) BID. Those in group 2 received a combination of 80 mg of oxprenolol (OXP) and 10 mg of chlorthalidone (CHLT) BID. Patients whose recumbent diastolic blood pressure was less than 95 mmHg after four weeks of treatment continued with the same regimen for six more weeks, while the dosages were doubled for nonresponders. All the patients in group 1 had satisfactory blood pressure readings after the first four weeks of therapy; six patients in group 2 required double dosages to control their blood pressure. Both drug combinations reduced patients' recumbent systolic blood pressure, but CPT + HCT reduced their diastolic and standing systolic blood pressure more effectively. Doubling the dosages of OXP + CHLT was only slightly more effective in controlling patients' blood pressure. In addition, patients who received CPT + HCT showed a significant decrease in serum sodium level, whereas patients who received the double dosages of OXP + CHLT showed a significant increase in serum cholesterol and creatinine levels. The data suggest that low dosages of CPT + HCT control blood pressure more effectively than high dosages of OXP + CHLT and, in addition, do not have any negative metabolic effects.", 
    "227": "Low basal and stimulated plasma renin activity (PRA) levels have been reported in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). We have measured PRA before and after stimulation with captopril in 28 patients with DN and in 25 control patients. Renal function impairment was similar in both groups. Most patients were treated with furosemide. In 19 patients with DN the PRA-response to dihydralazine was also studied. PRA before and after captopril were higher in the DN than in the control group (p less than 0.001). PRA increased from 4.6 +/- 3.6 to 6.3 +/- 5.3 in the DN, and from 1.8 +/- 2.7 to 2.7 +/- 3.4 in the control patients. The increases in PRA, caused by decreased angiotensin II feed-back inhibition, were comparable. PRA did not increase after dihydralazine despite a pronounced blood-pressure reduction. The difference in response to these stimuli indicate selective lesions involving both the sympathetic innervation and the renal baroreceptor function in DN. Overhydration is a plausible explanation to the low PRA earlier reported in DN. The results thus indicate that a preserved renin secretion capacity is present in DN. Differences in PRA between the both groups can only partly be explained by other factors than DN. Our findings indicate a role for the reninangiotensin-system in hypertension in DN.", 
    "228": "The experience with captopril is limited in patients who are hypertensive after renal transplantation. An increased risk of side effects has been expected because of immunosuppressive therapy and a reduced renal function. We have used captopril in 58 transplanted patients with hypertension. On previous antihypertensive treatment diastolic blood pressure could not be maintained below 100 mm Hg. All patients were on immunosuppressive therapy using prednisolone in combination with azathioprine or cyclosporin. Before captopril treatment the mean s-creatinine concentration was 225 +/- 143 mumol/l. Fifty-four patients were treated for more than four weeks and 28 of them for six months or more. The mean daily dose of captopril was 90 mg. All patients also used furosemide and 2/3 were on a beta-blocker. Captopril was discontinued in nine cases within the first two months, in three because of an unsatisfactory effect on BP, in four because of side effects and in two after successful treatment of a renal artery stenosis of the transplant. The patients who were treated with captopril within the first year after transplantation responded better than patients where treatment was started more than one year after transplantation (p less than 0.05). Half of the patients given captopril early even showed a decrease of s-creatinine during treatment. Captopril in combination with a diuretic and a beta-blocker reduces blood pressure in patients with treatment resistant hypertension following renal transplantation. The risk for serious side effects is small provided that the captopril dose is low and white cell counts and s-creatinine levels are closely monitored.", 
    "229": "The aim of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the probable role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, the kallikrein-kinins and the prostaglandins systems on the various types of essential hypertension and also their contribution to the action of captopril. Nineteen patients, 7 with high and 12 with normal or low levels of plasma renin activity (PRA), have been studied. Captopril (100 mg) was administered in acute dosage, blood pressure was checked for two hours and PRA and plasma aldosterone were assayed. The same trial was repeated after inhibition of prostaglandin-synthetase with indomethacin and kallikrein with trasylol, alternatively, and then with indomethacin and trasylol, contemporaneously. Our results showed that the renal vasodilative system was probably also involved in the mechanism of action of captopril, but that this drug reduced blood pressure mainly through a block of angiotensin II production in both groups of patients. Thus the finding of a normal or low PRA does not justify the conclusion that angiotensin II is not one of the mechanisms responsible for an elevated arterial pressure.", 
    "230": "Thirty-two patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension whose supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg following 2 weeks' treatment with the optimal dosage of beta blocker-diuretic combination were randomly assigned to the addition of either captopril 25 mg or 50 mg b.i.d. After 6 weeks' treatment, if patients were not normalized (SDBP less than 95 mm Hg), the dose of captopril was doubled for a further 6 weeks. The addition of captopril led to a significant fall in standing and supine diastolic and systolic blood pressure at the end of the sixth and twelfth week of treatment. There was no difference in the change in blood pressure between the two groups. At the end of the study SDBP was normalized in 66% of patients and a further 12.5% had their SDBP reduced by greater than 10%. Captopril 25 or 50 mg administered twice daily proved to be a very effective antihypertensive agent when added to a beta blocker-diuretic combination in patients resistant to optimal doses of these drugs.", 
    "231": "Ten consanguine monogamous SHR couples (G1) were treated from their 5th to their 37th week of age with captopril, 50 mg/kg/day i.p. Male rats were treated without interruption. Treatment was withheld in female rats from delivery to weaning. They were compared to ten similar SHR couples which were only daily i.p. injected with the same volume of solvent. Second (G2) generation rats (untreated) were studied. In G1 rats, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) ratio were decreased, while heart rate (HR) was not changed. Plasma renin activity remained unchanged at 37 weeks of age though the treatment was effective. Parental treatment did not reduce SBP and HW/BW ratio in G2 rats. This indicates that reduction of hypertension in SHR is not enough to prevent hypertension development in the offspring of the treated rats.", 
    "232": "Hemodynamic effects of captopril were examined in chronic one-kidney, one clip renal hypertensive rabbits and normotensive controls either in normal sodium or in sodium depletion. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) of hypertensive and normotensive rabbits in sodium depletion did not differ from that in normal sodium, while plasma renin activity (PRA) was elevated by sodium depletion. The cardiac output of sodium depleted groups decreased slightly. The increase in total peripheral resistance was greater in hypertensive than in normotensive groups. The MAP in all groups was decreased by acute administration of captopril irrespective of sodium intake. The decrease in MAP in the sodium-depleted hypertensive group was correlated with the control values of PRA, but no correlation was observed in other groups. Captopril significantly reduced the cardiac output of the sodium-depleted hypertensive group, but not of the other groups. These results show that: (1) the lowering effect of captopril on arterial pressure is not mediated only by blocking of the renin-angiotensin system, and (2) the decrease in cardiac output with captopril in sodium depleted hypertensive rabbits is an important factor in the reduction in the arterial pressure.", 
    "233": "The effect of a converting-enzyme inhibitor (captopril) was studied in nine conscious dehydrated Merino ewes. Captopril (4 mg I.V. over 40 min) caused significant decreases in mean arterial blood pressure (M.A.B.P.), renal vascular resistance (R.V.R.) and filtration fraction, and increases in urine flow (V), sodium excretion, glomerular filtration rate (G.F.R.), renal plasma flow, solute clearance (Cosm), solute-free water reabsorption (TC, H2O) and plasma renin activity (P.R.A.). None of these effects was observed when captopril was similarly administered to sheep pretreated with angiotensin II (AII) receptor blocker, 1-sarcosine-8-isoleucine-AII (sarileucin). It is concluded that the effects of captopril were probably not due to bradykinin potentiation but rather to decreased levels of circulating AII. The effect of sarileucin itself was complex. It effectively blocked the pressor response to administered AII, but it also had an AII-like effect indicated by a rise in R.V.R., and decreases in V, G.F.R., Cosm and TC, H2O. This apparent mixture of AII agonist and antagonist properties probably accounts for the absence of any change in M.A.B.P. or P.R.A. during sarileucin administration.", 
    "234": "The mechanism of sodium retention in the nephrotic syndrome remains controversial, though the classic pathophysiological explanation is stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Recent evidence has shown that many patients with the nephrotic syndrome have a normal or low plasma renin activity suggesting that there might be an intrarenal cause for their sodium retention. We gave captopril, an oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, during 10 separate episodes of sodium retention in nephrotic syndrome. There was evidence of stimulation of the renin system in 7 of these episodes. Despite a marked fall in plasma aldosterone, all patients continued to retain sodium and water and gain weight. This demonstrates that the sodium retention of nephrotic syndrome is not due to stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but must be due to some other mechanism, which is probably intrarenal.", 
    "235": "A radioimmunoassay for the measurement of total captopril in serum and heparinized plasma has been developed. Prior to the assay, serum or heparinized plasma samples are subjected to tri-n-butyl-phosphine reduction followed by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) derivatization. The assay utilizes in-house NEM-captopril antibody, [125I]NEM-captopril radiolabel and human serum standards. Satisfactory zero binding and sensitivity are obtained after 3 h of incubation at room temperature. Separation of the antibody-bound and free radiolabeled antigen is achieved by employing a polyethylene glycol solution. The assay was shown to have excellent parallelism, recovery, and precision. Cross-reactivities with potentially interfering substances were low.", 
    "236": "In an attempt to study the possible mechanism(s) by which captopril controls resistant heart failure, sequential haemodynamic studies (radioisotope technique) and humoral measurements (plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and plasma catecholamines) were obtained in 11 such patients. The studies were made at the time patients became unresponsive to other vasodilators (hydralazine or prazosin); the vasodilator drug was then discontinued and five days later, the 'no-vasodilator' studies were obtained. Captopril therapy was then started. Optimum daily maintenance dose of captopril varied from 75 to 200 mg in different patients. Studies were again repeated after a period of time equal to the duration of the previous vasodilator therapy. Digitalis and diuretic doses were kept constant throughout. Captopril improved effort tolerance in ten patients. Haemodynamically, mean blood pressure and peripheral resistance were lower than during vasodilator therapy (85 +/- 3.1 v. 92 +/- 3.3 mmHg and 47 +/- 4.4 v. 59 +/- 4.4 U.M2, respectively; p less than 0.05 for both). Cardiac index was higher during captopril treatment (1.95 +/- 0.15 v. 1.63 +/- 0.10 l/m2, p less than 0.01) and pulmonary mean transit was normalized by captopril (14.6 +/- 1.7 v. 18.4 +/- 1.3 s, p less than 0.05). Humoral indices revealed a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in plasma aldosterone during captopril therapy (25.9 +/- 5.6 ng/dl during captopril, v. 62 +/- 22 ng/dl with no vasodilators and 50.9 +/- 6.1 ng/dl with other vasodilators). Moreover, there was a decrease in circulating plasma catecholamines during captopril treatment, but differences between the three treatment periods were not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "237": "Angiotensin II (AII), a potent vasoconstrictor, contributes to ischemic and decompensatory phases of shock. Captopril may benefit vital organ and tissue perfusion by inhibiting AII formation. We fitted 13 approximately 50-kg pigs with jugular, portal, hepatic vein, and carotid artery catheters, and hepatic artery and portal vein flow cuffs to quantitate portosystemic and transhepatic kinetics. We placed them in slings 72 hr later and following a 3-hr control period, they were infused with E. coli endotoxin at 15 micrograms/kg/hr for 6 hr. We kept eight as controls and five received a primed (2 mg/kg) continuous infusion (2 mg/kg/hr) of captopril 1 hr after initiation of endotoxin. Arterial hypotension developed by 60 min and hypoglycemia by 100 min in both groups; captopril had no effect on these parameters. Blood lactate increased from 7.8-32.1 mg/dl 80 min postendotoxin, and for the third to fifth hours of endotoxin infusion was significantly higher than those of the control group. 6-3H-glucose-derived appearance (Ra) values remained at 1.88-2.35 mg/kg/min throughout the experiment. Glucose disappearance (Rd) values were elevated from 60-120 min of endotoxin, increasing to 2.68-3.13 mg/kg/min versus 1.86 mg/kg/min preendotoxin. These changes corresponded to those in lactate, and incurred only a brief significant net glucose deficit (%Rd-%Ra) that peaked at 61.1% at 100 min. For 140-360 min postendotoxin, glucose balance was at most 8.3% in deficit (200 min) and 13.6% in positive balance (280 min) versus a net deficit of up to 25.4% (220 min) for the untreated group for much of the experiment. Portal and hepatic venous blood flow in captopril-treated pigs was lower than that in untreated pigs before endotoxin (8.2 and 10.0 ml/kg/min versus 12.9 and 17.9 ml/kg/min, respectively), but was not depressed following endotoxin infusion, versus 50% reductions in the untreated pigs, postendotoxin. Captopril maintained hepatosplanchnic blood flow and effected modest improvements in glucose kinetics.", 
    "238": "D-Penicillamine and captopril, two drugs that induce autoimmune manifestations in man, were administered orally for 5 to 10 months to various strains of rats. Three to eight weeks after D-penicillamine administration in a dosage of 20 to 50 mg per day, 73% of Brown Norway (BN) rats became ill. The disease was characterized by weight loss, dermatitis, and a high mortality presumably caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation. Microscopy revealed widespread granulomatous and necrotic lesions. The plasma of these animals contained antinuclear antibodies and immune complexes. In the kidney deposits of IgG were found in a linear pattern along the glomerular basement membrane. IgG eluted from diseased kidneys bound both \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" to kidney basement membranes. BN rats initially receiving 5 mg of D-penicillamine per day and subsequently 20 and 50 mg per day did not develop disease. No adverse effects were noted in Lewis (LEW) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats treated with 20 or 50 mg of D-penicillamine per day, nor in BN and LEW rats treated with 20 mg of captopril per day.", 
    "239": "The inhibitor of the pressor effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP), d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, at a dose of 5 micrograms/kg iv was shown in four healthy volunteers to antagonize the blood pressure, heart rate, and skin blood flow response to a lysine vasopressin infusion of 1 mIU X kg-1 X min-1. The inhibition lasted for more than 2 h. When the same dose of the vasopressin antagonist was administered to 10 healthy normally hydrated volunteers with their renin system intact or acutely blocked by 25 mg of captopril po, none of the above parameters changed. It is concluded that circulating vasopressin, even in the face of a blocked renin-angiotensin system, does not actively contribute to maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis.", 
    "240": "The mechanisms whereby the pituitary gland maintains arterial pressure were investigated in rats. The arterial pressure in hypophysectomized rats was 30 mmHg below normal. Saralasin or captopril caused a further fall of 25 and 30 mmHg, respectively, suggesting that the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in blood pressure maintenance in hypophysectomized rats. Growth hormone administration to hypophysectomized rats increased the arterial pressure, but pretreatment with captopril prevented the effect. Plasma renin activity and basal renin secretion (in vitro) was normal in hypophysectomized rats despite a twofold greater renal renin content. Secretory responsiveness to isoproterenol and calcium omission was lower in hypophysectomized rats. It is concluded that the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in maintaining arterial blood pressure in hypophysectomized rats although the responsiveness of the system may be decreased.", 
    "241": "A 53-year-old woman with nephroptosis and aortitis disease was found also to have orthostatic hypertension. When standing, she had high renin levels and normal catecholamine values, with a reduced baroreflex sensitivity. This orthostatic hypertension largely may be due to an activation of the renin system caused by nephroptosis and partly due to a reduced baroreflex sensitivity caused by aortitis. Captopril and propranolol hydrochloride were effective for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "242": "To determine the acute and chronic effects of vasodilator therapy in children, vasodilator therapy was evaluated in 13 children (aged 0.2 to 14.5 years) with severe left ventricular dysfunction or mitral regurgitation. In seven children, nitroprusside increased cardiac index by an average of 33% (P less than .01) and increased stroke index by 29% (P less than .01). In eight children, hydralazine caused a 31% increase in cardiac index (P less than .01) and a 27% increase in stroke index (P less than .02). Ten children received chronic oral vasodilator therapy and were followed for 5.7 +/- 1.4 (SEM) months. Early clinical improvement was observed in every child. Symptoms of heart failure diminished in all, and five children became entirely asymptomatic. A significant (P less than .05) improvement was noted in growth velocity, respiratory rate, heart size, and incidence of gallop rhythm after 1 month of therapy. The duration of the beneficial response to vasodilator therapy varied considerably, however, and significant improvement for the group was not found after 1 month. Four children had sustained clinical improvement for 6 months or longer, but the others experienced recurrent heart failure within 1 to 4 months.", 
    "243": "The converting enzyme inhibitor CGS 13928C was evaluated in 15 healthy male volunteers. First the efficacy of a single oral dose of 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 mg in antagonizing the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I was tested with continuous monitoring of the blood pressure and heart rate by an intraarterial catheter. CGS 13928C 1, 2 and 5 mg consistently reduced the response to angiotensin within 2 to 3 h and for a period exceeding the 4 h of monitoring. The 2 mg dose was hardly more effective than 1 mg and 5 mg did not further enhance the blockade. Subsequently, plasma renin and converting enzyme activity, angiotensin I, angiotensin II and aldosterone were measured serially before and up to 72 h following oral administration of either 1 mg (n = 7) or 2 mg (n = 8) CGS 13928C. As expected, plasma renin activity and angiotensin I rose, while plasma converting enzyme activity, angiotensin II and aldosterone fell following both doses of the drug. No side-effects occurred. In normal volunteers CGS 13928C is an effective and extremely potent, orally active converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "244": "Experiments were conducted in pithed Wistar rats to assess the effects of nephrectomy on the responsiveness of the cardiovascular system to sympathetic neurohumoral stimuli. Blood pressure and heart rate increases produced in response to stimulation of the spinal sympathetic outflow and to norepinephrine were compared in nephrectomized (NXR) and sham operated animals (SOR). Both the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) increases to nerve stimulation were markedly attenuated in the NXR, however, only the reduction in BP responses could be attributed to the absence of a functional renin angiotensin system. Infusion of angiotensin II (10 ng/kg/min) in NXR enhanced the neurally mediated increments in BP to the extent that the responses were not different from SOR. Angiotensin II administration also enhanced BP responses in SOR but to a lesser extent than in NXR. HR responses were not altered by angiotensin in NXR or SOR. Blockade of the renin angiotensin system in SOR with the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, reduced BP responses to the same level as NXR. In contrast, HR increments were not altered by captopril. BP but not HR increments to norepinephrine were significantly reduced in NXR. Infusion of angiotensin II restored the BP responses to a level equal to SOR; HR responses were not affected. In addition, captopril reduced the norepinephrine responses of SOR but not NXR. Thus the results of the present study indicate that endogenously formed angiotensin facilitates sympathetically mediated vasoconstrictor activity but does not influence heart rate responses. Therefore, the attenuation of neurally elicited increases in HR observed in NXR does not appear to be acutely related to reduced levels of angiotensin II.", 
    "245": "The effect of captopril, MK-421 and MK-422 on fibrinolysis was investigated in vitro with 3 assay methods. Incorporation of captopril, but not MK-421 and MK-422, into fibrin clots resulted in a reduction of fibrinolysis by purified human plasmin. The concentrations of captopril required to demonstrate this effect far exceeded the therapeutic doses. Pre-mixing plasmin with captopril did not lead to a decreased lysis of fibrin plates. Furthermore, none of these agents affected the lysis of 125I-fibrin plates by a mixture of human serum and streptokinase. Captopril and MK-421, and to a much lesser extent MK-422, inhibited the amidolysis of a fluorogenic synthetic substrate by human plasmin; the inhibition was ameliorated by increasing the substrate concentration. Apparently, the inhibition of fibrinolysis by high doses of captopril, and of amidolysis by captopril and MK-421, appears to lie in their effects on the substrate (fibrin and synthetic substrate) rather than on the enzyme (plasmin).", 
    "246": "A patient is described who had accelerated hypertension and unilateral renal artery stenosis, and who developed further deterioration in renal function during treatment with captopril, an angiotension-I (AI) converting-enzyme inhibitor. 99mTc-DMSA uptake was greatly diminished in the stenotic kidney, although renal blood flow and handling of 131I-hippurate was preserved. Uptake of 99mTc-DMSA in the affected kidney returned after substitution of captopril by the vasodilator minoxidil, while a comparable degree of blood pressure control was maintained. Thus, caution must be taken when interpreting results of 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy in patients with proven or suspected renal artery stenosis treated with an AI converting-enzyme inhibiting drug. Moreover, our finding points to the importance of glomerular filtration in the renal handling of 99mTc-DMSA.", 
    "247": "he intermediate and latter stages of canine endotoxin shock are characterized by a progressive decrease in cardiac output, increase in total peripheral resistance, and hypoglycemia. We have hypothesized that the renin-angiotensin system and glucagon may mediate the loss of cardiovascular and glucose homeostasis. E. Coli endotoxin shock (1 mg/kg; 055:B5) was induced in three groups of dogs and systemic hemodynamics, angiotensin I activity, and glucagon were monitored for 5 hr; endotoxin shock (n = 13); endotoxin shock + prior immunization with J5 mutant of E coli 0111 (n = 5); Endotoxin + captopril (20 micrograms/kg/hr; n = 9); and sham-operated time-matched controls (n = 8). Thirty minutes postshock, angiotensin I and glucagon began to increase. Angiotensin I activity reached a peak at 60 min postendotoxin (90 +/- 25 vs 5 +/- ng/ml/hr; p less than 0.001) and plateaued. Increased glucagon levels plateaued at 3.5 hr postshock (1500 +/- 200 vs 155 +/- 77 pg/ml; p less than 0.001). Cardiac output began to progressively decrease, total peripheral resistance began to increase, and persistent hypoglycemia developed at 3 hr postshock. Captopril inhibited the increase in total peripheral resistance and had no effect on the decrease in cardiac output or the hypoglycemia. The initial glucagon response was attenuated but there was no difference at 5 hr (950 +/- 150 vs 1200 +/- 200 pg/ml). Prior immunization significantly preserved cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, plasma glucose levels, glucagon levels, and angiotensin I activity. It is concluded that 1) the renin-angiotensin system is a physiologic and not a pathophysiologic compensatory mechanism during the course of endotoxin shock and that inhibition of this system is deleterious; 2) glucagon may serve as an important mediator of both the myocardial dysfunction and glucose dyshomeostasis of endotoxin shock; and 3) immunological inhibition of the initial phase of endotoxin shock significantly preserves cardiovascular and glucose homeostasis and adds support to the concept that the initial vascular phase of endotoxin shock plays a primary role in determining the severity of the endotoxin/septic shock syndrome.", 
    "248": "Blockade of the actions of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis by inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme with captopril is a new tool in the field of hypertension. As treatment with captopril makes pressure control volume-dependent, the addition of a saluretic is considered the best choice if an additional hypotensive agent is needed. The reason for and experience of the use of captopril in combination with saluretics for treatment of severe hypertension is reviewed. Published results indicate that captopril alone is insufficient, but as many as a third of the patients with previously uncontrollable hypertension manage well when a saluretic is added. Only one in six remains uncontrolled despite the addition of several other hypotensive agents. These observations apply to both essential and secondary forms of hypertension.", 
    "249": "During diuretic treatment alterations in myocardial cellular excitability due to potassium-induced disturbances of the membrane potential may arise without obvious changes of total body K. This may be explained by coexisting disturbances of the acid/base balance and other ions such as magnesium, two factors which independently influence the transport of potassium across the cell membrane. The consequence may be cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis. On the other hand hypokalemia, induced by diuretics, may also be accompanied by a significant depletion of total body K, bringing about more general consequences. It must be considered essential to maintain a normal general electrolyte balance during diuretic therapy. Potassium supplements may be used if true depletion of total body K is suspected, e.g. in hypokalemia with acidosis. Its use may, however, otherwise be questioned, as it is only directed towards the potassium situation and neglects the influence of diuretics upon other ions, such as H+ and Mg++. The potassium-sparing agents amiloride and triamterene normalize the general electrolyte situation in the distal tubules and should thus be regarded as drugs of first choice. Spironolactone has identical properties concerning the electrolytes but more serious side effects. It should be preferred when a significant secondary hyperaldosteronism is suspected and/or a more intense diuresis or an accentuated antihypertensive action is desired. The role of captopril in this context has not yet been established.", 
    "250": "In order to investigate the relative contribution of ACTH, the renin angiotensin and dopaminergic system to the circadian rhythm of plasma aldosterone, hormone levels were determined at hourly intervals over a 24 h span in four supine healthy men. Blood was withdrawn under basal conditions (control), after either dexamethasone, captopril or bromocriptine++ (CB-154) administration. Plasma aldosterone rhythmicity was abolished in dexamethasone treated groups but not in captopril or CB treated groups. Time dependent alterations of aldosterone regulators were analyzed by multiple regression methods at 3 hourly intervals. These results indicate that plasma aldosterone rhythmicity is predominantly under the control of ACTH whereas the renin angiotensin or dopaminergic system plays a little role. In supine, sodium repleted states, ACTH is a potent stimulus of aldosterone at 000-0600 h and 1700-1900 h clocktime, whereas during daytime renin-angiotensin is an additional regulator.", 
    "251": "A randomized, double-blind, parallel treatment trial was carried out in 24 patients with moderate to severe hypertension to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of two treatment regimens in reducing and maintaining supine diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. Patients in Group I received 10 to 40 mg enalapril maleate per day with the addition of 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide per day and then 250 to 1000 mg alpha-methyldopa per day, if necessary. Patients in Group II received 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide per day with the addition of 80 to 240 mg propranolol and then 100 to 200 mg hydralazine per day, if necessary. Apart from the hydrochlorothiazide dosage which was fixed, the dosage of the other active drugs was titrated incrementally until the target blood pressure level was achieved. Blood pressures, heart rate and body weight were monitored at 2-weekly intervals during 26 weeks of active therapy. In Group I, blood pressure control was achieved and maintained with enalapril alone in 9 patients, 2 patients required double therapy and 1 patient triple therapy. In Group II, 9 patients required double therapy, 2 triple therapy, and only 1 patient received monotherapy. Supine and erect blood pressure control was comparable in both groups. There was, however, a significant decrease in supine heart rate in patients in Group II. More importantly, 8 of the 12 patients in Group II experienced non-life threatening adverse reactions (4 were hypokalaemic and required supplementary potassium, 2 had cold hands and feet, 1 man had sexual dysfunction and 1 acute gout) and no adverse reactions were reported by Group I patients.", 
    "252": "We investigated the kinetics of pulmonary angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in vivo by measuring the hydrolysis of a bolus dose of a synthetic ACE substrate, benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline (BPAP). Estimates of apparent Km and Vmax were calculated by multiple regression analysis using a nonlinear model of enzyme kinetics. A bolus injection of indocyanine green and BPAP was given into the jugular vein of anesthetized rabbits (3-4 kg b. wt.) and serial blood samples were collected at 1-sec intervals from the carotid artery. The concentration of indocyanine green, [3H]BPAP and its metabolite in each sample was used to construct pulmonary venous outflow concentration-time curves and to assess ACE activity. Addition of 0.04 to 2.6 mumol of unlabeled BPAP per kg to the injectate reduced [3H]BPAP metabolism in a dose-dependent manner, with a calculated ID50 of 0.37 mumol/kg at the peak of the outflow curve and 0.58 mumol/kg over the integral. There was a similar correlation between the concentration of BPAP in pulmonary blood, estimated from indocyanine green outflow curves, and the metabolism of [3H] BPAP. For each animal, application of the mathematical model provided statistically significant estimates of the kinetic constants for pulmonary BPAP metabolism in vivo. The apparent Km and Vmax were 9.3 +/- 0.8 and 63.1 +/- 9.5 mumol/sec/organ, respectively; the Vmax/Km was 6.8 +/- 1.0 ml/sec/organ. BPAP did not affect any of the hemodynamic parameters measured. The technique described provides a method for detailed study of the kinetics of pulmonary ACE in vivo and effects of inhibitor drugs or other experimental treatments on the function of this enzyme in the intact animal.", 
    "253": "Experiments were performed to determine if the activation of the renin-angiotensin system that occurs during the development of two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension in dogs is accompanied by increases in vasopressin and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion. Following renal artery constriction, there were marked increases in arterial blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma angiotensin II (AII) concentration. These changes were accompanied by an increase in plasma vasopressin concentration during the second week following constriction, and there were significant correlations between plasma vasopressin concentration and PRA (r = 0.57, p less than 0.001), and between plasma vasopressin concentration and plasma AII concentration (r = 0.59, p less than 0.001). In contrast, plasma corticosteroid concentration, used as an index of changes in ACTH secretion, did not change significantly. Acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril or saralasin produced the expected changes in blood pressure, PRA, and plasma AII concentration but did not decrease plasma vasopressin or corticosteroid concentrations. These results indicate that during the development of renal hypertension in dogs, there may be an interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin, but not between the renin-angiotensin system and the pituitary-adrenal axis. They also show that the antihypertensive action of captopril in this experimental model is not mediated via suppression of vasopressin, ACTH, or corticosteroid secretion.", 
    "254": "The use of captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme and enkephalinase, was associated with substantial mood elevation in three depressed patients. Substances that may alter neuropeptide synthesis or degradation warrant further investigation as therapeutic agents in certain neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "255": "The effects of the new nonsulfhydryl-containing oral converting-enzyme inhibitor MK-521 on blood pressure, heart rate, angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were assessed in 10 hypertensive patients. After a 2-week no-treatment period, patients received placebo and then 14 days each: MK-521 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg once daily and the latter 2 in combination. During the last day of each treatment, the mean (+/- standard deviation) time-averaged (1- to 12-hour) standing diastolic blood pressure decreased from 106 +/- 8 (placebo) to 95 +/- 10 mm Hg with MK-521, 95 +/- 13 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide (p less than 0.05 vs placebo) and 88 +/- 11 mm Hg with the combination (p less than 0.05 vs all other treatments). The antihypertensive effect of MK-521 was maintained 24 hours after dosing. Heart rate did not change significantly after MK-521 treatment. MK-521 caused a marked suppression of converting enzyme activity for over 24 hours; plasma renin activity increased significantly after each active treatment and MK-521 significantly decreased the hydrochlorothiazide-induced elevation of plasma aldosterone concentration. In this short-term trial, MK-521 was well tolerated.", 
    "256": "Enalapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is an effective antihypertensive agent for both renovascular and essential hypertension. It is structurally different from captopril in that it does not possess a sulfhydryl group. The systemic and renal hemodynamic, biochemical and cardiac adaptive changes induced by enalapril were studied in 8 patients with essential hypertension before and after 12 weeks of therapy. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 110 to 90 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), and this was mediated through a decrease in total peripheral resistance from 42 +/- 3 to 32 +/- 3 U (p less than 0.01). Cardiac index and heart rate did not change. Renal plasma flow was increased in 6 of 8 patients and renal vascular resistance decreased from 123 +/- 6 to 91 +/- 7 U (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular mass index decreased from a mean of 166 +/- 29 to 117 +/- 8 g/m2 (p less than 0.05) without impaired myocardial contractility. Thus, enalapril lowers arterial pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance without reflexive cardiac effects. It also has favorable hemodynamic effects on the kidney. This is the first report of regression of LV mass with this agent in man.", 
    "257": "The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a major role in blood pressure regulation. Although the exact relationship of the SNS to the etiology of hypertension remains undetermined, many of the agents used to treat hypertension interfere with this system. Clonidine, methyldopa, guanethidine, and reserpine decrease SNS tone whereas hydralazine, minoxidil, and hydrochlorothiazide increase it. Most evidence suggests that beta-adrenergic blocking agents decrease SNS activity. The effect of prazosin and captopril on the SNS requires further study. The appropriate use of these antihypertensive agents requires a knowledge of their sites of action and the physiological reflexes they induce. Efficacy, toxicity, and effective drug combinations can be predicted based on their mechanism of action and effect on SNS activity.", 
    "258": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in blood vessels of different species was determined. ACE was solubilized by Nonidet P-40, and assayed by reversible phase high performance liquid chromatography. Approximately 98% ACE was recovered in the liquid phase by the use of the detergent. The ACE activity varied with chloride ion (Cl-) concentrations; the maximum activities in dog, human, monkey and rabbit tissues were obtained at the concentrations of 800, 600, 600 and 300 mmol/l respectively. The optimal Cl- concentration was quite similar in different tissues and plasma obtained from the same species. The ACE activity in the cerebral, mesenteric, pulmonary and renal arteries was in a range between 1.01 and 1.60 m-units/mg of protein in dogs and between 0.43 and 0.94 m-unit/mg of protein in monkeys. The activity in dog aortae was 0.20 +/- 0.02 m-unit/mg of protein, and the activity in aortic endothelial cells was 2.61 +/- 0.65 m-units/mg of protein. ACE activities in the dog lung, kidney cortex and cerebral cortex were 28.6 +/- 2.6, 15.7 +/- 3.0 and 3.5 +/- 0.6 m-units/mg of protein respectively. SA-446, a captopril-like ACE inhibitor, reduced the ACE activity in arteries in a dose-dependent manner. Vascular ACE appears to be concentrated in the endothelium and may contribute to regulate vascular muscle tone and local blood flow by a conversion of angiotensin I into II.", 
    "259": "During immersion in sitting position to the neck of 10 normal adult males, natriuria is significantly increased even after pretreatment with captopril (2 mg X kg-1, p.o.). Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade does not completely block the mechanisms causing natriuria during immersion.", 
    "260": "Superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) of Wistar rats brought about a significant increase of plasma renin activity (PRA) 9 or 15 days later, an effect not observed 48 days after surgery. The same surgical procedure performed in Chbb Tom rats did not result in significant modification of PRA. In both strains of rats immobilization stress induced a 2.3-3.3-fold increase of PRA regardless of whether the animals had intact superior cervical ganglia. The injection of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril to SCGx Wistar rats at the time of elevated PRA induced a severe hypotension, while it did not affect blood pressure in sham-operated animals. In both strains of rats SCGx resulted in depressed circulating aldosterone levels at all studied times after surgery.", 
    "261": "The effect of captopril (SQ 14,225) on the renal hemodynamics, cortical plasma flow (CPF) and noncortical plasma flow (NCPF), was studied in sodium-replete anesthetized dogs during aprotinin infusion. Mean blood pressure (MBP) increased by aprotinin (p less than 0.05) and decreased by captopril (p less than 0.02). Renal vascular resistance (RVR) tended to increase by aprotinin and decreased from 1.29 to 0.86 mm Hg/ml/h (74.7%) by captopril (p less than 0.05). Renal vein renin activity (RRA) inclined to decrease by aprotinin and increased from 17.8 to 47.2 ng/ml/h (278.2%) by captopril (p less than 0.05). Although the administration of captopril alone did not alter the renal hemodynamics despite the reduction of MBP, captopril made a recovery of renal plasma flow (RPF), CPF and NCPF which had decreased by aprotinin. Especially, CPF showed a significant recovery from 45.4 to 55.6 ml/min (123.6%) by captopril (p less than 0.02). These results indicate that the inhibition of endogenous angiotensin made a preferential increase in CPF and suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in the effect of captopril of the renal hemodynamic changes.", 
    "262": "Studies were undertaken in order to demonstrate the role of the renin-angiotensin system for blood pressure homeostasis in sodium depleted and renal hypertensive (acute and chronic) rats. Purified antibodies and Fab fragment against mouse submaxillary were able to complete inhibited plasma activity in rats. The depressor response was compared with the converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide SQ20881. Teprotide, showed an additional depressor response indicating that effect of converting enzyme blockade is due to factors other than renin-angiotensin blockade.", 
    "263": "Enalapril, a new potent orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was studied in cats subjected to acute myocardial ischemia. Enalapril, administered intravenously (2 mg/kg, plus 2 mg/kg/h) 30 min after ligation of the left coronary artery, significantly reduced the pressure-rate index, an indicator of myocardial oxygen demand. This was confirmed in isolated cat papillary muscles where enalapril reduced contractile force by 5-10%. During myocardial ischemia, enalapril reversed the elevated S-T segment of the electrocardiogram toward normal 2 h after the onset of ischemia. Moreover, enalapril significantly blunted the increases in circulating creatine kinase (CK) activity, as well as significantly prevented the loss in myocardial CK activity. These changes correlated with reduced myocardial loss of compounds containing free amino-nitrogen. Enalapril effectively acted as a converting enzyme inhibitor over the 5-hour course of the observation period. However, enalapril also acted as an angiotensin antagonist in isolated coronary arteries, a finding that may help explain its efficacy in myocardial ischemia. Enalapril did not appear to stabilize the membranes of cat liver lysosomes, and thus probably does not protect the ischemic myocardium by lysosomal stabilization.", 
    "264": "Rats with two-kidney, one-clip hypertension (2K1C) have a marked rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) and, when drinking 0.9% NaCl as their sole source of sodium, have increased exchangeable and total body sodium levels. These changes are reversed by the administration of captopril. The one-kidney, one-clip (1K1C) model has no rise in PRA or increase in body sodium level after either an early or a late contralateral nephrectomy. The data indicate that hypertension in the 2K1C model is due to the high angiotensin levels in these animals. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system requires the presence of the contralateral kidney but is not the result of sodium loss from that kidney. The reason for activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the 2K1C hypertensive rat remains obscure.", 
    "265": "Polyclonal antisera raised against pure human renin normalize renin-dependent blood pressure elevation in the monkey (M. fascicularis). In vitro, comparable inhibition of either human or monkey plasma renin by the antisera was demonstrated. In vivo, intravenous infusion of 2 ml of antisera did not change mean arterial pressure of salt-repleted monkeys, however, its administration to salt-depleted monkeys with elevated plasma renin activity lowered mean arterial pressure 10 Torr. A 25 Torr rise in mean arterial pressure and increase in plasma renin activity occurred promptly after inflation of a suprarenal aortic cuff in conscious uninephrectomized monkeys. Administration of 2 ml of antisera to these monkeys normalized mean pressure, which was reduced by an additional 10 Torr if the animals were previously salt-depleted. Maximal hypotension occurred within 1 hour and was sustained for approximately 10 hours. Because of the differing specificities of polyclonal antisera, sera raised in two laboratories against human renin purified from different sources were employed. Identical results were obtained. This is the first demonstration of the use of antisera to inhibit endogenous renin activity in primates and predicts the in vivo efficacy of renin antisera as experimental, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.", 
    "266": "The role of kinins in the hypertensive response to acute renal artery constriction (RAC) was examined in the dog. RAC resulted in an increase in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) from 144 +/- 6 to 155 +/- 4 mm HG (p less than 0.05). Simultaneously, arterial plasma bradykinin decreased from 2.3 +/- 0.2 to 1.4 +/- 0.1 ng/ml (p greater than 0.01), while renal venous bradykinin remained unchanged (2.3 +/- 0.2 to 2.0 +/- 0.4 ng/ml, p greater than 0.05). At the same time urinary kallikrein decreased from 55 +/- 6 to 33 +/- 4 milliesterase units (mEU)/min (p less than 0.05), while urinary kinin decreased from 3.2 +/- 0.4 to 1.9 +/- 0.3 ng/min (p less than 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the decrease in arterial bradykinin and the rise in SAP induced by RAC (p less than 0.01). Administration of the dipeptidyl hydrolase inhibitor SQ20881 during RAC reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme levels from 578 +/- 86 to 10 +/- 0.0 mU/ml (p less than 0.005). There was an associated increase in arterial bradykinin (1.4 +/- 0.1 to 5.8 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, p less than 0.001), renal venous bradykinin (2.0 +/- 0.4 to 5.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, p less than 0.005), and urinary kinin (1.9 +/- 0.3 to 5.0 +/- 0.7 ng/min, p less than 0.01) in conjunction with return of SAP to control levels. Urinary kallikrein, however, remained depressed following SQ20881 (33 +/- 4 to 30 +/- 5 mEU/min, p greater than 0.05). These results suggest that (1) decreases in circulating BK may potentiate the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II and contribute to the hypertension induced by RAC, and (2) urinary kallikrein is an unreliable marker of changes in plasma bradykinin in this model of hypertension.", 
    "267": "The mechanism(s) for the hypotensive effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors remains elusive. This is because of the multiplicity of the biological actions of angiotensin, the dual role of ACE and the ability of the inhibitors to induce the enzyme. After a single dose of enalapril (MK421), a new ACE inhibitor, in patients with essential hypertension a close linear relationship between the plasma level of enalaprilic acid (MK422) and the degree of ACE inhibition could be demonstrated. Furthermore the degree of ACE inhibition was linearly related to the hormonal changes and to the fall in blood pressure. After chronic administration of enalapril the plasma levels of MK422 were found to be dose dependent. As in the acute study there was also a linear relationship between the plasma level of MK422 and the degree of ACE inhibition. However, the plasma enalaprilic acid level-ACE inhibition dose response curve after chronic administration was shifted to the right, compared to the dose response curve after acute administration suggesting that ACE had been induced during chronic administration of enalapril in humans. There were direct linear relationships between both the degree of ACE inhibition the plasma and enalaprilic acid (MK422) level to the fall in mean arterial pressure. These results suggest that regardless of the final mechanism for the hypotensive action of ACE inhibitors it is a consequence of their inhibition of the enzyme.", 
    "268": "Three pressor systems regulate arterial pressure (MAP): angiotensin II (ANG II), the alpha-adrenergic system, and arginine vasopressin (AVP). In this study we determined the ability of each system to support MAP in the conscious rat when the other two systems were inactivated. After administration of the converting-enzyme inhibitor teprotide (CEI) and the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine (POB), MAP decreased 40% as a result of a 45% decrease in peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). Despite hypotension, plasma AVP levels were not increased, and an AVP pressor antagonist (AVP-A) did not result in a further decrease in MAP. Thus the profound hypotension after POB plus CEI was the result of inhibition of all three systems. POB, rather than CEI, prevented AVP release since following hypotensive hemorrhage, plasma levels reached 51 +/- 13 pg/ml with CEI but only 4.7 +/- 0.8 pg/ml with POB. To study the pressor effect of AVP alone, AVP was infused in POB plus CEI-treated rats. AVP increased MAP (from 68 +/- 4 to 92 +/- 5 mmHg; P less than 0.005) and plasma AVP (to 13.8 +/- 1.9 pg/ml). Since POB inhibited both the AVP and the alpha-adrenergic system, the role of ANG II alone was determined in POB-treated rats. In the presence of ANG II MAP was 97 +/- 1 mmHg. To study the alpha-adrenergic system, MAP was determined in CEI plus AVP-A-treated rats. In the presence of an intact alpha-adrenergic system MAP was 101 +/- 1 mmHg. We conclude that PVR and MAP are profoundly decreased in the absence of all three pressor systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "269": "Of patients with essential hypertension, 30% to 50% do not modulate adrenal and renovascular responsiveness to angiotensin II (AII) with changes in sodium intake. To define the role of AII in mediating these altered responses, the adrenal and renal vascular responses to AII infusion (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 ng/kg/min) were assessed on a sodium-restricted intake in 31 patients with essential hypertension and 13 normotensive controls before and after 72 hours of converting-enzyme inhibition. Forty percent of the hypertensive patients had a subnormal adrenal response to AII. There were no differences between the normal and abnormal responding hypertensive patients in a number of clinical and biochemical factors except that the \"abnormal responders\" had a significantly (p less than 0.03) greater control AII level (37 +/- 3 vs 29 +/- 3 pg/ml) and lower control plasma aldosterone level (14 +/- 2 vs 22 +/- 3 ng/dl) than the \"normal responders.\" When a converting-enzyme inhibitor was administered, no change in adrenal responsiveness to AII occurred in the normotensive controls or the hypertensive normal responders. In the hypertensive abnormal responders, both the threshold sensitivity and the entire dose response curve was significantly (p less than 0.01) enhanced following short-term converting-enzyme inhibition. This increased sensitivity could not be explained by differences in AII increment with AII infusions, in basal aldosterone levels, or in blood pressure or basal AII response to converting-enzyme inhibition. Since they occurred whether captopril or enalapril (MK 421) were used, this phenomenon is likely to be a specific effect of converting-enzyme inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "270": "Performing a sports profile in the hypertensive patient requires a careful assessment of the cardiovascular system. Special attention must be directed to the etiology of the disease as well as to the treatment regimen. Many individuals seeking a sports profile may, in fact, be either unaware of their hypertension or inadequately treated. Insufficient pretesting evaluation of these individuals might well place them at a higher risk for complications of testing. Modification of standard testing procedures would, therefore, be warranted, and in view of the augmented rise in both systolic and diastolic pressure with isometric exercise, avoidance of this form of exercise is advised in the untreated hypertensive patient. Finally, recognizing that antihypertensive medication can adversely affect the hemodynamic response to exercise should permit appropriate application and interpretation of the sports profile.", 
    "271": "The effects of phentolamine, KBIV24 and captopril on the mean arterial blood pressure of normal and treated (dehydration, hemorrhage) frogs were determined. Hemorrhage but not dehydration led to a decrease in MAP. Only phentolamine attentuated MAP in both normal and treated frogs. KBIV24 and captopril were ineffective. It was concluded that the blood pressure of frogs is regulated by catecholamine. Neither arginine vasotocin nor the renin-angiotensin system play any role in blood pressure homeostasis in normal and hypovolemic conditions.", 
    "272": "The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (MK-421), at a dose of 1 mg/kg or more by gavage twice daily, effectively inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I for more than 12 h and less than 24 h. Plasma renin activity (PRA) did not change after 2 or 4 days of treatment at 1 mg/kg twice daily despite effective ACE inhibition, whereas it rose significantly at 10 mg/kg twice daily. Blood pressure fell significantly and heart rate increased in rats treated with 10 mg/kg of enalapril twice daily, a response which was abolished by concomitant angiotensin II infusion. However, infusion of angiotensin II did not prevent the rise in plasma renin. Enalapril treatment did not change urinary immunoreactive prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) excretion and indomethacin did not modify plasma renin activity of enalapril-treated rats. Propranolol significantly reduced the rise in plasma renin in rats receiving enalapril. None of these findings could be explained by changes in the ratio of active and inactive renin. Water diuresis, without natriuresis and with a decrease in potassium urinary excretion, occurred with the higher dose of enalapril. Enalapril did not potentiate the elevation of PRA in two-kidney one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. In conclusion, enalapril produced renin secretion, which was in part beta-adrenergically mediated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "273": "Indomethacin (10 mg kg-1 orally) caused a moderate inhibition of the renal responses to frusemide (30 mg kg-1 orally) only in Na+-deficient rats, suggesting that renal prostaglandins (PG) are necessary for optimal effects of frusemide during Na+ restriction. Captopril (1, 3 and 10 mg kg-1 orally) also inhibited frusemide-induced diuresis and natriuresis in Na+-deficient rats; the large effect of captopril at 10 mg kg-1 was accompanied by arterial hypotension. In normal rats, captopril did not disturb blood pressure or affect the renal effects of frusemide. By comparison, minoxidil (10 and 20 mg kg-1 orally) caused hypotension and reduced the natriuretic effects of frusemide in both normal and low-Na+ states. Since circulating angiotensin II (AII) is a stimulus for PG synthesis during Na+ restriction, it is suggested that captopril may impair the renal responses to frusemide through hormonal and haemodynamic changes resulting from inhibition of A II formation.", 
    "274": "Three patients with Takayasu's disease (TD), initially observed with hypertension and/or congestive heart failure, were treated with captopril, an orally active inhibitor of converting enzyme. As arteritis in this disease is diffuse and extensive, surgical correction of renovascular hypertension is often delayed or impossible. Our experience enables us to recommend captopril for conservative treatment in TD.", 
    "275": "We report here on the extraction and characterization of angiotensin I (ANG I) and angiotensin II (ANG II) from the brain of rats. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with different mobile phases combined with specific radioimmunoassays (RIA) proved to be a powerful tool for peptide characterization in biological samples; (Ile5)-ANG I, (Ile5)-ANG II and (Ile5)-ANG III could clearly be identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), incubated in vivo and in vitro with renin, in total brain extracts, as well as in hypothalamus (HT), medulla oblongata (MO), cerebellum (CER) and cortex (CO). Angiotensin cleaved from CSF angiotensinogen and angiotensin extracted from brain showed retention times identical to those of plasma angiotensin and synthetic standard peptides, indicating that their amino acid sequence is probably identical. ANG I and ANG II were highest in the HT and lowest in the CO. Following bilateral nephrectomy (NX) both ANG I and ANG II persisted at control levels. Young 10 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) showed significantly lower ANG I and ANG II concentrations in the HT compared with Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril caused a significant increase in ANG 1 in nephrectomized SHRSP but not in WKY. These differences were not found in 40 week old SHRSP. The data show that ANG I and ANG II are synthetized in the brain of rats. The lower concentrations and the enhanced accumulation of ANG I after converting enzyme blockade in nephrectomized young SHRSP indicate an increased turnover of angiotensin in hypertensive rats.", 
    "276": "The extent to which beta-adrenergic receptor mediated renin release contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure during hypotension induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 40 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min) was assessed in conscious Wistar rats fitted with chronic aortic and vena caval catheters. Propranolol, (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.), reduced the basal level of plasma renin activity (PRA) in control rats from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 2.4 +/- 0.4 ng angiotensin I/ml/min (p less than .05) and decreased PRA obtained during SNP infusion from 35.3 +/- 6.6 to 16.7 +/- 2.2 ng angiotensin I/ml/min (p less than .01). Despite the reduced PRA, the hypotensive response to SNP was not enhanced after propranolol. Treatment of these animals with captopril in order to block the actions of the remaining non-beta-receptor released renin, resulted in augmentation of the SNP hypotension. Captopril also potentiated SNP hypotension in rats that had not received propranolol. The addition of propranolol to the captopril treated rats produced no further change in SNP hypotension. The results of this study indicate that beta-receptor-mediated and beta-receptor-independent mechanisms contribute to the renin released during SNP hypotension. However, if the beta-receptor-mediated component alone is blocked, the remaining renin secretion is adequate to maintain blood pressure during SNP infusion.", 
    "277": "The synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate (TDP; Asp-arg-val-tyr-ile-his-pro-phe-his-leu-leu-val-tyr-ser) has been employed frequently to elucidate the enzymatic action of renin in vitro and, to a lesser extent, in vivo. We assessed the utility of TDP as a renin substrate in vivo using conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. Intravenous injection of TDP (1 and 3 micrograms/kg) increased diastolic pressure by 45 +r2 and 67 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively. The pressor response to TDP was significantly inhibited by captopril (3 mg/kg, po), indicating its dependence on conversion by ACE to some active molecule. Pressor responses to TDP also were less in animals subjected to bilateral nephrectomy 18-24 hr before study. However, responses to angiotensin I and II also were reduced, implying a non-specific effect of nephrectomy. Intravenous infusion of the renin inhibitor pepstatin (200 micrograms/min) inhibited pressor responses to hog renin by approximately 60%, but did not affect those to TDP. Intravenous infusion of the water soluble renin inhibitor, pepstatinyl-arginine-o-methyl ester (500 micrograms/min), also inhibited pressor responses to renin (approx. 80%) and did not affect those of TDP. Incubation to TDP (5 microM) with rabbit lung ACE resulted in generation of AI that was blocked by captopril (1 microM). These data suggest that TDP is a substrate for ACE and that the increase in blood pressure produced by TDP is due to its sequential cleavage by ACE to AII and can be independent of renin.", 
    "278": "Neuroblastoma cells (N1E-115) and glial cells possess aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl carboxypeptidases and dipeptidyl aminopeptidases, which are located in the plasma membranes. Neuronal cells possess angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which splits the Gly-Phe bond and generates Tyr-Gly-Gly from enkephalin. They have no enkephalinase A. In contrast, glial cells possess enkephalinase A but no ACE. Not only the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidases on neuronal and glial cells are different. These cells have aminopeptidases which have to be distinguished as well. This differentiation is made by using bestatin as an aminopeptidase inhibitor and reveals peptidases of high and poor bestatin-sensitivity.", 
    "279": "Enalapril is the result of a targeted research programme to develop a non-mercapto converting enzyme inhibitor with a long duration of action and an improved safety profile for use in the therapy of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Over 3500 patients world-wide have received enalapril or enalaprilat. Long-term experience at present includes over 2500 patients. While enalapril and captopril produce similar efficacy, enalapril is better tolerated and appears not to be associated with occurrence of captopril-type side-effects, particularly the skin rash, taste loss, leukopenia and proteinuria. Enalapril and other converting enzyme inhibitors may be associated with renal insufficiency when given to patients with bilateral renovascular hypertension.", 
    "280": "Brachial artery haemodynamics, including arterial diameter, blood flow velocity, blood flow and compliance of the brachial artery may be evaluated non-invasively in man, using pulsed Doppler methods. In patients with sustained untreated essential hypertension, brachial artery diameter is increased, blood flow is normal and arterial compliance is reduced independently of the level of blood pressure. Converting enzyme inhibition may reverse the large artery abnormalities, causing an increase in arterial diameter, blood flow and arterial compliance both in acute and long-term investigations. These changes in large arteries may contribute towards improved cardiovascular morbidity and less mortality in treated hypertensive patients.", 
    "281": "Enalapril lowers blood pressure both acutely and during long-term therapy in patients with essential hypertension. After a single 10 mg dose of enalapril a close relationship between plasma enalaprilic acid (MK-422) levels, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and the acute hypotensive and hormonal effects was demonstrated. During long-term administration of enalapril, a similar relationship between the plasma enalaprilic acid level, ACE inhibition and the hypotensive effect was shown, although the dose-response curve for plasma enalaprilic acid to ACE inhibition was displaced to the right compared to the acute dose-response curve. Several weeks' administration of enalapril was needed to reach stable plateau levels of plasma enalaprilic acid and ACE inhibition. During long-term treatment with enalapril in essential hypertension, there was sustained inhibition of ACE and the associated hormonal changes.", 
    "282": "Enalapril maleate is a prodrug which when administered orally is hydrolysed to release the active converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. Enalapril maleate is 60% absorbed and 40% bioavailable as enalaprilat. Both compounds undergo renal excretion without further metabolism. The functional half-life for accumulation of enalaprilat is 11 h, and this is increased in the presence of a reduction in renal function. Inhibition of converting enzyme inhibition is associated with reductions in plasma angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone, and with increases in plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin I. Acute and chronic effects have been reviewed. When given with hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril attenuates the secondary aldosteronism and ameliorates the hypokalaemia from diuretics. Both acutely and chronically in patients with essential hypertension, enalapril reduced blood pressure with a rather flat dose-response curve. No evidence of a triphasic response such as seen with captopril has been demonstrated with enalapril, and blood pressure returns smoothly to pretreatment levels when the drug is abruptly discontinued. Once- or twice-daily dosing gives similar results. The antihypertensive effects of enalapril are potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide. Haemodynamically, blood pressure reduction is associated with a reduced peripheral vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac output and stroke volume with little change in heart rate. Renal vascular resistance decreases, and renal blood flow may increase without an increase in glomerular filtration in patients with normal renal function. In patients with essential hypertension and glomerular filtration rates below 80 ml/min/m2, both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rates may increase.", 
    "283": "The effect of oral treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on sodium homeostasis was investigated in the rat. Treatment by enalapril prior to and during a 6 day period following abrupt suppression of dietary Na+ was associated with a sodium wasting state (urinary Na+ always exceeded intake during the observation period) and blunting by 90% of the aldosterone response to Na+ restriction In rats on chronic low Na+ intake, enalapril produced a slight, transient natriuresis together with a marked increase in drinking volume. In Na+ replete rats, enalapril had no influence on sodium balance. Converting enzyme inhibition markedly impaired the systemic and renal response to Na restriction and enalapril had no natriuretic effect in the Na+ replete state.", 
    "284": "To appreciate the advantages of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system in the treatment of hypertension it is necessary to be aware of four major failures in today's therapy of the disease: The theoretical blood pressure target (supine diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 95 mmHg) is not reached in every patient. The number of adverse effects affecting the quality of life is not acceptable. Today's antihypertensive medications have no basic physiological rationale. Although the mechanical risks of blood pressure elevation are avoided with today's therapy, coronary heart disease, the most common cardiac complication, is not significantly reduced. Converting enzyme inhibition could theoretically provide a solution to each of these failures but its advantages will have to be balanced against the potential risks. The risk of iatrogenic disease with any compound introduced chronically into a living organism for therapeutic reasons. The lack of substrate specificity and the unknown overall physiological effect of angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "285": "Enalapril, a novel long acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was given orally to 12 patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA functional class III and IV) and cardiomegaly. The optimal dose averaged 17 mg given once-daily. Heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, right and left ventricular filling pressures and cardiac index were monitored during dose efficacy titration. Eleven patients were recatheterised 3 months later. After stabilisation of cardiac filling pressures, all patients had left ventricular filling pressures in excess of 20 mmHg. Enalapril increased cardiac index acutely by 34% but at 12 weeks follow-up, cardiac index was not different from control levels. Left ventricular filling pressure was reduced acutely by 36% and by 41% at 3 months. Heart rate, systemic arterial and right atrial pressures and plasma concentrations of aldosterone were reduced during the observation period. ACE activity was inhibited at the time of peak haemodynamic effect from 25.3 +/- 9.8 to 4.9 +/- 3.4 U/ml (P less than 0.01). Renin was markedly elevated. These changes were accompanied by marked and sustained clinical improvement and subjective well-being.", 
    "286": "Serum MK-422 and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity were measured during the introduction of enalapril therapy in eight patients with heart failure. In a second study of 16 patients, we recorded exercise tolerance, clinical status and haemodynamics before and after 12 weeks of placebo or enalapril treatment. Increasing doses of enalapril gave step-wise increments in serum MK-422. Plasma converting enzyme activity remained low for at least 24 h after each dose of enalapril (5, 10 and 20 mg). Compared to placebo patients (n = 8), those receiving enalapril (n = 8) tended to improve their exercise performance and clinical status, and showed a fall in right heart pressures after 12 weeks of treatment.", 
    "287": "Captopril, the first orally effective converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered to 14 patients with chronic heart failure for 6 week periods, in a double-blind crossover comparison with placebo. Captopril improved symptoms and exercise performance, while left ventricular internal dimensions were reduced. The fall in blood pressure induced by captopril was well tolerated. Glomerular filtration rate was reduced and effective renal plasma flow increased on captopril. No decline in body weight or total body sodium was seen, suggesting that a natriuresis had not occurred. Serum and total body potassium rose. Ventricular arrhythmias declined.", 
    "288": "Male rats were orally administered an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), N-[(S)-1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-1-ala-1-pro maleate (enalapril, MK-0421) at dosage levels of 10, 30, and 90 mg/kg X d. After 2-6 wk of dosing, the rats receiving 30 and 90 mg/kg X d produced large numbers of seminal plugs and had lacerated penises due to licking in an attempt to recover urine. Providing 0.9% saline as the source of drinking water prevented this behavior and subsequent lesions. There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance. A subsequent study showed that enalapril at 5 mg/kg X d po and captopril (another ACE inhibitor) at 25 mg/kg X d po increased NaCl intake in rats. Our results with captopril confirm those of Fregly (1980) and Evered and Robinson (1983) and show that both converting-enzyme inhibitors (enalapril and captopril) increase salt appetite in rats.",

Serum levels of the active metabolite M 1 (dicarboxylic acid) of HOE 498 were measured by HPLC up to 14 days after a single oral dose of 10 mg HOE 498. Peak serum concentration of M 1 between 5-50 ng/ml was observed 1.5-3.0 h after administration. The serum concentration-time curve of M 1 was polyphasic and exhibited a prolonged terminal phase with a half-life of approximately 110 h. Despite the long terminal half-life M 1 could not be detected in urine later than 72 h after administration. The activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme in plasma was completely suppressed for up to 12 h, and 72 h after dosing 50% inhibition of the enzyme was still observed.",

Hoe 498 was tolerated well. 9 out of 20 patients responded to 1 mg b.i.d., the blood pressure in a further 5 patients normalized with 2 mg b.i.d. Six patients did not respond to Hoe 498 treatment (4 mg b.i.d. in the last week) according to the criterion: recumbent diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg.

Following 5 mg Hoe 498 plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was inhibited by almost 100% up to 8 h. A marked effect on plasma ACE was observed for more than 8 days. Plasma renin activity increased whereas aldosterone plasma levels decreased only slightly. Sodium and potassium excretion was not influenced by the compound. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was slightly lowered by Hoe 498, whereas no relevant changes in pulse rate were observed.",

The radioactivity disappeared from the blood in one or two phases with half-lives of 0.6 h in the rat, 1/3.8 h in dog and 0.5/2.9 h in man. Studies in rats have shown that the radioactivity is distributed rapidly to all tissues. Markedly higher concentrations than in the blood were found in the liver, kidneys, and particularly in the lungs. The elimination from the lungs, which showed the highest concentrations until 5 d after administration, occurred with a half-life of 63 h. In rats, 26% of the dose was excreted with the urine and 71% with the feces. About one third of the dose was eliminated with the bile and about 13% was reabsorbed from the bile. The excretion in the breast milk of rats was low. Placental transfer in pregnant rats was low and transient. The radioactivity recovered from the urine of dogs amounted to 15%, that recovered from the feces amounted to 79%. In man, 56% of the radioactivity was excreted with the urine and less than 40% with the feces. Whereas in rat urine one metabolite dominates, the metabolite patterns in urine and serum/plasma of man and dog - which are very much alike - reveal a different biotransformation with three main metabolites. Unchanged Hoe 498, as well as its dicarboxylic acid and other metabolites appear only in low concentrations in this pattern.",

Both methods involve extraction from the respective biological fluid using disposable C 18 columns. In serum, the enzyme-inhibiting properties of Hoe 498-diacid (Hoe 498 can readily be converted to its hydrolysis product) are utilized for the determination of both compounds concurrently. The serum extract is dissolved in buffer solution and incubated with human serum as angiotensin converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptide-hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) source and hip-his-leu substrate. The hippuric acid liberated is quantitated by HPLC. The urine extract is treated with diazomethane followed by trifluoroacetic anhydride to convert Hoe 498 and Hoe 498-diacid to their methylester, trifluoroacetyl derivatives, which are then determined simultaneously by GLC using a nitrogen specific detector.",

Oral treatment with one single dose of the CE inhibitors Hoe 498 (1 mg/kg) and enalapril (30 mg/kg) in normotensive rats produced up to 24 h CE inhibition in plasma, aorta, heart and brain cortex and a 48 h inhibition of the enzyme in kidney and lung. In SHRSP, four-week oral treatment with Hoe 498 (0.1, 1, 10 mg/kg/day) and enalapril (1, 10, 30 mg/kg/day) lowered arterial blood pressure dose-dependently, with normalization of blood pressure following the respective highest dose. Plasma CE activity was inhibited during treatment with both drugs and increased or normal after drug withdrawal, while blood pressure remained decreased for 2-3 weeks post treatment. After 4 weeks of Hoe 498 (3 mg/kg/day) in SHRSP blood pressure was normalized and CE activity was markedly reduced in plasma, lung, kidney, aorta, mesenteric artery, heart, hypophysis and medulla oblongata. The CE inhibition persisted for one week in the kidney and mesenteric artery, accompanying the persistent post treatment blood pressure reduction. Our results demonstrate the strong antihypertensive potency of Hoe 498 in SHRSP and strengthen the hypothesis that CE inhibition in target tissues such as kidney and vascular wall is an important factor involved in the antihypertensive action of CE inhibitors.",

The hemodynamic profile of Hoe 498 in anesthetized animals was characterized by a reduction in systemic blood pressure which was associated with a decrease in total peripheral and renal vascular resistance. These effects were enhanced upon sodium depletion. In conscious normotensive rats a single oral administration of Hoe 498 reduced systemic blood pressure for more than 5 h. The development of acute renovascular hypertension in anesthetized rats was prevented by oral pretreatment with Hoe 498. In conscious rats with renovascular hypertension (two-kidney, one clip) single oral doses of Hoe 498 induced a long lasting antihypertensive effect. Chronic oral treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with Hoe 498 lowered arterial blood pressure more effectively than enalapril. The threshold antihypertensive dose for Hoe 498 was 0.01 mg/kg/d, for enalapril 1 mg/kg/d. In conscious hypertensive dogs (two-kidney, two wrapped) Hoe 498 at a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg reduced systemic blood pressure for more than 6 h. Oral administration of Hoe 498 in a dose of 1 mg/kg/d for 5 d normalized systemic blood pressure in conscious hypertensive dogs. These findings demonstrate that in various models of experimental hypertension the novel orally active converting enzyme inhibitor Hoe 498 exerts marked cardiovascular and potent prolonged antihypertensive activities, which merit exploration with respect to possible therapeutic benefits.",

Designed as a prodrug to improve the bioavailability Hoe 498 has to be deesterified to its active moiety Hoe 498-diacid to develop full inhibitory potency. The present study compares the basic pharmacological properties of Hoe 498 in rats and dogs to those of enalapril. In vitro assays revealed equal potency of both Hoe 498-diacid and enalaprilat. In vivo the inhibitory potency was judged by the ability to attenuate the pressor response induced by angiotensin I. The results indicate that Hoe 498 was approximately 10 times more potent than enalapril after oral intake in conscious rats or after intraduodenal administration in anaesthetized rats, whereas after intravenous injection both compounds exhibited equal potency. Hoe 498 was at least twice as potent as enalapril after oral or intraduodenal administration in dogs but about 4 times more potent than enalapril after intravenous injection. In conclusion, the obtained data point to a prodrug pathway for Hoe 498 which should be advantageous with regard to bioavailability, onset and duration of action and therefore promises to be favourable in the treatment of different cardiovascular diseases.",

Hoe 498 diacid inhibits ACE with a Ki value of 7 pmol/l. It is both a slow-and tight-binding inhibitor; the mode of inhibition is fully competitive. Binding of Hoe 498 diacid to ACE proceeds by a two-step mechanism E+I in equilibrium EI in equilibrium EI* in which the inhibitor rapidly binds to enzyme to form an initial enzyme-inhibitor complex which then undergoes a slow isomerization. The interaction of Hoe 498 diacid with ACE is compared to that of the two other potent inhibitors, captopril and enalaprilat.",

Using hip-his-leu as substrate, the IC50-values for Hoe 498 and its diacid derivative were 26 or 4.2 nmol/l, respectively. Hoe 498 acts as a prodrug. It is hydrolyzed by an esterase into its active diacid derivative. Sera contain high esterase activities. In comparison to sera from man, dog and rabbit, rat sera have the highest esterase activity.

    "300": "The important role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the maintenance of high blood pressure in certain forms of hypertension is well established. Inhibition of the RAS has therefore been studied with the aim to develop antihypertensive agents. Pharmacologic interferences with the RAS are possible at all steps of the formation, action and degradation of angiotensin II (ANG II). Renin activity can be inhibited by peptide analogues of angiotensinogen, peptides derived from the amino terminal sequence of pro-renin, inhibitors of acid proteases (pepstatin) and by specific renin antibodies. Inhibitors of the converting enzyme also prevent the formation of ANG II. ANG II receptor blockers (saralasin) prevent the action of the effector peptide of the RAS at the target cells. While some modes of intervention are still theoretical or experimental possibilities, others, e.g. inhibition of converting enzyme, are already used clinically for antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "301": "The enzyme renin splits a single peptide bond in the plasma glycoprotein angiotensinogen liberating the biologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (ANG I). A second enzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme (CE), releases the strong vasoconstricting octapeptide ANG II via degradation of a C-terminal dipeptide. The effect of this compound on blood pressure can be attenuated by interference with the enzyme-controlled peptide cascade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This is accomplished by inhibition of renin and CE, respectively. Orally active CE inhibitors are valuable drugs in the treatment of renal and essential hypertension and of heart failure. Strong inhibitors of renin have also been synthesized, however, peptide moieties which have still to be present in these compounds impede oral absorption. Finally, antagonistic analogues of ANG II are able to block its effect on the receptor level. Their application is limited by the still existing partial agonistic activity.",

After a 2-week period on placebo, drug dosages in the two groups were adjusted to individual needs until blood pressure was normalized (diastolic less than 90 mmHg). Patients in Group I received 10 to 40 mg enalapril/day; those in Group II received 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide plus 80 to 240 mg propranolol/day. Echocardiographic measurements were made at the end of the placebo and 26-week active treatment periods. Significant correlations were observed between the changes in four pairs of variables in each group. In the 8 patients receiving enalapril, there were negative correlations between interventricular septal thickness and supine systolic blood pressure, erect and supine heart rates, and a positive correlation between relative wall thickness and erect diastolic blood pressure. In the 7 patients on hydrochlorothiazide plus propranolol, there were negative correlations between relative wall thickness and erect and supine heart rate, and positive correlations between left ventricular mass and erect diastolic blood pressure, and the percentage change in internal diameter of the left ventricle and supine systolic blood pressure. Possible explanations for and implications of these regional changes are discussed.",

    "304": "The hemodynamic and humoral effects of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and nifedipine, a calcium-entry blocker, were evaluated in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rats received enalapril (5 mg/kg, po) or vehicle, followed in one hour by nifedipine (2.5 mg/kg, ip) or its vehicle. After treatment with enalapril alone, systolic blood pressure (BP) declined over a 3 hour period from 204 +/- 4 (mean +/- SE) to 168 +/- 6 mm Hg and remained suppressed for an additional 4 hours. Heart rate (HR) did not change. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased approximately 9-fold and serum ACE was maximally inhibited. BP response to nifedipine was more rapid, greater in magnitude (-59 +/- 6 mm Hg) and shorter in duration; heart rate increased and remained elevated for 2.5 hours. PRA only rose two-fold. After the drugs in combination, BP declined as rapidly and to the same degree as after nifedipine and remained reduced for a longer duration. Treatment with enalapril attenuated the reflex tachycardia observed after nifedipine. These data suggest that coadministration of an ACE inhibitor and calcium-entry blocker may provide better blood pressure control than either drug class alone and at the same time prevent the reflex tachycardia frequently observed after nifedipine.", 
    "305": "A spectrofluorimetric method was adapted for determination of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) in untreated native cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanyl-histidyl-leucine was applied as enzyme substrate. The biochemical behavior of ACE of CSF (CACE) was studied. The pH optimum was found to be 8.0 using borax phosphate buffer. The determination of Km was 10.7 +/- 3.3 (SD) mumol/l. ACE could be blocked by 8-hydroxyquinoline (100%) and phenanthroline (80%), but only slight inhibition was observed by teprotide (43%), EDTA (40%) and captopril (31%). The influence of various drugs on CACE was also tested. The different biochemical behavior of CACE compared to serum ACE suggested that an isoenzyme exists in CSF. CACE has been found to be elevated in neuroimmunological and inflammatory disorders of the nervous system compared to levels in healthy controls.",

The systolic blood pressure before captopril was elevated in patients in the forties (p less than 0,01) when compared to the younger patients and was positively correlated to the age before (r = 0.32, p less than 0.05) and after (r = 0.32, p less than 0,05) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril 25 mg. the drop in systolic (-13%) and diastolic (-10%) blood pressure was significantly greater in patients in the fifties (p less than 0,025 and p less than 0,05 respectively) when compared to younger and older (p less than 0,1) patients. The response of plasma renin activity paralleled the blood pressure response, while heart rate after captopril was not significantly changed in any group. The lack of age dependence of the blood pressure response to captopril and of reflex tachycardia suggests converting enzyme inhibition to be a valuable adjunct for the treatment of essential hypertension in the elderly.", 
    "307": "In a 36-year-old woman with malignant hypertension and moderate renal insufficiency from nephrosclerosis normotension was not achieved by the combination of a beta-blocker, a vasodilator, and a loop-diuretic. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril was then added to the therapy. The blood pressure control was good. However, due to adverse reactions, captopril had to be withdrawn. Later on, the patient was successfully treated with enalapril, another ACE inhibitor, without the relapse of any adverse reactions.", 
    "308": "The efficacy and tolerability of the new ACE-inhibitor enalapril (MK 421) and the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker atenolol for the treatment of primary hypertension were compared in a double blind parallel study. 12 patients were randomized to each drug. The doses of enalapril were 20 and 40 mg o.d. and of atenolol 50 and 100 mg o.d. for 4 weeks each, whereafter hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 or 50 mg o.d. was added if necessary to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) less than 90 mm Hg 24 hours after drug intake. Supine BP was reduced from 160 +/- 7/111 +/- 4 mm Hg to 153 +/- 13/101 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.05/p less than 0.005) with enalapril and from 163 +/- 17/109 +/- 6 mm Hg to 145 +/- 11/95 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.005/p less than 0.001) with atenolol. The addition of HCTZ caused a profound additive BP reduction to 132 +/- 7/88 +/- 6 mm Hg with enalapril and to 130 +/- 10/88 +/- 7 mm Hg with atenolol. There was no significant difference between the efficacy of enalapril and atenolol alone or combined with HTCZ. The reduction in mean arterial pressure with enalapril tended to correlate with pre-treatment stimulated plasma renin activity and 24 hours urinary kallikrein excretion. Both drugs tended to reduce serum and urinary aldosterone and kallikrein excretion to the same extent. There was one drop-out in each group, one due to impotence on the combination of enalapril and HCTZ and one due to peripheral coldness during atenolol treatment. Other side effects were mild. No toxic adverse effects were registered.", 
    "309": "Twelve males with moderately severe essential hypertension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] ranging 113-162 mmHg) were studied at rest supine and sitting and during bicycle exercise (50, 100 and 150 W). Intraarterial blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded continuously. Cardiac output (CO) was measured by dye dilution (Cardiogreen). After 6-8 months (enalapril dose 10-40 mg daily) patients were restudied. BP fell in all patients, at rest sitting from 184/107 mmHg to 150/87 (-19%) and during 100 W from 223/117 to 194/98 mmHg (p less than 0.001). Pretreatment total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) was greatly increased in all patients and fell from 4137 to 3651 dyn s cm-5 m2 (-16%) (p less than 0.05). No significant changes were seen in CO, HR or stroke volume. No side effects were seen. It is concluded that enalapril reduces BP in patients with moderately severe hypertension at rest and during exercise due to reduction in TPRI without significant changes in CO or HR.", 
    "310": "After a run-in period on placebo, 15 patients with primary hypertension got antihypertensive treatment with enalapril in single therapy during six weeks. Before and four hours after drug administration simultaneous non-invasive recordings of ECG, phonocardiogram and carotid pulse tracing or apexcardiogram or impedance cardiogram were made. After six weeks' therapy the recordings were repeated 12 hours and four hours after dose intake. The results showed enalapril to be a potent antihypertensive agent with considerable effect already four hours after the first dose intake. The blood pressure reduction was explained by a decrease in total peripheral resistance, semiquantitatively measured with impedance cardiography. Cardiac output was significantly higher during long-term treatment than before therapy started, due to a significant increase in stroke volume. Lef ventricular (LV) diastolic function was not altered but a considerable improvement in LV systolic function was achieved as judged from the systolic time intervals. Open questioning regarding side effects indicated good tolerance.", 
    "311": "The angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was administrated to 15 renal transplant patients for a minimum period of 14 weeks after transplantation. The object was to decrease ischaemic damage caused by secondary activation of the renal renin-angiotensin system after rejection and associated vascular damage. Captopril patients had lower s-creatinine values than controls in the immediate phase after rejection. On the other hand, after 14 weeks renal perfusion was better, but glomerular filtration rate lower in the captopril group than in the control group. However, none of the differences were significant. Renal function was examined during captopril administration, which may have affected the results. Final evaluation of this trial requires extended follow-up. Captopril was well tolerated in the low doses used (37.5-75 mg daily) in spite of varying degrees of renal failure and concomitant azathioprine administration. Only one case of mild leukopenia was recorded, which improved immediately after captopril interruption. No other serious side effects were observed. Captopril may be safely administered to renal transplant patients, if monitoring of renal function and possible side effects is carried through.", 
    "312": "In three unilaterally nephrectomized patients with a poorly functioning remaining kidney, a reversible decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was observed during treatment with captopril. Only modest decreases in blood pressure occurred. In four patients with various forms of malignant hypertension and impairment of renal function, GFR remained unchanged or even increased when the blood pressure was reduced by captopril. All patients had increased plasma concentrations of renin and angiotensin II prior to captopril. We hypothesize that an activation of the renin-angiotensin system in hypertensive patients with reduced GFR may either reflect a compensatory mechanism aiming at maintaining renal function, or imply an excessive angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction causing a decrease in renal function. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be damaging for renal function in the first situation and beneficial in the second.", 
    "313": "Fourteen patients with hypertension of presumed renovascular etiology were studied by renal vein catheterization. Unilateral renin secretion was found in 8 patients. In 4 of these patients a positive veno-arterial difference of plasma angiotensin I concentration (PAI) across the affected kidney increased markedly after a single dose of captopril. Across the contralateral kidney the net veno-arterial PAI difference changed from about zero before captopril to clearly negative values after captopril. The PAI values in the remaining 4 patients, who were already on captopril before the catheterization, were similar to those observed after a single dose of captopril. In patients with bilateral renin secretion the renal veno-arterial PAI differences across the kidneys were positive or close to zero before captopril. After captopril both positive and negative veno-arterial differences of PAI were observed. The plasma angiotensin II concentrations decreased after captopril to low values. These low values together with extremely high PAI values demonstrate effective ACE-inhibition. A high generation rate of angiotensin I in the affected kidney in patients with unilateral renin secretion after captopril is probably explained by activation of the local renin secretion. The angiotensin I \"consumption\" in the contralateral kidney after captopril in spite of no angiotensin II formation suggests the presence of alternative degradation processes for angiotensin I in the human kidney.", 
    "314": "The cerebrovascular effects of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were examined after intravenous or intracerebroventricular administration in normotensive and hypertensive rats. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using the intracarotid 133xenom method in halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthetised animals. Captopril given either way did not influence the absolute value of CBF. The main finding, however, was that following intravenous administration of captopril at a dose of 10 mg/kg, both the lower pressure limit of CBF autoregulation were shifted to lower pressure and the autoregulatory plateau shortened. The lower limit was shifted 20-30 mm Hg, the upper limit 50-60 mm Hg, and the autoregulatory plateau consequently shortened by 20-30 mm Hg. In contrast to the marked effects of intravenous captopril, intracerebroventricular captopril was without effect on CBF autoregulation. The effect of intravenous captopril was thus probably mediated by converting enzyme in the cerebrovascular endothelium.", 
    "315": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is suppressed either by high sodium intake or by high levels of angiotensin II (A II). Therefore in prior studies it has been difficult to sort out the influence on the cardiovascular homeostases of different levels of A II and different levels of sodium in the diet respectively. The present study examines the quantitative effects of A II on mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), electrolyte excretion and hormone secretion in conscious dogs on low, normal and high sodium intake with the endogenous RAS blocked with continuous intravenous infusion of enalapril (MK-421). Fourteen dogs on three different Na diets, low, normal and high (5, 30 and 250 mmol/day), were infused continuously with enalapril, 4 mg/kg/day and studied with superinfused A II at rates of 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 ng/kg/min., each period lasting one week. Converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) decreased MABP equally in dogs on low and normal sodium intake to about 80% of control, but did not have a significant effect in dogs on high sodium intake. The initial infusion of angiotensin II at the lowest rate had a pronounced effect on MABP in the normal and high sodium states, but had no effect on MABP in the sodium depleted dogs. However, at the higher rates of infusion, the angiotensin II increased the pressure to a similar degree at all levels of sodium intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "316": "The effects of two angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors on the kallikrein-kinin system and prostanoids were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The doses of captopril were 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg X day given twice daily, and those of CI-906 20 and 40 mg/kg once daily. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing the systolic blood pressure. Captopril increased urine volume dose-dependently (up to 3-fold with the largest dose). Only the larger dose of CI-906 was slightly diuretic. Captopril decreased the 24-h urinary excretion of kallikrein, while the excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was increased markedly and that of T X B2 to a lesser extent. CI-906 had no effect on the 24-h urinary excretion of kallikrein, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and T X B2. Both drugs tended to reduce PGE2 excretion. Captopril and CI-906 did not alter plasma kininogen levels. The marked renal effects of captopril may be caused by a strong local inhibition of converting enzyme in the kidneys. Captopril is mainly excreted unchanged in urine, and it is secreted actively by the proximal tubular cells. CI-906 is eliminated predominantly by biliary excretion. It is also possible that direct stimulation of prostacyclin formation by captopril may be involved in the diuretic action of the drug. However, as it was shown with CI-906, the increase in urine flow and the associated changes in urinary kallikrein and prostanoids are not necessary for the antihypertensive effect caused by the inhibition of converting enzyme.", 
    "317": "We developed a novel assay method for the determination of captopril and enalapril serum concentrations. This method is based on a new principle of enzyme assay, inhibitor binding assay (IBA), recently introduced by us for the measurement of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The assay principle is based on binding of 125I-labelled ACE inhibitor (351A, p-hydroxy-benzamidine derivative of N-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline) to ACE. A competitive IBA was established using captopril as a standard and human serum ACE as a binder. For the assay of captive captopril, 0.1 ml of venous blood was taken into 9.9 ml of ice-cold buffer. Following separation of cells, the supernatant was stored at -20 degrees C until assayed. Tubes containing added serum ACE as a binder, labelled inhibitor, and unknown samples, were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C. Following separation of bound label the content of captopril was read from a standard curve. Results in healthy subjects showed peak blood concentrations ranging from 220 to 1300 ng/ml within 30-60 minutes after a single oral dose of 50 mg captopril, and virtual disappearence of active drug from the blood within 3 hours. About 50% of the measurable active captopril was lost during storage of diluted plasma for one month at -20 degrees C. The assay method is simple and sensitive, and measures active drug only. The present new assay principle may prove convenient and feasible for the assay of captopril and other ACE inhibitors in biological fluids.", 
    "318": "The acute hemodynamic response to captopril (8 patients) and enalapril (8 patients) was evaluated in congestive heart failure patients in NYHA functional class III. All patients had a history of congestive heart failure for more than six months. The results show marked interindividual variations but average values for cardiac output increase and decrease in filling pressures agree with findings in the literature. 6 patients in the captopril group and five in the enalapril group were started on maintenance therapy. One patient in the captopril group deteriorated and underwent a successful heart transplantation and one patient in the enalapril group returned with arrhythmias and hypertension (probably not drug-related) after 48 h of therapy. Our data indicate that activation of the renin-angiotensin system through excessive administration of loop-diuretics is associated with a risk of hypovolemia and thus drug-induced hypotension that deserves special attention when considering converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in congestive heart failure.", 
    "319": "The acute hemodynamic and hormonal effects of the oral angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor MK-521 were assessed over a period of 96 hours in 6 patients with heart failure. This compound is the lysine analogue of enalapril diacid (MK-422) and is biologically active following absorption. Dosages ranging from 1.25 mg to 5.0 mg were administered on days 1 and 3, followed by 48 hours intensive hemodynamic observation. Marked reduction in mean arterial pressure (25.2%), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (47.3%), and systemic vascular resistance (34.5%) was observed. Arterial blood was sampled at frequent intervals for angiotensin I (AI), angiotensin II (AII), plasma renin activity, renin substrate, plasma aldosterone, urinary aldosterone, ACE activity, and serum drug levels. Right atrial blood was sampled simultaneously for AI and AII thus permitting reliable assessment of the degree of pulmonary conversion to angiotensin II. Prolonged inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was confirmed and corresponded to drug concentration. The results indicate hemodynamic efficacy and potent ACE inhibition over a period exceeding 24 hours.", 
    "320": "Acute left ventricular failure was induced in 7 anaesthetized dogs by embolization of the left coronary circulation with 57 micron plastic microspheres. The dogs were then subjected to ACE-inhibition with enalapril. In addition to hemodynamic measurements, tissue blood flow was measured with the radioactive microsphere method. Preliminary results are presented, showing the vasodilatory effects of enalapril to be greatest in stomach, muscle and brain while possibly compromising the renal circulation.", 
    "321": "Captopril treatment was given to 30 children aged 8 months to 16 years (mean age 10.1 years) with renal hypertension when combinations of one or more of betablockers, diuretics, clonidine and hydralazine had failed to reduce blood pressure in the majority of the children. Dosages of captopril varied between 0.5 and 11.0 mg/kg BW, which was combined with furosemide in 15 cases, betablockers in three cases, betablockers and clonidine in two cases. Pretreatment mean plasma renin activity (PRA) was 7.9 (0.8-89.4) ng AT/ml/h in 22 of the 30 children and 59% had more than 2.0 ng AT/ml/h. Blood pressure fell from a mean of 158/109 (range 135/75 - 240/140) mm Hg to a mean of 120/76 (range 110/65 - 150/100) mm Hg. Mean duration time was 10.1 months (1-47 months). Skin rash occurred in three cases and taste disturbance in one case. Falling glomerular filtration rate was observed in two children with diseases of the renal vessels. After withdrawal of captopril renal function returned to the pretreatment level. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition for treatment of hypertension in childhood has proved to be efficient and safe in these 30 children.", 
    "322": "We assessed the antihypertensive and hormonal effects of two new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, enalapril (MK-421) and lisinopril (MK-521) in 22 patients with renovascular hypertension. All patients had angiographically verified renal artery lesions, 3 had bilateral renal artery stenosis and one a stenosis in a single kidney, and the rest had unilateral renal artery stenosis. After placebo treatment for 3 days in hospital, increasing doses from 5 to 40 mg daily, of both ACE-inhibitors were given. Both drugs induced a significant fall in blood pressure (BP). Significant BP reductions were seen after 2 h with a maximum fall for the enalapril group at a dose of 40 mg 4 h after drug intake (mean supine BP decrease - 31/24 mm Hg, standing - 29/16 mmHg). The corresponding maximal BP reductions were for the lisinopril group at a dose of 40 mg o.d. at 6 h: mean supine BP fall - 25/28 mmHg and standing - 33/31 mm Hg. Both drugs significantly inhibited serum ACE to about 5 to 10% of initial values and with a duration for more than 24 h. Both drugs also caused a decrease in plasma-AII levels and also in plasma aldosterone concentrations. There were not toxic effects and no serious side effects. Careful monitoring of biochemical variables showed no significant changes. We conclude that both enalapril and lisinopril are effective and very safe agents for the treatment of renovascular hypertension and with a long duration of action and with very good tolerance.", 
    "323": "Responses in urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion and systolic blood pressure to MK 421, SA 446 or captopril were studied in normotensive rats fed on a regular or a low sodium diet to assess the role of renal kallikrein-kinin system in their hypotensive effect. MK 421, SA 446 or captopril were infused at a rate of 6 mg/kg/day by osmotic minipump implanted intraperitoneally for up to 6 days. The magnitude of fall in systolic blood pressure was greater on a low sodium diet when compared to on a regular diet, whereas the pattern of the fall was similar on both diets. The magnitude of falls in plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentration induced by MK 421, SA 446 and captopril was not significantly different between both regular and low sodium diets. Urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion and sodium excretion were increased during infusion of MK 421, SA 446 or captopril on a low sodium diet, however any significant changes were not found in each of them on a regular diet. The present results suggest that on a low sodium diet the augmented hypotensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the rats might be due to the enhanced renal kallikrein-kinin system in addition to suppressed renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "324": "The role of central angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), in the maintenance of high blood pressure, was examined in unanesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Pressor and dipsogenic responses induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of angiotensin I (AI) were elicited before and 30 min after either captopril (120-800 nanomoles ICV), enalapril (66-460 nanomoles ICV) and enalaprilic acid (70-280 nanomoles ICV). Enalapril was 1.6 (0.7-3.9) and 1.7 (0.9-2.9) times more potent than captopril in inhibiting AI-induced pressor and dipsogenic responses, respectively. Enalaprilic acid was 2.7 (1.1-7.1) and 2.9 (1.9-4.8) times more potent than captopril in inhibiting AI- (ICV administration) induced pressor and dipsogenic responses, respectively. None of the ACE inhibitors, in contrast, reduced the central actions of AII. Basal mean arterial pressure was not reduced by these ACE inhibitors after ICV administration. Administered orally at doses which produced similar hypotensive responses, neither captopril (30 mg/kg) nor enalapril (3 mg/kg) blocked the responses induced by AI given ICV (10 ng). These findings indicate that ACE inhibitors given acutely do not penetrate into the central nervous system sufficiently to block the dipsogenic and pressor responses induced by AI given ICV, and suggest that inhibition of central ACE may not be important to the acute antihypertensive activity of the ACE inhibitors tested.", 
    "325": "The design origins of the potent non-mercapto angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors enalaprilat and its mono ethyl ester enalapril are described. Lactam analogues of enalaprilat have provided some insight into the conformation of this inhibitor when it is bound to converting enzyme. X-ray crystallographic studies of a related enzyme/inhibitor complex offer an explanation for the high potency and specificity of these and related inhibitors.", 
    "326": "The normal heart has the capacity to either augment or reduce its mass in relation to long-term alterations in hemodynamic and metabolic demands. However, once cardiac hypertrophy is established, as in hypertensive heart disease, it is less clear whether the augmented mass can revert to normal with control of arterial pressure. In experimental models in which systemic hypertension is induced in genetically normotensive animals, left ventricular weight generally returns toward normal with the removal of the inciting stimulus for the hypertension. However, when arterial pressure control is achieved by pharmacologic therapy, and the inciting stimulus (mechanical or genetic) is intact, the results of pressure reduction on ventricular weight are much more variable than that observed with the removal of a mechanical stimulus for hypertension. It is hypothesized that pharmacologic pressure reduction elicits secondary adjustments in cardiorenal and neurohumoral function which have important influences on ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "327": "The usefulness of captopril in managing hypertensive emergencies was evaluated in 9 untreated patients. During the 30 minutes following oral administration of 25 mg of this angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, blood pressure decreased from 239/134 to 204/118 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). At that time, furosemide (20 mg i.v. or 40 mg orally) had to be added in 5 patients to further decrease pressure levels. Ninety to 120 minutes after starting therapy, an additional dose of captopril (100 mg orally) was given to all patients. 12 and 24 hours after admission respectively, blood pressure averaged 140/93 and 139/86 mm Hg in the patients treated with captopril alone and 166/107 and 153/91 mm Hg in those treated with both captopril and furosemide. The blood pressure fall was well tolerated and no adverse effect was induced by captopril. These results show that captopril given alone or in association with a diuretic makes it possible to deal quickly and effectively with hypertensive crises without necessarily requiring monitoring in an intensive care unit.", 
    "328": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme, or kininase II, is a zinc metallo-enzyme; the cation forms part of its active site. The enzyme transforms angiotensin I into angiotensin II and hydrolyses bradykinin into inactive peptides. Antihypertensive diuretics may decrease the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme by increasing urinary zinc excretion. Captopril inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme, but also affects electrolyte excretion and should be reassessed as a possible first-choice antihypertensive agent in the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "329": "The anticancer drug bis-chloronitrosourea (BCNU) causes potentially life-threatening lung injury in a high percentage of patients. Because changes in the activities of pulmonary and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) have been reported previously to reflect toxic pulmonary damage by certain agents, we have investigated the effects of BCNU on pulmonary and serum ACE of rats. In vitro, BCNU had a direct inhibitory effect on both serum ACE and pulmonary ACE. In vivo, a large single dose of BCNU (80 mg/kg, i.p.) did not alter pulmonary ACE nor cause histologically observable acute lung damage. However, serum ACE dropped by 25% within 1 hr after drug. A multi-dose regimen, consisting of 5 mg BCNU/kg once per week for 6 weeks, caused marked pulmonary injury, which continued to develop in severity over several weeks following the completion of dosing. Lung ACE after four doses (total of 20 mg BCNU/kg) was depressed by 40% and remained low until dosing was completed. Following the final dose, lung ACE returned to control within 2 weeks. However, after an additional 2 weeks both lung and serum ACE had decreased by 35 and 25% respectively. It appears that ACE may provide a useful biochemical monitor for BCNU-induced pulmonary toxicity, but careful attention must be given to the time-course of changes in the enzyme activity.", 
    "330": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) was purified to homogeneity from porcine kidney in order to determine whether iodobradykinins bind to the enzyme and, if so, whether pGlu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gin-Ile-Pro-Pro, SQ20881, a competitive ACE inhibitor, changes the conformation of the enzyme in such a way that it binds kinins with an affinity and specificity expected of a bradykinin (BK) receptor, i.e. where the BK potentiating action of SQ20881 involves an increase in the number of BK receptors due to a conformational change in ACE. 125I-Labeled derivatives of [Tyr1]-kallidin and [Tyr-8]-bradykinin bound to the EDTA-inhibited enzyme, and binding was inhibited by nonradioactive BK. [125I-Tyr5]-BK was not bound by the enzyme. Specificity of [125I-Tyr5]-kallidin (T1K) binding was tested with forty-eight BK analogs, and the concentrations of analogs that inhibited 50% of T1K binding were determined. BK at 1.6 +/- 0.3 X 10(-8) M inhibited 505 of T1K binding. In addition, the concentrations of analogs that decreased by 50% the rate of [3H]-Hip-Gly-Gly ([3H]-HGG) hydrolysis by ACE were assessed. BK at 1.2 +/- 0.2 X 10(-6) M decreased the rate of [3H]-HGG hydrolysis by 50%. A comparison between these concentrations of analogs for inhibition of T1K binding and [3H]-HGG hydrolysis yielded a high correlation coefficient (r = 0.85). The specificity of ACE binding was clearly different from that expected of a BK receptor. Compounds structurally unrelated to BK, such as 5Q20881, pGlu-Lys-Trp-Ala-Pro-OH (BPP5a) and angiotensin I, inhibited T1K binding and [3H]-HGG hydrolysis by ACE.", 
    "331": "Vasodilatory and natriuretic effects of captopril were studied in the isolated hog kidney perfused with modified Krebs-Ringer solution. Renal arterial infusion of captopril caused increases in releases of renin, prostaglandins (PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGF2 alpha) and kinin, and was accompanied by a decrease in the renal vascular resistance and an increase in urinary sodium excretion. Indomethacin administered with captopril diminished the saluretic effect of captopril and evoked an increase in kinin, but was associated with a marked decrease in prostaglandin and renin releases, while renal vascular resistance remained decreased. Indomethacin alone did not alter vascular resistance and kinin; however, renin and prostaglandin releases were decreased. Aprotinin administered with captopril showed a decrease in releases of prostaglandins, renin and kinin without any change in vascular resistance. These results suggest that increased release of kinin induced by captopril contributes to a reduction in renal vascular resistance. Increased prostaglandin release after captopril administration may be caused by an increase in kinin without direct involvement of captopril in prostaglandin synthesis. Renal prostaglandins may enhance sodium excretion and mediate renin secretion in captopril perfusion.", 
    "332": "Asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) is the characteristic finding in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of chronic pressure overload on left ventricular hypertrophy and ASH in 34 patients with arterial hypertension. 15 patients (Group 1) showed normal blood pressure values (less than 140/90 mm Hg) under antihypertensive treatment but blood pressure remained elevated in 19 patients (Group 2) despite antihypertensive therapy. Left ventricular septal and posterior wall thickness, left ventricular internal diameter and systolic shortening of the internal diameter were measured in all patients by our standard technique. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly (p less than 0.001) elevated in Group 2 (164/98 mm Hg) as compared to Group 1 (128/84 mm Hg). Septal (1.7 versus 1.1 cm; p less than 0.01) and posterior wall thickness (1.2 versus 1.0 cm; p less than 0.01) as well as the septal/posterior wall ratio (1.4 versus 1.1; p less than 0.001) were significantly increased in Group 2 as compared to Group 1. Left ventricular internal diameter and systolic shortening of the internal diameter did not significantly differ between the two groups. ASH (septal/posterior wall ration greater than or equal to 1.3) was found in 10 patients of Group 2 (55%) and 1 patient of Group 1 (7%). It is concluded that asymmetric septal hypertrophy can be observed in one third of all patients with severe arterial hypertension. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy seems to be dependent on the duration and severity of hypertension and does not appear to be related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "333": "The oral inhibitor of the converting enzyme of angiotensin has previously been used successfully in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure. Its action as an arterial and venous vasodilator and in significantly reducing the heart rate which we have previously reported, led us to assess its effects in left ventricular failure during acute myocardial infarction. The effects of captopril were compared with those of isosorbide dinitrate in 10 patients with left ventricular failure during acute myocardial infarction. An arterial and venous vasodilatation was obtained with both drugs. Captopril induced a greater fall in left ventricular filling pressures and significantly reduced the heart rate, leading to a slight increase in left ventricular systolic work index. Pulmonary arterial resistances decreased more significantly with captopril whilst systemic arterial resistances fell equally. The left ventricular function curve was shifted to the left by both captopril and isosorbide dinitrate, but only captopril induced an upward shift and only captopril caused very significant reductions in the rate-pressure product. The plasma renin activity of these patients was high but the correlation with the vasodilator effect was poor. There was little change in medium-term survival (50% mortality). These results indicate that captopril may be a valuable drug in the treatment of left ventricular failure in acute myocardial infarction. However, its oral presentation makes it difficult to determine the optimal dose.", 
    "334": "We have investigated the relative importance of angiotensin and vasopressin in the regulation of arterial pressure following permanent interruption of supraspinal sympathetic influences. To accomplish this aim, the spinal cord of 12 dogs was transected just above the intervertebral foramen of C-6; several days later, we gave first a potent blocker of the vasculotropic actions of vasopressin and 40 min later captopril. The same experiment was performed in other dogs with the drug order reversed. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded continuously and blood samples were taken to measure plasma renin activity and plasma catecholamines. All studies were carried out at three levels of hydration: normal, after 36 h water deprivation and following an overnight infusion of 0.9% saline. Conscious dogs with complete surgical sympathectomy by spinal cord section had normal mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma renin activity but undetectable levels of catecholamines. Captopril produced significant falls in mean arterial pressure that were greatest in water deprivation and least in volume loading, whether the drug was given before or after treatment with the vasopressin antagonist. On the other hand, the vasopressin antagonist modified mean arterial pressure only in the water deprived state. In spinal dogs the renin angiotensin system assumes a primary role in maintaining normal mean arterial pressure at various extremes of body fluid volumes. Vasopressin plays a role only after removal of the two dominant systems.", 
    "335": "The effect of captopril on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its autoregulation was studied in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar rats. CBF was measured by the intracarotid 133Xe injection method. In one study 1 and 10 mg/kg captopril respectively were given intravenously to SHR and WKY. This caused the blood pressure to fall transiently below the lower blood pressure limit of CBF autoregulation; nonetheless CBF remained normal during captopril induced hypotension. In a second study it was shown with an integral uptake method that captopril is a very poor penetrator of the blood-brain barrier. In a third study captopril was instilled intracerebroventricularly in Wistar rats without any effect on CBF or its autoregulation. Thus when given intravenously, but not intracerebroventricularly captopril caused cerebral vasodilatation during acute hypotension.", 
    "336": "This study tested the ability of the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, to lessen the severity of acute renal failure following temporary occlusion of the renal artery. In the control group, 11 dogs were anesthetized with halothane, and the left kidney was isolated through a midline incision. The renal artery, vein, and ureter were then clamped for 120 min. Immediately after occlusion, the kidney was flushed with 40 ml of saline at 34 degrees C. When the clamp was released, a contralateral nephrectomy was performed and the animal allowed to recover. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were followed on a daily basis thereafter. Thirteen captopril-treated dogs were treated in the same fashion except that captopril (1.25 ml/kg, i.v.) was given prior to the 120-min period of renal ischemia. Three of 11 (27%) control dogs survived, whereas 10 of 13 (77%) captopril-treated animals survived (P less than 0.05). Serum creatinine (5.4 +/- 2.5 mg/dl) and serum urea nitrogen (96 +/- 33 mg/dl) peaked on day 8 in the captopril-treated group and were consistently lower than in the untreated group. These observations suggest that captopril is useful when temporary interruption of the renal circulation is encountered, such as in renal autotransplantation, cadaveric renal transplantation, and renal revascularization. These data also suggest that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system may lessen the severity of acute renal failure following renal ischemia.", 
    "337": "The metabolism of [14C]captopril-L-cysteine was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats and pure-bred beagles after a single i.v. dose (4 mg/kg). During the first 24 h, concn. of total radioactivity in blood were similar in both species. Captopril was found in small amounts in the blood of both species. In rats, captopril, bound covalently but reversibly to plasma proteins (CP-PR), was the major component in blood (70%), whereas captopril-L-cysteine was a minor component (23%) of the total radioactivity. In dog blood, CP-PR constituted a smaller fraction (45%) of the total radioactivity than in the rat and captopril-L-cysteine was the major component (53%). In 72 h, 89-91% of the dose was excreted in the urine of rats and dogs. Captopril-L-cysteine accounted for 7% (rat) and 68% (dog) of the radioactivity in urine; captopril accounted for 75% (rat) and 7% (dog). Other metabolites were present in the urine of both species. The greater net conversion of captopril-L-cysteine to CP-PR and to captopril in rats helps explain why captopril-L-cysteine is excreted in urine as a major metabolite of captopril in dogs but only a minor one in rats.", 
    "338": "Rats with, or without, bilateral lesions of the caudate nucleus received intracaudate injection of either renin or renin plus Captopril (SQ 14225). Following such treatment, animals were impaired on a spatial reversal task compared to controls. We concluded that the putative renin contaminant of nerve growth factor (NGF) does not contribute to behavioral recovery from brain damage observed after NGF injections in other studies. Furthermore, angiotensin II might play a possible role in mediating footshock learning and spatial reversal performance.", 
    "339": "The effects of 30-min intravenous infusions of 8-arginine vasopressin (AVP) and angiotensin-(1,8)-octapeptide (ANG II) to conscious dogs were studied by measurements of systolic (SABP), mean (MABP), and diastolic arterial blood pressures, central venous pressure (CVP), heart rate (HR), and plasma concentrations of vasopressin (pAVP). Infusion of AVP at six rates (0.4-12.8 ng X min-1 X kg-1) raised mean pAVP by 5-490 pg/ml and increased CVP by 2-10 cmH2O. HR decreased and arterial pressures increased with infusion rates of 1.6-12.8 ng X min-1 X kg-1. However, the increase in SABP was only transient. ANG II increased all arterial pressures; however, it barely changed CVP and did not change HR or pAVP. It is concluded that 1) AVP can elevate MABP without changes in SABP, 2) the effects of AVP on arterial pressures are buffered within 5-15 min, 3) CVP can be increased by doses of AVP that do not affect arterial pressures, and 4) the pressor activity is independent of the presence of ANG II. The results confirm that the cardiovascular response to vasopressin is qualitatively different from that elicited by ANG II.", 
    "340": "Central effects of hydrocortisone were investigated by injecting it intracerebroventricularly (icv) while recording blood pressure and heart rate in awake rats. Dose-dependent increases in both blood pressure and heart rate occurred following injections of hydrocortisone. Pretreatment by icv injections of the angiotensin II antagonist, [Sar1-Ile8]angiotensin II, completely abolished vasopressor responses to subsequent injections of hydrocortisone. When rats were later anesthetized with urethan to allow recording of abdominal sympathetic nerve activity, hydrocortisone produced vasopressor responses accompanied by corresponding increases in sympathetic nerve firing, which were also abolished by central pretreatment with either [Sar1-Ile8]angiotensin II or angiotensin I converting-enzyme inhibitor, captopril. These results indicate that centrally administered hydrocortisone stimulates the brain renin-angiotensin system to produce vasopressor responses by increasing sympathetic nerve firing.", 
    "341": "Previous metabolic studies of captopril suggest that the rapid dissociation of captopril-plasma protein conjugates in vivo is dependent upon endogenous thiols such as glutathione and cysteine. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that cysteine (0.06-3 mM) and glutathione (0.02-1 mM) cleave 14C-captopril-plasma protein conjugates in vitro. Dissociation of the drug-protein conjugate was accompanied by formation of the corresponding mixed disulphide which indicates that the reaction proceeds via a spontaneous thiol-disulphide interchange. Administration of high doses (50-300 mg/kg) of CP produced a time-dependent and dose-dependent decrease in hepatic glutathione concentrations in the mouse and the rat. The depletion of glutathione observed was similar to that produced by equimolar doses of D-penicillamine and paracetamol. Acute and chronic (7 days) administration of captopril (100 mg/kg) produces the same (11-12%) depletion of hepatic glutathione. However, changes in liver function as determined by elevation of serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase was only observed at doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg. Thus, although thiol-disulphide interactions between captopril and plasma proteins may contribute to the perturbation of hepatic glutathione concentrations, it is unlikely that this process will be of toxicological significance during therapeutic administration of captopril.", 
    "342": "Animal models of experimental heart failure have provided the basis of our current understanding of the role of the kidney and neurohumoral mechanisms in clinical congestive heart failure (CHF). The vasoconstrictor hormones, i.e., the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the sympathoadrenal and vasopressin systems, are activated in acute cardiac decompensation and are essential for the maintenance of systemic blood pressure. With expansion of extracellular fluid volume and restoration of blood pressure, these vasoconstrictor systems return to normal during chronic stable CHF. During cardiac decompensation, vasodilator prostaglandins (PG) I2 and E2 are also activated and may play a modulating role in the regulation of organ perfusion and function. Indeed, close correlations exist between plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II, and PGE2 metabolite concentration (r = 0.72 and 0.84, respectively). Based on our understanding of the neurohumoral mechanism in the regulation of vasculature in clinical CHF, alpha-adrenergic antagonists and inhibitions of the RAS have been used successfully as vasodilators in the therapy of CHF. Finally, recent observations also indicate that primary or secondary activation of these neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms can explain, in part, the development of tolerance to vasodilator therapy in CHF.", 
    "343": "The effects of the orally active converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (SQ 14225), on blood pressures and intakes and urine outputs of water and electrolytes were studied in rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (Brattleboro strain) and in Long Evans rats (parent strain). Captopril given in the drinking water (30 mg day-1 kg-1) caused an increase in fluid intake and urine output in both strains of rat; the difference between intake and measured output did not change. Captopril caused a significant natriuresis when given to animals in the non-steady state but did not significantly affect the urinary electrolyte excretion of animals in a steady state; in the latter group, however, captopril caused a significant reduction in food intake. Hence, under both conditions, captopril caused a reduction in sodium balance. Systolic blood pressures were reduced by captopril (given in the drinking water) in Long Evans rats and in Brattleboro rats; there was no accompanying change in heart rate. Bolus administration of captopril (30 mg day-1 kg-1) either intragastrically or subcutaneously did not change the fluid intakes or outputs in either strain of rat. In a separate experiment, rats were given the choice to drink water or a captopril solution. The results showed that the increased fluid intake in response to captopril was not due to a liking for the taste of the solution. The dipsogenic response to captopril may have been due to the fall in blood pressure which occurred, leading to renin release and a peripheral build-up of angiotensin I, which was converted into angiotensin II in the central nervous system. The possibility that the same dose given as a bolus may have inhibited central, as well as peripheral, converting enzyme activity is discussed.", 
    "344": "The renin-angiotensin system was studied in eight patients with Cushing's syndrome (four with adrenal adenoma and four with adrenal hyperplasia) and in five normal controls. Basal plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone concentration (PAC) were similar in supine position among Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal adenoma (PRA; 1.0 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/h, PAC; 7.4 +/- 1.0 ng/dl, mean +/- SE), those due to adrenal hyperplasia (1.0 +/- 0.2, 6.9 +/- 0.8) and the controls (0.8 +/- 0.1, 6.4 +/- 0.4). The PRA after furosemide (1 mg/kg i.v.) and 120 min. upright posture stimulation was similar among Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal adenoma (2.2 +/- 0.7 ng/ml/h), those due to adrenal hyperplasia (2.6 +/- 1.7) and the controls (2.5 +/- 1.2). However, the PAC response after the stimulation in Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal hyperplasia (7.1 +/- 1.2 ng/dl) was significantly lower than that in the controls (17.5 +/- 2.1) (p less than 0.01), although there was no significant difference between the PAC response in Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal adenoma (12.6 +/- 1.0) and the controls. These results indicate that PAC response to furosemide and upright pasture stimulation might be suppressed in Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal hyperplasia.", 
    "345": "Acute effects of MK421 were examined in 11 male normal volunteers. Oral administration of 5 mg of MK421 did not induce any changes in blood pressure or pulse rate. Plasma renin activity increased significantly from 7.3 +/- 2.9 ng/ml to 22.2 +/- 7.1 (p less than 0.05), whereas plasma aldosterone concentration did not change. Blood kinin, or urinary excretion of kallikrein and of prostaglandin E did not change. However, urinary excretion of sodium increased significantly from 44.0 +/- 6.8 mEq/4 hr to 56.5 +/- 6.5 (p less than 0.02) following the administration of MK421. The present results show that an increased renin release induced by MK421 is independent of change in blood pressure, and also suggest that MK421 may have a direct action on the renal tubules.", 
    "346": "Captopryl was used in 30 patients with different clinical forms of arterial hypertension (AH). Eight patients had the malignant arterial hypertension syndrome. Blood pressure became normal in 8, decreased in 9 and did not respond to hypotensive treatment in 2 patients. The drug was discontinued due to intolerance in 1 patient. In the course of captopryl treatment, natriuresis increased, potassium concentration increased in the plasma and decreased in the urine, plasma renin activity and aldosterone level increased. Minoxidil was used in 48 patients with AH of varying clinical forms, 19 of those having the malignant AH syndrome. The hypotensive effect of treatment was satisfactory. Minoxidil used as the sole therapeutic agent resulted in increased heart rate and plasma renin activity, and retention of fluids, which disappeared after beta-adrenoblockers and diuretics were added. Patients with the malignant hypertension syndrome showed a reduction, and sometimes disappearance, of retinal ischemic and hemorrhagic foci within 15-19 days of minoxidil treatment, or at the end of the treatment course with captopryl.", 
    "347": "To investigate the possibility that angiotensin II (ANG II) is involved in the regulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, ANG II was injected intraventricular ANG II caused an increase in plasma LH concentrations in 10 min, whereas intravenous ANG II in the same dose had no significant effect. Intraventricular administration of the ANG II antagonist, saralasin, during the afternoon of proestrus induced a significant decrease in the number of rats ovulating and abolished the ovulatory surge in LH secretion seen in saline-injected control animals. Intravenous saralasin in two different doses failed to inhibit ovulation and produced only a small decrease in the LH surge. In animals treated with intraventricular saralasin, the increase in plasma LH concentration produced by intravenous injection of 50 ng of LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) was normal, indicating no alteration in the sensitivity of the gonadotrops to LHRH. Intraventricular administration of the converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril diacid, inhibited ovulation and the ovulatory surge, whereas systemically administered enalapril diacid had no effect on LH secretion. The data suggest that ANG II generated in the brain may play a significant role in the regulation of LH secretion on the day of proestrus.", 
    "348": "Reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been reported not to occur with all antihypertensive agents. Moreover, a dissociation between blood pressure response to medical therapy and reversal of ventricular hypertrophy has been previously observed. To evaluate the effects of captopril we studied the electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in 26 severe hypertensive patients who received the drug for more than one year. In 14 patients with normal pretreatment ECG, captopril controlled blood pressure effectively [132 +/- 2.9 (SE) to 104 +/- 3.9 mmHg, p less than 0.001], but had no effect on ECG voltage. In 12 patients with pretreatment LVH, two different response patterns were observed despite similar blood pressure control (144 +/- 4.9 to 102 +/- 3.1 mmHg and 148 +/- 7.3 to 109 +/- 7.3 mmHg, p less than 0.001 for both): seven had complete normalization of ECG while five had residual LVH pattern. No significant difference was found between the latter two groups in regard to age, sex, weight, etiology of hypertension, pretreatment ECG voltage, blood pressure, plasma renin activity, duration of treatment and duration of maintained blood pressure control. The reversal of LVH pattern occurred early (between 12 to 16 months) with no overall correlation between lowering of blood pressure and ECG voltage changes. The heterogeneity of response observed in this study suggests that factors other than blood pressure control modify the reversal of cardiac hypertrophy by antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "349": "Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that may be inhibited in vivo by three classes of compounds: specific antibody, general peptide inhibitors of acid proteases, and substrate analogs. With the availability of highly purified renin, specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies have become available. The former have already been used extensively in physiological studies with intact animals. Pepstatin is an inhibitor of many acid proteases. Its in vivo application has been retarded by relative insolubility, but recent chemical modifications, particularly the addition of charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus, have rendered it more useful. The minimal substrate for renin is an octapeptide segment of the protein substrate: His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr. Variants of this sequence have resulted in competitive inhibitors that are useful in vivo. Effectiveness of a given peptide varies among different species of animals, possibly because of different substrate specificity. To support this hypothesis, it has been reported that the amino acid sequences of angiotensinogens around the site where renin cleaves may vary among species. Effectiveness of inhibitors is also dependent on the hydrophobicity of amino acids near the cleavage site. Recently, remarkably active inhibitors have been synthesized by reducing the peptide bond that is cleaved by renin. Studies with monkeys show that a peptide renin inhibitors may cause hypotension after sodium depletion and normalize blood pressure in Goldblatt hypertension to the same degree as a converting-enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "350": "Bradykinin (BK) initially produced concentration related relaxations of the rabbit basilar artery in vitro under resting tension and when contracted with 5-hydroxytryptamine. Concentration-effect (C-E) curves to BK repeated at 2 h intervals over an 8-10 h period resulted in the production of progressively increased contractile responses. The induction of these contractile responses to BK was prevented by pre-incubation of these tissues with cycloheximide. On tissues which had been challenged with BK at 2 h intervals for 8 h in the absence of cycloheximide the rank order of potency of three kinins to produce contraction was methionyl-lysyl-BK (M-L-BK) greater than BK greater than des-Arg9-BK. On the same tissues the specific B1-receptor antagonist des-Arg9-Leu8-BK inhibited the contractile effects of BK. These results suggest the presence of a B1-receptor mediating contraction. The rank order of potency of the kinins to produce relaxation of tissues preincubated with cycloheximide was BK greater than M-L-BK greater than des-Arg9-BK which suggests the presence of a B2-receptor mediating these responses. Angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) produced concentration related contractions of the tissue. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril, BPP5a and BPP9a inhibited responses to AI but had no effect on contractile C-E curves to BK, AII and 5-HT or on relaxant C-E curves to BK. These results suggest that the rabbit basilar artery in vitro contains two BK receptors, a B1 receptor mediating contraction and a B2 receptor mediating relaxation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "351": "The treatment of hypertension should be a stepwise approach to the problem. The mild forms can be handled by diuretics. More severe forms are successfully treated by a combination of beta-blocker, vasodilator and diuretics. In resistent cases the Angiotensin II - inhibitor (Captopril) can be tried. In emergency situations with malignant hypertension more powerful vasodilators like diazoxid or Nitroprussid Sodium are necessary. For the discontinuation treatment interruption a slow reduction of drugs is recommended as rebound-phenomena can be expected.", 
    "352": "A series of potent inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, E.C. 3.4.15.1) derived from benzofused 1-carboxyalkyl-3-(1-carboxy-3-phenyl-propylamino) lactams (III) is described. In the most effective inhibitors (I50 2-4 X 10(-9)M) the lactam is 7 or 8 membered and the N-1 side chain is carboxymethyl or carboxyethyl. Conformational and steric factors pertinent to binding to the enzyme are discussed.", 
    "353": "The converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, in single daily doses of 10-40 mg, was given to 20 hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis. The blood pressure fall six hours after the first dose of enalapril was significantly related to the pretreatment plasma concentrations of active renin and angiotensin II and to the concurrent fall in angiotensin II. Blood pressure fell further with continued treatment; the long term fall was not significantly related to pretreatment plasma renin or angiotensin II concentrations. At three months, 24 hours after the last dose of enalapril, blood pressure, plasma angiotensin II, and converting enzyme activity remained low and active renin and angiotensin I high; six hours after dosing, angiotensin II had, however, fallen further. The rise in active renin during long term treatment was proportionally greater than the rise in angiotensin I; this probably reflects the fall in renin substrate that occurs with converting enzyme inhibition. Enalapril alone caused reduction in exchangeable sodium, with distinct increases in serum potassium, creatinine, and urea. Enalapril was well tolerated and controlled hypertension effectively long term; only two of the 20 patients required concomitant diuretic treatment.", 
    "354": "Membranous glomerulopathy and proteinuria have occurred in patients receiving captopril for hypertension. In this case of captopril-associated nephrotic syndrome, a pretreatment biopsy specimen showed normal histologic appearance and glomerular ultrastructure. A posttreatment biopsy specimen showed membranous glomerulopathy. It seems likely that captopril caused the membraneous glomerulopathy."
