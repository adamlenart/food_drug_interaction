We investigated whether treatment with ANG-II type 1 receptor blocker, olmesartan medoxomil is associated with the attenuation of cardiac myosin-induced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) through recently established new axis of ACE-2/ANG 1-7 mas receptor. DCM was elicited in Lewis rats by immunisation with cardiac myosin, and 28 days after immunisation, the surviving Lewis rats were divided into two groups and treated with either olmesartan medoxomil (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Myocardial protein and mRNA levels of ACE-2, ANG 1-7 mas receptor were upregulated in the olmesartan-treated group compared with those of vehicle-treated DCM rats. In contrast, Olmesartan treatment effectively suppressed the myocardial protein and mRNA expressions of inflammatory markers in comparison to the vehicle-treated DCM rats. Olmesartan treatment significantly reduced fibrosis, hypertrophy and their marker molecules (OPN, CTGF, ANP and GATA-4, respectively), as well as matrix metalloproteinases compared with those of vehicle-treated DCM rats. Enhanced myocardial protein levels of phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-JNK and phospho MAPKAPK-2 in the vehicle-treated DCM rats were prevented by olmesartan treatment. In addition, olmesartan treatment significantly lowered the protein expressions (Nitrotyrosine, p47phox and p67phox) and superoxide radical production compared with those of vehicle-treated DCM rats. Our present study might serve as a new therapeutic target of DCM in cardiovascular diseases and cardiac myosin-induced DCM via the modulation of ACE-2/ANG 1-7 mas receptor axis in rats with DCM after myosin-immunisation.",

This report describes the global and regional prevalence of CV risk factors and use of preventive medications at baseline in participants in the ongoing STabilization of Atherosclerotic plaque By Initiation of darapLadIb TherapY (STABILITY) trial.", 
    "2": "Detailed individual data on CV risk factors were obtained before randomization in 15,828 patients with chronic coronary heart disease (CHD) from 39 countries on five continents. Subjects had a history of myocardial infarction, prior coronary revascularization, or multi-vessel CHD without revascularization and at least one additional CV risk factor. The majority were taking a statin (97%), antiplatelet therapy (96%), beta-blocker (79%), or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (77%). However, a large proportion of patients did not achieve guideline-recommended targets. For instance, in 29% low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was >2.5 mmol/l and in 46% blood pressure was \u2265140/90 mmHg or \u2265130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes or renal impairment. The body mass index was >30 kg/m(2) in 36%, waist circumference \u2265102 cm for men or \u226588 cm for women in 54%, and 18% were smoking. Regional differences in risk factor prevalence and target achievement were observed and were more marked for LDL cholesterol and obesity.",

    "4": "The type II transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 activates the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) on the cell surface following receptor binding during viral entry into cells. In the absence of TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV achieves cell entry via an endosomal pathway in which cathepsin L may play an important role, i.e., the activation of spike protein fusogenicity. This study shows that a commercial serine protease inhibitor (camostat) partially blocked infection by SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) in HeLa cells expressing the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2. Simultaneous treatment of the cells with camostat and EST [(23,25)trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamindo-3-methylbutane ethyl ester], a cathepsin inhibitor, efficiently prevented both cell entry and the multistep growth of SARS-CoV in human Calu-3 airway epithelial cells. This efficient inhibition could be attributed to the dual blockade of entry from the cell surface and through the endosomal pathway. These observations suggest camostat as a candidate antiviral drug to prevent or depress TMPRSS2-dependent infection by SARS-CoV.", 
    "5": "Despite significant advances in pharmacological and clinical treatment, heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. G-protein coupled receptors are a wide superfamily of plasma membrane receptors which represent an important target of heart failure drug therapy. Since heart failure is characterized by the overactivity of different neurohormones, such as catecholamines and angiotensin II, responsible for several detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system, over the last decade therapeutic strategies targeting beta-adrenergic and angiotensin receptors have been developed. Despite the introduction of successful drug classes, such as beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and sartans, heart failure still poses an enormous challenge, thus indicating the urgent need to develop innovative treatments that might counteract mechanisms involved in heart failure onset and progression. It is now established that a single receptor, activated by the same agonist, can elicit several different signaling pathways often resulting in opposite cellular responses, some beneficial and some detrimental. However, drugs currently used in heart failure target receptors on their extracellular domain by competing with the endogenous agonists. Thus, they can inhibit non-specifically all the receptor-related signaling pathways including those with beneficial activity whose blockade would not be desirable in heart failure. These observations stress the need for the generation of new therapeutic molecules able to target specific signaling pathways which might result in innovative therapies for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "6": "A variety of chronic kidney diseases tend to progress towards end-stage kidney disease. Progression is largely due to factors unrelated to the initial disease, including arterial hypertension and proteinuria. Intensive treatment of these two factors is potentially able to slow the progression of kidney disease. Blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, either converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, reduce both blood pressure and proteinuria and appear superior to a conventional antihypertensive treatment regimen in preventing progression to end-stage kidney disease. The most recent recommendations state that in children with chronic kidney disease without proteinuria the blood pressure goal is the corresponding 75th centile for body length, age and gender; whereas the 50th centile should be aimed in children with chronic kidney disease and pathologically increased proteinuria.",

A copy of ECG was sent to central office every time new atrial fibrillation was detected by investigators.", 
    "9": "During a median follow-up period of 4.7 years, new atrial fibrillation occurred in 2092 patients (15.1 per 1000 \u200apatient-years). Risk of atrial fibrillation increased with age, SBP and pulse pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, BMI, serum creatinine and history of hypertension, coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease (all P\u200a<\u200a0.01). After adjustment for BMI and other variables, atrial fibrillation risk increased with hip circumference. History of hypertension was associated with a 34% higher risk of new atrial fibrillation. New atrial fibrillation portended an increased risk of congestive heart failure [hazard ratio 2.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.45-3.40, P\u200a<\u200a0.01] and cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.41, P\u200a<\u200a0.01). Risk of stroke was unaffected (hazard ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.93-1.40), whereas that of myocardial infarction was reduced (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.82). Patients with new atrial fibrillation were more likely to receive vitamin K antagonists (P\u200a<\u200a0.01), statins (P\u200a<\u200a0.05) and \u03b2-blockers (P\u200a<\u200a0.01) than those in sinus rhythm.",

    "11": "The objective of this study was to establish whether 1) hyperactivity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) produces apoptosis in early stages of cardiac disease; and 2) Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is involved in these apoptotic events. Two models of hypertrophy were used at an early stage of cardiac disease: spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and isoproterenol-treated rats (Iso-rats). At 4 mo, SHR showed blood pressure, aldosterone serum levels, used as RAAS activity index, and left ventricular mass index, used as hypertrophy index, above control values by 84.2 \u00b1 2.6 mmHg, 211.2 \u00b1 25.8%, and 8.6 \u00b1 1.1 mg/mm, respectively. There was also an increase in apoptotis (Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-mediated nick-end labeling positive cells) associated with an enhancement of CaMKII activity with respect to age-matched controls (phosphorylated-CaMKII, 98.7 \u00b1 14.1 above control). Similar results were observed in 4-mo-old Iso-rats. Cardiac function studied by echocardiography remained unaltered in all groups. Enalapril treatment significantly prevented hypertrophy, apoptosis, and CaMKII activity. Moreover, intracellular Ca(2+) handling in isolated myocytes was similar between SHR, Iso-rats, and their aged-matched controls. However, SHR and Iso-rats showed a significant increase in superoxide anion generation (lucigenin) and lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance). In transgenic mice with targeted cardiomyocyte expression of a CaMKII inhibitory peptide (AC3-I) or a scrambled control peptide (AC3-C), Iso treatment increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substance in both strains, whereas it increased CaMKII activity and apoptosis only in AC3-C mice. Endogenous increases in RAAS activity induce ROS and CaMKII-dependent apoptosis in vivo. CaMKII activation could not be associated with intracellular Ca(2+) increments and was directly related to the increase in oxidative stress.",

In 2005, the American Diabetes Association published new guidelines on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes [plasma glucose levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL fasting or from 140 to 199 mg/dL 2 h after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)]. This study sought to evaluate the prevalence and the potentially associated factors of pre-diabetes in a cohort of renal transplant patients on maintenance immunosuppressive medication. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of HbA1-c measurements in predicting pre-diabetes in transplant patients is undetermined.",

On the day of testing, multiple factors presumably associated with pre-diabetes were assessed via a standardized questionnaire: daily steroid dosage, triglyceride levels, cholesterol levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula], systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), BMI <>30 and <>25, number of renal transplants, number of rejection episodes prior to testing, source of renal transplant, cause of renal failure and medications as related to the prescription of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mophetil, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1-blockers, statins, \u03b2-blockers and thiazide diuretics. Patients diagnosed with pre-diabetes were compared to subjects with normal test results. Fishers exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test were applied to compare the two study populations, whereas multivariate logistic regression was used to seek potential risk factors as related to other covariates. Risk ratios (RRs) to develop pre-diabetes were calculated for significant variables.",

From the remaining 187 patients, 130 (69.5%) displayed normal test results whereas 57 (30.5%) had results indicative of pre-diabetes. On multivariate regression analysis, patients with pre-diabetes were significantly older {55.3 \u00b1 12.1 versus 47.7 \u00b1 12.6 years, P = 0.0007, RRs per 5 years increase 1.28 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.11-1.47]}, had more rejection episodes [0.26 \u00b1 0.48 versus 0.12 \u00b1 0.37, P = 0.0024, RRs per rejection episode 3.99 (95% CI 1.63-9.77)] and showed lower diastolic blood pressure readings [77 \u00b1 10 mmHg versus 81 \u00b1 10 mmHg, P = 0.0362, RR per 5 mmHg decrease 1.14 (95% CI 1.04-1.49)].",

Participants were stratified by baseline eGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) as follows: normal/increased (\u226590; n=8027), mild reduction (60-89; n=17,778), and moderate/severe reduction (<60; n=5545). Outcomes were cardiovascular mortality (primary outcome), total mortality, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and ESRD.",

In participants with an eGFR <60, there was no significant difference in cardiovascular mortality between chlorthalidone and amlodipine (P=0.64), or chlorthalidone and lisinopril (P=0.56). Likewise, no significant differences were observed for total mortality, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or ESRD.",

By eGFR stratum, 5-year treatment with amlodipine or lisinopril was not superior to chlorthalidone in preventing cardiovascular events, mortality, or ESRD during 9-year follow-up. Because data on proteinuria were not available, these findings may not be extrapolated to proteinuric CKD.", 
    "20": "Hypertension has a major associated risk for organ damage and mortality, which is further heightened in patients with prior cardiovascular (CV) events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria and renal impairment. Given that most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensives to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals, identifying the most appropriate combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action offer potential advantages over free-drug combinations, including simplification of treatment regimens, convenience and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience resulting from SPC use is recognised in updated hypertension guidelines. Despite a wide choice of SPCs for hypertension treatment, clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons to guide selection for individual patients is lacking. However, in patients with evidence of renal disease or at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminura and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other antihypertensive classes. Furthermore, RAS inhibitors attenuate the oedema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, making them a good choice for combination therapy. The occurrence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough supports the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for RAS blockade rather than ACE inhibitors. In this regard, ARB-based SPCs are available in combination with the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the calcium CCB, amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with preferential pharmacodynamic profile compared with several other ARBs, and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of CV disease progression, is available in two SPC formulations, telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine. Clinical studies suggest that in CV high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB/CCB combination may be preferred to ARB/HCTZ combinations due to superior renoprotective and CV benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders. However, selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should be dependent on careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology.", 
    "21": "Evidence of endogenous angiotensin-(1-12) [Ang-(1-12)] may necessitate revision of the accepted view that Ang I is the immediate peptide product derived from the precursor protein angiotensinogen. As the processing of this peptide has not been fully elucidated, we characterized Ang-(1-12) metabolism in the serum and kidney of the mRen2.Lewis rat, a model of high circulating renin and ACE expression. A sensitive HPLC-based method to detect the metabolism ex vivo of low concentrations of (125)I-labeled Ang-(1-12) was utilized. Ang-(1-12) processing to serum did not reveal the participation of renin; however, serum ACE readily converted Ang-(1-12) to Ang I with subsequent metabolism to Ang II. Ang I and Ang II forming activities for serum ACE were 102\u00b14 and 104\u00b13 fmol/ml/min serum (n=3), respectively, and both products were abolished by the potent ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The metabolism of Ang-(1-12) in renal cortical membranes also revealed the formation of Ang I; however, the main products were Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(1-4) at 129\u00b19 and 310\u00b112 fmol/mg/min protein (n=4), respectively. Neprilysin inhibition abolished these products and substantially reduced the overall metabolism of Ang-(1-12). Incubation of Ang-(1-12) with either human or mouse neprilysin revealed identical products. We conclude that endogenous Ang-(1-12) may contribute to the expression of biologically active angiotensins through a renin-independent pathway. The preferred route for Ang-(1-12) metabolism likely reflects the relative tissue content of ACE and neprilysin.",

Data on new users of the drugs of interest were extracted from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database. New users were matched by propensity score to new users of comparator drugs in each example. Analyses were conducted sequentially to emulate prospective monitoring.

    "27": "Endothelial dysfunction is found in hypertensive patients and may serve as a prognostic marker of future cardiovascular events. Endothelial function can be assessed noninvasively by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). The goal of this paper is to summarize comprehensively the clinical trials that investigated the effects of antihypertensive drugs on endothelial function assessed by FMD in hypertensive patients. A PubMed-based search found 38 clinical trial papers published from January 1999 to June 2011. Significant improvement of FMD after antihypertensive treatment was shown in 43 of 71 interventions (among 38 clinical trial papers). Angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors appeared to improve FMD more than other drug types. Antihypertensive treatment can improve endothelial dysfunction when assessed by FMD, although there are conflicting data that require further research.", 
    "28": "Despite the wide array of antihypertensive agents and the availability of national guidelines regarding treatment for hypertension, the disease remains uncontrolled in nearly 50% of affected patients. Furthermore, the number of patients with resistant hypertension continues to increase. For patients with resistant hypertension, the American Heart Association has advocated for clinical studies to determine appropriate pharmacologic treatment strategies. One proposed strategy involves ambulatory measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA) to guide the selection of antihypertensive therapy. Patients with low PRA would be prescribed natriuretic volume-mediated therapies (e.g., diuretics and calcium channel blockers), whereas those with high PRA would receive antirenin system therapies (e.g., \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers). This review focuses on the principles of PRA-guided therapy, its historical development, alternative approaches to classifying patients into categories of response to antihypertensive agents, and recent data supporting the use of plasma renin activity-guided hypertension management.", 
    "29": "Cancer and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of death worldwide. Cardiovascular medications have recently been found to have favorable effects also for the treatment of noncardiovascular diseases, including cancer. In this review, we use a reverse bedside-to-bench approach to investigate the effects of common cardiovascular medications on tumor angiogenesis and vascular angiogenesis. Aspirin seems to reduce the risk of developing cancer, particularly colon cancer. However, whether the protective influence of aspirin is due to antiangiogenesis effect is still unclear. \u03b2-Blockers, which are normally used to reduce heart rate and prolong diastole, trigger an increase in stretch-associated release of proangiogenic growth factors thereby inducing angiogenesis. However, according to other studies \u03b2-blockers are able to inhibit angiogenesis via multiplicate mechanisms. Similarly, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker have controversial effects for the regulation of cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Statins can augment collateral vascular growth in ischemic tissues and restrict the development of cancer. So this topical anti-inflammatory drug seems to be of high value for further therapy. Finally, suggestions on how this pilot experience may guide the conduct of future preclinical investigations, and clinical trials are discussed.", 
    "30": "Our previous studies in rats with ablation nephrectomy have shown similar cardiorenal protective effects of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-dependent treatment (combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker) and RAS-independent treatment (combination of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonist and diuretics). Moreover, selective blockade of endothelin (ET) receptor type A (ET(A)) improved survival rate and attenuated hypertension and organ damage in Ren-2 transgenic rats. Therefore, we were interested in whether ET(A) receptor blockade could have additive effects to the classical blockade of the RAS. Transgenic rats underwent 5/6 renal ablation at the age of 2 months and were treated for 20 weeks with RAS blockers alone (angiotensin II receptor blocker - losartan, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor - trandolapril), ET(A) receptor blocker alone (atrasentan) or with the combination of RAS and ET(A) receptor blockade. RAS blockade normalized blood pressure and improved survival. It decreased cardiac hypertrophy and proteinuria as well as tissue angiotensin II and ET-1 levels. In contrast, ET(A) receptor blockade only partially improved survival rate, reduced blood pressure, attenuated the development of cardiac hypertrophy and transiently reduced proteinuria. However, no additive cardio- and renoprotective effects of ET(A) and RAS blockade were noted at the end of the study.",

Visceral angio-oedema secondary to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use can cause abdominal pain. The association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and visceral angio-oedema is not well recognized partly because the onset of angio-oedema might be delayed for months or years after commencement of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The epidemiology of angio-oedema is now changing in parallel with the increasing use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We present a case of visceral angio-oedema secondary to perindopril. This diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion because if not recognized early patients undergo extensive and expensive negative evaluation.",

These peptides display homology with fragments of albumin from Trimeresurus flavoviridis. Bolus intra-arterial injection of the purified or the synthetic peptide produced a strong and sustained vasopressor response in the anaesthetized snake (CDT) and rats (Wistar); this hypotensive effect was also potentiated by captopril-an angiotensin-converting (0.1 mg/kg) enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "37": "Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc dependent peptidase with a major role in regulating vasoactive peptide metabolism. ACE, a transmembrane protein, undergoes proteolysis, or shedding, by an as yet unidentified proteinase to release a catalytically active soluble form of the enzyme. Physiologically, soluble ACE in plasma is derived primarily from endothelial cells. We demonstrate that ACE shedding from confluent endothelial cells is increased in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, but not phorbol esters. Characterisation of lipopolysaccharide stimulated shedding showed that there is a lag phase before soluble ACE can be detected which is sensitive to inhibitors of translation, NF-\u03baB, TNF\u03b1 and TNFR-I/II. The shedding phase is less sensitive to these inhibitors, but is ablated by BB-94, a Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP)/A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) inhibitor. Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase (TIMP) profiling suggested a requirement for ADAM9 in lipopolysaccharide induced ACE shedding, which was confirmed by depletion with siRNA. Transient transfection of ADAM9 and ACE cDNAs into HEK293 cells demonstrated that ADAM9 requires both membrane anchorage and its catalytic domain to shed ACE.",

Whey proteins are a rich source of ACE inhibitory peptides and have shown a blood pressure reduction effect i.e. antihypertensive activity. The aim of this work was to develop a simplified process using a combination of adsorption and microfiltration steps for the production of hydrolysates from whey with high ACE inhibitory activity and potency; the latter was measured as the IC50, which is the peptide concentration required to reduce ACE activity by half. This process integrates the selective separation of \u03b2-lactoglobulin- and casein-derived peptides (CDP) from rennet whey and their hydrolysis, which results in partially pure, less complex hydrolysates with high bioactive potency. Hydrolysis was carried out with protease N \"Amano\" in a thermostatically controlled membrane reactor operated in a batch mode. By applying the integrative approach it was possible to produce from the same feedstock two different hydrolysates that exhibited high ACE inhibition. One hydrolysate was mainly composed of casein-derived peptides with IC50=285 \u03bcg/mL. In this hydrolysate we identified the well-known potent ACE-inhibitor and antihypertensive tripeptide Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and another novel octapeptide Gln-Asp-Lys-Thr-Glu-Ile-Pro-Thr (QDKTEIPT). The second hydrolysate was mainly composed of \u03b2-lactoglobulin derived peptides with IC50=28 \u03bcg/mL. This hydrolysate contained a tetrapeptide (Ile-Ile-Ala-Glu) IIAE as one of the two major peptides.

    "108": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal diseases. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), blockade of RAS by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of renal function deterioration. However, aldosterone, another key hormone of the RAS, is not directly targeted by ACEI or ARB. Hyperaldosteronism, apart from promoting sodium and fluid retention, causes inflammation and fibrosis in the heart and kidney. Studies have shown that although plasma aldosterone level shows an initial decrease following ACEI or ARB treatment, it returns to pretreatment level or even increases paradoxically after prolonged treatment. This \"aldosterone breakthrough\" forms the basis of adding mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist on top of ACEI or ARB for renal protection. New insights into the pathophysiological role of aldosterone in CKD further expands its potential indications, and there was a growing body of evidence in the past 10 years, which showed a substantial antiproteinuric effect and possibly a considerable renoprotective effect of MR antagonist. Since aldosterone does not act on the efferent glomerular arteriole and has no effect on intraglomerular hemodynamics, the very fact that MR antagonist ameliorates proteinuria sheds light on the physiology of glomerular permeability barrier. This review summarizes the data regarding the theoretical benefit as well as clinical use of MR antagonist in renal diseases.", 
    "109": "The intraglomerular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is linked to the pathogenesis of progressive glomerular diseases. Glomerular podocytes and mesangial cells play distinct roles in the metabolism of angiotensin (ANG) peptides. However, our understanding of the RAS enzymatic capacity of glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) remains incomplete. We explored the mechanisms of endogenous cleavage of ANG substrates in cultured human GEnCs (hGEnCs) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and isotope-labeled peptide quantification. Overall, hGEnCs metabolized ANG II at a significantly slower rate compared with podocytes, whereas the ANG I processing rate was comparable between glomerular cell types. ANG II was the most abundant fragment of ANG I, with lesser amount of ANG-(1-7) detected. Formation of ANG II from ANG I was largely abolished by an ANG-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, whereas ANG-(1-7) formation was decreased by a prolylendopeptidase (PEP) inhibitor, but not by a neprilysin inhibitor. Cleavage of ANG II resulted in partial conversion to ANG-(1-7), a process that was attenuated by an ACE2 inhibitor, as well as by an inhibitor of PEP and prolylcarboxypeptidase. Further fragmentation of ANG-(1-7) to ANG-(1-5) was mediated by ACE. In addition, evidence of aminopeptidase N activity (APN) was demonstrated by detecting amelioration of conversion of ANG III to ANG IV by an APN inhibitor. While we failed to find expression or activity of aminopeptidase A, a modest activity attributable to aspartyl aminopeptidase was detected. Messenger RNA and gene expression of the implicated enzymes were confirmed. These results indicate that hGEnCs possess prominent ACE activity, but modest ANG II-metabolizing activity compared with that of podocytes. PEP, ACE2, prolylcarboxypeptidase, APN, and aspartyl aminopeptidase are also enzymes contained in hGEnCs that participate in membrane-bound ANG peptide cleavage.

Scopolamine caused impairment in memory which was associated with reduced CBF, acetylcholine (ACh) level and elevated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Perindopril ameliorated scopolamine induced amnesia in both the behavioral paradigms. Further, perindopril prevented elevation of AChE and MDA level in mice brain. There was a significant increase in CBF and ACh level in perindopril treated mice. However, scopolamine had no significant effect on ATP level and mRNA expression of angiotensin receptors and ACE in cortex and hippocampus.

Subtilisin NAT (nattokinase) produced by B. subtilis also inhibited ACE, and the inhibition was markedly stimulated by heat treatment of subtilisin at 120 \u00b0C for 15 min. Inhibition of ACE by subtilisin was of a mixed type: the decrease in V(max) and the increase in K(m) value. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that heat treatment of subtilisin caused inactivation with fragmentation of the enzyme protein into small peptides. The inhibitory action of subtilisin was not due to an enzymatic action of protease, but may be ascribed to the potent ACE-inhibitory peptides such as LY and FY, amino acid sequences in subtilisin. HPLC-MS analysis of heat-inactivated subtilisin confirmed that LY and FY were liberated by fragmentation of the enzyme. Inhibition of ACE by subtilisin and its degradation peptides such as LY and FY may participate in the suppression of blood pressure by ingestion of natto.",

The abdominal aorta was cannulated and autoperfused at different volume rates to obtain the pressure-flow curves. In the first experimental series, the blood flow-pressure dependence was measured before and after intravenous injection of quadropril (1 mg/kg). In the next series, this dependence was obtained before and after injection of NO-synthase inhibitor L-NNA (10 mg/kg) and quadropril, respectively. Quadropril potentiated vasodilation caused by an increase in perfusion volume rate in both normo- and hypertensive rats and stabilized intravascular pressure. Inhibition of NO synthesis elevated hydraulic resistance and decreased stability of intravascular pressure in normo- and hypertensive rats. In normotensive rats, these changes were promoted by a decrease in vascular distensibility. Under these conditions, quadropril pronouncedly potentiated the flow-dependent vasodilation only in SHR rats, which was revealed methodically by an increase in perfusion rate in the posterior quarter of the body. Thus, in SHR rats the quadropril-potentiated vasodilation in response to increased perfusion rate does not depend on NO synthesis.",

    "161": "Tumor and inflammation have many common features. One hallmark of both is enhanced vascular permeability, which is mediated by various factors including bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO), peroxynitrite, prostaglandins etc. A unique characteristic of tumors, however, is defective vascular anatomy. The enhanced vascular permeability in tumors is also distinctive in that extravasated macromolecules are not readily cleared. We utilized the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of tumors for tumor selective delivery of macromolecular drugs. Consequently, such drugs, nanoparticles or lipid particles, when injected intravenously, selectively accumulate in tumor tissues and remain there for long periods. The EPR effect of tumor tissue is frequently inhomogeneous and the heterogeneity of the EPR effect may reduce the tumor delivery of macromolecular drugs. Therefore, we developed methods to augment the EPR effect without inducing adverse effects for instance raising the systemic blood pressure by infusing angiotensin II during arterial injection of SMANCS/Lipiodol. This method was validated in clinical setting. Further, benefits of utilization of NO-releasing agent such as nitroglycerin or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were demonstrated. The EPR effect is thus now widely accepted as the most basic mechanism for tumor-selective targeting of macromolecular drugs, or so-called nanomedicine.",

This hypothesis, which remained dormant for many years, was recently resurrected by several experimental studies that showed that the brain possesses its own renin-angiotensin system (RAS) similar to the one existing in the systemic circulation. These studies also showed that the brain RAS plays an important role in stroke prevention and neuronal protection through its active peptide Ang II. In addition, these studies demonstrated that the beneficial effects of Ang II are mediated through stimulation of its subtype 2 receptors, and possibly through stimulation of the subtype 4 receptors by Ang IV, a metabolite of Ang II. Drugs that selectively block the Ang II subtype 1 receptors, such as the angiotensin receptor blockers, have shown superior protection against strokes and neuronal damage than drugs that decrease the generation of Ang II, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers.

Group ACEI/ARB included patients on ACEI/ARB without TZD, group TZD included patients on TZD and antihypertensive agents other than ACEI/ARB, group ACEI/ARB/TZD consisted of patients on combined therapy with ACEI/ARB and TZD and the control group C included patients never exposed to ACEI/ARB or TZD. Clinical and laboratory data were collected prior to initiation of treatment and after 6 months.Neither hematocrit nor hemoglobin showed any significant change from baseline at the end of the study in group C. In both group ACEI/ARB and group TZD a small, but statistically significant reduction in hematocrit (~ 1% point) and hemoglobin levels (~ 0.3 g/dl) was seen. A greater statistically and clinically important reduction in hematocrit (~ 3% points) and hemoglobin (~ 1 g/dl) levels was observed in group ACEI/ARB/TZD. Furthermore, incident anemia at the end reached 7% in group TZD and 23% in group ACEI/ARB/TZD.Coadministration of RAS inhibitors and PPAR-\u03b3 agonists should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hematocrit lowering and anemia in uncomplicated type 2 diabetic patients with normal serum creatinine. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism(s), the cardiovascular consequences and the cost utility of anemia workup in such patients.",

ACE mRNA expression was significantly elevated after SBS creation (0.24 \u00b1 0.07 vs. 0.42 \u00b1 0.11), and ACE-I administration further increased mucosal ACE mRNA expression (0.54 \u00b1 0.12). Interestingly, AT1R mRNA expression showed a significant decline in the SBS group compared to Sham levels, and ACE-I administration increased AT1R mRNA expression to Sham levels. No significant difference in AT2R mRNA expression was found between Sham and SBS group.",

    "201": "A total of 24 rabbits were divided into three groups: the sham operation group (SHAM), the MI group, and the ramipril group (RAM). All groups were subjected to thoracotomy under sterile conditions; the MI and RAM groups underwent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. On the second day after surgery, the RAM group was given ramipril (1 mg/kg per day). The rabbits in each group were fed for 12 weeks. The monophasic action potentials of the epicardium, mid-myocardium and endocardium in each group were, respectively, recorded before the MI and at 12 weeks after the MI. Meanwhile, the episodes of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) induced by procedure stimulations were counted, and the changes in L-type Ca flux (Ica-L) were recorded by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.", 
    "202": "The episodes of VT/VF were decreased in the RAM group after MI. At 12 weeks after MI, the transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) in the MI group was prolonged significantly compared with the SHAM and RAM groups. The density of Ica-L in the MI group was significantly lower than that any other group.", 
    "203": "Ramipril manifestly decreases the incidence of VT/VF after MI in rabbits, and the mechanism may be associated with its inhibitory effect on electrical remodeling after MI.", 
    "204": "Dent's disease type 1 is an X-linked tubular disease caused by mutations in the renal chloride channel CLCN-5, and it is characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure. Several cases have been described in which the only presenting symptoms were asymptomatic proteinuria, and focal segmental or global glomerulosclerosis. The renal failure in these patients may be caused by hypercalciuria and persistent proteinuria. Therefore, angiotensin converse enzyme inhibitor and thiazides could be useful. Our aim is to report the effects of these drugs in two novel mutations patients with Dent's disease type 1. In this report, no significant correlations between dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and calciuria and no significant correlations between proteinuria and dosage of enalapril were detected. This is important since these are polyuric patients and these drugs could be dangerous to their renal function.", 
    "205": "Almost 75 million American adults have hypertension. Advances in antihypertensive therapy have dramatically reduced cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal events. Among the effective pharmacotherapies are inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS). In 2007, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) sponsored a comparative effectiveness review (CER) of the two most common renin system inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), to answer the following three Key Questions for adults with essential hypertension: do ACEIs and ARBs differ in their (1) blood pressure control, cardiovascular events, quality of life, and other outcomes; (2) safety, tolerability, persistence with therapy, or treatment adherence; and (3) effects within important subgroups of patients? This 2007 CER was updated in 2011 to incorporate the significant additional direct comparison research published in the interval and to include direct renin inhibitors (DRIs), which are the newest class of RAS inhibitors. The results of the updated CER included 97 studies (36 new since 2007) directly comparing ACEIs versus ARBs and 3 studies directly comparing DRIs to ACEIs or ARBs. The strength of evidence remained high for equivalence between ACEIs and ARBs for blood pressure lowering, and for superiority of ARBs over ACEIs for short-term adverse events (primarily cough). The new evidence did not strengthen the conclusions regarding long-term cardiovascular outcomes, quality of life, progression of renal disease, medication adherence or persistence, rates of angioedema, or differences in key patient subgroups; the strength of evidence for these outcomes remained low to moderate. Evidence on the comparative effectiveness of DRIs versus either ACEIs or ARBs was limited to 3 studies with 2,049 patients and did not allow definitive conclusions on any of the included outcomes. Few studies involved a representative patient sample treated in a typical clinical setting over a long duration; treatment protocols had marked heterogeneity; and significant amounts of data about important outcomes and patient subgroups were missing. Given the clinical and economic importance of these medications, the ongoing investment in research, and the remaining areas of uncertainty, we sought to create a prioritized research agenda representing the interests of diverse stakeholders in order to address the remaining areas of uncertainty.",

    "208": "We screened abstracts and full text articles of identified references for eligibility and reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for evidence on benefits and harms of CKD treatments. We reviewed RCTs and observational studies for evidence regarding possible benefits and harms of CKD screening or monitoring. For all included RCTs, data were extracted, quality was rated, and strength of evidence was graded. Evidence on the benefits and harms of CKD treatments was quantitatively synthesized when possible. Additional evidence on CKD screening and monitoring was qualitatively described.", 
    "209": "We found no RCTs of CKD screening or monitoring. In treatment RCTs, several interventions significantly reduced clinical events. In patients with proteinuria, nearly all with diabetes and hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (relative risk [RR], 0.60, 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.83) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (RR 0.77, 95 percent CI, 0.66 to 0.90) significantly reduced risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) versus placebo. In patients with microalbuminuria who had cardiovascular disease or diabetes with other cardiovascular risk factors, ACEI treatment reduced mortality risk (RR 0.79, 95 percent CI, 0.66 to 0.96) versus placebo. In individuals with hyperlipidemia and impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance, HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) reduced risk of mortality (RR 0.80, 95 percent CI, 0.68 to 0.95), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke compared with placebo. However, limited data addressed whether these effects differed between patients with and without CKD or as a function of CKD severity. In RCTs that directly compared different treatments, including high dose versus low dose, combination versus monotherapy, and strict versus standard control, it was unclear whether intensification of treatment improves clinical outcomes. Reporting of study withdrawals and adverse events was limited. Based on treatment RCT findings and additional indirect data, including high CKD prevalence, low CKD recognition and limited CKD monitoring in usual care, uncertain sensitivity of screening and monitoring measures for CKD, and insufficient evidence on CKD screening and monitoring harms, the overall benefits of CKD screening and monitoring are unclear. The likelihood of benefit, if present, appears to be greater in specific subgroups. For example, individuals not being treated with ACEIs or ARBs who have cardiovascular disease or diabetes combined with other cardiovascular risk factors may benefit from screening for albuminuria. Individuals not being treated with a statin who have hyperlipidemia and no cardiovascular disease may benefit from screening for impaired eGFR. Younger patients, and those without diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or obesity, are the least likely to benefit from CKD screening. Individuals with impaired eGFR and at high risk for cardiovascular complications who are not being treated with ACEIs or ARBs may benefit from monitoring for incident albuminuria.", 
    "210": "No trials directly show a benefit for CKD screening or monitoring. The likelihood of benefit, if present, appears to be greater in specific subgroups. Screening and monitoring harms are poorly described. In selected CKD patients, ACEI or ARB treatment reduces ESRD risk, ACEI treatment reduces mortality risk, and statin treatment reduces risk of mortality, MI, and stroke. Many of these patients may already warrant treatment with these therapies regardless of CKD status. Many knowledge gaps remain, and additional research should increase understanding regarding optimal approaches to CKD screening, monitoring, and treatment.", 
    "211": "The recently discovered angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase 2 (ACE2)-[Angiotensin-(1-7)(Ang-(1-7)]-Mas receptor axis has an opposing function to that of the ACE-Angiotensin II (Ang II)-Angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor axis. Ang-(1-7) is present in the kidneys at concentrations comparable to those of Ang II and is associated with vasodilation, modulation of sodium and water transport, and stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Ang-(1-7) also acts as a physiological antagonist of Ang II by counterbalancing the Ang II-mediated intracellular signaling pathway. In a hypertensive model, increased ACE and decreased ACE2 along with a higher ACE/ACE2 ratio in hypertensive kidneys appeared to favor Ang II generation, leading to hypertensive renal damage. In addition, the administration of a selective Ang-(1-7) receptor blocker or an ACE2 inhibitor was associated with worsening of hypertension and renal function. Ang-(1-7)-mediated increases in renal blood flow were abolished by blockade of the Mas receptor and by inhibition of prostaglandin release and NO in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in Wistar-Kyoto controls. Further research on the function of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis could lead to a novel target for inhibiting kidney disease progression.", 
    "212": "Many guidelines suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists (collectively referred to as renin, angiotensin, aldosterone system blockers (RAAS blockers)) are the preferred treatment for hypertension in most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Improving the recognition of CKD with the introduction of eGFR reporting was intended to have more patients recognized with and treated for this disease. To quantify this, we examined trends in RAAS-blocker use over an 88-month period before and after routine eGFR reporting in southwestern Ontario, Canada. An intervention analysis with seasonal time-series modeling on linked health administrative data for 45,361 ambulatory residents with CKD (eGFR stages 3-5) older than 65 years was performed with a primary outcome of RAAS-blocker usage. The reporting of eGFR was associated with a significant increase in the use of RAAS blockers, as the prescription rate was 571 per 1000 patients with CKD prior to reporting but improved to 607 per 1000 after reporting. There was a significant increase in RAAS-blocker use attributable to eGFR reporting of 19 per 1000 CKD patients. Since about 8% of the adult population has CKD, this equates to about 15,200 new patients receiving RAAS-blocker treatment by 1 year after the introduction of eGFR reporting in community laboratories. Thus, eGFR reporting contributes to improved, guideline-appropriate care of older patients with CKD.",

Ten hospitals were the source of 692 patients with HF (EF < 40%). Physicians of patients with HF were classified as adherent to EBG if the patient chart audit showed they were on a beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor (ACE-I), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Patients were classified as adherent to EBG if MEMS pill caps were used appropriately more than 80% of the time. Sixty-three percent of physicians prescribed evidence-based medications that were adherent to clinical practice guidelines. New York Heart Association (NYHA) III patients were less likely to be adherent (P < 0.001), as were those with renal disease (P < 0.001) and asthmatics (P < 0.001). Nonadherent physicians were less likely to treat patients with beta-blockers (39% vs 98%, P < 0.001) and ACE-I or ARBs (71% vs 98% P < 0.001). Thirty-seven percent of patients prescribed evidence-based therapy failed to use the MEMS pill cap bottles appropriately and were more likely a minority or higher NYHA class. Adherence to evidence-based therapy is less than optimal in HF patients based on a combination of both physician and patient nonadherence.",

The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, a large practice-based clinical trial, made it possible to examine consequences of observed changes in potassium during care in conventional practice settings. Normokalemic participants randomized to chlorthalidone (C) versus amlodipine or lisinopril as a first-step drug were stratified by year-1 potassium. Postyear-1 outcomes among hypokalemics (potassium, <3.5 mmol/L) and hyperkalemics (potassium, >5.4 mmol/L) were compared with normokalemics (potassium, 3.5-5.4 mmol/L). Year-1 hypokalemia incidence was 6.8%; incidence in C (12.9%) differed from amlodipine (2.1%; P<0.001) and lisinopril (1.0%; P<0.01). Hyperkalemia incidence (2.0%) was greater in lisinopril (3.6%) than in C (1.2%; P<0.01) or amlodipine (1.9%; P<0.01). Coronary heart disease occurred in 8.1% with hypokalemia, 8.0% with normokalemia, and 11.1% with hyperkalemia. Overall, mortality was higher in hypokalemics than in normokalemics (Cox hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.02-1.44]) with statistically significant (interaction, P<0.01) disparity in hazard ratios for the 3 treatment arms (hazard ratios, C=1.21, amlodipine=1.60, lisinopril=3.82). Hyperkalemia was associated with increased risk of combined cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.15-2.18]) without significant treatment interactions. In conventional practice settings, the uncommon appearance of hyperkalemia was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Hypokalemia was associated with increased mortality; however, the statistically significant heterogeneity in hazard ratios across treatment groups strongly suggests that the observed increase in mortality is unrelated to the specific effects of C. Thus, for most patients, concerns about potassium levels should not influence the clinician's decision about initiating hypertension treatment with low-moderate doses of thiazide diuretics (12.5-25.0 mg of C).",

In this study, the cardio-protective effects and potential mechanisms of fasudil, a selective ROCK inhibitor, on diabetic cardiomyopathy were investigated in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model. Eight weeks after diabetes was induced by a single tail vein injection of 60 mg/kg STZ, rats were administered long-term fasudil or captopril as a control over a four-week period. Similar to the effect of captopril, fasudil treatment significantly protected against STZ-induced hemodynamic, histopathologic changes and decreased serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase. Moreover, fasudil significantly down-regulated ROCK I mRNA expression and ROCK activity, reduced cardiac collagen deposition, and decreased the incidence of apoptosis and ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression. Additionally, fasudil potently elevated superoxide dismutase activity and suppressed the extent of lipid peroxidation in sera and hearts of diabetic rats. Our findings indicated that long-term treatment with fasudil could improve cardiac dysfunction, attenuate myocardial injury and prevent pathological changes in a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy. These effects could be attributed to regulation of antioxidative activities, suppression of myocardial hypertrophy, apoptosis, fibrosis and subsequent cardiac remodeling. These results may help to expand the clinical application of fasudil for diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

High doses of orally administered perindopril have previously been shown to improve fracture healing in a mouse femur fracture model. In this study, perindopril was administered directly to the fracture area with the goal of stimulating fracture repair. Three months after being ovariectomized (OVX), tibial fractures were produced in Sprague-Dawley rats and subsequently stabilized with intramedullary wires. Perindopril (0.4 mg/kg/day) was injected locally at the fractured site for a treatment period of 7 days. Vehicle reagent was used as a control. Callus quality was evaluated at 2 and 4 weeks post-fracture.

Newly woven bone was arranged more tightly and regularly at 4 weeks post-fracture. The ultimate load increased by 66.1 and 76.9% (p<0.01), and the bone volume over total volume (BV/TV) increased by 29.9% and 24.3% (p<0.01) at 2 and 4 weeks post-fracture, respectively.

The main pharmacokinetic endpoints were area under the plasma ACT-077825 concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and the terminal half-life (t(1/2)). The pharmacodynamic endpoints included immunoactive active renin (iAR) plasma concentrations and plasma renin activity (PRA). Standard laboratory and safety data were collected.",

    "248": "We previously reported that a peptide-enriched soy sauce-like seasoning called fermented soybean seasoning (FSS) demonstrated antihypertensive effects both in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory substances (9 kinds of dipeptides and a nicotianamine) were identified from FSS. In the present study, we clarified the mechanisms underlying the antihypertensive effects of FSS in SHR. FSS was divided into the nicotianamine fraction and the peptide fraction. The peptide fraction was found to exert a more prevalent antihypertensive effect than the nicotianamine fraction in SHR. Among the peptides, we identified Gly-Tyr and Ser-Tyr as the 2 primary substances in FSS that contributed to the antihypertensive effect in SHR. These peptides were neither degraded by acid nor gastrointestinal proteases, and were absorbed into the circulating blood. FSS (2000 mg/kg) exerted ACE inhibitory activity in the lung of rats and provided a decrease (P= 0.0067) in the level of serum aldosterone after a single oral administration in SHR, resulting in the antihypertensive effect. The antihypertensive mechanism was found to be similar to therapeutic ACE inhibitors and other food-derived ACE inhibitory peptides, which are in wide use and are recognized as safe.",

The peptide exhibited an ACE-inhibitory activity with an IC(50) value of 20 \u03bcM. Also, the peptide could efficiently quench the (1,1)-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radicals and exhibit high anticoagulation activity with a complete inhibition at 100 mM. Moreover, the peptide has a good stability against protease digestion. These results suggest that the peptide RVPSL may have potential to be used in nutraceuticals and functional food. Practical Application:\u2002 The present research revealed a novel multifunctional peptide hydrolyzed from egg white protein. The peptide RVPSL was not only able to block the amplification of the coagulation cascade, but also able to inhibit ACE activity.",

The low-fat cheeses made with TL1 and TRFM showed higher moisture contents than the cheeses made with TL4, full-fat, and low-fat cheese controls. The low-fat cheeses made with TL1 and TL4 had higher customer preferential scores similar to full-fat cheese control in the sensory evaluation. Additionally, the low-fat cheeses fermented with TL1, TL4, and TRFM for 4 h had higher 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical-scavenging and ferrous ion-chelating abilities than the cheeses fermented with the starters for 8 h, full-fat, and low-fat cheese controls.

In this study, egg protein (egg white and egg yolk proteins) hydrolysates were produced with gastrointestinal enzymes (pepsin and pancreatin) or nongastrointestinal enzymes (thermolysin and alcalase), and fractionated by ultrafiltration and cation exchange chromatography. Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidant activities, amino acid composition and molecular weight distribution were studied, and the physicochemical properties were related with the bioactivities. Our results showed that egg protein hydrolysates produced with non-GI enzymes (thermolysin and alcalase) showed significantly higher ACE inhibitory activity, whereas similar or even lower antioxidative activities, than those of hydrolysates produced with GI enzymes. ACE-inhibitory activity significantly correlated with the amino acid composition, especially the proportion of positively charged amino acid, whereas antioxidant activities correlated with the proportion of low molecular weight peptides under 500 Da.

    "254": "The carboxyl terminal-extended form of angiotensin I, proangotensin-12, was recently identified in rat tissues including the small intestine, cardiac ventricles, and kidneys. Single administration of proangiotensin-12 exerts vasoconstrictor and pressor effects, probably by conversion to angiotensin II; however, there are currently no data available about the subacute effects of proangiotensin-12. In the present study, we examined the effects of prolonged infusion of proangiotensin-12 in conscious rats. Continuous, subcutaneous infusion of 240 pmol/kg/min of proangiotensin-12 gradually elevated blood pressure over 14 days, as did the same dose of angiotensin II. The pressor effects of proangiotensin-12 were abolished by oral administration of losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, or perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Meanwhile, angiotensin II-induced elevation of blood pressure was inhibited by losartan but not by perindopril. Both the plasma aldosterone level and heart weight/body weight ratio were increased by the prolonged infusion of proangiotensin-12, but these increases were attenuated by losartan and perindopril. The present results suggest that proangiotensin-12 infused continuously over 14 days exerts pressor effects accompanied with the elevation of plasma aldosterone and cardiac hypertrophy in an ACE- and angiotensin II type 1 receptor-dependent manner.", 
    "255": "Nearly half of all heart failure (HF) patients have diastolic HF (DHF) or clinical HF with normal or near-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Although the terminology has not been clearly defined, it is increasingly being referred to as HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). The prevalence of HFPEF increases with age, especially among older women. Identifying HFPEF is important because the etiology, pathogenesis, prognosis, and optimal management may differ from that for systolic HF (SHF) or HF with reduced ejection fraction. The clinical presentation of HF is similar for both SHF and HFPEF. As in SHF, HFPEF is a clinical diagnosis. Once a clinical diagnosis of HF has been made, the presence of HFPEF can be established by confirming a normal or near-normal LVEF, often by an echocardiogram. HFPEF is often associated with a history of hypertension, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular stiffness, and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. As in SHF, HFPEF is also associated with poor outcomes. While therapies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers improve outcomes in SHF, there is currently no such evidence of their benefits in older HFPEF patients. In this review recent advances in the diagnosis and management of HFPEF in older adults are discussed.",

However, the arterial blood pressure of normal rats showed no significant changes during long-term oral treatment with high dose JCP (p > 0.05). Furthermore, effect of JCP on angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration of plasma had no significance (p > 0.05), but JCP significantly inhibited the Ang II concentration in RVHs' kidney (p < 0.05).

    "257": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy is idiopathic heart failure occurring in the absence of any determinable heart disease during the last month of pregnancy or the first 5 months postpartum. The incidence varies worldwide but is high in developing nations; the cause of the disease might be a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Diagnostic echocardiographic criteria include left ventricular ejection fraction <0.45 or M-mode fractional shortening <30% (or both) and end-diastolic dimension >2.7 cm/m(2). Electrocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, endomyocardial biopsy, and cardiac catheterization aid in the diagnosis and management of peripartum cardiomyopathy. Cardiac protein assays can also be useful, as suggested by reports of high levels of NT-proBNP, cardiac troponin, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, interferon-\u03b3, and C-reactive protein in peripartum cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of mutations associated with familial dilated-cardiomyopathy genes in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy suggests an overlap in the clinical spectrum of these 2 diseases.Treatment for peripartum cardiomyopathy includes conventional pharmacologic heart-failure therapies-principally diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, vasodilators, digoxin, \u03b2-blockers, anticoagulants, and peripartum cardiomyopathy-targeted therapies. Therapeutic decisions are influenced by drug-safety profiles during pregnancy and lactation. Mechanical support and transplantation might be necessary in severe cases. Targeted therapies (such as intravenous immunoglobulin, pentoxifylline, and bromocriptine) have shown promise in small trials but require further evaluation. Fortunately, despite a mortality rate of up to 10% and a high risk of relapse in subsequent pregnancies, many patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy recover within 3 to 6 months of disease onset.",

    "263": "Angioedema of the intestinal tract is an infrequent but well-described cause of abdominal pain that can occur because of inherited, acquired, allergic, or drug-induced causes. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a genetic disorder that causes recurrent attacks of severe edema of various body parts, including the intestinal tract. Moderate to severe abdominal pain occurs in 43-93% of such attacks due to intestinal edema. Laryngeal edema is a potentially life-threatening manifestation. Failure to recognize and diagnose HAE or other causes of intestinal angioedema can lead to years of delay in diagnosis, and in the case of HAE, often to unnecessary abdominal surgeries. Recognizing the typical history of recurrent attacks of abdominal pain, oropharyngeal/laryngeal angioedema or cutaneous angioedema, family history of similar symptoms, association of attacks with stress or menses, and exacerbation of attacks after administration of estrogens or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will increase diagnostic accuracy. Interdisciplinary treatment is often necessary after the diagnosis of HAE, first with acute management in the emergency room or the intensive care unit, followed by either drug prophylaxis against future attacks using a C1-esterase inhibitor concentrate or attenuated androgens and discontinuation of medications known to trigger attacks. Newer drugs approved for treatment of acute attacks may have future roles in the prevention of attacks if further studies support their efficacy. Gastroenterologists in particular should maintain a high index of suspicion for the possibility of HAE or other causes of intestinal angioedema in patients with a history of recurrent abdominal pain.",

    "265": "Oxidative stress is a molecular dysregulation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. It is characterized by a loss of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Large clinical trials such as HOPE and HPS have not shown a clinical benefit of antioxidant vitamin C or vitamin E treatment, putting into question the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. A change in the understanding of the molecular nature of oxidative stress has been driven by the results of these trials. Oxidative stress is no longer perceived as a simple imbalance between the production and scavenging of ROS, but as a dysfunction of enzymes involved in ROS production. NADPH oxidases are at the center of these events, underlying the dysfunction of other oxidases including eNOS uncoupling, xanthine oxidase and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus NADPH oxidases are important therapeutic targets. Indeed, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) as well as drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibit NADPH oxidase activation and expression. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists (sartans) and aliskiren, as well as spironolactone or eplerenone, have been discussed. Molecular aspects of NADPH oxidase regulation must be considered, while thinking about novel pharmacological targeting of this family of enzymes consisting of several homologs Nox1, Nox2, Nox3, Nox4 and Nox5 in humans. In order to properly design trials of antioxidant therapies, we must develop reliable techniques for the assessment of local and systemic oxidative stress. Classical antioxidants could be combined with novel oxidase inhibitors. In this review, we discuss NADPH oxidase inhibitors such as VAS2870, VAS3947, GK-136901, S17834 or plumbagin. Therefore, our efforts must focus on generating small molecular weight inhibitors of NADPH oxidases, allowing the selective inhibition of dysfunctional NADPH oxidase homologs. This appears to be the most reasonable approach, potentially much more efficient than non-selective scavenging of all ROS by the administration of antioxidants.",

These peptides were RPR, KAPVA and PTPVP and all of them showed significant antihypertensive activity after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats, RPR being the peptide with the greatest in vivo activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the in vivo antihypertensive action of the three peptides from nebulin (RPR) and titin (KAPVA and PTPVP), thus confirming their reported in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. These findings suggest that pork meat could constitute a source of bioactive constituents that could be utilized in functional foods or nutraceuticals.",

    "270": "There is a reciprocal connection between the frontal cortex (FC) and cardiovascular function, and this connection is functionally lateralized. The possible pathophysiological impact of neuroendocrine asymmetries is largely underestimated. Our aim was to examine the activity of soluble (SOL) and membrane-bound (MB) aminopeptidases (APs) involved in the renin-angiotensin system in the peripheral plasma and in the left and right FC, in both untreated (control) and captopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Enzymatic activities were measured fluorometrically using arylamide derivatives as substrates. Captopril reduced systolic blood pressure, but no differences in plasma AP activity were observed between the control and treated SHRs. In contrast, whereas the bilateral pattern (left vs. right differences) of SOL activities did not substantially change in the FC after captopril treatment, the asymmetries observed for MB activities in the FC markedly increased compared with the control group. Moreover, correlations between the AP activities in the plasma and those in the left or right FC were observed. In the control rats, the plasma AP activities correlated significantly with those in the right FC, whereas they correlated with those in the left FC in the captopril-treated group. In both groups (control and captopril), these correlations were negative for the SOL activity but positive for the MB activity. The present results reveal a pattern of bilateral behavior between the nervous and cardiovascular systems. The inverted bilateral behavior after captopril treatment suggests a systematized, lateralized neuroendocrine response representing a regular bilateral behavior that has yet to be analyzed.",

The use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is considered a possible risk factor for the occurrence of angioedema with concomitant administration of tissue plasminogen activator.

Because AcSDKP is hydrolyzed by the N-terminal active site of angiotensin converting enzyme and partially eliminated in urine, its plasma level is a result of a complex balance between its production, hydrolysis by ACE, and renal elimination. In this study, we attempted to establish an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for quantifying AcSDKP-like immunoreactive substance (IS), which is applicable for monitoring plasma AcSDKP levels in healthy subjects and patients with chronic renal failure. Using \u03b2-D-galactosidase-labeled Gly-\u03b3Abu-SDKP as a marker antigen, an anti-rabbit IgG-coated immunoplate as a bound/free separator and 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside as a fluorogenic substrate, a highly sensitive and specific EIA was developed for the quantification of AcSDKP-IS in human plasma. The lower limit of quantification was 0.32\u2009fmol/well, and the sharp inhibition competitive EIA calibration curve obtained was linear between 8.0 and 513\u2009fmol/ml. This EIA was so sensitive that only 10\u2009\u00b5l plasma sample was required for a single assay. The coefficients of variation (reproducibility) for human plasma concentrations of 0.2 and 2.1\u2009pmol/ml were 7.2 and 7.7%, respectively, for inter-assay and 13.3 and 7.8% for intra-assay comparisons.

    "281": "The high prevalence of primary aldosteronism among hypertensives justifies large scale screening by the aldosterone-renin ratio; however, this test is subject to several variables responsible for false-positive results. Functional tests to confirm autonomous aldosterone secretion are commonly used, with the fludrocortisone suppression test considered the gold standard, and saline infusion or captopril challenge, the most practical. However, each of these tests has sub-optimal sensitivity and specificity and none has been so far prospectively validated by comparing the results with the lateralization by adrenal vein sampling and the results of surgery. Their role in confirming the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism due to unilateral adenoma remains incompletely resolved.", 
    "282": "Enalaprilat (Ena.), an angiotensin II (Ang II) converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), can produce some therapeutic effects on hypertension, ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial remodeling in clinic, but its precise mechanism, especially its signaling pathways remain elusive. In this study, cardiac fibroblasts (CFb) was isolated by the trypsin digestion method; a BrdU proliferation assay was adopted to determine cell proliferation; an immunofluorescence assay was used to measure intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS); immunocytochemistry staining and Western blotting assay were used to detect phosphorylated p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p-p38MAPK) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2(1) (TGF-\u03b2(1)) protein expression, respectively. The results showed that Ang II (10(-7) M) stimulated the cardiac fibroblast proliferation which was inhibited by NAC (an antioxidant), SB203580 (a p38MAPK inhibitor) or enalaprilat; Ang II caused an burst of intracellular ROS level within thirty minutes, an increase in p-p38MAPK (3.6-fold of that in the control group), as well as an elevation of TGF-\u03b2(1) meantime; NAC, an antioxidant, and enalaprilat treatment attenuated cardiac fibroblast proliferation induced by Ang II and decreased ROS and p-p38MAPK protein levels in rat cardiac fibroblast; SB203580 lowered TGF-\u03b2(1) protein expression in rats' CFb in a dose-dependent manner. It could be concluded that enalaprilat can inhibit the cardiac fibroblast proliferation induced by Ang II via blocking ROS/P38MAPK/TGF-\u03b2(1) signaling pathways and the study provides a theoretical proof for the application of ACEIs in treating myocardial fibrosis and discovering the primary mechanism through which ACEIs inhibit CFb proliferation.", 
    "283": "Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has become a major therapeutic approach in medicine since the end of the 1970's. Although these molecules were the first RAS blockers to be developed, it would have been physiologically and pharmacologically more pertinent to selectively inhibit renin itself. Indeed, the reaction between renin and its unique substrate, angiotensinogen, is the highly regulated and rate-limiting step of the RAS. The development of direct renin inhibitors (DRI) has been a slow and complex process and the synthesis of the first orally active DRI, aliskiren, was only achieved in the 2000's. Its pharmacological profile in patients with hypertension, diabetic nephropathy or heart failure, in addition to experimental evidence, suggests that aliskiren may be of value for the management of cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, the long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled, morbidity/mortality trial, ALTITUDE, which included 8,600 patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria and a high cardiovascular risk already treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs was terminated in December 2011 because of futility and an increased incidence of serious adverse events in the aliskiren 300 mg arm. Other long-term studies are still ongoing to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of aliskiren to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and in elderly individuals (\u226565 years) with systolic blood pressure of 130 to 159 mmHg, no overt cardiovascular disease, and a high cardiovascular risk profile. In the meantime, according to the European Medicines Agency recommendations, aliskiren should not be prescribed to diabetic patients in combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.",

The highest ACEI activity was found in the F75 fraction, which appeared to contain a single 20.7-kDa protein, suggesting enrichment to or near to homogeneity. The ACEI activity of the F75 fraction was moderately thermostable (-20-60 \u00b0C), showed >80% activity across a broad pH range of 4-12 (optimal at pH 4-5) and appeared as a competitive inhibitor of ACE (K(i) of 9.1 \u00d7 10(-5) mg protein/mL).

Two patients died during follow-up and escalation of treatment was required in 18 patients after a median period of 2.5 years. Escalation of therapy was also associated with an increase in 6 MWTd. In addition, FC improved on DTT and oxygen saturation, increased, both at rest and peak exercise. This effect was more pronounced in the patients with the lowest baseline oxygen saturation at rest.",

Physical examination, nail fold capillaroscopy and immunological tests can differentiate primary forms from secondary ones. The treatment is based on preventing exposure to cold, emotional stress and the administration of certain drugs and, if attacks are present, vasodilators, prostaglandin analogues and anticoagulants may be given.

The aims of this study were to examine the kinetic profiles of IS in humans at a steady state after multiple doses of L-Trp, a precursor of IS, and the in vivo interaction of IS with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril, whose active metabolite is a substrate of organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) in rats. First, 12-h kinetics after single doses of Trp (2, 4, and 8 g) were examined in two healthy volunteers. Second, 24-h kinetics after a single dose of 2 g of Trp was studied in six volunteers. Third, 35-h kinetics after single and multiple doses of 2 g of Trp were examined in five volunteers. In anesthetized rats, quinapril or probenecid, an inhibitor of OATs, was given intravenously before IS, and blood and urine samples were taken until 90 min. Trp and IS concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Ultrafiltration was used to measure serum unbound IS concentrations. Renal tubular secretion of IS accounted for more than 90% of its renal clearance in the steady state of serum IS levels after multiple doses in humans. In animals, the serum area under the curve of IS increased in conjunction with a decrease in renal clearances after coadministration of IS with quinapril or probenecid. It is concluded that quinapril may inhibit the urine excretion of IS via OAT3-mediated renal tubular transport in patients with CKD.",

It is difficult to achieve the optimized renin angiotensin aldosterone system suppression with currently available antihypertensive agents, because ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics all activate the compensatory feedback mechanism that increases renin release and increase plasma renin activity. The first orally active direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) were developed in 1980s, including enalkiren, remikiren, and zankiren. However, poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, less bioavailability (<2%), short half life, and low potency hindered the development of these compounds.

This study was conducted to assess the protective effect of hydration alone in the prevention of CIN after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients on diuretics or ACEI. This randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Chamran Hospital, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, during the years 2006-2007. The study patients were divided into four groups, each group containing 60 patients. Patients in groups A and B were on regular treatment with ACEI (captopril) and patients in groups C and D were on regular diuretic (furosemide) therapy. About 36 h before PCI, captopril in group A and furosemide in group C were discontinued. The serum creatinine (Cr) levels were measured at the time of performing PCI and 24 h and 48 h after PCI in all patients. All patients received 1 mL/kg/h normal saline (0.9%) 12 h before and 24 h after PCI. The occurrence of CIN after PCI was diagnosed based on the following formula: Cr level after PCI - Cr level before PCI. If this value was greater than 0.5 mg/dL, it was coded as one and if the value was less than 0.5 mg/dL, it was coded as zero. The mean difference was analyzed and compared among the four groups by the ANOVA test. Three patients (5%) in group A, two patients (3.3%) in group B, two patients (3.3%) in group C and one patient (1.6%) in group D had a >0.5 mg/dL difference in serum Cr.

The resulting expression level of the protein accounted for about 31% of cellular protein at a temperature of 37\u00b0C, IPTG concentration of 0.6mM and induction time of 7h. The inclusion bodies were washed, separated from the cells, and solubilized with urea. After purification by affinity chromatography, the recombinant protein was recovered with a high purity of about 90%. Molecular weight of the recombinant protein was measured using Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Peptide IYPR was obtained by cleavage of the recombinant protein with trypsin and the IC(50) value was 61 mg/L. The antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was also investigated. Single oral administration of this peptide in 10-week old SHRs resulted in a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure to 50 mm Hg at 4 h. The data obtained provide a good reference for further development of peptide Ile-Tyr-Pro-Arg into an effective antihypertensive agent for prevention and treatment of hypertension.",

We assessed substances/combinations and investigated pulse pressure and target blood pressure attainment (TBPA) using three different recommendations [Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP), Swiss Society of Hypertension (SSH), European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology (ESH-ESC)]. Secondarily, we compared TBPA attained by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/diuretic (D), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)/D and calcium channel blocker (CCB)/D with any other dual therapy and investigated whether Ds/beta-blockers (BBs) or Ds/renin angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (RAAS-Is) lead to higher TBPA. Finally, we assessed the impact of drug administration, practical work experience, location and specialization of GPs on TBPA.",

Our pilot study employed a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover methodology with intention-to-treat analysis. Thirty-three men with idiopathic oligospermia were randomized to start either daily oral lisinopril 2.5 mg (n = 17) or daily oral placebo (n = 16). Lisinopril was found to cause a normalization of seminal parameters in 53.6% of the participants. Although the mean ejaculate volume was unchanged (P \u2265 0.093), the total sperm cell count and the percentage of motile sperm cells increased (P \u2264 0.03 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas the percentage of sperm cells with abnormal morphology decreased (P \u2264 0.04). The pregnancy rate was 48.5%, and there was no serious adverse drug event. It is concluded, albeit cautiously, that prolonged treatment with 2.5 mg/day of oral lisinopril may be well tolerated in normotensive men with idiopathic oligospermia, may improve sperm quantity and quality, and may enhance fertility in approximately half of those treated.", 
    "337": "Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in many pathological processes including chronic liver diseases. Various factors, such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), insulin resistance (IR), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute reciprocally to promote angiogenesis. Blockade of RAAS by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker (ARB) markedly attenuates liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) along with suppression of angiogenesis, IR, and ROS. Aldosterone (Ald), a downstream component of AngII, is also involved in these processes, and a selective Ald blocker (SAB) significantly suppressed the progression of chronic liver diseases. The IR status itself has shown to directly accelerate the progression of chronic liver diseases whereas inhibition of ROS by iron chelator suppressed it through augmentation and inhibition of neovascularization. The combination therapy of ACE-I/ARB/SAB with other clinically used agents, such as interferon, imatinib mesylate, vitamin K, iron chelator, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) exerted more potent inhibitory effects on the development of liver fibrosis and HCC than the treatment using a single agent alone. Collectively, the anti-angiogenic treatment targeting RAAS, IR, ROS with clinically available agents may become a new therapeutic strategy against the progression of chronic liver diseases.",

Overall, 29 primary care physicians--who are also participating in an electronic health record research program--participated in a semi-structured interview about their prescribing decisions. Physicians were categorized into two groups based on their patterns of prescribing antihypertensive drugs: physicians who predominantly prescribe diuretics, and physicians who predominantly prescribe drug classes other than diuretics. Cases of hypertension that were newly started on antihypertensive therapy were purposely selected from each physician's electronic health record database. Chart stimulated recall interview, a technique utilizing patient charts to probe recall and provide context to physician decision-making during clinical encounters, was used to elucidate reasons for treatment choices. Interview transcripts were synthesized using content analysis techniques, and factors influencing physicians' decision making were inductively generated from the data.", 
    "340": "We identified three themes that differentiated physicians who predominantly prescribe diuretics from those who predominantly prescribe other drug classes for the initial treatment of mild to moderate hypertension: a) perceptions about the efficacy of diuretics, b) preferred approach to hypertension management and, c) perceptions about hypertension guidelines. Specifically, physicians had differences in beliefs about the efficacy, safety and tolerability of diuretics, the most effective approach for managing mild to moderate hypertension, and in aggressiveness to achieve treatment targets. Marketing strategies employed by the pharmaceutical industry and practice experience appear to contribute to these differences in management approach.",

Accompanying this has been the appearance of adverse drug events, including hospitalizations associated with thiazide-associated hyponatremia (HTAH). Hyponatremia is a common yet often overlooked side effect of this drug class. Identification of HTAH risk factors may aid in creating strategies to prevent hospitalizations. This is a retrospective, case-controlled study of 10,805 patients (1802 cases, 9003 controls) examining HTAH risk factors within a group-model integrated-care organization. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (odds ratio [OR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-1.93), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.16-2.00), and hypokalemia (OR, 40.94; 95% CI, 26.46-66.33) were most associated with HTAH. Urinary tract infection (UTI), type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were also found to be HTAH risk factors. Potassium supplements (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44-0.83) and weight (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.93) had protective effects. A predictive model was developed to determine overall HTAH risk given the presence of individual risk factors. Age, weight, hypokalemia, GERD, type 2 diabetes, UTI, and ACE inhibitor use independently correlated with an increased risk of HTAH. This model may be applied in clinical practice to guide thiazide prescribing.",

An efficient and rapid method was established for the preparation and transformation of competent cells of Escherichia coli. After extraction and purification, hPEPT1/hPEPT2-pcDNA3 was transfected into HeLa cells by the liposome transfection method, respectively. HeLa-hPEPT1/hPEPT2 cells were selected by measuring the protein expression and the uptake activities of JBP485 and Gly-Sar. A simple and rapid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous determination of JBP485 and Gly-Sar in biological samples. The Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) values of Gly-Sar uptake by the hPEPT1 and hPEPT2-expressing transfectants were 1.03 mM and 0.0965 mM, respectively, and the K(m) values of JBP485 uptake were 1.33 mM for PEPT1 and 0.144 mM for PEPT2. The uptake of Gly-Sar was significantly inhibited by JBP485 with a K(i) value of 8.11 mM (for PEPT1) and 1.05 mM (for PEPT2). Maximal uptake of Gly-Sar were detected at pH 5.8 (for PEPT1) and pH 6.5 (for PEPT2), suggesting that both HeLa-hPEPT1 and HeLa-hPEPT2 were H(+) dependent transporters. Stably transfected HeLa-hPEPT1/HeLa-hPEPT2 cells were constructed successfully, and the functions of hPEPT1/hPEPT2 were identified using their substrates, JBP485 and Gly-Sar.

The TAC-induced increase in the number of proliferating Ki67(pos) cardiomyocytes and noncardiomyocytes was reduced more potently by ACEI than by ARB. Four days of drug treatment induced a significant increase in Scal(pos)/VEGFR1(pos) endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in all animals in the treated SHAM groups. After 1 day of aortic constriction, only ramipril increased EPC numbers; after 5 weeks, telmisartan monotherapy did not change the EPC levels compared to vehicle or the combination therapy but raised it compared to ramipril.

    "386": "Bladder hypertrophy and dysfunction are well-known bladder responses to outlet obstruction (i.e. urodynamic overload). Cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure are also caused by hemodynamic overload, and many basic and clinical studies suggest that the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has a crucial role in load-induced cardiac pathogenesis. The similarity of the response of the heart and the bladder to overload suggests that angiotensin II (AngII) may have a similar regulatory role in pathological remodeling, such as muscle growth and collagen production of the obstructed bladder. Previous in vitro studies show that angiotensin I is converted to AngII by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or chymase, which exists in the human bladder. In addition, many studies using contractile responses to AngII, autoradiography, radioreceptor assay and mRNA expression demonstrate the presence of AngII receptor in the bladder from various animals and the human. Recent evidence indicates that AngII is released from bladder smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in response to a repetitive stretch stimulus, and subsequently activates AT1 in an autocrine fashion. This AT1 activation has been shown to mediate heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor gene expression and to increase the DNA synthesis rate of bladder SMCs. Consistent with this in vitro study, previous studies and our preliminary data suggest the usefulness of AT1 antagonists or ACE inhibitor in bladder outlet obstruction of the rabbit and rat. Taken together, the local RAS contributes to structural and functional alterations in the bladder after obstruction.",

She received multiple chemotherapies, including six cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine), followed by radiation therapy to left inguinal areas for a total of 30.6 Gy in 17 fractions; she obtained complete remission. Two years later, L.R. had disease relapse in the mediastinum and received two cycles of ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin) followed by etoposide and ifosfamide. She then received BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) as a conditioning regimen and underwent autologous bone marrow transplant. Her post-transplant course was complicated by cytomegalovirus antigenemia, aspergillus pneumonia, and congestive heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%-25%. She was treated with an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and a beta-blocker (carvedilol) with improvement of her LVEF to 30%-35%. A follow-up chest x-ray showed an increase in the size of the anterior mediastinal adenopathy suspicious for relapse of lymphoma, and at the same time she was also found to be 5 weeks pregnant. Given her cardiomyopathy, significant obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and cancer recurrence, L.R. was advised by her gynecologist that the pregnancy was very high risk and might not be viable. The oncologists advised her to terminate the pregnancy within the first trimester, as she needed salvage radiotherapy treatment to the mediastinum and chemotherapy treatments that might endanger the fetus. However, the patient decided to continue with the pregnancy. A multidisciplinary team-which included a cardiologist, oncologist, high-risk obstetrician, pharmacist, and nurse practitioner-was then involved to provide care during the pregnancy. A social worker was also solicited to help with home and financial issues because L.R. was a single mother with a 2-year-old son. L.R. was treated with carvedilol and furosemide, with monthly cardiology clinical follow-up during the first and second trimesters, then every 2 weeks starting with the 28th week, and weekly thereafter until delivery. Between visits, she notified the clinic for symptoms of heart failure exacerbation and was seen as necessary. The possible in utero effects of both medications were discussed with the patient. L.R. had a normal uncomplicated pregnancy and delivered a 6-pound, 10-ounce healthy boy at 39 weeks via vaginal delivery and was discharged home 2 days later. A week after delivery, L.R. presented to the cardiology clinic in good spirits and was excited to show pictures of her newborn baby. She had no cardiac complaints and the repeat echocardiogram showed an unchanged LVEF of 30%-35%.",

In patients with hypertension, ACEIs and ARBs provide similar blood pressure effects and no differences were seen in final health outcomes.

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored weekly. Morphometry of structural changes in the aortic wall was studied in hematoxylin/eosin, orcein and picrosirius red sections. Aortic NADPH activity and superoxide production was evaluated. Aortic gelatinolytic activity was determined by in situ zymography, and MMP-2, MMP-14, and tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP)-2 levels were determined by gelatin zymography, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. 2K1C hypertension was associated with increased ACE activity, which decreased to normal after 10 weeks. We found increased aortic collagen and elastin content in the early phase of hypertension, which were associated with vascular hypertrophy, increased vascular MMP-2 and MMP-14 (but not TIMP-2) levels, and increased gelatinolytic activity, possibly as a result of increased vascular NADPH oxidase activity and oxidative stress. These results indicate that vascular remodeling of renovascular hypertension is an early process associated with early increases in MMPs activities, enhanced matrix deposition and oxidative stress.

    "440": "A 41-yr-old Japanese male was treated for hypertension and hypokalemia for 5 yr. Primary aldosteronism was diagnosed by a furosemide and upright posture test and a captopril challenge test. Computed tomography imaging showed a 5-mm left-sided adrenal mass. Adrenal vein sampling demonstrated overproduction of aldosterone from the left adrenal gland. Long-term treatment with SP normalized the plasma aldosterone concentration. After discontinuation of SP, the patient's blood pressure, serum potassium level, and plasma aldosterone concentration remained in the normal range. The associated cardiac hypertrophy also improved and continued to resolve even after discontinuation of SP. Although the left adrenal gland tumor was still present on computed tomography after treatment, a furosemide and upright posture test, a captopril challenge test, and a saline loading test produced no evidence of PA. Adrenal vein sampling demonstrated no sign of lateralization.",

For mechanical ventilation, we observed an odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) of 9.42 (4.24-20.9); for tube feeding, OR = 22.3 (8.91-55.8); for dysphagia, OR = 13.1 (4.66-36.7); and for tracheostomy, OR = 26.8 (8.02-89.3). After adjustment of potential confounders including GCS and mRS on admission, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors, and H2 blockers, all the adjusted OR (ORa) remained significant. For mechanical ventilation, the minimum ORa was 3.72 (95% CI: 1.68-8.26) when adjusted for GCS. For both dysphagia and tracheostomy, mRS reduced OR to 7.46 (95% CI: 3.34-10.6) in the case of dysphagia with an ORa of 16.2 (95% CI: 4.98 to 52.8) for tracheostomy.

    "446": "Management of acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation (STEMI) remains a challenge for academic institutions. There are numerous factors at play from the time electrocardiogram is obtained to the time the patient arrives to a catheterization laboratory and the balloon is inflated. Academic hospitals that are located in large urban centers have to deal with staff living long distances from the facility, and therefore, assembling the catheterization team after-hours and on the weekends becomes a difficult task to achieve. There are other factors that contribute to time delays, such as, administering electrocardiograms in timely fashion, having emergency physicians activate the catheterization team, instead of contacting the cardiologist to discuss the case, and other time-sensitive factors. All of the aforementioned issues contribute to the delay. Yet, primary percutaneous coronary intervention is clearly demonstrated as the modality of choice in treatment of STEMI, which improves patient's morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is imperative that institutions do all they can to improve their protocols and meet the core measures in the treatment of STEMI patients, including the door-to-balloon time of less than 90 minutes. Our institution started a quality improvement program for STEMI care in 1993 and has showed progressive improvement in use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and other medication, culminating in 95% to 100% use of these medications in 2003-2004, when we operated in accordance with the Get With The Guidelines program. Door-to-balloon time in less than 90 minutes became a new phase in our quality improvement process, and we achieved 100% compliance in the last 2 years.",

We review some abnormalities of the kidneys, progressive renal failure and disorders of bladder function from which general conclusions can be drawn.", 
    "448": "The published literature was reviewed and augmented with material from our institutional databases. For renal function the CAKUT (congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract) database at University College London Hospitals was used, which includes 101 young adult patients with CAKUT in whom the urinary tract has not been diverted or augmented. For bladder function some data are from patient records at Boston Children's Hospital.", 
    "449": "Adolescents who grow up with the burden of a major congenital anomaly have an overwhelming desire to be normal. Many achieve high levels of education and occupy a wide range of employment scenarios. Babies born with damaged kidneys will usually experience improvement in renal function in the first 3 years of life. Approximately 50% of these cases will remain stable until puberty, after which half of them will experience deterioration. Any urologist who treats such patients needs to test for proteinuria as this is a significant indicator of such deterioration. In its absence, the urologist must have a reasonable strategy for seeking a urological cause. The most effective management for nephrological renal deterioration is with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which slow but do not prevent end stage renal failure. Renal deterioration is generally slower in these patients than in those with other forms of progressive renal disease. The bladder is damaged by obstruction or by functional abnormalities such as myelomeningocele. Every effort should be made to stabilize or reconstruct the bladder in childhood. A dysfunctional bladder is associated with or causes renal damage in utero, but continued dysfunction will cause further renal damage. Bladder function often changes in puberty, especially in boys with posterior urethral valves who may experience high pressure chronic retention. Dysfunction is managed with antimuscarinic drugs, clean intermittent self-catheterization and intestinal augmentation. Adult urologists must be able to manage the long-term problems associated with these treatments.", 
    "450": "Pediatric conditions requiring management in adolescence are rare but have major, lifelong implications. Their management requires a broad knowledge of pediatric and adult urology, and could well be a specialty in its own right. Therefore, adult urologists must remain aware of the conditions, the problems that they may encounter and the special management required for these patients to live normal lives.", 
    "451": "Despite the use of angiotensin blockers, chronic kidney diseases still progress. New therapeutic approaches aim to strengthen and to complete angiotensin blocker effects. Endothelin receptor antagonists, in addition to angiotensin blockers reduce blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion in diabetic nephropathies but can induce fluid overload. A second therapeutic approach consists in preventing the development of interstitial renal fibrosis which is a prognostic factor of CKD. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays a major role in this process. Several molecules such as pirfenidone, microARN are in development to block TGF-beta or its downstream signaling pathways. Another approach aims to promote resolution of inflammation and renal repair Interesting experimental results were obtained with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and with methyl of bardoxolone in humans.", 
    "452": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem. It is therefore important to slow its progression and to treat its complications. Regardless of the causal nephropathy, arterial hypertension and proteinuria are the major progression factors of CKD. Thus, optimal control of blood pressure, reduction of proteinuria by using rennin angiotension system inhibitors can slow the progression of CKD. This effect can be enhanced by reducing sodium intake. The recent recommendations suggest that blood pressure should not be higher than 130/80 mmHg and proteinuria should not exceed 0,5 g/day. The consequences of advanced stages of the CKD have to be diagnosed and treated early: anemia, abnormal bone metabolism, hyperkalemia, fluid overload, metabolic acidosis... A particular emphasis has to be given to cardiovascular complications and risk factors. Monitoring data are well defined by the actual recommandations. Nephrologist can provide a set of recommended intervention to the primary care physician. The most accepted criterion of initiation of dialysis, in absence of clinic uremic manifestation is a glomerular filtration rate lower than 7 ml/min/1,73m2. Psychological and medical preparation of the patient to dialysis is essential. The possibility of renal transplantation should be evaluated during the following of patient with CKD", 
    "453": "Angiotensin II plays an important role in regulating blood pressure. Moreover, angiotensin II directly promotes organ damage by inducing expression of various genes, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 precursors. Blockade of angiotensin II has been shown to not only lower blood pressure, but also to prevent cardiovascular and renal dysfunction and fibrosis. Inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and MMP-9 has also been shown to prevent cardiovascular and renal damage. A mast cell-produced enzyme, chymase, generates angiotensin II and also converts precursors of TGF-\u03b2 and MMP-9 to their active forms. Chymase also strongly promotes accumulation of inflammatory cells. These multiple functions of chymase may play an important role in the development and promotion of various diseases. In fact, chymase inhibitors have been shown to prevent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, intestinal inflammation, and adhesion formation after surgery and cardiovascular and renal damage. On the other hand, chymase inhibitors, unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II blockers, have no blood pressure-lowering effect despite blocking angiotensin II formation. Thus, chymase inhibitors may be useful for preventing damage to various organs via multiple mechanisms without lowering blood pressure.", 
    "454": "There is an urgent need to improve upon Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments. Limitations of existing drugs are that they target specific downstream neurochemical abnormalities while the upstream underlying pathology continues unchecked. Preferable treatments would be those that can target a number of the broad range of molecular and cellular abnormalities that occur in AD such as amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and hyperphosphorylated tau-mediated damage, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well more systemic abnormalities such as brain atrophy, impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebrovascular disease. Recent pre-clinical, epidemiological, and a limited number of clinical investigations have shown that prevention of the signaling of the multifunctional and potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang II) may offer broad benefits in AD. In addition to helping to ameliorate co-morbid hypertension, these drugs also likely improve diminished CBF which is common in AD and can contribute to focal A\u03b2 pathology. These drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARAs) may also help deteriorating cognitive function by preventing Ang II-mediated inhibition of acetylcholine release as well as interrupt the upregulation of deleterious inflammatory pathways that are widely recognized in AD. Given the current urgency to find better treatments for AD and the relatively immediate availability of drugs that are already widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, one of the largest modifiable risk factors for AD, this article reviews current knowledge as to the eligibility of ACE-inhibitors and ARAs for consideration in future clinical trials in AD.",

The study had a crossover design: after 3 months, both groups were changed (group A* stopped and group B* started atorvastatin treatment). Nitric oxide (NO), total antioxidant status (TAS), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and peroxide concentrations as well as FMD were measured before, after 3 and after 6 months of treatment. Atorvastatin added to existing treatment decreased BP in both groups.",

    "459": "The aim of this work was to determine the multifunctional properties of flaxseed protein-derived cationic peptide fractions. Alcalase hydrolysis of flaxseed protein fractions liberated cationic peptides, which were separated into two major fractions (FI and FII) by chromatography using a cation-exchange column. Due to their cationic property, the peptide fractions bound and inactivated calmodulin (CaM, a negatively charged enzyme activator protein) with concomitant inhibition of CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE); this activity was substantially reduced as CaM concentration increased. Enzyme kinetics studies showed competitive inhibition of CaMPDE by FI and FII with enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constants of 0.0202 and 0.0511\u00a0mg/ml, respectively. Only the FII peptides showed multifunctional activities by inhibiting CaMPDE, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and renin. Separation of FII peptides by reverse phase HPLC resulted in eight fractions (FII-2 to FII-9) that inhibited the activities of CaMPDE, ACE, and renin but this multifunctional activity was more pronounced in FII-6. From LC-MS analysis, identified peptides present in FII fraction had molecular size range of 330-735\u00a0Da, which suggests potential for increased absorption. Potential peptide sequences were identified for each of the HPLC fractions and shown to contain either lysine or arginine as the positively charged amino acid residue. The multifunctional properties of the cationic peptide fractions can potentially enhance their use in targeting multiple symptoms of cardiovascular disease, considering that the excessive levels of CaM, CaMPDE, renin and ACE play important roles in enhancing progression and intensity of chronic human diseases.",

After this period, the hearts of the rats were removed and processed for biochemical and histopathologic studies. The antioxidant parameters superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were estimated. A diagnosis of MI was confirmed with antioxidant parameters and histopathologic findings. In MI control groups, histopathologic indicators were found to be statistically higher than those in drug groups; an increase in histopathologic indicators of MI correlates with significant decreases in SOD and CAT levels, and an increase in MDA level. Histopathologic grades of MI indicators were significantly higher in MI group that did not receive any cardioprotective medications in comparison with MI groups that received LAC, RAM, and VAL. Each of the three medications favorably modulated most of the biochemical and histopathologic parameters observed. No significant difference existed with regard to any of the estimated parameters in the rat groups that received medications without MI induction.

    "477": "Diabetic nephropathy is the major cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Although the renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors have a beneficial effect on diabetic nephropathy independently of their effects on blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II levels. This suggests that the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) is also involved in the disease. To study the role of the KKS in diabetic nephropathy, mice lacking either the bradykinin B1 receptor (B1R) or the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) have been commonly used. However, because absence of either receptor causes enhanced expression of the other, it is difficult to determine the precise functions of each receptor. This difficulty has recently been overcome by comparing mice lacking both receptors with mice lacking each receptor. Deletion of both B1R and B2R reduces nitric oxide (NO) production and aggravates renal diabetic phenotypes, relevant to either lack of B1R or B2R, demonstrating that both B1R and B2R exert protective effects on diabetic nephropathy presumably via NO. Here, we review previous epidemiological and experimental studies, and discuss novel insights regarding the therapeutic implications of the importance of the KKS in averting diabetic nephropathy.",

The present study investigates whether brief ACE inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) provides long-term protection against the LV and kidney damage induced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME). SHR received the ACE inhibitor enalapril (n = 36) or tap water (n = 36). In all, 12 control and treated SHR were sacrificed after 2 weeks and remaining rats were taken off-treatment. After a 2-week washout, 12 controls or previously treated SHR were sacrificed and remaining rats were treated with L-NAME ((control (Con)+L, enalapril (Enal)+L) for 10 days. At sacrifice, blood pressure was recorded via carotid artery cannulation in anesthetized rats, and blood, the kidney and LV were isolated for analysis. LV mass and arterial pressure were significantly reduced by enalapril. LV mass showed a persistent reduction throughout the study. In LV, prior enalapril treatment provided significant (P<0.05) protection against L-NAME-induced increases in proliferating cells (Con+L: 11 \u00b1 10.0 mm(2) vs. Enal+L: 4 \u00b1 4.4 mm(2)), interstitial fibrosis (Con+L: 3 \u00b1 2.5% vs. Enal+L: 1 \u00b1 1.0%) and tissue macrophages (Con+L: 12 \u00b1 9 mm(2) vs. Enal+L: 5 \u00b1 3.6 mm(2)). In the kidney, prior enalapril treatment protected against L-NAME-induced interstitial fibrosis and vascular injury. There was no difference in glomerular size or glomerulosclerosis regardless of prior treatment. Plasma creatinine and urea were significantly increased in L-NAME treated rats. This study suggests that brief ACE inhibition confers protection against future heart and kidney injury, even in the absence of continued antihypertensive treatment.",

    "483": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is present in 69% of patients with a first myocardial infarction, in 77% of patients with a first stroke, in 74% of patients with chronic heart failure, and in 60% of patients with peripheral arterial disease. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antihypertensive drug therapy reduces cardiovascular events in patients aged 65 to 79 years. In the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial, patients aged \u2265 80 years who were treated with antihypertensive drug therapy had, at 1.8-year follow-up, a 30% reduction in fatal or nonfatal stroke (P = 0.06), a 39% reduction in fatal stroke (P = 0.05), a 21% reduction in all-cause mortality (P = 0.02), a 23% reduction in cardiovascular death (P = 0.06), and a 64% reduction in heart failure (P < 0.001). Although the optimal blood pressure (BP) treatment goal in the elderly has not been determined, existing epidemiologic and clinical trial data suggest that a reasonable therapeutic BP goal should be < 140/90 mm Hg in persons aged < 80 years and a systolic BP of 140 to 145 mm Hg if tolerated in persons aged \u2265 80 years. Nonpharmacologic lifestyle measures should be encouraged both to prevent development of hypertension and as adjunctive therapy in persons with hypertension. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and calcium channel blockers have all shown benefit in reducing cardiovascular events in randomized trials. The choice of specific drugs depends on efficacy, tolerability, presence of specific comorbidities, and cost. Adverse effects from treatment, such as electrolyte disturbances, renal dysfunction, and excessive orthostatic BP reduction, should be avoided.",

    "486": "A 74 year-old woman taking lisinopril for hypertension was treated with IV rt-PA for right hemispheric acute ischemic stroke. Shortly after completion of the rt-PA infusion, she developed asymmetric angioedema involving the tongue and left lower lip. No emergent airway intervention was needed. Following treatment with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids, the edema resolved within 24 h. The patient made an excellent recovery from the ischemic stroke.",

Identification of high risk features may help guide decisions regarding early definitive airway management.", 
    "488": "There is an increased evidence for the association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and kidney diseases. Recent epidemiological studies strongly suggest that HCV infection is a risk factor for proteinuria and/or impaired renal function. Type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) associated with type II cryoglobulinemia is the most frequent renal disease, and non-cryoglobulinemic MPGN and membranous glomerulonephritis are less frequently associated with active HCV infection. The pathogenesis of these lesions are related to the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli, and recently it has been described that toll-like receptor 3 could have a pathogenic role establishing a link between viral infection and glomerulonephritis. Patients with HCV-related glomerulopathies should be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in association or not with angiotensin receptor blockers, as well as with anti-HCV therapy. The latter relies on a combined antiviral therapy of standard or pegylated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin. We recommend the treatment of patients for at least 48 weeks, and the continuation of antiviral therapy, even in the absence of a decrease in HCV RNA concentration of 2-log at week 12. Ribavirin doses should be adapted according to creatinine clearance in order to avoid its main side effect, i.e. hemolytic anemia. Combined antiviral therapy and immunosuppression (cyclophosphamide or rituximab with steroids) may be the treatment of choice for patients with severe renal disease, i.e. nephrotic syndrome and/or progressive renal failure, or diseases that are refractory to anti-HCV therapy alone.", 
    "489": "It has recently been suggested that angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease the risk of cancer. However, studies to date have not investigated esophageal carcinoma. Therefore, we investigated the inhibitory effect of ACE inhibitors on growth of esophageal carcinoma xenografts. We used the EC9706 cell line, which expresses the highest vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA level, to establish xenografts in 21 BALB/c nude mice. The mice were then randomly allocated to receive normal saline, perindopril (4 mg/kg), or benazepril (6 mg/kg). Five weeks later, the nude mice were sacrificed and all tumors were dissected and weighed. The number of microvessels was counted by immunostaining endothelial cells for CD31 and the microvessel density was assessed. The EC9706 cell line showed the highest expression of VEGF mRNA of four esophageal squamous cell carcinoma lines. After treatment, the average tumor inhibitory rate in the benazepril group was 45.4%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Similar findings were observed when we used tumor weight as an index for tumor growth inhibition (P < 0.05). By contrast, there was no significant difference between the perindopril group and the control group (P > 0.05). The benazepril group appeared to show less vascularization than the control group (P < 0.05), but we did not find a significant difference between the perindopril group and the control group (P > 0.05). The EC9706 cell line showed the highest expression of VEGF mRNA level of the four esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines examined. Benazepril inhibited the growth of esophageal carcinoma in vivo. The potential mechanism of benazepril seems to involve suppression of new vessel formation. Therefore, benazepril could be used as an effective agent for the treatment of esophageal carcinoma.",

    "494": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are important for the treatment of hypertension as they can decrease the formation of vasopressor hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) and elevate the levels of vasodilating hormone bradykinin. It is observed that bradykinin contains a Ser-Pro-Phe motif near the site of hydrolysis. The selenium analogues of captopril represent a novel class of ACE inhibitors as they also exhibit significant antioxidant activity. In this study, several di- and tripeptides containing selenocysteine and cysteine residues at the N-terminal were synthesized. Hydrolysis of angiotensin I (Ang I) to Ang II by ACE was studied in the presence of these peptides. It is observed that the introduction of L-Phe to Sec-Pro and Cys-Pro peptides significantly increases the ACE inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the introduction of L-Val or L-Ala decreases the inhibitory potency of the parent compounds. The presence of an L-Pro moiety in captopril analogues appears to be important for ACE inhibition as the replacement of L-Pro by L-piperidine 2-carboxylic acid decreases the ACE inhibition. The synthetic peptides were also tested for their ability to scavenge peroxynitrite (PN) and to exhibit glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-like activity. All the selenium-containing peptides exhibited good PN-scavenging and GPx activities.",

Here we show that the BMP receptor activin-like kinase 3 (Alk3) is elevated early in diseased kidneys after injury. We also found that its deletion in the tubular epithelium leads to enhanced TGF-\u03b21-Smad family member 3 (Smad3) signaling, epithelial damage and fibrosis, suggesting a protective role for Alk3-mediated signaling in the kidney. A structure-function analysis of the BMP-Alk3-BMP receptor, type 2 (BMPR2) ligand-receptor complex, along with synthetic organic chemistry, led us to construct a library of small peptide agonists of BMP signaling that function through the Alk3 receptor. One such peptide agonist, THR-123, suppressed inflammation, apoptosis and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program and reversed established fibrosis in five mouse models of acute and chronic renal injury. THR-123 acts specifically through Alk3 signaling, as mice with a targeted deletion for Alk3 in their tubular epithelium did not respond to therapy with THR-123. Combining THR-123 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril had an additive therapeutic benefit in controlling renal fibrosis. Our studies show that BMP signaling agonists constitute a new line of therapeutic agents with potential utility in the clinic to induce regeneration, repair and reverse established fibrosis.",

Apart from its effects on lipids, statins have been found to reduce postoperative oxidative stress that may partly contribute towards improved graft patency. In addition, certain ACE-inhibitors can promote a pro-fibrinolytic environment, whose role on maintaining graft patency and clinical outcomes warrant further investigation. There is increasing evidence to support the use of combined clopidogrel with aspirin following CABG to improve graft patency, although its impact on reducing postoperative adverse events remains unclear.

Rats (WAG/RijCmcr) were given a single dose of 13 Gy (dose rate of 1.43 Gy/min) of X-irradiation to the thorax. Three structurally-different ACE inhibitors, captopril, enalapril and fosinopril were provided in drinking water beginning 1 week after irradiation. Rats that survived acute pneumonitis (at 6-12 weeks) were evaluated monthly for synthesis of lung collagen.

Treatment with captopril (145-207 mg/m(2)/day) or enalapril (19-28 mg/m(2)/day), but not fosinopril (19-28 mg/m(2)/day), decreased morbidity from acute pneumonitis. Lung collagen in the surviving irradiated rats was increased over that of controls by 7 months after irradiation. This increase in collagen synthesis was not observed in rats treated with any of the three ACE inhibitors. Analysis of the lung morphology at 7 months supports the efficacy of ACE inhibitors against radiation-induced fibrosis. The effectiveness of fosinopril against fibrosis, but not against acute pneumonitis, suggests that pulmonary fibrosis may not be a simple consequence of injury during acute pneumonitis. In summary, three structurally-different ACE inhibitors mitigate the increase in collagen synthesis 7 months following irradiation of the whole thorax and do so, even when therapy is started one week after irradiation.",

    "532": "Oxidant stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In the late 1980s, biological studies demonstrated that oxygen-free radicals oxidize low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, resulting in the creation of foam cells and inciting the cascade of biological events that ultimately result in the formation of atherosclerosis. In vitro studies showed the ability of antioxidant vitamins to scavenge free radicals and block the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein. This data was supported in vivo by early observational studies suggesting the benefit of antioxidants, particularly vitamin E, in the prevention of coronary artery disease. On the basis of these studies, the use of antioxidant supplements by the general population increased substantially and became a multibillion dollar industry. Despite strong biological evidence and promising observational data, more rigorous scientific evaluation did not support a causational relationship between vitamin supplements and lowering coronary artery disease risk. Several prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials showed no benefit and possibly harmful effects. Therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins, which are known to have benefit in preventing and treating atherosclerosis by reducing blood pressure and cholesterol, also have a \"pleiotropic\" effect in reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Advances in molecular biology and the study of ROS led to a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern their production and role in atherogenesis. This progress identified unforeseen pathways by which these drugs favorably alter the balance in ROS production, and have raised possibilities for future targeted therapies in the prevention of atherosclerosis.",

However, these agents only partially prevent cardiovascular and renal morbidity/mortality. Further attempts to improve clinical outcomes have focused on the use of an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB, but this combination has not demonstrated a favorable risk-benefit profile. Direct renin inhibitors provide a more comprehensive blockade of the RAS compared with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and may be of particular benefit in counteracting tissue RAS overactivity.

    "535": "Brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is significantly involved in the roles of the endocrine RAS in cardiovascular regulation. Our studies indicate that the brain RAS participates in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis through sympathetic activation. Inhibition of sympathetic hyperactivity after myocardial infarction through suppression of the brain RAS appears beneficial. Furthermore, the brain RAS modulates the cardiovascular and fluid-electrolyte homeostasis not only by interacting with the autonomic nervous system but also by modulating hypothalamic-pituitary axis and vasopressin release. The brain RAS is also involved in the modulation of circadian rhythms of arterial pressure, contributing to non-dipping hypertension. We conclude that the brain RAS in pathophysiological states interacts synergistically with the chronically overactive RAS through a positive biofeedback in order to maintain a state of alert in diseased conditions, such as cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Therefore, targeting brain RAS with drugs such as renin or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or receptor blockers having increased brain penetrability could be of advantage.",

However, the mechanisms explaining why the reduction in ACE2 is associated with the development of glomerular lesions have still to be fully clarified. We hypothesized that ACE2 may regulate the renoprotective actions of ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ACE2 deficiency on the renal production of ANP. We evaluated molecular and structural abnormalities, as well as the expression of ANP in the kidneys of ACE2-deficient mice and C57BL/6 mice. We also exposed renal tubular cells to AngII and Ang-(1-7) in the presence and absence of inhibitors and agonists of RAS (renin-angiotensin system) signalling. ACE2 deficiency resulted in increased oxidative stress, as well as pro-inflammatory and profibrotic changes. This was associated with a down-regulation of the gene and protein expression on the renal production of ANP. Consistent with a role for the ACE2 pathway in modulating ANP, exposing cells to either Ang-(1-7) or ACE2 or the Mas receptor agonist up-regulated ANP gene expression. This work demonstrates that ACE2 regulates renal ANP via the generation of Ang-(1-7). This is a new mechanism whereby ACE2 counterbalances the renal effects of AngII and which explains why targeting ACE2 may be a promising strategy against kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy.",

Diabetic nephropathy is associated with glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, mesangial cell expansion, followed by albuminuria and reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Indeed, no promising therapeutic options are available in the present clinical scenario to manage efficiently the diabetic nephropathy. Nevertheless, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II-AT(1) receptor blockers are currently employed to improve structural and functional status of the diabetic kidney. These interventions, however, are not optimal in improving overall outcomes of diabetic nephropathy. Hence, there is a continuing need of developing promising therapeutic interventions to manage this insidious condition adequately. Recent bench and clinical studies strongly suggest the potentials of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) agonists in the management of diabetic nephropathy by keeping the view that renal lipid accumulation-induced lipotoxicity is one of risk factors for nephropathy during chronic diabetes mellitus. As inflammation, oxidative stress and dyslipidemia are common consequences of renal dysfunction, PPAR\u03b1 agonists could serve as promising therapeutic agents for controlling the progression of diabetic nephropathy. In fact, fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic agent acts as a PPAR\u03b1 agonist, reduced renal lipotoxicity, inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress, and subsequently prevented the symptoms of diabetic nephropathy. However, fenofibrate has been shown to cause renal dysfunction in established renal disorders. The present review addressed the rationale of employing PPAR\u03b1 agonists in the management of diabetic nephropathy.",

Captopril can induce a sharp decrease in CL intensity from the triangular AuNPs-catalyzed luminol system. Under the selected experimental conditions, a linear relationship was obtained between the logarithm of CL intensity and the logarithm of concentration of captopril in the range of 23.0-920 nM, and the detection limit at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 for captopril was 4.6 nM. The as-prepared triangular AuNPs were easier to synthesize, stable at a wider pH range and high ionic strength, and exhibited a high selectivity and an excellent sensitivity toward captopril. The applicability of the proposed method has been validated by determining captopril in commercial pharmaceutical formulations and human urine samples with satisfactory results. The recoveries for captopril in spiked samples were found to be between 95.0% and 103.5%. The method shows promise for routine control analysis of pharmaceutical preparations and human urine samples. Moreover, based on the CL spectra, UV-vis spectra and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements, a possible CL mechanism was proposed. The mechanism of high selectivity toward captopril is supposed to originate from the tight binding of the sulphydryl groups of captopril to the active site of the as-prepared triangular AuNPs, leading to oxygen-related radicals cannot easily be generated from H(2)O(2) on the surface of triangular AuNPs.",

    "572": "The role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease and in hypertensive disease above all, is complex. Several studies confirm that activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), through increase in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II), is closely related to local vascular inflammation. Over the BP lowering effects of anti-hypertensive treatments, several ancillary effects for every class may be found, distinguishing the various drugs from one another. Given the pro-inflammatory effects of Ang II and aldosterone, agents that interfere with the components of RAAS, such as ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone or the more selective eplerenone), represent logical therapeutic tools to reduce vascular inflammation and cardiovascular risk, as suggested in large clinical trials in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Regarding ACE inhibitors, actually there is no convincing evidence indicating that ACEi's reduce plasma levels of major inflammatory markers in hypertension models. Lack of evidence concerns especially these inflammation markers, such as fibrinogen of CRP, which are less closely related to atherosclerotic disease and vascular damage and conversely are affected by several more aspecific factors. Results obtained by trials accomplished using ARBs seem to be more univocal to confirm, although to great extent, these is an anti-inflammatory effect of drugs blocking AT1 receptor. In order to strictly study the effects of blockage of RAAS on inflammation, future studies may explore different strategies by, for example, simultaneously acting on the ACE and the AT1 angiotensin receptors.",

It is currently estimated that nearly 15% of the general population has some degree of renal damage, a figure that reaches 50% in at-risk subgroups. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors represent the agents of choice to control hypertension and reduce urinary albumin excretion, thereby delaying renal function deterioration. Greater blockade of the RAAS either by the combined use of multiple drugs or by supramaximal doses of single agents may provide greater renal protection. Furthermore, it has been proposed especially in the presence of proteinuria. However, at this time there is insufficient evidence to routinely recommend this therapeutic approach in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present article examines the currently available evidence and practical implications of pharmacological disruption of RAAS activity for renal protection.",

Furthermore, they have proven their role in delaying the worsening of renal function in patients with chronic renal disease. Over the last few years their use to prevent the new onset of diabetes has come to the forefront. Post-hoc analyses of large multi-center clinical trials such as the Captopril Prevention Project and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation have suggested that their use may delay or prevent the onset of diabetes. However many of these results are based on secondary analyses and few prospective clinical trials exist. In the two prospective trial so far conducted regarding the use of ACEi and ARB as a means to diabetes prevention the effects of these drugs compared to lifestyle modifications have been minimal and do not yet warrant their use to this effect. While there is strong evidence for modulation the Renin-Angiotensin System in patients with hypertension, coronary heart disease and renal dysfunction the evidence for preventing diabetes remains scarce and will need to be investigated further.", 
    "575": "Guidelines for the treatment of hypertension allow a wide range of choices to the physicians; however some differences are present about the preferred drugs to start treatment. The most important aim remains an adequate decrease of blood pressure, something not perfectly obtained in the general population, but some classes of anti-hypertensive drugs could show protective effects on cardiovascular events, which are independent from blood pressure levels (the so called effects beyond blood pressure control). In this context antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system may represent an important help for the physicians, keeping in mind the preclinical studies showing the central role of the renin-angiotensin system not only in the regulation of blood pressure but also in the atherothrombotic processes. The demonstration of an additional favourable effect of renin-angiotensin system blockers is not so obvious and frequently debated in the literature. Evidence-based medicine suggests that in patients at moderate/high cardiovascular risk it is difficult to have clear evidence of a specific advantage of some drug classes with respect to the others. However renin-angiotensin system blockers maintain compelling indications in particular cardiovascular situations; in addition analysis of intermediate end points, such as microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, and arterial stiffness, gives further support to a drug-based anti-hypertension strategy. Last but not least, the optimal safety profile of these drugs, in particular of angiotensin II receptor blockers and renin inhibitors, allows their use in the very early stage of the hypertensive situation, as suggested by recent clinical trials.",

Thus, antioxidant strategies may be important in immune regulation and in limiting inflammation. Surprisingly, large clinical trials have shown that ROS scavenging by antioxidant vitamins is ineffective or even harmful in spite of the fact that reactive oxygen species themselves are pro-inflammatory, regulate immune system and enhance atherosclerosis. Therefore, there is a need of novel, more specific antioxidant and anti-inflammatory approaches aimed on prevention of ROS formation, by targeting specific molecular pathways involved in ROS generation and their activation of pro-inflammatory cascades. Potential targets include the NADPH oxidases (Nox enzymes), xanthine oxidase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and mitochondrial oxidases. Nox enzymes play central role, as they can stimulate other enzymatic sources of ROS. The interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress is discussed in the context of adipose tissue, perivascular inflammation and role of the central nervous system in immune regulation. All of the above participate in \"brain-vessel axis\" critical in the pathogenesis of numerous pathologies. Role of cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-17 or IL-6 and their links to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production are discussed. Statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, block upstream signaling of Nox activation, including MAP kinase signaling or G protein activation, which contribute to their clinical effectiveness.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are a well-established first-line treatment. ACE-I delay fibrosis, but little is known about their molecular effects on cardiomyocytes. We investigated the effects of the ACE-I delapril on cardiomyocytes in a mouse model of heart failure (HF) after MI. Mice were randomly assigned to three groups: Sham, MI, and MI-D (6 weeks of treatment with a non-hypotensive dose of delapril started 24h after MI). Echocardiography and pressure-volume loops revealed that MI induced hypertrophy and dilation, and altered both contraction and relaxation of the left ventricle. At the cellular level, MI cardiomyocytes exhibited reduced contraction, slowed relaxation, increased diastolic Ca2+ levels, decreased Ca2+-transient amplitude, and diminished Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments. In MI-D mice, however, both mortality and cardiac remodeling were decreased when compared to non-treated MI mice. Delapril maintained cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation, prevented diastolic Ca2+ overload and retained the normal Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile proteins. Delapril maintained SERCA2a activity through normalization of P-PLB/PLB (for both Ser16- PLB and Thr17-PLB) and PLB/SERCA2a ratios in cardiomyocytes, favoring normal reuptake of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, delapril prevented defective cTnI function by normalizing the expression of PKC, enhanced in MI mice. In conclusion, early therapy with delapril after MI preserved the normal contraction/relaxation cycle of surviving cardiomyocytes with multiple direct effects on key intracellular mechanisms contributing to preserve cardiac function.",

    "590": "The Combination Therapy of Hypertension to Prevent Cardiovascular Events (COPE) trial demonstrated that the calcium-channel blocker benidipine-based combination therapies with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), a \u03b2-blocker, or a thiazide diuretic (thiazide) were similarly effective in preventing cardiovascular events and achieving the target blood pressure (BP; <140/90\u2009mm\u2009Hg). We further evaluated the efficacy and safety of these combination therapies in older (\ue2f665 years) and younger (<65 years) hypertensive patients. In this sub-analysis of the COPE trial 3293 patients (1533\ue2f665 years old and 1760 <65 years old) were randomly assigned to receive benidipine-based therapy with an ARB, a \u03b2-blocker or a thiazide. In each group, the average BP did not differ among the three treatment groups. The incidence of the primary cardiovascular composite end point in the older group was higher than in the younger group (12.7 vs. 8.3 per 1000 person-years, P=0.023). The primary composite cardiovascular end point, achievement (%) of target BP, and cardiovascular hard composite end points were similar among the three treatment groups. However, the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals in older patients were 2.74 (1.08-6.96; \u03b2-blocker vs. thiazide, P=0.022) for fatal and non-fatal stroke, and 2.47 (1.03-5.91; \u03b2-blocker vs. ARB, P=0.043) for new-onset diabetes. Thus, benidipine combined with an ARB, a \u03b2-blocker, or a thiazide was similarly effective in preventing cardiovascular events and achieving the target BP in both older and younger hypertensive patients. Further studies will be necessary to evaluate the usefulness of benidipine combined with a \u03b2-blocker in terms of the incidence of stroke and new-onset diabetes in older patients.", 
    "591": "Antagonism of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is exerted through angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. These drugs have been successfully tested in numerous trials and in different clinical settings. The original indications of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers have progressively expanded from the advanced stages to the earlier stages of cardiorenal continuum. To optimize the degree of blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, dose uptitrations of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists or the use of a dual blockade, initially identified with the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists, have been proposed. The data from the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study do not support this specific dual blockade approach. However, the dual blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor antagonists with direct renin inhibitors is currently under investigation while that based on an aldosterone blocker with any of the previous three drugs requires more evidence beyond heart failure. In this review, we revisited potential advantages of dual blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in arterial hypertension and diabetes.",

Twenty-five abdominally obese patients (aged 54.4\u00b17.3 years; 14 women) with hypertension/prehypertension were enrolled in a 7-month (two 3-month treatment periods separated by a 1-month washout), randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover clinical trial comparing C+L vs H+L. Endothelial function, measured by digital reactive hyperemic index (RHI), circulating oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), 8-isoprostane, and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were obtained at baseline, post-period 1, post-washout, and post-period 2. Analyses were adjusted for baseline measurements by analysis of covariance, with robust variance estimation for confidence intervals and P values. C+L treatment compared to H+L treatment significantly improved RHI (0.74, 95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.19, P\u2003=.001). This difference persisted after adjustment for the change in systolic blood pressure. No significant treatment differences were observed for oxLDL, 8-isoprostane, or ADMA. These data provide evidence that independent of blood pressure-lowering, C+L therapy improves endothelial function to a greater extent than H+L therapy. Levels of oxidative stress were not significantly different between treatments, suggesting that other mechanisms may be responsible for the improvement in endothelial function.",

The number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes was decreased in the BMSC and ACEI groups, and even further in the combined group (P < 0.05). IGF-1 expression was up-regulated in the BMSC and combined groups (P < 0.05 versus BC), but not in the ACEI group.

This study aimed to identify the factor or factors leading to BNP elevation and to clarify the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) on changes in BNP levels in patients with repaired TOF. Plasma BNP levels and hemodynamic data derived from cardiac catheterization were analyzed. In addition, longitudinal BNP levels and ACE-I dosages were analyzed for patients administered ACE-I. For 31 patients with repaired TOF, who mainly had RV dilation, log BNP levels were significantly correlated with the RV end-diastolic volume index (P = 0.02) as well as ventricular volume and pressure (P < 0.01). For 11 patients medicated with ACE-I, BNP levels were significantly lower at the time of maximal ACE-I dosage than at the time of minimal dosage (P < 0.01). Furthermore, BNP levels decreased as the ACE-I dosage per body weight increased (P < 0.01). In conclusion, elevation of BNP in patients after TOF repair could reflect volume and pressure load in the RV end-diastolic phase, and ACE-I may reduce BNP levels in a dose-dependent manner.",

Recently, angiotensin AT(1) receptor blockers have been demonstrated to be effective in patients with atherosclerotic disease, but the exact mechanisms of these blockers are still controversial. Atherosclerotic plaques are characterized by cholesterol ester accumulation and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1) expression, which are both parameters of degeneration of macrophage-derived foam cells. We examined the effects of angiotensin AT(1) receptor blockers on the formation of foam cells from macrophages. When macrophages from a human cell line were stimulated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), the angiotensin AT(1) receptor blockers candesartan and losartan attenuated the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol ester and the increases in mRNA and protein levels of ACAT-1. Moreover, the increase in oxLDL-induced ACAT-1 was reduced by AG1478, an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Additionally, oxLDL up-regulated the protein level of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a ligand of the EGF receptor. Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme affected neither cholesterol ester accumulation nor the expression of ACAT-1. Although oxLDL itself increased the secretion of angiotensin II, the amount of secreted angiotensin II was insufficient to induce expression of ACAT-1 protein. Thus, we first demonstrated that angiotensin AT(1) receptor blockers suppress ACAT-1 expression and cholesterol ester accumulation through an oxLDL-activated EGF receptor, but it is unclear how oxLDL activates angiotensin AT1 receptor in an angiotensin II-independent manner. The therapeutic mechanism of angiotensin AT(1) receptor blockers for atherosclerosis may be at least partially explained by our present results.",

Arterial tonometry (central pressures and time-tension index, TTI); impedance cardiography (steady-state hemodynamics), and ultrasound (carotid flow) were performed at rest and during supine bicycle exercise at 30 and 60 watts. At rest, both V and C lowered TTI similarly (7% to 9%, P = .05 compared with L, in part because they lowered blood pressure (3 to 7/3 to 4 mm Hg). V lowered central systolic pressure, augmentation pressure (AP), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR, all P < .02); C lowered heart rate but not central systolic pressure or SVR. During exercise, V persistently lowered central systolic pressure, AP, and SVR, whereas C did not. Neither drug affected exercise responses or carotid blood flow. Adding V or C to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor reduced cardiac workload by different mechanisms: vasodilation and reduced central blood pressure with V and lower heart rate with C.",

    "648": "The role of aldosterone in the pathogenesis of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases has been clearly shown in congestive heart failure and endocrine hypertension due to primary aldosteronism. In resistant hypertension, defined as a failure of concomitant use of three or more different classes of antihypertensive agents to control blood pressure (BP), add-on therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists is frequently effective, which we designate as \"MR-associated hypertension\". The MR-associated hypertension is classified into two subtypes, that with elevated plasma aldosterone levels and that with normal plasma aldosterone levels. The former subtype includes primary aldosteronism (PA), aldosterone-associated hypertension which exhibited elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio and plasma aldosterone levels, but no PA, aldosterone breakthrough phenomenon elicited when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is continued to be given, and obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast, the latter subtype includes obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The pathogenesis of MR-associated hypertension with normal plasma aldosterone levels is considered to be mediated by MR activation by pathways other than high aldosterone levels, such as increased MR levels, increased MR sensitivity, and MR overstimulation by other factors such as Rac1. For resistant hypertension with high plasma aldosterone levels, MR antagonist should be given as a first-line therapy, whereas for resistant hypertension with normal aldosterone levels, ARB or ACE-I should be given as a first-line therapy and MR antagonist would be given as an add-on agent.",

BP control was worse in diabetic patients, but did not differ substantially with co-morbid conditions, except for a better control in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) (P<0.05). The use of \u2265 3 antihypertensive drugs increased with age from 16.1 to 37.8% (P<0.0001) due to a more frequent use of loop diuretics (P<0.0001), thiazides (P<0.0001), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (P<0.0001) and calcium channel blockers (P<0.0001).

A challenge with existing methods is that the user is often required to elicit prior distributions for high-dimensional parameters that model competing bias scenarios. This can render the methods unwieldy. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to adjust for unmeasured confounding that derives default priors for bias parameters for observational studies with binary covariates. The confounding effects of measured and unmeasured variables are treated as exchangeable within a Bayesian framework. We model the joint distribution of covariates by using a log-linear model with pairwise interaction terms. Hierarchical priors constrain the magnitude and direction of bias parameters. An appealing property of the method is that the conditional distribution of the unmeasured confounder follows a logistic model, giving a simple equivalence with previously proposed methods. We apply the method in a data example from pharmacoepidemiology and explore the impact of different priors for bias parameters on the analysis results.",

The number of daily doses is one characteristic of an antihypertensive agent that may affect the adequacy of 24-hour control. One measure of therapeutic coverage is the 24-hour trough-to-peak ratio, which determines the suitability of an agent for once-daily administration. The closer an agent is to a 100% trough-to-peak ratio, the more uniform the 24-hour coverage and therefore blood pressure control. High trough-to-peak ratio, long-acting antihypertensive medications lower blood pressure more gradually, which reduces the likelihood of adverse events attributable to abrupt drug action that occurs with shorter-acting agents. In hypertension, the natural diurnal variation of blood pressure may be altered, including elevated nighttime pressures. An optimal once-daily hypertension therapy would not only lower blood pressure but also normalize any blunted circadian variations in blood pressure. The benefits of once-daily agents with sustained therapeutic coverage may also be explained, in part, by increased patient adherence to simpler regimens as well as lower loss of blood pressure control during virtually inevitable intermittent noncompliance.

Using the fluorogenic substrate V (a substrate of IDE and other metalloproteases), we showed that human serum degraded the substrate V, and the activity was inhibited by adding increasing dose of A\u03b2. The existence of IDE activity was demonstrated by the inhibition of insulin, amylin, or EDTA, and further confirmed by immunocapture of IDE using monoclonal antibodies.

To test the variations of substrate V degradation in humans, we used serum samples from a homebound elderly population with cognitive diagnoses.

In addition to hypertension, RAS blockade may also serve as an effective treatment strategy to control impaired glucose and insulin tolerance and dyslipidemias in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and/or specific cholesterol metabolites have been demonstrated to activate components required for the synthesis [angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)], degradation (ACE2), or responsiveness (angiotensin II type 1 receptors, Mas receptors) to angiotensin peptides in cell types (e.g., pancreatic islet cells, adipocytes, macrophages) that mediate specific disorders of the metabolic syndrome.

As a first step toward achieving this goal, this study was designed to explore risk factor models of preclinical atherosclerosis in a predominantly African American group of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using variables historically associated with endothelial function in nonlupus populations. Fifty-one subjects with SLE but without a history of clinical cardiovascular events were enrolled. At entry, a Framingham risk factor history and medication list were recorded. Sera and plasma samples were analyzed for lipids, lupus activity markers and total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 OH)D) levels. Carotid ultrasound measurements were performed to determine total plaque area (TPA) in both carotids. Cases had TPA values above age-matched controls from a vascular prevention clinic population. Logistic regression and machine learning analyses were performed to create predictive models. 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower, and SLE disease duration was significantly higher in cases. 25(OH)D levels inversely correlated with age-adjusted TPA. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor nonuse associated with case status. Logistic regression models containing ACE inhibitor use, 25(OH)D levels and low-density lipoprotein levels had a diagnostic accuracy of 84% for predicting accelerated atherosclerosis. Similar results were obtained with machine learning models, but hydroxychlo-roquine use associated with controls in these models. This is the first study to demonstrate an association between atherosclerotic burden and 25(OH)D insufficiency or ACE inhibitor nonuse in lupus patients.

    "749": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder associated with a deficiency in C1 inhibitor. More than 200 mutations in this gene, located on chromosome 11, have been identified. Although HAE is often inherited, 20-25% of cases are from new spontaneous mutations and they have no family history of swelling. Decreased C1 inhibitor activity leads to inappropriate activation of multiple pathways, including the complement and contact systems and the fibrinolysis and coagulation systems. Reduced C1 inhibitor activity results in increased activation of plasma kallikrein-kinin system proteases and increased bradykinin levels. Bradykinin is felt to be the main mediator of symptoms in HAE. Patients with HAE have recurrent episodes of swelling of the extremities, abdomen, face, and upper airway. Angioedema involving the gastrointestinal tract can lead to intestinal wall edema, which results in abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laryngeal swelling is life-threatening and may lead to asphyxia. Common triggers of an attack include trauma, stress, infection, menstruation, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Laboratory testing including C4, C1 inhibitor level, and function is needed to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of HAE. The treatment of HAE has improved significantly in recent years with the availability of several safe and effective therapies. Several consensus guidelines have been created to further assist in the management of HAE patients.

Often, CKD and CVD coexist, and patients warrant optimal pharmacotherapy to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular (CV) events. Randomized trials have evaluated the role of antihypertensive therapy and lipid-lowering therapy as means to reduce CVD in patients with CKD. Many clinical trials support the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the CKD population. In addition, many clinical trials have evaluated the role of statin therapy in reducing CV events in early- and late-stage CKD. The struggle with interpreting results from these trials is that there are a number of different CV composite end points and a lack of consistency in defining CKD, especially in some post hoc subanalyses. Overall, ACEI/ARB therapy is supported by the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) and the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) hypertension guidelines and statin therapy is supported by the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III and NKF KDOQI dyslipidemia guidelines to optimally manage patients with CKD and CV risk factors.

Hypertension is one of the most important treatable factors in the prevention of CVD. Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) is a two-domain dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase that is a key regulator of blood pressure as a result of its critical role in the reninangiotensin- aldosterone and kallikrien-kinin systems. Consequently, ACE is an important drug target in the treatment of CVD. ACE is primarily known for its ability to cleave angiotensin-I to the vasoactive octapeptide angiotensin-II, but is also able to cleave a number of other substrates including the vasodilator bradykinin and N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (acetyl-SDKP), a physiological modulator of hematopoiesis. Numerous ACE inhibiors are available clinically, and these are generally effective in treating hypertension. However some adverse effects are associated with ACE inhibition, such as the persistent dry cough and the potentially fatal angioedema. The solution of ACE crystal structures over the last decade has facilitated rational drug design which has contributed to the development of domain-selective ACE inhibitors, the most notable of which include RXP407 (N-domain) and RXPA380 (C-domain), which in principle may herald new therapeutic approaches for ACE inhibition. Additionally, dual inhibitors to ACE and other targets such as neprilysin, endothelin converting enzyme and chymase have been developed. The success of ACE inhibitors has also led to the search for novel inhibitors in food and natural products and the structure guided screening of such libraries may well reveal a number of new ACE inhibitors.",

    "802": "The colossal progress in understanding of vitamin D and phosphate metabolism introduces new perspectives in chronic kidney disease (CKD) therapy. Increasing demand for phosphate excretion per nephron triggers the vicious cycle that leads to increase in FGF-23 and PTH and decrease in vitamin D and Klotho. Restriction of dietary phosphate intake (low phosphate diet) and administration of phosphate binder can be regarded as the most important interventions in this case. Because the vicious cycle is likely activated long before hyperphosphatemia occurs during CKD progression, phosphate restriction would have been more effective if started before serum phosphate levels increased, perhaps as soon as serum FGF-23 levels rose. Phosphate restriction alleviates phosphate overload per nephron and can disrupt the vicious cycle: phosphate restriction can reduce serum FGF-23 levels and increase vitamin D, which in turn increase Klotho expression in kidney and parathyroid glands. Inhibitors of rennin-angiotensin system (rosiglitazone, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and proper vitamin D supplementation may also up-regulate Klotho expression. Increased Klotho in the kidney may improve FGF-23 sensitivity, which further reduce the amount of FGF-23 required for excreting a given amount of phosphate. Increased Klotho in parathyroid may improve the ability of FGF-23 to suppress PTH. Proper supplementation with vitamin D increase the concentration of substrate for local 1,25(OH)2D synthesis 25(OH)D, which directly suppress PTH, increase Klotho, and decrease FGF-23 by proanabolic action on bone. Improving vitamin D status by inhibition of CYP24A is also under evaluation, as well as antibodies against FGF-23, as modern therapies in CKD.",

Division of external urethral sphincter was performed in 1973. In 1974, cystogram showed retrograde filling of left renal tract, which was hydronephrotic. Left ureteric reimplantation was performed. Following surgery, cystogram revealed marked retrograde filling of left renal tract as before. Penile sheath drainage was continued. In 1981, intravenous urography revealed bilateral severe hydronephrosis. Left ureteric reimplantation was performed again in 1983. Blood pressure was 220/140\u2009mm\u2009Hg; this patient was prescribed atenolol. Cystogram showed gross left vesicoureteral reflux. Intermittent catheterisation was commenced in 2001. In 2007, proteinuria was 860 mg/day. This patient developed progressive renal failure and expired in 2012. In a spinal cord injury patient with vesicoureteral reflux, the treatment should focus on abolition of high intravesical pressures rather than surgical correction of vesicoureteric reflux. Detrusor hyperactivity and high intravesical pressures are the basic causes for vesicoureteral reflux in spinal cord injury patients. Therefore, it is important to manage spinal cord injury patients with neuropathic bladder by intermittent catheterisations along with antimuscarinic drug therapy in order to abolish high detrusor pressures and prevent vesicoureteral reflux. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor-blocking agents should be prescribed even in the absence of hypertension when a spinal cord injury patient develops vesicoureteral reflux and proteinuria.",

Insulin, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are involved in glucose, protein, and fat metabolism, which regulates body composition. In body wasting and cachexia, their signaling is impaired and causes anabolic/catabolic imbalance. Important mechanisms include inflammatory cytokines and neurohormonal activation. Remodeled post-receptor insulin, GH, and IGF-1 pathways constitute a potential target for pharmacological treatment in the setting of body wasting and cachexia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists, drugs inhibiting angiotensin II action (angiotensin II antagonists and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme), and testosterone, which interfere with post-receptor pathways of insulin, GH, and IGF-1, were investigated as pharmacological intervention targets and various clinically important implications were reported.

It is often triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, and in contrast to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the regional wall motion abnormality returns to normal within days. Here, we describe a 62-year-old female who presented with acute onset chest pain during treatment for a liver abscess. We presumed a diagnosis of AMI because of ST segment elevation on electrocardiography and elevated cardiac enzyme levels. However, the patient's coronary arteries were normal on angiography, and apical ballooning was seen on echocardiography. A diagnosis of TTC was made, and the patient was managed with intensive cardiopulmonary support using vasopressors in our hospital's medical intensive care unit. The patient's symptoms improved, but persistent severe left ventricular dysfunction was detected on follow-up echocardiography. After 5 weeks, a new apical mural thrombus appeared, and anticoagulation therapy was started. The apical ballooning persisted 3 months later, although the patient's overall ejection fraction was slightly improved. The apical thrombus was completely resolved without any embolic event. Non-adrenergic inotropics can be recommended in TTC with shock, and clinicians should keep in mind the potential risk of thrombus formation and cardioembolism.", 
    "818": "The alveolar epithelium serves as a barrier to the entry of potential respiratory pathogens. Alveolar Type II (TII) cells have immunomodulatory functions, but whether Type I (TI) cells, which comprise approximately 95% of the alveolar epithelium, also play a role in immunity is unknown. Because the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an element of the RAS, has been implicated in lung injury, we hypothesize that TI cells can produce cytokines in response to LPS stimulation, and that this inflammation can be modulated by the RAS. Alveolar TI cells were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rat lungs that had been injured with an intratracheal instillation of LPS. PCR was performed to determine whether TI cells expressed transcripts for TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, or IL-1\u03b2 at baseline and after lung injury. Immunocytochemical and protein analysis detected angiotensin II (Ang II) and ACE2, as well as angiotensin Type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Type 2 receptor (AT2R), in TI cells. To separate cell-specific responses, primary TI cells were isolated, cultured, and exposed to LPS, Ang II, or specific inhibitors of AT1R or AT2R. Cytokine production was assayed by ELISA. LPS stimulated the production of all cytokines, whereas ACE2 and losartan, an AT1R inhibitor, blocked elements of the LPS-induced cytokine response. Primary TI cells produce cytokines when treated with LPS, contain important components of the RAS, and can modulate LPS-induced cytokine production via the RAS, suggesting a role for TI cells in the innate immune response of the lung.",

    "823": "HALT PKD consists of two ongoing randomized trials with the largest cohort of systematically studied patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease to date. Study A will compare combined treatment with an angiotensin-converting inhibitor and receptor blocker to inhibitor alone and standard compared with low blood pressure targets in 558 early-stage disease patients with an eGFR over 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Study B will compare inhibitor-blocker treatment to the inhibitor alone in 486 late-stage patients with eGFR 25-60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). We used correlation and multiple regression cross-sectional analyses to determine associations of baseline parameters with total kidney, liver, or liver cyst volumes measured by MRI in Study A and eGFR in both studies. Lower eGFR and higher natural log-transformed urine albumin excretion were independently associated with a larger natural log-transformed total kidney volume adjusted for height (ln(HtTKV)). Higher body surface area was independently associated with a higher ln(HtTKV) and lower eGFR. Men had larger height-adjusted total kidney volume and smaller liver cyst volumes than women. A weak correlation was found between the ln(HtTKV) and natural log-transformed total liver volume adjusted for height or natural log liver cyst volume in women only. Women had higher urine aldosterone excretion and lower plasma potassium. Thus, our analysis (1) confirms a strong association between renal volume and functional parameters, (2) shows that gender and other factors differentially affect the development of polycystic disease in the kidney and liver, and (3) suggests an association between anthropomorphic measures reflecting prenatal and/or postnatal growth and disease severity.", 
    "824": "We sought to identify novel urinary biomarkers of kidney function in type 2 diabetes. We screened the renal transcriptome of db/db and db/m mice for differentially expressed mRNA transcripts that encode secreted proteins with human orthologs. Whether elevated urine levels of the orthologous proteins correlated with diminished glomerular filtration rate was tested in a cross-sectional study of n = 56 patients with type 2 diabetes. We identified 36 putative biomarker genes in db/db kidneys: 31 upregulated and 5 downregulated. Urinary protein levels of six selected candidates (endothelin-1, lipocalin-2, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, growth and differentiation factor-15, interleukin-6, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1) were elevated in type 2 diabetic patients with subnormal glomerular filtration rate (i.e., <90 ml\u00b7min(-1)\u00b71.73 m(-2)), independent of microalbuminuria, age, sex, race, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. In contrast, urinary levels of fibroblast growth factor were not increased. A composite variable of urine albumin and any of the six candidate markers was associated with subnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate more closely than albumin alone. In addition, urinary endothelin-1, growth and differentiation factor-15, and interleukin-6 were associated with a marker of proximal tubule damage, N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase activity. These results suggest that gene expression profiling in diabetic mouse kidney can complement existing proteomic-based approaches for renal biomarker discovery in humans.",

Adult (11 wk old) male Akita and Akita Agt-Tg mice were treated with two RAS blockers (ANG II receptor type 1 blocker losartan, 30 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (4 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) in drinking water. Same-age non-Akita littermates and Agt-Tg mice served as controls. Blood pressure, blood glucose, and albuminuria were monitored weekly. The animals were euthanized at age 16 wk. The left kidneys were processed for immunohistochemistry and apoptosis studies. Renal proximal tubules were isolated from the right kidneys to assess gene and protein expression. Urinary ANG II and ANG 1-7 were quantified by ELISA. RAS blockade normalized renal Ace2 expression and urinary ANG 1-7 levels (both of which were low in untreated Akita and Akita Agt-Tg), prevented hypertension, albuminuria, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular apoptosis, and inhibited profibrotic and proapoptotic gene expression in RPTCs of Akita and Akita Agt-Tg mice compared with non-Akita controls. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RAS blockade in preventing intrarenal RAS activation, hypertension, and nephropathy progression in diabetes and support the important role of intrarenal Ace2 expression in modulating hypertension and renal injury in diabetes.", 
    "826": "Although enormous progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, it still remains the leading cause of death worldwide. During the last decades, advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of vulnerable plaque progression, coupled with novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, created a new opportunity for progress against cardiovascular disease. It has been demonstrated that inflammation, implicated in all stages of atherosclerosis, is an integral part of vulnerable plaque development and progression, leading eventually to plaque instability. Thus, new diagnostic modalities have been proposed for the detection of local plaque inflammation. Moreover, treatments such as stenting, photodynamic therapy, and novel pharmaceutical agents are under consideration as methods to stabilize the vulnerable plaques by inhibiting inflammation. This review provides an overview of the inflammatory process leading to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the potential clinical strategies that may substantially decrease the incidence of events. We will mention the major impact of local and systemic inflammation on plaque advancing and destabilization, the imaging techniques for early detection of vulnerable plaques and the potential therapeutic strategies.",

A number of factors commonly characterized as \"risk factors\" for atherosclerosis have been identified to facilitate the development of atherosclerosis by decreasing NO bioavailability in the vascular endothelium. The serious clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis (including coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) augment the need of performing the appropriate diagnostic methods to the patients. The most important diagnostic methods include the usage of biochemical markers and the invasive and non-invasive imaging techniques assessing endothelial function. The main drug categories that have been proved to ameliorate the inflammatory state in atherosclerosis are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptors blockers, statins, and antioxidants.", 
    "828": "Carboxylesterases (CESs) located in the intestine play an unique role in the absorption of many drugs especially ester prodrugs. In order to determine the expression and hydrolyzing activity of CESs isozymes (CES1 and CES2) located in rat intestine, the activities of CES1 and CES2 were evaluated by the intestinal S9 incubation with imidapril and irinotecan (CPT-11), the substrates of CES1 and CES2, respectively. The distribution characteristics of CES1, CES2, Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) and Constitutive Androstane Receptor were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or Western blot. Imidaprilat metabolized from imidapril by CES1 was too low to be detected in rat intestinal S9 fractions, while there was little and even no expression of CES1 mRNA in intestinal segments. In contrast, Vmax values for CPT-11 diminished gradually from proximal to distal segments within the rat intestine which was consistent with the mRNA expression level of CES2. These results indicated that CES2 represents the major CESs isoform in the rat complete intestine and decreased from duodenum to colon, whereas the expression of CES1 was too low to influence the metabolism of ester prodrugs. The expression of PXR and CAR decreased slightly along the entire intestine on both mRNA and protein levels which indicated that PXR and CAR may be one of the major factors which contribute to the expression of CES1 and CES2. Thus, the knowledge about the characteristic and site-specific expression of CES1 and CES2 in rat intestine will help to predict the oral bioavailability of ester prodrugs.", 
    "829": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are known to cause fetal renal damage in pregnancy. Due to conflicting reports in the literature, their safety after first trimester exposure has been debated. Our aim was to determine whether the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for major malformations or other adverse outcomes. All subjects were prospectively enrolled from among women contacting a teratogen information service. At initial contact, details of maternal medical history and exposures were collected and follow-up interviews were conducted to ascertain pregnancy outcomes. Two comparator groups, women with hypertension treated with other antihypertensives, and healthy controls were also recruited. Baseline maternal characteristics were not different among the three groups. There were no differences in rates of major malformations. Both the ACE-ARBs and disease-matched groups exhibited significantly lower birth weight and gestational ages than the healthy controls (P < 0.001 for both variables). There was a significantly higher rate of miscarriage noted in the ACE/ARB group (P < 0.001). These results suggest that ACE inhibitors/ARBs are not major human teratogens; however, they may be associated with an increased risk for miscarriage.", 
    "830": "Midlife elevated blood pressure and hypertension contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and overall dementia. We sought to estimate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) reduced the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in cognitively normal individuals. In the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging, we evaluated 1,445 cognitively normal individuals treated for hypertension but without congestive heart failure from a population-based sample from eight Italian municipalities with a 3.5-year follow-up. MCI was diagnosed with current clinical criteria. Dementia, AD, and vascular dementia were diagnosed based on DSM-IIIR criteria, NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and ICD-10 codes. Among 873 hypertension-treated cognitively normal subjects, there was no significant association between continuous exposure to all ACE-Is and risk of incident MCI compared with other antihypertensive drugs [hazard ratio (HR), 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.16-1.28]. Captopril exposure alone did not significantly modify the risk of incident MCI (HR, 1.80, 95% CI, 0.39-8.37). However, the enalapril sub-group alone (HR, 0.17, 95% CI, 0.04 -0.84) or combined with the lisinopril sub-group (HR, 0.27, 95% CI, 0.08-0.96), another ACE-I structurally related to enalapril and with similar potency, were associated with a reduced risk of incident MCI. Study duration exposure to ACE-Is as a \"class\" was not associated with incident MCI in older hypertensive adults. However, within-class differences linked to different chemical structures and/or drug potencies may exist, with a possible effect of the enalapril and lisinopril sub-groups in reducing the risk of incident MCI.", 
    "831": "Reducing angiotensin II (Ang II) production via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is a key approach for the treatment of hypertension. However, these inhibitors may also affect other enzymes, such as angiotensinases and vasopressinase, responsible for the metabolism of other peptides also involved in blood pressure control, such as Ang 2-10, Ang III, Ang IV, and vasopressin. We analyzed the activity of these enzymes in the hypothalamus, plasma, and kidney of normotensive adult male rats after inhibition of ACE with captopril. Aspartyl- (AspAP), glutamyl- (GluAP), alanyl- (AlaAP) and cystinyl-aminopeptidase (CysAP) activities were measured fluorimetrically using arylamides as substrates. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), water intake, and urine flow were also measured. Captopril reduced SBP and increased urine flow. In the hypothalamus, GluAP and AspAP increased, without significant changes in either AlaAP or CysAP. In contrast with effects in plasma, GluAP was unaffected, AspAP decreased, while AlaAP and CysAP increased. In the kidney, enzymatic activities did not change in the cortex, but decreased in the medulla. These data suggest that after ACE inhibition, the metabolism of Ang I in hypothalamus may lead mainly to Ang 2-10 formation. In plasma, the results suggest an increased formation of Ang IV together with increased vasopressinase activity. In the kidney, there is a reduction of vasopressinase activity in the medulla, suggesting a functional reduction of vasopressin in this location. The present data suggest the existence of alternative pathways in addition to ACE inhibition that might be involved in reducing BP after captopril treatment.", 
    "832": "Podocytes of the kidney adhere tightly to the underlying glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in order to maintain a functional filtration barrier. The clinical importance of podocyte binding to the GBM via an integrin-laminin-actin axis has been illustrated in models with altered function of \u03b13\u03b21 integrin, integrin-linked kinase, laminin-521, and \u03b1-actinin 4. Here we expanded on the podocyte-GBM binding model by showing that the main podocyte adhesion receptor, integrin \u03b13\u03b21, interacts with the tetraspanin CD151 in situ in humans. Deletion of Cd151 in mouse glomerular epithelial cells led to reduced adhesive strength to laminin by redistributing \u03b13\u03b21 at the cell-matrix interface. Moreover, in vivo podocyte-specific deletion of Cd151 led to glomerular nephropathy. Although global Cd151-null B6 mice were not susceptible to renal disease, as has been shown previously, increasing blood and transcapillary filtration pressure induced nephropathy in these mice. Importantly, blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme in renal disease-susceptible global Cd151-null FVB mice prolonged their median life span. Together, these results establish CD151 as a crucial modifier of integrin-mediated adhesion of podocytes to the GBM and show that blood pressure is an important factor in the initiation and progression of Cd151 knockout-induced nephropathy.", 
    "833": "A series of compounds that target reactive transition-metal chelates to somatic angiotensin converting enzyme (sACE-1) have been synthesized. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) and rate constants for both inactivation and cleavage of full-length sACE-1 have been determined and evaluated in terms of metal chelate size, charge, reduction potential, coordination unsaturation, and coreactant selectivity. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), and tripeptide GGH were linked to the lysine side chain of lisinopril by 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling. The resulting amide-linked chelate-lisinopril (EDTA-lisinopril, NTA-lisinopril, DOTA-lisinopril, and GGH-lisinopril) conjugates were used to form coordination complexes with iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper, such that lisinopril could mediate localization of the reactive metal chelates to sACE-1. ACE activity was assayed by monitoring cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Mca-RPPGFSAFK(Dnp)-OH, a derivative of bradykinin, following preincubation with metal chelate-lisinopril compounds. Concentration-dependent inhibition of sACE-1 by metal chelate-lisinopril complexes revealed IC(50) values ranging from 44 to 4500 nM for Ni-NTA-lisinopril and Ni-DOTA-lisinopril, respectively, versus 1.9 nM for lisinopril. Stronger inhibition was correlated with smaller size and lower negative charge of the attached metal chelates. Time-dependent inactivation of sACE-1 by metal chelate-lisinopril complexes revealed a remarkable range of catalytic activities, with second-order rate constants as high as 150,000 M(-1) min(-1) (Cu-GGH-lisinopril), while catalyst-mediated cleavage of sACE-1 typically occurred at much lower rates, indicating that inactivation arose primarily from side chain modification. Optimal inactivation of sACE-1 was observed when the reduction potential for the metal center was poised near 1000 mV, reflecting the difficulty of protein oxidation. This class of metal chelate-lisinopril complexes possesses a range of high-affinity binding to ACE, introduces the advantage of irreversible catalytic turnover, and marks an important step toward the development of multiple-turnover drugs for selective inactivation of sACE-1.",

    "842": "Impairment of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity is implicated in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in many diseases including ischaemic stroke. The modulation of eNOS during and/or following ischaemic injury often represents a futile compensatory mechanism due to a significant decrease in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability coupled with dramatic increases in the levels of reactive oxygen species that further neutralise NO. However, applications of a number of therapeutic agents alone or in combination have been shown to augment eNOS activity under a variety of pathological conditions by potentiating the expression and/or activity of Akt/eNOS/NO pathway components. The list of these therapeutic agents include NO donors, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitors, aspirin, dipyridamole and ellagic acid. While most of these compounds exhibit anti-platelet properties and are able to up-regulate eNOS expression in endothelial cells and platelets, others suppress eNOS uncoupling and tetrahydrobiopterin (an eNOS stabiliser) oxidation. As the number of therapeutic molecules that modulate the expression and activity of eNOS increases, further detailed research is required to reveal their mode of action in preventing and/or reversing the endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "843": "Nanosuspensions have gained great interest in the last decade as a formulation tool for poorly soluble drugs. By decreasing particle sizes nanosuspensions enhance dissolution rate and bioavailability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Micro-osmotic pumps are widely used in experimental pharmacology and offer a tool of interest for the sustained release of nanosuspensions via the intraperitoneal or subcutaneous application site. The purpose of the present study was to investigate in-vitro the influence of (1) nanosuspension viscosity, (2) pump orifice position and (3) formulation osmolality on the delivery behavior of formulations in implantable osmotic systems. Therefore fenofibrate nanosuspension, methylene blue and fluorescein sodium solutions were chosen as model formulations. They were released in water or isotonic saline solution and drug/dye concentrations were determined by HPLC/UV. Release of nanosuspension particles in low viscous formulations resulted in a burst whereas increasing the viscosity led to the expected zero order delivery. Pumps with upward-positioned orifices released the nanosuspension in a zero order manner. Within the release of dyes, constant delivery could be ensured up to an osmolality of 486 mO sm/kg; above this value premature release of formulation was observed. The results indicate the requirement of in-vitro experiments prior to in-vivo animal testing for determining the release profiles of osmotic pumps.",

Next, studies were performed to determine the individual effect of inhibition of NEP and ACE on diabetes-induced vascular and neural dysfunctions. High fat fed rats (8 weeks) were treated with 30 mg/kg streptozotocin (i.p.) and after 4 additional weeks, were treated for 12 weeks with ilepatril, enalapril (ACE inhibitor) or candoxatril (NEP inhibitor) followed by analysis of vascular and neural functions. Glucose clearance was impaired in diabetic rats and was not improved with treatment although treatment with ilepatril or candoxatril partially improved insulin stimulated glucose uptake by isolated soleus muscle. Diabetes caused slowing of motor and sensory nerve conduction, thermal hypoalgesia, reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) profiles and impairment in vascular relaxation to acetylcholine and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve. Inhibition of NEP improved nerve conduction velocity and inhibition of NEP or ACE improved thermal sensitivity and protected IENF density. Ilepatril and candoxatril treatments of diabetic rats were efficacious in improving vascular responsiveness to acetylcholine in epineurial arterioles; whereas all three treatments improved vascular response to CGRP. These studies suggest that inhibition of NEP and ACE activity is an effective approach for treatment of type 2 diabetes neural and vascular complications.", 
    "849": "Renin-angiotensin system blockade slows but does not prevent the cardiovascular complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is differentially regulated in acute kidney injury, with increased cardiac ACE2 but decreased kidney ACE2 levels. This study investigated the effect of long-term ACE inhibition on cardiac and renal ACE2 in rats with CKD induced by subtotal nephrectomy (STNx). Sprague-Dawley rats had sham (control) or STNx surgery. Control rats received vehicle (n = 9) and STNx rats ramipril (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1); n = 10) or vehicle (n = 10) for 28 days. Subtotal nephrectomy resulted in impaired creatinine clearance (P < 0.05), proteinuria (P < 0.05), renal fibrosis (P < 0.05) and reduced renal cortical ACE2 mRNA (P < 0.05) and activity (P < 0.05). In rats with CKD, ramipril improved creatinine clearance (P < 0.05) and was associated with an increase in cortical but not medullary ACE2 activity (P < 0.05). Compared with control rats, STNx rats were hypertensive (P < 0.01), with increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP; P < 0.01), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH; P < 0.05) and interstitial (P < 0.05) and perivascular fibrosis (P < 0.01). In rats with CKD, ramipril decreased blood pressure (P < 0.001) and reduced LVEDP (P < 0.01), LVH (P < 0.01) and perivascular fibrosis (P < 0.05) but did not significantly reduce interstitial fibrosis. There was no change in cardiac ACE2 in rats with CKD compared with control rats. In rats with CKD, ACE inhibition had major benefits to reduce blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy and to improve creatinine clearance, but did not significantly impact on cardiac ACE2, cardiac interstitial fibrosis, renal fibrosis or proteinuria. Thus, in rats with CKD, renal ACE2 deficiency and lack of activation of cardiac ACE2 may contribute to the progression of cardiac and renal tissue injury. As long-term ACE inhibition only partly ameliorated the adverse cardio-renal effects of CKD, adjunctive therapies that lead to further increases in ACE2 activity may be needed to combat the cardio-renal complications of CKD.",

We examined outcomes from the prospective large-scale multicenter randomized HORIZONS-AMI trial to evaluate the incidence, clinical correlates, and outcomes of in-hospital sustained VT/VF after PPCI. Of 3,485 patients undergoing PPCI in whom VT/VF did not occur before or during the procedure, 181 patients (5.2%) developed VT/VF after PPCI. Most postprocedural VT/VF episodes (85%) occurred in the first 48 hours. Patients with postprocedural VT/VF were more likely men with Killip class > I on presentation but had a lower prevalence of hypertension and diabetes. Patients with postprocedural VT/VF were also less frequently taking \u03b2 blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers at admission. Mean door-to-balloon time was shorter and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction grade 0 flow before PPCI was more common in patients with VT/VF, although Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow rates after PPCI did not vary. There were no significant differences in adjusted 3-year rates of mortality (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 1.79) or composite major adverse clinical events (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stroke; hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.15) in patients with versus without postprocedural sustained VT/VF. In conclusion, sustained VT/VF after PPCI in the HORIZONS-AMI trial was not significantly associated with 3-year mortality or major adverse clinical events. Further studies are required to address the prognostic significance of VT/VF in patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI.", 
    "862": "Little is known about the vascular function and expression of endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthases (eNOS and nNOS) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Bradykinin is involved in the regulation of eNOS expression induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We characterized the vascular function and eNOS and nNOS expression in a canine model of DMD and evaluated the effects of chronic bradykinin treatment. Vascular function was examined in conscious golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs with left ventricular dysfunction (measured by echocardiography) and in isolated coronary arteries. eNOS and nNOS proteins in carotid arteries were measured by western blot and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content was analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Compared with controls, GRMD dogs had an impaired vasodilator response to acetylcholine. In isolated coronary artery, acetylcholine-elicited relaxation was nearly absent in placebo-treated GRMD dogs. This was explained by reduced nNOS and eNOS proteins and cGMP content in arterial tissues. Chronic bradykinin infusion (1 \u03bcg/min, 4 weeks) restored in vivo and in vitro vascular response to acetylcholine to the level of control dogs. This effect was NO-mediated through upregulation of eNOS and nNOS expression. In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate that DMD is associated with NO-mediated vascular endothelial dysfunction linked to an altered expression of eNOS and nNOS, which can be overcome by bradykinin.",

The G protein-coupled receptor for Ang-(1-7), mas, is expressed by mesangial cells (MC) but the signal transduction pathways activated by Ang-(1-7) in MC have not been fully elucidated. Accordingly, we studied the effect of Ang-(1-7) on extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 activation in rat MC. Ang-(1-7)-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MC is time- and concentration-dependent. Pretreatment of MC with the mas receptor antagonist A-779 but not the AT(1) antagonist losartan or the AT(2) antagonist PD123319 abrogated ERK1/2 activation. Neither pretreatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium and apocynin nor pretreatment with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor antagonists AG1478 and PD158780 attenuated Ang-(1-7)-induced activation of ERK1/2. Even though each of these compounds abolished ANG II-induced activation of ERK1/2. Ang-(1-7) increased intracellular cAMP levels and activated protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibition of either adenylyl cyclase or PKA activity attenuated Ang-(1-7)-induced ERK1/2 activation.

We found important early differences in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) due to acute hemodynamic effects, indicating that benazepril plus amlodipine was more effective in stabilizing eGFR compared to benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in non-Blacks. There was no difference in the mean eGFR loss in Blacks between therapies.

Although the risks of end-stage renal disease and microalbuminuria were lower in the ACEI/ARB group (pooled RR 0.82 [95% CI 0.64, 1.05] and 0.84 [95% CI 0.61, 1.15], respectively), the differences were not statistically significant. The ACEI/ARB benefit over placebo was significant for all outcomes except microalbuminuria. A network meta-analysis detected significant treatment effects across all outcomes for both active drugs and placebo comparisons.",

Similar results were observed with enalapril. AT1 was present on cell membrane and losartan, a competitive inhibitor of AT1, reduced TF expression to a degree similar as that exerted by ACE inhibitors. Moreover, captopril and losartan downregulated the constitutive mRNA TF expression by ~35%. Similar results were observed with anti-AT1 and angiotensin II antibodies. In addition, the constitutive VEGF antigen and mRNA levels were reduced in the presence of captopril or losartan, and an anti-VEGF antibody downregulated cell TF activity by ~40%.",

Rates of morbidity and mortality related to its complications are high and remain an important concern in terms of public health. Improvement in cardiovascular outcomes and survival is an ultimate goal of the antihypertensive treatment. However, despite the wide range of available antihypertensive drugs, the rates of BP control are still insufficient. In most hypertensive patients, more than one antihypertensive compound is necessary to achieve goal levels of blood pressure. Assuming a greater antihypertensive effect may be obtained from two or more agents given in association, many combination therapies have been proposed and tested in a number of studies. The best clinical trial evidence comes from large outcome studies with an ACE inhibitor and dihydropyridine calcium antagonist combination, that of perindopril/amlodipine in the ASCOT trial in particular.", 
    "887": "Fixed-dose combinations have been strongly endorsed by European guidelines for first-line and second-line treatment of hypertension. Among recommended combinations, that of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker stands out because the mechanisms of action of these two therapeutic classes are complementary, leading to enhanced efficacy. In the large multicentre ASCOT-BPLA trial, treatment based on the combination of amlodipine and perindopril significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death, stroke, coronary events and procedures, new-onset diabetes, and new-onset renal impairment in a wide range of patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, when compared with atenolol/thiazide-based therapy. The perindopril/amlodipine single-pill combination was developed based on guideline recommendations for combination treatment, the indications of each component, and ASCOT-BPLA trial data. Several studies in real-life settings show that a wide range of hypertensive patients, including everyday hypertensives with common risk factors, would benefit from the perindopril/amlodipine combination.", 
    "888": "Recent guidelines are consistent in acknowledging that most hypertensive patients need at least two drugs for optimal blood pressure (BP) control. Trial data are available to support the use of a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker (ie, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), plus a diuretic, a RAS blocker plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a CCB plus a diuretic. The ACCOMPLISH trial demonstrated somewhat convincingly that an ACE inhibitor/CCB is superior to the same ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide. In the ASCOT trial, amlodipine/perindopril was superior to beta-blocker/thiazide in its effects on all major cardiovascular outcomes and new-onset diabetes. Further substudies of ASCOT provided plausible explanations for the benefits of amlodipine/perindopril strategy. In the CAFE substudy, amlodipine/perindopril was significantly more effective in the reduction of central BP as compared to atenolol/bendroflumethiazide, despite similar brachial BP reduction. More recently, analysis of long-term BP variability provided a further explanation for the reduction of cardiovascular events with amlodipine/perindopril in ASCOT. Thus, the combination of perindopril and amlodipine seems an ideal logical evidence-based pair of antihypertensive agents to select.",

    "893": "Aldosterone (Aldo) is an important active hormone in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and plays a vital role in the development of hypertension, heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to explore the role of endogenous Aldo in aortic calcification in rats. We induced arterial calcification in rats by intramuscular administration of vitamin D(3) plus oral nicotine (VDN) and determined calcium content, (45)Ca(2+) accumulation and activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The mRNA level of osteopontin (OPN) was measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Deposition of collagen in the aorta wall was measured by Sirius red staining. The content of angiotensin II (Ang II) and Aldo in plasma and myocardial and vascular tissue was determined by radioimmunoassay. In rats with VDN treatment, von Kossa staining showed calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix, and the content of calcium in calcified arteries was 5.8-fold of that in control arteries (P < 0.01). The accumulation of (45)Ca(2+) and activity of ALP in calcified aortic tissue was three- and 2.5-fold, respectively, that in control tissue (P < 0.01). The mRNA expression of OPN was significantly higher, by 58%, in calcified than control tissue (P < 0.01). Vascular fibrosis was greater in rats with calcified tissue than in control rats. The level of Ang II and Aldo was 58% and 80% higher, respectively, in calcified than control tissue (both P < 0.01). The changes could be significantly improved by treatment with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and the Aldo receptor antagonist spironolactone. These results suggest that Aldo is an endogenous bioactive factor involved in vascular calcification.", 
    "894": "Metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochrome P450 (CYP) to biologically active eicosanoids has been recognized increasingly as an integral mediator in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. CYP epoxygenase-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET + DHET) and CYP \u03c9-hydroxylase-derived 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) exhibit divergent effects in the regulation of vascular tone and inflammation; thus, alterations in the functional balance between these parallel pathways in liver and kidney may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of metabolic syndrome. However, the impact of metabolic dysfunction on CYP-mediated formation of endogenous eicosanoids has not been well characterized. Therefore, we evaluated CYP epoxygenase (EET + DHET) and \u03c9-hydroxylase (20-HETE) metabolic activity in liver and kidney in apoE(-/-) and wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet, which promoted weight gain and increased plasma insulin levels significantly. Hepatic CYP epoxygenase metabolic activity was significantly suppressed, whereas renal CYP \u03c9-hydroxylase metabolic activity was induced significantly in high-fat diet-fed mice regardless of genotype, resulting in a significantly higher 20-HETE/EET + DHET formation rate ratio in both tissues. Treatment with enalapril, but not metformin or losartan, reversed the suppression of hepatic CYP epoxygenase metabolic activity and induction of renal CYP \u03c9-hydroxylase metabolic activity, thereby restoring the functional balance between the pathways. Collectively, these findings suggest that the kinin-kallikrein system and angiotensin II type 2 receptor are key regulators of hepatic and renal CYP-mediated eicosanoid metabolism in the presence of metabolic syndrome. Future studies delineating the underlying mechanisms and evaluating the therapeutic potential of modulating CYP-derived EETs and 20-HETE in metabolic diseases are warranted.",

    "896": "A literature review was conducted concerning the clinical characteristics and pathophysiology of types I and II hereditary angioedema (HAE), type III HAE, acquired C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema.", 
    "897": "The diagnosis of type I/II HAE is relatively straightforward as long as the clinician maintains a high index of suspicion. Mutations in the SERPING1 gene result in decreased secretion of functional C1INH and episodic activation of plasma kallikrein and Hageman factor (FXII) of the plasma contact system with cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen and generation of bradykinin. In contrast, there are no unequivocal criteria for making a diagnosis of type III HAE, although a minority of these patients may have a mutation in the factor XII gene. Angioedema attacks and mediator of swelling in acquired C1INH deficiency are similar to those in type I or II HAE; however, it occurs on a sporadic basis because of excessive consumption of C1INH in patients who are middle aged or older. ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema should always be considered in any patient taking an ACE inhibitor who experiences angioedema. ACE is a kininase, which when inhibited is thought to result in increased bradykinin levels. Bradykinin acts on vascular endothelial cells to enhance vascular permeability.", 
    "898": "Laryngeal swelling is not infrequently encountered in bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Novel therapies are becoming available that for the first time provide effective treatment for bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Because the characteristics and treatment of these angioedemas are quite distinct from each other and from histamine-mediated angioedema, it is crucial that the physician be able to recognize and distinguish these swelling disorders.", 
    "899": "The treatment of heart failure has seen considerable advances in the past decades. In particular, a therapeutic focus on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has provided significant improvements in outcomes. Multiple inhibition points in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, including direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, have the common feature of either blocking aldosterone production (direct renin inhibitor, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker) or the mineralocorticoid receptor. As a consequence of this inhibition, sodium and water reabsorption is blocked, and potassium (K(+)) excretion is reduced. Hyperkalemia may result from the use of multiple renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors or blockers, particularly in patients with heart failure and concomitant chronic kidney disease. Interventions to reliably control serum K(+) during renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition have not been available to date, and would be of particular value with the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists that have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. In this review, we examine the PEARL-HF study, which has tested the combined use of RLY5016, a novel nonabsorbed K(+) binding polymer, with spironolactone in heart failure patients receiving standard care but with previous documented hyperkalemia or chronic kidney disease. RLY5016 significantly lowered serum K(+) levels from baseline relative to placebo, lowered the incidence of hyperkalemia and allowed a higher proportion of heart failure patients to receive spironolactone at a dose of 50 mg/day.",

    "904": "Since angiotensin-(1-12) [Ang-(1-12)] is a non-renin dependent alternate precursor for the generation of cardiac Ang peptides in rat tissue, we investigated the metabolism of Ang-(1-12) by plasma membranes (PM) isolated from human atrial appendage tissue from nine patients undergoing cardiac surgery for primary control of atrial fibrillation (MAZE surgical procedure). PM was incubated with highly purified \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I-Ang-(1-12) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with or without renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors [lisinopril for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), SCH39370 for neprilysin (NEP), MLN-4760 for ACE2 and chymostatin for chymase; 50 \u00b5M each]. \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I-Ang peptide fractions were identified by HPLC coupled to an inline \u03b3-detector. In the absence of all RAS inhibitor, \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I-Ang-(1-12) was converted into Ang I (2\u00b12%), Ang II (69\u00b121%), Ang-(1-7) (5\u00b12%), and Ang-(1-4) (2\u00b11%). In the absence of all RAS inhibitor, only 22\u00b110% of \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I-Ang-(1-12) was unmetabolized, whereas, in the presence of the all RAS inhibitors, 98\u00b17% of \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I-Ang-(1-12) remained intact. The relative contribution of selective inhibition of ACE and chymase enzyme showed that \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I-Ang-(1-12) was primarily converted into Ang II (65\u00b118%) by chymase while its hydrolysis into Ang II by ACE was significantly lower or undetectable. The activity of individual enzyme was calculated based on the amount of Ang II formation. These results showed very high chymase-mediated Ang II formation (28\u00b13.1 fmol \u00d7 min\u207b\u00b9 \u00d7 mg\u207b\u00b9, n\u200a=\u200a9) from \u00b9\u00b2\u2075I-Ang-(1-12) and very low or undetectable Ang II formation by ACE (1.1\u00b10.2 fmol\u00d7min\u207b\u00b9 \u00d7 mg\u207b\u00b9). Paralleling these findings, these tissues showed significant content of chymase protein that by immunocytochemistry were primarily localized in atrial cardiac myocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time in human cardiac tissue a dominant role of cardiac chymase in the formation of Ang II from Ang-(1-12).", 
    "905": "Much evidence now suggests that angiotensin II has roles in normal functions of the breast that may be altered or attenuated in cancer. Both angiotensin type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptors are present particularly in the secretory epithelium. Additionally, all the elements of a tissue renin-angiotensin system, angiotensinogen, prorenin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), are also present and distributed in different cell types in a manner suggesting a close relationship with sites of angiotensin II activity. These findings are consistent with the concept that stromal elements and myoepithelium are instrumental in maintaining normal epithelial structure and function. In disease, this system becomes disrupted, particularly in invasive carcinoma. Both AT1 and AT2 receptors are present in tumours and may be up-regulated in some. Experimentally, angiotensin II, acting via the AT1 receptor, increases tumour cell proliferation and angiogenesis, both these are inhibited by blocking its production or function. Epidemiological evidence on the effect of expression levels of ACE or the distribution of ACE or AT1 receptor variants in many types of cancer gives indirect support to these concepts. It is possible that there is a case for the therapeutic use of high doses of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers in breast cancer, as there may be for AT2 receptor agonists, though this awaits full investigation. Attention is drawn to the possibility of blocking specific AT1-mediated intracellular signalling pathways, for example by AT1-directed antibodies, which exploit the possibility that the extracellular N-terminus of the AT1 receptor may have previously unsuspected signalling roles.", 
    "906": "The clinical effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disorders partially results from its anti-inflammatory action. No previous study has investigated the effect of any ACE inhibitor on lymphocyte cytokine release. In this study, we compared the effects of serum- and tissue-type angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on systemic inflammation and lymphocyte secretory function in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease. The study included 134 patients with coronary artery disease who were randomized into one of three groups and treated with enalapril (20 mg/d, n = 47), perindopril (4 mg/d, n = 45) or placebo (n = 42), respectively. The control group included 40 age-, sex- and weight-matched healthy subjects. The plasma lipid profile, glucose metabolism markers, hsCRP and lymphocyte cytokine release were examined at the beginning of the study and after 30 and 90 days of treatment. Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cells released significantly more interleukin-2, interferon-\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 than the lymphocytes of control subjects. Neither enalapril nor perindopril treatment was associated with any significant changes in blood pressure. Perindopril treatment inhibited lymphocyte cytokine release and systemic inflammation, while the effect of enalapril was insignificant. Perindopril, and, to a lesser extent, enalapril, strongly reduced lymphocyte cytokine release in insulin-resistant but not insulin-sensitive subjects. Our results indicate that perindopril is superior to enalapril in producing lymphocyte-suppressing and systemic anti-inflammatory effects in normotensive coronary artery disease patients. These effects may contribute to a reduction in the vascular risk of this group of patients, particularly in those subjects who are resistant to insulin, when these patients are treated with tissue-type angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "907": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a very prevalent cause of death in the United States. The majority of individuals who experience SCD do not survive the episode. Although there are ongoing efforts to improve resuscitation (ie, training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, easy access to automatic external defibrillators), the primary modality addressing this public health problem is prevention by identification and treatment of high-risk cohorts. Current screening techniques have focused on identifying patients for primary prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Primary prevention therapies include medications, such as beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), whose use is currently focused on only the highest-risk subpopulations. The high-risk groups that are currently screened for consideration of an ICD for either primary or secondary prevention of SCD include those with a variety of cardiomyopathies, those with a history of previous aborted SCD, and those with genetic predispositions. In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, the primary screening parameter to identify the highest-risk group (which is then subsequently screened for consideration of an ICD) is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Various other clinical factors and noninvasive test results are often combined with this information, but the optimal way in which this should be done has not been established. The array of noninvasive tests available includes those focusing on depolarization abnormalities, repolarization abnormalities, disturbed autonomic responses, and imaging. Unfortunately, current risk-stratification paradigms do not identify the majority of patients who will experience SCD. The fundamental reason for this is that the risk of SCD is truly lower in those without high-risk features such as depressed LVEF; however, the much larger number of patients with these lower-risk features translates into a larger absolute number of SCDs in this lower-risk group. In order to widen the scope of risk stratification, careful clinical study will be needed to develop appropriate testing strategies that can reliably identify patients at significant risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the broader population.",

After adjustment for clinical cardiovascular risk predictors and left ventricular ejection fraction, elevated levels of MR-proANP, MR-proADM, and CT-proET-1 were independently associated with the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure (hazard ratios per 1-SD increase in log-transformed biomarker levels of 1.97, 1.48, and 1.47, respectively; P\u22640.002 for each biomarker). These 3 biomarkers also significantly improved metrics of discrimination when added to a clinical model.

A total of 245 patients (49%) satisfied the \"Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) criteria,\" defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction of \u22640.35 and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III on registration. Among these, 162 (group A) were re-evaluated 5.4 \u00b1 2 months later with concurrent \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use. Of the 162 patients, 50 (31%) still had \"SCD-HeFT criteria\" (group A1), 109 (67%) had an improved left ventricular ejection fraction and/or New York Heart Association class (group A2), and 3 (2%) were in NYHA class IV. Of the 227 patients without baseline \"SCD-HeFT criteria\" (left ventricular ejection fraction >0.35 or NYHA class I), 125 were evaluated after 5.5 \u00b1 2 months. Of these 227 patients, 13 (10%) developed \"SCD-HeFT criteria\" (group B1), 111 (89%) remained without \"SCD-HeFT criteria\" (group B2), and 1 (1%) had worsened to NYHA class IV. The 10-year mortality/heart transplantation and sudden death/sustained ventricular arrhythmia rate was 57% and 37% in group A1, 23% and 20% in group A2 (p <0.001 for mortality/heart transplantation and p = 0.014 for sudden death/sustained ventricular arrhythmia vs group A1), 45% and 41% in group B1 (p = NS vs group A1), 16% and 14% in group B2 (p = NS vs group A2), respectively. In conclusion, two thirds of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and \"SCD-HeFT criteria\" at presentation did not maintain implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indications 3 to 9 months later with optimal medical therapy. Their long-term outcome was excellent, similar to that observed for patients who had never met the \"SCD-HeFT criteria.\"",

    "925": "Seventy-six cases were included, of which 53.9% were males. Age ranged from 2 to 74 years (median = 36 years). The main circumstances leading to poisoning were intentional (suicide attempts 92.1%; homicide attempts 5.3%), and 65.8% were admitted less than 2 hours after ingestion. Most of the patients (96.1%) showed cholinergic muscarinic manifestations, particularly salivation (86.8%), myosis (77.6%), sweating (50%), and bronchorrhea (35.5%). Atropine was used in 82.9% of patients (median = 2 days), intubation and mechanical ventilation in 46.1% (median = 3 days), and the median length of the hospital stay was 4 days. Plasma samples obtained upon admission in 59 cases revealed (LC-MS/MS): aldicarb (55), carbofuran (2), aldicarb and carbofuran (1), no active component (1). In most of the plasma and urine samples collected upon admission, the highest concentrations (ng/mL) obtained were for the active metabolite aldicarb sulphoxide (plasma, median = 831, IIQ = 99.2-2885; urine, median = 9800, IIQ = 2000-15000) than aldicarb (plasma, median = 237, IIQ = 35.7-851; urine, median = 584, IIQ = 166-1230), indicating rapid metabolism. The excretion of aldicarb and its metabolites was rapid since these compounds were rarely detected in plasma samples 48 hours after admission. Sequential cholinesterase analysis in 14 patients revealed almost complete reactivation in the first 48 hours post-admission, compatible for poisoning by carbamates. Based on the Poisoning Severity Score, the cases were classified as asymptomatic (5.3%), minor (11.8%), moderate (35.5%), severe (43.4%), and fatal (3.9%).",

    "927": "Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are markedly overlooked worldwide. The use of these kinds of preventive methods will greatly improve outcome of or even reverse major CVD, especially coronary atherosclerosis. Comprehensive lifestyle changes combined with aggressive medical therapy [lipid lowering agents \"statins\", antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors] for patients suffering from coronary heart disease significantly reduce all major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), especially in those with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), even if their coronary lesions are significant. The main mechanistic pathways for the significant reduction of MACE are: Stabilization of atheromatous plaques through endothelial function reparation, strengthening of the fibrous cap of the atheromatous plaque and reduction of atheroma burden, i.e., reversal of the process of coronary artery stenosis, the great dream of \"medical angioplasty\". Despite the compelling data indicating the great beneficial effects of both primary and secondary prevention of coronary atherosclerosis, the US national survey data reveals that only a minority of patients eligible by guidelines for these therapies in fact receive them. Hence, we strongly believe that our main duties as cardiologists is to improve the up-to-date knowledge of the practicing physicians about utility of aggressive medical therapy for both prevention and reversal of CVD, and also to promote useful primary and secondary prevention programs among physicians and patients. Meanwhile, further improvement and refinement of the current therapeutic modalities and introduction of new modalities for the management of lipid parameters other than LDL-C, such as HDL-C, triglyceride, lipoprotein (a), LDL particle size and susceptibility to oxidation may add further favourable effects in prevention and reversal of atherosclerotic process. Cardiologists should be just as aggressive with prevention as many have been with intervention. This optimistic overview is a valley cry to all practicing physicians; please depart from usual methods of intervention to preventive strategies which are largely overlooked.", 
    "928": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a highly conserved metallopeptidase. In mammals, the somatic isoform governs blood pressure whereas the germinal isoform (tACE) is required for fertility. In Ecdysozoans, ACE-like enzymes are implicated in reproduction. Despite ACE orthologues being present from bacteria to humans, their function(s) remain(s) unknown in distant organisms such as Lophotrochozoans. In silico analysis of an oyster (Crassostrea gigas) EST library suggested the presence of an ACE orthologue in molluscs. Primer walking and 5'-RACE revealed that the 1.9 kb cDNA encodes CgACE, a 632 amino acid protein displaying a conserved single active site and a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, thus resembling human tACE, as supported by molecular modelling. FRET activity assays and Maldi-TOF spectrometry indicated that CgACE is a functional dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase which is active on Angiotensin I and sensitive to ACE inhibitors and chloride ion concentration. Immunocytochemistry revealed that, as its human counterpart, recombinant CgACE is synthesised as a transmembrane enzyme. RT-qPCR, in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry shed light on a tissue, and development stage, specific expression pattern for CgACE, which is increased in the gonad during spermatogenesis. The use of ACE inhibitors in vivo indicates that the dipeptidase activity of CgACE is crucial for the oyster fertilization. Our study demonstrates that a transmembrane active ACE is present in the oyster Crassostrea gigas, and for the first time ascribes a functional role for ACE in Lophotrochozoans. Its biological function in reproduction is conserved from molluscs to humans, a finding of particular evolutionary interest especially since oysters represent the most important aquaculture resource worldwide.",

    "942": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) constitutes an important hormonal system in the physiological regulation of blood pressure. The dysregulation of the RAS is considered a major influence in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease and other pathologies. Indeed, experimental and clinical evidence indicates that blockade of this system with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists is an effective therapy to attenuate hypertension and diabetic renal injury, and to improve heart failure. Originally defined as a circulating system, multiple tissues express a complete RAS, and compelling evidence now favors an intracellular system involved in cell signaling and function. Within the kidney, intracellular expression of the three predominant ANG receptor subtypes is evident in the nuclear compartment. The ANG type 1 receptor (AT1R) is coupled to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and PKC. In contrast, both ANG type 2 (AT2R) and ANG-(1-7) (AT7R) receptors stimulate nitric oxide (NO) formation, which may involve nuclear endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Moreover, blockade of either ACE2-the enzyme that converts ANG II to ANG-(1-7)-or the AT7 receptor exacerbates the ANG II-ROS response on renal nuclei. Finally, in a model of fetal programmed hypertension, the nuclear ROS response to ANG II is enhanced, while both AT2 and AT7 stimulation of NO is attenuated, suggesting that an imbalance in the intracellular RAS may contribute to the development of programming events. We conclude that a functional intracellular or nuclear RAS may have important implications in the therapeutic approaches to cardiovascular disease.",

Standard care includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and corticosteroids, in some cases combined with immunosuppressive drugs. The antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects of ACEIs and ARBs in IgA nephropathy have been firmly established. Treatment with corticosteroids is effective in reducing proteinuria and renal injury. The addition of cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents (cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) can be of benefit in patients with a rapidly progressive disease course. Little information is available about the clinical efficacy of tonsillectomy on long-term renal survival in patiens with IgA nephropathy; at present it cannot be recommended.

    "952": "Alport syndrome inevitably leads to end-stage renal disease and there are no therapies known to improve outcome. Here we determined whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can delay time to dialysis and improve life expectancy in three generations of Alport families. Patients were categorized by renal function at the initiation of therapy and included 33 with hematuria or microalbuminuria, 115 with proteinuria, 26 with impaired renal function, and 109 untreated relatives. Patients were followed for a period whose mean duration exceeded two decades. Untreated relatives started dialysis at a median age of 22 years. Treatment of those with impaired renal function significantly delayed dialysis to a median age of 25, while treatment of those with proteinuria delayed dialysis to a median age of 40. Significantly, no patient with hematuria or microalbuminuria advanced to renal failure so far. Sibling pairs confirmed these results, showing that earlier therapy in younger patients significantly delayed dialysis by 13 years compared to later or no therapy in older siblings. Therapy significantly improved life expectancy beyond the median age of 55 years of the no-treatment cohort. Thus, Alport syndrome is treatable with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition to delay renal failure and therapy improves life expectancy in a time-dependent manner. This supports the need for early diagnosis and early nephroprotective therapy in oligosymptomatic patients.",

Glycemic control in diabetes seems likely to retard progression. Several metabolic disturbances of CKD may prove to be useful therapeutic targets but have been insufficiently tested. These include acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, and vitamin D deficiency. Drugs aimed at other potentially damaging systems and processes, including endothelin, fibrosis, oxidation, and advanced glycation end products, are at various stages of development.

    "954": "Urticaria (hives) is a common disorder that often presents with angioedema (swelling that occurs beneath the skin). It is generally classified as acute, chronic or physical. Second-generation, non-sedating H1-receptor antihistamines represent the mainstay of therapy for both acute and chronic urticaria. Angioedema can occur in the absence of urticaria, with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema and idiopathic angioedema being the more common causes. Rarer causes are hereditary angioedema (HAE) or acquired angioedema (AAE). Although the angioedema associated with these disorders is often self-limited, laryngeal involvement can lead to fatal asphyxiation in some cases. The management of HAE and AAE involves both prophylactic strategies to prevent attacks of angioedema (i.e., trigger avoidance, attenuated androgens, tranexamic acid, and plasma-derived C1 inhibitor replacement therapy) as well as pharmacological interventions for the treatment of acute attacks (i.e., C1 inhibitor replacement therapy, ecallantide and icatibant).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce cardiovascular mortality in the general population, but their benefit in maintenance hemodialysis patients is not fully explored. To test whether ACE inhibitors and ARBs differentially affect markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrinolysis during hemodialysis, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3\u00d73 crossover study. We randomly assigned 15 participants undergoing hemodialysis to placebo, ramipril (5 mg/d), and valsartan (160 mg/d) for 7 days, with a washout period of 3 weeks in between the treatments. On the morning of the seventh day of drug treatment, participants underwent serial blood sampling during hemodialysis. Neither ramipril nor valsartan affected BP during hemodialysis. Ramipril increased IL-1\u03b2 concentrations (P=0.02) and decreased IL-10 concentrations (P=0.04) compared with placebo. Valsartan and ramipril both lowered IL-6 levels during dialysis (P<0.01 for each compared with placebo). Valsartan increased F(2)-isoprostane levels, and ramipril suggested a similar trend (P=0.09). Valsartan and ramipril both lowered D-dimer levels (P<0.01 for both), whereas only ramipril seemed to prevent a rise in vWf levels (P=0.04). In summary, during hemodialysis, valsartan induces a greater anti-inflammatory effect compared with ramipril, although ramipril seems to prevent dialysis-induced endothelial dysfunction as measured by levels of vWf. A prospective clinical trial is necessary to determine whether ACE inhibitors and ARBs also differ with respect to their effects on cardiovascular mortality in this population.",

Patients were followed using daily transtelephonic ECG (tele-ECG) recordings independent of symptoms. The intention-to-treat population of the trial encompassed 425 patients (placebo group, n=211; olmesartan group, n=214). A total of 87 818 tele-ECGs were analyzed in these patients during follow-up (placebo group, 44 888 ECGs; olmesartan group, 42 930 ECGs). Thus, a mean of 207 tele-ECGs were recorded per patient. The primary end point (AF burden) was not different between the 2 groups (P=0.770). Secondary outcome parameters, including quality of life, also were not different. In particular, time to first AF recurrence, time to persistent AF, and number of hospitalizations were not different between the 2 groups. The time to prescription of recovery medication (amiodarone) was the only parameter showing an intergroup difference, with earlier prescription of amiodarone in the placebo group (P=0.022).",

The total protein content in the proximal jejunal fluids was determined in HIF and DIF, respectively. Candesartan cilexetil was significantly degraded in HIF (initial t(1/2(0-5 min))=5.4 \u00b1 0.5 min) and in DIF (initial t(1/2(0-5 min))=5.7 \u00b1 0.1 min), while chloramphenicol succinate and enalapril were stable in both media. The degradation of candesartan cilexetil was shown to be mediated by enzymes following Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics and was inhibited by addition of esterase inhibitors. The enzymatic capacity reflected by V(max) was 4-fold higher in DIF than in HIF and correlated to its 2-fold higher protein concentration. The degradation of candesartan cilexetil in the FaSSIF-pancreatin solution was slower (t(1/2)=207 \u00b1 34 min) than the degradation in both HIF and DIF. Changing the pH to the enzyme optima or increasing the amount of pancreatin, increased the degradation rate of candesartan cilexetil, but not in the magnitude as in HIF. As a result, two in vitro models, based on in vivo intestinal fluids, were developed using candesartan cilexetil as a model drug. The DIF seems to be a reasonably good model for HIF, although the degradation capacity seems to be somewhat higher, possibly due to the higher enzyme concentration in DIF. Future investigations will develop novel enzymatic based in vitro models for rapid assessment and biopharmaceutical screening tools for prodrugs.",

The rarity of the disease as well as its propensity to appear in the early 1940s, explain the low frequency of concurrent scleroderma and pregnancy. However, the marked female excess, as well as the trend for increasing maternal age due to social change and assisted reproductive technologies, renders heightened significance to issues of fertility, pregnancy course and pregnancy outcomes. In the past, scleroderma patients were thought to be at high risk for poor fetal and maternal outcome, but more current retrospective studies show that despite an increased frequency of prematurity and small for gestational age infants, overall maternal and neonatal survival is good. Hence, at present, with close monitoring and appropriate therapy most scleroderma patients can sustain a successful pregnancy. Therapy with hydroxychloroquine and low dose steroids as well as judicious use of intravenous immunoglobulins is permitted. Renal crisis remains the most dreaded complication of a scleroderma pregnancy and necessitates prompt institution of ACE inhibitor therapy despite its potential teratogenicity. In order minimize the risk for renal crisis, pregnancies should be avoided in rapidly progressive diffuse disease as such patients are at a greater risk for developing serious cardiopulmonary and renal problems early in the disease. This review shall focus on the bi-directional effects of scleroderma on fertility and pregnancy as well as on the management of pregnancy and delivery in the scleroderma patient.",

Based on combined gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF MS) data acquiring platform, we have performed a metabolomic analysis of perfused renal cortex samples from the diabetic rats induced by streptozocin and treated with or without fosinopril, a pharmacological inhibitor of angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACEI). We identified a number of abnormal metabolites in the diabetic kidney, including groups of amino acids, carbohydrates, polyols, lyso-phospholipids, glucuronides and other unidentified metabolites. Of them, an increase in intrarenal organic toxins including uremic toxins, glucuronides and glucotocixity-associated metabolites are highly correlated with diabetic kidney injury including 24h urinary protein levels and tubulointerstitial injury index. Treatment with fosinopril significantly attenuated diabetic kidney injury, and simultaneously blocked the intrarenal accumulation of these organic toxins, especially hippurate and glucuronides. These results indicate that intrarenal accumulation of organic toxins may be significant for the development of DKD and the related mechanisms deserve to be further investigated.",

International consensus recommends the use of statins as the first line of treatment for patients with this condition. However, homozygote FH patients with persistently elevated LDL-C levels are usually resistant to multiple-drug therapy. Fortunately, LDL apheresis (or simply 'lipoprotein apheresis') provides a treatment option for patients who are refractory or intolerant to lipid-lowering medications, or if there is progressive cardiovascular disease despite maximal drug therapy. Lipoprotein apheresis is an extracorporeal LDL-C-lowering treatment similar in concept to renal dialysis. There are now five main methods for extracorporeal lipoprotein apheresis in use, namely dextran sulfate adsorption (DSA), heparin extracorporeal LDL precipitation (HELP), polyacrylate full blood adsorption (PFBA or DALI\u00ae system) using hemoperfusion, immunoadsorption, and filtration plasmapheresis. Lipoprotein apheresis has been shown to be successful in reducing LDL-C levels, as well as levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a prothrombotic proatherogenic lipoprotein. In contrast, however, lipoprotein apheresis seems to have a smaller effect in preventing atherosclerosis progression, thus suggesting that a major component of the reduction in cardiovascular events may be mediated by mitigating Lp(a) levels. Side effects are infrequent and mild, and have mainly consisted of lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. As these are often bradykinin-mediated and associated with concomitant ACE inhibitor use, angiotensin type 2 receptor antagonists should be used instead of ACE inhibitors with DALI and PFBA. Nevertheless, there is scope for wider application of lipoprotein apheresis. The high cost and invasive nature of lipoprotein apheresis limits uptake; however, it is an important treatment modality that should be considered in carefully selected patients. National and international registries compiling outcome data for lipoprotein apheresis need to be established to help expand the evidence base regarding its effectiveness.", 
    "997": "Most recent meta-analyses of morbidity-mortality risk hazards brought about by the presence of diabetes as compared with non-diabetics underline the dominant risk of renal disease and cardiovascular outcomes and the relevance of blood glucose, blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol levels. The translation of this reality into therapeutic guidelines always requires interventional evidence. Evidence for combined approaches in controlling for BP and blood glucose was provided by Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: PreterAx and DiamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), conducted in over 11 000 subjects from 20 countries. Reduction in systolic BP by 7.1 mm Hg, in diastolic BP by 2.9 mm Hg and in glycated haemoglobin A1c by 0.61% points in the combined routine BP lowering and intensive blood glucose-control group after an average 4.3 years of follow-up resulted in a relative risk reduction of 28% in renal events, 24% in cardiovascular death and 18% in all-cause mortality. While other major intervention trials performed in similar populations with analogous goals did not achieve the same level of positive therapeutic evidence and even pointed to some risk of intensified treatment of type 2 diabetes, all three major studies [Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) and ADVANCE] showed significant reduction in renal events, the major risk in type 2 diabetes. The divergence for other outcomes underlines the importance of considering specific therapeutic approaches for glucose control and prudent targets for BP. The current target values for glycated haemoglobin of 6.5-7% and for BP of 130/80 mmHg appear safe and beneficial. The potential long-term benefit, particularly that of initial tight blood glucose control, suggested by recent post-trial evidence is currently being evaluated in the ADVANCE-ON study.",

Studies evaluating the DRI aliskiren versus ACEIs and ARBs on mortality and morbidity outcomes were relatively short, and few deaths or cardiovascular events occurred, resulting in insufficient evidence to discern differences. A random-effects meta-analysis of 23 RCTs comparing ACEIs and ARBs found no significant difference in the proportion of patients who achieved successful blood pressure control on a single antihypertensive agent. Compared with ARBs and the DRI aliskiren, ACEIs were consistently associated with higher rates of cough. Withdrawals due to adverse events were modestly more frequent for patients receiving ACEI rather than ARBs or DRIs; this is consistent with the differential rates of cough. There was no evidence of differential effects of ACEIs, ARBs, or DRIs on the outcomes of lipids, renal outcomes, carbohydrate metabolism or diabetes, or left ventricular mass; however, there was not a high strength of evidence for any of these outcomes. Regarding the question of whether ACEIs, ARBs, or DRIs are associated with better outcomes in specific patient subgroups, the evidence was insufficient to reach firm conclusions.", 
    "1001": "Although the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) is the most reliable screening test for primary aldo-steronism, false positives and negatives occur. Dietary salt restriction, concomitant malignant or renovascular hypertension, pregnancy and treatment with diuretics (including spironolactone), dihydropyridine calcium blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor antagonists can produce false negatives by stimulating renin. We recently reported selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors lower the ratio. Because potassium regulates aldosterone, uncorrected hypokalemia can lead to false negatives. Beta-blockers, alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suppress renin, raising the ARR with potential for false positives. False positives may occur in patients with renal dysfunction or advancing age. We recently showed that (1) females have higher ratios than males, and (2) false positive ratios can occur during the luteal menstrual phase and while taking an oral ethynylestradiol/drospirenone (but not implanted subdermal etonogestrel) contraceptive, but only if calculated using direct renin concentration and not plasma renin activity. Where feasible, diuretics should be ceased at least 6 weeks and other interfering medications at least 2 before ARR measurement, substituting noninterfering agents (e. g., verapamil slow-release\u00b1hydralazine and prazosin or doxazosin) were required. Hypokalemia should be corrected and a liberal salt diet encouraged. Collecting blood midmorning from seated patients following 2-4 h upright posture improves sensitivity. The ARR is a screening test only and should be repeated once or more before deciding whether to proceed to confirmatory suppression testing.

    "1025": "Development and introduction into practice of medicines reducing activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system the key element of which is angiotensin II (ATII) resulted in a significant improvement of efficacy of cardiovascular diseases treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and ATII receptor blockers (BRA II) effectively reduce arterial pressure, have a nephroprotective action in patients with diabetes mellitus, inhibit development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Unlike ACE inhibitors, BRA II do not exhibit the phenomenon of ATII concentration escape, they completely depress ATII interaction with AT1-receptors while AT2-receptors keep their ability to interact with this hormone. High probability of target arterial pressure achievement in the treatment with BRA II encourage higher compliance of the patients. The review of multicenter trials performed in 2007-2010 concerns a new BRA II representative--olmesartan medoxomil (OM). The trials run in two directions: hypotensive activity of OM and vaso- and other organ-protective OM properties.", 
    "1026": "Hypertension occurs twice as commonly in diabetics than in comparable nondiabetics. Patients with both disorders have a markedly higher risk for premature microvascular and macrovascular complications. Aggressive control of blood pressure (BP) reduces both micro- and macrovascular complications. In diabetic hypertensives, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are the first line in management of hypertension, and can be replaced by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) if patients are intolerant of them. Recent studies suggest ARBs to be on par with ACEI in reducing both macro- and microvascular risks. Adding both these agents may have a beneficial effect on proteinuria, but no extra macrovascular risk reduction. Thiazides can also be used as first line drugs, but are better used along with ACEI/ARBs. Beta-blockers [especially if the patient has coronary artery disease] and calcium channel blockers are used as second line add-on drugs. Multidrug regimens are commonly needed in diabetic hypertensives. Achieving the target BP of <130/80 is the priority rather than the drug combination used in order to arrest and prevent the progression of macro- and microvascular complications in diabetic hypertensives.", 
    "1027": "Hypertension affects about 10 - 25% of the population and is an important risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease. The renin-angiotensin system is frequently implicated in the pathophysiology of hypertension, be it primary or secondary. The prevalence of primary aldosteronism increases with the severity of hypertension, from 2% in patients with grade 1 hypertension to 20% among resistant hypertensives. Mineralcorticoid hypertension includes a spectrum of disorders ranging from renin-producing pathologies (renin-secreting tumors, malignant hypertension, coarctation of aorta), aldosterone-producing pathologies (primary aldosteronism - Conns syndrome, familial hyperaldosteronism 1, 2, and 3), non-aldosterone mineralocorticoid producing pathologies (apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome, Liddle syndrome, deoxycorticosterone-secreting tumors, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormones (ACTH) syndrome, congenitalvadrenal hyperplasia), and drugs with mineraocorticoid activity (locorice, carbenoxole therapy) to glucocorticoid receptor resistance syndromes. Clinical presentation includes hypertension with varying severity, hypokalemia, and alkalosis. Ratio of plasma aldosterone concentraion to plasma renin activity remains the best screening tool. Bilateral adrenal venous sampling is the best diagnostic test coupled with a CT scan. Treatment is either surgical (adrenelectomy) for unilateral adrenal disease versus medical therapy for idiopathic, ambiguous, or bilateral disease. Medical therapy focuses on blood pressure control and correction of hypokalemia using a combination of anti-hypertensives (calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers) and potassium-raising therapies (mineralcorticoid receptor antagonist or potassium sparing diuretics). Direct aldosterone synthetase antagonists represent a promising future therapy.",

Twenty-three percent (977) received antihypertensive prescription. White subjects (odds ratio [OR]: 1.61; confidence interval [CI]: 1.39-1.88), older adolescents (\u226515 years, OR: 2.11; CI: 1.79-2.48), and those with comorbidity (OR: 1.57; CI: 1.36-1.82) were more likely to receive antihypertensive prescriptions controlling for gender and years of Medicaid eligibility in logistic regression. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed monotherapy. Nearly two-thirds of adolescents received prescriptions from adult primary care physicians (PCPs) only. More than one-quarter of adolescents who received a prescription received combination therapy, which was most often prescribed by adult PCPs.", 
    "1031": "Adult PCPs were the leading prescribers of antihypertensives for adolescents with primary HTN. Race differences exist in physicians' prescribing of antihypertensives to adolescents with primary HTN. The choice of antihypertensives by physicians of different specialties warrants additional study to understand the underlying rationale for treatment decisions and to determine treatment effectiveness.",

All outpatients who were over the age of 40 years and who regularly visited a primary health care facility were invited to participate.

The prevalence of airflow limitation was 2.3% among the 89 patients with a history of statin use, which was five times lower than the prevalence of airflow limitation among patients who had not used statins (10.5%). Among the 347 patients with a history of past or current smoking, airflow limitation was not observed in the 30 patients who had used statins. However, by multivariate analysis, statin use was not significantly associated with a lower prevalence of airflow limitation.",

Moreover, the findings revealed that this supplement helped protect the \u03b2-Cells of the rats from death and damage. Interestingly, the formulation Om3/terp modulated key enzyme related to hypertension such as ACE by 37% in plasma and kidney. Moreover administration of fenugreek essential oil to surviving diabetic rats improved starch and glucose oral tolerance additively. Furthermore, the Om3/terp also decreased significantly the glucose, triglyceride (TG) and total-cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) rates in the plasma and liver of diabetic rats and increased the HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-Ch) level, which helped maintain the homeostasis of blood lipid.",

    "1040": "Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of death in dialysis patients and is usually preceded by sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. A variety of risk factors have been identified that predispose the sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients. Primary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest in dialysis patients may be accomplished by avoiding the use of low potassium dialysate. Pharmacotherapy with beta-blockers angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers and use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) may also prevent sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in high-risk dialysis patients. Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death may be accomplished by similar pharmacotherapy and by the use of ICDs. Indications for ICD use in dialysis patients are similar to those for nondialysis patients; however, survival rates following ICD implantation in dialysis patients are substantially lower than in non-dialysis patients.",

As the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, RAAS blockade has been suggested to be among the most efficient cardioprotective interventions, as revealed with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors trials. The angiotensin receptor blockers' (ARBs) efficacy in lowering blood pressure has been very well established. Telmisartan is however the first ARB to show a promising role in reducing cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients. This article will highlight the role of telmisartan in cardioprotection, underlying specifically the results of two major randomized controlled trials: ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and TRANSCEND (Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in aCE-iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease).", 
    "1042": "Proteinuria is a marker of poor prognosis in kidney transplant recipients as well as in nontransplant patients with chronic kidney disease. It negatively influences the rate of deterioration of graft renal function, graft survival, and more importantly, patient survival. This review analyzes the current knowledge on the management of this crucial aspect in kidney transplantation. The reduction of proteinuria has demonstrated a beneficial effect on kidney function and also on patient survival in nontransplant patients with chronic kidney disease, but unfortunately, to date, it has not been possible to demonstrate the same benefit in the kidney transplant population (although it probably exists). Nevertheless, the appearance of proteinuria in a renal transplant patient must always be followed by an investigation on its etiology, and many times, it should include a graft biopsy to adequately categorize the underlying process responsible for the proteinuria and to establish a correct therapy. Furthermore, in spite of the cause of proteinuria, it should be treated to reduce to normal or near-normal levels with the objective to eliminate or reduce its negative effects on the graft and the cardiovascular system of the patient. The drugs that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, are the cornerstone of the management of this complication, and recently, direct renin inhibitors have added to the armamentarium. Mono-, dual-, and triple-therapy modalities are discussed, as well as other therapies and nonpharmacologic measures.",

We conducted a post hoc analysis of the first and second Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy trials to evaluate the association of sodium intake with proteinuria and progression to ESRD among 500 CKD patients without diabetes who were treated with ramipril (5 mg/d) and monitored with serial 24-hour urinary sodium and creatinine measurements. Urinary sodium/creatinine excretion defined low (<100 mEq/g), medium (100 to <200 mEq/g), and high (\u2265200 mEq/g) sodium intake. During a follow-up of >4.25 years, 92 individuals (18.4%) developed ESRD.

Patients with high dietary sodium exhibited a blunted antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibition despite similar BP among groups. Each 100-mEq/g increase in urinary sodium/creatinine excretion associated with a 1.61-fold (95% CI, 1.15-2.24) higher risk for ESRD; adjusting for baseline proteinuria attenuated this association to 1.38-fold (95% CI, 0.95-2.00). This association was independent from BP but was lost after adjusting for changes in proteinuria. In summary, among patients with CKD but without diabetes, high dietary salt (>14 g daily) seems to blunt the antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibitor therapy and increase the risk for ESRD, independent of BP control.",

However, recent experimental and clinical findings suggest that not only L type calcium channel but also T and N type calcium cannels are possibly involved in cardiovascular diseases, through activation of sympathetic nervous system or aldosterone release. Therefore, it is proposed that L type calcium channel blockade combined with T type or N type calcium channel blockade may have additive benefits in preventing cardiovascular and renal diseases. Further future study is needed to clarify class effect and drug effect of each calcium channel blocker.",

Little is known about the early use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocking agents and their impact on renal function and hemodynamics in heart transplant recipients. In this cohort study all eligible recipients of orthotopic heart transplants at the UTAH cardiac transplantation program from 2001 through 2007 were divided into 2 groups-patients who were started on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers within the first 4 weeks of transplantation and continued on these for \u22654 weeks during the first 3 months (RAS blockade group, n = 75) and those who were not (non-RAS blockade group, n = 52). All patients were followed for 1 year after transplantation. There were no significant differences at baseline between the 2 groups. Estimated glomerular filtration rate at 12 months was significantly higher in the RAS blockade group compared to the non-RAS blockade group (mean \u00b1 SD, 56.3 \u00b1 22.4 vs 47.3 \u00b1 18.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.036).

We observed significant differences between the subgroups of patients with AF and those with sinus rhythm in terms of demographic parameters, risk factors, concomitant diseases, and therapy. Although the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers was significantly lower in the subgroup with AF, a multivariable analysis showed that it was associated with specific demographic characteristics and comorbidities rather than with arrythmia itself.

The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of enalapril on chlorhexidine digluconate-induced liver PF by decreasing transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) production in rats. PF was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by daily administration of 0.5 ml 0.1% chlorhexidine digluconate in normal saline via PD tube for one week. Rats received daily intravenous injections of low dose enalapril (1 mg/kg), or high dose enalapril (2.5 mg/kg), for one week. After 7 days, conventional 4.25% Dianeal (30 ml) was administered via a PD catheter with a dwell time of 4 h and assessment of peritoneal function. At the end of dialysis, the rats were sacrificed and liver peritoneum was harvested for microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry. There was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure and heart rate between groups. After 4 h of PD, the D\u2084/P\u2084(urea) level was reduced, the D\u2084/D\u2080 glucose level, serum and the dialysate TGF-\u03b21 level was increased, the liver peritoneum was markedly thicker, and the expression of TGF-\u03b21, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), fibronectin, collagen and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were elevated in the PF group compared with the vehicle group. High dose of enalapril decreased the serum and dialysate TGF-\u03b21 levels, decreased the thickness of the liver peritoneum, and decreased the expression of TGF-\u03b21, \u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, collagen and VEGF-positive cells in the liver peritoneum. Low dose of enalapril did not protect against chlorhexidine digluconate-induced PF in the rat. Enalapril protected against chlorhexidine digluconate-induced PF in rats by decreasing TGF-\u03b21 production.", 
    "1083": "Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and increased the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with AF. However, the pathophysiological link between hypertension and AF is unclear. Nevertheless, this can be explained by the hemodynamic changes of the left atrium secondary to long standing hypertension, resulting in elevated left atrium pressure and subsequently left atrial enlargement. Moreover, the activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation in patients with hypertension induces left atrial fibrosis and conduction block in the left atrium, resulting in the development of AF. Accordingly, recent studies have shown that effective blockage of RAAS by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonist may be effective in both primary and secondary prevention of AF in patients with hypertension, although with controversies. In addition, optimal antithrombotic therapy, blood pressure control as well as rate control for AF are key to the management of patients with AF.", 
    "1084": "We examine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients receiving various reperfusion therapies in 2 contemporary Canadian registries.", 
    "1085": "Of 4045 STEMI patients, 2024 received reperfusion therapy and had complete data on invasive management. They were stratified by reperfusion strategy used: primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (n = 716); fibrinolysis with rescue PCI (n = 177); fibrinolysis with urgent/elective PCI (n = 210); and fibrinolysis without PCI (n = 921). Data were collected on clinical and laboratory findings, and outcomes.", 
    "1086": "Compared with fibrinolytic-treated patients, patients treated with primary PCI were younger and had higher Killip class, had longer time to delivery of reperfusion therapy, and utilized more antiplatelet therapy but less heparin, \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In-hospital death occurred in 2.7% of patients treated with primary PCI, 1.7% fibrinolysis-rescue PCI, 1.0% fibrinolysis-urgent/elective PCI, and 4.8% fibrinolysis-alone (P = 0.009); the rates of death/reinfarction were 3.9%, 4.0%, 4.3%, and 7.1% (P = 0.032), respectively. The rate of shock was highest in the primary PCI group. Rates of heart failure or major bleeding were similar in the 4 groups. In multivariable analysis, no PCI during hospitalization was associated with death and reinfarction (adjusted odds ratio = 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.70; P = 0.04).", 
    "1087": "Clinical features, time to reperfusion, and medication utilization differed with respect to the reperfusion strategy. While low rates of re-infarction/death were observed, these complications occurred more frequently in those who did not undergo PCI during index hospitalization.", 
    "1088": "Much has been written about hereditary angioedema (HAE) in recent literature; however, the prevalence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEiIA) far exceeds that of HAE. Similarly, multiple therapies have been developed for HAE, yet no definitive therapy is available for ACEiIA. In this article, we discuss the mechanism, prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of ACEiIA, with focus on newer therapies recently approved for HAE and how they may be effective for ACEiIA.", 
    "1089": "The activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system caused by renal ischaemia in atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) may be responsible for serious cardiovascular and renal consequences. The aim of the study was to assess the long-term safety, tolerability and outcomes of the use of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with ARAS.", 
    "1090": "Thirty-six patients with angiographically defined ARAS (managed either with revascularization or only with medical treatment) were prospectively assessed for the safety, tolerability and outcomes of the use of ACEis or ARBs.", 
    "1091": "The mean period of follow-up was 88.9 \u00b1 37.8 months. A statistically significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was recorded over time (P < 0.001). While estimated glomerular filtration rate remained almost stable during the study period (0.816), nuclear EDTA-GFR showed a significant reduction over time (P = 0.03). Mean time from diagnosis/intervention to end-stage renal disease for the cohort of 36 patients was 165.38 \u00b1 13.62 months. Mean overall patient survival was 135.36 \u00b1 15.25 months, with fourteen deaths (38.8%) occurring during the observational period. ACEi/ARB therapy was discontinued transiently in only 4 subjects.", 
    "1092": "The use of ACEis/ARBs is safe and effective in patients with ARAS independently of any parameters.", 
    "1093": "Captopril (CPT) microparticles were manufactured by solvent evaporation using acetone (dispersion phase) and liquid paraffin (manufacturing phase) with Eudragit\u00ae and Methocel\u00ae as coat materials. Design of experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) approaches were used to optimize the process. The microparticles were characterized based on the percent of drug released and yield, microcapsule size, entrapment efficiency and Hausner ratio. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in\u00a0vitro dissolution studies were conducted. The microcapsules were spherical, free-flowing and IR and DSC thermograms revealed that CPT was stable. The percent drug released was investigated with respect to Eudragit\u00ae RS and Methocel\u00ae K100M, Methocel\u00ae K15M concentrations and homogenizing speed. The optimal conditions for microencapsulation were 1.12\u2009g Eudragit\u00ae RS, 0.67\u2009g Methocel\u00ae K100M and 0.39\u2009g Methocel\u00ae K15M at a homogenizing speed of 1643\u2009rpm and 89% CPT was released. The value of RSM-mediated microencapsulation of CPT was elucidated."
