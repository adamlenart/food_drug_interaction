Using site-directed mutagenesis and zero-trans transport assays, we investigated the role of conserved tyrosines in the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of rabbit PepT1 as predicted by hydropathy plots. All the individual TMD tyrosines were substituted with phenylalanine and shown to retain the ability to traffic to the plasma membrane of Xenopus laevis oocytes. These single substitutions of TMD tyrosines by phenylalanine residues did not affect the proton dependence of peptide uptake, with all retaining wild-type PepT1-like pH dependence. Individual mutations of four of the nine TMD residue tyrosines (Y64, Y287, Y345 and Y587) were without measurable effect on PepT1 function, whereas the other five (Y12, Y56, Y91, Y167 and Y345) were shown to result in altered transport function compared to the wild-type PepT1. Intriguingly, the affinity of Y56F-PepT1 was found to be dramatically increased (approximately 100-fold) in comparison to that of the wild-type rabbit PepT1. Y91 mutations also affected the substrate affinity of the transporter, which increased in line with the hydrophilicity of the substituted amino acid (F>Y>Q>R). Y167 was demonstrated to play a pivotal role in rabbit PepT1 function since Y167F, Y167R and Y167Q demonstrated very little transport function. These results are discussed with regard to a proposed mechanism for PepT1 substrate binding.",

Apart from the well established IgE-mediated immediate type hypersensitivity reactions, the pathogenesis of drug-induced urticaria, angioedema and anaphylaxis often remains obscure. In this article, emphasis is put on nonallergic reactions to the most commonly used drug groups of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, radiocontrast media, volume expanders and drugs used in general anesthesia. Urticaria is the second most common drug eruption after maculopapular exanthema. The mechanisms of acute urticarial reactions are multiple, mostly IgE mediated, but some drugs can induce immune complex reactions and activate complement cascade, while others can induce direct activation of mast cells and degranulation or activation of complement by non-immune mechanisms. With different types of medications different pathomechanisms are involved. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs are thought to cause reaction due to cyclooxygenase-1 inhibition and overproduction of leukotrienes, blamed for cutaneous and respiratory symptoms. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can cause fatal angioedema, which is partially explained with bradykinin excess and impairment of aminopeptidase P and dipeptidyl peptidase IV that are involved in the metabolism of substance P and bradykinin. It remains unknown what additional mechanisms are involved. Radiocontrast media and local anesthetics mostly cause nonallergic hypersensitivity reaction, but in rare cases true allergic reaction can occur. Dextran is known to cause IgG mediated, immune complex anaphylaxis and it is recommended to use human serum albumin as the safest colloid.",

Despite these therapies and device interventions heart failure remains a progressive disease with high mortality and morbidity rates. The number of patients who survive to develop advanced heart failure is increasing. These patients require new therapeutic strategies. In this review two of emerging therapies in the treatment of heart failure are discussed: metabolic modulation and cellular therapy. Metabolic modulation aims to optimize the myocardial energy utilization via shifting the substrate utilization from free fatty acids to glucose. Cellular therapy on the other hand has the goal to achieve true cardiac regeneration. We review the experimental data that support these strategies as well as the available pharmacological agents for metabolic modulation and clinical application of cellular therapy.",

The aim of this study was to compare the data on the incidence of ESRD and death in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) obtained from administrative databases with the results of a traditional, well-performed cohort study. The study was conducted in the Health District of Venice (Italy) on a cohort of 18,416 DM2 patients on hypoglycemic drug therapy enrolled from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2002 from administrative databases.Comorbid conditions were recorded from hospital discharge records, the database of death certificates was used to identify patients who died within 31 December 2004, and the database of the Dialysis and Transplantation Registry of the Veneto Region served to identify patients who started renal replacement therapy within 31 December 2004. Record linkage was performed using the unique personal identification codes (fiscal number) of Italian citizens. The cumulative incidence of ESRD was estimated using Gray's method for competing risks. The mortality rate was 50.95 per 1000 person-years, the ESRD incidence was 0.68 per 1000 person-years, with a relative risk of 2.62 with respect to all other causes of ESRD. The crude cumulative incidence of death was 22% and that of ESRD 0.33% at the end of follow-up. The results were similar to those obtained in traditional cohort studies.

    "28": "Human chymase is a highly efficient angiotensin II-generating serine peptidase expressed by mast cells. When secreted from degranulating cells, it can interact with a variety of circulating antipeptidases, but is mostly captured by alpha(2)-macroglobulin, which sequesters peptidases in a cage-like structure that precludes interactions with large protein substrates and inhibitors, like serpins. The present work shows that alpha(2)-macroglobulin-bound chymase remains accessible to small substrates, including angiotensin I, with activity in serum that is stable with prolonged incubation. We used alpha(2)-macroglobulin capture to develop a sensitive, microtiter plate-based assay for serum chymase, assisted by a novel substrate synthesized based on results of combinatorial screening of peptide substrates. The substrate has low background hydrolysis in serum and is chymase-selective, with minimal cleavage by the chymotryptic peptidases cathepsin G and chymotrypsin. The assay detects activity in chymase-spiked serum with a threshold of approximately 1 pM (30 pg/ml), and reveals native chymase activity in serum of most subjects with systemic mastocytosis. alpha(2)-Macroglobulin-bound chymase generates angiotensin II in chymase-spiked serum, and it appears in native serum as chymostatin-inhibited activity, which can exceed activity of captopril-sensitive angiotensin-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that chymase bound to alpha(2)-macroglobulin is active, that the complex is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-resistant reservoir of angiotensin II-generating activity, and that alpha(2)-macroglobulin capture may be exploited in assessing systemic release of secreted peptidases.",

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) from the bone marrow contribute to endothelial repair and neovascularization, effects that are potentially important during cardiac remodelling. We hypothesized that ACE inhibitors may exert beneficial effects during pressure-induced myocardial hypertrophy by regulating progenitor cell function.", 
    "30": "In C57/Bl6 mice, development of cardiac hypertrophy induced by transaortic constriction (TAC) for 5 weeks was reduced by ramipril, 5 mg/kg p.o., independent of blood pressure lowering. Ramipril prevented TAC-induced apoptosis of cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells. On day 1 after TAC, upregulation of Sca-1(pos)/KDR(pos) EPC was observed, which was further increased by ramipril. EPC were persistently elevated in the TAC mice receiving vehicle treatment but not in the ramipril group after 5 weeks. These effects were independent of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha mRNA and protein expression. The ACE inhibitor but not TAC improved the migratory capacity of DiLDL(pos) EPC. Increased cardiac afterload induced upregulation of extracardiac neoangiogenesis. This effect was enhanced by ACE inhibition. Ramipril but not TAC markedly increased cardiac capillary density determined by the ratio of CD31(pos) cells to cardiomyocytes. Bone marrow transplantation studies revealed that TAC increased the percentage of bone marrow-derived GFP(pos) endothelial cells in the myocardium, and ramipril made this effect more pronounced.", 
    "31": "ACE inhibition prevents pressure-induced maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy and increases intra- and extracardiac neoangiogenesis associated with the upregulation of EPC and amelioration of EPC migration.

Increasing frailty and progression of heart failure in large numbers of patients means clinicians are increasingly challenged to provide end-of-life care for heart failure patients. End-of-life care has been little studied, but management can be understood from early clinical trials of advanced heart failure. Evidence-based heart failure medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers, improve symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure and depressed ejection fraction and should usually be continued in end-stage disease. Patients also should have ongoing meticulous management of fluid status to maximize quality of life. End-of-life care should be planned with the patient and family and should incorporate comprehensive symptom management, bereavement support, and spiritual support. Ongoing communication with patients and families about prognosis can ease the planning of care when the end of life nears.",

Only two prospective, randomized trials have compared outcomes after CRT in NYHA class III and IV patients. CRT improved mortality, exercise capacity, and quality of life in class IV patients, but the 1-year mortality remained high. Patients in these trials were in sinus rhythm at randomization and most patients had a left bundle branch block. Less data are available for NYHA class IV patients with atrial fibrillation, right bundle branch block, and previous ventricular pacing. No prospective randomized data are available for the use of CRT as rescue therapy in inotrope-dependent patients, but several case series have reported promising results. It is likely that \"rescue therapy\" with CRT will be most beneficial when patients improve enough with CRT to allow reinstitution of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers.", 
    "34": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with frequent hospitalizations and high mortality. It affects more than 5 million individuals in the USA, and another 660,000 new cases are diagnosed each year; overall, heart failure (HF) now accounts for 7% of all deaths from cardiovascular disease. Hypertension (HTN) increases the risk of development of HF and it precedes it in 75% of cases. HF patients are nearly evenly divided between those with reduced left ventricular (LV) function or systolic dysfunction and those with preserved LV systolic function or diastolic dysfunction. The management of HTN in patients with CHF is challenging. Drugs such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor blockers, hydralazine and nitrates, which have shown mortality benefit in CHF and exert antihypertensive effects, should be used as first-line agents to control HTN in CHF. In addition, antihypertensive drugs such as alpha-receptor blockers that can increase mortality in HF should be avoided. The dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers are good antihypertensive medications with a neutral effect on mortality in patients with CHF. These may be used in CHF patients with refractory HTN. In patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, HTN is treated differently in comparison to patients with HF with normal ejection fraction. This article reviews the treatment of essential HTN in patients at risk for developing HF, in the presence of HF and the latest developments in treatment that might benefit both HTN and HF management.", 
    "35": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (Coversyl) is a long-acting lipophilic drug with a high-tissue affinity for the ACE. ACE inhibition by perindopril has two main effects: it inhibits the angiotensin II formation and potentiates bradykinin. Perindopril is one of the ACE inhibitors that has been extensively studied in randomized clinical trials within various patient populations. The clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Perindopril has a positive safety and tolerability profile. Therefore, perindopril, as an ACE inhibitor, has an established place in the major clinical treatment guidelines. This article discusses several studies that have shown that an antihypertensive treatment with perindopril reduces and prevents cardiovascular events in a large range of patients with established vascular disease. The observed cardioprotective benefits of perindopril were independent of blood pressure. The outcome of these and other trials support the concept of specific cardioprotective properties of ACE inhibition by perindopril in addition to the blood pressure-lowering effects, such as anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties. In addition, the observed consistency of the treatment benefit across subgroups indicates that the absolute benefits conferred by treatment are mainly established by each patient's future risk of vascular complications, rather than their initial blood pressure level or other risk factors. This article describes these issues according to the main studies with perindopril or perindopril-based regimens, concluding that the blood pressure-dependent and -independent cardioprotective effects extend to all patients with vascular disease. This concept supports the provision of ACE inhibitor-based treatment, not on the basis of arbitrary cut-off points for blood pressure but rather on assessment of vascular risk, which is raised in patients with stable CAD, diabetes and stroke.",

In this retrospective historical study, we investigated whether ACE inhibition (ACEI) associated or not with the use of MMF has the same effect in humans as in experimental studies and what factors are associated with a clinical response. A total of 160 transplant patients with biopsy-proven CAN were enrolled. Eighty-one of them were on ACE therapy (G1) and 80 on ACEI_free therapy (G2). Patients were further stratified for the use of MMF. G1 patients showed a marked decrease in proteinuria and stabilized serum creatinine with time. Five-year graft survival after CAN diagnosis was more frequent in G1 (86.9 vs 67.7%; P < 0.05). In patients on ACEI-free therapy, the use of MMF was associated with better graft survival. The use of ACEI therapy protected 79% of the patients against graft loss (OR = 0.079, 95%CI = 0.015-0.426; P = 0.003). ACEI and MMF or the use of MMF alone after CAN diagnosis conferred protection against graft loss. This finding is well correlated with experimental studies in which ACEI and MMF interrupt the progression of chronic allograft dysfunction and injury. The use of ACEI alone or in combination with MMF significantly reduced proteinuria and stabilized serum creatinine, consequently improving renal allograft survival.",

Introduction of a selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist followed by a direct renin inhibitor provided excellent blood pressure control and complete abrogation of heavy proteinuria. This was associated with a decrease in kidney function, with serum creatinine level increasing by approximately 30%. This increase is considered acceptable after the introduction of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, is regarded as an indicator of drug efficacy, and confers longer term renal protection.

This article presents the first known case of effective pharmacological treatment of heart failure due to metastases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Due to pressure caused by metastatic tissue on the left atrium and the decreased blood inflow to the left ventricle, the 61-year-old male patient suffered from dyspnea. Treatment with sunitinib, an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was initiated and led to a decrease in the mass of the metastasis infiltrating the left atrium. Arterial hypertension caused by sunitinib therapy was effectively controlled by the use of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. Therapy with sunitinib reduced the symptoms of exercise intolerance; the patient felt much better and was able to return to his family and resume professional activity. Further studies are required to confirm the utility of sunitinib therapy in patients with symptoms of heart failure due to heart metastases from RCC.", 
    "51": "Anemia has been recognized as a very common and serious comorbidity in heart failure, with a prevalence ranging from 10 to 79%, depending on diagnostic definition, disease severity and patient characteristics. A clear association of anemia with worse prognosis has been confirmed in multiple heart failure trials. This finding has recently triggered intense scrutiny in order to identify the underlying pathophysiology and the best treatment options. Etiology is multifactorial, with iron deficiency and cytokine activation (anemia of chronic disease) playing the most important roles. Treatment is aimed at not only restoring hemoglobin values back to normal, but also at improving the patient's symptoms, functional capacity and hopefully the outcome. Iron supplementation and erythropoietin-stimulating agents have been used for this purpose, either alone or in combination. In this review, the recent advances in elucidating the mechanisms leading to anemia in the setting of heart failure are presented and the evidence supporting the use of different treatment approaches are discussed.", 
    "52": "Arterial hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk factor. The benefit drawn from decreasing and normalizing the blood pressure level is indisputable. The ACCOMPLISH study performed in patients older than 65 with systolic hypertension and a high cardiovascular risk pointed out the interest of well choosing the antihypertensive combination to reduce this risk beyond the decrease of blood pressure. The association of benazepril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or ACEI) and amlodipine (a calcium antagonist) has shown significant early cardiovascular protection in such patients as compared to the classic association including the same ACEI and hydrochlorothiazide, in spite of the same target blood pressure reached. This important finding does not contest the interest of a well controlled blood pressure in hypertension, but probably will modify our first antihypertensive combination choice in the future in patients with such cardiovascular profile.", 
    "53": "In sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a severe prognostically relevant cardiac autonomic dysfunction exists, as manifested by a strong attenuation of sympathetically and vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV). The mechanisms underlying this attenuation are not limited to the nervous system. They also include alterations of the cardiac pacemaker cells on a cellular level. As shown in human atrial cardiomyocytes, endotoxin interacts with cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels, which mediate the pacemaker current If and play an important role in transmitting sympathetic and vagal signals on heart rate and HRV. Moreover, endotoxin sensitizes cardiac HCN channels to sympathetic signals. These findings identify endotoxin as a pertinent modulator of the autonomic nervous regulation of heart function. In MODS, the vagal pathway of the autonomic nervous system is particularly compromised, leading to an attenuation of the cholinergic antiinflammatory reflex. An amelioration of the blunted vagal activity appears to be a promising novel therapeutic target to achieve a suppression of the inflammatory state and thereby an improvement of prognosis in MODS patients. Preliminary data revealed therapeutic benefits (increased survival rates and improvements of the depressed vagal activity) of the administration of statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with MODS.",

To be eligible, patients also had to have underlying cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or left atrial enlargement. Patients were randomly assigned to receive valsartan or placebo.

    "68": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition that is increasing in prevalence in developed nations. The economic and psychosocial costs of CKD are considerable, and are associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Specific treatments do not exist for many causes of CKD. Therefore, treatment is reliant on the introduction of therapies that retard progression of structural renal damage and renal impairment. At present, aside from judicious use of antihypertensive agents to lower blood pressure, and possibly low-protein diets and statin therapy, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are the only widely available treatments. Although these measures attenuate the inexorable progression to renal failure, they do not halt it. One limiting factor may be feedback effects of ACEis and ARBs, such as increased plasma renin activity. Aliskiren is a newer agent that inhibits renin, the rate-limiting step in the RAAS. There are several theoretical reasons to suggest that aliskiren may have renoprotective actions superior to those of ACEis and ARBs. In this paper the available evidence regarding renoprotective effects of aliskiren is reviewed, with an emphasis on comparison with ACEis and ARBs.",

Upstream therapies such as calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), or statins have attracted attention for treating AF patients. We have previously reported that ACEI inhibited the progression of PAF to CAF. CCB and statins were also reported to inhibit the development of AF, but the follow-up periods in several of the papers appeared to be too short to allow a clear verdict on the antiarrhythmic effects. We therefore conducted a retrospective analysis of the relationship between long-term treatment (over 5 years) with an ACEI, CCB, or statin and outcome in patients with PAF (n = 125).The follow-up period was 7.7 +/- 3.1 years. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs were prescribed for 76.6% of the patients, ACEI for 36.0%, CCB for 47.2%, and statins for 20.0%. We assessed the cardiac rhythm from the medical records or electrocardiograms and determined the time from the first visit to the development of CAF. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the use of an ACEI significantly decreased the cumulative probability of CAF, while class I antiarrhythmics, CCB, and statins did not inhibit progression to CAF. Multivariate analysis showed that only ACEI was related to a reduced progression to CAF (odds ratio, 0.112; 95% confidence interval, 0.034 to 0.374, P = 0.001). Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, CCBs, and statins showed no such association.ACEI thus appear to be superior to CCB or statins with respect to upstream therapy.",

On stepwise multivariable analyses, a higher plasma adiponectin concentration before treatment (rs=-0.561, P<0.0001) was a significant independent predictor of a greater decrease in adiponectin concentration and the decrease in plasma adiponectin concentration was significantly correlated with the improvement of LVEF (r=-0.561, P<0.0001).",

    "83": "Elevated levels of circulating prorenin, the precursor of renin, have been reported to precede the appearance of microvascular complications in diabetes mellitus. Although several studies using animal models have attempted to address the link between elevated prorenin and the tissue remodeling and damage associated with both hypertension and diabetes mellitus, the results have been contradictory, and the mechanism whereby prorenin might contribute to these pathologies remains a subject of debate. To directly test the role of prorenin in these pathologies, we generated transgenic mice with selective increases (13- to 66-fold) in circulating native or active site-mutated prorenin. Systolic blood pressure was either unchanged or increased (+25 mm Hg) in native prorenin-expressing mice, whereas the mice expressing active site-mutated prorenin showed no significant differences in systolic blood pressure compared with control animals. There was no increase in cardiac fibrosis or renal glomerular sclerosis in any of the transgenic animals tested, even at an advanced age (18 months). Captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) rapidly normalized blood pressure of hyperproreninemic mice, whereas infusion of the putative antagonist of the prorenin receptor (handle region peptide) had no effect. These results suggest that the primary consequence of chronic elevations in circulating prorenin is an increase in blood pressure and do not support a role for prorenin as the primary causative agent in cardiac fibrosis or renal glomerular injury. The lack of effect seen with active site-mutated prorenin and the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition are also consistent with prorenin acting through the generation of angiotensin II to raise blood pressure.", 
    "84": "Blood pressure is an important determinant of the risk of macro- and microvascular vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Current European guidelines for the management of hypertension recommend lowering blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial (n = 11,140), is the first trial designed to address the issue of whether routine blood pressure lowering with the fixed combination of perindopril/indapamide is beneficial in patients with diabetes with a broad range of baseline blood pressure values. In addition, it aimed to determine if clinical benefit is achieved over and above that observed with background angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. In the perindopril/indapamide arm, the reduction in blood pressure led to significant clinical benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes, irrespective of baseline blood pressure values, and subsequently improved mortality rates, and macro- and microvascular outcomes, beyond the improvements associated with patients' existing antihypertensive therapies. ADVANCE is a robust well-designed trial, the results of which are directly applicable to current clinical practice. The ADVANCE study defines the relevant blood pressure goals for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk of cardiovascular events and underscores the benefits of aggressive blood pressure reduction even in normotensive patients with diabetes. It is likely that these findings will have a significant impact on the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. In view of the evidence indicating that clinical benefits obtained with the perindopril/indapamide combination can be expected even in patients who are normotensive, vascular risk rather than initial blood pressure should be employed to determine appropriate treatment protocols in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

In the HOT study, the addition of aspirin to patients with diabetes and controlled hypertension decreased the risk of myocardial infarction. Blood pressure control with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in MICRO-HOPE also showed significant reductions in the risk of vascular complications, and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system produced substantial renal protective effects in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Statin therapy in the HPS and CARDS studies was effective in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disorders. Finally, an intensive multifactorial intervention achieved sustained reduction in the risk of vascular complications and death in patients with type 2 diabetes in the Steno-2 study.

    "90": "Cardioembolic stroke accounts for one third of all ischemic strokes, and atrial fibrillation (AF) is the cardiac source of emboli in 50% of them. However, the absolute risk of stroke associated with AF has enormous variability, and several clinical risk stratification schemes have been proposed. One of the most validated and used in clinical practice is the CHADS2 index, characterized by its simplicity and rapid application. Current recommendations about antithrombotic therapy in AF patients are based on assessment of annual risk of stroke; thus, antiaggregation is indicated in patients with a low risk, and anticoagulation is prescribed when annual risk is greater than 2.5%. Relevant studies comparing rate and rhythm control do not defend achievement and maintenance of sinus rhythm as a routine management of AF patients and demonstrate that rate control is comparable or even better than rhythm control in terms of survival and quality of life. Optimal control of blood pressure is a relevant factor in preventing cardioembolic stroke in AF patients, because hypertension multiplies the risk of stroke by 12. Antihypertensive drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers proved to reduce AF recurrences, especially in the context of left ventricular dysfunction and ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "91": "The effect of pH grade of silicates on chemical stability of amorphous drugs coground with silicates (Neusilin and Aerosil) was investigated using quinapril HCl (QHCl) as a model drug. The ability of pH-modifiers (ascorbic acid and MgO) to improve chemical stability was explored. PXRD and polarized light microscopy indicated complete amorphization of all samples by cryo-grinding. All samples remained amorphous during stability study at 40 degrees C and 48% RH. In general, drug degradation was greater in the QHCl/silicate (1:3) coground amorphous samples than the neat amorphous QHCl. The rate of diketopiperazine formation by cyclization of QHCl was higher in the presence of lower pH grades than higher pH grades of silicates. However, the pH-stability profile of coground amorphous systems prepared with different pH grades of silicates was not consistent with the pH-stability profile of the drug in solution. A basic pH-modifier (MgO) in a lower pH grade silicate (Neusilin US2) stabilized coground amorphous QHCl. Also, an acidic pH-modifier (ascorbic acid) in a higher pH grade silicate (Neusilin FL2) suppressed QHCl hydrolysis. The pH grade of silicates is a major factor affecting the chemical stability of a coground amorphous drug and pH-modifiers are useful for chemical stabilization without compromising physical stability.",

A subset from both dietary groups was given low dose ACEI in drinking water (perindopril, 0.3 mg/kg/day) throughout the study. The high fat diet increased body weight, adiposity, circulating leptin and insulin and in the liver we observed fat accumulation and increased tissue ACE activity. Treatment with perindopril decreased food intake and circulating insulin in both diet groups, and hepatic ACE activity in high fat fed animals only. Decreased plasma leptin concentration with ACE inhibition was only evident in chow fed animals. These effects were independent of any blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibition.",

We reviewed consecutive patients with ADHF admitted from 2003 to 2006 with a cardiac index < or =2.2 L/min/m(2) admitted for intensive medical therapy. Patients discharged with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (control group) were compared with those receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers plus I/H (I/H group). The control (n = 97) and I/H (n = 142) groups had similar demographic characteristics, baseline blood pressure, and renal function. Patients in the I/H group had a significantly higher estimated systemic vascular resistance (1,660 vs 1,452 dynes/cm(5), p <0.001) and a lower cardiac index (1.7 vs 1.9 L/min/m(2), p <0.001) on admission. The I/H group achieved a similar decrease in intracardiac filling pressures and discharge blood pressures as controls, but had greater improvement in cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance. Use of I/H was associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality (34% vs 41%, odds ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.99, p = 0.04) and all-cause mortality/heart failure rehospitalization (70% vs 85%, odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.97, p = 0.03), irrespective of race. In conclusion, the addition of I/H to neurohormonal blockade is associated with a more favorable hemodynamic profile and long-term clinical outcomes in patients discharged with low-output ADHF regardless of race.",

LPS administration significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 22.7 +/- 5.4 mmHg after intravenous LPS injection in icv losartan-treated rats, while SBP remained unchanged in vehicle-treated or sc captopril-treated rats by intravenous LPS. These results indicate that central AT(1) receptors, not responsive to peripheral ANG II, play an important role in systemic AVP secretion and maintenance of blood pressure during endotoxemia.",

    "113": "Heart failure is associated with impairment in nitric oxide (NO) mediated vasodilatation, which has been demonstrated to result from a reduction in the relative expression of the leucine zipper positive (LZ+) isoform of the myosin targeting subunit (MYPT1) of myosin light chain phosphatase. Further, captopril preserves normal LZ+ MYPT1 expression, the sensitivity to cGMP-mediated vasodilatation and modulates the expression of genes in the p42/44 MAPK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades. This study tests whether angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB) with losartan decreases p42/44 MAPK or p38 MAPK signaling and preserves LZ+ MYPT1 expression in a rat infarct model of heart failure. In aortic smooth muscle, p42/44 MAPK activation increases and LZ+ MYPT1 expression falls after LAD ligation. Losartan treatment decreases the activation of p42/44 MAPK to the uninfarcted control level and preserves normal LZ+ MYPT1 expression. The expression and activation of p38 MAPK, however, is low and does not change following LAD ligation or with losartan therapy. These data suggest that either reducing or blocking the effects of circulating angiotensin II, both decreases the activation of the p42/44 MAPK signaling cascade and preserves LZ+ MYPT1 expression. Thus, the ability of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs to modulate the vascular phenotype, to preserve normal flow mediated vasodilatation may explain the beneficial effects of these drugs compared to other forms of afterload reduction in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "114": "The antihypertensive effects of telmisartan 80 mg versus valsartan 160 mg, both combined with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg, were assessed in a pooled analysis from two large trials with identical study designs in patients with stage 1-2 hypertension. The trials were double-blind with a 4:4:1 randomization scheme to compare once-daily telmisartan 80 mg and HCTZ 25 mg versus once-daily valsartan 160 mg and HCTZ 25 mg versus once-daily placebo on reductions in clinic blood pressure (BP). The primary end point was changes from baseline in BP at the end of 8 weeks. In total, 2121 patients were randomized (telmisartan-HCTZ, 942, valsartan-HCTZ, 952, and placebo, 227) and had baseline seated BPs of 154/102 and 155/102 mm Hg in the two studies, respectively. Changes from baseline in BP after administration of telmisartan-HCTZ (-24.5/-18.0 mm Hg) were significantly greater than for both placebo (-4.1/-6.5 mm Hg) and valsartan-HCTZ (-22.3/-16.8 mm Hg) (versus placebo, P<0.0001 for systolic and diastolic BP; versus valsartan-HCTZ, P=0.0004 for systolic BP and P=0.0019 for diastolic BP). Adverse event rates were higher in the placebo group than in the active treatment groups (placebo, 41%, telmisartan-HCTZ, 30%, and valsartan-HCTZ, 30%, P<0.05). These data confirm that telmisartan-HCTZ at doses of 80/25 mg lowered systolic and diastolic BP to a greater extent than valsartan-HCTZ at doses of 160/25 mg in stage 1-2 hypertension. The magnitude of the BP-lowering effect provides support for the use of angiotensin receptor blockers with higher doses of a thiazide diuretic (25 mg) to improve hypertension control.", 
    "115": "Lupus erythematosus is a chronic and inflammatory multiorgan disease with variable clinical appearance and variable course. Most patients with systemic lupus erythematosus show cutaneous manifestations and conversely, all forms of cutaneous LE may change into a systemic involvement. Specific lesions of cutaneous LE are classified in different subtypes of acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ACLE), subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CDLE) and intermittent cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ICLE) according to clinical, histological and immunoserological parameters. Regular laboratory tests are important to monitor the activity and course of the disease or side effects of the therapy. In case of clinical or laboratory dysfunctions of internal organs, additional technical investigations are necessary. Histology is needed to support clinical diagnosis. A large number of drugs are able to induce SCLE, e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, terbinafine, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Drug-induced SCLE can be differentiated by possible complementary immunoserological parameters. Neonatal lupus can be induced by transplacental transmission of maternal anti-Ro(SS-A) and anti-La(SS-B)-antibodies. Children with neonatal lupus might suffer from congenital atrioventricular block. Their mothers may suffer from active LE, but can be clinically healthy as well. As a consequence, pregnancies at risk should be monitored in short intervals by serial echocardiographic interventions. Protection against UV light is recommended for all types of CLE. There are some topical and many systemic treatment options e.g. topical and systemic glucocorticosteroids, antimalarial drugs, dapsone, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil with different response to skin or organ involvement.",

We postulate that ACE inhibitors prevent coronary diseases via direct MMP-9 inhibition and could interact with the MMP-9 active sites using specific modes similar to those used for the ACE active sites. Research of the molecular interaction between MMP-9 active sites and ACE inhibitors appears to be an important key in the development of effective MMP-9 inhibitors for cardiovascular protection.",

Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials, epidemiologic studies, and registries guide our clinical practice. They are good but not perfect. Why is this the case? One of the answers is that they provide mean values for outcomes, and mean values do not explain the clinical outcomes of the outliers. A good illustrative example is survival after myocardial infarction. The data that are provided are usually average data, but these data may not reflect the same outcome in patients with little myocardial ischemia and good ventricular function compared to those with poor ventricular function and a large amount of myocardium in jeopardy due to myocardial ischemia.",

This observation revealed a possible transporter-mediated drug-drug interaction (DDI) between gemcabene and quinapril. This led to a series of studies investigating the underlying clearance mechanisms associated with these compounds intended to elucidate renal transporter interactions between quinapril and gemcabene. In vitro transporter studies using human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with human or rat organic anion transporter 3 (hOAT3, rOat3) revealed that quinaprilat is a substrate in both species, with a K(m) value of 13.4 microM for hOAT3. Subsequent studies discovered that gemcabene inhibited quinaprilat uptake by hOAT3 and rOat3 at IC(50) values of 35 and 48 microM, respectively. Moreover, gemcabene acylglucuronide, the major metabolite of gemcabene glucuronidation, also inhibited hOAT3- and rOat3-mediated uptake of quinaprilat at IC(50) values of 197 and 133 microM, respectively. High plasma concentrations of gemcabene (>100 microM) achieved in humans and rats upon oral dosing corroborate with gemcabene inhibition of renal OAT3-mediated secretion of quinaprilat in vitro. This investigation established that a DDI between gemcabene and quinapril involving inhibition of renal transporters and subsequent elevation in plasma concentrations of quinaprilat is responsible for the apparent synergistic blood pressure reduction observed with these compounds.", 
    "154": "Combination of drugs from different classes of antihypertensives provides an additional antihypertensive effect thus minimising the probability of adverse effects related to the dose of antihypertensive. Combination therapy is indicated for the following groups of hypertensive patients: (a) all hypertensive patients whose systolic blood pressure exceeds the target systolic blood pressure value by > 20 mm Hg, or whose diastolic blood pressure exceeds the target diastolic blood pressure value by > 10 mm Hg; (b) in patients with diabetes mellitus (because the target values are < 130/80 mm Hg); (c) patients with target organ damage; (d) patients with a kidney or cardiovascular disease (patients with IHD, patients after a cerebrovascular accident); (e) patients with overall cardiovascular risk according the SCORE > or = 5%. The advantage of fixed combinations resides in the fact that they increase compliance with treatment by reducing the number of pills taken by the patients. A fixed combination of the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the calcium channel blocker amlodipine proves optimal as has been shown by the results of the ASCOT-BPLA study. The launch of the above combination on this market should therefore be welcome. The fixed combination of perindopril and amlodipine will be indicated for hypertensive patients with uncontrolled hypertension or cardiovascular risk factors. This fixed combination will also be ideal for patients with a higher risk of diabetes mellitus, i.e. patients with a higher fasting glycaemia, in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and in patients with the metabolic syndrome. We strongly believe that it will improve the control of hypertension in our hypertensive patients, and improve the cardioprotective and nephroprotective effect of hypertension therapy.",

Recently, a widespread use of AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) has contributed more attractive information on the involvement of Ang-II in cancer. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that the renin -angiotensin system is implicated in the development of various cancers. From basic and clinical data, we believe that ARB has a novel ability to decelerate prostate specific antigen elevation especially in hormone refractory cancer and suppress the incidence of prostate cancer, which implies that ARB may have a chemopreventive activity for prostate cancer.",

The combined treatment of ACE-I with other clinically used agents, such as interferon, imatinib mesylate, and vitamin K shows more potent inhibitory effects on the development of liver fibrosis and HCC. Since RAAS inhibitors are widely used in the clinical practice without serious side effects, they may represent a potential new therapeutic strategy against the progression of chronic liver diseases.",

Except for the antihypertensive effects, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are proved to be very effective in primary and secondary event onset prophylaxis by many clinical trials. The angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) used briskly in recent years inhibits angiotensin II type 1 receptor alternatively.

It is also recommended in patients with heart failure who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment with an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker. Treatment with an ARB improves ventricular function and patient well-being, and reduces hospital admission for worsening heart failure. In patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, although no treatment has yet been shown, convincingly, to reduce morbidity and mortality, adequate treatment of hypertension is important and ARB is considered to be able t o reduce the risk of admissionsfor heart failure.", 
    "160": "The endothelium modulates vascular tone, blood coagulation, cell growth, and inflammation throughout the circulatory system. Endothelial dysfunction has been proposed to be one of the initiating events of atherosclerosis and is characterized by unbalanced concentrations of vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors, the most important being nitric oxide (NO) and angiotensin II (AII), respectively. In endothelial cells, AII, the key effector of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and negatively regulates the NO signaling pathway and thereby induces endothelial dysfunction. RAS blockade with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers(ARBs) provides a rational approach to reverse endothelial dysfunction. In this review, attention has been specifically focused on recent findings and putative mechanisms of the beneficial effects of RAS blockade on endothelial function.",

Here, we report the design, analysis protocol, reproducibility and relevant quality control procedures, and baseline patient characteristics of the ONTARGET/TRANSCEND cardiac MRI substudy. MRI was undertaken in 330 subjects enrolled in ONTARGET, and 38 subjects in TRANSCEND, across eight centers in six countries. Analyses were performed by two independent analysts using guide-point modeling. Cases with discrepancies in LV mass (LVM) of >5% were independently reanalyzed.

    "164": "Much focus has been placed on the role of the renin-angiotensin system as a mediator of the progression of chronic kidney disease. Novel therapeutic strategies to inhibit the negative impact of renin-angiotensin activation, including dual therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin-receptor blocker, have been suggested to achieve more complete disruption of the renin-angiotensin system. The role played by aldosterone, a target of angiotensin II, in the progression of chronic kidney disease has become a subject of significant interest over the past decade. Experimental studies in animals have shown that persistently elevated aldosterone levels lead to pathohistological changes in the kidney, along with renal and cardiac fibrosis. Incomplete suppression of aldosterone may, therefore, contribute to the deleterious effects of the renin-angiotensin system in the setting of chronic kidney disease. Clinical trials in adults have shown a potential role for mineralocorticoid receptor blockers to delay further the development of end-stage renal disease by completing renin-angiotensin blockade. In adults, mineralocorticoid receptor blockade produces a significant anti-proteinuric effect and has minimal risk of causing hyperkalemia if the condition of the patients is closely monitored. Further studies will need to be conducted to determine whether mineralocorticoid receptor blockers are equally effective and safe for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in children.",

This study investigated whether peroxynitrite is actually generated in the vascular wall with angiotensin II-induced NADPH-oxidase activation, thus contributing to the dysfunction. In isolated mesenteric arteries of male 18-week-old SHR-cp, relaxations in response to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were impaired compared with that in Wistar-Kyoto rats. This impaired relaxation was not restored by treatment with apocynin, an NADPH-oxidase inhibitor. Protein expression of endothelial NO synthase increased while that of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) decreased in the artery. We observed increased production of superoxide anions and peroxynitrite from the artery and their inhibition by apocynin, and also increased contents of nitrotyrosine, a biomarker of peroxynitrite, in mesenteric arteries and angiotensin II in aortas. Long-term (8 weeks) administration of telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonist, prevented the impaired vasorelaxation, decreased sGC expression and increased nitrotyrosine content in mesenteric arteries. These findings suggest that in the vascular wall of SHR-cp, peroxynitrite is continually produced by the reaction of NO with NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide via angiotensin II and gradually denatures sGC protein, leading to vasorelaxation dysfunction.",

    "179": "Heart failure with a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) is a common clinical problem with many unsolved questions regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy. Although the term diastolic heart failure has been abandoned, diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction together with combined systolic ventricular and arterial stiffening are considered to be the main pathophysiologic mechanisms in HFNEF. Current guidelines define HFNEF by symptoms or signs of heart failure in the presence of LV ejection fraction of more than 50%, but with additional evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction. Definite diagnosis of HFNEF requires exclusion of valvular heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, and several noncardiac diseases. Echocardiographic assessment of the tissue Doppler-derived filling index E/E', which is the ratio of the peak early mitral valve flow velocity to the peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity, should improve the noninvasive estimation of filling pressures in suspected HFNEF. Elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides may confirm HFNEF if tissue Doppler echocardiography is inconclusive. Treatment of HFNEF is symptom oriented and mainly based on pathophysiologic assumptions such as heart rate reduction, blood pressure control, and maintenance of sinus rhythm. In contrast to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, large-scale randomized controlled drug trials for HFNEF are scarce and could not demonstrate mortality reduction so far.", 
    "180": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor zofenopril has been shown to possess cardioprotective effects toward myocardial damage induced by chronic doxorubicin treatment in the rat. In the present study we have investigated the relationship between cardioprotection exerted by 2 angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (zofenopril and lisinopril) and degree of inhibition of cardiac versus serum angiotensin converting enzyme. Both zofenopril and lisinopril produced a dose-dependent inhibition of serum and cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme in rats (0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg/day in the diet for 1 week). However, zofenopril at 0.1 mg/kg/day showed a significantly (P < 0.05) greater inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme in the myocardium than in the serum (delta about 20%). Using dose levels (0.1 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day) which inhibits partially (about 50%) or almost totally (about 80%) serum angiotensin converting enzyme, we evaluated the effects of zofenopril and lisinopril in preventing cardiac alterations (QalphaT prolongation) induced by chronic treatment with doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg q7dx5 i.v.). Zofenopril, at a dose level (0.1 mg/kg/ day) that did not affect haemodynamics and only partially inhibits serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity, almost totally prevent the QalphaT lengthening induced by doxorubicin, whereas lisinopril was ineffective at this dose level. At the higher dose level (10 mg/kg/day), both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors totally prevented the electrocardiographic alteration induced by chronic doxorubicin administration. Cardioprotection exerted by zofenopril at a dose level that partially inhibits serum angiotensin converting enzyme without affecting haemodynamics, suggests that inhibition of cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme and additional cardioprotective mechanism(s) may have a role in its ability to prevent myocardial damages in the rat subjected to chronic anthracycline treatment.", 
    "181": "Previous studies, which have mostly focused on concentrated NaCl solution intake, have suggested sodium depletion may be accompanied with salt taste sensory changes. To further investigate whether the function of the salt taste system changes in different patterns for highly concentrated and diluted NaCl taste stimuli, the effects of sodium depletion on NaCl taste detection threshold in rats were examined. After a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) to a suprathreshold concentration of NaCl (0.1 M) was established, rats were given a series of two-bottle choice tests between distilled water and different concentrations of NaCl. Conditioned rats will generalize the aversion to diluted solutions when they are detected. The taste detection threshold for NaCl is defined as the lowest concentration at which there is a reliable difference in the preference scores between conditioned and control subjects. The results showed that detection threshold for NaCl lay between 0.003 M and 0.005 M in sodium-replete rats, whereas in sodium-depleted rats that have an amplified action of angiotensin II in the brain, the threshold significantly decreased to be between 0.0001 M and 0.0003 M. However, in rats with a blocked action of angiotensin II in the brain the decreased NaCl detection threshold was between 0.001 M and 0.003 M. These findings suggest that sodium-depleted rats could decrease the NaCl taste detection threshold to increase the ability to find sodium ions. And the regulation of the salt taste sensitivity may be related to the action of angiotensin II in brain.",

To date no methods of investigation for the early detection of a reduced nephron reserve are available. However, more structured studies should be implemented to investigate the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in managing proteinurias and glomerulosclerosis in children with renal conditions characterized by reduce nephron number and glomerular hypertrophic changes. In view of the current lack of specific methods of investigation and management, close monitoring of children and young adults at risk of reduced renal reserve should be carried out to enhance the early detection of potential changes in renal function.",

In the Experiment I, rats were given an intravenous injection of PAN (70 mg/kg). Cilnidipine (3 mg/kg/day) and enalapril (CAS 75847-73-3, 5 mg/kg/day) were administered orally from 6 days after treatment with PAN (day 6) to day 26, and urinary analysis was performed on days 9, 15, 20 and 27. In the Experiment II, nephrosis was also induced by intravenous injection of PAN (70 or 100 mg/kg) in rats which were treated with cilnidipine and enalapril from days 6 to 10. Systolic blood pressure was measured on day 7 and urinary analysis was performed on day 10. On day 11, serum was collected and the kidneys were removed for immunofluorescence staining for nephrin and podocin proteins. In PAN-treated rats, the daily urinary protein excretion was dramatically elevated on day 5, reached a peak on day 9 and gradually returned to a normal level from days 15 to 27. Cilnidipine (3 mg/kg/ day) significantly suppressed the increase in proteinuria on day 9 and also improved the decrease in creatinine clearance without evident effect on the blood pressure. Furthermore, the elevations in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride tended to be suppressed by cilnidipine. The expression of nephrin and podocin proteins in PAN-treated rats showed the granular pattern in the glomeruli, while the intensity of staining seemed to be dependent on the urinary protein excretion level in the cilnidipine-treated rats.

Treatments that slow the progression of chronic kidney disease are needed. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor with proinflammatory, mitogenic and profibrotic effects that is closely involved in both normal renal physiology and pathology. Increasing evidence suggests that ET-1 and its cognate receptors are involved in a variety of progressive renal disorders to the extent that renal ET-1 expression correlates with disease severity and renal function impairment. Endothelin receptor antagonists have been used in renoprotection studies owing to their capacity of improving renal hemodynamics and reducing proteinuria. Whether selective ET(A) or non-selective ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonists are preferable is still a matter of debate. As angiotensin II blockers are not invariably effective in retarding disease progression when treatment is started late in the course of the disease, it is foreseeable that an ET-1 antagonist in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors could represent a combined treatment for progressive nephropathies.

In a patient with diabetes, hypertension compounds and greatly increases the risk of microvascular complications, and thus the risk of end-stage kidney disease, vision loss, and nontraumatic limb amputations. Hypertension and hyperglycemia directly damage the microvasculature, leading to small vessel dysfunction that manifests as the clinical disease states of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. Early recognition and treatment of both hyperglycemia and hypertension may prevent vision loss and chronic kidney disease, the devastating outcomes of these microvascular complications. One of the pathogenic mechanisms for microvascular dysfunction is upregulation of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, the most physiologically common receptor for the vasoconstrictor properties of angiotensin II. In patients with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, tight control of blood pressure (BP) (< 130/80 mm Hg) delays the progression of retinopathy and nephropathy in addition to reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Aggressive treatment with 2 or more antihypertensive agents, selected from different drug classes, is often needed to reach the optimal BP target level. A PubMed search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated hypertension control and microvascular outcomes in patients with diabetes. Several clinical trials have yielded promising data with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers). Attainment of BP control with RAAS inhibitors reduces the risk for CVD, nephropathy, and retinopathy.

Whether dual RAAS blockade is more advantageous than single blockade, and in which patients, is also yet to be clearly determined. The Long-Term Impact of RAS Inhibition on Cardiorenal Outcomes (LIRICO) study will compare the cardiorenoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with albuminuria, and clarify the role of dual blockade. Preliminary evidence that RAAS inhibitors reduce incident diabetes is intriguing. Whether ARBs can reduce incident diabetes and related cardiovascular outcomes is awaited with the Nateglinide and Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research (NAVIGATOR) trial.",

    "207": "There were 42 deaths and 193 cardiovascular events among the participants, who were followed for an average of 4.8 years following randomization. A significant association was noted between baseline serum phosphorus >3.9 mg/dL and baseline calcium-phosphorus product >36.8 mg(2)/dL(2) compared with the lowest referent category with the adjusted risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR] 5.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.70-14.72) and (HR 10.01; 95% CI, 2.55-39.31), respectively. However, in time-dependent models using mineral values repeated during the course of the study, only the average of serum phosphorus remains significant (HR 4.25; 95% CI, 1.15 to 16.65).",

Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, aldosterone inhibitors, and cardiac resynchronization therapy was not significantly different between male and female patients, but rates for implantable cardioverter defibrillators, anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, and HF education were significantly lower for females. After adjusting for patient and practice characteristics, 3 of 7 measures significantly differed by patient sex, and 6 of 7 measures by age. Older patients, particularly older women, were significantly less likely to receive guideline-indicated HF therapies.",

Several studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs affect the lipid profile, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Here, it was investigated the lipoprotein metabolism alterations in a group of hypertensive patients in care by the Hypertension and Diabetes Program of a public hospital in Fortaleza-CE/Brazil. In this study, one hundred sixty nine serum samples from hypertensive patients (32-87 years old) under antihypertensive therapy were analyzed. Triglycerides, total cholesterol, cholesterol from high density lipoprotein (HDL) and from low density lipoprotein (LDL) serum levels were determined by enzymatic colorimetric method and AI and B apolipoproteins by immunoturbidimetric assay. The population enrolled was predominantly women (73.13%) and from these, 33.53% taking the monotherapy regimen, used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). However, in combined therapy (66.47%) the most used drugs were the diuretics, especially in prescriptions associated to ACE-I. It was also observed that patients taking diuretics in monotherapy regimen showed significant effects in their serum lipid concentrations of lipids, in contrast with individuals taking combined therapy, which had no expressive alterations in their lipid profile. Theses results suggest that the antihypertensive therapy must be associated to a lipid monitoring process.",

Experiments are complicated by the variation in properties and content of materials that make up the vessel wall and more challenging as the size of the vessel of interest decreases. Therapeutic interventions aiming to alter the mechanical response are either pharmaceutical: including calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and \u03b2-blockers; or, mechanical interventions such as angioplasty, stent placement, mechanical thrombectomy, or embolization procedures.",

However, to achieve this result, a considerable price has been paid in terms of the side effects associated with the intensive anticancer treatment. The most common adverse effect is cardiotoxicity which may compromise the clinical effectiveness of chemotherapy, affecting the patient's survival and quality of life independently of the oncological prognosis. There are 2 types of cardiac toxicities, type I which is more serious and result in permanent damage to the myocardium and type II which is usually reversible. Chemotherapies varies in their incidence of inducing cardiomyopathy, and the onset which may occur acutely (during or shortly after treatment), sub-acutely (within days or weeks after completion of chemotherapy) or chronically (weeks to months after drug administration). Cardiac events associated with chemotherapy may consist of mild blood pressure changes, thrombosis, Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, arrhythmias, myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure (left ventricular failure), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The risk for such effects depends upon: cumulative dose, rate of drug administration, mediastinal radiation, advanced age, younger age, female gender, pre-existing heart disease and hypertension. Serial measurements of LVEF and fractional shortening are the most common indices monitored to assess left ventricular systolic function and cardiotoxicity. This can be achieved by 2-dimensional, M-mode and color Doppler echocardiographic examination; also Cardiac troponins as a biological marker for myocardial damage can be used for monitoring in patients received anthracyclines.

A data set was created that included baseline demographics and characteristics, hospital, course, and clinical outcomes. TC was diagnosed in 70 patients during the study period. Postmenopausal women comprised 95% of the cohort. Six patients presented with cardiogenic shock, 9 required intubation, 3 experienced sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and 1 patient died of cardiac causes. Average ejection fraction was 37% at cardiac catheterization. Troponin-I was increased in all except 1 patient. Follow-up echocardiography showed full recovery of wall motion abnormalities, with an average ejection fraction of 59%. Most patients were treated using standard cardiovascular medications for acute coronary syndrome, and 43% were discharged on warfarin therapy because of severe apical wall motion abnormalities. Univariate analysis suggested that long-term use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors before the onset of TC was protective against cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Consecutive cases grouped into different seasons showed a statistically significant spike in the occurrence of TC during the summer months. In conclusion, the acute phase of this condition may lead to critical illness and death, and use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may have a protective effect. Overall long-term prognosis and recovery of left ventricular function were excellent.", 
    "236": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a common consequence of systemic hypertension associated with poor clinical outcome, is also a potentially reversible condition. Here, we probed the molecular pathways that underpin the development of LVH and their modulation by antihypertensive regimens that reversed LVH. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were studied at 12 (early LVH) and 48 weeks (late LVH), respectively, with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats as age-matched controls. Three treatment groups were maintained for 36 weeks on the following regimens: (1) quinapril, (2) doxazosin and quinapril combination, and (3) losartan. Gene expression profiling was performed with Affymetrix microarrays (GeneChip Rat-230A) and primary function-focused average linkage hierarchical cluster analysis. Of the 15 696 gene sequences expressed on the Affymetrix GeneChip Rat-230A, there was significant alteration in the expression of 295 (1.9%) of these transcripts in 'early' LVH and 143 (0.9%) in 'late' LVH. The predominant changes in gene expression were seen in metabolism, cell growth/proliferation, signal transduction, development and muscle contraction/cytoskeleton functional groups. Although sharing many effects on gene expression, the three treatments showed different expression profiles. Despite significant regression of LVH with treatment, 31 LVH-associated transcripts were unchanged by any of the treatment groups. Our data suggest that LVH regression does not normalize the LVH transcriptome. Therefore, regression of hypertension-induced LVH is associated with a distinct gene expression profile, suggesting the effect of both treatment and a previously unknown specific myocardial physiology after regression of LVH.",

Sunitinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple tyrosine kinase receptors. This drug was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2006 for the treatment of clear cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma and advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We describe a 65-year-old woman who was treated with sunitinib for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. After 5 months of therapy, she developed acute heart failure requiring hospitalization; sunitinib was immediately discontinued. The patient had classic symptoms of heart failure, including pleural effusion. An echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. She received standard treatment for heart failure, including a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and diuretics. Within 1 month, the patient's symptoms resolved, and subsequent cardiac evaluation showed that her left ventricular ejection fraction returned to normal. According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events developed by the National Cancer Institute, her cardiac event associated with sunitinib was defined as grade III toxicity. One month later, sorafenib, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was started with the aim of continuing her previous response to sunitinib. After 7 months of sorafenib therapy, the patient had no evidence of heart failure, and her condition was responding to treatment. Clinicians should be aware that sunitinib-induced heart failure occurs occultly and that many--but not all--cases resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Use of sorafenib after sunitinib-induced heart failure appears to be safe and effective, which suggests that cardiotoxicity is not a general class effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

The success of therapeutic advances has created a challenge for the next generation of investigational heart failure treatments because the mortality rate has decreased to such a degree that larger trials will be needed to demonstrate mortality advantage. Prior work has linked favorable changes in ventricular geometry to improved survival, suggesting that remodeling may be a suitable surrogate endpoint.",

    "255": "Premature atherosclerosis has been observed during the course of different systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and sytemic lupus erythematosus. Remarkably, relatively few studies have been published on the occurrence of accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with vasculitis. In giant cell arteritis (GCA), mortality because of ischaemic heart disease is not increased. In addition, intima media thickness (IMT) is lower in patients with GCA than in age-matched controls. In contrast, IMT is increased significantly in Takayasu arteritis, another form of large vessel vasculitis occurring in younger patients. In Takayasu arteritis and in Kawasaki disease, a form of medium-sized vessel vasculitis, accelerated atherosclerosis has been well documented. In small vessel vasculitis because of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies-associated vasculitis, cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of mortality. IMT measurements reveal conflicting results. During active disease these patients experience acceleration of the atherosclerotic process. However, when inflammation is controlled, these patients have atherosclerotic development as in healthy subjects. Several risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, are present more often in patients with vasculitis compared with healthy controls. In addition, steroids may be pro-atherogenic. Most importantly, many patients have impaired renal function, persistent proteinuria and increased levels of C-reactive protein, well-known risk factors for acceleration of atherosclerosis. Enhanced oxidation processes, persistently activated T cells and reduced numbers of regulatory T cells are among the many pathophysiological factors that play a role during acceleration of atherogenesis. Finally, autoantibodies that may be relevant for acceleration of atherosclerosis are found frequently in elevated titres in patients with vasculitis. Because patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular events, vasculitis should be treated with as much care as possible. In addition, treatment should be considered with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor-1 blockers, statins and acetylsalicyl acid. Finally, classical risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be monitored and treated as much as possible.", 
    "256": "Endothelial dysfunction, which is defined by decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, is associated with an increased number of cardiovascular events. Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is reduced by altered endothelial signal transduction or increased formation of radical oxygen species reacting with NO. Endothelial dysfunction is therapeutically reversible and physical exercise, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor antagonists improve flow-evoked endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with hypertension and diabetes. We have investigated three different approaches, with the aim of correcting endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular disease. Thus, (1) we evaluated the effect of a cell permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic, tempol, on endothelial dysfunction in small arteries exposed to high pressure, (2) investigated the endothelial signal transduction pathways involved in vasorelaxation and NO release induced by an olive oil component, oleanolic acid, and (3) investigated the role of calcium-activated K channels in the release of NO induced by receptor activation. Tempol increases endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in arteries from hypertensive animals most likely through the lowering of radical oxygen species, but other mechanisms also appear to contribute to the effect. While oleanolic acid leads to the release of NO by calcium-independent phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase, endothelial calcium-activated K channels and an influx of calcium play an important role in G-protein coupled receptor-evoked release of NO. Thus, all three approaches increase bioavailability of NO in the vascular wall, but it remains to be addressed whether these actions have any direct benefit at a clinical level.", 
    "257": "The combination of an aldosterone receptor antagonist added to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor has been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular and renal end points in hypertensive humans but can produce hyperkalemia in the common clinical setting of impaired renal function. We investigated the effects of dual therapy on acute and chronic potassium handling in hypertensive humans with renal impairment by conducting a randomized crossover clinical trial of 4 weeks of 40 mg lisinopril/25 mg spironolactone versus placebo in 18 participants with a glomerular filtration rate of 25 to 65 mL/min. Study end points, following an established protocol, were hourly determinations of dynamic renal potassium excretion (mmol/h) and serum potassium (mmol/L) after 35 mmol oral potassium challenge in addition to ambulatory potassium concentration. After 4 weeks, ambulatory potassium concentration was 4.87 mmol/L with lisinopril/spironolactone versus 4.37 with placebo (P<0.001). Lisinopril/spironolactone produced only a modest 0.44 mmol/h reduction in stimulated potassium excretion (P=0.03) but a substantial 0.67 mmol/L increase in serum potassium (P<0.001) in response to 35 mmol potassium; these findings are consistent with impaired extrarenal/transcellular potassium disposition. We found the increase in serum potassium after an oral potassium challenge to be a strong predictor of the increase in ambulatory potassium with lisinopril/spironolactone. Our study suggests that dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade may impair extrarenal/transcellular potassium disposition in addition to reducing potassium excretion in humans with renal impairment, and that acute changes in dynamic potassium handling are predictive of chronic changes in ambulatory potassium concentration with dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade.",

It was reported that inhibition of RAS with angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is effective in prevention of atherosclerosis. Here, we investigated the effects of an ARB or/and an ACEI on atherosclerosis development and periadventitial inflammation in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice. RT-PCR revealed that major RAS components were expressed in periaortic tissue. Ang II infusion significantly increased accumulation of bone marrow derived cells into both neointima (p<0.05) and periaortic tissue (p<0.01). Male ApoE- deficient mice were treated with either vehicle, TA606A (10mg/kg/day, ARB), imidapril (3mg/kg/day, ACEI) or TA606A plus imidapril (TA606A 10mg/kg/day+imidapril 3mg/kg/day, ARB+ACEI) for 24 weeks starting at 12 weeks of age. ARB, ACEI, and ARB+ACEI significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation in aorta compared with vehicle (p<0.05), with reduced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in periaortic tissues (p<0.01). Neither blood pressure nor heart rate was changed by the treatments at these lower doses. Imidapril significantly reduced lipid deposition in atheroma and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression in periadventitial tissue (p<0.05, respectively). Imidapril and combination therapy significantly attenuated macrophage infiltration into the atherosclerotic plaque (p<0.05, respectively).

Also, 7,8-Dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (8-OHGua), which is an indicator of DNA damage level, has been determined in whole blood. After MI diagnosis, the relationships among the 8-OHGua, NO and clinic MI indicators have been determined. Results have been evaluated by comparing with that of control group. In control groups, the clinic MI indicators have been found to be statistically higher than the drug groups. In parallel to this increase in MI indicators, there have been determined a significant decrease in NO levels and an increase in 8-OHGua level. There was no significant difference in the rat groups which received drugs without MI induction. We have observed that the level of 8-OHGua which increased after MI in both acute and chronic periods decreased by LAC, RAM and VAL when compared to acute and chronic MI control groups.

Choice is made based on a drug's proven efficacy, the physician's informed belief about medications not yet evaluated in controlled trials, the drug's adverse events, the patient's preferences and headache profile, and the presence or absence of coexisting disorders. Because comorbid medical and psychologic illnesses are prevalent in patients who have migraine, one must consider comorbidity when choosing preventive drugs. Drug therapy may be beneficial for both disorders; however, it is also a potential confounder of optimal treatment of either.",

    "327": "Patients with NSTEMI were older and were more likely to have prior angina, prior MI and prior heart failure symptoms than STEMI patients. The NSTEMI patients were less likely to be transferred for invasive treatment (23.9 vs. 41.9%, p <0.0001) and receive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors during index hospital stay. The use of low-molecular-weight heparin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II antagonists, nitrates and statins was more frequent in NSTEMI patients. Among patients treated non-invasively, in-hospital mortality was high, but was lower in NSTEMI than STEMI patients (12.1 vs. 22.7%, p <0.0001). Independent predictors of in-hospital death in this group were age, cardiogenic shock, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and STEMI.", 
    "328": "Despite current recommendations, NSTEMI patients are still less likely to be transferred for invasive treatment than STEMI patients. Among patients treated non-invasively during index hospital stay, NSTEMI is associated with more favourable prognosis than STEMI, but the risk of in-hospital death is high. The hospital network should implement more frequently the strategy of early and urgent invasive treatment of NSTEMI patients.", 
    "329": "Drug management of hypertension has been a noticeable example of the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on prescription practices. The worldwide leading brands of blood pressure-lowering agents are angiotensin receptor-blocking agents, although they are considered to be simply substitutes of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Commercial strategies have been based on the results of clinical trials sponsored by drug companies. Most of them presented distortions in their planning, presentation or interpretation that favored the drugs from the sponsor, i.e., corporate bias. Atenolol, an ineffective blood pressure agent in elderly individuals, was the comparator drug in several trials. In a re-analysis of the INSIGHT trial, deaths appeared to have been counted twice. The LIFE trial appears in the title of more than 120 reproductions of the main and flawed trial, as a massive strategy of scientific marketing. Most guidelines have incorporated the corporate bias from the original studies, and the evidence from better designed studies, such as the ALLHAT trial, have been largely ignored. In trials published recently corporate influences have touched on ethical limits. In the ADVANCE trial, elderly patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease or risk factors, allocated to placebo, were not allowed to use diuretic and full doses of an ACE inhibitor, despite the sound evidence of benefit demonstrated in previous trials. As a consequence, they had a 14% higher mortality rate than the participants allocated to the active treatment arm. This reality should be modified immediately, and a greater independence of the academy from the pharmaceutical industry is necessary.", 
    "330": "Gradually the pattern of use of antihypertensive drug agents has changed, from prime use of diuretics and beta-blockers, to preference for the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and the calcium channel blockers. In assessing the value of potentially conflicting evidence, attention should be paid to the hierarchy of evidence, which works its way up through 10 steps from isolated case reports to integrated knowledge.",

We retrospectively reviewed values from the platelet function analyzer-100 test (Dade-Behring, Deerfield, IL) from 1 day before the procedures. The following factors were evaluated for association with aspirin drug resistance: age, sex, body mass index, and smoking history; patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease/ peripheral vascular disease, or hypercholesterolemia; disease pathology (aneurysm, intracranial stenosis, or extracranial stenosis); patients taking statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, or antidepressants; and white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet levels. A stepwise logistic model selection was used to select important factors and their interactions.",

    "339": "The incidence of diabetes mellitus is increasing. Cardiac dysfunction often develops, resulting in diverse arrhythmias. These arise from ion channel remodeling or from altered speed and pattern of impulse propagation. Few studies have investigated impulse propagation in the diabetic heart. We previously showed a reduced conduction reserve in the diabetic heart, with associated changes in intercellular gap junctions. The present study investigated whether these effects are sex specific. Hearts from control and streptozotocin-diabetic male and female rats were used. Optical mapping was performed with the voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS, using Langendorff-perfused hearts. Isolated ventricular cells and tissue sections were used for immunofluorescent labeling of the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43). The gap junction uncoupler heptanol (0.75 mM) or elevated K(+) (9 mM, to reduce cell excitability) produced significantly greater slowing of propagation in diabetic males than females. In ovariectomized diabetic females, 9 mM K(+) slowed conduction significantly more than in nonovariectomized females. The subcellular redistribution (lateralization) of the gap junction protein Cx43 was smaller in diabetic females. Pretreatment of diabetic males with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril reduced Cx43 lateralization and the effects of 9 mM K(+) on propagation. In conclusion, the slowing of cardiac impulse propagation in type 1 diabetes is smaller in female rats, partly due to the presence of female sex hormones. This difference is (partly) mediated by sex differences in activation of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system.",

Many studies using an end-point of proteinuria compared the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy with combination ACE-I/ARB therapy. Despite methodological limitations, most studies suggest that combination therapy provides a greater antiproteinuric effect than monotherapy, perhaps because of more prolonged and complete RAAS inhibition. COOPERATE and ONTARGET used more robust end-points to study renoprotective effects. In COOPERATE, combination therapy resulted in significantly longer times to doubling serum creatinine or developing end-stage renal disease than trandolapril or losartan monotherapy. However, a secondary ONTARGET finding was that combination therapy significantly increased the risk for renal dysfunction compared with ramipril or telmisartan alone. Eventually, the VA NEPHRON-D trial should provide definitive data relating to patients with diabetic nephropathy.",

Donepezil is an AChE inhibitor that is widely prescribed to ameliorate the cognitive impairment of patients with dementia. Six healthy subjects took part in a dynamic study involving a 60-min PET scan after intravenous injection of [(11)C]donepezil. The total distribution volume (tDV) of [(11)C]donepezil was quantified by compartmental kinetic analysis and Logan graphical analysis. A one-tissue compartment model (1TCM) and a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) were applied in the kinetic analysis. Goodness of fit was assessed with chi(2) criterion and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Compared with a 1TCM, goodness of fit was significantly improved by a 2TCM. The tDVs provided by Logan graphical analysis were slightly lower than those provided by a 2TCM. The rank order of the mean tDVs in 10 regions was in line with the AChE activity reported in a previous post-mortem study. Logan graphical analysis generated voxel-wise images of tDV, revealing the overall distribution pattern of AChE in individual brains. Significant correlation was observed between tDVs calculated with and without metabolite correction for plasma time-activity curves, indicating that metabolite correction could be omitted. In conclusion, this method enables quantitative analysis of AChE and direct investigation of the pharmacokinetics of donepezil in the human brain.",

In this study, the physiological activities of cooking drip extracts from H. fusiformis (CDHF) were determined to investigate the effect of a gamma and an electron beam irradiations. DPPH radical scavenging activity and tyrosinase and ACE inhibition effects of the gamma and electron beam irradiated CDHF extracts were increased with increasing irradiation dose. These were reasoned by the increase in the content of the total polyphenolic compound of CDHF by the gamma and electron beam irradiation. There were no differences for the radiation types. These results show that ionizing radiation could be used for enhancing the functional activity of CDHF which is a major by-product in Hizikia fusiformis processing, in various applications.",

At currently, thrombolysis is accepted as standard therapy when PCI is not immediately available. However, PCI is often performed in stable patients with AMI who are/are not received thrombolysis . We performed the trial that enrolled myocardial infarction patients treated with thrombolysis, late PCI and medically to assess the potential benefits of delayed PCI. We follow up 164 consecutive patients after AMI one year. The patients are divided in two groups; first group-66 patients who received reperfusion (37 patients received only thrombolysis, 10 patients received thrombolysis and PCI 7-9 days after thrombolysis and 19 patients underwent only PCI after 7-9 days) and second group-98 patients medically treated. One year mortality was 3% in the reperfusion group (2/66) and 14,3% in the medical group (14/98) (p=0,016). There were not significant differences between groups about other end points-reinfarctus, coronary artery bypass surgery and PCI performed later after discharge. The major predictors of one year mortality were ages (p<0,001) and ejection fraction (p=0,003). Also, therapy with beta-blockers (p=0,002), statins (p=0,001) and ACE-inhibitors (p=0,024) was associated with better survival.

The aim of this study was to present the effects of aggressive treatment of the multiple risk factors for diabetic nephropathy on proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. In this study we included 15 patients with diabetes type 2 and insufficient regulation of glycaemia. The patients were followed for three months period. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides and proteinuria were followed prior and after the study. Prior the study patients were treated with premix insulin divided in two daily doses + metformin after the lunch and they had insufficient regulation of glycaemia. During the study patients were treated with one daily dose of basal insulin, three doses of metformin (2550 mg), one daily dose of atorvastatin (20 mg) and one daily dose of ramipril (5 to 10 mg). Doses of insulin were titrated separately for each patients (0,7-1,0 IU/kg). Patients were advised to start with lifestyle modification, increased physical activity and dietary interventions with protein and salt restriction, energy restricted diet and smoking cessation. A total of 20 patients (male 12 and female 8) with diabetes type 2 were studied. The mean age of the subjects was 53+/-5,25 years. The mean diabetes duration was 4,05+/-1,96 years. The mean body mass index decreased from 28,1+/-1,67 kg/m2 to 25,9 +/-1,22 kg/m2 after the study. Mean HbA1c decreased from 8,82 +/- 0,53 % to 7,15 +/- 0,23 % (p<0,05). Mean fasting glycemia decreased from 8,79+/-0,58 mmol/dm3 to 7,03+/-0,18 mmol/dm3 (p < 0,05). Mean postmeal glycemia decreased from 9,93 +/- 0,77 mmol/dm3 to 7,62 +/- 0,42 mmol/dm3 (p<0,05).

Excised human jejunal mucosa was used to investigate the permeability of the small intestine to four oral drugs, using a flow-through diffusion system. The four drugs were selected as representative model compounds of drug classes 1 and 3 according to the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS). The drugs selected were zidovudine, propranolol HCl, didanosine, and enalapril maleate. Permeability values from our in vitro diffusion model were compared with the BCS permeability classification and in vivo and in vitro gastrointestinal drug permeability. The flux rates of the four drugs were influenced by the length of the experiment. Both class 1 drugs showed a significantly higher mean flux rate between 2 and 6 h across the jejunal mucosa compared to the class 3 drugs. The results are therefore in line with the drugs' BCS classification. The results of this study show that the permeability values of jejunal mucosa obtained with the flow-through diffusion system are good predictors of the selected BCS class 1 and 3 drugs' permeation, and it concurred with other in vitro and in vivo studies.",

However, the number of patients who reach end-stage renal failure is still considerable and there is a great need to identify therapies that can arrest evolution of kidney damage. Maximizing renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade through combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy has been shown to further increase antiproteinuric and nephroprotective effects of each drug class. However, in order to slow to the greatest extent progression of renal disease, the ideal therapeutic approach for patients with proteinuric nephropathies should be a multimodal strategy including dual RAS blockade, antialdosterone therapy, lipid-lowering agents, smoking cessation, and tight glucose control for diabetes.",

However, with the correct clinical skill and experience, most geriatric heart failure can be properly diagnosed and managed. Management of geriatric heart failure can be simplified by following this useful mnemonic: DEFEAT Heart Failure. This covers the essential aspects of geriatric heart failure management: Diagnosis, Etiology, Fluid, Ejection fraAction, and Treatment. The process begins with a clinical Diagnosis, which must be established, before ordering an echocardiogram, as nearly half of all geriatric heart failure patients have normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Because heart failure is a syndrome and not a disease, an underlying Etiology must be sought and determined. Determination of the Fluid volume status by careful examination of the external jugular veins in the neck is vital to achieve euvolemia. An echocardiography should be ordered to obtain left ventricular Ejection frAction to assess prognosis and guide Therapy. However, if left ventricular ejection fraction cannot be determined, as in many developing nations, all geriatric heart failure patients should be treated as if they have low ejection fraction, and should be prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta-blocker. Diuretic and digoxin should be prescribed for all symptomatic patients with heart failure. An aldosterone antagonist may be used in select patients with advanced systolic heart failure, carefully avoiding hyperkalemia.",

    "373": "Atherosclerosis and hypertension are two important pathological vascular processes which share a crucial common pathway: an altered vascular homeostasis characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measured by ultrasound has been shown to correlate with the presence of cardiovascular disease and is now widely accepted as a subclinical marker for atherosclerotic disease. Large body of evidences has shown that antihypertensive drugs exert important anti-atherosclerotic effects, which depend to some extent on the degree of blood pressure lowering provided by these drugs. Many randomized clinical trials of antihypertensive drugs (calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha- and beta-blockers, diuretics, and angiotensin-1 receptor blockers) compared with placebo or no-treatment have demonstrated both a reduction of CIMT, a validated measure of subclinical atherosclerosis and predictor risk for clinical cardiovascular events, than a protection against clinical stroke events. However, important technical aspects of CIMT measurement must be considered. Over the last twenty years there have been great changes in the sensitivity of transducers and hence accuracy of measurement. This review explores the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs in preventing CIMT progression and/or regression.", 
    "374": "ACE inhibition is now recognized as superior to placebo on outcomes in stable coronary artery disease (CAD), including total and cardiovascular mortality, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, revascularization and stroke. This review examines clinical evidence for the mode of action of ACE inhibitors in CAD, which is dominated by the results of a single trial, EUROPA, and its substudies. The generally accepted mode of action for ACE inhibitors in CAD is blood pressure reduction. However, the EUROPA data demonstrate that endothelial protection, with the effect of arresting or reducing the processes of atherosclerosis is also important. Chronic overexpression of tissue ACE in CAD disrupts the angiotensin II/bradykinin balance with a net result of endothelial dysfunction. ACE inhibitors reduce production of angiotensin II, which prevents vasoconstriction, reduces adhesion molecules and growth factors, decreases oxidative stress and prevents apoptosis. A concomitant decrease in the degradation of bradykinin as a result of ACE inhibition raises levels of this kinin, leading to vasodilation and an antiapoptotic action, as well as opposition of the negative actions of angiotensin II. We now have clinical trial evidence of these processes in CAD patients participating in the EUROPA study by measurement of markers of endothelial function, including nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), the rate of apoptosis and levels of von Willebrand factor (vWf). Serum from CAD patients was found to significantly downregulate eNOS protein expression and activity versus that of healthy controls (p < 0.01), most probably as a result of upregulation of tissue ACE. One year of treatment with perindopril upregulated eNOS protein expression and activity (19% and 27% vs placebo; p < 0.05). Similarly, vWf was elevated at baseline and significantly reduced after 1 year of treatment with perindopril (p < 0.001). Increased endothelial apoptosis by serum of CAD patients was accompanied by excess angiotensin II and tumour necrosis factor-alpha and a reduction in bradykinin; all of these parameters were reversed by treatment. We therefore have clinical results showing that perindopril normalizes the angiotensin II/bradykinin balance, reduces inflammation and prevents endothelial apoptosis. Accumulating preclinical evidence for the absence of a class effect for ACE inhibitors includes differences in terms of effect on eNOS and rate of endothelial apoptosis. These differences appear to be related to tissue affinity, penetration of atherosclerotic plaque and affinity for the target enzyme. Consideration of these features is important when administering ACE inhibition as secondary prevention in CAD patients. In this context, current European guidelines for stable angina pectoris recommend prescription of agents and doses with proven efficacy in secondary prevention.", 
    "375": "Royal jelly (RJ) is known to possess several physiological and pharmacological properties. A dipeptide YY derived from RJ proteins is known to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Our previous study showed that the dipeptide YY inhibited the human renin activity at physiological pH. In this study, we investigated the pH dependency of the inhibitory effect of the dipeptide YY to the renin reaction with angiotensinogen. The renin activity was expressed at a wide pH range with two peaks around at 6.0 and 8.0. The dipeptide YY was found to inhibit the renin activity only at the acidic pH range lower than 8.0. The Ki was estimated 4.6 micromol/L at pH 6.0 when the Km of human renin was determined 0.07 micromol/L using sheep angiotensinogen as the substrate. The Km was 0.25 micromol/L at pH 8.5. A stereo structure of the complex of human renin with the dipeptide YY was modeled to discuss its non inhibitory effect on the renin activity at the basic pH. It possibly owes to a local sift of YY space from the center of renin cleft into the N-domain side of renin molecule at basic pH range higher than 8.0.",

    "378": "We identified 42 trials (10,968 participants). With a thiazide used alone, the mean placebo-subtracted reduction in systolic blood pressure was 7.3 mm Hg and 14.6 mm Hg combined with a drug from another class. The corresponding reductions were 9.3 mm Hg and 18.9 mm Hg with a beta-blocker, 6.8 mm Hg and 13.9 mm Hg with an angiotensin-converting enzyme, and 8.4 mm Hg and 14.3 mm Hg with a calcium channel blocker. The expected blood pressure reduction from 2 drugs together, assuming an additive effect, closely predicted the observed blood pressure reductions. The ratios of the observed to expected incremental blood pressure reductions from combining each class of drug with any other over that from 1 drug were, respectively, for thiazides, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers: 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.20), 1.00 (95% CI, 0.76-1.24), 1.16 (95% CI, 0.93-1.39), and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.69-1.09); the overall average was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.90-1.12). Comparison of our results with those of a published meta-analysis of different doses of the same drug showed that doubling the dose of 1 drug had approximately one fifth of the equivalent incremental effect (0.22 [95% CI, 0.19-0.25]).",

Participants included 35 first episode OCD patients and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Relative COMT gene expression levels were examined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in peripheral blood of all the subjects. COMT gene expression levels, normalized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), were significantly decreased in the OCD group compared with healthy controls (F=6.244, p=0.015). OCD patients showed a 32% down-regulation. We also found lower COMT gene expression levels in female in comparison to male participants (F=5.366, p=0.024) in the sample as a whole. COMT gene expression down-regulation of male OCD patients relative to male controls is 38%, and that of female OCD patients relative to female controls is 27%. These results suggest that COMT gene expression down-regulation might play an important role in the development of OCD and that there may be gender differences in this alteration.",

Effects of commonly used cardiac medications on long-term survival of patients >80 years with HF and preserved left ventricular EF were assessed. One hundred forty-two patients were evaluated. During a 5-year follow-up, 98 patients died (69%). There were no significant differences in baseline parameters in patients who died compared with those who survived at 5 years. None of the drug therapies appeared to make a significant difference in long-term survival, including beta blockers (p = 0.89), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (p = 0.91), calcium channel blockers (p = 0.69), diuretics (p = 0.30), digoxin (p = 0.22), and statins (p = 0.32).

Tight metabolic and blood pressure control has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of development as well as progression of retinopathy and remains a cornerstone in the medical management of DR. Laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy are important tools for preventing severe visual loss from sight-threatening DR and its complications. New pharmacological therapies to target the underlying biochemical mechanisms that cause DR are also being evaluated in order to overcome the limitations of current treatment modalities. In this context, the role of protein kinase C inhibitors, intravitreal injections of steroids, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as candesartan, and growth hormone inhibitors is promising. Although treatment can help prevent blindness in a majority of cases, the key variable in the success of therapy lies in identifying patients with retinopathy before their vision is affected. This calls for timely eye examination of diabetic patients. The present article is a comprehensive review of DR with special emphasis on its pathophysiology and management aspects.",

    "392": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the pathological mechanisms of target organ damage, as well as in the induction of hypertension. RAS inhibition by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin (Ang) II receptor blockers can prevent tissue damage by inhibition of Ang II type 1 receptor signaling. A beneficial effect of RAS inhibition on the heart, vasculature and kidney in cardiovascular disease has been reported. However, RAS inhibition can also prevent fibroproliferative diseases and damage of other tissues, such as brain, adipose tissue and muscle, because local RAS has an important role in tissue damage compared with circulating RAS. Moreover, other players, such as Ang II type 2 receptor signaling, aldosterone and ACE2 have been highlighted. Furthermore, there has also been a focus on the emerging concept of regulation of RAS, such as receptor-interacting proteins and receptor modifications, in the new discovery of therapeutic agents for tissue protection. The RAS has a pivotal role in various target organ damage, with complicated mechanisms; therefore, blockade of RAS may be therapeutically effective in preventing organ damage, as well as in having an antihypertensive effect.",

Following this educational program, we investigated the appropriate management of 196 unselected patients with diabetes mellitus, mean age 61 years, who were followed up for at least 1 year in an academic general medicine clinic. The blood pressure was reduced to <130/80 mm Hg in 161 of 196 diabetics (82%). The hemoglobin A1c was reduced to <7.0% in 134 of 196 diabetics (68%). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were used to treat 50 of 51 diabetics (98%) with coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke, or peripheral arterial disease; 33 of 35 diabetics (94%) with a glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m; 54 of 57 diabetics (94%) with microalbuminuria, and 21 of 22 diabetics (96%) with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy.

The separator works by spinning the blood at high speed to separate the cells from the fluid and returning the remaining cells to the patient, while the plasma is discarded and substituted with replacement fluids. Common complications of plasma exchange include the occurrence of hypotensive reactions.

    "403": "Many factors can affect the characterisation of biomaterials during testing. These include drugs administered prior to testing and shear stress on blood cells induced by different blood flows and specific blood donor conditions. Some of the misconceptions in testing are described here and serve to indicate that a systems approach, and not only individual test parameters, is best when testing for biocompatibility. \"Methodology is everything and the devil is in the details\", remarked Paul Simmons, the current president of the International Society for Stemcell Research, in an article in Nature magazine [1]. The article refers to current problems related to the reproducibility of data in stem cell research. Reproducibility in in vitro testing is also mandatory when selecting polymers for medical device applications. Many mechanical and physical engineers are surprised when they realise the enormous standard deviations (sometimes between 50 and 100%) of data found in biological or physiological investigations of biomaterials. The reasons for this are the complexity of physiological parameters such as the nature of blood originating from a variety of donors and hour-to-hour and day-to-day physiological differences. As a consequence, standardisation is a condition sine qua non in biomaterial testing, and knowledge of possible pitfalls is absolutely necessary. Therefore ISO 10993-4, Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices, Selection of Tests for Interaction With Blood, [2] provides a practical tool, including a decision tree for use in the selection of appropriate polymers for biomaterial applications. However, the interested reader finds in Section 3.1 of ISO 10993-4 the definition of blood-device interaction: \"Any interaction between blood or any component of blood and a device, resulting in effects on blood, or on any organ or tissue, or on the device\". A note added to this definition further clarifies: \"Such effects may or may not have clinically significant or undesirable consequences.\" This prompts one to ask if effects leading to undesirable consequences that are not clinically significant would be helpful to the polymer chemist. This article provides some observations and examples of the misconceptions and pitfalls that exist in testing biomaterials for biocompatibility.", 
    "404": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common medical problem and a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Patients with CAD and prediabetic states should undergo lifestyle modifications aimed at preventing DM. In patients with CAD and DM, routine use of aspirin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)-unless contraindicated or not tolerated-and strict glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control are strongly recommended. Intense insulin therapy might be needed for glycemic control, and high-dose statin therapy might be needed for lipid control. For blood pressure control, ACE-Is and angiotensin receptor blockers are considered as first-line therapy. The outcomes after revascularization in diabetic patients are usually worse compared with non-diabetic patients. Advances in PCI include the use of drug-eluting stents and adjunctive drug therapies, such as abciximab. Glycemic control is an important determinant of outcome after revascularization in diabetic patients. Improvements in PCI and coronary artery bypass graft surgery are leading to better results in diabetic patients, and clinical trials are presently comparing contemporary PCI with surgery.", 
    "405": "We tested the hypothesis that small changes in angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) expression can alter the vascular response to injury. Male mice containing one, two, three, and four copies of the Ace gene with no detectable vascular abnormality or changes in blood pressure were submitted to cuff-induced femoral artery injury. Femoral thickening was higher in 3- and 4-copy mice (42.4 +/- 4.3% and 45.7 +/- 6.5%, respectively) compared with 1- and 2-copy mice (8.3 +/- 1.3% and 8.5 +/- 0.9%, respectively). Femoral ACE levels from control and injured vessels were assessed in 1- and 3-copy Ace mice, which represent the extremes of the observed response. ACE vascular activity was higher in 3- vs. 1-copy Ace mice (2.4-fold, P < 0.05) in the control uninjured vessel. Upon injury, ACE activity significantly increased in both groups [2.41-fold and 2.14-fold (P < 0.05) for 1- and 3-copy groups, respectively] but reached higher levels in 3- vs. 1-copy Ace mice (P < 0.05). Pharmacological interventions were then used as a counterproof and to indirectly assess the role of angiotensin II (ANG II) on this response. Interestingly, ACE inhibition (enalapril) and ANG II AT(1) receptor blocker (losartan) reduced intima thickening in 3-copy mice to 1-copy mouse values (P < 0.05) while ANG II treatment significantly increased intima thickening in 1-copy mice to 3-copy mouse levels (P < 0.05). Together, these data indicate that small physiologically relevant changes in ACE, not associated with basal vascular abnormalities or blood pressure levels, do influence the magnitude of cuff-induced neointima thickening in mice.",

    "411": "The beneficial effect achieved by the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in chronic cardiovascular diseases is already an evidence belonging to the basic treatment of the disease. Given the fact that the vascular system is uniform and consubstantial both physiologically, pathophysiologically and in terms of therapy, and that it plays a key role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)--a disease leading to tragic loss of vision with its etiology and therapy being unknown--endothelial dysfunction should be treated. The pleiotropic effects of ACE-inhibitors, AR-blockers and statins and third generation beta blockers help to restitute the balance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in endothelial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress, the balance of growth factors and their inhibitors, pro- and anti-inflammatory substances and prothrombotic and fibrinolytic factors, inhibit the formation of oxidative stress and its harmful effects; while aspirin with its pleiotropic effects acting as an antiaggregation substance on platelets helps to set the endothelial layer back to its normal balance regarding its vasodilating, antithrombotic, antiadhesive and anti-inflammatory functions; trimetazidine as an adjuvant agent helps to normalize, to restore the disturbed metabolism of the retinal tissue functioning insufficiently, in the end. The angiotensin II receptor blocker telmisartan with its peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist effect inhibits the development of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) and improves it clinically favourably. The third generation beta adrenergic receptor blocker carvedilol and nebivolol as well as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist pioglitazone elicit their antioxidant vascular protective effects mitochondrially. For the above reasons it is suggested that, as a part of long term primary and/or secondary prevention, the following groups of patients with AMD receive--taking into consideration all possible side effects--ACE-inhibitor and/or AR blocker and statin and aspirin treatment, and trimetazidine as adjuvant medicine, and third generation beta adrenergic receptor blockers: 1. those without macular degeneration but being above the age of 50 and having risk factors inducing endothelial dysfunction; 2. those, who already developed AMD in one eye as a prevention in the second, unaffected eye; and 3. those patients who developed AMD in both eyes in order to ameliorate or merely slow the progression of the disease. Besides, it is advisory and important to eliminate AMD risk factors (cardiovascular risk factors also) inducing oxidative stress with consecutive endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "412": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) is a well-established biomarker for assessing the efficacy of various antihypertensive agents such as direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). PRA measurements are obtained through the detection and quantification of angiotensin I (Ang I) produced by the action of renin on its natural substrate angiotensinogen. The most accepted and reproducible method for PRA measurement uses an antibody capture Ang I methodology that employs specific antibodies that recognize and protect Ang I against angiotensinase activities contained in plasma. The amount of Ang I is then quantified by either radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme immunoassay (EIA). In the current report, we describe the optimization of a novel homogeneous immunoassay based on the AlphaScreen technology for the detection and quantification of antibody-captured Ang I using AlphaLISA acceptor beads in buffer and in the plasma of various species (human, rat, and mouse). Ex vivo measurements of renin activity were performed using 10 microl or less of a reaction mixture, and concentrations as low as 1 nM Ang I were quantified. Titration curves obtained for the quantification of Ang I in buffer and plasma gave similar EC(50) values of 5.6 and 14.4 nM, respectively. Both matrices generated an equivalent dynamic range that varies from approximately 1 to 50 nM. Renin inhibitors have been successfully titrated and IC(50) values obtained correlated well with those obtained using EIA methodology (r(2)=0.80). This assay is sensitive, robust, fast, and less tedious than measurements performed using nonhomogeneous EIA. The AlphaLISA methodology is homogeneous, does not require wash steps prior to the addition of reagents, and does not generate radioactive waste.",

ABT-869 demonstrates tumor growth inhibition in multiple preclinical animal models and in early clinical trials. VEGF receptor inhibition is also associated with reversible hypertension that may limit its benefit clinically. To evaluate optimal therapeutic approaches to prevent hypertension with VEGF receptor inhibition, we characterized the dose-dependent effects of seven antihypertensive agents from three mechanistic classes [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs)] on hypertension induced by ABT-869 in conscious telemetry rats. We report that ABT-869-induced hypertension can be prevented and reversed with subtherapeutic or therapeutic doses of antihypertensive drugs with a general rank order of ACEi > ARB > CCB. In SCID mice, the ACE inhibitor, enalapril (C(20)H(28)N(2)O(5) x C(4)H(4)O(4)) at 30 mg/kg, prevented hypertension, with no attenuation of the antitumor efficacy of ABT-869.

More benign forms of idiopathic VT can also occur in the absence of structural heart disease. Treatment of VT involves both emergent management and prevention of recurrence with medical and device therapy. Appropriately selected patients who have experienced VT or those who are at risk of VT may be candidates for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The left ventricular ejection fraction is most frequently used to stratify patients with either ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy who are at risk of sudden death and may be candidates for a prophylactic defibrillator.

This prothrombotic/hypercoagulable state in hypertension may contribute to the increased risk and severity of target organ damage. It can be induced by the activated renin-angiotensin system (RAS), with abnormalities in endothelial and platelet function, coagulation and fibrinolysis. Treatment of uncomplicated essential hypertension by RAS targeting antihypertensive therapy could result in a reversal of prothrombotic abnormalities, contributing to a reduction of thrombosis-related complications. Since angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have two distinct mechanisms of RAS interruption, it is hypothesized that each therapy might have different impact on the prothrombotic state in hypertensive patients. Some studies demonstrate a beneficial effect of both ACE inhibitors and ARBs on prothrombotic state, in addition to their efficacy to normalize elevated blood pressure. The potentially antithrombotic effect of the RAS inhibiting agents may in turn support the preservation of cardiovascular function. Available data may offer an additional explanation for the efficacy of the RAS targeting agents in the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

The observed rate constants for transnitrosation are all first-order with respect to the respective thiols. The second-order rate constants which were determined at physiological temperature, 37 degrees C are 258+/-8, 159+/-3, 66.7+/-1.3 and 37.4+/-0.6 M(-1) s(-1), respectively. The second-order rate constants decreased according to the sequence LCEE > CapSH > GSH > NALC. The activation parameters (DeltaH(not equal) and DeltaS(not equal)) were derived from the Eyring's equation. The experimental activation parameters were then correlated by an isokinetic plot, for the reduction of [Co(III)TSPc(NO(-))](4-) by the thiols, making use of the expression: DeltaH(double dagger) = DeltaG(0)(double dagger) + beta(0)DeltaS(double dagger) where DeltaG(o)(double dagger) is the intrinsic free energy of activation, and beta(o) the isokinetic temperature. The plot which showed very good linearity (R(2) = 0.997), gave values of DeltaG(o)(double dagger) (61+/-1 J K(-1) mol(-1)) from the intercept, and beta(o) (260+/-11 K) from the slope.

We show that small liver grafts generated Ang II after ROLT and that this was associated with increased angiotensinogen and ACE messenger RNA expression. Furthermore, inhibition of Ang II did not contribute to PC-induced protection in ROLT. All Ang II blockers reduced hepatic injury, but none of them promoted liver regeneration. Bradykinin (BK) receptor antagonist improved liver regeneration but did not reduce hepatic injury in ROLT. Finally, the combination of Ang II blockers and BK receptor antagonists in ROLT reduced hepatic injury and improved liver regeneration. In conclusion, treatments with either Ang II blockers or BK receptor antagonists cannot, on their own, improve the outcome of ROLT. Although Ang II blockers can reduce hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury and BK receptor antagonists can promote liver regeneration, neither confers both benefits at the same time. Consequently, it may be of clinical interest to apply both treatments simultaneously.",

Revascularized patients had a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (45.2%), percutaneous coronary intervention (42.1%), or both (12.8%). Compared with nonrevascularized patients, revascularized patients at baseline demonstrated a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease risk factors and risk conditions (P<0.001). This higher prevalence was the principal cause of a higher incidence of primary outcome (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) among revascularized patients (14.2% versus 8.5% for nonrevascularized patients; P<0.001). However, both patient groups demonstrated a relatively low incidence of subsequent revascularization (5.1% versus 1.5% respectively; P<0.0001). Associations between adjusted hazard ratio for primary outcome and follow-up blood pressure appeared \"J shaped\" for both patient groups.

The complexity of current treatment guidelines may contribute to this problem. To determine whether a simplified treatment algorithm is more effective than guideline-based management, we studied 45 family practices in southwestern Ontario, Canada, using a cluster randomization trial comparing the simplified treatment algorithm with the Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines. The simplified treatment algorithm consisted of the following: (1) initial therapy with a low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretic or angiotensin receptor blocker/diuretic combination; (2) up-titration of combination therapy to the highest dose; (3) addition of a calcium channel blocker and up-titration; and (4) addition of a non-first-line antihypertensive agent. The proportion of patients treated to target blood pressure (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg for patients without diabetes mellitus or systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg for diabetic patients) at 6 months was analyzed at the practice level. The proportion of patients achieving target was significantly higher in the intervention group (64.7% versus 52.7%; absolute difference: 12.0%; 95% CI: 1.5% to 22.4%; P=0.026). Multivariate analysis of patient-level data showed that assignment to the intervention arm increased the chance of reaching the target by 20% (P=0.028), when adjusted for other covariates.

Suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin 2 receptor blockers or a renin inhibitor should be the primary therapy. A second goal should be suppression of the sympathetic nervous system utilizing a beta-blocker that does not increase insulin resistance. The addition of a diuretic, calcium channel blocker or a vasodilator to suppressors of the RAS and sympathetic nervous system aid in achieving hypertensive goals in the diabetic patient.

Ideally, antihypertensive therapy should maintain control of BP throughout the 24-h dosing cycle. In two sister studies, Prospective, Randomized Investigation of the Safety and efficacy of Micardis vs Ramipril Using ABPM (ambulatory BP monitoring) (PRISMA) I and II, BP control was compared in patients with essential hypertension (24-h mean baseline ambulatory BP approximately 148/93 mm Hg) randomized to the angiotensin receptor blocker, telmisartan (80 mg; n=802), or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril (5 or 10 mg; n=811), both dosed in the morning. The primary end point was the change from baseline in mean ambulatory systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) during the final 6 h of the 24-h dosing cycle. The adjusted mean treatment differences in the last 6-h mean ambulatory SBP/DBP were -5.8/-4.2 mm Hg after 8 weeks and -4.1/-3.0 mm Hg after 14 weeks, in favour of telmisartan (P<0.0001 for all four comparisons). Secondary end point results, including the mean 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, day- and night-time BP and 24-h BP load, also significantly favoured telmisartan (P<0.0001). Both treatments were well tolerated; adverse events, including cough, were less common with telmisartan. These findings suggest that telmisartan is more effective than ramipril throughout the 24-h period and during the EMBPS; this may be attributable to telmisartan's long duration of effect, which is sustained throughout the 24-h dosing period.", 
    "546": "TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB play important roles in the development of inflammation in chronic renal failure (CRF). In hepatic cells, curcumin is shown to antagonize TNF-alpha-elicited NF-kappaB activation. In this study, we hypothesized that if inflammation plays a key role in renal failure then curcumin should be effective in improving CRF. The effectiveness of curcumin was compared with enalapril, a compound known to ameliorate human and experimental CRF. Investigation was conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats where CRF was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx). The Nx animals were divided into untreated (Nx), curcumin-treated (curcumin), and enalapril-treated (enalapril) groups. Sham-operated animals served as a control. Renal dysfunction in the Nx group, as evidenced by elevated blood urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine, proteinuria, segmental sclerosis, and tubular dilatation, was significantly reduced by curcumin and enalapril treatment. However, only enalapril significantly improved blood pressure. Compared with the control, the Nx animals had significantly higher plasma and kidney TNF-alpha, which was associated with NF-kappaB activation and macrophage infiltration in the kidney. These changes were effectively antagonized by curcumin and enalapril treatment. The decline in the anti-inflammatory peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) seen in Nx animals was also counteracted by curcumin and enalapril. Studies in mesangial cells were carried out to further establish that the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin in vivo was mediated essentially by antagonizing TNF-alpha. Curcumin dose dependently antagonized the TNF-alpha-mediated decrease in PPARgamma and blocked transactivation of NF-kappaB and repression of PPARgamma, indicating that the anti-inflamatory property of curcumin may be responsible for alleviating CRF in Nx animals.",

In the present study, we measured the inhibitory effects of 15 drugs and 1 compound on CES activity using liver and jejunum microsomes and cytosol in human and rat. In addition, the inhibition constant (K(i) values) and patterns were determined for the compounds exhibiting strong inhibition. Hydrolysis of imidapril and irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) is catalyzed mainly by CES1 and CES2, respectively. In the inhibition study, imidaprilat formation from imidapril in human liver was strongly inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and procainamide. The inhibition profile and pattern were similar in human liver and rat liver. The compounds showing potent inhibition were similar between liver and jejunum. The K(i) value of NDGA (K(i) = 13.3 +/- 1.5 microM) in human liver microsomes was 30-fold higher than that in rat liver microsomes (K(i) = 0.4 +/- 0.0 microM). On the other hand, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) formation from CPT-11 was not inhibited except by carvedilol, manidipine, and physostigmine.

The recommended thresholds to initiate treatment to lower BP are 130/80 and 125/75 mmHg for people with diabetes and nephropathy, respectively. We sought to determine the effects of lowering BP below these currently recommended thresholds on renal outcomes among 11,140 patients who had type 2 diabetes and participated in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: preterAx and diamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study. Patients were randomly assigned to fixed combination perindopril-indapamide or placebo, regardless of their BP at entry. During a mean follow-up of 4.3 yr, active treatment reduced the risk for renal events by 21% (P < 0.0001), which was driven by reduced risks for developing microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria (both P < 0.003). Effects of active treatment were consistent across subgroups defined by baseline systolic or diastolic BP. Lower systolic BP levels during follow-up, even to <110 mmHg, was associated with progressively lower rates of renal events. In conclusion, BP-lowering treatment with perindopril-indapamide administered routinely to individuals with type 2 diabetes provides important renoprotection, even among those with initial BP <120/70 mmHg. We could not identify a BP threshold below which renal benefit is lost.",

Patients in cardiac failure received various combinations of diuretics, inotropes, and captopril. In addition, 6 received carvedilol, and 3 intravenous immunoglobulin. Death occurred in 2 patients shortly after admission, one left the hospital against medical advice, and the remaining 29 were followed-up for a mean of 37 months, with a range from 2 to 102 months. Recovery was noted in one-third of the patients, with one-quarter showing improvement but still requiring anti-failure medications. Slightly over two-fifths died.

The study included 40 rats allocated into five groups: control, nephrotic syndrome without treatment, dual therapy (DT) with enalapril + losartan, triple therapy (TT) with enalapril + losartan + simvastatin, and quadruple therapy (QT) with enalapril + losartan + simvastatin + a high dose of immunoglobulin. The proteinuria levels were not statistically different between DT, TT and QT groups at weeks 5, 8, 12 and 16. At week 16, serum creatinine levels in the QT group were significantly lower than those in the control, DT and TT groups. The glomerulosclerosis index in the DT group was significantly lower than in the TT and QT groups. The scores for interstitial fibrosis and TGF-beta staining were similar among treatment groups. In conclusion, we showed that quadruple therapy including immunoglobulin had a beneficial effect on renal function in the late phase, but it had no additional effects in reducing proteinuria or in glomerulosclerosis score in experimental nephrotic syndrome. Further studies with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) and immunoglobulin combinations would offer some benefits in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome.",

Pre-LVAD renin levels were 100x normal and resulted in almost complete cardiac angiotensinogen depletion. In non-ACE-I users, LVAD support, by normalizing blood pressure, reversed this situation. Cardiac aldosterone decreased in parallel with cardiac renin, in agreement with the concept that cardiac aldosterone is blood-derived. Cardiac norepinephrine increased seven-fold, possibly due to the rise in angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy prevented these changes: renin and aldosterone remained high, and no increase in norepinephrine occurred.",

However, the role of ACE2 in the regulation of cardiac structure and function, as well as maintenance of systemic blood pressure, remains poorly understood. In cell culture, ACE2 overexpression led to markedly increased myocyte volume, assessed in primary rabbit myocytes. To assess ACE2 function in vivo, we used a recombinant adeno-associated virus 6 delivery system to provide 11-week overexpression of ACE2 in the myocardium of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. ACE2, as well as the ACE inhibitor enalapril, significantly reduced systolic blood pressure. However, in the heart, ACE2 overexpression resulted in cardiac fibrosis, as assessed by histological analysis with concomitant deficits in ejection fraction and fractional shortening measured by echocardiography. Furthermore, global gene expression profiling demonstrated the activation of profibrotic pathways in the heart mediated by ACE2 gene delivery.

However, the chronic nephrotoxicity of these drugs is the Achilles' heel of current immunosuppressive regimens. In this review, the authors summarize the clinical features and histologic appearance of both acute and chronic calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity in renal and nonrenal transplantation, together with the pitfalls in its diagnosis. The authors also review the available literature on the physiologic and molecular mechanisms underlying acute and chronic calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, and demonstrate that its development is related to both reversible alterations and irreversible damage to all compartments of the kidneys, including glomeruli, arterioles, and tubulo-interstitium. The main question--whether nephrotoxicity is secondary to the actions of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on the calcineurin-NFAT pathway--remains largely unanswered. The authors critically review the current evidence relating systemic blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus to calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, and summarize the data suggesting that local exposure to cyclosporine or tacrolimus could be more important than systemic exposure. Finally, other local susceptibility factors for calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity are reviewed, including variability in P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4/5 expression or activity, older kidney age, salt depletion, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and genetic polymorphisms in genes like TGF-beta and ACE.

Male Wistar rats underwent experimental MI or sham operation. Infarcted animals received daily i.c.v. injections of captopril (approximately 200 mg/kg; MI + Cap) or saline (MI) from 11 to 18 days after infarction. Electro- and echocardiogram assessments were performed before and after i.c.v. treatment (10 and 18 days after MI, respectively). Water and hypertonic saline ingestion were determined daily between 12 and 16 days after MI. 3. Electrocardiograms from the MI and MI + Cap groups showed signs that resembled large MI before and after i.c.v. treatment. However, despite similar systolic dysfunction observed in both groups, only captopril-treated rats exhibited reduced left ventricular (LV) dilatation and improved LV filling, as assessed by echocardiograms, and low levels of water ingestion compared with the saline-treated control group. 4.

However, blood pressure control remains poorly achieved in the general population, particularly in high- or very-high-risk hypertensive patients.

A greater use of fixed-combination therapies, based on a single daily administration of two drugs, in fact, may favor better compliance and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications. Among the possible fixed-dose combinations, the one based on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers, may be considered an effective, safe and well-tolerated approach and may provide a beneficial impact on cardiovascular risk.

    "645": "Atherothrombosis has long been recognized as an important mechanism of cardiac events in ischemic heart disease, and large multicenter clinical studies have shown the benefit of antiplatelet agents, statins, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing these events. However, more recent studies have been less successful at showing incremental gains in targeting these mechanisms, suggesting that the limits of this strategy have been exploited. Coronary vasoconstriction is another important mechanism in ischemic heart disease but has received little attention and yet is a potential therapeutic target. In the current review, the reasons why coronary vasconstriction has received insufficient consideration are explored. In particular, we need to change our approach from lumping heterogeneous clinical entities together to focusing on clinically-discrete homogeneous groups with a common mechanism and thus therapeutic target. The role of coronary vasoconstriction is examined in the various ischemic syndromes (variant angina, chronic stable angina, acute coronary syndromes and syndrome X) and the underlying mechanisms discussed. Finally, in order to advance studies in this field, an innovative research strategy is proposed, including: (1) selection of paradigmatic cases for the various ischemic syndromes; (2) candidate therapeutic targets; and (3) approaches in assessing the clinical efficacy of these potential therapies.", 
    "646": "Chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure are closely interlinked; an abnormality in one system adversely impacts upon the function of the other. Despite the wealth of evidence available for beneficial treatment strategies in chronic heart failure, the prognosis remains poor and optimum therapy under-utilised. The applicability of proven therapies to patients with co-morbidity remains a particular challenge, especially since marked renal impairment has often been an exclusion criteria in major studies. In this article we discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of the two conditions and then focus on the aspects of treatment most pertinent to those patients with heart failure patients and concomitant chronic kidney disease.", 
    "647": "Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction represents a frequent clinical condition and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Diastolic dysfunction is the most common cause of HF-PSF (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). Therefore it becomes important to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying diastolic dysfunction, as well as the effective therapeutic strategies able to antagonize its development and progression. Among the complex pathophysiological factors that may contribute to the development of diastolic dysfunction, the RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) has been shown to play a significant role. Paracrine and autocrine signals of the RAAS promote structural and functional changes in the heart largely linked to increased myocardial fibrosis. Enhanced and dysregulated activity of the RAAS also contributes to the development of volume overload and vasoconstriction with subsequent increases in left ventricular diastolic filling pressures and a higher susceptibility of developing CHF (congestive heart failure). More recently, it has also been suggested that the RAAS may play a role in triggering myocardial and vascular inflammation through the activation of different cell types and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. RAAS-induced myocardial inflammation leads to perivascular myocardial fibrosis and to the development or progression of diastolic dysfunction. For these reasons pharmacological blockade of the RAAS has been proposed as a rational approach for the treatment of diastolic dysfunction. In fact, ACEIs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers) and AAs (aldosterone antagonists) have been demonstrated to delay the development and progression from pre-clinical diastolic dysfunction towards CHF, as well as to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.",

Curiously, the experimental data shown that both peptides stabilized in solution and in solid-state neutral H2N-R-COOH form. Conformational analysis made, shown two strong intramolecular NH2-O=C-N(Amide) and O=C-OH-NH2 hydrogen bonds with lengths of 2.979 A and 2.475 A in (1) and 2.599 A and 2.507 A in (2) respectively. The presence of the Pro-Pro fold resulted to strong steric effect leading to the stabilization of free COOH and NH2 groups. The Erel values of zwitterion form are significant higher than the neutral forms with a difference of 1.2 and 0.9 kJ/mol. The manner of interaction of the peptides with angiotensin-I converting enzyme is proposed.", 
    "649": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade is a key component in the modern management of cardiovascular diseases. Agents that interfere with the different components of this system such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, sartans and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists represent valuable therapeutic tools to reduce cardiovascular risk in brachial blood pressure independent mechanisms. Indeed, antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduce inflammation, oxidative stress and vascular remodeling in hypertension beyond blood pressure reduction and have demonstrated better cardiovascular protection compared with some of the other antihypertensive agents, especially in selected populations such as patients with diabetes and renal failure. These advantages were confirmed recently in several large-scale randomized trials. Latest evidence suggests that the effect of some antihypertensive drugs on central blood pressure is greater when compared with the effect on peripheral pressure. Nowadays, there is growing agreement that relatively greater influence of agents blocking renin-angiotensin system on central blood pressure may at least partly explain their advantages over other antihypertensives in many clinical situations. Clinical consequences of overestimation of the antihypertensive effect of some drug classes and underestimation blood pressure changes in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors when analyzing brachial instead of central blood pressure is being increasingly recognized recently.",

Based on epidemiological projections for the aging U.S. population, the number of hospitalizations for HCAP is expected to increase exponentially for the next several decades. The unique risk factors for colonization with resistant pathogens in these patients provide multiple opportunities for HCAP prevention. However, our current understanding of the most effective prevention measures is woefully inadequate and constitutes an extrapolation from studies done in community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia patients. This review explores common prevention strategies that may be applicable to HCAP, highlights areas of controversy that require further study, and describes several areas of ongoing novel investigation.",

Based on the results of coronary angiography performed during the first three days of STEMI, the patients were divided into two groups: Group I (n=33), consisting of patients with remaining total occlusion of the IRA, and Group II (n=19), consisting of patients with spontaneous thrombolysis. We assessed the endothelial function, using the brachial artery FMD test.",

After 7-14 days, this difference disappeared because of significant elevation of the FMD levels in the first group. Group I was characterized by higher levels of high sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), cholesterol, and cholesterol-LDL and lower usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors before STEMI.", 
    "654": "The data presented above reveal that spontaneous coronary thrombolysis in patients with acute STEMI is associated with a preserved endothelium-dependent vasodilator response in the brachial artery.

Rabbit tongues showed moderate degeneration of taste buds caused by tinidazole, severe degeneration of captopril and minimal changes of valsartan. In humans, the drugs did not result in significant changes in serum zinc or magnesium. Approximately 73.3% of patients in the metronidazole group and 11.1% in the valsartan group had taste changes.",

    "665": "Despite the advances in pharmacotherapy for heart failure due to reduced left ventricular function, mortality still remains high and many patients are hospitalized over time due to worsening heart failure symptoms. There is some experimental evidence that vasoconstriction and nitric oxide (NO) deficiency in the vasculature play a role in aggravating the symptoms of heart failure, especially in patients of African-American origin. Treatment with high doses of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) has been shown to increase symptom-free walking time, but tolerance to the hemodynamic effects of ISDN develops rapidly. Experimental data suggests that hydralazine, given concomitantly, attenuates the development of hemodynamic tolerance to ISDN and may increase bioavailability of NO in the vasculature. In a racially mixed population, treatment with a combination of ISDN and hydralazine reduced mortality compared to placebo to a nearly statistically significant extent in the first Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT I) but was inferior to treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in the V-HeFT II study. Subgroup retrospective analysis of published data, however, suggested that ISDN/hydralazine had a substantial effect in black patients and was apparently as effective as treatment with the ACE inhibitor, enalapril, in the same population, but had a much smaller, if any, effect in white patients. A recent placebocontrolled study showed that in self-identified black patients with heart failure, ISDN/hydralazine, given in addition to current state-of-the-art pharmacotherapy for heart failure, reduces mortality and first hospitalizations due to heart failure and improves quality of life. The usefulness of ISDN/hydralazine in ethnic groups other than self-identified blacks is unknown at present and is considered off-label use. This review focuses on ISDN/hydralazine for the management of patients with heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction and the adverse effects which may be encountered with therapy.", 
    "666": "The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in many cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and atherosclerosis, is well established, whereas its relationship with cardiac arrhythmias is a new area of investigation. Atrial fibrillation and malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, especially in the setting of cardiac hypertrophy or failure, seem to be examples of RAAS-related arrhythmias because treatment with RAAS modulators, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, reduces the incidence of these arrhythmias. RAAS has a multitude of electrophysiological effects and can potentially cause arrhythmia through a variety of mechanisms. We review new experimental results that suggest that RAAS has proarrhythmic effects on membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum ion channels and that increased oxidative stress is likely contributing to the increased arrhythmic incidence. A summary of ongoing clinical trials that will address the clinical usefulness of RAAS modulators for prevention or treatment of arrhythmias is presented.",

Additional risk factors, organ damage, diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation were consistently reported in hypertensive patients.

Therefore, we aimed to study the association between the use of antihypertensive drugs and CRPS onset. We conducted a population-based case-control study in the Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) database in the Netherlands. Cases were identified from electronic records (1996-2005) and included if they were confirmed during an expert visit (using IASP criteria), or if they had been diagnosed by a medical specialist. Up to four controls per cases were selected, matched on gender, age, calendar time, and injury. Exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics was assessed from the automated prescription records. Data were analyzed using multivariate conditional logistic regression. A total of 186 cases were matched to 697 controls (102 confirmed during an expert visit plus 84 with a specialist diagnosis). Current use of ACE inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of CRPS (OR(adjusted): 2.7, 95% CI: 1.1-6.8). The association was stronger if ACE inhibitors were used for a longer time period (OR(adjusted): 3.0, 95% CI: 1.1-8.1) and in higher dosages (OR(adjusted): 4.3, 95% CI: 1.4-13.7).

With regard to blood pressure, a small additional fall with dual RAS blockade was observed when compared with that seen in monotherapy. Numerous studies have shown a reduction of albuminuria with dual RAS blockade. However, the recent findings in the ONTARGET (Renal Outcomes With Telmisartan, Ramipril, or Both, in People at High Vascular Risk) study of significantly more doubling of the creatinine and dialysis in the combination arm despite lesser albuminuria emphasized the fallacy of surrogate end points and argue against nephroprotective effects of dual RAS blockade. In heart failure, dual RAS blockade was associated with more hypotension, worsening of renal function, and hyperkalemia than was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy alone. In conclusion, recent outcome and safety data have shattered the halo of dual RAS blockade for hypertension, nephroprotection, and heart failure. Unless data emerge to the contrary, dual RAS blockade should no longer be used in clinical practice.",

However, morbidity and mortality rates for advanced HF remain unacceptably high, and the course of HF remains progressive so that patients end to a stage characterized by severe symptoms, poor quality of life, high hospitalization and mortality rates. Heart transplantation represents an effective surgical treatment for advanced HF, yet the interest for alternative surgical options has progressively increased due to shortage of donors and frequent contraindications.

These patients have an increased risk of complications after an acute coronary syndrome both during the acute phase and in the post-infarction period. Experimental evidences showed an increased prevalence of atherosclerosis as well as platelet and coagulation abnormalities in patients with diabetes, even after data adjustment for other risk factors. Both hyperglycemia and insulin resistance play a role in the pathogenic link between diabetes and atherosclerosis.

As a sensitivity analysis, the proportion of patients receiving two separate products who could be switched to a combination product was varied from 60-100%. This analysis was done for Alberta and Canada.",

Telmisartan, an ARB, has recently been identified as a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). On the other hand, since endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are thought to play a critical role in ischemic diseases, we investigated effects of telmisartan on proliferation of EPCs.",

Four days after starting culture, adherent cells were collected, and equal numbers of cells were reseeded into methylcellulose medium with or without telmisartan. In the presence of telmisartan, numbers of colonies increased in a dose-dependent manner. DiI-AcLDL uptake and lectin and CD31, CD34 staining revealed that these colonies were EPCs. Increase in colony number by treatment with telmisartan was absolutely inhibited when cultured with a specific inhibitor of PPARgamma. In addition, we observed that specific inhibitors of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) abolished telmisartan-stimulated increase of monocytic EPC-like cells and telmisartan induced phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, mRNA expression of p21 was downregulated in a dose dependent manner, suggesting that growth inductive effects of telmisartan might be regulated by the PI3K/Akt and p21 signaling pathway.",

The incremental cost of valsartan, compared with placebo, was 2680 pound per patient, although the incremental effectiveness of valsartan was 0.5021 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per patient. Therefore, the incremental cost per QALY for treatment with valsartan was 5338 pound. When analysis was undertaken using life-years rather than QALYs, the cost per life-year gained was 4672 pound.",

For young adults with CAKUT two questions are paramount: what is the prognosis and what is the best management to improve outcome? The paediatric literature shows that prognostic factors are glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the presence of proteinuria. We reviewed data from 101 young adult patients with either primary vesico-ureteric reflux and renal dysplasia or obstructive uropathy. Patients had an estimated GFR (eGFR) of <or=60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) body surface area and had had at least 5 years of follow up (median 162 months). There was a strong correlation between the amount of proteinuria at the start and overall rate of decline. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) slowed declining renal function at all levels of function, but this only had a significant effect on renal outcome when eGFR was >35 ml/min. The ACEI benefit increased with time. Rate of decline was slower than reported for other diseases and was only -2.4 ml/min per year for those reaching the start of dialysis. Outcome is predictable by the level of residual renal function (GFR). Nevertheless, function remains stable while proteinuria is minimal. Short-term studies overestimate rates of deterioration.", 
    "718": "Antihypertensive drugs exert a number of blood pressure-independent benefits. However, demonstrating the clinical significance of these effects may be difficult for a number of reasons. First, blood pressure can be measured in the clinic, at home and over the 24-h period by ambulatory monitoring. Second, differences between these measures mean that achieving equivalent blood pressure reductions in two treatment arms may be difficult, if not impossible. Furthermore, even small differences in blood pressure can translate into significant effects on cardiovascular risk, especially in the later stages of the cardiovascular continuum. In large clinical trials, other errors limiting the sensitivity to treatment differences include high patient dropouts and unplanned crossover. In addition, as so many patients fail to achieve blood pressure goals even in clinical trials where patient's and physician's motivation is high, the need for cardiovascular protection beyond blood pressure control is unequivocal. Clinical trials of angiotensin II receptor blockers have suggested significant effects beyond blood pressure control, which are observed throughout and with greater consistency in the early phases of the cardiovascular continuum. There may also be differences between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Conclusive demonstration that these blood pressure-independent effects do exist will require, however, a much more accurate and extended assessment of the blood pressure effects of the drugs.",

In this study, effect of new sulfur-containing ACE inhibitor, 3-thienylalanine-ornithine-proline (TOP), was studied on blood pressure (BP) and oxidative stress in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs). Acute oral administration of 5 mg/kg of TOP significantly lowered systolic blood pressure for longer periods (18 +/- 0.5 hours, P < 0.05 vs. 16 +/- 0.5 hours) than captopril (20 mg/kg). Thiophene ring of TOP is devoid of free sulfur and may avoid early oxidation resulting in longer duration of action. Chronic oral administration of TOP (5 mg/kg twice a day) for 7 days lowered BP from 189.1 +/- 2.5 to 161.7 +/- 2.6 mm Hg (P < 0.05), decreased the ACE activity, and increased the nitrite levels in various tissues (P < 0.05) and serum (P <or= 0.001). Furthermore, TOP significantly increased antioxidants like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione and decreased lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde significantly.

CES1 and CES2 differ distinctly in their substrate specificity and tissue distribution. In this study, we investigated the role of CES1 and CES2 in converting the antihypertensive prodrug trandolapril to its more active form trandolaprilat, and determined the influence of two newly identified CES1 mutations p.Gly143Glu and p.Asp260fs on trandolapril metabolism. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CES1 is expressed in human liver microsomes (HLM) but not in human intestinal microsomes (HIM). In vitro incubation studies were conducted to contrast the enzymatic activity of HLM as well as HIM upon trandolapril hydrolysis. Trandolapril was rapidly hydrolyzed to its principal active metabolite trandolaprilat after incubation with HLM. In contrast, in HIM, where CES2 is predominantly expressed, incubations did not produce any detectable trandolapril hydrolysis. Furthermore, hydrolysis of trandolapril catalyzed by wild type (WT) and mutant CES1 were assessed utilizing transfected Flp-In-293 cells stably expressing WT CES1 and two variants. WT CES1 efficiently hydrolyzed trandolapril to trandolaprilat with V(max) and K(m) values of 103.6+/-2.2 nmole/min/mg protein and 639.9+/-32.9muM, respectively. However, no appreciable trandolapril hydrolysis could be found after incubation with both p.Gly143Glu and p.Asp260fs variants. Thus, trandolapril appears to be a CES1 selective substrate while CES2 exerts little to no catalytic activity towards this compound. CES1 mutations p.Gly143Glu and p.Asp260fs are essentially dysfunctional enzymes with regard to the conversion of trandolapril to its more active metabolite trandolaprilat.",

There is also evidence that angiotensin II exerts detrimental effects on progression and instabilization of atherosclerotic plaque. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can be inhibited through inhibition of angiotensin I (Ang I) generation from angiotensinogen by direct renin inhibitors, inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II) generation from angiotensin I by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and finally by direct inhibition of the action of Ang II receptor level. Aliskiren, the first direct renin inhibitor to reach the market, is a low-molecular-weight, orally active, hydrophilic nonpeptide. Aliskiren blocks Ang I generation, while plasma renin concentration increases because the drugs blocks the negative feed-back exerted by Ang II on renin synthesis. Because of its long pharmacological half-life, aliskiren is suitable for once-daily administration. Its through-to-peak ratio approximates 98% for the 300 mg/day dose. Because of its mechanism of action, aliskiren might offer the additional opportunity to inhibit progression of atherosclerosis at tissue level. Hypertension is an approved indication for this drug, which is also promising for the treatment of heart failure. The efficacy of this drug in reducing major clinical events is being tested in large ongoing clinical trials.",

In patients with hypertensive kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) significantly reduce the risk of renal and cardiovascular endpoints. Whether the renoprotective effects of RAS inhibitors can be fully accounted for by blood pressure reductions or whether other mechanisms are involved has not been clearly established. Because RAS inhibitors reduce albuminuria and slow progression of kidney disease, they are recommended as fi rst-line antihypertensive agents in patients with CKD, who often require aggressive treatment with > or = 2 drugs to reach the goal blood pressure (< 130/80 mm Hg). Greater RAS inhibition with higher-than-usual doses of a single agent or dual RAS inhibition with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker may be necessary for maximum renoprotective effects. Ongoing clinical trials assessing treatment and prevention of CKD may resolve unanswered questions about RAS inhibition in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes.",

Patients with idiopathic SRNS secondary to minimal change disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis should receive similar therapy. Effective regimens include treatment with calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, cyclosporine), intra-venous cyclophosphamide or a combination of pulse corticosteroids with oral cyclophosphamide, and tapering doses of alternate day corticosteroids.

Although DBP control did not differ in the PWV tertiles, SBP control was significantly associated with PWV level (p = 0.001) as well as with the use of perindopril/indapamide (p < 0.001).

ARBs may have a small benefit in terms of stroke risk, but the studies are heterogenous, making it very difficult to quantify this effect.

    "780": "Systemic hypertension is a long-term risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease and when uncontrolled is a short-term trigger of acute vascular events such as acute coronary syndromes and stroke. Thus, rapid reduction in BP is desirable. Patients at high risk for vascular disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, have aggressive goal BP targets because studies have shown that achieving these targets reduces events. Given the dual goals in high-risk patients of reducing BP quickly and to aggressively low targets, the classic 'step therapy' of one drug titrated at a time to reduce BP is inadequate. Combination therapy with at least two potent medications makes more sense, and manufacturers are now increasing their offerings of single-pill combinations for hypertension. Combination pills are popular with patients and increase compliance with therapy. Many believe that renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers are the cornerstone of hypertension treatment in patients at high risk for vascular disease. The newer combination pills include a RAAS blocker and diuretics or a long-acting calcium channel antagonist (CCA). Recent studies have shown that a RAAS blocker plus a dihydropyridine CCA is superior to older diuretic-based combinations for preventing cardiovascular events. These considerations support a new approach to the higher risk hypertensive patient: effective doses of RAAS blocker/CCA combination pills to rapidly lower BP to <130/80 mmHg.", 
    "781": "The influence of various formulation properties on the chemical stability of captopril in aqueous media at pH 3 was investigated, in order to reformulate and increase the shelf-life of an oral mixture of the drug. At this pH, chemical stability is improved by an increase in drug concentration (1-5 mg/ml) and a decrease in temperature (5-36 degrees C), the latter demonstrated by a linear Arrhenius-plot. The activation energy is low (Ea = 10.2 kcal/mol), thus the Q10 value is only 1.8 in pure aqueous solutions. The degradation at the lowest concentration investigated in pure aqueous solution apparently follows zero order kinetics. The reaction order is changed at higher concentrations. We are presenting a hypothesis of intramolecular proton transfer from the thiol to the ionized carboxylic group as the initial step in the oxidative degradation pathways of captopril. Long-term stability of 1 mg/ml captopril in aqueous solutions at pH 3, stored at 36 degrees C for one year, shows that the sugar alcohol sorbitol accelerates degradation of the drug while Na-EDTA at a concentration as low as 0.01% is sufficient to stabilize these samples. Purging with N2-gas prior to storage is not essential for drug stability, as long as Na-EDTA is present. Only at a low level of Na-EDTA (0.01%) combined with a high level of sorbitol (35%), purging with N2-gas appears to have a small effect. The destabilizing effect of sugar alcohols is confirmed by accelerated degradation also in the presence of glycerol. The efficient stabilization in the presence of Na-EDTA at a low concentration indicates that the metal-ion-catalyzed oxidation pathway dominates the chemical degradation process at low pH, although several mechanisms seem to be involved depending on excipients present.",

As reported, the renal survival rate is 61% at 20 years and the renal prognosis of this disease is relatively poor on long-term observation, hence various protocols have been attempted to control this disease. At Iizuka Hospital, a prospective study of tonsillectomy with methylprednisolone pulse therapy was performed for the treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy from August 2002. We reviewed the clinical efficacy of our protocol. From August 2002 to July 2006, 31 patients whose IgA nephropathy was demonstrated by percutaneous renal biopsy were administered our regimen. In our study, 12 patients had an observation period of more than 24 months. Our protocol consisted of tonsillectomy with one course of methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Methylprednisolone at the daily dose of 1,000 mg for 3 consecutive days followed by oral steroid at the daily dose of 20 mg, was gradually tapered, and discontinued one year later. All of the patients were administered angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with favorable control of hypertension.

We observed that transgenic rats (TGR) overexpressing the human renin gene (hREN) developed moderate obesity with increased body fat mass and glucose intolerance compared with nontransgenic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The metabolic changes were not reversed by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a direct renin inhibitor, or by (pro)renin receptor blocker treatment. The obese phenotype in TGR(hREN) originated from higher food intake, which was partly compensated by increases in resting energy expenditure, total thermogenesis (postprandial and exercise activity), and lipid oxidation during the first 8 weeks of life. Once established, the difference in body weight between TGR(hREN) and SD rats remained constant over time. When restricted to the caloric intake of SD, TGR(hREN) developed an even lower body weight than nontransgenic controls. We did not observe significant changes in the cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript, pro-opiomelanocortin, both anorexigenic, or neuropeptide Y, orexigenic, mRNA levels in TGR(hREN) versus SD controls. However, the mRNA level of the agouti-related peptide, orexigenic, was significantly reduced in TGR(hREN) versus SD controls at the end of the study, which indicates a compensatory mechanism. We suggest that the human renin transgene initiates a process leading to increased and early appetite, obesity, and metabolic changes not related to angiotensin II.

Unfortunately, long-term outcome of medical therapy alone is suboptimal, with a reported 30-50% mortality rate at 5 years and a delayed expansion of the false lumen in 20-50% of patients at 4 years. In this setting, endovascular treatment should be considered when the aortic diameter exceeds 55-60mm, in case of uncontrolled pain, blood pressure and rapid growth of the dissecting aneurysm (>1cm per year). About 30-42% of acute, type B aortic dissections are complicated, as evidenced by haemodynamic instability or peripheral vascular ischaemia with a mortality rate of 50-85% if not treated properly.

The L-arginine-NO pathway is closely related to oxygen transport to tissue. Endothelial dysfunction in patients with arterial hypertension can affect haemoglobin-oxygen affinity and tissue oxygen supply. Alterations in blood oxygen transport indices may play role in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the beta-selective adrenoblocker nebilet (nebivolol) on blood oxygen transport indices and on endothelial dysfunction in patients with arterial hypertension. The study population included 52 patients with grade II and grade III arterial hypertension. The results of our studies indicate that endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients significantly changes blood oxygen indices. The endothelium can be involved in formation of these impairments because only NO synthesized in sufficient amounts can maintain normal blood flow and oxygen transport to tissues. Endothelial dysfunction impairs formation of different haemoglobin NO-derivatives, that influence not only on the release of NO at different sites of the vascular bed, but also on haemoglobin-oxygen affinity, and accordingly, on optimal blood oxygenation in capillaries of pulmonary circulation and its deoxygenation in capillaries of systemic circulation. Treatment of hypertensive patients with nebivolol corrects the blood oxygen transport indices, stimulates NO production and improves endothelium-dependent dilatation. Normalization of blood oxygen transport indices may regulate the activity of the L-arginine-NO pathway. Thus, nebivolol may improve efficiency of the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "816": "Aliskiren is the first member of the new class of orally active direct renin inhibitors to receive approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hypertension. In patients with hypertension, aliskiren can be used either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. By inhibiting renin, aliskiren blocks the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which subsequently results in a reduction in angiotensin II concentrations. Unlike the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which reactively stimulate an increase in plasma renin activity, aliskiren suppresses the effects of renin and leads to a reduction in plasma renin activity. In clinical trials involving patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, aliskiren provided antihypertensive efficacy that was comparable to that of an ARB. Combination therapy with aliskiren and an ARB may provide additional blood pressure-lowering effects compared with the respective monotherapies with each of the agents. The results from surrogate outcome studies have also alluded to the potential for aliskiren to prevent target organ damage. Because aliskiren does not significantly affect the cytochrome P450 system, it has been associated with few drug interactions. In clinical studies, aliskiren was well tolerated, and its adverse-effect profile was similar to that of placebo. Fatigue, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and back pain were the most commonly reported adverse events. Overall, aliskiren appears to be a reasonable treatment option for patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension who are intolerant of first-line antihypertensive therapies. Aliskiren may also be a promising renoprotective strategy in patients with concomitant hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Its potential as a first-line antihypertensive agent will have to be further examined once studies evaluating its effects on long-term clinical outcomes are completed.", 
    "817": "Captopril and mesna are molecules with a free thiol group, used as active ingredients due to their hypotensor and mucolytic properties, respectively. These compounds cross the hematoencephalic barrier and, due to the reactivity of their thiol group, can form adducts with the o-quinones formed during the oxidation of mono- and o-diphenols. Polyphenol oxidase from plants and fungi can be used as a tool for generating o-quinones in their action on o-diphenols and facilitate the formation of adducts in the presence of captopril or mesna. The spectrophotometric characterization of these adducts is useful from several points of view. Here, using the end-point method, which involves the exhaustion of oxygen in the medium, we determined the molar absorptivity of the adducts of different o-diphenols with captopril and mesna. Besides the analytical interest of this approach, we also use it to make a kinetic characterization of polyphenol oxidase as it acts on o-diphenolic substrates that produce unstable o-quinones.", 
    "818": "A step nonisothermal experiment under high oxygen pressure and a new computation with optimization for step nonisothermal experiment on stability study of drugs was introduced. The kinetics parameters of captopril oxidation in aqueous solution were determined by this method. It is reported that the reaction of captopril solution occurs under either aerobic or anaerobic condition, giving different products. Then the total rate constant k(total) can be expressed as [image omitted] where k(anaerobic) and k(aerobic) are the rate constants of anaerobic and aerobic degradations, respectively. The results indicated that the parameters obtained in the step nonisothermal experiment were comparable with those obtained in the isothermal-isobaric experiments. By a computer simulation, the estimates for the kinetic parameters (E(a) and k(0)) obtained with step nonisothermal method were statistically evaluated. Results indicated that the estimates obtained with isothermal-isobaric method were somewhat more precise than those obtained with step nonisothermal method. However, the experimental period needed by isothermal-isobaric method was much longer than that needed by step nonisothermal method.", 
    "819": "Since the advent of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, little attention has been given to the potential proinflammatory effects of aldosterone in high-volume states on the kidney and cardiovascular system. In order to be correctly interpreted, aldosterone levels require a volume cofactor which can now be determined by measurement of extracellular fluid volume by means of bioimpedance. Chronic kidney disease patients frequently have expanded extracellular volume (ECV) in the presence of elevated aldosterone levels. This combination may lead to cardiovascular and renal inflammation and fibrosis that can be mitigated by more precise control of ECV and/or blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor.",

Both fixed- and random-effect models were used. In trials vs. placebo, the risk of CHF was reduced by 21% with ACEIs (P = 0.007), whereas the effect of ARBs and CCBs was not significant (random-effect models). Thus, CCBs did not increase the risk of CHF. In trials vs. diuretics/beta-blockers, no differences were found between ACEIs and comparators [odds ratio (OR) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-1.24], whereas CCBs were associated with an 18% higher risk of CHF (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.00-1.39; P = 0.048). Therefore, ACEIs were not superior to diuretics/beta-blockers for the prevention of CHF. Because heterogeneity between trials was significant, we investigated potential sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression. The risk of CHF decreased by 24% (P < 0.001) for each 5 mmHg reduction in systolic BP. The risk of CHF was 19% less with ACEIs/ARBs than CCBs (P < 0.001) and 16% less in studies without multiple risk factors required for entry (P = 0.009).",

We examined the influence of Ang-(1-7), both endogenous and after chronic treatment with the peptide (576microg/(kgday)), on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiac dysfunction in streptozotocin-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (diabetic SHR). In isolated perfused hearts, recovery of left ventricular function from 40min of global ischemia was improved significantly in Ang-(1-7)- or captopril-treated diabetic SHR and worsened in animals treated with A779, an Ang-(1-7) receptor (AT((1-7))) antagonist. The beneficial effect of captopril on cardiac recovery was reduced when co-administered with A779. Cardiac NF-kappaB activity appears to be higher in diabetic SHR and treatment with Ang-(1-7) or captopril decreased NF-kappaB activity in diabetic SHR, an effect partially reversed by co-administration of A779. Real-time PCR-based gene array analysis of cardiac tissue revealed that Ang-(1-7) or captopril treatment may reduce expression of several genes of inflammation involved in the NF-kappaB signalling pathway. The data provide for the first time a role for endogenous Ang-(1-7) as well as confirmation that exogenous treatment with the peptide produces cardioprotection. Whether potential anti-inflammatory and transcriptional factor changes are directly linked to the cardioprotection produced by Ang-(1-7) in diabetic SHR remains to be determined.", 
    "828": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in hypertension and the continuum of cardiovascular and kidney disease. The inhibition of this system, either with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), has been shown to be beneficial for cardiorenal protection. Dual blockade with an ACE inhibitor and ARB may have additional benefits due to the more complete inhibition of the system. Most published trials, including recent large studies and meta-analyses, have reported either limited or no additional benefit. Dual-blockade therapy seems to have some benefit on proteinuria and blood pressure reduction, and on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, compared with monotherapy. The major issue arising from these published trials and meta-analyses is the increased frequency of dual therapy discontinuation and adverse effects on kidney function. There is a lack of hard end-point data for renal outcomes and long-term safety data in most published trials. Until the results of ongoing trials become available and as further safety data emerge, a wise approach would be to withhold use of ACE inhibitor and ARB combination therapy in general practice. When used in selected conditions, patients need to be closely monitored.", 
    "829": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition induces glomerular repair in the Munich Wistar Fr\u00f6mter (MWF) rat, a model of spontaneous glomerular injury. In this study, we investigated whether this effect is related to changes in glomerular cell number, particularly of podocytes, which are progressively lost with age. MWF rats with advanced nephropathy were studied at both 40 weeks and after 20 weeks of observation either with or without treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. Forty-week-old Wistar rats were used as controls. In untreated MWF rats, proteinuria, hypertension, glomerulosclerosis, and renal function worsened, while lisinopril induced regression of both functional and structural changes. Despite glomerular hypercellularity in untreated MWF rats, the number of endothelial cells per glomerulus did not change, and podocyte number even decreased. ACE inhibition halted the progressive increase in glomerular cell number and enhanced endothelial cell volume density. Surprisingly, lisinopril not only halted age-related podocyte loss but also increased the number of glomerular podocytes above baseline, which was associated with an increased number of proliferating Wilms tumor 1-positive cells, loss of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 expression, and increased number of parietal podocytes. These data indicate that ACE inhibition restructures glomerular capillary, primarily by restoring the podocyte population in this model of glomerular injury. Increased parietal podocyte number in lisinopril-treated MWF rats suggests that the remodeling of Bowman's capsule epithelial cells contributes to this effect.", 
    "830": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 is a homolog of the well-characterized plasma membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme. ACE2 is thought to play a critical role in regulating heart function, and in 2003, ACE2 was identified as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We have recently shown that like ACE, ACE2 undergoes ectodomain shedding and that this shedding event is up-regulated by phorbol esters. In the present study, we used gel shift assays to demonstrate that calmodulin, an intracellular calcium-binding protein implicated in the regulation of other ectodomain shedding events, binds a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 762-777 within the cytoplasmic domain of human ACE2, forming a calcium-dependent calmodulin-peptide complex. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ACE2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells specifically binds to glutathione-S-transferase-calmodulin, but not glutathione-S-transferase alone, in pull-down assays using cell lysates. Finally, to investigate whether calmodulin has any effect on ACE2 ectodomain shedding in cells that endogenously express the enzyme, cells from a human liver cell line (Huh-7) expressing ACE2 were incubated with calmodulin-specific inhibitors, trifluoperazine and calmidazolium. Both trifluoperazine (25 micromol/liter) and calmidazolium, (25 micromol/liter) significantly increased the release of ACE2 into the medium (44.1 +/- 10.8%, P < 0.05, Student's t test; unpaired, two-tailed, and 51.1 +/- 7.4% P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, respectively;), as analyzed by an ACE2-specific quenched fluorescence substrate assay. We also show that the calmodulin-specific inhibitor-stimulated shedding of ACE2 is independent from phorbol ester-induced shedding. In summary, we have demonstrated that calmodulin is able to bind ACE2 and suggest that the ACE2 ectodomain shedding and/or sheddase(s) activation regulated by calmodulin is independent from the phorbol ester-induced shedding.",

Cases (n=24) were defined as all PD patients that met the criteria for sudden death during January 2003 through December 2006. We also selected 48 control subjects that were selected from the prevalent PD patient name list compiled in alphabetical order. Data on the hemoglobin, potassium, and calcium levels, residual renal function, dialysis adequacy, cardiovascular risks, comorbid conditions, concurrent use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and erythropoietin, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings were extracted from case notes and computer records. Confounders were controlled by logistic regression.", 
    "833": "Over a period of 4 years, 24 PD patients (mean age 61.4+/-9.5 years, median duration of dialysis 3.1 years) experienced sudden death. Univariate analyses showed that patients that died suddenly were more likely to be male and to have diabetes mellitus, a history of smoking, and a lower small solute clearance as measured by Kt/V. Cases of sudden death were also more likely to have received blood transfusion within the previous 1 year. There were no significant differences between patients and controls for residual renal function, serum potassium levels, control of blood pressure and mineral metabolism, or hemoglobin levels. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed independent association between recent blood transfusion and increased odds of sudden death [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-18.6]. Two other factors significantly associated with risk of sudden death were male gender (adjusted OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.14-15.2) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR 5.33, 95% CI 1.53-18.6).",

    "835": "Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) diminishes NO production from activated macrophages. The interaction between LDL and inactivated macrophages is neglected and controversial. This study examines the effect of LDL, 7-oxysterols and iron compounds on NO production in unstimulated J774 macrophages. J774 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were either incubated for 24 h with native LDL (LDL) or ultraviolet (UV)-oxidized LDL (UVoxLDL), in the absence or presence of an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)- or an endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-inhibitor. J774 cells were also incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the absence or presence of an iNOS- or an eNOS-inhibitor. Nitrite was analysed as a marker of NO production. The mRNA levels of iNOS were evaluated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. LDL and UVoxLDL significantly increased NO production from unstimulated J774 macrophages. This increase in NO was accompanied by enhanced expression of iNOS mRNA, and was inhibited by the iNOS inhibitor. Furthermore, NO production was elevated and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was reduced in HUVEC following the exposure to LDL and UVoxLDL. In conclusion, LDL may serve as an important inflammatory activator of macrophages and HUVEC, inducing inducible nitric oxide production but diminishing ACE. After its oxidation, this function of LDL may be further enhanced and may contribute to the regulation and progression of atheroma formation.", 
    "836": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is known to play an essential role in controlling sodium balance and body fluid volumes, and thus blood pressure. In addition to the circulating system which regulates urgent cardiovascular responses, a tissue-localized renin-angiotensin system (RAS) regulates long-term changes in various organs. Many recognized RAS components have also been identified in the human eye. The highly vasoconstrictive angiotensin II (Ang II) is considered the key peptide in the circulatory RAS. However, the ultimate effect of RAS activation at tissue level is more complex, being based not only on the biological activity of Ang II but also on the activities of other products of angiotensinogen metabolism, often exerting opposite effects to Ang II action. In recent studies, orally administered angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lower intra-ocular pressure (IOP), likewise topical application of these compounds, the effect being more prominent in ocular hypertensive eyes. Based on previous findings and our own experimental data, it can strongly be suggested that the RAS not only regulates blood pressure but is also involved in the regulation of IOP.",

Databases searched were Medline (1966-March 2008), EMBASE (1988-March 2008) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Six trials in 3694 patients met the inclusion criteria. All examined aliskiren, the only renin inhibitor licensed for marketing in Canada and the United States. Aliskiren caused a dose-related SBP/DBP lowering effect compared to placebo: weighted mean difference with 95% CI: aliskiren 75 mg, -2.9 (-4.6, -1.3)/-2.3 (-3.3, -1.3) mm Hg; aliskiren 150 mg, -5.5 (-6.5, -4.4)/-3.0 (-3.7, -2.3) mm Hg; aliskiren 300 mg, -8.7 (-9.7,-7.6)/-5.0 (-5.6, -4.3) and aliskiren 600 mg, -11.4 (-13.5, -9.2)/-6.6 (-7.9, -5.2) mm Hg. Aliskiren 300 mg significantly lowered both SBP -3.0 (-4.0, -2.0) and DBP -1.7 (-2.3, -1.0) as compared to aliskiren 150 mg. Aliskiren has no effect on blood pressure variability. No data were available to assess the effect of aliskiren on heart rate or pulse pressure. This review found weak evidence that during 4- to 8-week use, aliskiren did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects as compared to placebo. We concluded that aliskiren has a dose-related blood pressure lowering effect better than placebo and magnitude of effect is similar to that determined for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.",

A total of 18 OC users (8 non-diabetic, 10 Type 1 diabetic) were studied in high salt balance, a state of maximal RAA System suppression. Progestational and androgenic activity of the progestin in each OC was standardized to that of the reference progestin norethindrone. Renal plasma flow (RPF) was measured by para-aminohippurate clearance at baseline and in response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. There was a positive correlation between OC progestational activity and the RPF response to ACE inhibition (r=0.52, P=0.03). Similar results were noted with OC androgenic activity (r=0.54, P=0.02). On subgroup analysis, only non-diabetic subjects showed an association between progestational activity and angiotensin-dependent control of the renal circulation (r=0.71, P=0.05 non-diabetic; r=0.14, P=0.7 diabetic; P=0.07 between groups). Similar results were noted with respect to androgenic activity (r=0.88, P=0.005 non-diabetic; r=-0.33, P=0.3 diabetic; P=0.002 between groups).

Results of our simulation study aimed at testing the reproducibility of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow demonstrate that for a fixed overall dose of 12 ml gadolinium-based contrast material (500 mmol/l), the second dose should be approximately twice as large as the first dose. A three-compartment model for analyzing the second-injection data was shown to appropriately handle the tracer residue from the first injection. The optimized protocol was applied to 18 hypertensive patients without renovascular disease, showing minimal systematic difference in GFR measurements before and after ACEi of 0.8 +/- 4.4 ml/min or 2.7 +/- 14.9%. For 10 kidneys with significant renal artery stenosis, GFR decreased significantly after ACEi (P < 0.001, T value = 3.79), and the difference in GFR measurements before and after ACEi averaged 8.3 +/- 6.9 ml/min or 26.2 +/- 43.9%.

The purpose of this work was to study the effect of cooking methods on the production of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides. Boiled or fried eggs (in the forms of whites, yolks, and whole eggs) were digested by gastrointestinal tract proteases at simulated gut conditions. Fried egg digests showed more potent activity than those of boiled egg digests; the fried whole egg digest had an IC(50) value of 0.009 mg protein/mL. This hydrolysate was further purified by cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Seven peptides, Val-Asp-Phe (IC(50): 6.59 microM), Leu-Pro-Phe (10.59 microM), Met-Pro-Phe (17.98 microM), Tyr-Thr-Ala-Gly-Val (23.38 microM), Glu-Arg-Tyr-Pro-Ile (8.76 microM), Ile-Pro-Phe (8.78 microM), and Thr-Thr-Ile (24.94 microM), were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and their IC(50) values were predicted by using our previously reported structure and activity models. The presence of several tripeptides from in vitro simulated gastrointestinal egg digest indicates that these peptides may be absorbed into the body and exert an in vivo antihypertensive activity, although in vivo study is needed to confirm this assumption.

Most of the patients die or develop end-stage renal failure during the neonatal period. The long-term prognosis of renal dysfunctions of patients with ARB fetopathy has not been reported. We report two pediatric cases, a 6- and 2-year-old boy, respectively, with ARB fetopathy whose renal functions were thoroughly evaluated after recovery from neonatal renal failure. Both patients showed (1) mildly decreased glomerular filtration rate, (2) no significant proximal tubular dysfunctions, and (3) salt-losing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, while the excretion of arginine vasopressin and urine level of cyclic AMP were increased. The data on these two patients indicate that the administration of ARB to the fetus profoundly impairs the urine concentrating ability, probably due to papillary atrophy and the disturbed formation of the osmotic gradient in the medulla, which have been confirmed in neonatal rats administered with ACEIs or ARBs.

    "871": "Oxidative stress is a key feature in vascular homeostasis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by multiple enzymatic sources located in various anatomical structures of the vascular wall, such as the vascular endothelium, the smooth muscle cells and inflammatory cells infiltrating sub-endothelial space and the rest of the vascular wall. Although ROS behave as signaling molecules regulating important aspects of vascular physiology, their excess generation is harmful. Further to the cytotoxic effect of ROS in the vascular wall, they also activate various redox sensitive transcription pathways, regulating the expression of proinflammatory molecules with strong pro-atherogenic effects. The activation of redox-sensitive enzymatic systems in the vascular wall such as matrix metalloproteinases as well as the impairment of endothelial function have a significant impact on vascular elasticity and vascular mechanics in general. The impairment of vascular mechanics has a significant impact on vascular homeostasis, promoting atherogenesis. It is therefore crucial to regulate vascular redox signaling, by developing therapeutic strategies able to target the effectively intracellular ROS bioavailability. Statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, folates, tetrahydrobiopterin and other therapeutic strategies seem promising in targeting vascular redox signaling, although it is still unclear which of these treatments have the potential to effectively prevent atherogenesis. Future studies need to define the key redox sensitive pathways in the vascular wall in order to develop effective therapeutic strategies against atherosclerosis.", 
    "872": "The blood pressure (BP) waveform varies substantially between the peripheral conduit (brachial) and the central elastic (aorta) arteries mainly do a gradual increase of systolic BP, as the wave propagates distally. This phenomenon is called BP amplification and is principally generated by the presence of arterial stiffness gradient and wave reflections along the arterial bed. More and more clinical studies suggest that central BP may provide additional information regarding cardiovascular risk beyond peripheral BP. Arterial properties and thus pressure amplification, are modulated by age, cardiovascular risk factors, vasoactive substances and drugs. Recent evidence suggests, beyond any doubt, that antihypertensive drugs affect peripheral and central BP differentially and alter pressure amplification. The aim of the present review (Part II) is to summarize the available evidence regarding: (i) the specific class-effect of antihypertensive drugs on central BP beyond peripheral BP, as well as the potential underlying hemodynamic mechanisms, (ii) head to head comparison of the effect of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on central BP, (iii) the effect of combination drug treatment on central BP. Finally to attempt an interpretation of the clinical trials in hypertension, which classically record brachial BP, based on the results of studies which assessed central BP. Several conclusions were drawn. First, it is clear that there are important differences between the classes of antihypertensive drugs regarding their effects on BP amplification. Second, it seems that the newer antihypertensive drugs [angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers and dihydropyridine calcium blockers], as well as nitrates, have a more beneficial effect on BP amplification than the older drugs (diuretics and BBs). Third, there is compelling evidence regarding the detrimental effect of BBs (mainly atenolol) on central BBs and convincing evidence that ACEIs increase BP amplification.", 
    "873": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent arrhythmia and responsible for significant morbidity, mortality and health care cost. The prevalence of AF is expected to increase markedly with the aging population. The use of conventional antiarrhythmic agents has been limited by potentially fatal ventricular proarrhythmia. Rhythm control could become the preferred treatment strategy for AF if antiarrhythmic agents that are similarly or more effective, but safer, than currently approved AF agents become available. A subanalysis of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-Up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial data showed that normal sinus rhythm confers a survival benefit in AF, suggesting that rhythm control, if achieved without the adverse effects related to current antiarrhythmic medications, may offer a significant survival advantage over rate control. Considerable work has been performed to explore novel, potentially safer antiarrhythmic drug targets for AF therapy, and some of these drug targets are currently being tested in experimental and clinical proof of concept studies. This article summarizes relevant aspects of the cellular electrophysiology of AF and reviews the actions of pharmacological agents being considered for the prevention and treatment of AF, focusing on atrial selective antiarrhythmic agents. A variety of drugs that inhibit the atrium-specific ultra rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKur) are being evaluated pre-clinically, but human experience with these agents is limited. The acetylcholine-activated current (IKACh) is another novel candidate target for atrial-specific drug therapy. The constitutively active form of this current is increased in human AF and pharmacological inhibition might be of therapeutic value. Certain drugs have IKACh blocking properties, but similar to IKur-blockers, none have been shown to have pure selectivity for this current. Newer agents being studied also include gap junction modulators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. There is great hope that at least some of these agents will ultimately be available for effective and safer clinical treatment and prevention of AF.", 
    "874": "ABSTRACT Heart failure continues to be the leading cause of hospitalization among older adults. Noncompliance with medications, dietary indiscretion, failure to recognize symptoms, and failed social support systems contribute to increased morbidity. Multidisciplinary medical approaches have proven successful for heart failure. In 2004, the Naval Medical Center San Diego started a multidisciplinary shared medical appointment for patients with complicated cases of heart failure. Patients enrolled in the heart failure clinic were monitored prospectively for 6 months. Validated questionnaires concerning satisfaction with care, self-care management, depression, and quality-of-life measures were administered at baseline and 6 months after enrollment. Thirty-nine individuals were enrolled in the clinic, with 33 completing 6 months of follow-up monitoring to date. Hospital admissions for any cause decreased from 11 to eight, whereas congestive heart failure-related admissions decreased from four to two. There was a total of six deaths. During the 6 months of enrollment, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-receptor blockers had absolute increases of 20% and 19%, respectively. Statistically significant improvements were seen in the Beck Depression Inventory and Self-Care Management Index results. A multidisciplinary approach to heart failure patients using the shared medical appointment model can improve patient satisfaction, enhance quality of life, and help reduce hospitalizations while improving provider efficiency.", 
    "875": "This review is aimed at examining calcium channel blocker (CCB)-related oedema and how this can be attenuated through the use of agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. CCBs are effective antihypertensive agents, but their propensity for causing oedema may reduce compliance. A review of the literature has indicated that the absolute incidence of this side effect is difficult to determine because reported rates vary widely, a factor that may stem from differences in the surveillance technique (active vs passive). In a recent trial incorporating active surveillance, 25% of patients who received amlodipine 10 mg per day experienced oedema. CCB-induced oedema is caused by increased capillary hydrostatic pressure that results from preferential dilation of pre-capillary vessels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) cause post-capillary dilation and normalize hydrostatic pressure, and are thus ideally suited for prevention/reversal of CCB-induced oedema. The efficacy of this strategy was proven using both subjective and objective techniques. ARB/CCB and ACEI/CCB combination therapy is also more effective than CCB monotherapy in controlling blood pressure. These combinations represent an important advance in the management of hypertension.",

    "878": "The direct cardiac actions of PA12 and its role as a substrate for chymase-dependent AngII generation were investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats using an isolated heart model of cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion injury. PA12 potently constricted coronary arteries with no significant effect on left-ventricular contractility. PA12 impaired recovery from global ischaemia, maintaining coronary constriction and markedly increasing release of creatine kinase and troponin I (TnI), indicating greater myocardial injury. Analysis of perfusate collected after transcardiac passage revealed a marked increase in AngII production from hearts infused with PA12. Cardiac AngII production was not blocked by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, whereas inhibition of chymase with chymostatin significantly reduced AngII production and attenuated PA12-induced vasoconstriction and myocardial damage following ischaemia. Furthermore, Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) blockade abolished PA12 activity. In vitro, PA12 was efficiently and precisely converted to AngII as assessed on reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This conversion was blocked by chymostatin.",

In particular, the accumulation of Abeta42 is the central event triggering neurodegeneration. Reduction of Abeta is now a major therapeutic strategy. However, only a few patients show evidence of increased Abeta production. Thus, defects in proteases that degrade Abeta could underlie some or many cases of familial and sporadic AD. Among the Abeta degrading enzymes, namely, neprilysin (NEP), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE is the most commonly targeted enzyme by inhibitors in elderly populations because it plays a central role in the regulation of blood pressure and hypertension.

Insulin resistance, decreased insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose output are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, and each class of medication targets one or more of these defects. Metformin, which decreases hepatic glucose output and sensitizes peripheral tissues to insulin, has been shown to decrease mortality rates in patients with type 2 diabetes and is considered a first-line agent. Other medications include sulfonylureas and nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones. Insulin can be used acutely in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to normalize blood glucose, or it can be added to a regimen of oral medication to improve glycemic control.

Relative to baseline, all avosentan dosages decreased mean relative UAER (-16.3 to -29.9%) compared with placebo (35.5%). Median relative UAER decreased with all avosentan dosages (-28.7 to -44.8%) compared with placebo (12.1%). Creatinine clearance and BP were unchanged at 12 wk. The main adverse events were peripheral edema (12%), mainly with high (>/=25 mg) dosages of avosentan; significant increases in liver enzymes did not occur.

Distal convoluted tubule Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC) is regulated by trafficking between the apical plasma membrane (APM) and subapical cytoplasmic vesicles (SCV). We aimed to determine whether NCC trafficking contributes to pressure diuresis by decreasing APM NCC or compensates for increased volume flow to the DCT by increasing APM NCC. BP was raised 50 mmHg (high BP) in rats by arterial constriction for 5 or 20-30 min, provoking a 10-fold diuresis at both times. Kidneys were excised, and NCC subcellular distribution was analyzed by 1) sorbitol density gradient fractionation and immunoblotting and 2) immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM). NCC distribution did not change after 5-min high BP. After 20-30 min of high BP, 20% of NCC redistributed from low-density, APM-enriched fractions to higher density, endosome-enriched fractions, and, by quantitative immuno-EM, pool size of APM NCC decreased 14% and SCV pool size increased. Because of the time lag of the response, we tested the hypothesis that internalization of NCC was secondary to the decrease in ANG II that accompanies high BP. Clamping ANG II at a nonpressor level by coinfusion of captopril (12 microg/min) and ANG II (20 ng.kg(-1).min(-1)) during 30-min high BP reduced diuresis to eightfold and prevented redistribution of NCC from APM- to SCV-enriched fractions. We conclude that DCT NCC may participate in pressure natriuresis-diuresis by retraction out of apical plasma membranes and that the retraction is, at least in part, driven by the fall in ANG II that accompanies acute hypertension.",

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been demonstrated to prevent atrial fibrillation and new-onset diabetes, and provide cardiac, cerebral, and renal protection. Combination therapy with ACEIs and ARBs, compared with monotherapy, provides enhanced reno- and cardioprotection, although available data indicate that combination RAS blockade may be beneficial only in select patient groups, such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure (HF). In certain high-risk patients, the use of ARBs provides comparable efficacy to that observed with ACEIs. The efficacy of these agents may stem from pleiotropic effects beyond blood pressure (BP) reduction. Several studies demonstrate achievement of clinical endpoints without significant effects on BP.", 
    "909": "One of the most common complications of Systemic Arterial Hypertension is the hypertensive crisis(1) characterized by a symptomatic elevation of blood pressure (BP) with or without involvement of target organs, which may lead to immediate or potential risk to life. The hypertensive crisis may manifest itself as hypertensive emergency or urgency. In the emergency there is fast deterioration of target organs and immediate risk to life, a situation that does not occur in hypertensive urgency. On the other hand, situations in which the patient presents elevated BP due to an emotionally charged, painful or uncomfortable event, with no evidence of lesion of target organs or immediate risk to life, characterize the hypertensive pseudo-crisis, a condition that does not require the use of emergency antihypertensive therapy. Despite this fact, the practice has become widespread of prescribing antihypertensive medication prior to situations believed to present a risk of abrupt BP elevation, irrespective of the symptoms. This study aims at assessing the frequency of prescription of captopril prior to BP elevation in patients hospitalized in a university hospital. It was also intended to map the places (clinical or surgical wards) where this procedure was more frequent.",

    "924": "During major vascular surgery (MVS), patients are at high risk for developing unrecognized myocardial infarction (MI) and myocardial ischemia. In reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality, preoperative cardiac risk stratification and adequate medical therapy play a pivotal role. Based on literature and current opinions, medical treatment should comprise at least a combination of beta-blockers, aspirin, and statins. beta-Blockers exert their beneficial effects predominantly through heart rate control, leading to reduced oxygen demand during surgery. A heart rate between 65 and 70 bpm should be achieved. Irrespective of their lipid-lowering effects, statins seem to improve postoperative cardiac outcome by stabilizing coronary artery plaques, thereby preventing atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Aspirin reduces platelet activation and vasoconstriction, thereby limiting ischemic events and reducing nonfatal MI by 34%. Adding clopidogrel to low-dose aspirin might be beneficial toward postoperative cardiac outcomes; however, the effect on the incidence of postoperative bleeding complications may be a problem for future studies to resolve. Whereas beta-blockers inhibit the effect of catecholamines, alpha(2)-agonists inhibit catecholamine release and may be used in the perioperative setting when beta-blockers are contraindicated. Despite the blood pressure-lowering effect and anti-inflammatory properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the literature does not support their use in patients undergoing MVS. The possible use of calcium antagonists before MVS should be further evaluated in high-risk patients with contraindications to beta-blockers, such as asthma, conduction abnormalities, or a history of stroke. Although nitrates are widely used for treating angina pectoris, the beneficial effect of their use in patients undergoing MVS remains controversial. Therefore, nitrates are not routinely used in the perioperative setting. The current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines do not recommend prophylactic coronary revascularization before noncardiac surgery in patients with stable coronary artery disease.",

This study is a prospective, randomized, open-label study with blinded assessment of endpoints to compare the 2-year effect of strict treatment to maintain systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg with that of mild treatment to maintain systolic blood pressure below 160 but at or above 140 mmHg in elderly hypertensive patients. Patients with essential hypertension (65-85 years old, with a pretreatment systolic blood pressure of above 160 mmHg) were randomly assigned to receive strict treatment (n=2,212) or mild treatment (n=2,206). The baseline drug was efonidipine hydrochloride, a long-acting calcium antagonist. The primary endpoint was the combined incidence of cardiovascular disease and renal failure, and the secondary endpoints were total deaths and any safety problems. Although final blood pressures (systolic/diastolic) were significantly lower in the strict-treatment group compared with the mild-treatment group (135.9/74.8 vs. 145.6/78.1 mmHg; p<0.001), the incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the two groups (86 patients in each group; p=0.99). Total deaths were 54 in the strict-treatment group vs. 42 in the mild-treatment group (p=0.22), and treatment was withdrawn because of adverse events in 36 patients in each group (p=0.99). An interaction between age and treatment for the primary endpoints (p=0.03) was seen. Complex clinical features associated with aging seem to have obscured the difference in effect between the two treatments.

This audit focussed on the use of four guideline-recommended therapies: aspirin +/- clopidogrel, beta blockers, statins and ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I), as well as the utilization of multiple antithrombotics.", 
    "928": "Data pertaining to a total of 169 patients was extracted and reviewed. The mean age of the study population was 65.9 years and 71% of the population was male. Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (Non-STEMI) accounted for 42% of the admissions, whereas 33.7% and 24.3% of the patients were respectively admitted for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or unstable angina. After accounting for reported contra-indications, overall, 96% of the eligible patients received antithrombotics comprising of at least aspirin, and 79% of eligible patients received aspirin plus clopidogrel. Furthermore, 82% of eligible patients received a beta-blocker at discharge, 86% a statin and 79% received either an ACE-I or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist. Compared with patients who presented with myocardial infarction (with or without ST-segment elevation), those presenting with unstable angina were less likely to receive a beta-blocker (OR = 0.19, 95%-CI: 0.08-0.48) or an ACE-agent (OR = 0.15, 95%-CI: 0.06-0.39) at discharge.

    "930": "Intervention in the RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) is one of the leading pharmacotherapeutic strategies, among others, used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease to improve the prognosis after myocardial infarction and to reduce hypertension. Recently, regenerative progenitor cell therapy has emerged as a possible alternative for pharmacotherapy in patients after myocardial infarction or ischaemic events elsewhere, e.g. in the limbs. Angiogenic cell therapy to restore the vascular bed in ischaemic tissues is currently being tested in a multitude of clinical studies. This has prompted researchers to investigate the effect of modulation of the RAAS on progenitor cells. Furthermore, the relationship between hypertension and endothelial progenitor cell function is being studied. Pharmacotherapy by means of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has varying effects on progenitor cell levels and function. These controversial effects may be explained by involvement of multiple mediators, e.g. angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7), that have differential effects on mesenchymal stem cells, haematopoietic progenitor cells and endothelial progenitor cells. Importantly, angiotensin II can either stimulate endothelial progenitor cells by improvement of vascular endothelial growth factor signalling, or invoke excessive production of reactive oxygen species causing premature senescence of these cells. On the other hand, angiotensin-(1-7) stimulates haematopoietic cells and possibly also endothelial progenitor cells. Furthermore, aldosterone, bradykinin and Ac-SDKP (N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro) may also affect progenitor cell populations. Alternatively, the variability in effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on cardiovascular progenitor cells might reflect differences between the various models or diseases with respect to circulating and local tissue RAAS activation. In the present review we discuss what is currently known with respect to the role of the RAAS in the regulation of cardiovascular progenitor cells.",

In this paper the stability properties of molecule xPRIL were studied by determination of degradation path and rate of degradation in aqueous solutions with different pH (2.0, 6.8 and 12.0) and temperatures (40, 60 and 80 degrees C). The degradation of molecule through two main degradation paths was identified and confirmed by liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Stability properties of xPRIL were determined in a stability study evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The first order kinetics of degradation reaction of xPRIL and Arrhenius equations for each pH were determined at observed conditions. xPRIL showed the highest stability at pH 2 solution. The degradation kinetics of xPRIL was compared to the degradation kinetics of enalapril maleate (EM) and perindopril (PER) in bio relevant solutions with pH 2.0 and 6.8. In addition to the stability study of xPRIL the forced degradation study of all three molecules at rigorous conditions was conducted. From the obtained results the structural element having the highest influence on stability properties of the studied molecules was identified. The fragmentation paths of xPRIL, its cyclization degradation product and its hydrolysis degradation product were identified and confirmed by MS/MS method.",

Drugs that have been developed for vascular diseases and/or found to have beneficial endothelial effects may be helpful in the management of ED. In this manuscript we summarize the current state of the art with respect to endothelial active drugs and discuss the evidence supporting their use in the management of ED. Pubmed query for the terms Endothelial dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, pharmaceuticals, \"endothelium\", \"function\", \"pharmaceutical\", \"eNOS\", \"erectile dysfunction\" and \"erectile function\" was conducted. Relevant articles were reviewed and summarized. A variety of cardiovascular medications have mechanisms of action that involve the endothelium. Examples include HMG-CoA Reductase inhibitors (\"statins\"), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI), Angiotensin Receptor blockers (ARB), Endothelin Receptor Antagonists (ERA), certain beta blockers, and some oral hypoglycemics. Some of these drugs have been found to improve penile erection, although an endothelium dependent mechanism has not been conclusively demonstrated in all studies. Drugs that improve endothelial function in the cavernous arteries and the erectile tissues of the corpora cavernosa hold great promise in treating or at least minimizing the vascular damage that contributes to ED. ACEI and ARB appear to hold great promise in this regard, while statins and oral hypoglycemics may play a potentially useful role as adjunctive therapy for ED. Improvements in endothelial function may help reverse ED in some cases, which would be a marked improvement over management with currently available \"on demand\" ED therapies.",

Antidepressants have a significant impact on endothelial function. In addition, several drugs used to treat vascular disease or vascular risk factors, such as calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins, have, to variable extents, significant clinical effects on depressive symptomatology or amyloid deposition in AD. Furthermore, preclinical and clinical data suggest that the nitric oxide and VEGF signaling pathways may be of value for the treatment of depression and AD.",

Nitric oxide and angiotensin II affect mesangial cell proliferation. However, an association between nitric oxide synthase or angiotensin II on GAS-6 expression in the kidney has not previously been examined. Thus, our aim was to examine the effects of antihypertensive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and chronic nitric oxide synthase inhibition on the kidney expression of GAS-6 and its receptors AXL, MER and RSE.",

At the end of the study, kidneys were placed in fixative and processed to paraffin for immunohistochemical staining.",

Positive GAS-6 staining was detectable only in those mice receiving some form of chronic dosing with captopril, whether they were treated with captopril only or with captopril and L-NAME. Immunohistochemical detection across cases for MER and RSE was rare, whereas AXL-positive staining in the kidney mirrored GAS-6 staining/expression. The staining of GAS6 and AXL was predominantly localised to the renal tubular cells.",

    "966": "Over recent years antihypertensive drugs, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been reported to have beneficial effects upon cognitive impairment. Such findings suggest that pharmacological manipulation of angiotensin ligands may be of clinical importance in slowing or halting the cognitive deterioration seen in vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism(s) underlying these improvements in cognitive function remains unclear; however, important leads are emerging. The angiotensin AT4 receptor subtype, discovered by our laboratory in 1992, influences several important behaviours and physiologies, including learning and memory, and may play a role in this cognitive improvement. This review initially describes the therapeutic drugs approved by the Federal Drug Administration and new approaches presently being developed to treat Alzheimer's disease-induced cognitive impairment. Next, the biologically-active angiotensin ligands and their respective receptor subtypes are discussed, followed by the roles of angiotensin II, angiotensin IV, ACE inhibitors and ARBs in cognitive function. We conclude with a working hypothesis concerning the importance of the AT4 receptor subtype as a new potential drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease-associated memory loss.",

    "971": "Tablets are one of the most popular and preferred solid dosage forms because they can be accurately dosed, easily manufactured and packaged on a large scale, have good physical and chemical stability, and can contribute to good patient compliance given their ease of administration. The ability to match doses to patients depends on the availability of multiple dose sizes and adequate dose-response information. These are not always provided, so splitting of the tablets is sometimes necessary. Tablet splitting is an accepted practice in dispensing medication. It has been used when a dosage form of the required strength is not available commercially. The aim of our study was to compare some physical parameters of whole and scored lisinopril and lisinopril/hydrochlorthiazide tablets and to accept or exclude their influence on the obtaining of required dosage. According to the results obtained, we may conclude that tablets from batch \"I\", \"II\", \"III\" and \"IV\" satisfied pharmacopeial requirements concerning crushing strength, friability, disintegration time and mass uniformity. The hardness testing showed acceptable reproducibility and indicate that the data variation was primarily from the irreversible changes in the structure of tablet samples. The act of compacting powders stores energy within the tablets, by shifting or compressing the intermolecular bonds within the particles. The tablets have a natural tendency to relax once pressure is removed, and this tendency works against the interparticle bonding formed during compression. Hardness testing procedure causes irreversible changes in this structure.",

Over the 7-year period from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2006, the mean ([SD] median) pharmacy reimbursement was $8.44 ([$5.19] $7.00) per MTM service, and the mean ([SD] median) ECA was $93.78 ([$1,022.23] $5.00). During the 7-year period, pharmacist provided MTM interventions changed from primarily education and monitoring for new or changed prescription therapies to prescriber consultations regarding cost-efficacy management (Pearson chi-square P<0.001). Services also shifted from claims involving acute medications (e.g. penicillin antibiotics, macrolide antibiotics, and narcotic analgesics) to services involving chronic medications (e.g., lipid lowering agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, and beta-blockers; P<0.001), resulting in significant changes in the therapeutic classes associated with MTM claims and an increase in the proportion of older patients served (P<0.001).

The severity of kidney disease is associated with graded increases in risk for CVD and death. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be recognized and treatment initiated early to maximize the chances for slowing nephropathy progression and reducing proteinuria. We recommend screening for CKD in all patients with CVD, including computing an estimated GFR and evaluating for proteinuria using a spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio. Aggressive management of traditional cardiovascular risk factors should be employed in this high-risk population, specifically rigorous hypertension control (including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocking agents (ARB)), management of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and smoking cessation.

Today, it should be a major task of the clinical pharmacologist in academia to provide support in the interpretation of preclinical and clinical study data, to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines and to serve as drug expert supporting all disciplines of clinical medicine with specific pharmacological and therapeutic knowledge. The results of the ONTARGET-trial confront both researchers and clinicians with the unexpected truth that AT(1)-receptor-blockade with an angiotensin-receptor-blocker (ARB) does not seem to have superior therapeutic benefit compared with an ACE-inhibitor (ACE-I) at reducing fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. The combination of the two drugs was associated with more adverse events without an increase in benefit. Therefore, the crucial question 'ACE-I, ARB, or both?' requires a new and critical appraisal depending on the medical indication for which these renin-angiotensin-system (RAS)-inhibitors are used: In a population of high-risk patients suffering from cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, the evidence to favor an ARB over an ACE-I is still limited after ONTARGET and because of the higher costs for ARBs one can rather support the old therapeutic advice that ARBs are equally effective as ACE-Is and therefore therapeutic alternatives for patients with ACE-I intolerance. With respect to a very moderate additive BP-lowering effect of dual therapy with an ACE-I and an ARB seen in metaanalysis which was not even clearly attributable to dual RAS-inhibition and the increased adverse event rate in the combination treatment group of ONTARGET, this regimen seems not to be recommendable for the treatment of hypertension. Dual-RAS-blockade using an ACE-I-ARB-combination is an effective therapy to treat proteinuria and might be of therapeutic benefit especially in diabetic patients without concomitant diseases. There may be a therapeutic rationale to prefer ARBs over ACE-Is in well-selected patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) because a considerable amount of angiotensin II (Ang II) is produced independent of angiotensin-conversion-enzyme (ACE) in the failing heart and is therapeutically unaffected by ACE-I treatment. The results of the Val-HeFt and the CHARM-added-study revealed additive effects of an ARB on heart failure related morbidity and mortality when added to existing therapy with an ACE-I suggesting a role for ACE-I-ARB-combination treatment in well selected heart failure patients. Independent of the medical indication for its use, the concept of dual RAS-blockade with an ARB-ACE-I-combination should clinically be used with caution and a close monitoring of potassium levels and kidney function. Although the results of ONTARGET revealed equity of ramipril and telmisartan at reducing fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, we should not forget that pharmacologically not all ARBs are the same and the question if the study results of ONTARGET with telmisartan are transferable to the complete class of ARBs still merits further investigation.", 
    "983": "Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is one of the most frequent arrhythmias, especially in elderly patients. Cardiac overload increases the incidence of AF. Clinical presentation of atrial fibrillation can occur as nonsustained paroxysms, persistent episodes and in chronic-permanent form. The physio-pathological mechanisms are: *Circuit of multiple and anarchic re-entries *Atrial fibrillatory conduction *Re-entry circuit with fibrillatory conduction.Remodeling (electrical or structural) facilitates the appearance and persistence of AF: Neurovegetative changes and cytosolic Ca overload facilitate AF. Interstitial atrial fibrosis, in which Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) hyperactivity is a main aspect of remodeling. There is clinical evidence that supports the antiatrial fibrillatory actions of RAS blockade. Potential mechanisms are: (a) direct modulation of ionic channels, (b) hemodynamic improvement, (c) reduction of atrial stretching, (d) antifibrotic effects. There is less clinical evidence with antialdosterone drugs, but theoretically these might also be useful.",

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) has turned out to be beneficial at all stages of this continuum. Several mechanisms govern the progression of structural myocardial damage to end-stage CHF. Chronic neuroendocrine activation fosters left ventricular remodeling and dilatation and leads to clinical symptoms of CHF via forward/backward failure. RAS inhibition is a cornerstone of neuroendocrine blockade in CHF patients, and combined RAS blockade is especially effective in patients presenting with repetitive cardiac decompensations. This review focuses on the therapeutic role of inhibitors of different RAS components in chronic heart failure caused by systolic left ventricular dysfunction.",

Of 1,847 patients admitted from 2002 to 2007 with STEMI, 73 (4%) were >or=85 years old (range 85 to 94). Median time from symptom onset to hospital arrival was 3 hours. Cardiogenic shock occurred in 33%. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 70% of patients, and the procedural success rate was 94%. Evidenced-based therapy included aspirin (97%), clopidogrel (93%), beta blockers (82%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (74%), and statins (86%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 32%, and it was 54% in those with cardiogenic shock. Long-term follow-up was obtained in 96% of hospital survivors at a median of 429 days. Survival rates in patients discharged alive were 75% at 1 year and 65% at 2 years. Cardiogenic shock was the only independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 11.7, p=0.02), and primary PCI was the only independent predictor of long-term survival (hazard ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.8, p=0.02). Mean EQ-5D Index was 0.78 and mean EQ-VAS was 70.5. In conclusion, in the oldest old with STEMI, aggressive treatment is associated with reasonable long-term survival and excellent quality of life.

    "987": "The clinical syndrome of heart failure is associated with both a resting vasoconstriction and reduced sensitivity to nitric oxide mediated vasodilatation, and this review will focus on the role of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase in the pathogenesis of the vascular abnormalities of heart failure. Nitric oxide mediates vasodilatation by an activation of guanylate cyclase and an increase in the production of cGMP, which leads to the activation of the type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKGI). PKGI then activates a number of targets that produce smooth muscle relaxation including MLC phosphatase. MLC phosphatase is a holoenzyme consisting of three subunits; a 20 kD subunit of unknown function, an approximately 38-kD catalytic subunit and a myosin targeting subunit (MYPT1). Alternative splicing of a 31 bp 3 exon generates MYPT1 isoforms, which differ by a COOH-terminus leucine zipper (LZ). Further, PKGI-mediated activation of MLC phosphatase requires the expression of a LZ+ MYPT1. Congestive heart failure is associated with a decrease in LZ+ MYPT1 expression, which results in a decrease in the sensitivity to cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation. Beyond their ability to reduce afterload, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a number of beneficial effects that include maintaining the expression of the LZ+ MYPT1 isoform, thereby conserving normal sensitivity to cGMP-mediated vasodilatation, as well as differentially regulating genes associated with mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling. ACE inhibition reduces circulating angiotensin II and thus limits the downstream activation of MAPK signalling pathways, possibly preventing the alteration of the vascular phenotype to preserve normal vascular function.",

Rats were divided into the following groups: Control (tap water) and N(omega)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 60 mg/kg/day/2 weeks). Dose-response curves to Ang II were constructed in the pithed rat. The results show that Ang II evoked blood pressure increase in pithed rats in a dose-related manner. In L-NAME-treated rats a greater maximal effect was observed, indicating that L-NAME promotes Ang II hypersensitivity. In L-NAME-treated rats, Ang II response was blocked by losartan (1 and 3 mg/kg), a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, indicating that AT1 receptor influence L-NAME hypertensive mechanism.

These drugs, such as omapatrilat, sampatrilat, fasidotrilat, by combined inhibition of ACE and degradation of natriuretic peptides and in turn by inhibiting the Renin - Angiotensin - Aldosterone system and potentiating the Natriuretic Peptide system and Kinin system should decrease the mortality rate in the group of patients with hypertension being not adequately controlled with ACE inhibitors. Thus, finding the new therapeutic strategy using drugs that act on the hormonal systems other than Renin - Angiotensin - Aldosterone system seems to be crucial. The aim of the study was to compare the molecular aspects of the conventional schemes that are being used in the antihypertension therapy to the new drugs from the vasopeptidase inhibitors group--with focusing on the natriuretic peptide system (NPS)--and, taking these considerations, making clues about therapeutical implications to reveal promising results in antihypertension treatment.", 
    "1010": "Among people with diabetes, about 40% of those aged 45 years, and more than 60% of those aged 75 years and over, will have a blood pressure over 140/90\u00a0mmHg. Major cardiac events occur in approximately 5% of people with diabetes and untreated hypertension each year, and the risk is higher in those with other risk factors, such as diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "1011": "We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antihypertensives in people with diabetes and hypertension? What are the effects of different blood pressure targets in people with diabetes and hypertension? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).", 
    "1012": "We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.", 
    "1013": "In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alpha-blockers; angiotensin II receptor antagonists; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; beta-blockers; blood pressure targets (lower or higher); calcium-channel blockers; and diuretics.", 
    "1014": "A 79-year-old woman was out in the garden having lunch on a hot summer day. She developed stabbing chest pains, more severe on her left side, associated with radiation down her left arm. Severity was 7 out of 10. There was no relief of pain with glyceryl trinitrate spray. Risk factors for ischaemic heart disease include hyperlipidaemia, being an ex-smoker (40 years), no history of diabetes or hypertension. There was a family history of her father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 54. Echocardiogram (ECG) revealed widespread deep symmetrical T-wave inversion in the chest leads and lateral limb leads.", 
    "1015": "The patient's serum creatine kinase level was 180 IU/litre (normal range 30-135), troponin I level was 6.56 g/litre (normal range 0-0.10), D-dimer was negative and random serum cholesterol level was 5.3 mmol/litre (3.8-5.2). Significant coronary stenoses were excluded. A left ventriculogram revealed a hyperkinetic base and a dyskinetic apical region of the left ventricle. Echocardiography showed normal valves, basal septal hypertrophy and a dilated akinetic apex, with the region of akinesia spanning more than the arterial territory.",

    "1017": "Treatment with aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, \u03b2 blocker and a statin.", 
    "1018": "Acute kidney injury following acute coronary event can occur from multiple factors, including secondary to volume depletion, poor perfusion because of cardiac dysfunction, secondary to medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers or because of aggressive diuretics or use of contrast agents. Atheroembolism (cholesterol embolisation) often occurs following an intervention, such as angiography or revascularisation procedure. An uncommon presentation of atheroembolic renal disease that likely was precipitated by the use of thrombolytics and/or anticoagulation is discussed.", 
    "1019": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment was started in a 67-year-old woman with arterial hypertension. Two days later she complained of a hoarse, raspy voice and progressive abdominal pain. The laboratory investigation was within normal limits. However, CT scans of the abdomen revealed marked thickening of the proximal jejunum together with substantial fluid accumulation in the abdomen and pelvis. Due to the severity of the symptoms diagnostic laparatomy was considered as a surgical option. Several hours later the patient started to complain about a progressive inspiratory stridor, which resolved after treatment with epinephrine, antihistamines and corticosteroids. ACE inhibitor induced angioedema was suspected and ACE inhibitor treatment was stopped, after which the severe abdominal symptoms also resolved completely. ACE inhibitor induced angioedema is a rare and often unrecognised side effect of ACE inhibitor treatment that physicians need to be aware of in order to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures, including explorative laparatomy.", 
    "1020": "Patients over 10 years of age with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) risk developing significant glomerular proteinuria, a condition called cyanotic nephropathy. Even though the pathogenesis of glomerulopathy associated with CCHD is still unclear, a potential mechanism is hyperviscosity-induced decrease in peritubular capillary blood flow leading to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure, in turn resulting in proteinuria. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been traditionally used in the treatment of these patients with cyanotic nephropathy, they may, however, not be well tolerated. Here we present a case of an adult patient with CCHD who could not tolerate an ACE inhibitor but showed improvement and stabilisation of her renal function following treatment with repeated phlebotomies.", 
    "1021": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a relatively homogenous drug class widely used today. They have been shown to reduce morbidity or mortality in congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Pathologies underlying these conditions are partially attributable to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II contributes to endothelial dysfunction, altered renal hemodynamics, and vascular and cardiac hypertrophy. ACE inhibitors attenuate these effects. Clinical outcomes of ACE inhibition include lower incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, reinfarction, angina, stroke, end-stage renal disease, and morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated and have few contraindications.", 
    "1022": "Hyperforin (HF) is a phloroglucinol compound obtained from St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum). Recent studies have shown that Hyperforin can be used to improve psychopathologic symptoms of Alzheimer's disease but the mechanism is not clear. This may be partly due to the difficult in studying Hyperforin, since this chemical is unstable and is sensitive to light, oxygen, and heat. In this study, we explored the effects of acetylate hyperforin (ace-HF), a stable derivative of hyperforin, on the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1APP695sw and SH-SY5Y cells were treated with ace-HF, followed by measuring the levels of APP and sAPP\u03b1. Twelve hours of treatment led to an increase in extracellular sAPP\u03b1, but APP mRNA and protein levels were unchanged. Further studies with \u03b1-secretase and a pan PKC inhibitor, Calphostin C, indicated that ace-HF's effect on extracellular sAPP\u03b1 was closely related to PKC activities and \u03b1-secretase activities. Our findings suggest that ace-HF can modulate \u03b1-secretase-mediated APP processing via a PKC signaling pathway.", 
    "1023": "Pathological changes in the myocardium in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are usually studied using endomyocardial biopsy specimens, but the relationship between pathological changes in the myocardium and clinical findings is unclear. The goal of the study was to examine correlations between clinical findings and histopathological findings in specimens of the left ventricular myocardium collected during left ventriculoplasty in DCM patients.", 
    "1024": "The subjects were 20 DCM patients (17 males and 3 females; mean age: 59 \u00b1 14 years old) who underwent left ventriculoplasty, including 16 cases of overlapping ventriculoplasty (OLVP) and 4 of papillary muscle approximation (PMA) with left ventricular incision. Preoperative age, sex, The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), echocardiographic data, history of diabetes mellitus, drug history of spironolactone, ACE inhibitor, ARB, and \u03b2-blocker were used as clinical findings. Histopathological scores were determined for each patient and semi-quantitative data for hypertrophy, attenuation, vacuolation and fibrosis were obtained.", 
    "1025": "A significant correlation was found between age and interstitial fibrosis. A significant inverse correlation was found between left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDd) in echocardiographic data and interstitial fibrosis. There were no other significant relation between histopathological scores and clinical findings.", 
    "1026": "From this study, we found that interstitial fibrous increased with aging and more dilated LVDd had less interstitial fibrosis. It is concluded that the kinetics of myocardial fibrosis with remodeling might be variable and histopathological findings does not reflect the clinical and hemodynamic changes in DCM patients. Further morphological data are needed to verify this result."
