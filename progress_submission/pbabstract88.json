    "0": "The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endothelin, a newly discovered very potent vasoconstrictor secreted by endothelial cells, on the coronary vascular bed. For this purpose, the effects of endothelin injected intracoronarily were tested in open-chest anesthetized dogs with the circumflex coronary artery cannulated and perfused at a constant pressure of 100 mm Hg. Circumflex blood flow, transmural distribution of coronary blood flow (radioactive microspheres), circumflex coronary artery diameter (piezoelectric crystals), and circumflex luminal surface area were measured. Endothelin decreased coronary blood flow by 30% and 61% with doses of 1 and 3 micrograms, respectively. A dose of 10 micrograms was lethal. The decrease of coronary blood flow was larger in the subepicardium than in the subendocardium, which explains that the endocardial-epicardial blood flow ratio increased from 1.27 +/- 0.05 to 1.98 +/- 0.23 (p less than 0.001) with a dose of 3 micrograms endothelin. Circumflex surface area decreased by 7% (p = NS) and 20% (p less than 0.01) with doses of 1 and 3 micrograms endothelin, respectively. The action of endothelin was not modified by the concomitant alpha-adrenergic blockade, serotonergic blockade, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, or cyclooxygenase inhibition. We conclude that endothelin is a potent coronary vasoconstrictor with a selective effect on the subepicardium. At least part of the increase of coronary vascular resistance is due to a constriction of the large coronary arteries. Further studies are required to determine the physiopathological role of endothelin, especially in coronary vasospasm.", 
    "1": "Preclinical development of an intravenous dosage form for the ACE inhibitor RS-10029 involved the formulation and characterization of the drug's chemical/physical stability in two prototype formulations (injectable solution and lyophilized powder). Included in these studies were quantitative evaluations of various processing and administration parameters (membrane qualification, terminal sterilization, compatibility/delivery of the drug with typical infusion fluids and administration sets) on finished product integrity and quality. Analytical methodology used in these studies consisted primarily of a stability specific HPLC assay and a light obscuration based sensor (HIAC) for particulate matter analysis. Results of these studies indicate that the drug is relatively stable at ambient temperature and under accelerated storage conditions (predicted T90 at 25 degrees C greater than 2 yr, and T90 at 50 degrees C greater than 2 mo). However, the ability of the product to withstand a full terminal sterilization cycle is limited, and therefore other approaches toward sterile processing were examined. With regard to the stability and compatibility of the drug in a variety of fluids and devices there appears to be no overt limitations in its use for either bolus or infusion delivery.", 
    "2": "Because of the limited stability of moexipril (RS-10085; 1) in aqueous solution, lyophilized parenteral formulations were evaluated as a function of pH in this study. In general, the lyophilized powder of 1 showed about two orders of magnitude less reactivity at 50 degree C than in aqueous solution at pH values below 3 or above 6. At pH 5.1, however, the lyophilized powder had maximum reactivity, with the rate actually comparable to that observed in aqueous solution. When the distribution of the two major products, diketopiperazine (DKP) 2 and ester hydrolysis analogue 3, was compared to the observed kinetics as a function of pH, it was clear that removal of water via lyophilization suppressed the spontaneous k1 cyclization process, the spontaneous k3 hydrolysis process, and the specific base-catalyzed k4 hydrolysis process. The overall spontaneous k2 cyclization process, however, was not affected by lyophilization. The latter result is accounted for by the increased equilibrium constant for the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate, To, as a result of lyophilization. This study demonstrates that stability data in solution can not be used for predicting the stability of moexipril in lyophilized powder form.", 
    "3": "The influence of changing baseline blood pressure by various means, both related or unrelated to the renin-angiotensin system, on the pressor responses to spinal cord stimulation has been examined in the pithed rat. Mean arterial pressure and neurogenic vasoconstriction were higher in pithed rats with intact kidneys (2-kidney rats) than in nephrectomized pithed rats. Increasing blood pressure by infusion of vasopressin increased the pressor response to nerve stimulation in both 2-kidney and nephrectomized pithed rats. Decreasing blood pressure produced by administration of enalaprilat or hydralazine in 2-kidney pithed rats or by administration of hydralazine in nephrectomized pithed rats, decreased the pressor responses to nerve stimulation. Our results showed a positive correlation between the mean arterial blood pressure and the response to nerve stimulation in pithed rats. Therefore, we conclude that the pithed rat is an animal model which should be used with caution to study the interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and drugs which change baseline blood pressure.",

In rats, a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg 14C-CGS 16617 afforded peak plasma concentrations of drug between 0.5 and 6 hr of dosing. The AUC was on average 9.6% of that after iv administration of the same dose, indicating low oral absorption of the drug. The apparent volumes of distribution, V1 and Vdss, were 0.45 and 2.5 liters/kg, respectively. Disappearance of the drug from plasma after the iv dose was biphasic, with mean half-lives of 0.5 and 13 hr, respectively, for the lambda 1 and lambda 2 phases. After single iv doses (10 mg/kg) to dogs and rats, 14CGS 16617 was almost exclusively eliminated by the renal route, with urinary recoveries of greater than 90% of dose. The same dose administered orally gave urinary recoveries of less than 10% of the dose in rats and about 15% in the dog. The remainder of the dose was eliminated in the feces. Bile duct-cannulated rats excreted less than 3% of an oral 10 mg/kg dose in the bile, in 24 hr. In man (N = 4), a single oral dose of 100 mg 14C-CGS 16617 resulted in peak plasma concentrations of 0.02-0.07 microgram of drug eq/ml between 4 and 6 hr of dosing. The mean terminal half-life was estimated at 81 hr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "In a multicentre open trial involving 229 investigators, cicletanine, a new antihypertensive agent, was administered orally in doses of 50 to 100 mg/day either alone (1,238 patients) or combined with another drug (430 patients). In this second group of patients with essential hypertension whose BP had not been normalized by a beta-blocker (n = 157), a calcium inhibitor (n = 67), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 134) or an alpha-blocker (n = 7), cicletanine normalized BP (less than 160/95 mmHg) in 48.8% of the patients and significantly lowered BP values which fell from 177.7 +/- 15.9/103.3 +/- 6.3 mmHg to 157.2 +/- 17.6/88.8 +/- 8.7 mmHg. The addition of cicletanine to treatments with beta-blockers, calcium inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors normalized BP in 48%, 52% and 47% of patients respectively. A significant reduction of symptoms was noted, notably as regards headache, dizziness, palpitations, lower limb oedema, asthenia, auditory disorders and dyspnoea. The side-effects reported (headache, dizziness, gastralgia, nausea, pruritus) were minor and non-specific; they accounted for the withdrawal of only 8 patients. The only significant, though moderate, biochemical variations observed were decreases in natremia and cholesterolaemia unconfirmed by qualitative analysis. Altogether, cicletanine proved to be effective and well tolerated when administered in combination with other antihypertensive drugs belonging to three main therapeutic classes.", 
    "6": "Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are cardiovascular risk factors that commonly coexist. Studies have indicated that it is important to control both risk factors to achieve significant reductions in morbidity and mortality. Recent debate has focused upon whether traditional step I antihypertensive agents can substantially lower these risks because of their effects on plasma lipids. This debate continues to be unresolved. However, for the patient with elevated lipid levels, diuretics and beta-blockers may make the management of the lipid disorder more difficult. Therefore it may be desirable to select alternative step I antihypertensive agents that will not interfere with the therapy for hyperlipidemia. Alternative step I agents include alpha 1-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. These agents either have no effect on plasma lipids or they improve the lipid profile. Generally, these drugs are well tolerated and provide good alternatives for patients with hyperlipidemias. The initial drug of choice can be chosen depending upon other patient variables such as age, race, or concomitant diseases.", 
    "7": "High dietary protein intake directly stimulates albumin synthesis ald albuminuria in rats with Heymann nephritis. Increased albumin synthetic rate might be due to the presence of increased amino acids available for protein synthesis causing more efficient translation of preformed albumin mRNA, or instead might be linked to increased steady state albumin mRNA levels in the liver. Albumin synthesis, hepatic albumin mRNA content, and albumin mRNA relative to beta actin mRNA (as an internal control) (Alb/beta Act), were measured in rats with Heymann nephritis fed either 8.5% protein (LP), or after protein intake was increased to 40% for 4 days (HP). enalapril (E) was used to modulate the proteinuric effect of HP, yielding four experimental groups, LPN (8.5% protein nephrotic, no enalapril), LPE (8.5% protein, enalapril treated), HPN (40% protein nephrotic, no enalapril), and HPE (40% protein, enalapril treated). Dietary protein augmentation increased the rate of albumin synthesis, steady-state albumin mRNA levels, and Alb/beta Act in both HPN and HPE, compared to either LPH or LPE, even though serum albumin concentration was greater in HPE than in either of the groups fed LP. Both albumin mRNA and Alb/beta Act correlated with the rate of albumin synthesis (r = 0.531, P less than 0.05; and 0.553, P less than 0.01 respectively). Nuclear run-on assays were performed using nuclei isolated from the livers of LPN or HPN to determine whether increased albumin mRNA resulted from an increase in the rate of albumin mRNA transcription.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "The effect of diets containing 8.5%, 21% or 40% protein on growth, urinary albumin excretion and serum albumin concentration was determined in rats with Heymann nephritis and in non-nephrotic control animals. Urinary albumin excretion was greater in nephrotic rats with each increment in dietary protein intake, and serum albumin concentration tended to be least in nephrotic rats fed 40% protein. Albuminuria decreased spontaneously and serum albumin concentration increased in nephrotic rats fed 8.5% protein for 25 days. Enalapril treatment caused a further reduction in urinary albumin excretion and an increase in serum albumin concentration in nephrotic rats fed 8.5% protein. Albuminuria did not decrease nor did serum albumin concentration increase in nephrotic rats fed 40% protein without enalapril treatment, but enalapril caused a significant reduction in urinary albumin excretion and an increase in serum albumin concentration in nephrotic rats fed either 8.5% or 40% protein. The rate of growth in normal rats was greatest when they were fed 21% protein, compared to either 8.5% or 40% protein. Growth rate was significantly reduced in nephrotic rats, regardless of dietary protein intake and regardless of treatment with enalapril, but the 21% protein diet still induced the most rapid rate of growth. Growth rate was not significantly different in nephrotic rats fed either 40% or 8.5% protein. The difference in weight between pair fed nephrotic and control animals fed 21% protein was due to a decrease in carcass and skin weight in nephrotic animals. Carcass protein was significantly reduced in the nephrotic animals, and carcass saponafiable fat tended to be reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Various pathogenetic mechanisms are involved in IgA nephritis: immunological; platelet, coagulation and vascular injury; mesangial cell proliferation and contractility; hypertension; glomerular hyperperfusion and tubulo-interstitial injury. It is now possible to identify the subgroup of patients with IgA nephritis who have adverse prognostic features and may develop progressive glomerular scarring with renal failure. These features are proteinuria greater than 1 gm/day, non-selective proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, hypertension, crescents and medial hyperplasia of blood vessels on renal biopsy. Controlled trials involving cyclophosphamide, anti-platelet agent (dipyridamole) and low dose warfarin; prednisolone; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and eicosapentanoic acid (fish oil) appear promising. Currently, patients with bad prognostic indices in the Department are offered entry into an ongoing controlled trial of dipyridamole and low dose (anti-thrombotic dose) warfarin. Those patients with nephrotic syndrome especially with selective proteinuria are treated with a course of prednisolone and failing that, cyclophosphamide. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure control among hypertensive patients as uncontrolled hypertension can lead to accelerated renal failure. With the onset of even mild renal impairment, dietary protein restriction should be recommended as this will help to decrease the rate of renal deterioration due to glomerular hyperfusion.", 
    "10": "A group of 22 men with essential hypertension stage I and II according to WHO, mean age 29.1 +/- 1.4 years, was divided at random into two sub-groups. Eleven patients were treated for four weeks with enalapril (E), 10 mg/day, 11 patients were given placebo (P), also for a period of four weeks. The patients were subjected to echocardiographic examination before and after four-week therapy with enalapril or placebo. In patients treated with E a significant reduction of the left ventricular wall and the interventricular septum was observed. There was also a highly significant decline of the weight of the left ventricle and the index of left ventricular mass. Enalapril led to a decline of the specific binding capacity and affinity of beta 2-adrenergic lymphocyte receptors. In the group given P no differences were found during the examination repeated after four weeks. By means of multidimensional linear regression estimates a close relationship was revealed between the difference in the weight of the left ventricle, the difference of the index of left ventricular mass and the difference of specific binding capacity and affinity of beta 2-adrenergic lymphocyte receptors.", 
    "11": "A group of patients with essential hypertension and healthy subjects from the same work place were investigated for a period of four weeks and were subjected, in addition to a basic clinical medical examination, to an ergometric examination ECHO cardiography, occlusion plethysmography, and concurrently serum levels of adrenaline (A), noradrenaline (NA), renin, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) beta receptors before and after four weeks treatment with enalapril were assessed. The results are consistent with available data from the literature where administration of inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) caused a reduction of the peripheral vascular resistance and increased blood flow assessed by means of occlusion plethysmography. Similar results were recorded after captopril administration for a one year period, as reported by Agabiti-Rose (1). Statistically significant differences were detected between hypertonics given placebo and those given enalapril for four weeks, as regards blood flow at rest and peripheral vascular resistance at rest. There was also a significant difference when hypertonic and normotonic subjects were compared. The results are presented in tables and figures.", 
    "12": "Although indicated by several experimental studies, the presence of a renin-angiotensin system has not been demonstrated in the human heart. The influence of a local renin-angiotensin system on the coronary vessels may be difficult to establish after oral or intravenous administration of an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor, since coronary blood flow depends greatly on the loading conditions of the left ventricle. To avoid such a situation, our study consisted in a direct bilateral intracoronary infusion of enalaprilat in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and normal coronary arteries (mean ejection fraction = 32 +/- 11%, n = 12). This intracoronary infusion (0.05 mg min-1, 1 ml min-1 in each coronary artery) resulted in no significant change of the systemic resistances (20.6 +/- 5.6 to 22.0 +/- 5.1 mmHg l-1 min), rate-pressure product (10,974 +/- 2630 to 10,214 +/- 2486) or myocardial oxygen consumption (21.08 +/- 6.37 to 22.10 +/- 6.42 ml min-1). Despite these steady haemodynamic conditions, intracoronary enalaprilat provoked a significant elevation of coronary sinus blood flow (181 +/- 73 to 214 +/- 79 ml min-1, P less than 0.001) with a reduction of coronary resistance (0.51 +/- 0.17 to 0.41 +/- 0.15 mmHg ml-1 min, P less than 0.001), and no significant alteration in plasma renin activity or plasma aldosterone. The results of this intracoronary infusion of enalaprilat demonstrate that this angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor has significant coronary vasodilator properties, which can be evidenced without stimulating the peripheral renin-angiotensin system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril was assessed in Munich-Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis. Rats were given a single dose of adriamycin and one month later divided into four groups matched for albuminuria, blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentration. Groups 1 and 3 remained untreated while groups 2 and 4 received enalapril. Groups 1 and 2 underwent micropuncture studies after 10 days. These short-term studies showed that enalapril reduced arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, group 2 vs. 1, P less than 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) without reducing albuminuria (617 +/- 50 vs. 570 +/- 47 mg/day) or GFR (1.03 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.11 ml/min). Groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of enalapril on progression of renal injury in adriamycin nephrosis. Chronic enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing albuminuria in group 4. Untreated group 3 rats exhibited a progressive reduction in GFR (0.35 +/- 0.08 ml/min at 4 months, 0.27 +/- 0.07 ml/min at 6 months). Enalapril treatment blunted but did not prevent reduction in GFR in group 4 (0.86 +/- 0.15 ml/min at 4 months, 0.69 +/- 0.13 ml/min at 6 months, both P less than 0.05 vs. group 3).

    "14": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on exercise-induced changes in blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated in 15 patients in the early stages of systemic hypertension. Multistage treadmill exercise was performed before and after eight weeks of enalapril administration, and the results of the two trials were compared. In patients at rest, enalapril decreased systolic blood pressure from 172 +/- 18 to 147 +/- 14 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure from 99 +/- 9 to 88 +/- 8 mmHg (both P less than 0.001). In patients at peak exercise, enalapril decreased systolic blood pressure from 216 +/- 13 to 195 +/- 18 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure from 106 +/- 12 to 99 +/- 12 mmHg (both P less than 0.001). There was also a significant decrease in blood pressure during the recovery period after treadmill exercise. Enalapril reduced heart rate at peak exercise (P less than 0.05), but not at rest or during recovery. Thus enalapril alleviated the response of blood pressure to exercise in hypertensive patients and may help prevent hypertensive complications during daily activities.", 
    "15": "In this multicentre controlled single blind trial the effectiveness and safety of cicletanine (100 mg/day) were compared with those of enalapril (20 mg/day) and of the combination of both drugs in the same doses in 72 patients (41 men, 31 women, mean age 64.1 +/- 8.3 years) with permanent moderate essential hypertension without severe cardiovascular complications. In the course of the trial, one patient in each of the three therapeutic groups was excluded either for insufficient effectiveness in monotherapy or for photosensitization under the combined treatment. After two months of treatment, the fall in blood pressure and the number of patients with normalized BP were similar in the groups treated with cicletanine or enalapril alone. In contrast, the cicletanine-enalapril combination produced a significantly greater fall of diastolic arterial pressure than cicletanine alone. In addition, there was a greater reduction of functional symptoms associated with arterial hypertension. Apart from the lone case of photosensitization observed with the combined treatment, only minor side-effects were encountered, including an episode of diarrhoea and a case of extrasystoles with the combination, and a case or nausea with lipothymia under cicletanine alone. There were no significant variations of biochemical values.", 
    "16": "The known physiological adaptation of cardiovascular sensitivity to variations in angiotensin II (Ang II) levels would predict that the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of Ang II inhibition might be at least partly counterbalanced by enhanced Ang II reactivity. Therefore, factors other than Ang II inhibition per se may contribute to the antihypertensive mechanisms of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In order to further investigate this, the body sodium-blood volume state as well as the pressor reactivity to infused Ang II or norepinephrine (NE) were assessed in 12 normal subjects and 16 patients with essential hypertension given a placebo, and after 6 weeks of intervention with enalapril (20-40 mg/day). Enalapril produced in both groups similar falls in plasma ACE activity (P less than 0.0001) and upright plasma aldosterone (P less than 0.01), and a rise in plasma renin activity (PRA; P less than 0.05). BP decreased from 156/107 +/- 3/2 (mean +/- s.e.m.) to 142/94 +/- 5/3 mmHg (P less than 0.001) in the hypertensives and from 118/84 +/- 4/2 to 111/73 +/- 4/3 mmHg (P less than 0.01) in the normal subjects. In the hypertensive patients only, the Ang II pressor reactivity relative to Ang II plasma levels during Ang II infusion was increased (P less than 0.01), while the NE pressor reactivity relative to NE plasma levels during NE infusion (P less than 0.01) as well as the exchangeable body sodium (-5%, P less than 0.001) were reduced significantly. Blood and plasma volume, levels of plasma atrial natriuretic factor and catecholamines, and the heart rate and its response to isoproterenol were unchanged in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "The effects of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril (5 mg p.o.) and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (2 mg p.o.) were investigated on the dose-response curves to angiotensin I and to noradrenaline, administered locally in the hand veins in six healthy male volunteers in doses not producing systemic effects. Both angiotensin I and noradrenaline produced a dose-dependent constriction of the congested veins. The angiotensin I effects were completely abolished after the administration of cilazapril but not significantly altered after the administration of prazosin. The noradrenaline dose-response curves were shifted to the right (dose ratio about 10) by prazosin, but not by cilazapril. The data suggest that angiotensin I, after having been converted to angiotensin II exerts direct venoconstrictor effects which under resting conditions are not mediated by noradrenaline release.", 
    "18": "All studies carried out on stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) have clearly demonstrated that cicletanine protects tissues and vessels. This effect has also been observed with captopril. However, the effectiveness of captopril seemed to be dependent on its blood pressure lowering effect, and this was not found with cicletanine in previous experimental studies on SHR-SP. In view of the difference in effectiveness between captopril and cicletanine as regards blood pressure, it was considered important to compare the two compounds in a similar blood pressure complex. In this study, the effects of cicletanine at two dosage levels (3.33 and 10 mg/kg/day) on the tissue and vascular lesions of SHR-SP were compared with those of captopril in doses of 1 mg/kg/day. Iffa Credo SHR-SP rats aged 7 weeks were divided into four groups of 12 animals each: 2 groups received cicletanine 3.33 and 10 mg/kg/day respectively, 1 group received captopril 1 mg/kg/day and 1 group served as control. Blood pressure was recorded once a week. After 44 days of treatment, all animals were killed and autopsied. A significant antihypertensive effect was observed with both captopril (p less than 0.001) and cicletanine 10 mg/kg (p less than 0.05). In doses of 3.33 mg/kg cicletanine induced only a very slight fall in blood pressure, not significantly different from controls. On the other hand, histological and ultrastructural examinations showed better preservation of tissues and, chiefly, vessels with cicletanine at the two dosage levels than with captopril 1 mg/kg.", 
    "19": "The main vasodepressor hormone systems are the kallikrein-kinin systems and the vascular prostacyclin. Kallikreins release kinins which are the biological active compounds of the kallikrein-kinin systems. Kinins are one of the most potent vasodilators reducing systemic blood pressure by diminution of vascular resistance. The reduction in blood pressure is strongly dose related. Prostacyclin develops similar effects on blood pressure as kinins. There is a close relationship between kinins and prostacyclin since kinins stimulate prostacyclin synthesis very effectively. In arterial hypertension there is a lack in kallikrein-kinin and prostacyclin activity. This could also be shown under experimental conditions in spontaneously hypertensive and in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. In clinical studies these experimental results were confirmed in primary hypertension. The blood pressure response to exogenous vasodepressor hormones is increased in hypertensives suffering from reduced endogenous vasodilator activity. In the knowledge of reduced vasodilator activities in primary hypertension the stimulation of kinins by prostacyclin will be of major interest in the management of primary hypertension. In the last years some drugs have been investigated with regard to their kinin prostacyclin stimulating effect, but only angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, linolenic acid and cicletanin seemed to induce therapeutic prostacyclin stimulation. However, it remains unclear whether these drugs develop their blood pressure lowering effect by stimulation of the discussed vasodilators or by some other effect.", 
    "20": "Antihypertensive mechanisms of SA446, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were examined in dogs. In isolated dog pulmonary artery, SA446 inhibited the contractile response to angiotensin (Ang) I, but did not affect the response to Ang II. In conscious dogs, SA446 (1 mg/kg po) remarkably inhibited the pressor response to Ang I between 1 and 6 hr after the administration. In normotensive dogs, SA446 (30 mg/kg po) significantly lowered the arterial pressure 3 hr after administration, which recovered at 24 hr, while plasma ACE activity was apparently inhibited even at 24 hr. The antihypertensive effect of SA446 (5 mg/kg po) was more potent in 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive dogs than in normotensive dogs. SA446 (10(-9) - 10(-7) M) inhibited the ACE activities in arteries isolated from dogs in concentration-dependent fashion. These results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of SA446 is related, at least partially, to inhibition of ACE in the vascular wall.", 
    "21": "Conditioned medium obtained from bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC) in culture was found to elevate angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (EC) by 2- to 3-fold upon incubation for 24 to 48 h. The elevation in ACE was time dependent and inhibited by 10(-6) M cycloheximide, making it likely that the elevation was related to new protein synthesis by EC. Conditioned medium from EC failed to produce the same effect. The stimulatory effect of SMC conditioned medium on EC ACE was uninfluenced by exposures to anoxia as compared with room air, either during conditioning of medium or while assaying the effect of conditioned medium on EC ACE. Inhibitors of prostaglandin metabolism and calcium transport failed to influence the stimulatory effect of SMC conditioned medium on EC ACE. The stimulatory effect on EC ACE by conditioned medium was additive to that produced by Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and, similar to baseline ACE, was inhibited by 3 x 10(-8) M ouabain. Thus, SMC produce a factor that regulates the level of EC ACE.", 
    "22": "A range of N-terminal fragments of substance P (SP) were evaluated for inhibitory activity against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) from rat lung and brain (striatum). SP inhibited the enzyme from both sources in a concentration dependent manner (IC50 30 microM). The N-terminal fragments SP[1-7], SP[1-6], SP[1-4] and SP[3-4] were equipotent with SP for both sources of the enzyme. However, SP[1-3] showed a difference in its activity, being more active than SP (IC50 10 microM) in inhibiting the brain enzyme, but inactive against lung ACE. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of SP on ACE resides in the N-terminus of the peptide. The difference in reactivity towards SP[1-3] lends support to the idea that lung and brain ACE are different isozymes.", 
    "23": "Fosinopril is the first member of a new chemical class of angiotensin I (AI) converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the phosphinic acids. In vitro, SQ 27,519, the active moiety of the prodrug fosinopril, was a more potent inhibitor of purified rabbit lung ACE- (IC50 = 11 vs. 23 nM) and bradykinin-induced contractions of guinea pig ileum than captopril. In vivo, SQ 27,519 was equipotent to captopril as an inhibitor of an AI pressor response after intravenous (i.v.) administration to conscious rats and monkeys but appeared to be less potent in conscious dogs. After oral administration, fosinopril again was equipotent to captopril as an inhibitor of an AI pressor response in rats and monkeys and slightly less potent in dogs. However, both SQ 27,519 (i.v. studies) and fosinopril (oral studies) had a longer effect than captopril in all three species. When fosinopril was administered orally for 5 days, its effects on an AI pressor response were the same on days 1 and 5, suggesting lack of tolerance to the compound. The ACE inhibitory effect of captopril, but not fosinopril, was prolonged in conscious rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure, suggesting that fosinopril is excreted by an extrarenal route. Finally, fosinopril had no effect on the pressor or chronotropic effects of norepinephrine (NE) or 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperinium (DMPP) or electrical stimulation of the sympathetic ganglia of pithed rats. Fosinopril attenuated the pressor, but not the chronotropic effects of tyramine. We conclude that fosinopril is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of ACE in conscious animal models that does not impair adrenergic function or reflexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in 12 patients within 5 days after their first acute stroke. rCBF was studied by xenon-133 inhalation and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan before and 1 h after oral administration of 25 mg captopril. No increase in rCBF was observed in any of the 12 patients included in the study. In only one patient was there a slight redistribution of blood flow in favor of the low-flow area, but the absolute flow value did not increase. Captopril did not cause any significant change in mean hemispheric blood flow, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), or end-expiratory CO2 fraction (FECO2). The assumption that ACE inhibition might increase cerebral blood flow in the periinfarct zone and preserve some still viable brain tissue could not be verified in the present study.", 
    "25": "Global and regional hemodynamic changes were assessed in 11 patients with congestive heart failure following the introduction of the novel angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), ramipril. All patients were stabilized on digitalis, furosemide, and a fixed diet, central hemodynamics and hormones having been stable over 2 control days. Ramipril resulted in significant falls in converting enzyme activity, angiotensin II, and aldosterone, with a rise in renin. Changes in regional blood flow were assessed 2 h following the first dose of ramipril at the time of maximal increase in global cardiac output (+27%, p less than 0.05), but prior to the maximal fall in systemic arterial pressure. Despite the fall in systemic arterial pressure, blood flow increases were noted in the renal (+93%, p less than 0.05), coronary (+10%), and cerebral (+5%) regions, while forearm blood flow was unchanged. Glomerular filtration rate fell (29%) and was associated with small rises of plasma creatinine and acute sodium retention. After 7 weeks of therapy we noted improvement in functional class (p less than 0.05), exercise time, and left ventricular ejection fraction. We conclude that during inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme activity by ramipril in patients with congestive heart failure, blood flow to the kidneys, heart, and brain is increased or preserved despite hypotension. Long-term therapy is associated with beneficial clinical effects.", 
    "26": "In the case of heart failure of any etiology, so common in the elderly, symptomatic treatment predominates; causal therapy is hardly ever possible. The aim of treatment is to improve myocardial contractility and influence secondary compensation mechanisms which, although associated with a favorable effect in the early stage, in the late stage lead to an unacceptable elevation of afterload and an overall uneconomical cardiac performance, thus producing a negative effect on cardiac failure and its prognosis. In contrast, suitable treatment improves the quality of the patient's life and prolongs life expectancy. In the aged, suitable therapy includes, where indicated, in particular digitalis (there is no alternative!), ACE-inhibitors and diuretics. The incidence and extent of adverse reactions and interactions in the elderly are greater than in the young and middle-aged patient.",

The authors used the following doses per 24 h: D--0.29 +/- 0.96 mg, F--13.5 +/- 4.8 mg, N--40.8 +/- 12.8 mg and K 75.0 +/- 28.8 mg. Each cycle of the therapy was followed by a precise clinical evaluation, analysis of the function of the left ventricle by means of two-dimensional echocardiography, the evaluation of the tolerance of physical effort and the evaluation of chest radiograms. Besides, blood was studied for the concentrations of potassium, sodium, chloride, urea, creatinine, uric acid, haematocrit value and pH value. The addition of nifedipine to the classical therapy did not give significant improvement in the clinical condition, haemodynamic parameters and the tolerance of physical effort in patients with pzns. In comparison to DF period, the use of captopryl brought about a statistically significant increase (p less than 0.05) in ejection fraction (EF) from 43.0 +/- 15.3% up to 45.2 +/- 11.7%, in effort power from 36.5 +/- 16.4W up to 47.1 +/- 17.5W, in effort duration from 3.5 +/- 1.6 min. up to 4.5 +/- 1.8 min. and a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in body weight from 68.1 +/- 13.8 down to 66.9 +/- 13.0 kg and heart volume from 1175.5 +/- 487.3 cm3 down do 1074.6 +/- 380.9 cm3. One could notice, though statistically not significantly (p greater than 0.05) an increase in stroke volume index and cardiae index. Besides, the authors noticed a tendency to an increase in potassium concentration in blood serum. Eliminating captopryl caused fast regression of positive haemodynamic effects, decrease in physical effort tolerance, and clinical condition resumed the condition observed in the period of DFN therapy.", 
    "36": "Taking into account the well-known angiotensin II-induced coronary constriction, in a first series of experiments the effects of captopril were studied upon the rabbit, guinea pig and rat coronary circulation during perfusion with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37 degrees C under constant pressure and variable flow according to the Langendorf technique. The inhibition of angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion enzyme with captopril (5-500 microgr./ml) resulted in a coronary dose dependent dilation as a consequence of a reduction in the basal coronary tonus. Testing the coronary distensibility by using pressure and flow variations revealed a significantly increased distensibility when the conversion enzyme was specifically blocked with captopril. The anginal threshold of the atrial electrostimulation was increased after captopril (25-50 mg i.v.) in 15 out of 18 patients with coronary insufficiency by a mean value of 17%, white the systolic dynamics was significantly better. The obtained results bring new arguments in favour of the intrinsic renin-angiotensin system participation in maintaining the basal vascular tonus and of the increased coronary distensibility in the presence of captopril as an inhibitor of the local synthesis of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.", 
    "37": "A 47-year-old man, with dilated cardiomyopathy developed severe hyponatremia and hypoosmolarity during captopril therapy. He also had an inappropriate elevation of antidiuretic hormone and urine osmolarity, but no evidence of dehydration, renal or suprarenal disturbances. The hyponatremia and hypoosmolarity improved after withdrawal of captopril alone, and recurred after readministration of captopril. We conclude that the hyponatremia may be caused by high secretion of prostagrandin and bradykinin associated with captopril therapy.", 
    "38": "We have attempted to clarify whether or not captopril and 1Sar-8Ile-angiotensin II could protect isoproterenol-induced facilitation of norepinephrine release in guinea pig pulmonary arteries loaded with 3H-norepinephrine. Angiotensin I at 1 nM and 30 nM isoproterenol similarly facilitated evoked release of 3H-norepinephrine at 1 Hz. Captopril at 1 microM and 1Sar-8Ile-angiotensin II at 10 nM completely prevented angiotensin I-induced facilitation, whereas these pretreatments produced no effect on isoproterenol-induced facilitation. Isoproterenol-induced facilitation of norepinephrine release does not primarily involve a local angiotensin II mechanism.", 
    "39": "Renal and hemodynamic effects of diet alone and of single oral doses of the nonsulphydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazepril (10 mg), were investigated in eight healthy volunteers under stable conditions of high salt intake (300 mmol NaCl/day) and low salt intake (10 mmol NaCl/day), in a double blind, placebo controlled study. There were no changes in blood pressure between the two dietary extremes either during the run-in period or once sodium balance had been achieved. Mean renal plasma flow was higher, by approximately 10% and renal vascular resistance lower by 15%, on high salt diet compared to low salt diet. Glomerular filtration rates were found to be similar irrespective of the state of salt balance. Both plasma urate concentration and plasma renin activity were significantly elevated in the low salt compared to high salt state. Benazepril caused a greater fall in blood pressure in the sodium depleted state. Significant increases in the mean renal plasma flow, in the order of 15-20%, were seen over 6 h postbenazepril when compared with placebo response, regardless of the level of salt intake. Glomerular filtration rate over the same period remained unaltered. Benazepril doubled the urinary excretion of sodium over the first 4 hours after dosing whilst on the low salt diet; the equivalent increase during salt loading was approximately 20%. These results suggest that benazepril may exert direct effects on renal tubular function additional to those achieved through ACE blockade.", 
    "40": "1. The efficacy of captopril and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) as adjunctive therapy to digoxin and diuretics in mild heart failure was compared in a double-blind study. 2. Twenty-one patients were randomly allocated to captopril (twice or three times daily) or ISDN. Eighteen patients completed a protocol of placebo run-in, dose titration and maintenance treatment for 3 months. 3. Symptom-limited exercise tolerance, ejection fraction and radionuclide indices of diastolic function estimated by gated blood pool scan did not change with either treatment. 4. Captopril improved functional class (Canadian Cardiovascular Society) and reduced requirements for increased diuretic dosage at both 1 and 3 months of maintenance treatment. Patients treated with ISDN required increased diuretic and did not improve their functional class. Differences between the treatments were significant only for diuretic dosage requirements. 5. We conclude that adjunctive therapy of mild heart failure with captopril administered twice daily provides a diuretic-sparing effect and may improve functional class during 3 months of maintenance treatment.", 
    "41": "In order to investigate whether angiotensin II (Ang II) may contribute to cardiovascular regulation through facilitation of the adrenergic function, we examined the haemodynamic and humoral effects of the application of lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) in sodium-replete patients with essential hypertension before and after acute and chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. We measured the changes in blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, forearm blood flow, plasma noradrenaline, renin activity and Ang II induced by LBNP of two different magnitudes: a milder one deactivating predominantly the cardiopulmonary receptors (mild LBNP), and a greater one deactivating both the cardiopulmonary and the arterial baroreceptors (strong LBNP). We found that during mild LBNP systemic blood pressure was maintained after acute and chronic ACE inhibition, as in control studies; however, the decrements in forearm blood flow and the increments in forearm vascular resistance caused by LBNP were diminished after ACE inhibition (the latter by 69 and 67%, respectively, in acute and chronic studies), in spite of the fact that the falls in central venous pressure and the increases in noradrenaline (NA) were similar to those observed in control conditions. During strong LBNP, the fall in systemic blood pressure was greater after acute and chronic ACE inhibition than in control conditions and was associated with a reduction in the response of forearm vascular resistance similar to that observed during mild LBNP, while the increments in NA were again superimposable to those seen before ACE inhibition. These alterations in the haemodynamic responses to LBNP induced by ACE inhibition were associated with significant increments in basal plasma renin activity and with marked reductions in Ang II. These findings suggest that even in the sodium-replete state, Ang II exerts a facilitatory action on adrenergic function that is physiologically relevant for the regulation of forearm blood flow and the maintenance of blood pressure during the application of gravitational stresses.", 
    "42": "Local vascular generation of angiotensin was investigated in isolated perfused rat hindquarters. Extraction and combined high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/radioimmunoassay analysis of hindlimb perfusate showed a spontaneous release of angiotensin I (Ang I; 5.0 +/- 3.4 fmol/h) and angiotensin II (Ang II; 31.8 +/- 7.9 fmol/h). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril abolished Ang II release while Ang I levels increased more than 10-fold. Perfusion with purified hog renin caused a dose-dependent angiotensin release and vasoconstriction. The renin inhibitor H-142 abolished all effects of renin whereas ACE inhibition prevented Ang II formation and vasoconstriction but increased Ang I levels. Metabolism and pressor effects of synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate (TDP), Ang I and Ang II were studied using a recirculating rat hindlimb perfusion system. TDP-dependent formation of Ang I and II, and an increase in perfusion pressure was shown; ACE inhibition reduced but did not abolish Ang II formation and vasoconstriction. Ang I was converted to Ang II by about 50% during one pass through a hindlimb. This conversion was abolished by ACE inhibition. These data add support to the presence of a functional vascular renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "43": "The Authors investigated anterior pituitary function in hypertensive patients in basal conditions and following a 15-day course of treatment with captopril, a drug which blocks the generation of Angiotensin II (Angio II).

II in modulating some aspects of pituitary function is proposed.", 
    "44": "Ten hypertensive patients (I-IIWHO) were treated for a period of three months with captopril 50 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once or twice daily, with the aim of evaluating the antihypertensive effectiveness of this association and the lack of influences on lipid and mainly glucose metabolism. Blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated every month, while chemical tests were performed at the beginning and at the end of the trial. Besides before and after treatment were studied blood glucose and insulin levels during oral glucose tolerance test, at times 0, 15', 30', 60', 90', 120', 180'. Our data show that captopril combined with hydrochlorothiazide has a good antihypertensive action, and doesn't alter lipid and glucose metabolism either after oral glucose tolerance test.", 
    "45": "Hypophysectomized and pituitary-intact rats were tested for their expression of salt hunger under a variety of experimental conditions. The results show that hypophysectomized rats ingest less salt in response to salt hunger induced by sodium depletion, captopril or angiotensin in comparison to pituitary-intact rats. In contrast, both groups ingest the same amount of salt in response to mineralocorticoid-induced salt hunger. While sodium excretion and plasma sodium levels were comparable in the two groups, the angiotensinogen mRNA was reduced by hypophysectomy in several limbic brain regions as well as in the liver. These results suggest that reduced salt intake in response to manipulations of the body sodium and renin-angiotensin system in hypophysectomized rats may result from decreased angiotensinogen mRNA levels.", 
    "46": "The renal effects of a single intravenous dose of two different E. coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS 0111:B4 and LPS 0127:B8), at the same dose of 100 micrograms/kg, were evaluated in euvolemic Munich-Wistar (MW) rats by whole kidney clearance techniques and micropuncture studies. Following LPS infusion, a significant decrease (8%) in mean BP was observed only in the LPS 0127:B8 treated group. Inulin clearance fell 57% (LPS 0111:B4), P less than 0.01, and 38% (LPS 0127:B8), P less than 0.01. Para-aminohippuric (PAH) clearance decreased 31% (P less than 0.01) and total effective renal vascular resistance rose 70% (P less than 0.03) in response to LPS 0111:B4. No significant change in PAH clearance was noted in the LPS 0127:B8 group. Superficial single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) was reduced 69% (LPS 0111:B4), P less than 0.03, and 33% (LPS 0127:B8), P less than 0.02. Superficial glomerular plasma flow fell 48% (LPS 0111:B4), P less than 0.03, and 24% (LPS 0127:B8), P less than 0.03. Both lipopolysaccharides were associated with an increase in afferent arteriolar resistance (RA) which accounted for a reduction in the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC). There was no change in the proximal tubular pressure in either group and, therefore, the net transcapillary hydraulic pressures were reduced. No measurable change in the ultrafiltration coefficient. Kf, was observed in either group. In a second set of protocols, the effect of prior administration of indomethacin or captopril on LPS 0111:B4 action was investigated. A significant decrease in BP occurred when animals were pretreated with captopril. Both indomethacin and captopril prevented the renal effects of LPS 0111:B4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "To compare the impact of differing antihypertensive regimens on the development of renal injury, studies were performed in three groups of moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats, and one group of non-diabetic control (C) rats. One diabetic group (DM) received no therapy except insulin. The remaining diabetic groups received insulin and either the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP), or triple therapy (TRX) with reserpine, hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide. CAP and TRX modestly and comparably lowered blood pressure. At 6 to 10 weeks, DM rats exhibited elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR), due to elevations of the glomerular capillary plasma flow rate (QA) and the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC). In both DM/CAP and DM/TRX rats, blood pressure reduction was associated with selective normalization of PGC, without change in SNGFR or QA. In long-term (70 weeks) studies, DM rats exhibited progressive albuminuria and marked glomerular sclerosis. CAP limited albuminuria and injury to values even lower than those in C rats, whereas TRX served only to delay, but not to prevent, the increase in albuminuria. TRX reduced glomerular sclerosis, but was less effective than CAP. At 70 weeks, CAP and TRX still reduced systemic blood pressure; PGC remained at normal levels with CAP but was no longer controlled with TRX. These results confirm the clinical observation that antihypertensive therapy slows diabetic glomerulopathy, but also suggest that CAP affords superior long-term protection as compared to the other antihypertensive drug regimen studied.", 
    "48": "Fifty to sixty percent of clinical hypertension is sensitive to sodium (Na) intake: known causes, primary aldosteronism, bilateral renal artery stenosis, mild azotemia, acromegaly, and low-renin hypertension account for only a fraction. We have identified a group of normal-renin hypertensives characterized by inability to modulate normally their renal vascular and adrenal responsiveness to angiotensin II. These patients handle shifts in Na intake abnormally, show more positive balance on a high-salt diet, and raise their blood pressure when shifted to a high-salt diet. Renal blood flow does not shift with Na intake, but does respond strikingly to converting enzyme inhibition, which also corrects altered renal and adrenal responsiveness, ability to handle a sodium load, and hypertension. These patients have a striking family history of hypertension; 50% of the offspring of hypertensives show similar features, including a renal vasodilator response to converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blocking agents. Accumulating evidence suggests that the abnormality is inherited and may be the most common form of hypertension.", 
    "49": "Pharmacological suppression of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), both as monotherapy and in conjunction with other conventional agents, has been proven to be an effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Renin is the enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate limiting step, preceding the involvement of ACE, in the production of the potent pressor hormone angiotensin II (Ang II). Unlike ACE, which has multiple substrates, renin is selective for a single naturally occurring substrate, angiotensinogen. Interruption of the generation of ANG II by renin inhibitors at the highly specific, initial step of the cascade may have therapeutic advantages over ACE inhibitors and other antihypertensive agents with less precise mechanisms of action, by producing fewer clinical side effects. Exciting advances in the discovery of renin inhibitors have led to the synthesis of potent, dipeptide inhibitors of renin, which have been shown in the laboratory to be efficacious hypotensive agents when administered intravenously. Although there are recently reported compounds that demonstrate some degree of oral activity, efforts to enhance bioavailability are presently underway in order to develop orally active therapeutic agents. The development of renin inhibitors will provide target-specific agents for the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders, and will serve as invaluable tools to study the role of the RAS in regulating blood pressure and fluid volume. An overview of the progress in the discovery and development of renin inhibitors is presented.", 
    "50": "Pemphigus is an autoimmune disease proved to be mediated by IgG autoantibodies. Skin lesions clinically and histologically identical to pemphigus may occur in patients receiving penicillamine and captopril, but some of these patients lack circulating or tissue-bound autoantibodies. Therefore, we examined the ability of these drugs to produce acantholysis directly in organ explant culture. Human skin explants were prepared from split-thickness graft skin from adults and from neonatal foreskins. Explants were cultured in media containing 0.1 to 200 mmol/L of penicillamine or captopril; parallel drug-free control cultures were also prepared. Acantholysis occurred in all split-thickness graft skin cultures incubated for 72 hours with at least 20 mmol/L of penicillamine and at 24 to 48 hours in those incubated with at least 10 mmol/L of captopril. Acantholysis occurred less frequently in foreskin cultures, being present in 1 (8%) of 12 of those exposed to at least 20 mmol/L of penicillamine and 3 (12%) of 25 of those exposed to at least 10 mmol/L of captopril. None of the parallel drug-free control cultures developed acantholysis. Subcorneal acantholysis, resembling that seen in pemphigus foliaceus, and suprabasilar acantholysis, resembling that seen in pemphigus vulgaris, were induced in vitro. Our results indicate that both drugs can act as ligands and produce acantholysis in organ explant culture in the absence of autoantibody. This ligand-induced acantholysis may also be responsible for induction of the disease in vivo in those patients who lack demonstrable autoantibodies.", 
    "51": "Both domperidone (DOMP) and metoclopramide (MCP) are D2 receptor antagonists, MCP being a central and peripheral dopamine antagonist, whereas DOMP is exclusively a peripheral antagonist. MCP, but not DOMP, has been shown to stimulate aldosterone production. To elucidate whether aldosterone stimulation by dopamine antagonism is centrally mediated, we injected DOMP (28 micrograms/kg body wt) via a cannula into the third ventricle in Sprague-Dawley rats. Plasma aldosterone and renin concentration were measured before and 15 min after the injection. Centrally administered DOMP resulted in an increment in plasma aldosterone (23.8 +/- 7.4 ng/dl) that was not significantly greater than that induced by vehicle alone (15.8 +/- 4.5 ng/dl). This increase was inhibited by pretreatment with dexamethasone (100 micrograms three times daily) and attenuated by captopril (1 mg/kg ip) but not by L-beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (30 mg/kg), thus reflecting a stress effect. Similarly, central administration of MCP (21 micrograms/kg) resulted in a significant rise in plasma aldosterone. This increase, however, was eliminated by pretreatment with dexamethasone and attenuated by captopril. Peripherally administered DOMP (280 micrograms/kg) had no effect on plasma aldosterone. The effect of DOMP and MCP on aldosterone secretion by freshly obtained adrenal capsules was also tested. Angiotensin II and MCP, but not DOMP, induced a dose-dependent increase in aldosterone secretion, with a maximal increment (15.7 +/- 5.8 ng.mg capsular protein-1.10 min-1; 50% increase) with MCP at 10(-7) M (P less than 0.01 compared with controls). Dopamine completely inhibited this MCP-induced rise in aldosterone release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "The pathophysiologic changes occurring in cardiovascular disease can affect the kinetics of drugs in several different ways. The present review examines these modifications and the underlying mechanisms. The kinetics of specific agents, such as antiarrhythmic, antihypertensive, cardiotonic, and other drugs are considered, and the clinical implications are outlined. The clinician should be aware of these modifications, because they require an adjustment of the dosage regimen. A rational basis for a correct therapeutic choice can be provided by adequate knowledge of these modifications.", 
    "53": "The binding of radiolabelled ligands with high affinity for kappa-opioid binding sites has been studied in homogenates of lumbo-sacral spinal cord from the rat. The unselective ligands [3H]bremazocine and [3H]diprenorphine labelled a large number of sites which could not be fully resolved in terms of mu-, delta- and kappa-types by displacement assays. In particular binding at the kappa-site appeared anomalous in that sites which could be identified as high affinity kappa-type represented only 40% of total kappa-binding, defined using the unselective [3H]ligands. This was confirmed by the low levels of binding seen with the kappa-agonists [3H]dynorphin A(1-9) and [3H]U-69593. In guinea-pig cord, under conditions in which binding to mu- and delta-sites was suppressed, [3H]dynorphin A(1-9) and [3H]U-69593 labelled only 60% of the kappa population, defined by the [3H]unselective ligands. The reasons for the observed discrepancies are discussed.", 
    "54": "Because of the physiologic changes associated with aging, a nonpharmacologic approach is recommended as initial therapy for the elderly hypertensive. Approximately 80% of this patient population, however, requires pharmacologic therapy, as well. When initiating drug treatment, the physician should remember several guidelines and have some understanding of the mechanisms of action of the available agents. The four drug classes recommended by JNC IV for the treatment of high blood pressure are quite similar in effectiveness. Low-dose diuretics, however, particularly when combined with a potassium-sparing agent, produce significantly fewer adverse reactions than seen with the other classes of drugs. This advantage, coupled with their low cost, makes diuretics the reasonable first choice for the treatment of older hypertensives.", 
    "55": "Symptomatic and metabolic side effects seen in the treatment of elderly hypertensive patients are an area of concern for physicians. Of the four drug classes used as Step 1 antihypertensive agents--diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium-entry blocking agents--only diuretics have been studied as monotherapy for the elderly in placebo-controlled, long-term clinical trials. These studies have shown diuretics to be well tolerated in this patient population, producing only mild, infrequent side effects.", 
    "56": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) generates angiotensin II and is also capable of degrading bradykinin into inactive peptides. It has been suggested that the effects of ACE inhibitors are partially mediated by increased prostaglandin synthesis induced by a simultaneous rise in bradykinin. Captopril increases PG excretion and indomethacin (INDO) attenuates its effects. Enalapril is a long acting ACE inhibitor, and its molecule does not have the sulphydryl group present in captopril. In order to evaluate the participations of PG in a the ENA effects of enalapril (ENA) on arterial pressure (AP), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (ALDO) and renal hemodynamics (RH) in essential hypertension (EHT), we compared the effects of ENA alone and associated with INDO. Nine EHT patients received on different occasions: ENA 10 mg, INDO 25 mg and ENA-INDO. Arterial pressure, PGE2, ALDO, PRA, RH and plasma and urinary ENA as enalaprylate were measured after each treatment. Maximal ENA absorption occurred after 4 hours, however it was still detectable after 72 hr. ENA decreased AP after 6 hr in spite of unchanged PGE2 excretion; PRA did not change and ALDO decreased transiently. INDO delayed ENA absorption, slightly attenuated the fall in AP and suppressed PGE2 excretion when given with ENA. INDO alone suppressed PGE2 and did not alter AP. No significant changes occurred in RH with the treatments. Our results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of ENA is independent of PG, and that the slight attenuation induced by INDO may be attributed to a delay in intestinal absorption. In EHT patients under normovolemic conditions, renal function is not altered by ACE inhibition.", 
    "57": "Pharmacokinetic data from 20-min constant rate infusions of the ACE inhibitor S-9780 1 mg to 16 subjects were studied for evidence of nonlinearity. A hierarchy of standard compartmental models and of nonlinear binding models was fitted to the data by least squares nonlinear regression and the most appropriate model was chosen on the basis of F-ratio tests, Schwarz criteria, and residual plots. A one-compartment model which included saturable tissue and plasma binding components allowed the best overall description of the data. Median parameter estimates from this model suggest that approximately 308 nmol of plasma binding sites and 572 nmol of tissue binding sites were present and that the total plasma concentration of S-9780 at 50% saturation of binding sites was 16.5 nmol L-1. The elimination half-life for free drug in plasma was only 30 min. This model describes the discrepancy previously noted between accumulation and apparent elimination half-lives for long-acting ACE inhibitors and offers a noninvasive method for assessment of tissue-bound ACE inhibitor in vivo.", 
    "58": "We studied 11 patients affected by mild essential hypertension during chronic therapy with enalapril (E). After a pharmacological wash-out the patients were treated with E once a day (10-20 mg) for 4 weeks. Before and after the treatment period the patients were studied by means of the isotonic exercise stress test on the cycloergometer with increments of 25 W every 2 min and by means of the Sustained Handgrip test (SHG) at 70% of maximal capacity for 1 min. During the study period E reduced the blood pressure at rest in all patients without untoward effects. During the isotonic test and particularly during SHG, E reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and the product systolic BP x heart rate. The treatment did not influence the time length of the isotonic exercise stress test. Our results suggest that E does not increase the MVO2 at rest and during different types of exercise: this can be very important because many patients affected by hypertension suffer from ischemic heart disease. E is utilized also in patients with heart failure, some of whom have an hypertensive or ischemic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "59": "The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on renal and extrarenal potassium (K) regulation was examined. Six healthy men were studied in double-blinded crossover fashion on placebo or enalapril, 80 mg/day. On day 4, the subjects were given an intravenous infusion of KCl and on day 5 an oral dose of 10% NH4Cl. Treatment with enalapril decreased plasma aldosterone and increased plasma renin activity (PRA), epinephrine and norepinephrine, but did not affect serum glucose, plasma insulin or basal plasma K. Maximal increases in plasma K during K infusion or NH4Cl ingestion were similar during enalapril and placebo treatment. With enalapril treatment urinary K excretion was unchanged following K loading but moderately reduced following NH4Cl loading. We conclude that ACE inhibition does not acutely impair K homeostasis in men with normal renal function.", 
    "60": "1. This was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel study in 216 patients with mild to moderate (supine diastolic blood pressure = 95-115 mm Hg) essential hypertension. 2. After a 4-week placebo washout, patients were randomized to placebo or lisinopril 1.25, 5.20 or 80 mg once daily for 6 consecutive weeks. Supine and erect blood pressure was measured 24 h postdose at the end of weeks -2, 0, 2, 4, and 6. 3. There was a linear dose-response relationship for both supine and erect blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure reductions in the lisinopril 20 and 80 mg day-1 groups were significantly greater than in the placebo or lisinopril 1.25 and 5 mg day-1 groups. 4. Lisinopril, at doses up to 80 mg day-1, was well tolerated.",

    "62": "Thirty healthy patients, who were to undergo surgery which required tracheal intubation, were given an intravenous injection of enalaprilat (either 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg or 4 mg; six patients for each dose) or normal saline 17 minutes before induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone 3-5 mg/kg, and suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. Postural manoeuvres were performed 5 minutes before and 6, 11 and 16 minutes after enalaprilat or saline. Complete inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme occurred with all doses of enalaprilat, which allowed the four different treatment groups to be considered as one large treated group. The mean arterial pressure was almost unchanged during the postural manoeuvres; the heart rate increased, mostly similarly (by approximately 10%) in both groups. Mean arterial pressure in the recumbent position decreased over the 17 minutes before induction in the enalaprilat group, and increased slightly in the control group (treated mean, -5.0%; controls mean, 1.8%; difference, -6.8%; 95% confidence intervals of difference, -2.3 to -11.3%, p less than 0.01). This difference was again seen after induction (treated, -8.0%; controls, 7.7%; confidence intervals of difference, -0.6 to -31%) and for a 5-minute period shortly after tracheal intubation. The increases in mean arterial pressure produced by intubation itself were similar in both groups (treated, + 36%; controls, + 35%; 95% confidence intervals of difference, -16% to + 18%). Changes in heart rate after induction were also similar in both groups. It is concluded that intravenous enalaprilat acted as a hypotensive agent with a sparing effect on autonomic reflexes, both before and after induction of anaesthesia.", 
    "63": "The modulation of the release of noradrenaline (NA) and neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) was investigated in the pig kidney in vivo. Under control conditions a reproducible co-release of NA and NPY-LI was obtained upon stimulation of the renal nerves with 5 Hz for 1 min. Infusion of peptide YY (PYY, 1 microgram/kg/min i.v.), which binds to NPY receptors, caused renal vasoconstriction and reduced the stimulation-evoked overflow of NA and NPY-LI by 24 +/- 4 and 33 +/- 11%, respectively (P less than 0.01). The PYY effect was reversible and was absent 1 h after the infusion. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) enhanced the overflow of NA and NPY-LI 2- to 3-fold. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg i.v.) did not significantly affect the overflow of NA or NPY-LI evoked by the nerve stimulation. Angiotensin II (0.5 microgram/kg/min i.v.), on the other hand, induced a reversible enhancement of the overflow of both NA and NPY-LI by 71 and 77%, respectively (P less than 0.01). Infusion of endothelin (0.2 microgram/kg/min i.v.), which reduced renal blood flow by a magnitude similar to that evoked by angiotensin II, did not significantly alter the nerve stimulation-evoked overflow of NA or NPY-LI. None of the administered drugs did significantly affect the percentage reduction in renal blood flow evoked by nerve stimulation. It is concluded that the release of NA and NPY-LI from sympathetic nerves in the pig kidney is inhibited in parallel via activation of NPY receptors by PYY and via alpha 2-adrenoceptors by endogenous NA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "We studied the effects of atrial natriuretic factor on the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Atrial natriuretic factor had a novel effect on angiotensin I conversion. Pulmonary artery endothelial cells converted 1.22 nmol/min/dish of [125I]angiotensin I to II in the absence of atrial natriuretic factor, but this activity was suppressed by atrial natriuretic factor. When atrial natriuretic factor was added to pulmonary artery endothelial cells, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was suppressed 0.475 nmol/min/dish at 10(-6) M of atrial natriuretic factor.", 
    "65": "A 65-year-old male with a long history of congestive heart failure presented to the emergency room with facial swelling 7 h after the first dose of enalapril. He was treated with diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone which improved his angioedema. However, there was a profound relapse of the angioedema followed by respiratory arrest. He suffered severe anoxic brain damage and died five days later. It is likely that the long half-life of enalapril lead to this rebound phenomenon. Enalapril induced angioedema is reviewed with suggestions for management.", 
    "66": "Since one of the hypotensive mechanisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) has been suggested to be mediated through the renal kinin-prostaglandin (PG) axis, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of captopril (C) or enalapril (E) on renal PGE2 excretion or synthesis. Wistar male rats (BW 200-250 g) were given orally captopril at 30 mg/kg/day or enalapril at 10 or 30 mg/kg for one week. Before and after ACEI, blood pressure (tail cuff method) as well as PRA and urinary PGE2 excretion was determined. Renopapillary slices were obtained from some of the rats including controls and incubated to determine PGE2 synthesis. C or E administration resulted in a blood pressure decrease of 21 to 36 mm Hg with an increase in PRA. Urine volume and sodium excretion increased after daily treatment with C or E at 30 mg/kg. Urinary PGE2 excretion increased 1.4-fold in response to C, but not to E. Papillary PGE2 synthesis demonstrated a marked decrease 2 h after in vivo administration of either ACEI compared to controls. However, when C or enalaprilat was added in vitro to renal slices obtained from controls, only C at 10(-5) M showed a significant 2-fold increase in renal PGE2 synthesis. These results suggest that (1) renal PGE2 synthesis may be dependent on circulating angiotensin II. (2) C, but not enalaprilat, has a direct stimulatory effect on renal PGE2 synthesis and (3) renal PGE2 may not be involved very much in the hypotensive effect of ACEI.", 
    "67": "We quantitated the glomerular size and the degree of sclerosis simultaneously in individual glomeruli with the use of three-dimensional histological analysis on serial sections obtained from remnant kidneys with highly heterogeneous glomerular lesions after subtotal nephrectomy (sNPX). Four to six weeks after sNPX (Group I, N = 7), 90% of glomeruli had mild sclerosis (sclerosis index, SI; less than 1.5 on a 0 to 4 scale) with a strong positive correlation between the maximum planar area of glomerulus (PAmax) versus SI. Twelve weeks after sNPX (Group II, N = 6) more than 50% of glomeruli had advanced sclerosis (average SI:1.88), and a significant positive correlation was again found between PAmax and SI in glomeruli with mild to modest sclerosis (SI less than 1.5), whereas these two variables were correlated inversely in glomeruli with advanced sclerosis. Administration of enalapril (50 mg/liter drinking water) or hydralazine (200 mg/liter) + hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/liter) for 12 weeks (Group III, N = 12) markedly attenuated the sclerosis to comparable degrees (average SI: 0.15 vs. 0.22). The former antihypertensive therapy decreased glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC) to normal range, whereas the latter triple drug therapy was largely without effect on PGC. Of note, the positive correlation between SI and PAmax remained unaffected by these anti-hypertensive drugs. SI of the glomeruli from both treated groups was expressed as a first-order function of PAmax. The correlation coefficient is identical to that found in non-treated Group II remnant glomeruli, so that the degree of sclerosis is mathematically uniquely correlated with the glomerular size, regardless of drug treatment. Thus, within a given remnant kidney, the magnitude of glomerular hypertrophy has a direct correlation with the degree of sclerosis, while the altered glomerular hemodynamic pattern has little modulatory role in determining the magnitude of this hypertrophy. Enalapril and triple drug therapy, at equi-depressor doses in regard to systemic blood pressure, had identical potency in sparing glomerular structure. The primary determinant for this antisclerotic potency appears to be related to the drugs' potency to inhibit glomerular growth rather than an effect on the abnormal hemodynamics which develop in the glomerulus.", 
    "68": "Eighteen patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (three female, mean age 57 years), were treated for 48 weeks with enalapril added to digoxin and diuretic therapy for congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II (three patients). III (eight patients) and IV (seven patients), respectively. Serum levels of erythropoietin (EPO) were raised at the start (37 +/- 12.8 pmol 1(-1); mean +/- SD) and were normalized during enalapril treatment (17.5 +/- 9.9 pmol 1(-1) at 48 weeks; P less than 0.001). Serum EPO correlated at the start with NYHA functional class (r = 0.68; P less than 0.05). Normalization of elevated serum EPO concentrations during treatment with enalapril paralleled clinical and haemodynamic improvement, and probably reflected relief from renal hypoxia.", 
    "69": "Male wistar rats drank in a dose-related manner, in response to 1 to 40 U/kg of i.p. insulin. Maximum intakes took place during the first 30 min after i.p. insulin administration, coinciding with the period of maximal drop of blood glucose. Plasma renin activity (PRA) in rats treated with i.p. insulin was higher than in basal conditions or after saline injection. Nephrectomy and adrenalectomy did not abolish insulin-induced drinking. A low dose of captopril (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) did not modify insulin-induced drinking, but a higher dose (10 mg/kg s.c.), or enalapril (0.5 mg/microgram s.c.), significantly increased insulin-induced drinking. Enhancement of insulin-induced drinking by s.c. captopril was not secondary to an increased diuresis. Captopril (50 micrograms i.c.v.) significantly reduced the cumulative water intake after i.p. insulin (20 U/kg i.p.) plus s.c. captopril (10 mg/kg). The blockade of central receptors for angiotensin II with sarile-AII (5 micrograms) significantly diminished insulin-induced drinking. It appears that the peripheral renin angiotensin system is not necessary for insulin-induced drinking but central angiotensin II plays an important role.", 
    "70": "Whether the renin-angiotensin system is activated during rat gestation is controversial. Therefore we serially assessed plasma renin activity in unrestrained, chronically instrumented conscious rats during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Plasma renin activity was 3.26 +/- 0.30, 2.80 +/- 0.31, and 2.70 +/- 0.26 ng.ml-1.hr-1 on gestational days 6, 12, and 20, respectively. When the same rats were studied after delivery, plasma renin activity was 1.87 +/- 0.29, 1.81 +/- 0.09, and 2.31 +/- 0.35 ng.ml-1.hr-1 on postpartum days 3, 6, and 11, respectively. Levels measured during pregnancy were significantly greater than in the postpartum period (p less than 0.05 or less than 0.01). We then evaluated potential functional consequences of the renin-angiotensin system in gravid rats. Near term, renal hemodynamics fall from the peak levels of midgestation; we tested whether angiotensin II mediates this apparent vasoconstriction. Captopril (1.5 mg/kg, 1.5 mg.kg-1.hr-1) was acutely administered to lower circulating angiotensin II. The drug produced an 80% inhibition of angiotensin I pressor response, a tenfold elevation in plasma renin activity, but caused the same degree of mild renal vasodilation in rats whether they were virgin or pregnant. We also tested whether prior occupancy of receptors by endogenous hormone or receptor downregulation mediates the attenuated pressor response to angiotensin II observed during late pregnancy. Acute administration of captopril failed to augment refractory pressor responsiveness. Chronic treatment with enalaprilat (2.0 mg.kg-1.day-1 by osmotic minipump) also did not restore pressor responsiveness. But, in our hands, chronic administration of enalaprilat most likely failed to lower plasma angiotensin II. In summary, we suggest that during rat gestation (1) the renin-angiotensin system is activated, (2) angiotensin II does not mediate the apparent renal vasoconstriction observed near term, (3) prior receptor occupancy by endogenous hormone is not responsible for the attenuated pressor response to angiotensin II, and (4) long-term treatment with enalaprilat can produce hypotension without reducing plasma concentrations of angiotensin II.", 
    "71": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, E.C. 3.14.5.1) was localized in the rat eye by immunocytochemical staining using anti-rat lung ACE monoclonal antibody, and by autoradiography using the potent ACE inhibitor [3H]captopril. Highest levels of ACE immunoreactivity and [3H]captopril binding were found in the ciliary epithelium (Bmax = 1050 fmol [3H]captopril bound/mg protein) while lower levels were present in the sclera (Bmax = 500 fmol/mg protein). Scattered regions of the choroidal epithelium were weakly immunocytochemically stained by the anti-ACE antibody. No other major sites of labeling of ACE were demonstrated. In the ciliary epithelium, ACE was confined to cells bordering on the posterior chamber of the eye, similar to its presence at the ventricular surface of the choroid plexus of the brain. These findings suggest that ACE may metabolize a peptide involved in the regulation of aqueous humor production.", 
    "72": "We have investigated the relative importance of renal renin stores and de novo synthesis during stimulation of renin secretion and the role of transcription and posttranscriptional factors in providing increased synthesis of renin. When enalapril was administered to previously untreated mice, plasma renin concentration increased 40-fold within 1.5 hours, and remained at a high level for the 8 days of the experiment. Renal renin decreased by 82% after 24 hours and thereafter increased to levels higher than controls. Calculations of renin turnover, based on data for the rate of metabolism of renin in plasma, indicated that most of the renin released in the first 24 hours could be accounted for by the decrease in renal renin stores, indicating that de novo synthesis played only a minor role. After 24 hours, however, when both plasma renin concentration and renal renin increased, the calculated rate of renin synthesis increased to nearly 40 times the rate in controls. When enalapril was administered to mice that had been depleted of plasma and renal renin by chronic sodium loading, plasma renin concentration increased markedly within 1.5 hours, but to only half the level achieved in the previously untreated mice. No decrease in renal renin occurred, suggesting that the renal renin remaining after chronic sodium loading was not available for release. Renal renin messenger RNA increased 4.5-fold after 6 hours, and after 8 days had increased to 5.0 times the level at day 0. The increase in calculated rate of renin synthesis was maximal between 5 and 8 days, when it was 54 times greater than at day 0. During enalapril treatment, there were marked increases in the granulation of the juxtaglomerular cells and in the amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus they contained. These results suggest that posttranscriptional factors play a major role in determining the rate of renin synthesis.", 
    "73": "The potential pathogenic role of angiotensin-II (AII) in early progressive diabetic and renal ablation-induced glomerulosclerosis was explored and compared in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat and the mongrel dog. Male SD rats were divided into control and streptozotocin-treated (65 mg/kg, iv) groups. Unilateral surgical nephrectomy (Nx) was performed in half of each group. Enalapril (E; 50 mg/liter in the drinking water) was administered to half of each subgroup. Enalapril (high E; 250 mg/liter) was given to another 13 streptozotocin rats. All diabetic rats were treated with sc NPH insulin (4 U/day), and blood glucose was 520 +/- 124 mg/dl (mean +/- SD). Microalbuminuria was measured by RIA in 24-h urine collections; wet kidney weights were compared. [125I]AII binding assays were performed on isolated glomeruli. In control rats the high affinity binding dissociation constant (Kd) was 0.59 +/- 0.15 nM (n = 26; mean +/- SD) and receptor number (Ro) was 732 +/- 195 fmol/mg glomerular protein. At 3 weeks, the diabetic glomerular AII receptor Kd was 0.38 +/- 0.07 nM (n = 6; P less than 0.02 vs. control) and Ro was 784 +/- 97 fmol/mg protein (P = NS vs. control); diabetic high E Kd was 0.39 +/- 0.06 nM (n = 6; P less than 0.02 vs. control), and Ro was 873 +/- 105 fmol/mg protein (P = NS vs. diabetes without E). By 10 weeks, a Kd of 0.49 +/- 0.12 nM (n = 32; P less than 0.01 vs. control) and a Ro of 780 +/- 174 fmol/mg protein (P = NS vs. control) were observed when all of the diabetic group data were pooled. Neither Nx nor low or high dose E altered Ro. This is evidence that intraglomerular AII levels are normal or reduced after diabetes, Nx, or both. In the diabetic group, low dose E partially prevented, and high E abolished, Nx-enhanced microalbuminuria and renal hypertrophy. In nine pancreatectomized insulin-treated mongrel dogs over a 12- to 24-month period, despite moderately poor glucose control (300 +/- 75 mg/dl) and combined unilateral Nx in five dogs (12 months), elevated microalbuminuria was not observed. [125I]AII binding to isolated normal and diabetic dog glomeruli revealed the Kd to be of low affinity (1.86 +/- 0.28 to 13.80 +/- 1.88 nM), identifying the presence of type B receptors. Hence, the SD rat and mongrel dog differ in susceptibility to glomerular AII receptor type and progressive diabetic glomerulopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "74": "Alterations in the vasopressor system found in cardiac failure are part of compensatory measures that may modify pharmacologic-therapeutic response. Therefore, in 64 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, we investigated its enhanced activity in different clinical stages of the disease as compared to normal controls. Patients in NYHA class II (n = 20) demonstrated increased activity of the sympathico-adrenal, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic factor systems, while maximum values were found in patients of NYHA class IV (n = 24). In these patients, noradrenaline was enhanced by a factor of 7, adrenaline by a factor of 2, plasma-renin-activity by a factor of 7, angiotensin II by a factor of 2.5, aldosterone by a factor of 5, vasopressin by a factor of 1.5, and ANF by a factor of 4 as compared to normal controls. Clinical NYHA classes correlated to a certain degree with the various plasma hormones. Patients treated with an aldosterone inhibitor in addition to digitalis and diuretics revealed significantly higher values for aldosterone, vasopressin, and angiotensin II as compared to those who received digitalis and diuretics alone. The addition of ACE-inhibitor therapy resulted in a decrease of angiotensin II, aldosterone, and vasopressin. Plasma catecholamines and ANF, however, did not change under the influence of cardiac medication. Diuretic treatment in NYHA class II patients reduced plasma volumes (p less than 0.01). Plasma volume in NYHA class IV patients only was found to be higher than in normal controls. Thus, analysis of the neurohumoral system can aid both in the identification of the clinical degree of dilated cardiomyopathy and in its optimal therapy.", 
    "75": "This study compared the antihypertensive effects and the haemodynamic mechanisms of action of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a beta-blocker and the combination of both in patients with mild to severe hypertension. After a placebo run-in period of 2 weeks, patients were treated for 3 weeks with each of the following: cilazapril (2.5 mg daily) and propranolol (120 mg daily), in a randomized sequence, and thereafter a combination of the two drugs. Blood pressure, cardiac output (measured by Doppler ultrasound) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) in a sitting position at rest were determined. One patient out of 18 was withdrawn in the cilazapril phase. Both monotherapies yielded significant and similar reductions of diastolic blood pressure (average -10 mmHg). Cardiac output and TPR showed opposite effects. Cardiac output was lower with the beta-blocker than with the ACE inhibitor (3.4 versus 4.5 l.min-1), while TPR behaved conversely (2646 versus 2005 dyne.s.cm-5). The combination of both drugs lowered diastolic blood pressure significantly more than the monotherapies (average -20 mmHg); the haemodynamic effects of the monotherapies were attenuated by the combination (cardiac output = 3.7 l.min-1; TPR = 2170 dyne.s.cm-5). A sitting diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 90 mmHg could be achieved in six out of 17 patients with propranolol alone, in eight out of 18 with cilazapril alone, and in 14 out of 17 with the coadministration of both drugs. The combination was better tolerated subjectively than the beta-blocker alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "This study was initiated to test the hypothesis that attenuation of long-term hypertension with or without regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) will lower minimal coronary vascular resistance (MCVR). Six-month-old spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated with captopril or hydralazine for a period of 3 mo. Myocardial perfusion, measured with microspheres, and hemodynamic data were obtained in awake, unrestrained rats aged 9 mo. MCVR was calculated from the quotient of mean/myocardial perfusion. Both drugs significantly lowered arterial systolic pressure in both strains of rats, but only captopril was effective in reducing heart mass. Left ventricular MCVR per 100 g was lower in captopril-treated WKY (0.064 +/- 0.012) and SHR (0.079 +/- 0.006) than the untreated controls (SHR: 0.124 +/- 0.006; WKY: 0.098 +/- 0.009), whereas total LV MCVR was unaltered by treatment. Hydralazine tended to lower LV MCVR per 100 g in both strains despite its tendency to increase ventricular mass. Captopril, but not hydralazine, treatment was associated with a significant increase in capillary density in both WKY and SHR. We conclude that the improvement in MCVR is related to both the regression of LVH and to the consequences of lowering arterial systolic pressure. In contrast, the increase in capillary density appears to be related to the decrease in ventricular mass after captopril treatment.", 
    "77": "To determine the influence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) on vascular smooth muscle tone, isolated human PMNLs (10(4)-10(7) cells/ml) were suspended in a tissue bath with precontracted rat aortic rings with or without endothelium. PMNLs in low concentrations (10(4) and 10(5) cells/ml) caused a mild contraction, and in higher concentrations (10(6) and 10(7) cells/ml) caused a modest relaxation of aortic rings with intact endothelium. In contrast, PMNLs caused a potent concentration-dependent relaxation of deendothelialized rings (P less than 0.01 compared with rings with intact endothelium). The PMNL-induced vascular smooth muscle relaxation was abolished by both hemoglobin and methylene blue and potentiated by both superoxide dismutase and captopril. Although suspension of PMNLs caused release of eicosanoids, thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin, from rings with intact endothelium, neither indomethacin nor the TxA2-endoperoxide receptor antagonist SQ 29548 modified the effects of PMNLs on vascular smooth muscle tone. These observations suggest that unstimulated PMNLs generate a smooth muscle relaxant, which has biological characteristics similar to the endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Since the activity of this PMNL-derived smooth muscle relaxant is more pronounced in deendothelialized vascular segments, it appears that endothelium provides a barrier against vasorelaxation by high concentrations of PMNLs.", 
    "78": "This study was investigated on the mechanism of the sedative state, tranquilization induced by bradykinin (BK) and kallikrein (KAL). The drugs used in this study were as follows: KAL as endogenous BK promoter; prostaglandins (PGs) as a material of analogous action of BK; indomethacin and mepacrine as the inhibitors of PG-synthesis; eugenol as the OH- scavenger and the PGE-synthesis potentiator; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor as BK potentiator B. All drugs were dissolved in Hartmann's solution (lactate Ringer's solution) and 10 microliters of solution was injected into the lateral ventricle of rats, according to the Myers' procedure. Then, the rat behavior was estimated, by means of monitoring spontaneous movement. A high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for detecting alteration of monoamines and prostaglandins in the rat brain on sedative state after BK or KAL injection.", 
    "79": "1) A 2-phase alteration of spontaneous movement was occurred within 30 min after BK or KAL icv-injection with behavioral specificity as follows: two exciting states and one sedative state. 2) A great increase of spontaneous movement evoked by BK or KAL was accompanied by exciting state as follows: jumping, wet dog response, struggle and scratching response, rearing and exploration. 3) A great decrease of spontaneous movement evoked by BK or KAL was accompanied with sedative state as follows: crouching with piloerection and closed eyes, catalepsy, preening and moisturizing and grooming. 4) PGE1 icv-injection was also carried out to clarify the involvement in the BK- or KAL-induced behavioral alteration. Consequently caused PGE1 the similar result to BK or KAL. 5) ACEI elongated and enhanced the exciting state or sedative state evoked by BK or KAL. 6) It was clear that BK reduced levels of monoamines in the rat hypothalamus: levels of norepinephrine(NE), epinephrine(E), dopamine(DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were decreased to 72.5%, 53.5%, 71.2% and 75.0% of control, respectively. Reduction of catecholamines in the hypothalamus was produced by increase of PGs and subsequently occurred sedative state of rats. 7) BK- or KAL-induced exciting state was enhanced by PG- synthesis inhibitor, especially the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, but the sedative state was weakened. On the contrary, eugenol, an OH- scavenger, elongated and intensified the sedative state. Detection with HPLC showed remarkable increase of levels of PGs in the rat brain during the sedative state: the level of PGE2 was 27.5% increase of control and the level of PGE2 alpha was also 54.8% increase of control, respectively.", 
    "80": "The norepinephrine (NE) release rate, determined in the pithed rat with stimulated sympathetic outflow (3 Hz), was calculated from the steady-state concentrations of endogenous NE and [3H]NE in the central venous pool after infusion of [3H]NE intraarterially (i.a.). This technique appropriately corrects for NE metabolism and disposition since the [3H]NE closely follows the removal path of neuronally released NE. Infusion of angiotensin II (AII) [0.1 microgram/kg/min, intravenously (i.v.)] failed to increase the NE release rate. A higher rate of infusion of AII (1.0 microgram/kg/min, i.v.) markedly increased the NE release rate. The converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (1 mg/kg, i.v.) and the AII-receptor blocking drug saralasin (10 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) decreased the NE release rate, indicating a tonic activation of facilitatory prejunctional AII receptors at sympathetic nerve endings. After bilateral nephrectomy, captopril and saralasin did not decrease the NE release rate. This suggests that renin release from the kidney is the primary determinant of AII effects and that local tissue generation of AII is not important Other differences were observed in nephrectomized rats: AII (0.1 microgram/kg/min, i.v.), in contrast to its lack of effect in rats with kidneys, increased the NE release rate. This suggests that the lack of effect of AII (0.1 microgram/kg/min, i.v.) on NE release in rats with kidneys may occur because facilitatory prejunctional AII receptors are maximally activated by endogenous AII.", 
    "81": "Tritium-labeled trandolaprilate (RU 44403), the active diacid form of the potent and long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril, has been evaluated as a new autoradiographic marker for the enzyme. The characteristics of 3H-trandolaprilate binding were first determined autoradiographically in tissue sections from rat brain (caudate-putamen) and kidney. 3H-Trandolaprilate binds saturably to these tissues, and with very high affinity (Kd values, 0.36 and 0.13 nM, respectively), and appears to show good selectivity for the enzyme. Due to its high affinity (approximately 100 times that of captopril), the performance of 3H-trandolaprilate as an autoradiographic marker is comparable to that of the recently described 125I-labeled derivative of lisinopril (125I-351A). Saturation and displacement studies in serial sections from a variety of central and peripheral tissues confirmed that the specificity of labeling was similar throughout. The anatomical distribution of ACE visualized with 3H-trandolaprilate in these tissues was close to that described for 3H-captopril and 125I-351A with some minor differences which might arise from difference in the specificity of the ligands.", 
    "82": "Inhibitors of the angiotensin conversion enzyme (ICE) represent an effective and well tolerated therapeutic class, for the treatment of arterial hypertension. The antihypertensive efficacy or perindopril, an ICE active in one single daily dose, is at least equal to that of reference antihypertensive drugs administered at usual doses. The possibility of occurrence of some side-effects while using ICE, has resulted in a particular attention in evaluating the safety of perindopril. First, the renal function was monitored. During essential hypertension, no significant variation of the creatininemia was observed with long-term administration of the drug (12 months). In elderly hypertensive patients or patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the glomerular filtration is also preserved, except during rare occurrences of decreased creatinine clearance, especially after adjunction of hydrochlorothiazide. A discrete elevation of the kaliemia without clinical significance is observed when perindopril is used as a single drug. Reports of symptomatic hypotension with perindopril are rare (0.2%), even in situations of water and sodium depletion. Among other side-effects of ICE, cough, more recent, was thoroughly investigated. Its frequency was determined during a double blind trial comparing perindopril (1.2%) with captopril (2.4%). It was also evaluated during a long-term study concerning 632 hypertensive patients (391 patients treated in 1 year); its incidence is the 2.9 p. cent and it resulted in discontinuation of the treatment in 8 cases. In this study, 36 patients interrupted the treatment prematurily because of an adverse reaction (5.7%). Finally no harmful drug interaction was reported. The favorable tolerance profile of perindopril is combined with a beneficial effect on the functional and structural modifications of the heart and large vessels related to hypertension.", 
    "83": "1. The effects of prolonged infusion of perindopril (1 mg/kg/d) were studied on Goldblatt rats and spontaneously hypertensive SHR rats compared to control animals. Perindopril increased significantly the arterial compliance in treated animals. Mechanical parameters of the carotid artery are normalized with perindopril infusion in renovascular hypertensive rats and improved in SHR rats. Perindopril reversed the thickness of aortic media in treated rats. After three months treatment the ratio elastine/collagen of the aortic media increased significantly. Perindopril reversed the majority of vascular alteration in both hypertensive groups. 2. Twenty one hypertensive patients received for 30 minutes an infusion of perindoprilat either at 1 mg/kg/min, or at 2.5 mg/kg/min, or dihydralazine at 4 mg/kg/min. It was shown that perindoprilat significantly reduced the blood pressure in the three groups. However the increase in arterial diameter and compliance were only recorded with perindoprilat (2.5 mg/kg/min) infusion. The results of this study pointed out that for the same antihypertensive effect, with two different antihypertensive drugs, the vascular effects can be different. Blood pressure, forearm hemodynamic parameters, echocardiography values were recorded on 16 sustained hypertensive patients before and after one year of perindopril treatment. The results showed that perindopril decreased significantly the SBP, DBP and the MBP, increased diameter and arterial compliance of the brachial artery, and decreased cardiac mass. Three months later, the treatment was stopped for four weeks: blood pressure and hemodynamic values returned toward basal values, whereas mass cardiac didn't increase significantly; then the treatment was continued over 9 months; during this period. The arterial compliance increased again on the cardiac mass remained reduced. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the long term antihypertensive effect of nicardipine in hypertensive patients with chronic renal disease. Eight patients (creatinine clearance ranging from 51 to 78 ml/min/1.73 m2) received nicardipine (20 mg t.i.d.). Four weeks later, patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg in recumbent position, were given enalapril (10 mg/day) as well. Blood pressure control was achieved in 3 patients treated with nicardipine alone and in 5 patients on a combined nicardipine-enalapril regimen, and it was maintained throughout the whole trial period (52 weeks). In two cases serum creatinine rose from 2.3 to 3.3 and from 1.4 to 2.2 respectively. However, the slope of the creatinine ratio, plotted against time, showed a significant reduction in renal function loss as compared to expected values. In conclusion, nicardipine, alone or in combination with enalapril, is an effective and well tolerated drug for use in treatment of hypertension secondary to chronic renal disease.", 
    "85": "It has been suggested that the metabolic side effects of antihypertensive drugs are responsible for their failure to reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with hypertension. Therefore, in 50 patients with essential hypertension, we performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing the effects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism of captopril (mean [+/- SD] dose, 81 +/- 24 mg per day) and hydrochlorothiazide (40 +/- 12 mg per day) over two four-month treatment periods. Captopril increased the insulin-mediated disposal of glucose, as compared with placebo, from 5.7 +/- 2.4 to 6.3 +/- 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute (P less than 0.05), whereas hydrochlorothiazide caused a decrease from 6.4 +/- 2.0 to 5.7 +/- 1.9 (P less than 0.01). Captopril had no effect on the basal insulin concentration, but it decreased the late (30- to 90-minute) insulin response to glucose and increased the early (2- to 6-minute) insulin peak. Hydrochlorothiazide increased the basal insulin concentration and the late insulin response to glucose. These findings may be explained by an increase in insulin sensitivity with captopril and a decrease with hydrochlorothiazide. Little or no change was seen in serum lipid or lipoprotein levels during treatment with captopril, whereas hydrochlorothiazide caused significant increases in serum total (5 percent) and low-density lipoprotein (6 percent) cholesterol levels and total (15 percent) and very-low-density lipoprotein (25 percent) triglyceride levels, as compared with placebo (P less than 0.01 for all comparisons). We conclude that hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of essential hypertension has adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. It is possible, but not proved in this study, that these changes may contribute to the risk for diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. In contrast, captopril appears to have beneficial or no effects on glucose and lipid metabolism.", 
    "86": "Nifedipine reduces blood pressure predominantly by reducing systemic vascular resistance due to a direct vasodilating action on the arterioles. This peripheral vasodilation appears greater the more severe the hypertension. Studies have demonstrated an additive effect of beta blockers and converting-enzyme inhibitors in patients not controlled with nifedipine alone. Although there is a controversy about whether diuretics have an additive effect on blood pressure in patients already taking nifedipine, it would appear that the blood pressure-lowering effect of thiazide is blunted. Studies have shown that a high sodium intake may enhance the acute blood pressure-lowering effect of nifedipine. Nifedipine does cause a long-term reduction in sodium balance.", 
    "87": "The relation between hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure in the elderly is well established. The concept that this was entirely due to hardening of the arteries and, therefore, an essential feature of aging has been revised in the last 15 years to show that there are groups of elderly people in whom hypertension is not a problem, and in this group stroke disease and heart failure are relatively uncommon. The treatment of hypertension in the elderly attracts increasing attention. The successful lowering of blood pressure in the elderly has now been reported by many authors with a variety of therapeutic agents. The case for treatment has been demonstrated in those up to 80 years of age by the European Working Party in Hypertension in the Elderly, and relevant data on compliance are also available in the older age group in the Sub-Group Analysis of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Programme. A similar reduction of blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, can be safely achieved with thiazides, beta-blockade, calcium channel blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and centrally acting drugs. The differentiation between these groups is largely a matter of the side effects that occur and any concurrent existing illness from which the patient suffers, e.g., diabetes, bronchitis, heart failure, and so on. From the information available to date, the problem of choice of the most suitable drug remains a clinical decision for the prescribing doctor.", 
    "88": "The acute renal excretory actions of several antihypertensive agents were assessed in healthy volunteers. Rilmenidine (1 mg) did not affect water and electrolyte balance. Beta-adrenergic blockers had little effect upon urinary composition, whereas diuretics caused significant urinary losses of fluid, sodium, potassium, and magnesium as expected. The vasodilators ketanserin and flosequinan did not affect water and electrolyte excretion. Ketanserin increased urate output in common with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which may act as facultative diuretics. Combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (100 mg) or rilmenidine (1 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) had little influence upon the known actions of the diuretic. When the beta-blocker pindolol (10 mg) was given with the diuretic clopamide (5 mg), beneficial effects were noted; potassium and magnesium losses were markedly reduced, whereas the natriuretic and diuretic effects of clopamide were unchanged. These short-term studies in healthy volunteers provide useful pointers to some possible pharmacodynamic effects of antihypertensive drugs in patients.", 
    "89": "The respective prevalence of hypertension and asthma is sufficient for their combined existence to be far from rare. The effects of certain antihypertensive drugs, e.g., alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, on the bronchi may be either harmful or beneficial. When inhaled, alpha 2-agonists reduce the immediate bronchial response to allergens, whereas when ingested they aggravate the bronchial response to histamine and all the more so when their effect on the central nervous system is greater. Therefore, there has been much interest in agents such as the new oxazoline derivative, rilmenidine, which has less central effects than clonidine, an imidazoline compound of reference. Calcium antagonists inhibit smooth muscle contraction and release of mast cell inflammatory mediators. In asthmatic subjects, their short-term administration leads to a modest improvement in spontaneous bronchial obstruction, has only a partial protective action against various nonspecific or allergenic stimuli, and slightly reinforces the beneficial effect of beta 2-agonists. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists aggravate bronchial obstruction and nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity in asthmatic subjects. These harmful effects are dose-dependent, have even been reported after the administration of eyedrops, and are common to all beta-blockers. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase bronchial hyperreactivity in patients who develop cough during treatment and may, in certain cases, worsen or even induce asthma, probably by opposing inactivation by hydrolysis of tachykinins and of bradykinins.", 
    "90": "Two cases of enalapril(Reniten)-induced angioedema are described. In both patients the time lag between the first manifestation of angio-edema and diagnosis was more than one year, during which several bouts of edema occurred. One patient developed life-threatening swelling of the tongue and the larynx followed by asystole and apnea. The second patient had recurrent edema of the tongue and dyspnea. In general, enalapril-induced edema is not thought to be based on immunological mechanisms. However, in both patients we found elevated titres of antinuclear antibodies, which were reversible upon cessation of enalapril medication. The possible pathomechanisms are discussed.", 
    "91": "This study examines the relation between the change in clinical status and the change in plasma norepinephrine concentration in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) receiving standard medical therapy. Hemodynamic measurements in 11 patients with CHF (ejection fraction 19 +/- 4%) were obtained before and immediately after the administration of digoxin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Patients were then followed for 1 year. Clinical status was determined using the Boston Clinical Heart Failure scoring system. Of the 11 patients, 6 demonstrated significant clinical improvement after therapy, based on the Boston score, over a 1-year period. Five patients did not respond to therapy: 4 died and the remaining patient had worsening CHF. There was no difference between responders and nonresponders in either baseline hemodynamics or acute response to the administration of digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In the patients who improved, plasma norepinephrine decreased from 706 +/- 235 to 545 +/- 223 pg/ml (p = 0.08) after 1 year of medical therapy. In patients whose CHF worsened or who died, plasma norepinephrine increased from 715 +/- 275 at baseline to 1,237 +/- 671 pg/ml at their last measurement (p = 0.06). Although at baseline the plasma norepinephrine levels were similar in both groups of patients, a significant difference between responders and nonresponders was observed at final follow-up (p less than 0.002). Change in plasma norepinephrine correlated with change in CHF score (r = 0.79, p less than 0.004). Thus, in patients with CHF, serial measurements of plasma norepinephrine correlate with changes in clinical status.", 
    "92": "Binding of the potent radiolabelled competitive inhibitor 3H RU 44403 to pure human kidney angiotensin-I converting enzyme was examined in equilibrium and non equilibrium conditions. Equilibrium dialysis experiments indicate that, despite the duplicated structure of the enzyme and the presence of two putative active sites, 3H RU 44403 interacts with a single high affinity (Kd = 0.44 +/- 0.05 x 10-9 M, n = 3) binding site. This suggests that only one of the two putative active sites is functional, and can bind substrates or inhibitors. Sodium chloride plays an essential role in the enzyme-inhibitor interaction. The formation of the complex is only slightly influenced by NaCl, but the kinetic of dissociation is dramatically dependent on NaCl concentration. In a Nacl free medium the complex is unstable and dissociates rapidly. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chloride ion influences isomerization of the complex toward a more stable form.",

Clinically, ACE inhibitors reduce systemic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease without causing dramatic changes in glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow. Most studies of nondiabetic renal insufficiency suggest that proteinuria is reduced in most patients. However, no long-term controlled study on the effect of ACE inhibitors on the progression rate of nondiabetic renal disease has been completed. ACE inhibitors have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating or preventing progressive renal disease. Such use would therefore be considered \"innovative\" therapy.",

Patients with bilateral renal insufficiency or low cardiac output are at increased risk for developing reversible acute renal insufficiency. Hyperkalemia may occur, particularly in patients with diabetes or severe renal insufficiency. In many patients with renal disease, ACE inhibitors dramatically reduce proteinuria, but whether they also reduce the rate of progression of renal disease remains unproved.", 
    "98": "A kinin-potentiating peptide (KPP) generated from human plasma proteins on trypsin incubation was partially purified by ultrafiltration and ion-exchange chromatography and was characterized through some of its pharmacological properties. KPP itself was devoid of any action but it potentiated the guinea-pig ileum contractions elicited by several kinins, including an analog resistant to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In contrast, contractions induced by angiotensin II, histamine, acetylcholine, barium chloride and substance P were not potentiated. Not only did KPP have high specificity towards kinins, but its action started immediately and induced kinin potentiation in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Furthermore KPP potentiated the bradykinin contracting effects on the rat uterus, a preparation with very poor ACE activity, and on guinea-pig ileum previously incubated with 1.10-phenanthroline, a metal chelator able to inhibit ACE and kininase I activities and with phosphoramidon, a specific inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The results suggest that the potentiating effect of KPP is due to a mechanism different from the inhibition of kinin metabolism by ACE, NEP and kininase I.", 
    "99": "The results and immediate complications of oral administration of 6.25 mg captopril in 47 patients with arterial hypertension are described. The blood pressure was measured every 15 minutes for 90 minutes and the plasma renin concentration was measured before the test and at the conclusion of the test. Eleven of the patients had stenosis of the renal arteries. This investigation rendered it possible to differentiate this group from other patients with hypertension from other causes. Patients with renovascular hypertension had thus significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure and significant increase in plasma renin concentration in contrast to the remaining patients. Seven patients developed cerebral symptoms in connection with the decrease in blood pressure. Angiographic examination in two of these patients revealed stenosis of the vessels in the neck. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be avoided in patients with recognized poor cerebral circulation or murmurs over the vessels in the neck.", 
    "100": "Favourable results with the use of inhibitors of the angiotension I-converting enzyme in the therapy not only of high-renin but also normo-renin and low-renin hypertension revived interest in research in the area of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) system. The use of classical radioimmunological, radiohistochemical receptor studies as well as of recent methods of molecular biology and pathology revealed that for the regulation of blood pressure and the extracellular volume and pathogenesis of hypertension not only RAS components in systemic blood are important but also local tissue RAS with an autocrine and paracrine action at the site of its origin. Cerebral RAS participates in the central cardiovascular regulation, in the control of the salt and water intake, the secretion of antidiuretic hormone and ACTH. In the cardiovascular apparatus RAS is responsible not only for vasoconstriction but it acts also as a growth factor promoting the development of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy. In the kidneys RAS decides on the blood flow, its distribution, glomerular filtration. Its excessive stimulation may contribute in arterial hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and in residual nephrons during chronic renal failure, to the change from functional hyperfiltration to irreversible structural damage of the nephron. Inhibitors of the converting enzyme not only reduce the peripheral vascular resistance in arterial hypertension but influence also the tissue production of angiotensin II and thus the regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy and progression of renal damage.",

    "102": "Camostat mesilate, a developed derivative of gabexate mesilate for oral use, was administered in a daily dose of 600 mg for 4 weeks to 17 patients with heavy proteinuria due to various nephropathies. Five patients had glomerulonephritis (3 patients with IgA nephropathy, one each with membranoproliferative GN and membranous nephropathy) and 3 had systemic vasculitis. These patients had been treated with glucocorticoid, cyclophosphamide, anticoagulants, and dipyridamole. Five patients had diabetic nephropathy and had been treated with conventional therapy including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Two cases with benign nephrosclerosis, one with Alport syndrome, and the rest with end-stage renal failure of undetermined cause were also included in this study. Urinary protein decreased promptly within 2 weeks (from 5.2 +/- 0.7 to 3.5 +/- 0.5, mean +/- SE, p less than 0.005), and serum total protein and albumin levels increased significantly. Serum creatinine levels did not change. Decreases in urinary protein excretion of more than 50% were observed in five out of eight patients with glomerulonephritis or systemic vasculitis, two out of five with diabetic nephropathy, and one with chronic renal failure. However, urinary protein excretion values remained at the same level in two patients with benign nephrosclerosis and a patient with Alport syndrome. We suggest that camostat mesilate caused a change in glomerular capillary permeability for macromolecules through its inhibitory effects on the kallikrein-kinin system, complement system, coagulation system, and platelet function, which contributed to the treatment of the various nephropathies.", 
    "103": "A series of 1-benzylimidazole-5-acetate derivatives defining the critical substituents on the phenyl ring was synthesized in order to improve on the affinity of 2-butyl-4-chloro-1-(2-nitrobenzyl)imidazole-5-acetate, sodium (S-8308) for the angiotensin II (AII) receptor. The analogs, substituted with -1-(4-carboxybenzyl) (EXP6155),-1-[4-(2-carboxybenzamido)benzyl] (EXP6159) and the 5-methylacetate of EXP6159 (EXP6803), were found to inhibit the binding of [3H]AII to AII receptors in rat adrenal cortical microsomes with 9-, 35- and 107-fold higher affinity, respectively, than that of S-8308 (IC50, 15 X 10(-6) microM). Scatchard analysis of the [3H]AII binding revealed that in the presence of EXP6155 (10(-6) M), the dissociation constant for AII was increased from 1.2 to 3.9 X 10(-9) M, whereas the total number of binding sites remained unchanged, suggesting a competitive nature of antagonism. A similar order of affinity or potency (saralasin much greater than EXP6803 greater than EXP6159 greater than EXP6155 greater than S8308) was observed in various in vitro and in vivo assays: rat smooth muscle cells AII binding, 45Ca++ influx in rat aortic rings, contractile response in isolated rabbit aorta and AII-induced pressor response in anesthetized rats. Responses (45Ca++ and contraction) elicited by norepinephrine or by KCl were unaltered by these agents at concentrations of up to 10(-4) M. In addition, they exerted no direct effect on the activity of rabbit angiotensin converting enzyme and rat renin.

    "104": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as antihypertensives has increased rapidly since the introduction of captopril in 1981. Seven cases of neonatal renal failure have been reported in patients with exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that continued to the time of delivery. Two cases resulted in death of the newborn; the other five patients recovered after peritoneal dialysis. Because the relative frequency of normal outcomes is unknown, these data are insufficient for incidence-rate estimates or risk/benefit analyses. However, given the potential neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with late-pregnancy exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alternative therapies in the third trimester should be given consideration. If these drugs must be used in this context, the clinician should be prepared to deal with renal failure and hypotension in the newborn. The Food and Drug Administration invites reports of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with such exposure.",

The age of the patient ranged from 5.5 to 13 years (mean 9.3 years). Four children, served as control group, received digitalis and diuretics as standard treatment; while the other 4 children also received 2 x 12.5 mg of captopril in addition to standard treatment. The effect of both regimens were measured by using changes of left ventricular function as seen on the echocardiogram performed before treatment, and then 3, 7 and 14 days thereafter. Definite conclusion cannot be made because of the small number of patients; but it is apparent that some improvements of left ventricular functions in the captopril group were more evident when compared with that of the control group of standard treatment. Side effects of captopril were not found.",

Were included in the study hypertensive patients with previous antihypertensive therapy or when in the course of any previous antihypertensive treatment (52.4%) blood pressure control were not observed and side effects compromised patient's compliance. Captopril 25 mg/day was used once a day as single dose or subdivided in two daily doses (12.5 mg b.i.d.), during 30 days. If blood pressure was not normalized or dyastolic blood pressure drop was not equal or bigger than 10% after this period, it was added hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day. After three months under treatment, 411 (87%) patients normalized their dyastolic blood pressure DBP (less than 90 mmHg), from them, 273 (57.6%) had received only captopril and the others 138 (29.4%) with the addition of hydrochlorothiazide. The drop of mean arterial pressure, MAP = 2 DBP + 1 SBP was in average, 17.3 mmHg, in the 3 patients whose blood pressure normalized with captopril alone, and in average of 18.5 mmHg in those patients requiring addition of hydrochlorothiazide (difference without statistical significance). A small decrease of body weight, but with statistical significance (p less than 0.001) were observed during the use of captopril as monotherapy. Expressive reduction of side effects were observed during the period under captopril related to the period with previous antihypertensive therapy.",

After 1 month of placebo, the patients were treated with 50 mg captopril twice a day for the following 6 months. Blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion were significantly reduced but no relationship was found between these two variables. No changes were detected in the renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, renal vascular resistance or metabolic pattern. Captopril significantly reduced blood pressure and albuminuria without any change in the renal function. The decrease in albuminuria may be related to the reduction in blood pressure as well as to a direct effect of captopril on glomerular haemodynamics.",

Captopril (37.5-75 mg/day) was administered for 8 weeks. Fourteen of the 19 patients in whom captopril was effective took a treadmill exercise test according to Kattus' protocol. Exercise tolerance was increased in all patients (from 13.1 +/- 1.3 to 16.5 +/- 1.0 min, P less than 0.01). Captopril attenuated the rise in blood pressure during the exercise test but did not affect the heart rate. Resting values of plasma adrenaline decreased by 47% and noradrenaline by 17%, with no significant changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) or aldosterone. The change in mean blood pressure showed an inverse relationship to pretreatment plasma noradrenaline (r = -0.73, P less than 0.01). The results show that captopril is effective in the treatment of hypertensive elderly patients, and suggest that the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the mechanism of the antihypertensive response to captopril therapy.",

When compared with standard triple therapy, captopril slowed the progression of renal failure. Captopril was also able to reduce the proteinuria of non-diabetic glomerular origin. This reduction was not dependent on the presence or absence of arterial hypertension but was limited by the presence of low serum albumin levels, and only occurred in patients with proteinuria in excess of 3 g/24 h.", 
    "111": "Systemic hypertension accelerates the progression of glomerular injury. Studies in experimental animals indicate that the beneficial effects of antihypertensive agents may relate to their intrarenal haemodynamic consequences, and specifically to their effects on the arteriolar resistances. Relative afferent arteriolar vasodilation allows transmission of systemic pressure into the glomerular capillary network; the resultant glomerular capillary hypertension is associated with progressive structural injury. Antihypertensive agents, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, relax the efferent arteriole, alleviate glomerular hypertension and protect the kidney from progressive injury. These agents are effective in numerous animal models, and preliminary clinical observations suggest that they may also be effective in humans. In contrast, vasodilator/diuretic regimens are effective in some animal models, but fail to reduce glomerular pressure or injury in others. Less is known about the potential renal protective effects of calcium channel blockers, with reported observations offering conflicting findings. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to define the optimal antihypertensive therapy for patients at risk of glomerular injury.", 
    "112": "Hypertension is an important risk factor in the progression of renal failure, particularly in patients with pre-existing glomerulopathies such as diabetes and chronic glomerulonephritis. The mechanisms involved in hypertensive glomerular injury are currently unclear and cannot be studied in humans because of the constraints of human experimentation. However, recent animal studies have elucidated mechanisms which may explain the variable relationship between systemic hypertension and glomerular injury. Experimentally, at similar levels of systemic hypertension, glomerular injury only develops when preglomerular resistances are ineffective, thus allowing the development of glomerular hypertension. The mechanisms by which the haemodynamic stress of elevated intracapillary pressures and flows lead to progressive glomerular damage are at present unknown. Endothelial cell injury, increased mesangial traffic and/or trapping of macromolecules and epithelial cell injury appear to occur early, followed by in situ inflammatory and microthrombotic mechanisms. The intrarenal renin-angiotensin system appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of progressive glomerular injury. Haemodynamically, angiotensin II (Ang II) has a relatively greater vasoconstrictive effect on efferent than on afferent arterioles. In addition, Ang II decreases the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. These combined effects result in increased intraglomerular capillary pressures. Angiotensin II increases the uptake and decreases the egress of circulating macromolecules in the glomerular mesangium and fosters mesangial cell mitogenesis. Thus, inhibition of Ang II generation may explain why angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be effective in arresting or slowing the progression of renal failure in experimental animals and in man.", 
    "113": "The unique ability of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to inhibit the generation of angiotensin II has made them very useful agents for treating patients with renovascular hypertension. Their efficacy in lowering blood pressure in this type of secondary hypertension is now well established. However, episodes of acute renal failure may occur during ACE inhibition, particularly when renal perfusion is compromised. This is often the case in patients with renal artery stenosis and a single kidney or with bilateral renal artery stenosis. In recent years, investigators have shown concern at the long-term fate of the stenotic kidney in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis who are treated with ACE inhibitors. Although overall renal function remained stable, a decrease in glomerular filtration was demonstrated in the stenotic kidney under ACE inhibition. The long-term implications of this observation merit further investigations.",

There was a significant increase in pulmonary blood flow time (Tp), pulmonary blood volume (BVp). mean pulmonary pressure (MPP), and total pulmonary resistance (TPR). as regarded as initial signs of heart failure, in group 1 that comprised 35 patients out of 65 after a graded isometric loading test. After prazosin therapy, these patients showed a significant decrease in blood pressure, only moderate reduction in MPP and TPR, and a rise of the cardiac index (CI). There was a significant decrease in Tp, BVp, MPP, TPR during the loading test following the therapy. From group 2, 23 patients were treated with capoten. The monotherapy was beneficial in 9 patients, capoten was discontinued in 1 case; 13 patients received a combined therapy with glycosides and saluretics.

Furthermore, these drugs have been associated with a persistent dry cough in subjects without previous known bronchial hyper-reactivity. There is reason to believe that an ACE inhibitor-induced cough is due to an increased inflammatory state in the airways of susceptible individuals, and that this cough might thereby have pathophysiological features in common with the cough seen as an early symptom of asthma. All inflammatory responses, wheal and flare reactions, infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes were enhanced by ACE inhibitors. A dose-response relationship for the proinflammatory effect of the ACE inhibitor has been demonstrated.", 
    "116": "As previously reported, pretreatment with captopril significantly enhanced pleural exudation of rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy. However, in high molecular weight kininogen-deficient rats (B/N-Katholiek), the pleural exudate volume was significantly less than that of the normal strain (B/N-Kitasato), and captopril pretreatment did not enhance exudation. In the present study, the following additional evidences were demonstrated: 1) Captopril did not increase 6-keto-PGF1 alpha level in the deficient strain, but it was significantly increased in the normal strain after captopril treatment; 2) simultaneous administration of soybean trypsin inhibitor with carrageenin markedly suppressed the exudate volume and levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the normal strain; and 3) indomethacin also suppressed pleural fluid accumulation and the production of arachidonate metabolites. These data suggest that carrageenin causes intrinsic kinin-release through the activation of plasma kallikrein and then in turn, the kinin stimulates the production of arachidonic acid metabolites. Thus these products and kinin may interact to induce more plasma exudation in carrageenin inflammation. The results also indicate that captopril uncovers the effects of bradykinin on exudation and stimulation of arachidonate metabolite production; otherwise, the biological effect of kinin is too slight to produce a clear effect at the initial phase of the inflammation.", 
    "117": "The traditional stepped-care approach to antihypertensive therapy, which progresses from simple low-dose monotherapy with diuretics and/or beta-blockers to complex combined regimens, is credited with reduction of hypertension-related stroke morbidity and mortality. However, it has achieved little success in reducing hypertension-related coronary morbidity and mortality. Overall mortality of treated hypertensive patients has remained higher than that of the general population, despite decreases in the blood pressure. In the 1990s, hypertension will be viewed as one of several cardiovascular risk factors requiring individualized treatment that takes concomitant diseases into account. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that do not adversely affect serum lipid and glucose levels will play a major role. This class of drugs will also receive attention because of its beneficial action on diabetic nephropathy and its promising cardioprotective effect achieved by improved coronary blood flow, prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy and prevention of certain potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.", 
    "118": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the only therapeutic agents used in the treatment of chronic heart failure that have been shown to both improve symptoms and prolong life. These agents produce long-term haemodynamic and clinical benefits in about 60-65% of patients. The only reliable means of determining which patients are most likely to respond favourably to treatment is by a therapeutic trial; the response cannot be predicted by demographic factors, pretreatment left ventricular function or plasma renin activity. In addition to their symptomatic benefits, ACE inhibitors reduce the mortality of patients with chronic heart failure, possibly by decreasing ventricular wall stress and decreasing the frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias. The most serious adverse effects of treatment, hypotension, functional renal insufficiency and potassium retention, occur most commonly in patients with the most advanced disease [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV heart failure] and when efforts are made to block the formation of angiotensin (Ang) II continuously (as with the use of long-acting ACE inhibitors). The unique characteristics of the ACE inhibitors support their use as first-line agents in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "119": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are useful in the treatment of hypertension. However, acute renal deterioration may occur in some conditions where angiotensin plays a crucial role in the regulation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), such as volume depletion, severe stenosis of both renal arteries and stenosis of the renal artery of a single functioning kidney. Acute renal failure induced by ACE inhibition may develop without a reduction in systemic blood pressure it is enhanced by prior sodium depletion and is reversible when treatment is withdrawn. The relative superiority of ACE inhibitors in slowing the progression of chronic parenchymal renal disease remains to be demonstrated, although promising results have been reported in patients with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "120": "The clearance of drugs excreted entirely unchanged by the kidneys is assumed to relate directly to renal function. The clearance of drugs which are entirely metabolized is usually not altered in patients with renal impairment, although there are examples of both increased and decreased metabolic clearance rates. The clearance of metabolites which are excreted unchanged through the kidneys is also directly related to renal function. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enalapril, ramipril, cilazapril and quinapril are prodrugs that are rapidly converted to active metabolites which are excreted unchanged through the kidneys. Studies have consistently demonstrated reduction in the apparent oral clearance of the active metabolites, in proportion to the degree of impairment of renal function. In addition, for quinapril at least, the metabolic clearance of the parent drug is slightly reduced in renal impairment. The activity of captopril and lisinopril lies in the parent molecule itself. Lisinopril is excreted renally unchanged, while captopril is both metabolized and excreted renally unchanged. The duration of ACE inhibition after administration of any of the ACE inhibitors is prolonged in proportion to the degree of renal impairment. From these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, it follows that the dose rate of the ACE inhibitors should be reduced in direct proportion to the degree of reduction in renal function. Reducing the dose, rather than prolonging the dose interval, is more logical for compliance and for maintaining a consistent degree of ACE inhibition over 24 h.", 
    "121": "Drug treatment of hypertension reduces morbidity and mortality most effectively in moderate to severe cases. However, most patients have only mild hypertension, for which traditional drug treatment is not consistently successful. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provide superior control of mild hypertension. They have a haemodynamically favourable mechanism of action, are well tolerated and can produce a predictable response within a narrow and convenient dose range. Further, ACE inhibitors are lipidneutral, and they positively affect some of the mechanisms conducive to the development of atherosclerosis. Further research in this area is warranted. The ACE inhibitors may also help prevent end-organ damage in hypertensive patients who also have diabetes, kidney disease, left ventricular hypertrophy or a combination of these disorders. The case for renoprotection in diabetic hypertensives is strong enough to recommend preferential use of ACE inhibitors for these patients. The positive effects shown in left ventricular hypertrophy may also be produced by other modern antihypertensive agents, while the advantages of ACE inhibitors in essential hypertension with renal damage remain largely conjectural. There have been encouraging clinical results, but ongoing larger trials may provide a more definitive answer.", 
    "122": "1. The authors elaborated an original concept for the interpretation of vasomotor disorders in subjects with an artificial heart. 2. This concept is based on the regeneration of nervous elements in the walls of the atria (in particular the right one) after implantation of the artificial heart and on comparison of their activity with the venous pressure which revealed the interrelationship of the two phenomena. 3. Both therapeutic methods based on this concept, the method of influencing the afferentation and efferentation of vasomotor nervous regulations leading to a reduction of the central venous pressure proved valid and effective. 4. Evaluation of the effectiveness of this therapy is based on regular assessment of the central venous pressure, on the laboratory assay of enzymes (AST, ALT, GMT and LDH), on the assessment of serum albumin and finally on the morphological and histological examination of the liver incl. assessment of the hepatic index. 5. The nervous pathogenesis is closely linked with hormonal factors. The latter are conceived as the participation of associated factors in the pathogenesis of venous hypertension in recipients with an artificial heart.", 
    "123": "1. The effects of the inhibitors of endopeptidase EC 24.11, thiorphan and phosphoramidon administered i.c.v. (40 micrograms kg-1) i.p. (400 micrograms kg-1), or orally (400 micrograms kg-1), on intestinal motor activity in fed rats was compared to the effects of similar doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril and the synthetic enkephalin analogue [D-Ala2 Met5] enkephalinamide (Dalamide). Drugs were administered alone or after pretreatment with naloxone or N-methyl levallorphan (300 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) given 10 min prior to gavage with a standard meal. 2. In control conditions, in the duodenum, the disruption of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) by gavage with a standard meal lasted between 105.6 and 119.1 min. This duration was significantly decreased by thiorphan (60.3 +/- 15.0 min), phosphoramidon (67.9 +/- 7.3 min), captopril (26.3 +/- 10.2 min) and Dalamide (42.4 +/- 9.6 min), administered i.c.v. 3. In contrast, after the i.p. administration of thiorphan, phosphoramidon and Dalamide the delay in the return of the MMC pattern was increased. Such an effect was also seen after the oral administration of phosphoramidon or Dalamide. Neither i.p. nor oral captopril administration altered the duration of postprandial pattern. 4. A prior treatment with naloxone i.p. (300 micrograms kg-1) that had no effect per se, antagonized the effect produced by i.c.v. administration of thiorphan, phosphoramidon or Dalamide, but failed to reverse the effect of captopril. In contrast, i.p. administration of N-methyl levallorphan (300pgkg-1) did not affect the response induced by central administration of thiorphan, phosphoramidon, captopril or Dalamide, but was able to prevent that of thiorphan, phosphoramidon or Dalamide when they were administered i.p. or orally. 5. These data strongly support the hypothesis of a dual control by endogenous opioids of intestinal motility in the rat: a central component that favours, and a peripheral control that delays the occurrence of the MMC profile in fed rats.", 
    "124": "1. Standard microelectrode techniques were used to study the effects of captopril (1, 10 and 100 microM) on action potentials recorded from guinea-pig ventricular cells and sinoatrial node cells. 2. Captopril had no effect on the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) of ventricular action potentials in cells exposed to either normal Locke solution or 'simulated ischaemic' solution (K1 11.2 mM; pH-6.4; PO2 less than 80 mmHg), nor was there any augmentation of the normal small decline in Vmax with increasing stimulation rate (range of interstimulus intervals = 2400 ms to 300 ms). 3. Captopril had no effect on the duration of ventricular action potentials, nor did it alter the shortening seen on exposure to simulated ischaemia. 4. Captopril did not alter spontaneous sinus cycle length or any recorded parameter of sinus node action potentials. 5. It is concluded that any antiarrhythmic effects observed during clinical use of captopril are most unlikely to be due to direct actions of the drug on cardiac cell membrane properties.", 
    "125": "The purpose of the present study was to characterize the etiology of bilateral perinephritis hypertension in the non-human primate. Hypertension was induced in female cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys by wrapping both kidneys under sterile surgical procedures. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (ALDO), para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine volume, and sodium and potassium excretion were measured before and weekly after induction of the hypertension. MAP increased progressively from 108 +/- 1 to 135 +/- 4 mmHg during the first 6 weeks; thereafter, MAP remained at this elevated level, PRA was elevated two- to fivefold for up to 10 weeks after the hypertension and ALDO was elevated during 1 (139%), 4 (60%), 6 (196%), 8 (249%) and 10 (148%) weeks of the hypertension. PAH clearance and GFR were significantly reduced during week 1 of the hypertension, but returned to control values by week 2. Urine volume was increased significantly during the first week of the hypertension, while sodium and potassium excretion were not changed. Captopril (15 mumol/kg, intravenously) normalized the blood pressure regardless of the severity or duration of the disease. Additionally, captopril lowered ALDO and increased PRA. It is concluded that bilateral perinephritis hypertension in the monkey is dependent on increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.", 
    "126": "We studied the expression of kidney renin gene in hypertensive animals by measuring the kidney renin messenger (m) RNA. The kidney renin mRNA was quantified by densitometric Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labelled rat renin genomic DNA fragment as a hybridization probe. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were treated with a low-sodium diet plus furosemide, captopril or propranolol for a week. Plasma renin activity (PRA) in SHR and WKY was increased similarly by sodium depletion and by treatment with captopril. PRA in both strains was not decreased significantly by treatment with propranolol. Both sodium depletion and captopril treatment caused significant increases in the kidney renin mRNA in SHR and WKY. However, the increases in the kidney renin mRNA of SHR were greater than those in the corresponding WKY (SHR, 10.0- and 22.1-fold increases; WKY, 6.2- and 7.8-fold increases, respectively). Propranolol had no effect on the kidney renin gene expression in either WKY or SHR. These results indicate that SHR show an enhanced expression of the renin gene in the kidney compared with WKY in response to stimuli that increase renin release.", 
    "127": "The whole-day blood pressure response to once-daily and twice-daily administration of a combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide was measured in a study of elderly patients (aged 59 to 78 years) with mild to moderate hypertension. Whole-day automated ambulatory blood pressure profiles were obtained at baseline, after 8 weeks of therapy with a combination of 25 mg of captopril and 15 mg of hydrochlorothiazide twice daily, and again after 8 weeks of once-daily therapy with 50 mg of captopril and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Average systolic and diastolic whole-day blood pressures significantly decreased from baseline during both twice-daily treatment (mean +/- SEM change, 18 [+/- 3]/10 [+/- 2] mm Hg) and once-daily treatment (11 [+/- 2]/9 [+/- 1] mm Hg). While the decrease in systolic blood pressure during once-daily therapy was less than that during twice-daily therapy for the group as a whole, 16 of 19 patients achieved normal systolic (less than 140 mm Hg) and diastolic (less than 90 mm Hg) blood pressures throughout the day during the once-daily regimen. During once-daily therapy, the blood pressure reductions were sustained throughout the 24-hour period, and were not attenuated during the final 2 to 4 hours before the next dose. A subgroup of 5 patients were identified who appeared unresponsive to both twice-daily and once-daily antihypertensive treatment. Despite hypertensive office-measured blood pressures at entry to the study, 4 of these 5 patients actually had normotensive whole-day blood pressure averages at baseline (mean, 131 [+/- 7]/81 [+/- 4] mm Hg). Thus, whole-day ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a valuable tool for testing treatment responses. It demonstrated that once-daily treatment with low doses of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide was as effective as twice-daily administration in decreasing diastolic pressures throughout the day, but was slightly less effective in decreasing systolic pressures. Additionally, the monitoring identified apparently normotensive patients in whom treatment may not be indicated.", 
    "128": "We examined whether the increase in baroreceptor reflex function previously reported in lifetime - captopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was due to an inhibition of brain angiotensin II mechanisms. Pregnant and lactating SHR were given oral captopril (100 mg/kg/day). After weaning, pups were maintained on captopril (50 mg/kg/day) until the study (19-21 weeks). Control rats received tap water. One week before study captopril-treated and control SHR were given an intracerebroventricular infusion of angiotensin II (7.5 ng/hr, osmotic pump) or vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid). Baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate was assessed by the slope of the relation between the change in mean arterial pressure (mm Hg) versus the change in pulse interval (msec beat-1). Arterial pressure was raised or lowered by intravenous bolus injections of phenylephrine or nitroprusside, respectively. Central infusion of angiotensin II had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure in captopril or control SHR (captopril-angiotensin II 125 +/- 4 vs. captopril-vehicle 121 +/- 2; control-angiotensin II 169 +/- 5 vs. control-vehicle 173 +/- 7 mm Hg), but it produced a significant rise in basal heart rate (captopril-angiotensin II 371 +/- 10 vs. captopril-vehicle 323 +/- 8, p less than 0.0002; control-angiotensin II 338 +/- 7 vs. control-vehicle 312 +/- 8 beats/min, p less than 0.0183) and in daily water intake (captopril-angiotensin II 20.7 +/- 2.2 vs. captopril-vehicle 9.8 +/- 0.7, p less than 0.0426; control-angiotensin II 33.1 +/- 3.8 vs. control-vehicle 9.0 +/- 0.6 ml/100 g body wt, p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "129": "Renovascular hypertension is a potentially curable form of high blood pressure. However, it is unclear how best to select patients who are likely to have renovascular hypertension, what diagnostic strategy to use in these selected patients, and how to predict the hemodynamic significance of a renal artery stenosis. We determined the prevalence of renovascular hypertension in adults who exhibited suggestive clinical features. In these clinically selected patients, we then determined the test characteristics of various diagnostic and potential screening tests. Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed if correction of renal artery stenosis resulted in decreased blood pressure. Of the 66 hypertensive adults evaluated, 11 (16.7%) had renovascular hypertension. Captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity detected renovascular hypertension with 73% sensitivity, 72% specificity, 38% positive predictive value, and 92% negative predictive value. Less optimal combinations of sensitivity and specificity were found for differential glomerular filtration rate renography, differential effective renal plasma flow renography, and selective renal vein renin ratios, each performed after a single dose of captopril. Intravenous digital subtraction renal angiography detected all patients with renovascular hypertension and was normal in 71% of patients with essential hypertension. To evaluate potential screening tests for renovascular hypertension, we calculated predictive values applied to a low prevalence population. If the observed sensitivities and specificities apply to a population with 5% prevalence of renovascular hypertension, captopril-stimulated peripheral renin would have a positive predictive value of 12% and a negative predictive value of 98%. In 16 patients with known renal artery stenosis, neither the captopril-stimulated renal vein renin ratio nor captopril-stimulated differential renography accurately predicted blood pressure response to correction of the stenosis. We conclude that clinical criteria can identify a subgroup with 16.7% prevalence of renovascular hypertension. In this high prevalence group, intravenous digital subtraction renal angiography will identify virtually all patients with renovascular hypertension, and a normal study will be sufficient to exclude renovascular hypertension. In unselected hypertensive patients, screening with captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity may be the most useful and efficient procedure for identification of patients with renovascular hypertension. Functional tests do not accurately predict the hemodynamic significance of a renal artery stenosis.", 
    "130": "Plasma prorenin in humans is derived from both renal and extrarenal sources, but in the cat most plasma prorenin is normally of renal origin. Sodium depletion and beta-adrenergic blockade can increase plasma prorenin in cats, but the effects of sedatives and glucocorticoids are unknown. We examined the effect of ketamine, a centrally acting nonbarbiturate anesthetic, and of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone on plasma prorenin and renin. Intramuscular injection of ketamine (20 mg/kg, three times a day) for 4 days increased plasma prorenin slowly and consistently, from 7.4 +/- 1.4 (+/- SEM) to 11.4 +/- 2.2, 17.1 +/- 2.5, 20.2 +/- 3.0, and 29.2 +/- 3.4 ng/ml.h (P less than 0.001) on days 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, without any effect on plasma active renin. Plasma renin substrate and cortisol were also unchanged. Bilateral nephrectomy reduced both baseline and stimulated plasma prorenin to undetectable levels. Treatment with alpha 1-blocker, beta 1-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or Ca2+ antagonist did not affect the rise in prorenin induced by ketamine, but dexamethasone completely blocked the response. In contrast, dexamethasone alone had little effect on plasma prorenin. These results demonstrate that repetitive ketamine administration selectively increases plasma prorenin, suggesting that renal prorenin secretion may be regulated independently of active renin. Blockade of stimulated, but not baseline, plasma prorenin by dexamethasone is consistent with a negative effect of glucocorticoids on the regulatory elements of the renin gene.", 
    "131": "A novel inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) derived from tuna muscle, Pro-Thr-His-Ile-Lys-Trp-Gly-Asp (tuna AI), was chemically synthesized, and its biological properties were investigated. Synthetic tuna AI was found to be chemically and biologically indistinguishable from the native one. Tuna AI inhibited rabbit lung ACE non-competitively with Ki values of 1.7 and 5.7 microM with substrates, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine and angiotensin I, respectively. This peptide (5.3 microM) also doubled the effect of bradykinin in the contraction of isolated guinea pig ileum. The peptide did not show zinc chelating activity and carboxypeptidase A inhibitory activity. Thus, tuna AI was found to be a unique ACE inhibitory peptide with non-competitive manner, differing from many naturally occurring peptide ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "132": "A new series of gamma-D-Glu-containing N-benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) tripeptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was synthesized. The effect of varying the antepenultimate amino acid residue in this series on the biological activity was studied. Introduction of Lys and Orn residues at the P1 position provided the most potent inhibitors, 25a and 25b (IC50: 3.5 and 4.9 x 10(-9) M, respectively), which exhibited an oral antihypertensive activity. This result suggests that basic amino acid residues at the P1 position play an important role in binding with the S1 subsite of ACE in this series. Oral antihypertensive activity of selected compounds was evaluated.", 
    "133": "Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by persistent albuminuria, a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and elevated blood pressure. About 40% of all insulin-dependent diabetic patients will develop nephropathy, thus increasing their morbidity and mortality. The effect of early aggressive antihypertensive treatment with metoprolol, frusemide or thiazide in insulin-dependent diabetic patients with nephropathy has shown a significant reduction in albuminuria and in the rate of decline in the GFR (from 0.94 to 0.29 and 0.10 ml/min per month over 72 months of antihypertensive treatment). The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on kidney function in diabetic nephropathy showed that the GFR is not dependent on angiotensin II (Ang II), and that ACE inhibition diminished albuminuria, probably by lowering glomerular hypertension. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers combined with a diuretic protects kidney function and reduces albuminuria in diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can be considered as first-line drugs for hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "134": "The mapping of neuropeptidases in synaptosomal fractions prepared from dog ileum myenteric, deep muscular and submucous plexus was established by means of fluorigenic substrates and specific inhibitors. Endopeptidase 24.11, angiotensin-converting enzyme and aminopeptidases were found in all tissues, the highest amounts being recovered in the submucous preparation. Post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase was obtained in high quantities whatever the tissue source while proline endopeptidase was detected in low amounts and pyroglutamyl-peptide hydrolase was never detectable. The above peptidases were examined for their putative participation in the inactivation of neurotensin by monitoring the effect of specific inhibitors on the formation of the metabolites of labeled neurotensin separated by HPLC. Endopeptidases 24.11, 24.15 and 24.16 were respectively responsible for the formation of neurotensin(1-11), neurotensin(1-8) and neurotensin(1-10) that are devoid of biological activity. The secondary attacks occurring on neurotensin degradation products were the following: cleavage of neurotensin(1-10) into neurotensin(1-8) by angiotensin-converting enzyme; conversion of neurotensin(9-13) into neurotensin(11-13) by post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase; hydrolysis of neurotensin(11-13) into free tyrosine by aminopeptidase(s).", 
    "135": "A highly active angiotensin-producing enzyme (enzyme III) was obtained from the serum of bilaterally nephrectomized dogs by acid treatment and ammonium sulfate fractionation. An inactive precursor (proenzyme III) was converted to enzyme III during prolonged storage (or by treatment with acid or with cathepsin G or by incubation at 38 degrees C as described in the following paper). Enzyme III reacted maximally at pH 7.7 and it produced up to 400 ng of angiotensin II/mL serum/h (i.e., amounts 4000 times higher than that generated by the endogenous renin present in serum after bilateral nephrectomy). Enzyme III produced angiotensin II at identical rates when either dog angiotensinogen or angiotensin I was used as substrate, but the rate was 710 times higher with synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate. Enzyme III is not identical to renin, cathepsin G, tonin, enzyme I, enzyme II, the calcium-dependent angiotensin I-converting enzyme, or the calcium-independent carboxy peptidase, which acts by sequential cleavage of angiotensin I. Enzyme III was inhibited by alpha-1-antitrypsin, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and lima bean trypsin inhibitor (hence it is a serine proteinase). It was not inhibited by Captopril, Teprotide, or Enalapril. It had been reported previously that cathepsin G released from neutrophil granulocytes, by producing high local concentrations of angiotensin II, may provide a mobile means for modulating blood flow in tissue microvasculature during the inflammatory response. The present study offers a new, additional pathway, by enzyme III, for a similar rapid formation of angiotensin II from serum protein substrate or angiotensin I.", 
    "136": "The haemodynamic and hormonal effects of an elective change of antihypertensive therapy from a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug to a converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, were monitored in 12 hypertensive in-patients (WHO I). Blood pressure and heart rate were determined every 2-4 h using an automatic sphygmomanometer during an abrupt cessation of the previous beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug and commencement of treatment with enalapril 20 mg o.d. 12 h later. Mean blood pressure values at rest and during the hand grip test were lower when on enalapril, but heart rate was significantly higher, and three patients suffered from palpitations during the change. The change resulted in an improvement in cardiac function both at rest and during isometric work, as shown by echocardiography. A rapid decrease in plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and an increase in renin activity were also seen after the change, while plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) decreased towards normal values. The results suggest that an abrupt change from a chronic beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug to enalapril is safe, feasible and is likely to produce favourable haemodynamic and hormonal effects in hypertensive patients.", 
    "137": "Despite advances in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), the mortality rate continues to be high. A large number of the deaths are sudden, presumably due to ventricular arrhythmias. Complex ventricular arrhythmias are recorded in as many as 80% of patients with CHF, with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurring in 40%. The latter appears to be an independent predictor of mortality. Chronic structural abnormalities responsible for CHF may be the basis for the capability of a ventricle to support life-threatening arrhythmias, which are triggered by premature ventricular contractions. The pathogenesis of arrhythmias is multifactorial. Electrolyte abnormalities, ischemia, catecholamines, inotropic and antiarrhythmic drugs may worsen arrhythmias and increase susceptibility of a ventricle to sustained arrhythmias. Beta-adrenergic blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a beneficial effect. The role of various drugs in the pathogenesis and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias is discussed. The efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy targeted to asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, in order to prevent sudden death, is controversial. Pharmacotherapy guided by electrophysiologic testing is the treatment of choice for patients who have manifest sustained ventricular tachycardia, but patients resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation may require automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator.", 
    "138": "Congestive heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by circulatory and metabolic abnormalities. It has been apparent for more than 25 years that the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are markedly activated in the late stages of heart failure. These two systems interact to facilitate sympathetic drive and promote salt and water retention. Circumstantial evidence is now accumulating to indicate that excessive sympathetic drive and angiotensin II activity may contribute to the pathophysiology of heart failure. These observations suggest that a dual strategy of modulating sympathetic nervous system activity to the heart while blocking angiotensin II activity may provide a rational therapeutic approach to the treatment of heart failure. Xamoterol, a beta 1 partial agonist, may enhance myocardial contractile force in the steady state, while acting to inhibit excessive sympathetic drive during exercise or severe heart failure. The concomitant use of a converting-enzyme inhibitor would be expected to blunt the detrimental effects of excessive angiotensin II activity. Modulation of adrenergic drive coupled with inhibition of marked angiotensin II activity may be potentially more effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure than either strategy used alone.", 
    "139": "Surveys that evaluated antihypertensive drug-prescribing patterns were mailed to 150 family physicians and 150 primary care internists. The initial mailing was followed by a telephone follow-up and a second mailing. Forty-seven percent of family physicians and 41.9% of the internists who were still in practice returned the questionnaire. When asked about their choice of antihypertensive drug therapy for specific patients (based upon age, race, sex, and coexisting disease), the responses of the two specialties were similar. The only statistically significant difference was observed in the responses for a 58-year-old obese white woman with diabetes and renal impairment. In this example, the family physicians were more likely than internists to recommend an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or a beta-blocker (P = .036). This study demonstrates that the majority of physicians individualized initial therapy for hypertension to the specific patient rather than strictly following a stepped-care approach with diuretics or beta-blockers as initial therapy.", 
    "140": "Clinical and hemodynamic studies were carried out for the purpose of evaluating the effects of enalapril in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Enalapril 10-20 mg was given once to 10 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure (coronary 6, hypertensive heart disease 2 and idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy). Hemodynamic studies were done on the first day after drug administration and the same dose was maintained for 2 weeks. The results showed a decrease of mean BP of 18.29% (P less than 0.01), CVP 40.4% mPAP 23.9%, PCWP 41.2%, SVR 39.9% and PVR 41.3% respectively (P less than 0.001). Cardiac index increased 44.16% (P less than 0.001). The therapeutic action lasted more than 24 hours after a single dose. No further drop of BP was found weeks later, 6 patients in NYHA class III and 2 in class IV improved to class II. No severe side effects were found. The results showed that enalapril is well tolerated after a single dose and its therapeutic action lasts 2 weeks with improvement both in hemodynamics and subjective symptoms.", 
    "141": "Immunohistochemical studies and experiments with microdissected nephron segments indicate that the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) in the kidney is expressed in the vascular endothelial cells of the renal vessels and in the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule and the pars recta. Angiotensin converting enzyme is a membrane-bound zinc metallopeptidase and the primary structure has recently been determined by protein sequencing and molecular cloning. It is probably anchored to the cell membrane by a single, short, transmembrane domain located near the carboxy-terminal extremity. The larger, externally situated, amino-terminal part of the molecule is organized in two large, highly homologous domains, each with a putative active site. The function of the endothelial enzyme in the renal vessels is primarily related to angiotensin II (Ang II) formation. However, its level of expression in renal vessels, especially at the glomerular level, appears to be very low in the adult human kidney, and there is evidence that the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) may be a rate-limiting step in Ang II formation in the kidney. The vascular enzyme may also contribute to the inactivation of kinins in the peritubular circulation. In the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule, ACE is present in both the brush border and the basolateral membrane. Although the basolateral enzyme may be involved in Ang II formation in the peritubular interstitium, the function of the enzyme on the brush border is unknown. The effects of ACE inhibitors on renal function are primarily, if not exclusively, related to Ang II suppression and perhaps kinin potentiation in the renal circulation.", 
    "142": "Ten hypertensive, non-nephrotic patients with immunoglobulin (IgA) nephropathy treated with conventional therapy (vasodilators, beta-blockers, diuretics) were observed for 21.4 +/- 9 months. Treatment was then changed to an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor alone for an additional 22.6 +/- 9 months. The ACE inhibitor therapy was associated with a lower diastolic blood pressure and a slowing in the rate of decline in renal function, but no change in proteinuria.", 
    "143": "In 13 decerebrate cats we studied the effects of captopril (10 mg/kg, intravenous bolus) on the background cardiac preganglionic sympathetic discharge and on its responsiveness to brief baroreceptor deactivations induced by premature ventricular contractions. Captopril caused a significant reduction of 57 +/- 7% (from 2.4 +/- 0.4 impulses/0.1s) in sympathetic discharge, with a mean latency of 35 +/- 3 min from the time of drug administration. In addition, the increase in cardiac sympathetic firing during premature ventricular contractions was markedly reduced, from 257 +/- 30% to 70 +/- 17%, before and after administration of captopril. These data indicate that captopril is not only likely to inhibit sympathetic discharge to the heart, but is also likely to restrain the excitatory sympathetic responses to baroreceptor deactivation.", 
    "144": "Experiments were performed in anaesthetized cats, to determine whether renal nerves interfere with the negative feedback action of angiotensin II (Ang II) on renin release. The increase in renin release from the innervated kidney in response to captopril-induced inhibition of Ang II generation was compared with the response of the contralateral denervated kidney. Renin release was measured before (control), and 5, 15 and 30 min after the beginning of captopril infusion (1 mg/kg priming dose followed by 1 mg/kg per h for 30 min intravenously), and 60 min after the end of the infusion. During the captopril treatment renin release from both kidneys increased, but after 15 and 30 min the increase in renin release from the innervated kidneys was significantly larger than that observed in the denervated kidneys. After the captopril infusion was stopped, renin release from both kidneys returned towards control values. These results could not be explained on the basis of the changes in renal haemodynamics, excretory functions and efferent renal nerve activity observed during the captopril infusion. The data suggest that the renal nerves influence the changes in renin release caused by captopril by increasing the sensitivity of juxtaglomerular cells to the negative feedback action of Ang II.", 
    "145": "The following study was designed to examine the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril and enalapril on certain biological and physiological activities of isolated preparations of glomeruli from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive SHR rats. The results suggest that the contractile response of glomeruli from SHR to exogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) is significantly enhanced by captopril whereas it has a different effect on those from normotensive (WKY) rats. These effects are unrelated to changes in glomerular Ang II binding or the level of plasma renin activity (PRA), but they do depend partially on the sodium status of the animal. Whereas captopril induced a modest increase in the basal rate of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis by glomeruli from normotensive (WKY) but not by those from SHR, the reverse occurred in the presence of Ang II. Prostaglandin E2 synthesis was increased in both strains of rats in the presence of excess arachidonic acid. Further increases occurred with the addition of captopril, these increases being significantly greater by glomeruli from WKY rats than by those from SHR, while enalaprilat had no effect on PGE2 production. The glomerular synthesis of PGE2 was not influenced in either strain of rats by in vitro administration of captopril.", 
    "146": "1. Bradykinin (Bk; Arg1-Pro2-Pro3-Gly4-Phe5-Ser6-Pro7-Phe8-Arg8) inactivation by bulk isolated neurons from rat brain is described. 2. Bk is rapidly inactivated by neuronal perikarya (4.2 +/- 0.6 fmol/min/cell body). 3. Sites of inactivating cleavages, determined by a kininase bioassay combined with a time-course Bk-product analysis, were the Phe5-Ser6, Pro7-Phe8, Gly4-Phe5, and Pro3-Gly4 peptide bonds. The cleavage of the Phe5-Ser6 bond inactivated Bk at least five fold faster than the other observed cleavages. 4. Inactivating peptidases were identified by the effect of inhibitors on Bk-product formation. The Phe5-Ser6 bond cleavage is attributed mainly to a calcium-activated thiol-endopeptidase, a predominantly soluble enzyme which did not behave as a metalloenzyme upon dialysis and was strongly inhibited by N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-2-phenylethyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate and endo-oligopeptidase A antiserum. Thus, neuronal perikarya thiol-endopeptidase seems to differ from endo-oligopeptidase A and endopeptidase 24.15. 5. Endopeptidase 24.11 cleaves Bk at the Gly4-Phe5 and, to a larger extent, at the Pro7-Phe8 bond. The latter bond is also cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and prolyl endopeptidase (PE). PE also hydrolyzes Bk at the Pro3-Gly4 bond. 6. Secondary processing of Bk inactivation products occurs by (1) a rapid cleavage of Ser6-Pro7-Phe8-Arg8 at the Pro7-Phe8 bond by endopeptidase 24.11, 3820ACE, and PE; (2) a bestatin-sensitive breakdown of Phe8-Arg9; and (3) conversion of Arg1-Pro7 to Arg1-Phe5, of Gly4-Arg9 to both Gly4-Pro7 and Ser6-Arg9, and of Phe5-Arg9 to Ser6-Arg9, Phe8-Arg9, and Ser6-Pro7, by unidentified peptidases. 7. A model for the enzymatic inactivation of bradykinin by rat brain neuronal perikarya is proposed.", 
    "147": "The presence of an intrinsic inhibitor of ACE in blood of approximately 25% of sera submitted for serum ACE assay in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with sarcoidosis, and the common use of ACE inhibitors (captopril and enalapril) in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, stimulated these studies to compare the effects of the intrinsic and medicinal inhibitors upon serum ACE activity. Since the intrinsic ACE inhibitor in man is affected by serum dilution (inhibition is reversed) and by dialysis (inhibition becomes irreversible), these manipulations were also studied with medicinal inhibitors to provide guidelines for suspecting their presence in submitted serum samples without an accompanying history. Enalapril was found to have delayed onset of action after oral administration (1-2 hours), and was even further delayed (4 hours) when the intrinsic inhibitor also happened to be present. Inhibition by enalapril was not attenuated with refrigerated storage, with dilution or with dialysis of the serum. Captopril had a more rapid time of onset of ACE inhibition, but its inhibitory activity was markedly reduced with refrigerated storage of the serum; patients showed either a short half-life for the effect (1-4 days) or a prolonged half-life (10-17 days). Inhibitory activity of captopril was reversed following dilution of serum or following dialysis. The reversal of inhibition by captopril following dialysis, therefore, differed from the effect of dialysis on the intrinsic ACE inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "148": "Moexipril [2-[(1-ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]amino-1-oxopropyl]-6, 7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (S,S,S)], an ester prodrug of an ACE inhibitor, was formulated in controlled-release preparations with a range of in vitro release rates, to provide a prolonged input of drug in vivo. However, pharmacokinetic studies with the controlled-release dosage forms in humans produced plasma profiles with the same characteristics and time to peak as an immediate-release capsule. In vitro dissolution data from the controlled-release dosage form, as well as the known characteristics of the polymer used to control drug release from the dosage form, suggest no reason to suspect an abrupt halt to the in vivo release of the drug after 1-2 hr. The lack of sustained blood levels is, therefore, most likely due to failure of the GI tract to absorb the drug beyond some location in the upper small intestine, i.e., site-specific absorption. This theory is supported by a series of computer simulations involving moexipril and the active moiety, moexipril diacid. Possible mechanisms include poor drug permeability, a pH effect whereby the zwitterionic form of the drug is more rapidly absorbed, and esterase cleavage of moexipril to the poorly absorbed moexipril diacid.", 
    "149": "The results of more than 1600 patient years of experience with the new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril, suggest that it is safe for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. A once-daily regimen of quinapril minimizes adverse effects on renal function compared with a twice-daily regimen, and compared with enalapril. This may be because long-acting agents, or frequent doses of ACE inhibitors, produce a prolonged reduction in the glomerular filtration pressure.", 
    "150": "There is increasing evidence that inhibition of tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is important for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors. Radioligand inhibitor binding methods using 125I-351A and either tissue homogenates or in vitro autoradiography have allowed in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of tissue ACE inhibition by a variety of ACE inhibitors. The rank order of potency against plasma as well as lung, kidney, and cardiac homogenates was quinaprilat = benazeprilat greater than perindoprilat greater than lisinopril greater than enalaprilat greater than fosinoprilat. The highest concentration of ACE in the heart was found in the cardiac valves followed by the right and left atria, then the right and left ventricles. Ex vivo studies showed that after oral administration of quinapril, ACE was inhibited dose-dependently in the lung, kidney, aorta and heart for more than 24h. Tissue bioavailability of the inhibitor is also an important determinant of tissue ACE inhibition. Perindopril crossed the blood-brain barrier and inhibited brain ACE at high doses, but after equivalent doses of quinapril no brain ACE inhibition could be demonstrated. These results suggest that it may be possible to design ACE inhibitors to have specific effects on ACE in different tissues.", 
    "151": "Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors into clinical use, much information has been accumulated in animal models and man regarding their effects on renal function in different disease states. Enalapril, the first nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor approved for general use in the United States, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in controlling blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, renal parenchymal disease, renovascular hypertension, and diabetes with hypertension. Enalapril also appears capable of attenuating the progressive nature of renal disease in experimental models of chronic renal failure and diabetic nephropathy, perhaps through lowering intraglomerular pressures. The excellent blood pressure-lowering effects of ACE inhibitors, coupled with their potential to ameliorate renal hemodynamic abnormalities, make these compounds attractive for use in these clinical states.", 
    "152": "In this study eight healthy volunteers were involved in a randomized, cross-over trial in which they were treated with either 25 mg of captopril b.i.d. or 20 mg of enalapril o.i.d. alone or in combination with 50 mg of indomethacin b.i.d. in order to detect a difference between both converting enzyme inhibitors when interacting with indomethacin. Before and after each 4-d treatment period, blood pressure (determined by random zero sphygmomanometer), body weight, plasma renin activity, angiotensin converting enzyme, plasma potassium, serum creatinine and the 24-h urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were measured. Indomethacin attenuated the decrease of supine diastolic blood pressure during treatment with captopril, but not with enalapril. However, the initial decrease of blood pressure on captopril was greater than on enalapril. Both converting enzyme inhibitors had no effect on the urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, while indomethacin reduced it. The results suggest a difference between captopril and enalapril in interaction with indomethacin.", 
    "153": "Arterial plasma kinins and mean arterial pressure were measured in intact and bilaterally nephrectomized rats infused with vehicle or bradykinin to study the role of 1) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and other peptidases and 2) the kidney (a kininase-rich organ) in the metabolism of kinins in vivo. Before the infusion, rats were pretreated with vehicle, enalaprilat (an ACE inhibitor), or a cocktail of kininase inhibitors containing 1) enalaprilat, 2) DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethyl-thiopropanoic acid (MGTA), a carboxypeptidase N inhibitor, 3) phosphoramidon, a neutral endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, and 4) bestatin, an aminopeptidase B inhibitor. In the rats with vehicle (n = 8), the cocktail did not significantly increase endogenous kinins (from 31 +/- 6 to 41 +/- 9 pg/ml, p = 0.94). In the rats infused with bradykinin (peptidase substrate), plasma kinins increased threefold in the group pretreated with the vehicle, 21-fold in the enalaprilat group, and 22-fold in the cocktail group. These increases were doubled by nephrectomy but were not affected by ureteral ligation. In the groups pretreated with the cocktail or enalaprilat, the hypotensive effect of bradykinin was correlated with plasma kinin concentration (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001). After bradykinin infusion was stopped, plasma kinins decreased by half in 10-12 seconds in the rats pretreated with vehicle, enalaprilat, or cocktail. We concluded that ACE and the kidney are important to the metabolism of circulating kinins while carboxypeptidase N, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and aminopeptidase B are not. We also concluded that other tissue peptidases, not affected by either the above inhibitors or nephrectomy, play an important role in kinin metabolism.", 
    "154": "The interaction of the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system in patients with congestive heart failure is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can resensitize the beta-adrenergic receptor system. Guinea pigs were given captopril, isoproterenol, or both for 2 weeks. At death, cardiac sarcolemmal and light vesicle fractions and intact mononuclear leukocytes were prepared. Captopril treatment led to an up-regulation of cardiac beta 1- but not mononuclear leukocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptors and an increase in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the heart. Animals treated with isoproterenol developed cardiac hypertrophy, had increased plasma norepinephrine levels, and had a decreased number and responsiveness of both cardiac and mononuclear leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptors. Concomitant treatment with captopril attenuated alterations of heart weight, plasma norepinephrine levels, and cardiac beta-receptor density and function. In contrast to its cardiac effects, captopril treatment did not diminish the down-regulation of mononuclear leukocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptors by isoproterenol. Our data suggest that captopril may resensitize the cardiac but not the mononuclear leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system after long-term catecholamine exposure.", 
    "155": "Sodium restriction enhances the aldosterone response to angiotensin-II (AII) in normal rats, but not in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). To determine whether a change and/or abnormality in the circulating or adrenal renin-angiotensin systems are responsible for these observations, three groups of animals were studied on a low sodium diet with and without the administration of a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Kyoto (normotensive rat strains) and SHR were placed on low sodium (0.1%) for 9 days, the last 4 days of which enalapril was administered to half of the animals. In all groups enalapril treatment resulted in a significant (P less than 0.001) reduction in blood pressure, an increase in renin activity, and a reduction in plasma aldosterone when all of the animals were considered together, although the change in blood pressure achieved statistical significance only in the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Additionally, basal aldosterone output from isolated glomerulosa cells was lower in the normotensive animals pretreated with enalapril. However, despite the evidence for inhibition of converting enzyme, there was no change in the hypertensive animals. Thus, neither locally nor systemically generated AII appear to participate in the maintenance of the increased aldosterone responsiveness to AII with sodium restriction. Furthermore, they do not appear to contribute to the altered adrenal responsiveness to AII with sodium restriction in SHR. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that as yet undefined glomerulosa intracellular mechanisms are altered by dietary sodium restriction in normotensive, but not hypertensive, rats.", 
    "156": "To establish an optimal approach for the patients with bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, combined treatment involving percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and oral captopril was applied. Five patients were examined for effects of the combined treatment on blood pressure and renal function. After percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty on one renal artery, the blood pressure (mean +/- SD) fell from 210/118 +/- 26/8 to 176/104 +/- 11/9 mm Hg without any deterioration of renal function. This reduced blood pressure was further lowered to 155/92 +/- 6/3 mm Hg by adding captopril therapy. This level of blood pressure has been maintained for an average of 37 months. Significant increases in serum creatinine concentration were not observed (124 +/- 27 vs 141 +/- 44 mumol/L), and renal size has been sustained. These results indicate that combined treatment with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and captopril is effective in reducing the blood pressure and preserving renal function as an approach for the patients with bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.", 
    "157": "The effects of enoximone, a new cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase inhibitor, were compared with those of captopril in a double-blind study in a group of 10 patients with severe heart failure. Four weeks treatment with enoximone improved symptom-limited exercise tolerance from a mean value of 11.33 to 13.36 minutes (P less than 0.05) and 4 weeks of captopril treatment from 11.01 to 13.92 minutes (P less than 0.05). Four of the patients had a greater exercise tolerance taking enoximone, the remaining 6 while taking captopril. Both drugs reduced perceived exertion during submaximal exercise. Minute ventilation measured at rest and during submaximal exercise was also reduced by both drugs. Resting and post exercise calf blood flow was increased to a similar extent with captopril (P less than 0.03) and enoximone (P less than 0.005). There was no difference in calf blood flow and calf vascular resistance between the drugs suggesting that the peripheral haemodynamic effects of enoximone are due to peripheral vasodilatation. Enoximone is a useful drug for the treatment of patients with severe heart failure.", 
    "158": "Recent observations implicate angiotensin-II (AII) as a possible PRL-releasing factor. These observations prompted us to investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in PRL release in man. Nine normal volunteers ingesting a 20-40 mmol/day sodium, 70 mmol/day potassium diet and eight normal volunteers ingesting a 120 mmol/day sodium, 70 mmol/day potassium diet were infused with metoclopramide (2.5 mg over 1 min) and later with TRH (500 micrograms), two agents known to cause PRL release. The infusions were repeated after 36 h of oral administration of converting enzyme inhibitor [CEI; captopril (50 mg, orally, four times daily) or enalapril (5 mg, orally, twice daily)]. On a separate occasion, AII was infused at 10 ng/kg.h for 1 h into normal volunteers on normal salt diet. CEI administration lowered mean arterial pressure by 6-7 mm Hg and stimulated the release of active renin. The PRL responses on low and normal salt diet as well as before and after CEI were not statistically different. There was also no difference in the PRL responses of patients placed on captopril vs. those on enalapril. AII increased blood pressure by 11-25 mm Hg, but did not increase PRL significantly above basal concentrations during the control dextrose infusion. Five hyperprolactinemic volunteers were also given CEI for up to 4 weeks. They demonstrated no significant change in serum PRL levels. We conclude that AII in the pituitary does not significantly alter either basal PRL levels or metoclopramide- and TRH-induced PRL responses in normal subjects on low and high salt diets. In addition, CEI is not a useful therapy in patients with pathological hyperprolactinemia. These findings, however, do not exclude a role for AII in physiological regulation, since CEI does not cross the blood-brain barrier and would not be expected to alter hypothalamic AII.", 
    "159": "To evaluate the role of endopeptidase 24.11 in metabolism of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in vivo, we examined the effect of thiorphan, an inhibitor of this enzyme, on plasma ANP concentrations and the cardiovascular and renal actions of ANP(99-126). Thiorphan alone produced a modest increase in urinary sodium excretion in anesthetized rats; however, urine flow, arterial pressure, and basal plasma ANP concentrations were unchanged. When administered during an infusion of ANP(99-126) (330 ng/kg/min i.v.), thiorphan increased the plasma concentration of ANP and enhanced the diuretic and natriuretic activity of this hormone. The effects on urine flow and urinary sodium excretion were most pronounced immediately after the inhibitor was administered and later diminished in magnitude. Thiorphan did not alter the depressor activity of exogenous ANP(99-126). These data suggest that endopeptidase 24.11 participates in metabolism of ANP(99-126) and that thiorphan potentiates the renal actions of this hormone by inhibiting its degradation.", 
    "160": "The glomerular size-selective properties in a patient with \"hyponatremic hypertensive syndrome\" were investigated before and after administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Hyponatremic hypertensive syndrome is a rare condition of renovascular hypertension characterized by electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypokalemia), polyuria, and high renin activity. In this patient a marked increase in urinary protein excretion was observed. Treatment with enalapril normalized BP, corrected electrolyte abnormalities, and reduced proteinuria. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the clearance of neutral dextrans of graded sizes were measured before and after 6 months of enalapril (20 mg/d) administration. Theoretical analysis of dextran and inulin clearance data with a model of glomerular size selectivity were adopted to separate effects of hemodynamic changes on macromolecule filtration from changes of intrinsic membrane selective properties. After enalapril urinary protein excretion decreased, GFR was unchanged and RPF almost doubled. Fractional clearance values of dextran molecules were markedly elevated in comparison with the corresponding values measured in a group of normal controls and were normalized by enalapril. Theoretical calculation of membrane pore characteristics showed that enalapril treatment reduced the radius of all membrane pores by approximately 1 nm. Altogether these results indicate that enalapril normalized glomerular filtration of neutral macromolecules and circulating proteins in a human condition of angiotensin II-induced proteinuria. Enalapril effectively restored glomerular size-selective function, reducing dimensions of membrane pores, independently of its effect on renal hemodynamics.",

This study sought to identify oral hemodynamic effects of these agents which could underlie such efficacy in this heart failure model. Four weeks after ligation of the left main coronary artery, basal left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure and dP/dtmax, heart rate and mean blood pressure of the MI rats were significantly less than that of sham-operated controls, and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was markedly elevated. Milrinone, at 2.0 mg/kg, reduced LVEDP and renal blood flow of these 4-week MI rats by an average of 39 and 18%, respectively (P less than 0.05) within 1 h. At 4.0 mg/kg, it reduced LVEDP by 46% and raised heart rate by 16% (P less than 0.05). Enalapril (1.0 mg/kg) increased small intestine blood flow of these compromised rats by 16% (P less than 0.05), and tended to reduce LVEDP (-28%) within 1.5 h. Treatment with milrinone (2.0 mg/kg) plus enalapril (1.0 mg/kg) promoted LV dP/dtmax, coronary blood flow, and heart rate by 48, 40 and 13%, and reduced LVEDP by 40% (P less than 0.05 for all effects). Thus these agents can reduce LVEDP and redistribute cardiac output of MI rats. Furthermore, the combination of enalapril and milrinone can restore LVEDP and LV dP/dtmax of MI rats to near normal and promote coronary blood flow without compromising cardiac output or renal blood flow. Such effects, it timely or sustained, may prolong survival.",

Recently, activation of coagulation under ACE inhibition with captopril has been described. In an open, randomized study, we compared the influence of enalapril on various coagulation parameters with that of hydrochlorothiazide. In contrast to the latter, we detected no unfavorable influence of enalapril on the coagulation factors investigated.

    "171": "Doxazosin is the latest in a series of highly selective postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitors. It is readily absorbed, with high bioavailability and a relatively long plasma half-life, neither of which property is influenced by age. This accounts for the prolonged pharmacologic activity of doxazosin following a single oral dose. Its prime pharmacodynamic activity resides in its ability to counter sympathetic vasoconstriction of the systemic arteriolar resistance vessels and venous capacitance system, which enables the drug to target the major pathophysiologic abnormality in hypertension, i.e., the generalized systemic arteriolar constriction. The widespread vasodilation induced by doxazosin relieves both cardiac preload and afterload and, consequently, reduces left ventricular wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption. In hypertension, doxazosin reduces blood pressure both at rest and during exercise by reduction of systemic vascular resistance without precipitating substantial reflex cardiac stimulation. The effects are maximal on the standing blood pressure between two and four hours after ingestion; due to doxazosin's relatively slow absorption, postural hypotension is infrequent. Its antihypertensive activity is maintained over 24 hours following a single oral dose, and the optimal dose range is 2 to 8 mg once daily. The antihypertensive efficacy of doxazosin has been shown to be comparable with that of other alpha-adrenoceptor inhibitors, beta-blocking drugs, diuretics, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In contrast to other conventional antihypertensive drugs, a unique feature of alpha-adrenoceptor-inhibiting drugs, including doxazosin, is their ability to reduce the plasma concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. This contrasts with the opposite effect on lipid levels induced by hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol seen in comparative studies. Side effects show no predilection for any organ system, and the overall incidence of such effects compares well with those of other commonly used antihypertensive drugs. This unique combination of antihypertensive efficacy and favorable effect on blood lipid levels indicates that once-daily treatment with doxazosin holds considerable promise in the treatment of hypertension, both from the point of view of its antihypertensive efficacy and also from its primary preventative potential.", 
    "172": "Urapidil has been approved as sustained-release capsules containing 30, 60 and 90 mg, respectively, and as ampules containing 25 and 50 mg for treatment of all grades of hypertension, in several countries in Europe, South America, as well as in Japan and other Asian regions. In general, the treatment should start with 60 mg twice daily, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 in the evening. This schedule may be adapted according to the therapeutic needs. During the last few years, urapidil has been investigated extensively in comparison with several types of established antihypertensive drugs. Urapidil given orally has been tested in comparative trials against placebo, acebutolol, metoprolol, captopril, nifedipine and nitrendipine with responder rates of 40 to 70%. These responder rates are to be expected for a variety of antihypertensive drugs in monotherapy. Further studies with clonidine, prazosin and alpha-methyldopa showed similar responder rates as established for the other antihypertensive drugs studied. Adverse reactions include dizziness, headache and nausea and occasionally tiredness, orthostatic dysregulation and gastric disorders. These symptoms were transient, mostly occurring during the early phases of therapy and disappearing as treatment continued. Adverse effects are considered to be mainly due to blood pressure reduction. Intravenous comparative trials have been performed with urapidil against placebo, diazoxide and sodium nitroprusside. Adverse effects of parenterally applied urapidil are similar to those observed during oral treatment. Specific contraindications for urapidil are unknown.

After a 2-week washout and placebo phase, 295 essential hypertensive patients (World Health Organization grades I and II) were treated for 12 weeks with either urapidil or captopril, initially with urapidil, 60 mg twice daily or captopril, 25 mg twice daily, with the possibility of adjusting the dose according to blood pressure response after 2 weeks of treatment. Blood pressure values at the end of the 12-week treatment decreased significantly in the group receiving urapidil (n = 142, all dosages), from 175/103 to 154/89 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and in the group receiving captopril (n = 153, all dosages) from 175/103 to 154/90 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); these values corresponded to 62% urapidil and 58% captopril responder rates (diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg), respectively. The computer-assisted frequency distribution of the patients with controlled diastolic blood pressure (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) over the duration of the study demonstrated comparable efficacy for both drugs. Adverse effects were observed in 45 patients in the urapidil group and in 18 patients in the captopril group (vertigo, nausea, headache). The results revealed that the 2 antihypertensive agents with different modes of action controlled blood pressure with equal efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "174": "ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme; peptidyl dipeptidase A; EC 3.4.15.1), cleaves C-terminal dipeptides from active peptides containing a free C-terminus. We investigated the hydrolysis of cholecystokinin-8 [CCK-8; Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2] and of various gastrin analogues by purified rabbit lung ACE. Although these peptides are amidated at their C-terminal end, they were metabolized by ACE to several peptide fragments. These fragments were analysed by h.p.l.c., isolated and identified by comparison with synthetic fragments, and by amino acid analysis. The initial and major site of hydrolysis was the penultimate peptide bond, which generated a major product, the C-terminal amidated dipeptide Asp-Phe-NH2. As a secondary cleavage, ACE subsequently released di- or tri-peptides from the C-terminal end of the remaining N-terminal fragments. The cleavage of CCK-8 and gastrin analogues was inhibited by ACE inhibitors (Captopril and EDTA), but not by other enzyme inhibitors (phosphoramidon, thiorphan, bestatin etc.). Hydrolysis of [Leu15]gastrin-(14-17)-peptide [Boc (t-butoxycarbonyl)-Trp-Leu-Asp-Phe-NH2] in the presence of ACE was found to be dependent on the chloride-ion concentration. Km values for the hydrolysis of CCK-8, [Leu15]gastrin-(11-17)-peptide and Boc-[Leu15]gastrin-(14-17)-peptide at an NaCl concentration of 300 mM were respectively 115, 420 and 3280 microM, and the catalytic constants were about 33, 115 and 885 min-1. The kcat/Km for the reactions at 37 degrees C was approx. 0.28 microM-1.min-1, which is approx. 35 times less than that reported for the cleavage of angiotensin I. These results suggest that ACE might be involved in the metabolism in vivo of CCK and gastrin short fragments.", 
    "175": "Capsaicin-evoked release of substance P-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) from dorsal horn slices of guinea pig spinal cord was unaffected by incubation with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10 microM). However, incubation with the endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, thiorphan (10 microM), induced a 2.44-fold increase of capsaicin-evoked SP-LI release, leaving the capsaicin-evoked release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-LI unchanged. Endopeptidase-24.11 activity was higher in homogenates of the dorsal than ventral spinal cord. Endopeptidase-24.11 might be involved in the inactivation of SP released from central endings of primary sensory neurons.", 
    "176": "We studied the effect of bradykinin on ciliary activity and its modulation by peptidases in cultured rabbit tracheal epithelium in vitro. Bradykinin (10(-7) M) elicited a rapid, transient increase in ciliary beat frequency (CBF) from the baseline values of 1,031 +/- 25 to 1,388 +/- 38 beats/min (mean +/- SE, p less than 0.001), followed by a decline to a steady-state value of 1,180 +/- 30 beats/min, which was still greater than the baseline CBF. This ciliostimulation was dose-dependently inhibited by the B2-receptor antagonist (D-Arg,Hyp3,Thi5.8,D-Phe7)-bradykinin but not by the B1-receptor antagonist (Des-Arg9,Leu8)-bradykinin. Nifedipine, Ca2+-free medium, indomethacin, the phospholipase A2 inhibitor mepacrine, and the methyltransferase inhibitor 3-deazaadenosine reduced the change in CBF. Involvement of tachykinins, leukotrienes, prostaglandin D2, or thromboxane A2 was ruled out because bradykinin's action was not affected by (D-Pro2,D-Trp7.9)-substance P, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, or SQ29548, an antagonist for prostaglandin D2 and thromboxane A2. Bradykinin also increased prostaglandin E2 release (p less than 0.01), an effect that was abolished by indomethacin and Ca2+ deficiency. The CBF dose-response curve for bradykinin was shifted to lower concentrations by 1 log U by the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon (p less than 0.01), whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was without effect. These results suggest that bradykinin interacts with B2-type receptors and stimulates ciliary activity through Ca2+-dependent prostaglandin E2 release, and that neutral endopeptidase may play a role in modulating the effect of bradykinin on airway mucociliary transport.", 
    "177": "Although earlier debates had questioned the wisdom of treating hypertension in elderly patients, it is now becoming apparent that such treatment is warranted. Systolic hypertension, which prevails in this population, is more closely correlated to hypertensive complications than is diastolic blood pressure. Recent multicenter trials have demonstrated that in this age group, as in younger patients, control of hypertension can significantly decrease the rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Many effective antihypertensive agents are available today, but elderly patients, because of their hemodynamic and biochemical characteristics, are particularly vulnerable to the common side effects of most drugs. However, the two newer classes of drugs (the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the calcium channel blockers) offer several advantages in terms of favorable hemodynamic and biochemical profiles, convenience of dosing, and maintenance of quality of life. These characteristics justify choosing these agents as first-line therapy for hypertension.", 
    "178": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of inhibition of endogenous opioid degradation on digitalis-induced arrhythmias, utilizing the inhibitors bacitracin, bestatin, captopril, and D-phenylalanine. Guinea pigs, anesthetized with pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg i.p., and breathing spontaneously received intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of bacitracin (6.8 mg/kg), bestatin (1 mg/kg), captopril (2 mg/kg), D-phenylalanine (1.2 mg/kg) or the diluent, saline. Digitalis arrhythmias were induced by a 50 micrograms/kg i.v. bolus of digoxin followed by 500 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 i.v. Bacitracin and bestatin, but not captopril or D-phenylalanine, significantly (p less than 0.05) altered the relationship between the digoxin dose and the first occurrence of arrhythmias, i.e., digoxin-induced ventricular arrhythmias became manifest at lower digoxin doses. The mean digoxin dose and ED50s, at which arrhythmias first occurred, were significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced by bacitracin and bestatin. The findings were similar for fatal arrhythmias, although D-phenylalanine appeared to decrease the digoxin dose at the development of fatal arrhythmias. The opioid antagonist naloxone, in a 50 micrograms/kg bolus and 50 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 i.c.v., completely prevented these effects of bacitracin and reduced the effect of bestatin. The relationship to arrhythmias could not be ascribed to an effect on blood pressure, as the blood pressure response to digoxin was the same in bestatin, D-phenylalanine, and control groups. To examine whether systemic administration of an inhibitor of opioid degradation had similar effects, a second protocol was selected with systemic administration of bacitracin because it altered the dose effect relationship after i.c.v. administration and systemic concentrations could be readily attained. Bacitracin, in a 13.5 mg/kg i.v. bolus and 135 mg.kg-1.h-1 i.v., was followed by 100 micrograms/kg digoxin i.v. every 15 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "179": "The acute haemodynamic effect of perindoprilat was examined at rest, supine and sitting, and during 100 W bicycle exercise in 12 patients (mean age 42 years) with essential hypertension. Intra-arterial blood pressure and the heart rate were recorded continuously. Cardiac output was measured by dye dilution (Cardiogreen) and blood volume was determined by radio-iodinated (125I) human serum albumin. Two hours after a slow (3 min) intravenous injection of perindoprilat, blood pressure was reduced in all patients (P less than 0.01)--at rest sitting from 175/108 to 153/97 mmHg (11%)--because of reduction in total peripheral resistance index (f = 2.63; P less than 0.05). Only minor changes were seen in the heart rate, stroke index and cardiac output. The fall in blood pressure was significantly (P less than 0.05) correlated with blood volume (r = 0.65) and pretreatment total peripheral resistance index (r = 0.59).", 
    "180": "The renin inhibitor CGP 29,287 was administered continuously for 7 days (30 mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally, via osmotic minipumps) to normotensive marmosets fed a low-salt diet. As a control, another group of marmosets was given vehicle only. After 7 days of treatment, the mean arterial blood pressure of the CGP 29,287-treated marmosets was significantly lowered by about 23 mmHg. Plasma immunoreactive total and active renin were increased 10- and sevenfold, respectively, whereas plasma renin activity (PRA) was reduced by 95%. Plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone were also reduced (by 97 and 85%, respectively). Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity was unchanged and there were no differences in plasma concentrations of electrolytes, urea or creatinine between CGP 29,287-treated and control marmosets. These results indicate that although renin release is markedly stimulated after continuous administration of a renin inhibitor for 7 days, the formation of Ang II and aldosterone, the active hormones of the renin-angiotensin system, is substantially reduced.", 
    "181": "Heart failure remains a major therapeutic problem with a poor prognosis despite therapy with digitalis, diuretics and vasodilator drugs. Because impaired myocardial contractility is a principal feature of persistent heart failure, the development of phosphodiesterase inhibitors, e.g. milrinone, has presented important therapeutic possibilities. Milrinone exerts both positive inotropic and vasodilator activity, and improves systemic haemodynamics by increasing left ventricular stroke volume and decreasing left ventricular filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance. In addition to improving systolic pump function, milrinone has also been shown to improve impaired diastolic relaxation of the failing heart. Importantly, treatment with milrinone does not significantly increase myocardial oxygen consumption. In moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III and IV), intravenous and oral milrinone have been shown not only to produce acute haemodynamic improvement but also to relieve the associated symptom of breathlessness, with improvement in quality-of-life indices. In placebo-controlled, double-blind studies oral milrinone has enhanced exercise tolerance and increased total body oxygen consumption in mild (class II), moderate and severe heart failure. There is no evidence of a substantial pro-arrhythmic effect or other significant non-cardiovascular side-effects associated with the use of milrinone. The possibility of improved survival, which is still the ultimate goal of therapy with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, remains to the studied. Similarly, the role of these agents in the management of mild heart failure, alone or in addition to therapy with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, warrants further evaluation.", 
    "182": "To examine the influence of dietary sodium, prostaglandin, and captopril on vascular reactivity, 12 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and seven normotensive subjects (NT) were given a high sodium diet and thereafter a low sodium diet, each for ten days. Indomethacin (IND) (150 mg/d) was administered during the last three days of each dietary period. Blood pressure and cardiac output (CO) (by impedance cardiography) were measured during the angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion before and after the IND treatment of each dietary period. In eight patients with EH, captopril 100 mg was given before Ang II infusion. EH patients were classified as either salt sensitive (SS) or nonsalt sensitive (NSS). The mean blood pressure (MBP) response to Ang II was significantly higher on high sodium intake than on low sodium intake in NSS and NT, but not in SS. IND significantly increased the MBP response to Ang II on low sodium intake in NSS and NT, but not in SS. IND significantly increased the TPR response to Ang II on low sodium intake, remarkably in NSS and NT compared with SS. Salt sensitivity (% decrease in MBP from high to low sodium intake) highly correlated with the increase in the TPR response to Ang II by IND on low sodium intake (r = -0.90). After captopril administration, IND still increased the MBP and TPR response to Ang II on low sodium intake. These results suggest that the modulation of the vascular responsiveness to Ang II by prostaglandins is altered by sodium balance and salt sensitivity in EH.", 
    "183": "Proper classification of patients into diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous subsets and the anticipation of complications are the keys to the management of individuals with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Patients with early diffuse disease and rapidly progressive skin thickening are at highest risk to develop serious internal organ involvement (intestine, lung, heart, kidney) and should be considered for disease modifying therapy. The targets of the disease and sites of possible intervention are vascular endothelium (vasoprotection agents), mononuclear cell subsets (immunosuppressive agents), and fibroblasts (colchicine, D-penicillamine). A number of new therapeutic agents with sound scientific rationale are undergoing therapy trials. Much can be done to improve the lifestyle of the scleroderma sufferer. The most dramatic recent development is the ability to reverse kidney involvement with prompt use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and modern methods of renal dialysis and transplantation. Scleroderma is not a hopeless disease.", 
    "184": "Ascites in patients with cirrhosis of the liver frequently is refractory to diuretic treatment. It was postulated that vasoconstriction of the renal cortex, mediated by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS), may be one course of the disturbed sodium- and water-excretion in these patients. We therefore investigated in 14 cirrhotic patients with ascites under constant diuretic treatment the effects of low-dose captopril therapy on urinary sodium- and potassium-excretion, body weight, abdominal girth, serum-sodium, -potassium, creatinine-clearance, plasma-renin-activity (PRA), plasma-aldosterone (PA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). After a control period of 4 days the patients received 2 x 6.25 mg/d captopril for 5 days and 4 x 6.25 mg/d for further 5 days. Treatment was followed by a second control period without captopril. PRA increased significantly after 2 days of captopril treatment. 2 x 6.25 mg/d captopril induced a significant increase in sodium excretion and a significant decrease of body weight. MAP decreased slightly but significantly without clinical signs of hypotension. 4 x 6.25 mg/d captopril resulted in a further reduction of body weight and a further enhancement of sodium excretion. Three days after withdrawal of captopril sodium output was significantly reduced again.",

    "186": "These experiments were conducted to test whether drinking to ip captopril or to intraventricular carbachol requires an intact fiber system from the ventral subfornical organ (SFO). Wire-knife cuts were made through the wall of the third ventricle ventral to the SFO. Control rats had either sham lesions or histologically identified missed cuts. Rats with good cuts (a) drank less than either control group after ip injections of 4 mg/kg captopril, (b) drank normal amounts of 0.3 M NaCl solution when captopril was placed in the drinking water at 0.1 mg/ml, (c) drank less water but a normal amount of saline after 6 mg/kg captopril ip and 10 mg/kg furosemide diuretic ip, and (d) drank normal amounts of water after lateral ventricular injections of 1.2 or 4 nmol of carbachol. The results of the captopril experiments confirm predictions based on studies of SFO lesions and suggest that captopril causes water, but not saline, drinking via an angiotensin-related mechanism acting at the SFO. The carbachol experiment indicates either that the SFO is not a unique receptor site for ventricular carbachol or that the fibers mediating this response do not require the pathways through the ventral pole of the SFO.", 
    "187": "Three-hour infusions of angiotensin II (ANG II) agonists and antagonists were used to determine the relative sites of action of ANG in producing water drinking and salt appetite. In the first experiment, lateral ventricular (LV) but not fourth ventricular (4V) ANG II elicited water and saline intake, and LV but not 4V sarile, a competitive ANG II receptor blocker, reduced saline intake aroused by ip injections of 10 mg/kg furosemide and 6 mg/kg captopril. In the second experiment, water, but not saline, intake to furosemide-captopril treatment was reduced by sarile infusions into the subfornical organ (SFO). It is concluded that (a) brain ANG receptors for water and saline intakes are more accessible from the forebrain than the hindbrain ventricles and (b) receptors for water drinking, but not saline intake, after captopril reside in part in the SFO. Salt appetite appears to be dependent on ANG II receptors somewhere in the forebrain other than in the SFO.", 
    "188": "The validity of using EXP6803, a nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, and KAA8, an AII monoclonal antibody, as specific tools for studying the physiology of AII has been established previously. In this study, we used these specific probes to examine the role of blocking AII formation in the antihypertensive effect of captopril in conscious renal artery-ligated rats (RALRs), a high renin, renal hypertensive model. Mean arterial pressure and plasma renin activity in a typical group of RALRs averaged 175 +/- 5 mm Hg and 28.2 +/- 6.2 ng of angiotensin 1 per ml/hr (n = 6), respectively. The antihypertensive effect of captopril (3 mg/kg i.v.) was determined in RALRs given either EXP6803 (30 mg/kg + 2 mg/kg/min i.v.) or KAA8 (10 mg + 1 mg/min i.v. per rat) with the corresponding vehicle-treated RALRs. These doses of EXP6803 and KAA8 were very effective in blocking the pressor response to AII but not to norepinephrine or vasopressin in RALRs. Captopril decreased mean arterial pressure by 44 +/- 2 and 53 +/- 8 mm Hg in the groups treated with the vehicles of EXP6803 (n = 5) and KAA8 (n = 5), respectively. In the presence of EXP6803 (n = 5) or KAA8 (n = 5), the antihypertensive effect of captopril was almost or totally abolished. Indomethacin did not alter the antihypertensive effect of captopril. These results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of captopril in conscious RALRs is due mainly to the blockade of AII formation. Furthermore, circulating AII rather than locally formed AII appears to play a major role in maintaining hypertension in hypertension in RALRs.", 
    "189": "The effects of a new angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril via sublingual was studied in 16 patients (median age 60.5 +/- 8.7 years). 10 were female and 6 male with hypertension crisis defined as systolic pressure (SP) greater than or equal to 220 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure greater than or equal to 120 mmHg (DP). We observed a significant decrease of SP and DP 20 min after the enalapril administration, without affecting the cardiac rate (p less than 0.001). This decrease was maintained during 30 and 60 min (p less than 0.001). Secondary effects were not observed. We concluded that sublingual enalapril can be a useful drug in hypertension crisis when not an urgent life compromising situation in elderly patients, because of its gradual hypotensive and maintained effect, allowing the commencement of an oral treatment.", 
    "190": "Comparative effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril on progression of chronic renal disease was studied in 3/4 nephrectomized rats. Rats were divided into sham and nephrectomized groups, and treated with plain water or water containing captopril (150 mg/liter) or enalapril (50 mg/liter). Evaluations were made 4 weeks before and 0, 4, 8, and 10 weeks after nephrectomy. Endogenous creatinine clearance decreased in drug-treated, nephrectomized rats to values less than sham controls, but remained greater than water-treated rats. Significant (P less than 0.05) proteinuria developed 4 weeks post-nephrectomy in water-treated rats, 8 weeks post-nephrectomy in captopril-treated rats, but did not develop in enalapril treated rats. Regression analysis of carbamylated plasma protein values vs plasma creatinine revealed significant (P less than 0.05) relationships only in the water-treated, nephrectomized rats from weeks 0 through 8, but were otherwise unaffected by treatment. Both drugs resulted in significantly (P less than 0.05) improved scores for renal histologic lesions as compared to water treatment. Modifications of proteinuria in captopril and enalapril-treated rats occurred prior to onset of changes in systolic blood pressure, which was significantly elevated only in water-treated, nephrectomized rats at weeks 8 and 10. We conclude that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may ameliorate progression of experimental renal disease through intrarenal effects, independent of modulation of systemic blood pressure, and that enalapril may be superior to captopril in some regards.", 
    "191": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-I) by enalapril on splanchnic (n = 10) and central hemodynamics (n = 9) were examined in moderately salt-depleted healthy volunteers, at rest and during 15-20 min of lower body negative pressure (LBNP), reducing mean arterial pressure by 10 mmHg. During LBNP before ACE-I, both splanchnic and total peripheral vascular resistances increased. During ACE-I, splanchnic and total peripheral vascular resistances decreased. After enalapril administration, splanchnic vascular resistance did not increase during LBNP. Total peripheral vascular resistance still increased but not to the same extent as during LBNP before ACE-I. The increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine during LBNP were attenuated after ACE-I compared with LBNP before ACE-I. The effectiveness of the ACE-I was clearly demonstrated by unchanged and low plasma angiotensin II levels during ACE-I. We conclude that, in normal sodium-depleted humans, acute ACE-I decreases splanchnic vascular resistance at rest and abolishes splanchnic vasoconstriction during LBNP. Furthermore, it may interfere with autonomic nervous system control of the circulation.", 
    "192": "We studied the efficacy of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in treating overt proteinuria in comparison with the NSAID indomethacin, and evaluated some of the conditions that could influence this antiproteinuric effect. In 12 patients with a proteinuria varying from 3.2 to 10.5 g/24 hr, a diastolic BP ranging from 64 to 105 mm Hg, and a GFR varying from 34 to 127 ml/min, the effect of different lisinopril doses and of changing dietary sodium intake was evaluated. Proteinuria fell by 27 +/- 20% from 6.1 +/- 2.1 to 4.5 +/- 1.9 g/24 hr on a low dose (median 5 mg/day) lisinopril and by 50 +/- 17% to 3.1 +/- 1.4 g/24 hr on a higher dose (median 10 mg/day), irrespective of initial proteinuria, BP, or GFR. This antiproteinuric effect was abolished by increasing salt intake from 50 to 200 mmol/day, and was recovered again by re-instituting the sodium restricted diet. The antiproteinuric effect of 10 mg/day lisinopril was comparable to the reduction in proteinuria (by 57 +/- 21% to 2.8 +/- 2.0 g/24 hr) on 150 mg/day indomethacin, while adverse effects were less and renal hemodynamic effects were more favorable during lisinopril. In some patients it took several weeks before the effect of the ACE inhibitor on proteinuria was stabilized. Thus, the antiproteinuric effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril appears to be dose and time related, and is strongly dependent on dietary sodium restriction, whereas it does not depend on initial proteinuria, BP, or GFR. The effect is comparable to that of indomethacin, while adverse effects are less.", 
    "193": "Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) synthesized in the anterior (AL) and intermediate lobe (IL) of the rat pituitary gland, is a prohormone precursor of several peptide hormones that may participate in the regulation of blood pressure. We therefore studied the biosynthesis of POMC by measuring the incorporation of 3H-tyrosine into the IL of 32-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) of the Aoki-Okamoto strain and their normotensive controls, the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). Under basal conditions, POMC biosynthesis was significantly reduced in the SHR (1130 +/- 102 cpm/30 min/IL, n = 13) when compared to the WKY (1515 +/- 163 cpm/30 min/IL, N = 12, P less than 0.05, t test). There was also an inverse correlation between systolic blood pressure and POMC biosynthesis in both the WKY (Y = 8.4 +/- 1.38X + 2097 +/- 673, r = 0.86 +/- 0.06, N = 5), and SHR (Y = 5.7 +/- 1.8X + 1122 +/- 336 r = 0.57 +/- 0.13, N = 3). The decreased POMC biosynthesis was associated with a higher dopamine content in IL in SHR compared to WKY (1.56 +/- 0.53, n = 17 v 0.51 +/- 0.16, n = 17 pmol/IL, P less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Oral administration of three different antihypertensive agents (propranolol, captopril, or hydralazine) for 12 weeks normalized blood pressure and POMC biosynthesis in the SHR but had no effect on either variable in the WKY. Because POMC biosynthesis in IL increased with normalization of blood pressure in the SHR, the decreased POMC biosynthesis in SHR may be a consequence rather than a cause of the elevated blood pressure in SHR.", 
    "194": "We studied the effects of lisinopril on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), plasma renin activity (PRA), and renal hemodynamics in nine patients with chronic renal disease and hypertension, before, and after three months of therapy. Lisinopril normalized blood pressure in five of nine patients (responders) and did not in the remaining four (nonresponders). PRA rose after lisinopril (4.8 +/- 2.6 ng/mL/h to 25 +/- 15 ng/mL/h, P less than 0.05) in responders, but not in nonresponders (2.0 +/- 1.4 ng/mL/h to 3.4 +/- 2.9 ng/mL/h). Glomerular filtration rate remained stable in both groups (responders: 43 +/- 11 mL/min to 43 +/- 22 mL/min; nonresponders: 39 +/- 25 mL/min to 32 +/- 21 mL/min). In the responders renal hemodynamics remained stable after lisinopril (renal plasma flow: 223 +/- 80 mL/min to 216 +/- 91 mL/min; filtration fraction: .20 +/- .04 to .20 +/- .05; renal vascular resistance: 386 +/- 179 to 326 +/- 209 units). In the nonresponders, renal plasma flow decreased (228 +/- 141 mL/min to 162 +/- 117 mL/min, P less than 0.005), filtration fraction increased (.19 +/- .08 to .24 +/- .12, P less than 0.05), and renal vascular resistance increased (695 +/- 747 to 1265 +/- 1574 units, P less than 0.05) after chronic lisinopril therapy. We conclude (1) there is a heterogeneous response to lisinopril in patients with chronic renal disease and hypertension, (2) lisinopril monotherapy may result in effective blood pressure control without renal hemodynamic compromise, and (3) an increase in PRA following converting enzyme inhibition may identify those in whom the circulating renin angiotensin system is participating in systemic hypertension and intrarenal hemodynamic changes.", 
    "195": "Basolateral membranes were prepared from rat renal cortex by density gradient centrifugation. Their purity was confirmed by electron microscopy and by marker enzyme enrichment. The basolateral membrane preparation was shown to be derived predominantly from the proximal renal tubule by measurement of hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase; marked stimulation of adenylate cyclase was found with parathyroid hormone, but not with isoprenaline, antidiuretic hormone or calcitonin. A single class of specific high-affinity [3H]angiotensin II-binding site was identified in the basolateral membrane preparation which, after correction of results for tracer degradation, showed equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.23 nmol/l and binding site concentration of 485.8 fmol/mg protein. Binding sites for [3H]angiotensin II were measured in basolateral membranes prepared from rats fed diets with a low, normal or high sodium content. A trend of increased binding site density with reduced sodium intake was found which did not reach statistical significance. No effect on affinity was demonstrated. Treatment of rats on a low-sodium diet with captopril (500 mg/l drinking water) caused a significant reduction in binding site density; no effect on affinity was demonstrated. These findings suggest that the density of angiotensin II receptors at this site is altered by the activity of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "196": "The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on myocardial ischaemia was studied in 12 normotensive patients with chronic stable angina and exercise induced ST segment depression. The study was randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, and crossover with treatment periods of two weeks. Enalapril was used to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme. Assessment was by angina diaries and maximum symptom limited treadmill exercise tests. The results for the whole group showed a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure at rest and at peak exercise. Mean total exercise duration was 466 s (95% confidence interval 406 to 525) when the patients were taking placebo and 509 s (436 to 583) when they were taking enalapril. Four patients prolonged their total exercise time (mean 450 to mean 591 s) by more than 20%. Two patients, however, developed ischaemia earlier on exercise and reduced their total exercise duration (mean 490 to mean 390 s). Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition tended to reduce myocardial ischaemia in the group as a whole, some patients improved while others deteriorated. Thus the effects of enalapril are variable and this may have important implications when enalapril is used to treat heart failure in patients with underlying severe ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "197": "SCH 39370 (N-[N-[1-(S)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl]-(S)-phenyl-alanyl]-(S)-isoserin e) is a potent and specific inhibitor of neutral metalloendopeptidase (NEP) from rabbit kidney (IC50 = 11.2 +/- 1.9 nM) and is devoid of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity at 1 microM. We evaluated the effect of NEP inhibition with SCH 39370 on the inactivation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and on cardiovascular function in rats. SCH 39370 effectively prevented in vitro degradation of ANF (99-126) by a purified rabbit kidney NEP. SCH 39370 (30 mg/kg s.c) significantly delayed the disappearance of immunoreactive (ir) ANF from plasma in rats after an i.v. infusion of ANF (1 microgram/kg/min for 30 min): the plasma ir ANF level at 15 min postinfusion was 1.5 +/- 0.3 ng/ml vs. 0.3 +/- 0.04 ng/ml in the control. SCH 39370 also delayed the disappearance of ir ANF after infusion of the peptide (0.1 microgram/kg/min for 30 min) which increased plasma levels to those observed during volume expansion. This effect was accentuated markedly in rats with bilateral nephrectomy. The hypotensive response to injection of ANF (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (-38 +/- 6 mm Hg vs. -13 +/- 2 mm Hg in the control) and the diuretic and natriuretic responses to ANF in normal rats were potentiated by SCH 39370 (30 mg/kg s.c.), respectively. The results suggest that NEP can play a role in ANF disposition in vivo and that potentiation of the biological activities of high doses of ANF by SCH 39370 may be consequent to its inhibitory effect on ANF degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "198": "Rats were killed after 6 weeks of continuous ingestion of the pneumotoxic alkaloid monocrotaline (2.2 mg/kg/day), the neutrophil elastase inhibitor SC39026 (60 mg/kg/day), or both. Pulmonary reactions were evaluated by light and electron microscopy. Lung endothelial function was monitored by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, plasminogen activator (PLA) activity, and prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXA2) production. Lung hydroxyproline content was measured as an index of interstitial fibrosis. Cardiac right ventricular hypertrophy was determined by the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum weight ratio (RV/LV + S). Rats receiving SC39026 alone did not differ significantly from untreated control animals with respect to any of the quantitative endpoints, although rarefaction of Type I pneumocytes was observed in the electron micrographs of these animals. Monocrotaline-treated rats, in contrast, developed a significant increase in RV/LV + S, and exhibited pulmonary edema, inflammation, fibrosis, and muscularization and occlusive mural thickening of the pulmonary small arteries and arterioles. These monocrotaline-induced structural changes were accompanied by decreased lung ACE and PLA activities, and increased PGI2 and TXA2 production, and by an increase in lung hydroxyproline content. Cotreatment with SC39026 ameliorated the monocrotaline-induced pulmonary vascular wall thickening and the cardiac right ventricular hypertrophy. These data suggest that inappropriate neutrophil elastase activity contributes to monocrotaline pulmonary vasculopathy and hypertension. On the other hand, cotreatment with SC39026 had no significant effect on the severity of the monocrotaline-induced lung inflammatory reaction, the pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, or the increase in lung hydroxyproline content.", 
    "199": "Diastolic function may be impaired in hypertensives even before alterations occur in systolic function. We studied the effect of a single dose of cilazapril, 5 mg orally, on systolic and diastolic cardiac function in 20 hypertensive patients using a double-blind crossover placebo controlled design. All patients had mild to moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, preserved systolic function and long standing hypertension (for a period of 11.9 +/- 9.0 years). Radionuclide scintigraphy was performed with cilazapril and placebo, given one week apart. A two-week washout period of all cardioactive drugs preceded the study. Within one hour of oral administration of cilazapril blood pressure was significantly lowered. The absolute time to peak filling rate of the left ventricle, as well as the time to peak filling rate expressed as a percentage of diastole, were reduced from 176 +/- 34 to 158 +/- 33 msec (P less than 0.01) and from 46 +/- 10% to 37 +/- 8% (P less than 0.02) (reduction by 9% and 18.4%, respectively). Heart rate, left and right ventricular ejection fraction and peak filling rate was not significantly altered. Placebo had no significant effect. The effect of cilazapril is most probably related to afterload reduction. In conclusion; cilazapril seems to improve diastolic cardiac function in hypertensive patients. Long-term therapy may result in improvement of other, less sensitive indices of diastolic dysfunction.", 
    "200": "1. Streptozotocin diabetes was induced in Wistar-Kyoto rats fed a 50% protein diet. Animals were randomized to receive either the ACE inhibitor ramipril, 1 mg/L in drinking water (n = 7), or no treatment (n = 7) and were studied for 6 months. Blood glucose, body weight and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured at 0, 1, 4, 8 and 16 weeks of diabetes and urinary albumin excretion was measured every 8 weeks. 2. In both groups, GFR increased significantly within 1 week of induction of diabetes (P less than 0.001) and thereafter remained stable. There was no difference in GFR between the treated and untreated groups. 3. Urinary albumin excretion increased progressively in both groups throughout the study. Ramipril treatment reduced albuminuria by approximately 50% at weeks 16 and 24 (P less than 0.01). 4. The amelioration of diabetic albuminuria by ACE inhibition, in the setting of high dietary protein intake, may have important implications for the treatment of human diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "201": "In the present study, we have evaluated whether the hemodynamic effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) infusion in two-kidney, one-clip (2K, 1C) hypertensive rats are mediated by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Hemodynamic determinations were performed by thermodilution in conscious, chronically instrumented animals. ANP (1.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and converting-enzyme (CE) inhibitor captopril (1 mg/kg plus 1 mg.kg-1.h-1), produced a similar fall of blood pressure through different hemodynamic mechanisms. ANP induced hypotension by decreasing cardiac index (CI; from 337.3 +/- 24.9 to 255.1 +/- 21.3 ml.min-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001), whereas a fall in total peripheral resistance (TPR) was observed during CE inhibition (from 0.568 +/- 0.02 to 0.488 +/- 0.02 mmHg.min.ml-1.kg, P less than 0.05). In addition, the ANP-induced decrease in CI was not significantly modified by previous CE inhibition. Furthermore, the decrease in TPR induced by CE inhibition did not change when CE inhibitor was administered during ANP treatment. The results of the present study indicate that the acute hemodynamic responses to ANP in 2K, 1C hypertensive rats are not mediated through antagonism of the vasoconstrictor actions of the RAS.", 
    "202": "Cardiovascular and hormonal responses to aortic cross-clamping (ACC) and declamping (ADC) were studied in 20 patients undergoing reconstructive aortic surgery anesthetized with fentanyl and droperidol. Ten of the patients served as a control group, and 10 patients were treated with oral captopril (25 mg the day before operation and 25 mg one hour before anesthesia) to prevent intraoperative and postoperative hypertension. After the induction of anesthesia in the captopril group, hypotension was seen in four patients and bradycardia in three patients. In both groups, the most important changes in hemodynamics after the ACC were an increase in systemic vascular resistance and decreases in cardiac and stroke index. After the ADC, the cardiac index (CI) improved nearly to the level before the ACC. The urine output during anesthesia was 46 +/- 5 mL/h in the control group and 73 +/- 11 mL/h (P less than 0.05) in the captopril group. Postoperatively, patients in both groups were hypertensive and tachycardic. In the control group, plasma renin activity rose significantly during the ACC, indicating activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In both groups, significant increases in plasma vasopressin (PAVP), epinephrine, and norepinephrine were also observed before the ACC and during the postoperative period. The results suggest that oral captopril increases the risk of hypotension and bradycardia after induction of anesthesia, and does not prevent postoperative hypertension.", 
    "203": "The relationship between the kaolin-induced writhing reaction and production of arachidonate metabolites (PGs) in mice was studied. PGs were released into the peritoneal cavity after intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of kaolin (2.5 mg/mouse) with a peak at 5 min. About 80% of the total amount was 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.8237, p less than 0.001) between the number of writhes and the amount of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The writhing reaction induced by kaolin was significantly inhibited by simultaneous injection of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI; 2.5 mg/mouse) and increased by simultaneous injection of captopril (50 micrograms/mouse). The writing reaction induced by kaolin which was inhibited by oral administration of indomethacin (1 mg/kg) was restored by exogenous i.p. injection of PGI2-Na (2-10 ng/mouse). Indomethacin, ibuprofen and alminoprofen inhibited the writhing reaction and reduced the level of peritoneal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in parallel manner. Tiaramide, pentazocine and morphine inhibited the writhing reaction without reducing the revels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. These results differentiate the site of action of these analgesics. They suggest that the mechanism of the kaolin-induced writhing reaction in mice involves a synergic pain caused by simultaneously released bradykinin and PGI2. This model is a useful tool which allows differentiation of mode of action of analgesics by simultaneous determination of the writhing response and peritoneal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha.", 
    "204": "A compound containing cyclostatine ES-6864 (N-[(2R)-3-morpholinocarbonyl-2-(1-naphthylmethyl)propionyl]-(4-th iazolyl)- L-alanyl-cyclostatine-(2-morpholinoethyl)amide) was found to be a competitive inhibitor of human renin with an inhibitory constant (Ki) value of 7.3 x 10(-9) M. The compound was also potent against monkey renin but was less effective against renins from pig, goat, dog, rabbit and rat. ES-6864 did not inhibit cathepsin D, pepsin, urinary kallikrein, angiotensin converting enzyme, trypsin and chymotrypsin at a concentration of 10(-5) M. ES-6864 also inhibited the tissue renin-like activity from dog tissues with IC50 values of 10(-7)-10(-8) M in vitro. Oral administration of ES-6864 at 30 mg/kg to conscious, sodium-depleted marmosets produced a significant blood pressure reduction and a significant inhibition of plasma renin activity, which persisted for 6 hours. Plasma concentration of ES-6864 reached a maximum of 1.2 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after an oral administration. Oral administration of ES-6864 to hog renin-infused rats produced dose-related decreases in blood pressure. The results demonstrate that ES-6864 is an orally active renin inhibitor with high potency and specificity for human renin. Thus, ES-6864 is a candidate compound for development of renin inhibitors that can be used clinically.", 
    "205": "The involvement of neurokinins, especially substance P, in the opiate withdrawal syndrome was studied by treating rats with drugs that have been reported to increase (captopril) or decrease (capsaicin) tissue levels of substance P. Preliminary experiments with captopril (0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg, SC) showed that the 0.3 mg/kg dose enhanced some of the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs. Captopril alone had no effect in the morphine-dependent rat. On experimental days, either saline or captopril (0.3 mg/kg) was injected (SC) immediately before naloxone in morphine-dependent rats that were pretreated (4 to 10 days before the morphine pellet implantation) with either capsaicin (125 mg/kg, SC) or the capsaicin vehicle (N = 8 for each of 4 groups). Capsaicin treatment inhibited the following withdrawal signs: rhinorrhea, lacrimation and salivation. Captopril increased the occurrence of these secretory responses in vehicle-treated but not in capsaicin-treated animals. Other withdrawal signs were not altered by either captopril or capsaicin treatment. The results support the conclusion that substance P and related neurokinins may be involved in the expression of some signs of opioid withdrawal.", 
    "206": "The effect of four calcium antagonists (nifedipine, nitrendipine, nisoldipine, and verapamil) on hypoxia-induced changes in right ventricular parameters were examined in anesthetized closed-chest rats using an ultraminiature catheterization technique. The effect of the calcium antagonists was compared to the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin, the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril, and the vasodilator nitroglycerin. The animals were exposed to two successive 5-min hypoxic periods separated by a normoxic interval of 60 min, during which the animals received an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of the substances tested. Hypoxia caused a marked rise in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and a moderate increase in RVdP/dtmax. Heart rate (HR) was only slightly enhanced. The functional response to the second hypoxic period did not differ from the first one in NaCl-infused animals. All calcium antagonists reduced the hypoxic pressure increase in a dose-dependent manner and ultimately abolished it. Nisoldipine was the most effective substance, followed by nifedipine, nitrendipine, and verapamil. In contrast, prazosin and propranolol did not influence the hypoxic pressure response. Administration of captopril and nitroglycerin attenuated the increase in RVSP. Thus, as compared with the other substances tested, calcium antagonists were the most effective drugs that antagonized the hypoxia-induced increase in RVSP.", 
    "207": "The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors, trandolapril (RU 44570) and enalapril were administered for 2 weeks to SHR at doses (3 and 10 mg/kg/day, p.o., respectively) that produced important and comparable inhibitions of plasma (84 and 88%), aorta (97 and 88%), and atrium (89 and 82%) CE activities. At these doses, the inhibitory effects of trandolapril and enalapril were nonetheless different on CE in heart ventricle (58 and 72%) and kidney (45 and 85%). In addition, although both drugs reduced blood pressure (BP) and heart hypertrophy, trandolapril was more potent despite a lower dose-ratio. All these parameters were reexamined 1, 3, and 8 days after drug withdrawal: BP returned to control levels within 3 days in enalapril-treated rats, whereas it remained low for at least 8 days in trandolapril-treated animals. The reduction of heart hypertrophy owing to trandolapril was still present 8 days after drug discontinuation. On cessation of treatment, plasma CE increased above controls, ventricle CE returned to control levels within 3 days, whereas atrial and aortic CE activities remained inhibited for 8 days in the enalapril group. In contrast, in trandolapril-treated rats, CE activities in serum and tissues were still inhibited after 8 days. These results demonstrate that at the doses used trandolapril is more potent and longer acting than enalapril.", 
    "208": "We studied the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-dependent and ACE-independent (direct) effects of two ACE inhibitors, cilazaprilat and enalaprilat, in 12 healthy human subjects. The dorsal hand vein compliance technique was used because venous constriction and relaxation, independent of reflex responses and systemic ACE inhibition, can be measured by local infusions of very small amounts of drugs. Angiotensin I (dose range 6-1,550 ng/min) was infused alone or coinfused with cilazaprilat or enalaprilat (dose range 7.8-3,900 ng/min). In separate experiments, cilazaprilat or enalaprilat (dose range 3.9-31 micrograms/min), or prostaglandin I2 (PGI2, dose range 0.13-32 ng/min) was infused into veins that had been submaximally preconstricted with phenylephrine. Angiotensin I caused a marked venoconstriction limited by rapid tachyphylaxis. At doses greater than 78 ng/min, cilazaprilat and enalaprilat completely inhibited angiotensin I-induced venoconstriction. This inhibition was reversible after 14-31 min, suggesting an inhibition of ACE associated with the vein wall. Infusions of cilazaprilat or enalaprilat had no effect on the diameter of the vein at rest or after submaximal preconstriction with phenylephrine. In contrast, exogenous PGI2 was a potent venodilator in our system. We conclude that cilazaprilat and enalaprilat are inhibitors of ACE associated with the vein wall, but there is no evidence for either drug of direct, ACE-independent, prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation.", 
    "209": "CGP 38 560 is a low-molecular-weight (730) inhibitor of human renin that contains only one natural amino acid. In vitro, it is a potent inhibitor of human renin (Ki with tetradecapeptide, 0.4 X 10(-9) M). It has a high enzyme specificity (Ki values against human pepsin, gastricsin, and cathepsin D are 5 X 10(-6), 3 X 10(-6), and 0.6 X 10(-6) M) and is also species specific (IC50 values against human, marmoset, dog, and rat plasma renins are 7 X 10(-10), 7 X 10(-10), 7 X 10(-9), and 1 X 10(-6) M). In vivo, CGP 38 560 inhibits plasma renin activity (PRA) and lowers blood pressure (BP) after oral administration to conscious, normotensive, furosemide-pretreated marmosets. A dose of 10 mg/kg induces complete inhibition of PRA and a decrease in BP of 23 +/- 3 mm Hg (n = 4) after 30 min. These effects persist for up to 2 h. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system appears to cause the hypotensive response since it is completely prevented by pretreatment with a converting-enzyme inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that the molecular size of renin inhibitors may be reduced to improve their oral activity without loss of potency or specificity.", 
    "210": "In previous studies, neutral endopeptidase (NEP) hydrolyzed the Cys105-Phe106 bond of atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) in vitro. Three such ring-opened peptides derived from ANP 99-126, 103-126, and 103-123 were inactive in conscious rats. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in the present study, 100 mumol/kg, intravenously (i.v.) of the NEP inhibitor, SQ 29,072 (7-[[2-(mercaptomethyl)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-propyl]amino]heptanoic acid), significantly increased the area over the curve (AOC) of the depressor response to 3 nmol/kg of ANP 103-126 from 165 +/- 36 to 792 +/- 350, 1,515 +/- 374, and 828 +/- 164 mm Hg.min at 15, 30, and 60 min after inhibitor treatment. Thirty minutes after 3, 10, 30, and 100 mumol/kg of SQ 29,072, the AOC of 3 nmol/kg of ANP 99-126 increased from 175 +/- 59 mm Hg.min in vehicle-treated rats to 296 +/- 100, 318 +/- 34, 632 +/- 194 (p less than 0.05) and 656 +/- 151 (p less than 0.05) mm Hg.min. Furthermore, 100 mumol/kg of SQ 29,072 potentiated the AOC of human ANP 99-126 and 105-126 and rat ANP 99-126, 103-126, and 103-123, suggesting that the exocyclic N-terminal residues and the C-terminal tripeptide did not influence ANP potentiation by SQ 29,072. In contrast, inhibitors of aminopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and serine protease and an arginine vasopressin (AVP) antagonist did not substantially affect the AOC of 3 nmol/kg ANP 99-126. Finally, SQ 29,072 did not alter the activities of bradykinin, AVP, or angiotensin I or II. In conclusion, NEP may inactivate ANP in vivo by cleavage of susceptible bonds within the ANP ring.", 
    "211": "The effects of the converting enzyme inhibitors ramiprilat and enalaprilat on ischemia-induced release of noradrenaline (NA) were examined in the isolated perfused rat heart, submitted to 30 min of total flow restriction followed by 5 min of reperfusion. Ramiprilat (2.6 nM-2.6 microM) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the efflux of NA at reperfusion. The maximal effect (about 70% reduction) was observed at a concentration of 26 nM. In contrast, enalaprilat (10 nM-10 microM) caused no reduction in NA efflux until at a high concentration (10 microM, NA efflux reduced by about 20%). Moreover, the prodrugs ramipril and enalapril (added to the perfusion medium) were without any significant effects on ischemia-induced NA release. Both the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin (0.1 microM) and bradykinin (0.1 and 1 nM) caused marked reductions in ischemic NA efflux. However, when indomethacin (10 microM) was added to the perfusion medium, the effects of bradykinin (1 nM) and ramiprilat (26 nM) on NA efflux were abolished. Likewise, in the presence of angiotensin II (0.1 microM) the effect of ramiprilat was no longer evident. The magnitude of cellular injury, expressed as efflux of creatine kinase during reperfusion, was reduced by bradykinin (0.1 and 1 nM) and by ramiprilat (by about 55% at 2.6 microM). It is concluded that ramiprilat, at therapeutically relevant concentrations, attenuates the ischemia-induced mobilization of NA via a reduction in local angiotensin II production and/or bradykinin degradation. The lack of effect of enalaprilat in this model may reflect differences between converting enzyme inhibitors regarding tissue accumulation or the potency of local enzyme inhibition.", 
    "212": "The study was designed to compare the efficacy of captopril and enalapril, both orally active inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, in the treatment of primary hypertension when administered in a single daily dose. After placebo washout for two weeks, 20 hypertensive patients (I-II class, according to WHO), were admitted to active treatment, in a randomized sequence, with captopril (50 mg) and enalapril (20 mg) once a day in the morning (8 a.m.). Supine and erect blood pressure and heart rate were measured weekly, 24 hours after drug administration by using a mercury standard sphygmomanometer. In all patients ambulatory noninvasive blood pressure monitoring was performed after 4 weeks of treatment. The data confirmed the efficacy of both drugs in lowering blood pressure. However, while the antihypertensive effect of enalapril was prolonged throughout 24 hours, captopril was effective only for about 22 hours, a period longer than previously suggested on the basis of serum ACE inhibition, but not sufficient to cover the whole day. Therefore, if captopril therapy has to be used in a single daily dose an attempt should be made using an increased dosage or by employing the drug in some retarded pharmaceutical form. The need to prolong the antihypertensive effect of captopril to 24 hours is based on the clinical experience according to which the smaller the number of tablets to be taken the better the compliance. This is particularly true for cases of asymptomatic hypertension which nevertheless require lifelong therapy.", 
    "213": "In a preliminary trial, 23 patients in severe left-heart failure and, in some instances, also right-heart failure (NYHA classes III and IV) received a single sublingual dose of 25 mg captopril. Invasive measurement of various haemodynamic parameters indicated (1) an increase in cardiac index and stroke-volume index of 34% and 38%, respectively (P less than 0.001 for each); (2) decrease in pulmonary artery and systemic pressures by an average of 7% and 11.4% (P less than 0.01 and less than 0.001, respectively); (3) no significant change in heart rate and mean right atrial pressure; (4) decrease in systemic and pulmonary artery resistance by 33% and 29% (P less than 0.001 for both); (5) an increase in left ventricular stroke work index by 18% (P less than 0.001); and (6) a fall in heart rate x pressure product by 10% (P less than 0.005). These haemodynamic changes started within 12 to 23 minutes after captopril administration, the peak effect occurring between 40 and 90 minutes. Baseline values were reached after three hours. Reproducibility measurements revealed a close quantitative and temporal correlation (r for all greater than 0.8). To obtain similar changes of cardiac function 1.65 micrograms/min.kg sodium nitroprusside were needed. The results indicate that sublingual administration of captopril in severe heart failure will achieve early and significant improvement in cardiac function.", 
    "214": "The role of a local angiotensin system in the vascular response to arterial injury was investigated by administering the angiotensin-converting enzyme (CE) inhibitor cilazapril to normotensive rats in which the left carotid artery was subjected to endothelial denudation and injury by balloon catheterization. In control animals, by 14 days after balloon injury, the processes of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, migration of SMCs from the media to the intima, and synthesis of extracellular matrix produced marked thickening of the intima, with reduction of the cross-sectional area of the lumen. However, in animals that received continuous treatment with the CE inhibitor, neointima formation was decreased (by about 80 percent), and lumen integrity was preserved. Thus, the angiotensin-converting enzyme may participate in modulating the proliferative response of the vascular wall after arterial injury, and inhibition of this enzyme may have therapeutic applications to prevent the proliferative lesions that occur after coronary angioplasty and vascular surgery.", 
    "215": "Hoe 065, a compound structurally related to inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, caused a fall in the content of acetylcholine (ACh) in different brain areas of the rat following i.p. administration in the range 0.03-30 mg/kg. This effect occurred 0.5 h after a single injection and lasted for at least 6 h. Simultaneous administration of the choline uptake inhibitor hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) with Hoe 065 potentiated the decrease in ACh content induced by HC-3. In the same dose range Hoe 065 acutely enhanced the activity of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase as well as the capacity of the high-affinity choline uptake system which is considered as the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of ACh. Cholinesterase activity in vivo was not altered by the compound. Hoe 065 produced a concurrent elevation of brain cyclic GMP content. Taken together, these results suggest that Hoe 065 acutely increases cholinergic activity within its physiological range, probably by means of an enhanced release of ACh.", 
    "216": "The effects of angiotensin I and II on basal potassium-induced release of [3H]acetylcholine were investigated in slices of rat entorhinal cortex. Potassium (10-25 mM) produced a concentration-dependent increase in the release of [3H]acetylcholine in the presence of extracellular calcium. Angiotensin II (10(-9)-10(-5) M) (but not angiotensin I) reduced the potassium-induced release of [3H]acetylcholine in a concentration-related manner to 60% of control levels, but did not effect basal tritium release. The effect of angiotensin II was antagonised by [1-sarcosine, 8-threonine] angiotensin II, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, but not by agents acting on alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, muscarinic, nicotinic, histamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors nor by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor SQ 29852. The results indicate that angiotensin II acting via an angiotensin II receptor can inhibit the release of [3H]acetylcholine in slices of the rat entorhinal cortex. It is hypothesised that the ability of ACE inhibitors to facilitate cognitive processes may be related to a reduced availability of angiotensin II.", 
    "217": "The pharmacokinetics of the new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril.HCl were evaluated in healthy male volunteers. The single dose kinetics were established from data of 62 subjects receiving an oral 10 mg dose of the drug. The steady state kinetics were investigated in 15 subjects after once-daily oral doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg. The compound is a prodrug which, on absorption, is hydrolysed to the pharmacologically active metabolite benazeprilat. Thus, plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of parent compound and active metabolite were determined. Benazepril.HCl was rapidly absorbed (tmax = 0.5 h) and rapidly eliminated from plasma (t1/2 = 0.6 h). Only trace amounts were excreted unchanged in urine. The drug was rapidly metabolized to benazeprilat (tmax = 1.5 h). The elimination of the metabolite from plasma was biphasic. About 80 per cent of benazeprilat formed was eliminated within 24 h (t 1/2 = 2.7 h), whereas the terminal phase (t1/2 = 22.3 h) controlled a minor amount of elimination. About 17 per cent of dose was excreted in the 24-h urine as benazeprilat. The drug disposition did not change during repeated oral dosing and only small accumulation of the metabolite occurred. The accumulation ratio was 1.20 for AUC and 1.24 for urinary excretion. The effective half-life for accumulation was estimated at about 10-11 h. The comparison with other ACE inhibitors showed similarities but also marked differences with respect to the drug kinetics and excretion.", 
    "218": "To assess factors responsible for phasic behavior of renal blood flow in essential hypertension, we applied an analytic method based on the estimation of power spectral density to xenon transit through the kidney and examined the renal vasodilator response to a range of agents in 53 normal subjects and 53 patients with essential hypertension. The renal vasodilator response to the calcium channel blocking agent diltiazem, but not the response to alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (teprotide or captopril), was associated with a significant reduction in the amplitude of renal vasomotion. Acetylcholine, a vasodilator that acts through the release of a vasorelaxant factor or factors from endothelium, induced an unanticipated increase in renal vasomotion. These observations further dissociate factors responsible for basal renal vascular tone and periodic changes in renal vascular tone and raise the possibility that abnormalities in the flux of calcium into renal arterioles contribute to increased renal vasomotion in essential hypertension.", 
    "219": "In tissues rich in kallikrein, vasodilator kinins, acting as paracrine hormones, may play a role in the local regulation of blood flow. We studied the role of kinins in the regulation of blood flow in the rat submandibular gland using a kinin analogue with antagonistic properties, [DArg0]Hyp3-Thi5-8[DPhe7]bradykinin. When infused into the carotid artery (20 micrograms/min/rat), this antagonist blocked the effect of bradykinin (25-250 ng/kg, intracarotid injection) on glandular blood flow. In nephrectomized rats, the antagonist also blocked the increase in glandular blood flow caused by enalaprilat, a kininase II converting enzyme inhibitor. At a dose of 20 micrograms/min/rat, the antagonist produced no detectable change in basal glandular blood flow; however, at a higher dose (100 micrograms/min/rat), it caused a significant decrease (p less than 0.001). In eight of 10 rats, blood flow decreased by 75% or more; this effect was not blocked by the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine. After antagonist infusion was stopped, blood flow returned toward normal. Sympathetic nerve stimulation of the gland induced vasoconstriction followed by poststimulatory vasodilatation. In rats displaying severe vasoconstriction after the antagonist, postsympathetic vasodilatation was abolished even when stimulation was performed after the antagonist infusion had been stopped and blood flow returned toward normal. Although a direct vasoconstrictor effect of the kinin antagonist cannot be completely ruled out, these data suggest that, in the rat submandibular gland, kinins may play a role in regulation of basal blood flow and vasodilatation after converting enzyme inhibitor or sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "220": "The ACE inhibitors captopril and SQ29,852 enhanced a habituation response to bright illumination in young adult and aged mice measured in a two-compartment light/dark test box. The treatments also antagonised a scopolamine-induced impairment and SQ29,852 was approximately 100 times more potent than captopril. In rats trained on a reinforced alternation paradigm in a T-maze, aged rats, as compared to young adults, showed a reduction in choice performance which was antagonised by SQ29,852. The impairment in choice performance in the T-maze induced by scopolamine in young adult rats was antagonised by SQ29,852 whilst captopril only delayed the onset of the scopolamine-induced impairment. SQ29,852 also antagonised scopolamine-impaired escape latency in a spatial learning/memory paradigm in a water-maze test. The effects of SQ29,852 in the rat were achieved within a somewhat restricted dose range. The ability of captopril and SQ29,852 to increase performance in the behavioural tests is discussed in terms of an antagonism of angiotensin converting enzyme to remove an inhibitory role of angiotensin II on central cholinergic function.", 
    "221": "Acute hemodynamic effects of intravenous captopril were measured, and left ventricular function was analyzed by radionuclide angiography in 11 patients with moderate to severe hypertension. All subjects received 1 mg captopril bolus injection initially, and followed in 10 minutes intervals by 2 mg or 5 mg injections according to their blood pressure response. Eight patients experienced an acute reduction of blood pressure; three patients remained unresponsive. The onset of action occurred within 5 minutes with peak effect at 5 to 10 minutes and a duration of action of 20 to 30 minutes. The hemodynamic effects were characterized by arteriolar dilation (reduced systemic vascular resistance P less than 0.01), and apparent venous dilatation (reduced right atrial, pulmonary wedge pressure P less than 0.05 & 0.01 respectively). Pulmonary vascular resistance was not altered. Ejection fraction remained unchanged. Isovolumic relaxation period lengthened (109 +/- 20.1 vs 137.39 +/- 21.15 msec, P less than 0.05) and coronary perfusion pressure gradients dropped (113.8 +/- 5.6 vs 101.1 +/- 11.3 mmHg P less than 0.001) following intravenously administered captopril. Intravenous captopril may reduce arterial pressure by inducing arterial dilatation with minimal adverse effect. The prolongation of isovolumic relaxation period should mainly attribute to the decrease of coronary filling load.", 
    "222": "In patients with well-functioning renal allografts, the presence of diseased native kidneys appears to be a common cause of elevated blood pressure. We evaluated the role of native kidneys in post-transplant hypertension using a rat model in which the confounding variables of rejection and immunosuppression could be eliminated. To produce disease in native kidneys. PVG rats were subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy. Four weeks following renal ablation, these hypertensive animals were transplanted with kidneys from syngeneic PVG donors. Four weeks later, the effects of captopril and native nephrectomy on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics were examined. Animals with remnant native kidneys which received non-rejecting renal isografts had sustained hypertension, elevated plasma renin levels and reduced transplant function. In these animals, administration of captopril reduced systemic blood pressure. Despite the reduction in blood pressure, PAH clearance by the transplanted kidney increased markedly while GFR rose modestly. Removal of the remnant native kidney also acutely lowered blood pressure. However, compared to captopril, native nephrectomy produced a more marked increase in GFR without significantly affecting renal blood flow. In this model of post-transplant hypertension in the rat, elevated blood pressure and reduced isograft function are mediated by the diseased native kidney, in part through the effects of angiotensin II. These data suggest that ACE inhibitors and native nephrectomy may have beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with post-transplant hypertension caused by native kidneys.", 
    "223": "The effect of antihypertensive treatment on blood-retinal barrier leakage of fluorescein in background retinopathy was studied in nine hypertensive Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients suffering from nephropathy. The patients were investigated before and after 7 (3 to 13) months of treatment with captopril (n = 8; 25 to 100 mg daily) and a diuretic, either frusemide (n = 4; 80 to 200 mg daily) or bendrofluazide (n = 2; 2.5 mg daily). Retinal function was assessed by fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, vitreous fluorometry, and renal function by glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuria. The antihypertensive treatment induced a significant reduction (p less than 0.05) in: blood pressure from 152/97 +/- 14/8 mmHg to 134/82 +/- 11/6 mmHg; blood-retinal barrier leakage of fluorescein from 2.4 +/- 1.1 to 1.4 +/- 0.5.10(-7) cm/second; albuminuria from 1391 (range: 168-4852) micrograms/min to 793 (range: 35-2081) micrograms/min. Glomerular filtration rate declined from 88 +/- 15 to 78 +/- 23 ml.min-1.1.73 m2 (0.05 less than p less than 0.10). The metabolic control of the patients as reflected by their blood glucose and HbA1c levels remained stable during the study. Our study suggests that systemic blood pressure elevation contributes to the abnormal blood-retinal barrier permeability to fluorescein characteristically found in diabetic background retinopathy and that this abnormality can be reversed during antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "224": "Measurement of immunoreactive plasma renin concentration (PRC) using direct radioimmunoassay (RIA) was compared with the common procedure, measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA). The sensitivity of the PRC assay was 5 pg/ml. In 67 normal subjects aged 45.2 +/- 1.2 year, the mean PRC value was 17.0 +/- 0.9 pg/ml in the recumbent position and 38.0 +/- 5.4 pg/ml in the upright position. In patients with high renin essential hypertension and renovascular hypertension, discrepancies were observed between changes in PRA and PRC at 60 min after the administration of captopril. In a patient with Bartter's syndrome PRC was markedly elevated (393 pg/ml) and the changes in PRA and in PRC after captopril were very different (452% vs. 1249%). In all 10 cases of primary hyperaldosteronism PRC was less than 5 pg/ml. The correlation coefficient between PRC and PRA was 0.85 (n = 227, p less than 0.01). The slope of the regression line between PRA and PRC decreased in proportion to PRC values. Direct RIA for PRC is likely to be useful for the determination of plasma active renin when renin levels are high or substrate concentrations are abnormal. Moreover, the combined use of PRA and PRC measurements might be useful in assessing abnormalities in renin substrate concentration as well as in PRC.", 
    "225": "Any type of chronic renal disease is associated with functional deterioration of the kidney due to progressive glomerulosclerosis with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. This process is thought to be predominantly due either to glomerular hyperfiltration or mesangial overload with macromolecules. Antihypertensive therapy, particularly with ACE inhibitors, and protein restriction have been found to retard progressive glomerulosclerosis in animal experiments. There is no doubt that patients with renal disease benefit from antihypertensive therapy through both preservation of renal function and prevention of secondary organ damage due to hypertension. However, the value of protein restricted diets with or without supplements of essential amino acids or ketoacids is less clear. A patient treated with protein restriction is presented and the investigations necessary to monitor compliance, renal function and nutrition are discussed. Monthly to quarterly controls of renal function, blood pressure and mineral metabolism are suggested, particularly in the case of severe hypertension and of prophylactic treatment for renal osteodystrophy with phosphate binders and vitamin D metabolites. Finally, guidelines are provided for planning of renal replacement therapy by dialysis and renal transplantation in the individual patient.", 
    "226": "Renal hemodynamics in heart failure and the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on renal function are reviewed. The incidence of renal dysfunction in patients with congestive heart failure is relatively high; however, the incidence of progression of renal dysfunction during treatment with ACE inhibitors is low. The mild reduction in renal function initially observed represents the physiologic expression of blocking both the systemic and the intrarenal compensatory activities of the renin-angiotensin system. Despite small changes in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine noted following initiation of enalapril therapy in the two studies described, there was no further clinically significant increase in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine noted during continued treatment in the majority of patients, irrespective of baseline renal function. The use of enalapril as adjunctive therapy with digitalis and diuretics in patients with congestive heart failure, with appropriate adjustment of the dosages of these agents, may benefit many patients.", 
    "227": "The efficacy and safety of nicardipine were assessed in 29,104 hypertensive patients (mean age, 64 years) during a 90-day multicenter clinical trial. By treatment day 90, blood pressure was controlled in 60% of the patients taking nicardipine alone. The efficacy of nicardipine combined with another antihypertensive agent was examined in 6,479 of the patients. When nicardipine was added to their treatment regimen, blood pressure was controlled by day 90 in 63% of the patients taking beta-blockers, in 58% of those on diuretics, in 50% of those on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and in 49% of those taking centrally acting antihypertensive agents. Nicardipine was well tolerated; only 11% of the 29,104 patients discontinued treatment because of side effects. Most adverse reactions were transient and were related to vasodilation, and included peripheral edema in 7% of the patients, flushing in 7%, and headache in 4%. The results indicate that nicardipine is suitable as initial therapy in arterial hypertension.", 
    "228": "Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid (AMCA) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man. Injection of Captopril (1 mg/kg), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model. The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent. The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed, indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein. Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril. The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone. It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin (secondary to an increase in bradykinin). Captopril may, by the same mechanism, reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli, with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced.", 
    "229": "The effect of captopril on diuretic requirements was assessed in 16 patients with moderate (13 NYHA Class III, 1 NYHA Class II) or severe (3 NYHA Class IV) stable non-oedematous chronic heart failure. The dose of diuretics was halved before captopril was started and follow-up was continued for two months. In all three patients in NYHA Class IV the diuretic dosage had to be increased to a dose close to, or the same as, the original dose of diuretics in order to keep them from congestive heart failure. One patient improved on the new regime but gained 3.5 kg in weight during follow-up. Of the 13 patients with moderate heart failure, seven showed an improvement in symptoms and exercise duration on the combination of captopril and the lower dose of diuretics (mean 6.9 to 12.5 min, P less than 0.001); two patients did not improve and gained 1.7 kg and 2.3 kg in weight, respectively; three patients required the original dose of diuretics to keep them from congestive heart failure and one patient lost weight on the reduced dose of diuretics but showed no improvement clinically or on treadmill exercise testing. Thus captopril does not have a diuretic sparing effect in patients with severe chronic heart failure. Those treated need the original dose of diuretics for maximal symptomatic benefit. Captopril does have a diuretic sparing effect in some patients with moderate chronic heart failure.", 
    "230": "Although verapamil is a well-established treatment for angina, cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies, this review reflects current interest in calcium antagonists as anti-hypertensive agents by focusing on the role of verapamil in hypertension. Verapamil is a phenylalkylamine derivative which antagonises calcium influx through the slow channels of vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cell membranes. By reducing intracellular free calcium concentrations, verapamil causes coronary and peripheral vasodilation and depresses myocardial contractility and electrical activity in the atrioventricular and sinoatrial nodes. Verapamil is well suited for the management of essential hypertension since it produces generalised systemic vasodilation resulting in a marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance and, consequently, blood pressure. Evidence from clinical studies supports the role of oral verapamil as an effective and well-tolerated first-line treatment for the management of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Clinical studies have shown that verapamil is more effective the higher the pretreatment blood pressure and some authors have found a more pronounced antihypertensive effect in older patients or in patients with low plasma renin activity. Sustained release verapamil formulations are available for oral administration which, as a single daily dose, are as effective in lowering blood pressure over 24 hours as equivalent doses of conventional verapamil formulations given 3 times daily. As a first-line antihypertensive agent, oral verapamil is equivalent to several other calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other vasodilators, and is not associated with many of the common adverse effects of these treatments. Verapamil may be preferred as an alternative first-line antihypertensive treatment to diuretics in elderly patients because it has similar efficacy in these patients without causing the adverse effects commonly linked with diuretic treatment. Furthermore, because verapamil does not cause bronchoconstriction, it may be used in preference to beta-blockers in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive airway disease. Reflex tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension or development of tolerance is not evident following verapamil administration. As a second- or third-line treatment for patients refractory to established antihypertensive regimens, verapamil produces marked blood pressure reductions when combined with diuretics and/or ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and vasodilators such as prazosin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "231": "Nine hypertensive patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction were entered into a protocol to assess the blood pressure, humoral and renal effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, Benazepril (CGS14824A, 2 to 20 mg twice daily) in patients with hypertension and moderate renal insufficiency (mean creatinine clearance 56 ml/min/1.73 m2). Specifically monitored, prior to and following 12 weeks of Benazepril monotherapy, were plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone, the clearances of creatinine, Tc99m-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (TC99m-DTPA) and para-amino-hippurate, and the 24-hour urinary excretion of protein. Blood pressure was well controlled. Plasma renin activity was stimulated, and plasma aldosterone was suppressed. Mean serum potassium increased from 3.9 to 4.2 mEq/L. Benazepril monotherapy had no adverse renal hemodynamic effect. Benazepril appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent in hypertensive patients with moderately impaired renal function.", 
    "232": "IL-2 release from mouse splenocytes was measured by assaying the IL-2 on an IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte line in culture (CTLL). Proliferation of the CTLL cells was monitored indirectly with the dye thiazolyl blue. The slow-acting anti-rheumatic drug auranofin at concentrations below 0.1 microM potentiated concanavalin A (Con A)-induced IL-2 release. Similar potentiation of Con A-induced IL-2 release was obtained with D-penicillamine, 1 microM-1 mM, and with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor captopril, 10 nM-1 microM. Potentiation of Con A-induced IL-2 release was obtained with concentrations of the drugs likely to be achieved in vivo during therapy. Auranofin but not D-penicillamine and captopril inhibited Con A-induced IL-2 release at high concentrations (greater than 0.3 microM).", 
    "233": "Cerebral blood flow and metabolism have been studied in 11 patients during general anaesthesia and hypotension induced with sodium nitroprusside in combination with captopril. Cerebral blood flow was measured, using a Novo Cerebrograph model 10A, after injection of 133 xenon into an arm vein. Arterial and venous blood samples were drawn to calculate cerebral metabolism. Captopril 1 mg.kg-1 orally was given one hour before induction of anaesthesia. The sodium nitroprusside doses ranged between 0.16 and 3.23 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Mean arterial pressure was reduced 26 per cent to 46 mmHg during hypotension. It is concluded that for the group as a whole there were no changes in CBF and CMRO2 during hypotension. In one patient, however, critical low CBF measurements were recorded during and after hypotension. This indicates the need for further studies concerning the cerebral haemodynamic consequences of captopril and SNP-induced hypotension.", 
    "234": "Renal disease from a variety of causes often progresses to end-stage renal failure. The progression may be caused by factors accompanying, but not initiating, renal injury. These factors include glomerular hyperfiltration, glomerular hypertension, systemic hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Studies, primarily in animals, indicate that causative factors may be altered by control of systemic hypertension, dietary protein restriction, administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers, and plasma lipid control. Whether such interventions will significantly alter progressive renal disease in humans is, as yet, uncertain.",

    "237": "Angiotensin II stimulates prolactin release both in vivo in the rat and in vitro in anterior pituitary cell cultures. Moreover, angiotensin II binding sites have been identified in pituitary lactotrophs and it has been shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is present in rat anterior pituitary. We studied the effect of enalapril, a potent converting enzyme inhibitor, on baseline prolactin levels in nine hypertensive postmenopausal women. The results indicate that 15-day inhibition of ACE by enalapril reduced prolactinaemia, suggesting that angiotensin II plays a role in the control of prolactin secretion in hypertensives.", 
    "238": "In order to compare the efficacy of beta-blocking, diuretics and ACE-inhibiting monotherapy in controlling the blood pressure increase to stress, a study was conducted on 30 subjects (10 treated with atenolol, 10 with hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride combination, 10 with enalapril) with mild or moderate essential hypertension whose resting blood pressures were normalised by therapy. In the 3 groups of subjects blood pressure values at rest, during mental stress, static and dynamic exercise did not significantly differ before antihypertensive therapy. Atenolol and enalapril significantly reduced systolic and diastolic pressure below pretreatment values throughout and immediately after each test, differing from diuretic therapy which did not show any significant reduction in diastolic rises at the peak of hand-grip or in both systolic and diastolic pressures at the highest work-loads during dynamic exercise. In the recovery period of the exercise cycle test diuretics also produced a later normalisation of diastolic pressure. In conclusion, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors seem to be more effective than diuretics in the control of the blood pressure response to stress in hypertensive patients, suggesting that these drugs are the first choice treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "239": "Malignant hypertension developed in an 18-year-old man whose primary hypertension had been diagnosed by chance. Standing blood pressure was 290/170 mmHg. Tests of renal function revealed high blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and low levels of both effective renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate. Plasma renin activity and levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone were greatly elevated. Severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy was noted. The patient received standard antihypertensive treatment with furosemide, propranolol, nifedipine, and prazosin, but his blood pressure did not decrease and there was no improvement in the clinical or biochemical measures. The patient was then given 20 mg of enalapril daily for one year. The inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme immediately reduced blood pressure. Angiotensin II and aldosterone levels became normal, kidney function and hemodynamics improved, and echocardiograms revealed that the left ventricular hypertrophy had regressed. The results confirm the pathogenetic role of angiotensin II in the development of the malignant phase of hypertension.", 
    "240": "The effects of captopril, rentiapril, and alacepril were compared in five patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) and five with essential hypertension (EH). The dose of each drug was equivalent to 50 mg of captopril. Rentiapril inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme activity more strongly and for longer periods than did the other two drugs. In the patients with RVH, blood pressure was significantly reduced more quickly and for longer periods by rentiapril than by captopril or alacepril; in the patients with EH, alacepril was the most potent antihypertensive agent. The results indicate that rentiapril is as effective as the other two drugs in patients with hypertension and that alacepril is more effective in patients with low-renin hypertension or renin-independent hypertension than captopril or rentiapril.",

The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of perindopril (8 mg oral) and perindoprilat (2 mg intravenously) were studied in a double-blind randomised crossover study in a group of patients with compensated biopsy-proven hepatic cirrhosis. 3. Blood pressure and heart rate responses were similar after the two routes of administration as were plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels following dosing. 4. The AUC of perindoprilat after oral administration of perindopril represented 46 +/- 4% of the total AUC of perindopril and its metabolite when expressed in molar terms. Comparison with the AUC of perindoprilat after its intravenous administration suggested that 30 +/- 6% of the oral dose of perindopril was converted to its active metabolite. 5. The findings are comparable with those in healthy subjects. It appears that the presence of relatively mild hepatic cirrhosis does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of perindopril.",

Subtracting area under the extrapolated terminal phase of the serum profile from zero to infinity retained the linear relationship, but shifted the regression line to a zero intercept. It is postulated that the terminal phase reflects binding of drug to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The half-life for the terminal phase (approximately 40 h) was not predictive of steady-state parameters when ten daily doses (q24h) of lisinopril were administered orally to healthy volunteers. The mean effective half-life for accumulation was 12.6 h. The mean accumulation ratio was 1.38. Steady state was attained after the second daily dose.

We present two cases of oropharyngeal angioedema associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with no underlying renal failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibiting agents are now commonly used to control hypertension. Treatment of acquired angioedema is directed first at protecting the airway by careful observation, intubation, or if necessary, tracheostomy. The causative agent is withdrawn, and the patient is treated with antihistamines and steroids until the acute episode resolves. Although not used in our patients, the treatment of angioedema with subcutaneous epinephrine has been described. As more patients are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, it becomes essential for the otolaryngologist to become aware of this potentially life-threatening complication.",

Three hundred seventy-eight family physicians treated 3608 mild and moderate hypertensives with one of the following medications: atenolol (n = 564 patients), enalapril maleate (n = 677), verapamil hydrochloride in sustained-release form (n = 1861), or a fixed combination, hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene (n = 506). The resultant four groups of patients differed in several demographic and clinical measures: age, gender, race, concurrent disease, diastolic and systolic blood pressures, heart rate, and history of hypertension. The patient profiles for each group suggest appropriate matching of drugs to individual patient needs: younger patients and those with higher heart rates more often received the beta-blocker; blacks were more frequently assigned to the diuretic and less often to the beta-blocker; patients with concurrent diseases and a longer history of hypertension were more often assigned to the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or the calcium channel blocker. Rates of success, defined by the percentages of patients staying on the selected drug and experiencing a reduction of at least 10 mmHg or achieving a diastolic pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg, were in the same range for all four groups (55 to 62.5 percent). Patients evaluated their quality of life and gave enalapril and verapamil SR the highest ratings. The rapid completion of the study, the quality of the results, and the high rates of follow-up and compliance show that family practice is an excellent setting for conducting clinical research.",

The ratings for each component are added to form an aggregated score, which can range from 0, for the worst condition, to 12, for the best. Because dyspnea and fatigue are prime symptoms and sources of clinical distress, the index helps reflect the quality of life in patients with congestive heart failure. In double-blind trials of therapy, changes in the index showed good correlations with patients' self-selected ratings of improvement. The posttherapeutic changes in the index ratings were significantly higher with a new active agent (lisinopril) than with placebo or another active agent (captopril).",

Explants showed good viability in culture (greater than 80%), and demonstrated net production of aldosterone, angiotensin II, and prorenin. Aldosterone production was consistently stimulated by an increase in potassium (6 mM) in the culture medium. Both aldosterone and angiotensin II production could be attenuated by adding the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril to the culture medium (0.1 mM). These data suggest that rat adrenal explants are capable of producing all of the components of a functional renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and that these components can interact in response to physiological stimuli. These findings support the hypothesis that a local adrenal renin system may play a physiological role in the control of adrenal aldosterone production.", 
    "256": "We compared the antihypertensive effects of the beta-blocker atenolol and the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril during 12 weeks of treatment in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Atenolol (n = 10) significantly decreased conventionally measured blood pressure from 144/103 to 135/93 mm Hg and lisinopril (n = 9) from 150/104 to 130/92 mm Hg. Based on data derived from automated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, atenolol decreased the average whole-day systolic pressure by 18 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than 0.02) and the diastolic pressure by 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Lisinopril produced decreases of 27 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and 13 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Examination of the 24-h blood pressure patterns showed that the efficacies of the two drugs were similar. Each appeared to be effective throughout the whole-day monitoring period, although only lisinopril significantly decreased blood pressure during the final four-h period (4 AM to 8 AM) preceding the next day's dose. Neither drug produced significant echocardiographic changes in left ventricular wall thickness or muscle mass during the short-term treatment. Lisinopril and atenolol effectively decrease blood pressure during a 24-h period. Moreover, we found that automated whole-day blood pressure monitoring is a useful tool for comparing the efficacy and duration of action of differing antihypertensive agents.", 
    "257": "The purpose of this multicenter randomised, double-blind and cross-over study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of labetalol (L) and captopril (C) in 42 moderate hypertensive patients (mean age: 52 years). The drugs were given during two 4-weeks periods at the end of which the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) were measured at rest in supine and standing positions. The assessment of the quality of life was realized with 4 scales completed by the practitioner [anxiety, depression, well-being, visual analog scale (VAS)] and 4 scales of auto-assessment completed by the patient [2 VAS, well-being, sub-scale of pleasure]. At the end of the first treatment's period (D28), both drugs had decreased significantly supine SBP and DBP (p less than 0.001), standing DBP (L = p less than 0.01; C = p less than 0.05), while only L lowered supine SBP (p less than 0.01). The cross-over analysis was unable to conclude, due to the number of patients and a significant interaction which reduced its power. Thus the effect of the first treatment's period seemed to influence the efficacy of the second one. The percentages of patients with a controlled BP were respectively: after 4 weeks of treatment, L = 61 p. 100 vs C = 42 p. 100 and at the end of study (D56), L = 67 p. 100 vs C = 64 p. 100.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "258": "In eleven hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis, the acute renal effects of captopril were investigated using two methods: 1) the Tc99m-DTPA renography with determination of an index of renal perfusion (IP), an index of glomerular filtration (IF) and the ratio of these indices (F/P); 2) the renal hemodynamics obtained by the clearance method using a continuous infusion of I131-hippuran and I125-iothalamate for calculation of renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and filtration fraction (FF). The studies were performed before and after captopril treatment. Patients were classified according to the acute response to captopril as responders (R; n = 6) and non responders (NR; n = 5). Results are as follows: (B: basal, C = captopril). (table; see text) These data confirm that captopril produced a significant decrease in F/P and FF in R whereas these indices did not change in NR; it was found that IF and GFR decreased in R whereas IF increased and GFR did not change in NR; a significant correlation was observed between delta IF and delta GFR in R (r = 0.834, p less than 0.05). These results indicate that 1) data obtained before and after captopril by renography and by clearance methods are in good correlation either in Ror in NR patients; 2) Captopril test including renography or renal hemodynamic measurements is useful for selection of R patients.", 
    "259": "Fatigue, that cardinal symptom of heart failure, expresses muscle deconditioning and is becoming the main complaint of our patients. Dyspnoea also is, at least partially, a consequence of muscle deconditioning; however, the wide use of diuretics which reduce water and salt retention has improved the \"pump\" function an therefore dyspnoea. The \"muscle deconditioning\" syndrome in heart failure has two causes: reduction of the nutritive blood flow in skeletal muscle, and specific alteration of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The syndrome appears only after a lasting reduction of physical activities. Its anatomical substrate is a mild muscular fibrosis and, mainly, reduced area of oxidative mitochondrial cristae. It remains for approximately three months, which accounts for the delayed improvement of exercise tolerance under vasodilatator treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. This syndrome explains the success of retraining techniques which, in ou opinion, should become part of our therapeutic armamentarium.", 
    "260": "To establish a model of hypertension in marmosets, increasing doses of the immune-modulator cyclosporin (from 3 to 30 mg/kg/day) were given orally to marmosets for 31 days. Cyclosporin consistently induced hypertension with doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day. Time course and level of hypertension reached were dose-dependent. Hypertension was not associated with an increase of plasma renin activity (PRA) or plasma creatinine concentration and was sensitive to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by cilazapril (10 mg/kg p.o.). After cyclosporin treatment was stopped, hypertension regressed. We conclude that hypertension can consistently be induced in marmosets by chronic treatment with cyclosporin.", 
    "261": "A random national survey of 50 general practitioners was undertaken to ascertain current trends in the pharmacological management of hypertension. Forty general practitioners entered the study, and scripts written by them over a two month period in 1988 were collected and recorded by the pharmaceutical pricing offices of the health department. The general practitioners provided details on whether the script had been written for hypertension, as well as the age and sex of the patients. Information from 37 general practitioners was available for study, involving 2675 scripts written for hypertension for 1858 patients. Sixty point two percent of the treated hypertensives were female, and 58.9% were aged over 60 years. The most commonly prescribed antihypertensives were the diuretics (47.1% of patients) and beta blockers (47.9%). They were followed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (18.2%) and calcium antagonists (9.7%). There was substantial variability in the prescription of antihypertensives with respect to the age and sex of the patients treated; the mean costs and duration of supply of different generic drug types; and the prescribing habits of general practitioners. By generic type, the mean monthly costs of therapy ranged from $3.77 (diuretics) to $48.19 (calcium antagonists). The age and sex adjusted geometric mean script costs ranged from $17.78 to $49.11 per month (median: $29.30). It seems unlikely that the observed degree of variability is explained by differences in the severity of hypertension between general practice populations.", 
    "262": "Spirally cut strips of arteries and veins were prepared from the rabbit or the dog and superfused in cascade. Venous strips were more sensitive to endothelin-1 (ET-1) than arterial ones and, in particular, the rabbit jugular and the rabbit mesenteric veins were contracted by as little as 0.5-2.5 pmol of ET-1 in a reproducible and dose-dependent way. The calcium agonist Bay K 8644 had a different profile of activity on the vascular strips, being more potent on the rabbit mesenteric artery than on the rabbit jugular or mesenteric veins. Nicardipine (10(-7) M) did not affect the ET-1-induced vascular contractions but abolished the contractile activity of Bay K 8644. Contractions induced by ET-1 were not affected by the kininase II inhibitor captopril in the rabbit jugular veins but were potentiated by methylene blue in both veins of the rabbit. Our results indicate that ET-1 potently contracts venous and arterial isolated vessels via the activation of specific receptors or channels that differ from the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels. The fact that ET-1 is more active on venous than on arterial smooth muscle may have important pathophysiological implications.", 
    "263": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were excised from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) preparations of tuna and porcine muscles by heating at 120 degrees C for 5 min in 1 M AcOH-20 mM HCl. The inhibitors were then purified by successive chromatographies. The final product from tuna was identified as Pro-Thr-His-Ile-Lys-Trp-Gly-Asp, which was the ACE inhibitor obtained from tuna muscle [Kohama et al. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 155, 332-337]. The porcine ACE inhibitor was found to be Pro-Ala-Asn-Ile-Lys-Trp-Gly-Asp, which was identical to the porcine muscle GAPDH peptide 79-86. These results strongly suggested that the ACE inhibitory octapeptides derived from GAPDH proteins by acid-limited proteolysis at Asp-Pro and Asp-Ala peptide bonds.",

We present 5 patients with persistent dry cough severe enough to warrant withdrawal of the drug, which resulted in rapid and complete recovery. Challenge with the drugs induced recurrence of cough. The pathogenesis of the reaction is unknown, but possible mediators include bradykinin and prostaglandins.", 
    "265": "The hemodynamic responses to endothelin, a recently isolated vasoconstrictor peptide, were determined in conscious rats with and without the three major known neurohumoral control systems. Rats (n = 6) were instrumented with arterial and venous catheters and an electromagnetic flow probe around the ascending aorta. Neurohumoral blockade was achieved with 10 mg/kg chlorisondamine, 0.5 mg/kg methscopolamine, 1 mg/kg captopril, and 10 micrograms/kg d(CH2)Tyr5(Me)AVP. Resting mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) in areflexic rats were restored to normal levels with a constant norepinephrine infusion. Endothelin was infused intravenously for 25 min in doses ranging from 0.01 to 1,000 ng.kg-1.min-1. Rats with intact reflexes did not respond significantly until a dose of 100 ng.kg-1.min-1 that increased MAP 20%, decreased CO 22% and increased TPR 58%. At a dose of 1,000 ng.kg-1.min-1 of endothelin (infused for 10 min), MAP increased 35%, CO decreased 66%, and TPR increased 303%. In areflexic rats, 1 ng.kg-1.min-1 of endothelin caused significant increases in MAP (14%), small decreases in CO (-5%), and a 20% increase in TPR. At a dose of 10 ng.kg-1.min-1, MAP increased 17%, CO decreased 3%, and TPR increased 21%; at 100 ng.kg-1.min-1, MAP increased 40%, CO decreased 13%, and TPR increased 67%; at 1,000 ng.kg-1.min-1, MAP increased 48%, CO decreased 61%, and TPR increased 319%. The pressor effects of endothelin were therefore significantly buffered by neurohumoral systems; however, the decreases in CO caused by high doses of endothelin were independent of neurohumoral control.", 
    "266": "Tachykinins produced a concentration-related contraction of the isolated guinea-pig gallbladder, with a rank order of potency neurokinin A (NKA) greater than Arg-neurokinin B = neurokinin B (NKB) greater than substance P (SP). Only the effect of SP was potentiated by thiorphan (0.1-10 microM). A significant enhancement of the response to SP was also produced by captopril (1 microM). [Nle10]NKA-(4-10) and [beta-Ala8]NKA-(4-10), selective NK-2 receptor agonists, were active, whereas [Pro9]SP sulfone (selective NK-1 agonist) was almost ineffective. [MePhe7]NKB (selective NK-3 agonist) had some activity but only at high concentrations. Septide was almost ineffective and DiMeC7 had an action comparable to that of [MePhe7]NKB. None of the effects induced by these synthetic tachykinin analogs were significantly potentiated by thiorphan. Capsaicin (10 microM) produced a contraction which was unaffected by thiorphan. Both capsaicin and NKA-induced contractions were antagonized by Spantide at concentrations (5-10 microM) which had no effect against the atropine-sensitive contractions produced by electrical field stimulation. Capsaicin (1 microM) produced a consistent release of SP-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) and a second application of the drug had no further effect, indicating complete desensitization. SP-LI release by capsaicin was almost doubled in the presence of thiorphan. These findings indicate that NK-2 and possibly some NK-3 receptors mediate the contractile response of the guinea-pig gallbladder to tachykinins. Both exogenous and endogenous (released by capsaicin) SP were degraded to a significant extent in this organ via a thiorphan-sensitive mechanism, the identity of which remains to be established.", 
    "267": "This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of the efficacy and safety of dilevalol, 200 mg (n = 86), compared with enalapril, 20 mg (n = 92), administered once daily to patients with mild hypertension. Three weeks of placebo washout were followed by 4 weeks of comparative treatment. Beginning with the first week of treatment, both drugs substantially decreased blood pressure from baselines of approximately 160/100 mm Hg. Decreases in systolic pressure were comparable throughout treatment, but dilevalol tended to have a greater effect on diastolic pressure. At the end of double-blind treatment, average decreases in blood pressure with dilevalol and enalapril were 16/13 and 16/11 mm Hg supine and 15/13 and 15/10 mm Hg standing (p = 0.03 for between-group comparisons of standing diastolic pressure). More dilevalol- than enalapril-treated patients achieved a diastolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg; 73 vs 55% (p = 0.02) supine, and 69 vs 43% (p less than 0.01) standing. The safety profiles of the 2 drugs were comparable. The incidence of adverse effects was low, and few patients discontinued treatment. Headache and gastrointestinal discomfort were reported in both groups. Average postural changes in blood pressure were similar to baseline. Electrocardiographic changes were rare and not treatment related. Changes in laboratory test results were minor. Heart rate decreased modestly with dilevalol relative to enalapril (6 vs 2 to 3 beats/min; p less than 0.01), but no bradycardia was observed.", 
    "268": "The activity of serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) for healthy horses was 64 +/- 13 mUnits/ml. In vitro, equine serum ACE was sensitive to the following inhibitors (IC50): enalapril (570 nM or 215 ng/ml), captopril (190 nM or 41.3 ng/ml), and enalaprilat (6 nM or 2.1 ng/ml). The intravenous (i.v.) administration of angiotensin I to six healthy horses produced a dose proportional pressor response. The maximal increase in mean arterial pressure over baseline values was 65.6 mmHg at angiotensin I doses of 500 ng/kg bodyweight (bwt). The attenuation of this response to angiotensin I was further demonstrated in a single horse by the prior administration of enalaprilat at an i.v. dose of 8.71 micrograms/kg bwt.", 
    "269": "Perindopril, a new specific and potent inhibitor of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme was used to evaluate the possible participation of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of aminoglycoside-induced renal failure. Kidney function, morphology and biochemistry were evaluated at regular intervals throughout the study. Perindopril was given orally to rats at a daily dose of 2 mg/kg for 15 days prior to and during 15 day gentamicin treatment given intraperitoneally at a daily dose of 50 mg/kg. Perindopril treatment alone induced no modification in renal function or structure. Gentamicin treatment alone induced typical renal lesions which were scored as moderate and a slight but significant decrease in ACE blood levels. Concurrent treatment with perindopril and gentamicin induced a greater drop in ACE blood levels than after the administration of perindopril alone and produced more marked renal impairment than after the administration of gentamicin alone. These observations suggest that the integrity of the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in limiting kidney injury during aminoglycoside induced nephrotoxicity.", 
    "270": "Taste and smell disturbances are infrequently reported adverse effects of treatment with captopril and are even less frequently reported with other ACE inhibitors. These adverse effects have been attributed to the chemical structure of the drugs used, although this relationship is the matter of some debate. A link between the taste disturbance associated with ACE inhibitors and changes in plasma zinc concentration has also been suggested, but again the evidence for this relationship is equivocal. One problem facing research in this area has been the lack of reliable assessment techniques for the quantitative evaluation of smell and taste function. Three quantitative methods for evaluating taste and smell function are described, together with the results of a pilot study aimed at evaluating the potential ease of application of these techniques in a larger group of patients. In this double-blind, crossover pilot study, 8-week treatment with lisinopril (20-40 mg once daily) was compared with captopril (25-50 mg twice daily) in 12 hypertensive patients. The two drugs produced similar falls in lying and standing blood pressure and neither drug produced a significant alteration in smell recognition, or olfactory or taste threshold. None of the minor changes observed appeared to correlate with either plasma zinc concentrations or intra-erythrocyte zinc levels. This study provides important observations on the use of these new techniques. Based on the wide variability of results obtained, the design of further clinical studies must address and overcome the many factors (age, sex, smoking, etc.) which may confound the study of drug effects on taste and smell.", 
    "271": "In 78 patients we studied retrospectively the occurrence of occlusion in unilateral renal artery stenosis during antihypertensive drug treatment. Complete occlusion occurred in 14 patients (18%). In a multivariate analysis the following characteristics were included: blood pressure, aetiology of the stenosis, serum creatinine, the degree of the stenosis, anti-hypertensive medication, standing renal vein renin ratio and age. In this analysis the combination of a diuretic and an ACE-inhibitor, during the observation period, showed an independent relation to the development of an occlusion (P less than 0.05). Also the ACE-inhibitor alone showed a relation (P = 0.06). In the 14 patients who developed an occlusion only three showed a significant rise in serum creatinine. We conclude that special attention should be given to the follow-up of patients with renal artery stenosis who have ACE-inhibitors in their treatment regimen, especially when in combination with a diuretic.", 
    "272": "The pharmacokinetics of 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg of cilazaprilat administered intravenously were determined in a group of eight volunteers. The fall in plasma concentration was polyphasic. Elimination was predominantly by renal excretion of the unchanged drug. The mean renal clearance values following 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg doses were 5.3 +/- 0.5, 8.1 +/- 0.5, and 9.8 +/- 0.5 l h-1 and plasma clearances were 7.8 +/- 0.5, 10.4 +/- 0.5 and 11.8 +/- 0.6 l h-1, respectively. Thus, plasma and renal clearances were dose dependent. ACE inhibition was greater than 82% for the first 4 h and about 55% at 24 h, after all three doses. There were no significant haemodynamic effects at any dose.", 
    "273": "In chronic hypertension, the lower limit of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is shifted towards high blood pressure with a consequent impairment of the tolerance to acute hypotension. Despite this, antihypertensive treatment in the great majority of patients prevents stroke and the risk for treatment-induced cerebral ischemia is only real in a limited number of clinical settings such as malignant hypertension, hypertension in the elderly, and hypertension associated with acute stroke. During long-term treatment adaptive hypertensive changes in CBF autoregulation may be reversible, especially in young patients. Drugs used for emergency lowering of blood pressure may be classified into four groups according to their effect on CBF and intracranial pressure: (1) drugs with no pharmacological action in the cerebral circulation; (2) cerebral vasodilators; (3) alpha-adrenergic and ganglionic blockers; and (4) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Oxygen saturation in the jugular venous blood is of the order of 60% to 70% and is considerably higher than in the coronary sinus. It is hypothesized that this oxygen reserve enables the brain better than the heart to take hemodynamic advantage of pressure lowering without risking tissue ischemia. This may explain why antihypertensive treatment prevents stroke but not myocardial infarction. Acute hypertensive encephalopathy is probably caused by failure of autoregulatory vasoconstriction with focal or generalized dilatation of small arteries and arterioles. This is associated with a high CBF, dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, and the formation of brain edema that is thought to cause the clinical symptoms.", 
    "274": "Long-term effects of a novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, CS-622, on Ca2+-dependent tone in aortic smooth muscles of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were examined. CS-622 (3 or 10 mg/kg/day), when orally administered to SHR for 21 weeks, exhibited a dose-dependent antihypertensive action. In Krebs-Henseleit solution, removal of Ca2+ caused much greater relaxation in aortas excised from control SHR than those from SHR treated with CS-622. Restoration of Ca2+ from zero to 2.5 mM elicited a marked contraction in aortas from control SHR but only a small contraction in aortas from both CS-622-treated SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. These findings suggested that myogenic tone that resulted from increased Ca2+ permeability in aortas of SHR was suppressed by long-term treatment with CS-622. The aortic tone from the individual rats correlated well with systolic blood pressure in both CS-622-treated and control SHR. The exaggerated myogenic tone in aortas of SHR was attenuated in the medium containing nicardipine but was not altered in the presence of CS-622 diacid (active form of CS-622) at a concentration high enough to fully inhibit aortic ACE. The myogenic tone in normal Ca2+ concentration was not decreased in aortas excised from SHR treated with hydralazine (5 mg/kg/day) for 21 weeks. We conclude that after prolonged administration CS-622 reduced the high vascular tension resulting from increased Ca2+ permeability of vascular smooth muscle membrane in SHR and that the restoration of normal Ca2+ permeability of vascular smooth muscles may underlie long-term antihypertensive action of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "275": "The use of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) has been advocated to analyze the action of therapy on cardiac index (CI). To evaluate the relationship between CI and SvO2, ten CHF patients (mean age 65 years) were studied before and one, two, three, four (T4), six, eight and 24 hours after oral administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (perindopril, 4 mg). At T4, a 12 percent increase in CI (p less than 0.01) was associated with a 16 percent decrease in arteriovenous oxygen difference (p less than 0.01), a 13 percent increase in mixed venous oxygen pressure (PvO2) (p less than 0.01), and a 9 percent increase in SvO2 (p less than 0.05) with no significant change in arterial oxygen pressure. There was no correlation between CI and SvO2 (r = 0.22) and between CI and PvO2 (r = 0.23). Individual analyses were performed and patients were divided into two groups based on CI versus SvO2 r value; group 1, n = 6, r greater than 0.65 (0.65-0.90), group 2, n = 4, r less than 0.65 (0.14-0.20). The lack of correlation in group 2 was due to a drug-dependent increase in oxygen consumption (VO2) +18 percent vs -3 percent in group 1 (p less than 0.05) associated with a lack of increase in PvO2 +3 percent vs +14 percent in group 1 (p less than 0.05) despite a similar increase in oxygen availability +19 percent versus +16 percent. It was concluded that (1) a correlation between CI and SvO2 is not found in every patient with CHF; (2) the lack of correlation in four out of our ten patients was due to an associated and significant increase in CI and VO2 in group 2; (3) group 2 patients probably had an important oxygen debt before treatment; (4) SvO2 cannot be used instead of CI to determine the hemodynamic consequences of the use of cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "276": "Forty patients with hypertensive crises, whose pressure levels had not satisfactorily decreased after intravenous furosemide 20 mg, were selected in the Emergency Ward. These patients were divided in two groups. The ones in group A received sublingual nifedipine 10 mg and the others in group B received oral captopril 50 mg. These drugs were repeated after 30 minutes to the maximum of three doses or until obtaining diastolic blood pressure less than 115 mmHg. Most patients (77.5%) had their blood pressure reduced to the proposed values after the first dose, and the remaining ones (22.5%) reacted to the therapy only after the administration of the subsequent doses. No side effects were observed. All patients were discharged from the emergency unit and were sent for follow-up in the outpatient service. The use of nifedipine and captopril has proved to be an effective treatment for hypertensive crises.", 
    "277": "The phrase 'heart failure' is used as a shorthand by medical practitioners to describe a wide variety of medical conditions ranging from acute heart failure with pulmonary oedema to terminal chronic heart failure. The medical treatment of these entities varies widely and is dependent on an understanding of the haemodynamics, pathophysiology and aetiology of the conditions, and on the pharmacology of the drugs selected. Important distinctions should be made between systolic and diastolic, acute and chronic, and extracellular and cellular heart failure. Drugs often used for treatment include diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nitrates and digoxin. Pure positive inotropic drugs are of value in the treatment of circulatory collapse, post-operatively and in terminal heart failure. Drugs with a mild positive inotropic effect which also possess other properties such as systemic vasodilation, renal vasodilation and alteration of diastolic function may be of wider value in the treatment of mild to moderate chronic heart failure but that prediction awaits proof from controlled clinical trials.", 
    "278": "In a group of 10 patients (9 male, 1 female, aged 16 to 56, mean 43 years) with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), due to ischemic heart disease (8 cases) or dilatative cardiomyopathy (2 cases), the acute hemodynamic response to captopril (CPT) (90 min after 50 mg po) was evaluated. CPT was then given starting with 15 mg q 8 hr, gradually increased within 2 or 3 days to 50 or 75 mg q 8 hr. A hemodynamic re-evaluation was performed after 20 days, and, in 5 patients, after 1 year of CPT treatment. The clinical follow-up done every 3 months in the outpatient clinic. CPT acutely produced a decrease in mean pulmonary wedge pressure: 23.8 +/- 8.9 to 18.6 +/- 8.6 mmHg, p less than 0.01, and an increase in cardiac index: 2.43 +/- 0.73 to 2.91 +/- 0.85 l/min/m2, p less than 0.01; systemic and pulmonary resistances decreased significantly, with no significant changes in heart rate and in mean brachial artery pressure. This favourable hemodynamic response persisted after 20 days of CPT treatment. In the group of 5 patients, who underwent a third hemodynamic evaluation, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated in respect to the previous control values. All patients on chronic CPT treatment experienced a gradual clinical improvement, reaching a steady state after 2 to 3 weeks; the surviving patients remained stable in the improved functional class for at least 6 months. The mortality rate was 30% in the first year, increasing to 50% in the second and to 60% in the third year of treatment. After a mean follow-up 35.7 months (range 33 to 39) the 4 surviving patients remained in the same functional class as after the first year for therapy. In our CHF patients CPT improved the quality of life, with the best clinical and hemodynamic results the first few months of treatment; life expectancy probably was not affected.", 
    "279": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the hemodynamic response to the intravenous administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor captopril. Plasmatic renin activity was also monitored. The study population included 10 patients with chronic congestive heart failure: 3 were in the second NYHA functional class, 5 in the third, and 2 in the fourth. The patients received a first dose of 5 mg of captopril followed, after 10 min, by a second bolus-dose of 15 mg. Hemodynamic and hormonal measurements were repeated in the following 4 hours. The greatest hemodynamic effect, considered as the time of maximal mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistances decrease, and cardiac index increase, was noted 20 min after the first bolus dose administration. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 13% (p less than 0.01), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) by 14% (p less than 0.05), right atrial pressure (RAP) by 30% (NS), wedge pressure (WPP) by 23% (p less than 0.01), systemic vascular resistances (SVR) by 21% (p less than 0.05), pulmonary vascular resistances by 22% (NS); cardiac index (CI) increased by 12% (p less than 0.05), stroke volume index by 10% (NS). Heart rate didn't change. The plasmatic renin activity (PRA) increased by 339% (p less than 0.01) reaching the maximal level in concomitance with the greatest hemodynamic effect. Hemodynamic changes were already noted 5 min after the first dose and lasted up to 75 min later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "280": "Ventricular arrhythmias (VA) are a major cause of sudden death. Life-threatening VA may be present in a variety of both acute and chronic conditions in which cardiac function is compromised: during acute myocardial infarction and subsequent reperfusion; some weeks after acute myocardial infarction, due to residual damage (scar formation with zones of heterogeneity); and as a consequence of congestive heart failure (CHF) resulting from myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension or other causes. Symptomatic suppression of potentially life-threatening VA is unlikely to decrease mortality, since classical antiarrhythmic drugs have failed, so far, to improve life expectancy. Drugs that influence the underlying causes of CHF seem to have a better chance of reducing mortality. There is evidence that ACE inhibitors may exert beneficial effects on arrhythmogenicity by several mechanisms in these situations. Under acute ischaemic conditions both cellular damage and undue increases in circulating catecholamines and angiotensin II may be prevented. This has been demonstrated in various animal models and confirmatory clinical evidence is emerging. Two week after experimental myocardial infarction, the pig heart is less vulnerable to programmed electrical stimulation when ACE inhibitors are administered. Finally, in CHF a variety of proarrhythmic factors, such as left ventricular dysfunction, raised catecholamine levels and, in particular, decreased potassium concentrations, are influenced beneficially by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "281": "The actions of ACE inhibitors at the tissue level (brain, heart, blood vessels) and their interference with the automatic nervous system through central and peripheral actions may, under certain conditions, be more important than inhibition of the hormonal circulating plasma angiotensin (ANG) II. Recent clinical and experimental studies and new insights into the molecular biology of the renin-angiotensin system support this view, in particular gene expression of renin and angiotensin in tissues of the cardiovascular system. These findings have implications not only for understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ACE inhibitors, but also for their therapeutic use.", 
    "282": "Traditional sphygmomanometric measurements may inaccurately reflect the actual blood pressure level over a 24-h period. This is due to several factors which are known to affect cuff blood pressure readings, including the limited number of readings obtainable throughout the 24 h and the alerting reaction and pressor response induced in patients by the presence of the physician. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has been reported to be superior to isolated cuff blood pressure readings in the diagnostic evaluation of hypertension and in assessing the blood pressure response to treatment. It does not trigger any emotionally induced pressor reaction and is able to provide a dynamic evaluation of blood pressure profiles over 24 h. The latter feature is particularly important in assessing the ability of once-daily antihypertensive treatment to reduce and maintain blood pressure at an appropriate level throughout the 24-h period. Studies to date using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring techniques suggest that once-daily administration of certain ACE inhibitors is capable of providing this long-term control of blood pressure. The 24-h antihypertensive action exerted by once-daily administration of ACE inhibitors is characterized by balanced blood pressure control throughout the day and night, and treatment does not appear to alter the neural mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular homeostasis, as suggested by the fact that these drugs have been shown not to affect 24-h blood pressure and heart rate variability. Furthermore, during administration of ACE inhibitors the sensitivity of arterial baroreceptor control of circulation is unaltered or even enhanced. These observations emphasise the potential importance of long-acting ACE inhibitors in the control of arterial hypertension.", 
    "283": "Cough is reported by between 0.7% and 14% of patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. There are more reports from women and non-smokers. The development of cough during ACE inhibitor therapy is associated with a reversible increase in the response of the cough reflex. The response remains normal in those who do not develop cough while on ACE inhibitor therapy. Both hypersensitivity of the cough reflex and the symptom of cough are reversed by sulindac which suggests that the abnormal reflex is dependent on cyclo-oxygenase products.", 
    "284": "Drug interactions common to all angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors include those with thiazide diuretics and other antihypertensive agents. Interactions involving specific ACE inhibitors include captopril-digoxin, resulting in decreased clearance of digoxin from plasma in patients with heart failure, and captopril-probenecid, causing a decrease in captopril clearance. Tissue kinins, such as bradykinin, are metabolised by ACE inhibitors. Interactions involving bradykinin include captopril-indomethacin, in which an attenuation of the antihypertensive effects of captopril is manifest. Interestingly, neither enalapril nor lisinopril appear to show this interaction with indomethacin. Kinin-based interactions may also be important in the genesis of ACE inhibitor-induced cough and skin rash. Renal dysfunction affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of all ACE inhibitors, necessitating dosage reduction. Hepatic impairment is of less clinical importance, causing a delay in the onset of action of enalapril with initial doses, but probably having little relevance to long-term therapy.", 
    "285": "Drugs within the ACE inhibitor class may be differentiated by criteria related to chemical structure, potency, metabolism, and pharmacokinetics. Duration of action, the relationship between chemical structure and clinical activity, and the need for bioactivation currently represent the most clinically relevant differences amongst the ACE inhibitor class.", 
    "286": "Renal failure is progressive irrespective of the underlying primary renal disease or continued disease activity. Intrarenal haemodynamic changes may contribute to progressive loss of renal function, and may be modified by pharmacological therapies. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have a specific therapeutic advantage in the treatment of hypertension associated with progressive renal disease. We have studied the effects of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker on systemic BP, glomerular filtration, proteinuria and histological injury in animal models of progressive renal disease (the remnant kidney and diabetes). Systemic BP was lowered similarly by each treatment in both models. Beneficial effects on renal structure, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration only occurred in the ACE inhibitor-treated animals. Intrarenal haemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors may therefore offer an advantage over other antihypertensive agents in progressive renal disease. Where there is reduced renal perfusion, intrarenal haemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors may lead to compromised renal function. Acute renal failure is a common consequence of ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, or renal artery stenosis to a single functioning kidney. Acute studies have suggested that these effects are reversible; function returns following withdrawal of ACE inhibitor therapy. We examined the long-term effects of ACE inhibitor therapy in rats with the two-kidney, one-clip (Goldblatt) model of hypertension. Rats were treated for 12 months with an ACE inhibitor or a vasodilator. After 1 year of treatment the clipped kidney from the ACE inhibitor-treated rats was small, fibrotic, and had no glomerular filtration. No functional improvement of the clipped kidney occurred following ACE inhibitor withdrawal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "287": "A number of theoretical and practical aspects of acute myocardial infarction suggest a potential role for ACE inhibition in enhancing coronary blood flow and limitation of infarct size. Indeed, the use of ACE inhibitors in acute myocardial infarction could be viewed as a logical intervention in the face of the neuroendocrine response which accompanies the acute phase. During the first 24 h post-infarction, very high plasma concentrations of arginine-vasopressin and catecholamines occur. This is followed by a sharp rise in the concentration of angiotensin II (ANG II) over the next few days. The neuroendocrine response is most marked in those patients with larger infarcts, who frequently develop left ventricular failure. The extent to which these factors influence coronary flow in acute myocardial infarction is unknown, although in chronic heart failure ACE inhibition does not reduce coronary blood flow despite a reduction in rate-pressure product, suggesting a coronary vasodilator effect. However, in the presence of fixed coronary stenoses, the fall in blood pressure and, therefore, of coronary perfusion pressure must be taken into account. Whether or not the use of ACE inhibitors can limit infarct size in man also remains to be determined, although it has been clearly demonstrated that concentrations of ANG II similar to those observed in the early phase of myocardial infarction can cause myocardial cell damage in experimental animals. Post-infarction ventricular enlargement can be reduced by ACE inhibitors. Additionally, ACE inhibitors, through their balanced vasodilator effect, maintain cardiac output whilst reducing filling pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "288": "Thirty patients with moderate to severe, uncontrolled hypertension were treated with a captopril/frusemide combination. The initial dose of captopril (6.25 mg or 12.5 mg) produced an acute fall in BP from 162 +/- 6/102 +/- 3 to 132 +/- 6/85 +/- 3 mmHg but at a dose of 12.5 mg three times daily outpatient BPs were not controlled. Frusemide (40 mg/day) was added and increased as necessary at two week intervals until BP was satisfactorily controlled or a total daily dose of 160 mg was reached. During long-term follow-up over a mean period of two years good BPs were achieved with an average daily dose of frusemide of 95 mg and captopril 52 mg (148 +/- 3/90 +/- 2 mmHg). There was no overall change in renal function or plasma potassium although small rises in blood urea were seen in some patients. In a group of 28 patients controlled on this regimen a change to a twice daily schedule without alteration of the dose of captopril or frusemide did not affect clinic BPs. In addition, BP remained controlled throughout the day as measured at home with an electronic sphygmomanometer. No case of glucose interolence was observed despite high doses of frusemide (HbA1 = 7.1 +/- 0.12%) and in 12 patients, where prospective measurements of HbA1 were measured, there was a fall from 7.6 +/- 0.21% to 6.9 +/- 0.16% suggesting an effect of captopril on insulin sensitivity. We conclude that low dose captopril with a variable frusemide dosage represents a simple and effective treatment for moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "289": "The effects of 28 days' treatment with captopril or with placebo on renal and pulmonary function were evaluated in nine patients with stable pulmonary heart disease. Captopril (25 mg twice daily) caused a 17% rise in effective renal plasma flow but no change in glomerular filtration rate, resulting in a fall in filtration fraction likely to favour natriuresis. Captopril did not alter FEV1, lung volumes, or arterial oxygen or carbon dioxide tension.", 
    "290": "Antihypertensive drugs have disparate effects on renal haemodynamics, tubular function, plasma electrolytes, and hormonal responses. Calcium entry blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are unique in that they may increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow in patients with hypertension. Both classes of drugs are distinctive in that they prevent salt retention because of their inhibitory effect on tubular sodium reabsorption. In addition to these attributes, which are desirable in terms of lowering systemic blood pressure, these 2 classes of drugs exert important intrarenal effects which may participate in limiting the progression of renal disease. ACE inhibitors have been shown to protect against the development of glomerulosclerosis in various experimental models of renal insufficiency. Importantly, there is emerging evidence from human studies supporting a distinctive beneficial effect of these agents on renal function in patients with hypertension, mild chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus. Calcium entry blockers have also been shown to exert some beneficial effect in limiting the progression of experimental kidney disease but neither an improvement in glomerular sclerosis nor a decrease in proteinuria have been clearly documented. At present ACE inhibitors appear the most attractive agents in terms of arresting the progression of renal disease. Acute deterioration in renal function may occur following the administration of ACE inhibitors, calcium entry blockers, and beta-blockers. This complication should be considered in every patient on antihypertensive therapy who suffers an unexplained deterioration in renal function. In particular, the sudden deterioration in renal function following initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor is a clue to the possible presence of bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of a solitary functioning kidney. Renal damage may also occur in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis even though total (2-kidney) GFR may not be appreciably reduced. In this setting, a captopril renal scan with hippuran and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) provides physiological information regarding the renal blood flow and GFR of each kidney. In patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis the impact of ACE inhibitor therapy on GFR may be discerned by the use of the DTPA scan, which may demonstrate a reduction in GFR in the stenotic kidney that is not apparent by evaluation of total kidney GFR. This suggests that despite adequate control of systemic blood pressure and unchanged plasma creatinine progressive kidney damage in the stenotic kidney ensues.", 
    "291": "The anti-hypertensive effectiveness and effect on the \"quality of life\" of captopril administered for 90 days to 17 patients suffering from mild-to-moderate arterial hypertension and already under anti-hypertensive treatment have been assessed. At the end of treatment with captopril, 76% of the patients attained normal pressure values. A diuretic was added in 7 patients. Average A.P. fell from 183 +/- 24/110 +/- 9 mmHg to 147 +/- 11/92 +/- 5 mmHg (p less than 0.001) without significant changes in heart rate. \"Quality of life\" was assessed on the basis of a questionnaire at the start and finish of treatment and it was reported improved after treatment with captopril compared to the previous pharmacological treatment. This improvement was particularly felt with respect to sense of wellbeing and capacity to perform working and recreation activity, and there was a reduction in physical disturbances.", 
    "292": "We describe the first case of de novo asthma following treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. Despite drug withdrawal there was evidence of persistent airways obstruction and bronchial hyperreactivity. This suggests the possibility that ACE inhibitors may uncover an asthmatic tendency in patients with pre-existing bronchial hyperreactivity.", 
    "293": "Although hypertension has been defined numerically as blood pressure levels above 140/90 mmHg, there is no doubt that a blood pressure level within the \"normal\" range increases the stress on a diseased heart. For this reason, vasodilator therapy is often successful in treating congestive heart failure. The authors propose the term relative hypertension to illustrate the latter situation.", 
    "294": "Angiotensin II has long been recognized as a key factor in cardiovascular regulation. The effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in controlling essential hypertension suggests that angiotensin II plays a key role in its pathology. The tools of molecular biology have provided the means for a critical reassessment of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in physiology and pathology. The analysis has shown that angiotensin peptides are also synthesized and processed locally in a variety of tissues, including the vascular wall, adrenal glands, heart, and brain. Since angiotensin II is a potent modulator of cardiovascular control centers in the brain, the hypothesis is now advanced that a defect in the brain renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system contributes to the development of hypertensive disease.", 
    "295": "An undetermined percentage of the 60 million hypertensive Americans have potentially correctable renovascular hypertension (RVHT). Conventional plasma renin activity (PRA) determinations and radionuclide renography have limited sensitivity and specificity as screening tests for RVHT. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril stimulates renin secretion and causes transient decreases in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow within the stenotic kidney. Review of recent studies in hypertensive patients suggests that captopril stimulation of both PRA determinations and conventional renography may enhance the sensitivity and specificity of these studies in detecting RVHT.", 
    "296": "Hypertension is a common problem encountered after renal transplantation. Many different mechanisms may be responsible for hypertension in this setting, and therapy will depend upon the mechanism(s) affecting the individual patient. Factors that may cause or aggravate post-transplantation hypertension include renal dysfunction secondary to rejection or other diseases of the transplanted kidney, renin production from the diseased native kidneys if these kidneys have not been surgically removed, extracellular fluid volume expansion, toxic effects of medications used after transplantation, especially cyclosporine and intravenous prednisolone, or primary hypertension in the donor or recipient. Renal artery stenosis may predispose to acute renal failure in the presence of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Severe renal artery stenosis may also lead to refractory salt and water retention and fluid overload with congestive heart failure and hypertension, mediated primarily due to extracellular fluid volume excess. Therapy with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty or, as a last resort, surgery, can be successful in controlling these problems.", 
    "297": "The direct effects of a renin inhibitor, N-acetyl-pepstatin and five angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and the active diacid forms of enalapril, ramipril, cilazapril, and CS-622, on the vascular renin-angiotensin system were examined in isolated perfused rat mesenteric arteries. Vascular renin activity and angiotensin II (Ang II) released into the perfusate were determined. Infusion of N-acetyl-pepstatin (5 X 10(-8)-5 X 10(-6) M) suppressed vascular renin activity and Ang II release dose dependently. Isoproterenol (10(-6) M) induced a 135 +/- 30% increase in Ang II release from the basal value. N-Acetyl-pepstatin (5 X 10(-6) M) suppressed isoproterenol-induced Ang II release. Infusions of 5 X 10(-6) M captopril and the diacid forms of enalapril, ramipril, cilazapril, and CS-622 by themselves had little effect on Ang II release, but concomitant infusion of isoproterenol with these angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors significantly decreased Ang II release (71 +/- 21%, 51 +/- 40%, 8 +/- 21%, 69 +/- 24%, and 44 +/- 29% increase, respectively, from the basal values). These results indicate that N-acetyl-pepstatin suppresses the vascular renin-angiotensin system. This effect may in part contribute to the hypotensive actions of renin inhibitors. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors also suppress locally generated Ang II, the mechanism and physiological significance still remain to be clarified.", 
    "298": "The effects of combined renin inhibition and converting enzyme inhibition on mean arterial pressure and the plasma renin-angiotensin system were studied in conscious rats. In sodium-replete rats the infusion of the renin inhibitor CP71362 (100 micrograms/kg/min) decreased blood pressure by 13 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), reduced plasma renin activity to undetectable levels, but did not lower plasma angiotensin II. In rats treated chronically with enalapril (30 mg/kg/day), CP71362 decreased blood pressure by an additional 5 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.025) and reduced plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentrations to undetectable levels. The effects of renin inhibition were also tested under conditions where the renin-angiotensin system was stimulated. In rats on a low sodium diet, CP71362 decreased blood pressure by 15 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), a decrease similar to that in rats on a normal diet. Plasma renin activity was decreased below detectable limits, but plasma angiotensin II concentrations were not reduced. In rats on a low sodium diet treated chronically with enalapril, CP71362 did not further decrease blood pressure although angiotensin II levels were significantly reduced. An additive effect of combined converting enzyme and renin inhibition on blood pressure lowering and inhibition of plasma angiotensin II was found in rats anesthetized with Inactin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "299": "The glomeruli of kidneys subjected to reduced perfusion pressure were examined morphometrically. The left renal artery was narrowed for 30 min in anesthetized dogs with (n = 6) or without (n = 7) converting-enzyme inhibition (captopril). The kidneys were then rapidly fixed by glutaraldehyde perfusion at high flow rate. In a comparison of glomeruli of kidneys subjected to pressure reduction in captopril-treated and untreated dogs, there was significantly greater mesangial contraction in the latter, but morphometric analysis revealed no significant differences in the glomerular surface area available for filtration as evidenced by glomerular capillary volume fractions, surface areas of the filtering basement membrane between epithelial and endothelial cells, or the length densities of the glomerular epithelial slits. In a comparison of the left (pressure reduction) and right (no pressure reduction) kidneys in the captopril-treated dogs, there was no significant effect of reduction of renal perfusion pressure per se on mesangial contraction or glomerular filtration surface area when angiotensin (ANG) II formation was blocked. Thus ANG II caused mesangial cell contraction after renal artery stenosis, but this did not significantly change glomerular ultrafiltration surface area.", 
    "300": "Concanavalin A (con A) chromatography of rat plasma revealed the presence of three differently glycosylated forms of renin, including the con A unbound form (renin C), the loosely bound form (renin A), and the tightly bound form (renin B). Rat renal cortical slices in vitro secreted all these forms. They had a different half-life in the plasma after ligation of both renal artery and vein (half-life of 21 +/- 1, 14 +/- 3, and 35 +/- 4 min for renin A, B, and C, respectively). Thus differently glycosylated forms of renin are released from the kidney into the blood circulation and disappear, with a different half-life. Rats were sodium-depleted and captopril-treated (40-60 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 2 wk, and the effects of these treatments on relative proportions of renin A, B, and C were investigated. These treatments elevated plasma renin concentration approximately 60-fold (from 24 +/- 3 to 1,406 +/- 128 ng angiotensin I.h-1.ml-1; P less than 0.01), in association with an increase in the relative percent of renin C in the plasma from 22 +/- 2 to 39 +/- 3% (P less than 0.01). Moreover, the relative proportion of renin C released from the renal cortical slices was significantly higher in the treated than in the control rats (42 +/- 9 vs. 16 +/- 3% of secreted renin, respectively; P less than 0.02). These results show that the predominant release of renin C, with the longest half-life (35 min) in the plasma, contributes to the increased plasma renin concentration in sodium-depleted and captopril-treated rats.", 
    "301": "Experiments were designed to elucidate the effects of S-nitrosocaptopril (SnoCap) on vascular reactivity. Rings of bovine femoral and coronary arteries were mounted for isometric tension recording in physiological saline solution. SnoCap induced dose-dependent relaxations in both the coronary and femoral arteries, but inhibited contractions in the coronary artery to a significantly greater degree. Relaxations to SnoCap were inhibited by methylene blue. Angiotensin I and angiotensin II induced dose-dependent contractions in the bovine femoral artery. The angiotensin II antagonist saralasin induced comparable inhibition of the response to angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Captopril (10(-6) M) and SnoCap (10(-6) M) equally inhibited contraction to angiotensin I, inducing a 50-fold shift in the dose-response curve. SnoCap inhibited contraction to angiotensin II, inducing a 5-fold shift in the dose-response curve and depressing the maximum response. In summary, the S-nitrosylated derivative of captopril is a unique compound that inhibits vascular reactivity through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme. This combined nitrovasodilator and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may have clinical utility in hypertension, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.", 
    "302": "We have synthesized an S-nitrosylated derivative of captopril, S-nitrosocaptopril, that manifests nitrosovasodilatory activity, inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme activity and inhibits platelet aggregation. The direct vasodilatory effects of S-nitrosocaptopril reflect the effects of the thionitrite bond, the presence of which does not in any way influence S-nitrosocaptopril's ability to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme. Thionitrite stimulation of both vascular and platelet soluble guanylate cyclase activity leads to increases in intracellular cyclic GMP that are accompanied by vasodilatation and platelet inhibition, respectively. S-nitrosocaptopril is a novel hybrid molecule that has potential use in the treatment of hypertension regardless of renin status, angina pectoris and congestive heart failure.", 
    "303": "The effect of stimulation of the cervical sympathetic ganglia on the upper limit of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation was studied in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) following intravenous administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10 mg/kg). CBF was measured using the intracarotid 133Xe injection method in halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthetized WKY and SHR. Arterial blood pressure was raised stepwise by the intravenous infusion of noradrenaline. Toward the end of the study, Evans blue was injected and the brains examined for gross blood-brain barrier breakdown. In SHR, sympathetic stimulation reextended the upper limit of CBF autoregulation, which was at a mean arterial blood pressure level of 120-139 mm Hg in the control group of eight SHR and above 170 mm Hg in the stimulated group of nine SHR. In the group of nine WKY subjected to sympathetic stimulation, the upper limit of CBF autoregulation was reached at a mean arterial blood pressure level of 110-129 mm Hg as opposed to 90-109 mm Hg in a previous unstimulated group of WKY. In the two groups subjected to sympathetic stimulation, there was no extravasation of Evans blue in any of the brains. In the control group of SHR, in which there had been marked increases in CBF, three out of eight brains had foci with extravasation of the dye. It is concluded that in normotensive and in hypertensive rats sympathetic stimulation attenuates the downward shift of the upper limit of CBF autoregulation, which is known to accompany intravenous administration of captopril.", 
    "304": "In the human heart the beta-adrenergic pathways are the primary means of increasing cardiac performance in response to acute or chronic stress. Control of beta pathway function is achieved by changes in the receptors themselves, and to a lesser degree by adjustments in the inhibitory G protein (Gi). In heart failure myocardial beta-receptor function is substantially reduced, but the beta-receptor pathways are so powerful that they remain capable of supporting inotropic function. Certain therapeutic interventions that improve exercise performance in heart failure can partially restore beta-receptor pathway function to normal; these interventions include beta-blocker therapy and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Other types of therapy, such as chronic administration of beta-adrenergic agonists, may produce undesirable effects by increasing beta-receptor subsensitivity; however, the effects of beta-agonists on beta-receptor function are somewhat unpredictable and certain beta-agonists do not appear to produce much desensitization. Finally, the failing human heart is in effect partially denervated due to depletion of neuronal norepinephrine, and consequently in advanced heart failure beta-agonists that possess an indirect component of action will be less effective than exclusively direct-acting agents. These observations indicate that the baseline status and the intervention-associated behaviour of the human myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor systems need to be considered in developing therapeutic strategies in congestive heart failure.", 
    "305": "Although there is no obvious pharmacological rationale for the combined use of an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker in the treatment of hypertension, this combination has proved to be more effective than monotherapy in a number of studies, some of which are reviewed. Moreover, there is evidence that this combination may be beneficial after myocardial infarction. Combined use of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy therefore warrants further investigation.", 
    "306": "With the increasingly widespread recognition of the adverse side effects of traditional antihypertensive medications, alternative approaches to the treatment of uncomplicated hypertensive patients have been proposed. The use of vasodilator agents, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers results in blood pressure reduction without adverse metabolic consequences. Furthermore, vasodilatory agents reverse the principal physiological abnormality of hypertensive patients, that is, they reverse the increased systemic vascular resistance that characterizes these patients and, in so doing, may alleviate abnormalities of systolic and diastolic left ventricular performance. In particular, a comparison of the effects of nifedipine and propranolol on left ventricular (LV) function in patients with moderately severe hypertension revealed significant differences in their effects on cardiac function. Although both drugs reduced blood pressure to an identical degree, nifedipine therapy was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, an increase in cardiac output, and improved parameters of left ventricular contractile and diastolic function as measured by quantitative radionuclide ventriculography. Vasodilator therapy should be considered for the initial treatment of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension.", 
    "307": "The fourth report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure varies from the Committee's earlier reports in a number of ways. The introduction of additional effective antihypertensive agents with varying pharmacologic properties has undoubtedly stimulated the Joint National Committee to recommend a more flexible individualized approach to treatment. Diuretics, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are all recommended as reasonable first-step agents in treatment of hypertension. The pharmacologic properties, cost, and side-effect profiles of these drugs differ considerably, and the effectiveness of certain agents appears to vary according to the patient's age and race. All these factors should be considered, as should the existence of any concomitant disease, in choosing initial treatment. Whatever drug is chosen, the physician must continue to provide careful follow-up to ensure that adequate blood pressure control is achieved with minimal side effects.", 
    "308": "The hypotensive effect of enalapril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, given as a single agent once daily, was evaluated prospectively over a 16 week period in 20 subjects. One patient abandoned therapy and 2 were withdrawn (increased creatinine levels in one and the need for associated therapy in the other). Side effects developed in 3 patients: creatinine elevation, skin rush and a \"salty taste\", respectively. A significant decrease in blood pressure (p less than 0.01) attaining normal levels in 6 out of 17 patients was observed. Normal blood pressure levels were not reached in severe hypertension; the association of hydrochlorothyazide was effective in 5 of 11 such subjects. Thus, enalapril may be safely used as a first stage single therapy in mild or moderate hypertension.", 
    "309": "In order to evaluate the action of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (Captopril) on the pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, twenty one mongrel dogs were studied in two groups: group I with hypoxia, group II with normoxia. The dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and had their femoral vein and artery cannulated for blood-gas sampling and pressure records. They were mechanically ventilated with hypoxic gas mixtures (12.3% O2-87.7% N2)--group I and room air group II, at random. In both groups we measured, before and after administration of captopril 3 mg/kg intravenously, gas exchange and hemodynamic variables, as well as plasmatic levels of renin and angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE). Our results showed that the group I dogs decreased the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances with small changes in pulmonary arterial pressures and no significant variations of pulmonary systemic resistances ratio. There were no significant variations of the same variables in the group II dogs. The gas exchange has not changed in either group of animals. In the group I dogs Captopril provoked systemic and pulmonary vasodilatation, with no gasometric and ventilation/perfusion ratio changes. In our experimental model we could not conclude that Captopril inhibited the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and/or that the angiotensin II had some action on the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction mechanism, but there are some evidences favoring that hypothesis.", 
    "310": "We tested the effects of late pregnancy on the depressor response to bradykinin (100, 200 and 400ng) in rats. All experiments were performed under anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Catheters were connected to the arterial and venous lines for blood pressure recording and administration of drugs. Late pregnancy (19- to 21-day) showed a hypersensitivity of the depressor response to bradykinin. The effects of captopril, Kininase II inhibitor, on the depressor response to bradykinin were examined in rats. Since captopril (50, 100 and 200 micrograms) notably increased the depressor response to bradykinin both in nonpregnant and 19- to 21-day pregnant rats, kininase II acts as a bradykinin metabolizing enzyme in vivo. Captopril (50, 100, 200 micrograms), however, resulted in the augmented parallel increases of depressor response to bradykinin (100ng) in both nonpregnant and pregnant rats. Our data may suggest that kininase II is not involved in the hypersensitivity to bradykinin in late pregnancy in rats.", 
    "311": "In a series of studies, lisinopril, a new, once-daily, non-sulphydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, has been evaluated for the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). Lisinopril significantly improved exercise duration, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the clinical signs and symptoms of CHF when compared with placebo in a 12-week prospective, randomised, double-blind trial involving 130 patients (NYHA Class II-IV) who were also receiving digitalis and diuretics. In another study involving 10 patients with CHF, lisinopril was found to increase maximal oxygen uptake. Lisinopril has also been compared with captopril in a 12-week randomised, double-blind, parallel trial in 189 patients with CHF (Class II-IV) on digoxin and diuretics. Both lisinopril and captopril increased treadmill exercise times. However, lisinopril was equally effective in patients with renal impairment whereas captopril was not. Also, lisinopril, but not captopril, improved LVEF. In all studies, lisinopril was well tolerated in a manner similar to captopril. Lisinopril produces more frequent increases in serum creatinine than captopril, but these changes are rarely of significant consequence. These results confirm those of previous studies, from which it is concluded that lisinopril is an important addition to the ACE inhibitor class for the treatment of CHF.", 
    "312": "The two major causes of death in congestive heart failure (CHF) are progressive heart failure (approximately 60% of cases) and sudden death (30%). Sudden death in CHF is caused primarily by malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The underlying mechanism has yet to be established, but myocardial metabolic factors are probably involved. Although there is a clear association between complex ventricular arrhythmias and left ventricular function, it has not been shown convincingly that antiarrhythmic agents can reduce sudden death in CHF. Progressive deterioration of myocardial function is associated with altered myocardial energy production. Notably, the physiological effects of neuroendocrine activation in chronic CHF may be deleterious to myocardial function. The CONSENSUS study was carried out to evaluate the association between neuroendocrine activation and deterioration of myocardial function using ACE inhibitors. A marked reduction in mortality rate occurred in the enalapril-treated group, where the one-year mortality was reduced by 31%. The reduction in mortality was solely among patients with progressive CHF (a reduction of 50%); there was no difference in the incidence of sudden death. Analysis of blood samples drawn at baseline in the placebo group showed a significant positive correlation between mortality and plasma angiotensin II (P less than 0.05), aldosterone (P = 0.003), noradrenaline (P less than 0.001), adrenal levels (P less than 0.001), and atrial natriuretic peptide (P = 0.003). This was not observed in enalapril-treated patients. The significant reduction in mortality in the enalapril group was found consistently among patients with baseline hormone levels above the median value. In CHF, the underlying disease may induce serious arrhythmias and/or progressive failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "313": "To investigate the effects of local application of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on the mechanical properties of the arterial wall, the volume/pressure relationship (from 25 to 175 mmHg) in the in vivo isolated carotid artery was measured in normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The compliance of the carotid artery (CC) was calculated, for each level of pressure, as the slope of the the volume/pressure curve. The carotid artery was less compliant in the SHR strain than in normotensive rats. This rigidity was partly related to an increased tone of the arterial smooth muscle in SHR compared with the WKY. Local incubation with lisinopril (2.3 micrograms/ml) produced a significant increase in the compliance of the carotid artery in both normotensive and hypertensive rats; CC was increased by 23% in WKY rats and by 14% in SHR. Since the goal of antihypertensive treatment may be not only to reduce blood pressure (BP) but also to improve the mechanical properties of the arterial system, the direct effect of lisinopril on the arterial wall may have a major beneficial role.", 
    "314": "Sixteen patients with mild to moderate hypertension were studied in a double-blind crossover comparison of single oral doses of lisinopril 10 mg and enalapril 10 mg. Both drugs caused a marked fall in blood pressure (BP) with a clinically useful effect persisting for 24 h postdose and with no significant difference between treatments in this respect. The time to minimum systolic BP was 2 h (95% confidence limits 0-19 h) longer for lisinopril. The fall in ACE activity at 24 h was 18.5 (8.2-28.8) U/l greater for lisinopril. We conclude that, within the limits of this small study, lisinopril appears to be as effective as enalapril in lowering BP and that it may have a slower onset of action that could be clinically valuable.", 
    "315": "The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril 20 mg once daily and slow-release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily were compared in a double-blind, parallel group, 10-week study involving 274 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. During the first 6 weeks of treatment, slow-release nifedipine and lisinopril produced similar reductions in lying and standing blood pressure (BP), except for lying systolic BP (SBP) which was reduced to a greater extent by lisinopril. After 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily was added if BP remained uncontrolled (lying DBP greater than or equal to 95 mmHg); a significantly greater proportion of patients in the nifedipine group than in the lisinopril group required additional diuretic treatment (29% versus 14%, respectively; P = 0.005). Moreover, after a further 4 weeks of treatment BP was adequately controlled (lying DBP less than 95 mmHg) in significantly more lisinopril-treated patients than in the nifedipine group (91.4% versus 78.3%, respectively; P = 0.006). Lisinopril was better tolerated than slow-release nifedipine. The frequency of drug-related events was significantly lower (threefold) for lisinopril than for nifedipine (P = 0.001) and the number of withdrawals from treatment with nifedipine was more than three times that in the lisinopril treatment group (P = 0.009). Lisinopril appears to provide an effective once-daily antihypertensive treatment which is at least as effective as, and better tolerated than, slow-release nifedipine.", 
    "316": "A double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study was carried out to compare the effects of once-daily treatment with lisinopril 20 mg and captopril 50 mg in 304 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with a lying DBP between 95 and 115 mmHg were randomised to either active treatment for 10 weeks. BP measurements were made approximately 24 h after the previous dose of either drug. After 6 weeks, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily was added for patients with a lying DBP greater than or equal to 95 mmHg and a final assessment was made in all patients after a further 4 weeks of treatment. After 6 weeks of monotherapy, lisinopril had reduced lying and standing BP by an average of 18/14 mmHg and 19/12 mmHg, respectively, compared with 15/12 mmHg and 14/11 mmHg respectively for captopril. The larger fall in SBP with lisinopril was statistically significant (lying SBP, P = 0.01; standing SBP, P = 0.0001). In addition, a significantly larger proportion of patients achieved BP control (DBP less than 95 mmHg) with lisinopril than with captopril (79% versus 67%; P = 0.02). Neither drug significantly altered heart rate. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide in some patients produced a further, small reduction in mean BP in both groups although, 10 weeks after randomisation, the proportion of patients in whom BP control had been achieved with lisinopril was still significantly greater than that achieved with captopril (90% versus 79%; P = 0.02). Both drugs were well tolerated and no serious adverse events occurred during the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "317": "The safety and tolerability of lisinopril (1.25-160 mg daily) were assessed in 3,270 patients (2,688 hypertensives and 582 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF] and 280 healthy subjects. The duration of therapy ranged from a single dose to 43 months; 438 patients received lisinopril for at least 12 months (mean 20 months). In the hypertensive population, the most frequent adverse events reported were headache, dizziness, cough, nausea, diarrhoea and fatigue, although not all of these events were thought to be related to lisinopril; 6.1% discontinued lisinopril due to adverse clinical events, most commonly cough and nausea. Twelve hypertensive patients died (0.45%), but most of these were not receiving lisinopril at the time of death and none was considered to be drug-related. In CHF patients, the most frequently reported adverse events were dizziness, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, hypotension and fatigue. Again, not all of these reports were considered to be drug-related. Therapy was withdrawn in 9.6% of patients--hypotension, dizziness, diarrhoea and rash being the most frequent reasons. Fifty-three CHF patients died (9.1%) and in three cases death was considered to be related to lisinopril therapy. Hypotension, orthostatic effects or dizziness following the initial dose of lisinopril occurred infrequently (in 1.3% of the hypertensive group, including those receiving hydrochlorothiazide, and in 4.8% of CHF patients). Changes in laboratory parameters were generally minor and seldom resulted in discontinuation of therapy. Long-term treatment of hypertension and CHF with lisinopril for at least 3 years confirms that the drug is well tolerated. Overall, the side-effect profile is very similar to that of other ACE inhibitors with regard to class-specific effects. However, taste disturbance was rarely observed.", 
    "318": "Established essential hypertension is characterised haemodynamically by a normal cardiac output and elevated total peripheral resistance. As hypertensive cardiovascular disease progresses, and the patient grows older, cardiac output falls and total peripheral resistance is further elevated. The activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system declines throughout life and reaches its lowest levels in the elderly, unless there is congestive heart failure. In long-standing hypertension, target organ disease such as left ventricular hypertrophy, nephrosclerosis and cerebrovascular damage is commonly observed. Rational antihypertensive therapy should therefore aim to lower total peripheral resistance, spare cardiac output, and maintain or improve blood flow to target organs. ACE inhibitors lower arterial pressure by decreasing total peripheral resistance, they maintain or improve cardiac contractility, promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and increase renal blood flow. Lisinopril is a novel ACE inhibitor that does not contain a sulphydryl group. It is not a prodrug and thus does not require bioactivation by the liver. Lisinopril has a long duration of action, allowing it to be used as a single daily dose in the treatment of hypertension. Preliminary studies from our laboratory indicate that lisinopril reduces cardiac output and preload to the left ventricle. Lisinopril also reduces left ventricular hypertrophy and lowers renal vascular resistance, thereby increasing renal blood flow. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, lisinopril is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and is at least as effective as atenolol or metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "319": "The safety and efficacy of once-daily lisinopril was assessed in an 8-week open-label study of 24 elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Following withdrawal of all previous antihypertensive treatment, including diuretics, lisinopril treatment was started at a dose of 5 mg, increasing to a maximum of 40 mg once daily as required. Treatment provided effective 24-h BP control in all patients, most of whom required a daily dose of 20-40 mg, and cardiothoracic index decreased significantly, indicating a favourable effect on left ventricular volumes. There were no significant ECG alterations and no major side effects occurred. It is concluded that lisinopril 5 mg is a safe starting dose for elderly patients who are not on diuretics, and that once-daily lisinopril monotherapy reduces BP safety without affecting heart rate.", 
    "320": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, enalapril (a prodrug) and lisinopril (directly acting), were compared in eight patients with hepatic cirrhosis and 10 healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of both drugs were affected in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The percentage urinary recovery of the parent (inactive) drug enalapril was higher in patients with cirrhosis than controls. Serum concentrations of both drugs showed considerable variation in cirrhotic patients, but the variance ratio between patients with cirrhosis and controls was greater for enalapril than lisinopril. Peak serum concentrations of both ACE inhibitors were higher in patients with cirrhosis than in controls, which may be due to increased drug absorption. The time to peak drug concentration was longer for lisinopril than enalapril.", 
    "321": "A single-dose, single-blind, crossover study of vasodilator/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor interactions was carried out in 16 volunteers. Enalapril 20 mg and lisinopril 20 mg were administered either alone or in combination with hydralazine 25 mg. Co-administration of hydralazine significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of lisinopril (AUC0-48 h 766.8 +/- 66.3 ng.h/ml (lisinopril) vs 1022.3 +/- 115.3 ng.h/ml (lisinopril + hydralazine)). This did not occur with enalaprilat (AUC 710.1 +/- 51.2 ng.h/ml (enalapril) vs 681.9 +/- 44.9 ng.h/ml (enalapril + hydralazine); mean +/- SEM). Urinary recovery of lisinopril showed a similar trend, but group differences did not achieve statistical significance despite comparable confidence intervals. Although hydralazine had no effect on the bioavailability of enalapril, significantly increased bioavailability was observed with lisinopril. This type of drug interaction is rare. The underlying mechanism is unclear, but may relate to increased absorption of lisinopril.", 
    "322": "In an open, crossover study, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of lisinopril and enalapril, administered alone and in combination with propranolol, were evaluated in 12 volunteers. The maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of lisinopril and time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) were 64 +/- 16 ng/ml and 7.5 +/- 1.5 h, respectively. The area under the serum curve (AUC) was 916 +/- 239 h. ng/ml. The Cmax of enalaprilat (89 +/- 34 ng/ml) was greater than that of lisinopril whilst Tmax was shorter (4.3 +/- 1.7 h) and AUC smaller (718 +/- 17 h.ng/ml) (P less than 0.01). Renal clearance of drug 48 h post-dosing showed that enalaprilat (164 +/- 38 ml/min) was cleared from plasma significantly more rapidly than lisinopril (82 +/- 16 ml/min) (P less than 0.001). Mean supine blood pressure decreased significantly with all treatments, as did heart rate. No significant changes were observed in either the serum concentrations or the urinary outputs of these ACE inhibitors following combination with propranolol, apart from a greater variability of Cmax after addition of propranolol to enalapril compared with lisinopril in combination.", 
    "323": "Structurally, lisinopril differs from captopril in that it does not contain a sulphydryl group and it differs from enalapril and related compounds in that it is not an ester prodrug. Published data on the clinical pharmacology of lisinopril are reviewed and data from new studies are presented. A radioimmunoassay has been used to study the clinical pharmacokinetics of lisinopril and 14C-lisinopril has been used in metabolism studies in man. Following oral administration, lisinopril is absorbed slowly but the absorbed drug is immediately available without any requirement for biotransformation by the liver. The plasma half-life controlling accumulation during chronic administration is 12-13 h and the absorbed drug is eliminated via glomerular filtration. These properties are consistent with once-daily dosing and uncomplicated clinical use in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "324": "The effect of lisinopril 20 mg given once daily was assessed in 25 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension using both ambulatory monitoring and cuff measurements of blood pressure (BP) made in the clinic. The effect of 4 weeks of lisinopril treatment on BP was compared with the BP recorded after 2 weeks on placebo. Lisinopril treatment reduced supine and standing cuff clinic measurements of BP 24 h after dosing by (systolic/diastolic) 21.1/11.8 and 16.7/10.1 mmHg, respectively. Ambulatory measurements indicated that the antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was sustained throughout the 24 h without any significant effect on heart rate and that lisinopril did not affect the diurnal rhythm of BP changes. Side effects reported during the 4 weeks of lisinopril treatment were mild and did not necessitate discontinuation of treatment. Lisinopril appears to be an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive agent when given in a single daily dose.", 
    "325": "The present studies were designed to analyze the potential contribution of angiotensin II and thromboxane A2 to the remarkable decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow observed after unilateral release of 24-hour bilateral ureteral obstruction. Pretreatment of the animals with inhibitors of either thromboxane or angiotensin synthesis for 48 hours prior to and during obstruction eliminated the contribution of these vasoconstrictors. Inhibition of these vasoconstrictors during the period of obstruction results in a greater increase in renal plasma flow and GFR than when inhibition was accomplished after release of the obstruction. These data suggest a greater role for these vasoconstrictors in the decrease in GFR that occurs with obstruction. Simultaneous inhibition of thromboxane and angiotensin production normalized GFR of the postobstructed kidney. Administration of atrial peptide after release of obstruction in the different groups of rats resulted in further increases in GFR, urine flow and absolute sodium excretion. It is suggested that atrial peptide participates in the renal hemodynamic changes that occur in the postobstructed kidney.", 
    "326": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors potentiate the wheal response to intradermal bradykinin. Both converting enzyme inhibitors and bradykinin stimulate prostaglandin synthesis and prostaglandins enhance the cutaneous response to bradykinin. We examined the possibility that the increased wheal response to intradermal bradykinin in the presence of enalapril was due to the effect of prostaglandins. Indomethacin did not inhibit the potentiation by enalapril of the wheal response to bradykinin.", 
    "327": "The objective is here to study the long and intermediate term clinical and haemodynamic effects of enalapril during chronic heart failure resistant to the classic digitalis-diuretics treatment. The study involves 16 patients (12 males and 4 females), with a mean age of 50 years. Before being given enalapril, 12 patients were at stage IV and 4 patients at stage II of the NYHA; the mean capillary pressure was quite elevated (30 +/- 6.3 mmHg), the cardiac index has collapsed (2.12 +/- 0.38 l.min.m2) and the stroke fraction (SF) is 0.28 +/- 0.08. At the 1st month control, there is a definite functional and haemodynamic improvement of the pre-charge as well as the post-charge. This improvement is still present at 6 months. The ventricular function is improved (SF = 0.38 +/- 0.13; p less than 0.001). The clinical tolerance of enalapril is excellent and the only adverse reaction is a transient deterioration of the renal function in a patient with diabetic glomerulopathy.", 
    "328": "Physical incompatibility studies between an intravenous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, and potentially coadministrable ICU medications have been performed. Forty-one medications and four solutions were evaluated. The medications were anesthetic/narcotics, antibiotics, an anticoagulant, a bronchodilator, electrolyte solutions, fluids, H-2 receptor blocking agents, steroids and vasoactive agents. There was no turbidity, precipitation, or color change caused by the admixing of enalaprilat with any of the 45 agents studied. This study did not take bioavailability into consideration.", 
    "329": "Seventy-nine hypertensive nephrosclerosis patients entered a prospective randomized single-blind study to 1) establish the pattern of decay of renal function in this population and the variability therein and 2) to determine if strict diastolic blood pressure (DBP) control (less than or equal to 80 mm Hg) is more effective than conventional levels (90-95 mm Hg) in conserving renal function. Because of unexpected significant improvement in renal function in patients from both groups, which changed the perspectives on the course of this disease as described herein, this report is being published before completion of the trial. The selection criteria were 1) serum creatinine concentration of 1.6-7.0 mg/dl, 2) glomerular filtration rate of less than 70 ml/min/1.73 m2, and 3) absence of diseases (other than hypertension) known to destroy renal function. Renal function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate [( 125I]iothalamate clearance) and serum creatinine concentration. Before randomization, DBP was aggressively treated to reduce it to less than 80 mm Hg. Twenty-two subjects (14 in the strict DBP control group and eight in the conventional DBP control group) have been enrolled in the study for 36 months. In contrast to results from previous studies in humans and rats, renal function improved in both patient groups. Thus, irrevocable progression of renal damage after onset of renal failure from high blood pressure does not necessarily occur, and in fact, long-term improvement of renal function resulted from the effects of the study itself.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "330": "Treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor has been shown to stimulate aortic prostaglandin I2 synthesis. We studied whether converting enzyme inhibitor-stimulated prostaglandin I2 synthesis might be mediated by kinins. Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a continuous 70-minute infusion of either saline or a kinin analogue antagonist, [DArg0-Hyp3-Thi5-DPhe7-Thi8]bradykinin, 8 micrograms/kg/min. After 10 minutes, rats were given an intravenous bolus of either vehicle or the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (30 micrograms/100 g body wt). After 70 minutes, aorta and renal cortical slices were harvested and incubated in vitro in buffer without drugs at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C for 60 minutes. The buffer was then sampled for measurement of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (an index of prostaglandin I2), prostaglandin E2, and renin release (angiotensin I generation) by radioimmunoassay. The aortic prostaglandin I2 from rats treated with converting enzyme inhibitor was significantly elevated (36.7 +/- 5.0 ng/mg dry wt/hr) compared with aorta from rats treated with either vehicle (25.6 +/- 2.2 ng/mg/hr), kinin antagonist (25.1 +/- 2.4 ng/mg/hr), or kinin antagonist plus converting enzyme inhibitor (23.0 +/- 2.0 ng/mg/hr), p less than 0.02. There were no differences in aortic prostaglandin E2, renin release, or prostaglandin E2 from renal cortical slices. Direct in vitro incubation of aorta with molar concentrations of converting enzyme inhibitor from 10(-9) to 10(-4) had no effect on prostaglandin I2. These results suggest that kinins may mediate the effect of converting enzyme inhibition on aortic prostaglandin I2 synthesis and thereby may account for part of the hemodynamic responses resulting from treatment using converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "331": "We studied brain angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors by quantitative autoradiography in adult normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after treating the rats with the converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril, 25 mg/kg, po daily for 14 days. Enalapril treatment decreased blood pressure in only SHR, inhibited plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity by 85%, and increased plasma ANG I concentration and renin activity in both WKY and SHR. In the untreated SHR animals, ANG II receptor concentrations were higher in the subfornical organ, the area postrema, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and the inferior olive when compared with the untreated WKY rats. Enalapril treatment produced a large decrease in only subfornical organ ANG II receptors of SHR. The selective reversal of the alteration in subfornical organ ANG II receptors in SHR may indicate a decreased central response to ANG II and may be related to the mode of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in this model.", 
    "332": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (blood pressure, heart rate, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, and plasma renin activity) of enalapril and enalaprilat were studied after oral administration of enalapril maleate (10 mg) to seven biopsy-proven cirrhotic patients and to seven healthy subjects. The mean Cmax, AUC, and urinary excretion of enalapril and enalaprilat were greater and less (p less than 0.01), respectively, and mean oral clearance of enalapril was less (p less than 0.01) in the cirrhotic group than in the healthy group. However, there was no significant difference in the mean total drug (enalapril plus enalaprilat) excretion between the two groups. Blood pressure fell (p less than 0.05) only at 3 or 4 hours postdose, with no change in heart rate in the two groups. Serum angiotensin-convering enzyme (ACE) decreased (p less than 0.001) and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased (p less than 0.05) in the two groups. The magnitude of the percentage of inhibition of ACE activity was comparable between the two groups. Serum enalaprilat concentration correlated (p less than 0.001) with the percentage of inhibition of ACE activity. The results suggest that the bioactivation of enalapril to enalaprilat is considerably impaired in patients with cirrhosis but that the pharmacodynamic effects do not appear to be blunted in those patients. The mechanism and clinical implications remained unclear.", 
    "333": "The impact of 4 antihypertensive drug regimens on blood pressure (BP) during everyday life stress and on BP during experimental stress in the laboratory was examined in an open clinical study. Sixty middle-aged men with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension never previously treated were treated either with low-dose clonidine (n = 10), oxprenolol (n = 20), nitrendipine (n = 20) or enalapril (n = 10). Before therapy, all 4 groups did not differ in age, weight, degree of obesity, BP at work site and casual BP measured in the outpatient clinic. After 6 months of effective therapy (casual BP within the normotensive range), casual diastolic BP was identical among the 4 groups, whereas systolic BP was lower in patients treated with clonidine or oxprenolol than in those who received enalapril. A disparate pattern of antihypertensive efficacy among the 4 groups emerged when stress BP was compared, with average ambulatory BP higher in patients receiving clonidine or enalapril than in those who had oxprenolol or nitrendipine. During ambulatory BP monitoring, patients treated with oxprenolol had the lowest level at each level of physical activity and self-reported emotional arousal. During bicycle exercise, patients receiving clonidine had the highest increase in systolic BP and those administered oxprenolol the lowest, whereas the BP response during mental stress was similar among all 4 therapeutic groups. The analysis of the hemodynamic response pattern during mental stress unmasked further disparities. Oxprenolol provoked an abnormal hemodynamic response during mental stress tests (increase in total peripheral resistance), whereas nitrendipine and enalapril preserved the physiological hemodynamic profile (decrease of total peripheral resistance).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "334": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether ACE-inhibitors could influence bronchial reactivity and interfere with inflammatory skin responses. Ten hypertensive subjects, who had reacted with coughs during ACE-inhibitor therapy, were treated in a double-blind crossover fashion for two weeks with enalapril and with placebo. Enalapril reduced the PC20 value for histamine and augmented the dermal response. Circulating eosinophilic leukocyte level in venous blood dropped markedly after the histamine bronchoprovocation performed during enalapril treatment. Plasma substance P was reduced after histamine provocation performed during placebo treatment, whereas this reduction was abolished by enalapril. In this study, we have demonstrated ACE-inhibitor-induction of moderately increased bronchial reactivity in subjects with suspected ACE-inhibitor-elicited coughs. It is suggested that coughing during ACE-inhibitor therapy is due to an increased inflammatory state in the airways.", 
    "335": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of 4 weeks of captopril treatment on cardiac mass and performance in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular mass of SHR and normotensive WKY rats was reduced (p less than 0.01). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) in the treated SHR and WKY were reduced; cardiac (CI) and stroke (SI) indices remained unaltered in SHR but increased in WKY. Ventricular performance (i.e., cardiac pumping ability), assessed by rapid blood infusion, did not differ between untreated SHR and WKY, and between treated and untreated WKY rats. However, the ventricular performance curves for the treated SHR shifted down and to the right from the untreated SHR (p less than 0.01). Moreover, when MAP of treated SHR (with regressed LV mass) was elevated to their pretreatment levels, cardiac performance curves shifted further rightward and downward. In contrast, the performance curves of treated WKY whose MAP was also elevated to the level of untreated WKY were no different from those of untreated WKY. These data demonstrate that captopril treatment (at doses used in this study) reduced MAP in SHR through decreased TPRI while decreasing biventricular mass. Furthermore, the cardiac-pumping ability of previously hypertrophied SHR hearts was reduced, suggesting that certain antihypertensive agents that diminish cardiac mass could produce impaired cardiac function when called upon to increase performance (e.g., when MAP is suddenly raised).", 
    "336": "The antihypertensive efficacy of a combination of calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in severe primary hypertension is well known, but a synergistic action of this drug combination in mild to moderate primary hypertension is still not established. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of monotherapy with nitrendipine (20 mg) or captopril (100 mg), and of their combination (nitrendipine 10 mg plus captopril 50 mg), in patients suffering from mild to moderate primary hypertension, according to a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. After the first 4-week monotherapy period, both nitrendipine and captopril induced a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, nitrendipine caused a significant increase in heart rate (HR), while no change in HR was observed in patients treated with captopril. Several side effects were observed, both in the nitrendipine-treated patients (facial flushing, headache, malleolar edema) and in the captopril-treated patients (initial hypotension, dizziness, gastrointestinal disorders). However, these side effects were mild and were well tolerated. In the second combined 4-week therapy period, systolic and diastolic BP of patients treated with 10 mg nitrendipine combined with 50 mg captopril continued to decrease to a degree significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than that observed at the end of the monotherapy period. Simultaneously, no change in HR values occurred when compared to basal values. Furthermore, the incidence and intensity of some side effects observed during the combined therapy period were lower than those of the monotherapy period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "337": "Despite a well-established rationale for pharmacologically induced arterial and venous vasodilatation in congestive heart failure, the clinical usefulness of long-term vasodilator therapy without concomitant converting-enzyme inhibition generally has been disappointing. With the exception of nitrates and, possibly, the combination of nitrates and hydralazine, the use of converting-enzyme inhibitors in many aspects appears preferable in the majority of patients. This article reviews the pathophysiology of inappropriate vasoconstriction in heart failure, the cellular mode of action of the various vasodilators, hemodynamic effects with respect to the peripheral site of action, clinical usefulness and limitations of different vasodilators, and the various determinants of clinical efficacy. Finally, an attempt is made to assess when and how to introduce vasodilator treatment with and without concomitant ACE inhibition.", 
    "338": "Zofenopril calcium (one-half calcium salt) is a prodrug ester analog of captopril whose biological effects are manifested by its active component, SQ 26,333. Because of the relative insolubilities of both zofenopril calcium and SQ 26,333, zofenopril potassium salt and SQ 26,703, the arginine salt of the active ACE (angiotensin I converting enzyme) inhibitory moiety of zofenopril, were employed in many of the following studies. The in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effects of zofenopril have been evaluated and comparisons have been made to captopril. In vitro, SQ 26,703 was more potent than captopril as an inhibitor of rabbit lung ACE (IC50 = 8 vs. 23 nM). SQ 26,703 was also a potent inhibitor of angiotensin I (AI)-induced contractions (EC50 = 3 nM) and a potentiator of bradykinin-induced contractions (EC50 = 1 nM) of isolated guinea pig ileum, while it had no effect on the inotropic effects of angiotensin II, BaCl2, PGE1, histamine, serotonin, or acetycholine in the same tissue, signifying that zofenopril is a specific inhibitor of ACE. In vivo, the potency of SQ 26,703 was equal to or greater than that of captopril as an inhibitor of an AI pressor response when given intravenously to rats, dogs, and monkeys. After oral administration of equimolar doses, zofenopril was the more effective and longer lasting ACE inhibitor in all three species. In SHR, doses of 6.6 and 22.0 mg/kg, p.o. lowered pressure by 20 and 33 mm Hg, respectively, while 30 mg/kg of captopril lowered pressure by 25 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "339": "New evidence shows that systemic and intrarenal hemodynamic abnormalities are major factors in the initiation and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Genetic predisposition to elevated systemic blood pressure may contribute to its development. Glomerular vasodilation and hyperfiltration, mediated in part by prostaglandins, may play a role in glomerular damage early in the course of diabetes, but clinical studies are limited. The development of more sensitive assays for albuminuria now allows early diagnosis of incipient nephropathy in the \"microalbuminuria\" phase. Treatment during this phase with antihypertensive agents, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or with dietary protein restriction, can decrease the degree of albuminuria, but data on their long-term effects on disease progression are limited. In hypertensive patients with established clinical diabetic nephropathy characterized by proteinuria in excess of 0.3 to 0.5 g/d, antihypertensive therapy has a major impact on delaying renal failure. Modalities that lower both systemic and intraglomerular pressure may be more beneficial in preserving renal function than those that primarily lower systemic pressure. Any therapeutic intervention should be monitored meticulously to establish its efficacy and safety in the individual patient. Therapy specifically directed against hemodynamic abnormalities throughout the course of diabetic renal disease may significantly delay and decrease the negative impact of this diabetic complication on survival and quality of life.", 
    "340": "The importance of left ventricular (LV) shape in determining exercise capacity was assessed in 40 male patients with LV dysfunction after anterior acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Because captopril therapy is known to improve exercise capacity in this patient population, the potential interaction between LV shape and captopril therapy was also evaluated. Patients underwent cardiac catheterization 2 to 4 weeks after AMI followed by randomization to receive placebo or captopril. LV shape was defined from biplane ventriculography by a sphericity index (volume observed/volume of sphere using long axis as diameter). Quarterly clinical assessments and maximal exercise testing were performed. A cumulative heart failure score, specific activity scale and average exercise time for the year were calculated. A greater shape distortion (increasing sphericity index) was associated with increased LV volumes, decreased ejection fraction and a larger abnormally contracting segment. Sphericity index was the only independent predictor of average exercise duration in the placebo group. Placebo-treated patients in the tercile with the most spherical ventricles had not only the lowest exercise capacity (p less than 0.01), but also accumulated the highest heart failure (p less than 0.05) and specific activity scale (p less than 0.05) scores. Captopril-treated patients with the same baseline distortion of LV shape did not manifest these shape-dependent objective and subjective measures of reduced functional capacity.",

NEP activity was found not only on already classified CALLA + ve cells but also on numerous cells (including mature B and polyclonal T cells) previously considered as CALLA-ve. This suggests that CALLA/NEP is expressed all along the differentiation pathway in B and T cell lineage. Moreover substantial ACE-like activity was also detected in three tested cells, all of the pre-B phenotype. The availability of specific inhibitors for these enzymes should help clarify their role in cell-differentiation.", 
    "342": "In a randomized and double-blind study of 116 patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA classes II or III) the effectiveness of captopril + hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) (group 1) and of digoxin + HCT (group 2) were compared. Treatment was effected for a 12-month period with a combination of 50 mg captopril (twice 25 mg daily, oral) and HCT, or 0.2 mg digoxin (twice 0.1 mg daily, oral) and HCT. In a pretreatment phase over 3-4 weeks the patients of group 1 were given an average HCT dose of 37.7 mg daily, whereas those of group 2 received 34.9 mg per day. At the end of the 12-month treatment period the patients in the captopril/HCT group had improved significantly more--by the criteria of echocardiographic intracardiac diameters, exercise tolerance and NYHA class--than those in the digoxin/HCT group. Change by a mean of one NYHA class had occurred in 61 patients (51.8%) of group 1 and in 47 (40.7%) of group 2 (P les than 0.01). These findings suggest that treatment of patients with mild to moderately severe chronic heart failure in sinus rhythm best be initiated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor together with a diuretic rather than a digitalis-diuretic combination.", 
    "343": "According to major surveys, hypertension is found in over half the population aged 65 years or over. In this age group, systolic blood pressure is at least as important as diastolic blood pressure as a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Overall, the presence of hypertension is associated with approximately a threefold increase in the likelihood of major events. Differing factors contribute to the hypertension. Loss of proximal arterial compliance, affecting the larger conduit vessels, occurs often with aging and explains the tendency for systolic pressure to increase while diastolic pressure remains constant or even decreases. A loss of baroreceptor sensitivity also may contribute to hypertension. There is an increase in responsiveness of the sympathetic nervous system and an enhanced sensitivity to its effects in the elderly, perhaps reflecting a decline in the buffering activity of peripheral vascular beta receptors. It is possible, too, that sodium retention may contribute to hypertension in some older patients. Although diuretics traditionally have been the mainstay of treatment in these patients, it is now recognized that other classes of antihypertensive agents may be equally as effective yet less prone to metabolic or symptomatic adverse events. Sympatholytic drugs, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, either as monotherapy or in combination with low-dose diuretics, have been shown to be efficacious in the elderly. These agents also can produce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, an additional property that may contribute to a reduction in serious cardiac complications.",

    "345": "Carboxypeptidase A-catalyzed hydrolysis of peptides and depsipeptides is competitively inhibited by N-(1-carboxy-5-t-butyloxycarbonylaminopentyl)-L-phenylalanine (Boc-CA-Phe, Ki = 1.3 microM) and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, N-(1-carboxy-5-carbobenzoxyaminopentyl)-glycyl-L-phenylalanine (Z-CA-Gly-Phe, Ki = 4.5 microM). The latter compound is actually a slow substrate of carboxypeptidase. Indirect observation of inhibitor binding by stopped-flow measurement of radiationless energy transfer between carboxypeptidase tryptophans and dansylated substrates reveals slow binding for both compounds. The visible absorption spectrum of the complex of cobalt(II)-substituted carboxypeptidase and Z-CA-Gly-Phe, which differs from the corresponding spectrum of the Boc-CA-Phe complex, is remarkable in its resemblance to the spectrum of the complex between Co(II)carboxypeptidase and a transient intermediate previously observed during hydrolysis of peptide substrates. The spectrum slowly changes to that of the free enzyme indicating hydrolysis. Chromatographic quantitation of substrate and products confirms that carboxypeptidase converts Z-CA-Gly-Phe to Z-CA-Gly and L-Phe with an apparent kcat of 0.02 s-1. Absorption spectroscopy indicates that the Z-CA-Gly-Phe-Co(II)carboxypeptidase spectrum is not that of bound products. Moreover, spectral titrations indicate that the products (both with spectral Ki values of about 3 mM), as well as D-Phe, compete for the same site on the enzyme.",

    "347": "The hypothesis that facilitation of noradrenaline release by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors is linked to the local generation of angiotensin II was investigated in rat tail artery and mouse atria which were incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline. The outflow of radioactivity induced by electrical field stimulation of the tissues was taken as an index of noradrenaline release. In mouse atria, angiotensin II (0.01 microM) enhanced the stimulation-induced (S-I) noradrenaline release and this was blocked by saralasin (0.1 microM). Isoprenaline (0.01 microM) also enhanced the S-I release of noradrenaline, but this was not blocked by either saralasin (0.1 microM and 0.3 microM) or captopril (5 microM). Furthermore, the facilitatory effects of angiotensin II (0.1 microM) and isoprenaline (0.1 microM) were additive. In rat tail artery, the facilitatory effect of angiotensin II (0.01 microM) on noradrenaline release was blocked by saralasin (0.1 microM). The facilitatory effect of isoprenaline (0.1 microM) was blocked by propranolol (1 microM) but not by saralasin (0.1 microM) nor captopril (5 microM). These results indicate that beta-adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of noradrenaline release occurs independently of angiotensin II in mouse atria and rat tail artery.", 
    "348": "Metabolic changes in essential hypertension may complicate the primary disease, or drug and nondrug intervention, or both. These changes include disturbances in renal function, the metabolism of urate, glucose and lipids, and in cation transport across plasma membranes. Some of these disorders may be worsened by the chronic administration of antihypertensive drugs like diuretics, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Recent randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs showed that the apparently adequate control of hypertension with a thiazide or beta-antagonist does not consistently prevent cerebrovascular and cardiac deaths and morbidity, and that beta-antagonists protect only nonsmoking men against cardiac death. One explanation is that blood pressure may not have been lowered enough. By contrast, cardiac deaths may be increased in patients whose diastolic pressure is reduced below 85-90 mmHg. The adverse metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs may in part offset their protective benefits. However, population evidence does not support the general avoidance of thiazides or beta-antagonists in mild hypertension. Where possible drug treatment should be tailored to individuals according to their general condition, age, and any concurrent disease or medication.", 
    "349": "(1) Maintenance of blood pressure was investigated during induction of pentobarbital anaesthesia in rats after elimination of capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons (capsaicin-denervated rats) as compared to vehicle-treated controls. The catecholamine content of heart and adrenals and the rise in blood pressure following electrical excitation of the spinal adrenergic nerves (pithed rat preparation) was also compared between both groups. (2) Capsaicin-denervated rats and their controls had equal amounts of catecholamines in heart and adrenals as well as equal pressor responses to electrical stimulation of spinal sympathetic nerves, thus excluding an influence of capsaicin on efferent pathways. In the state of consciousness, both groups showed the same blood pressure. (3) In capsaicin-denervated rats and in their controls, pentobarbital-induced anaesthesia (50 mg/kg i.p.) was characterized by a decline in blood pressure during the first 6 min. In the controls, this fall in blood pressure was followed by a slow compensatory rise to a level slightly higher than before anaesthesia, and this level was maintained during the following 60 min. This compensation was completely absent in capsaicin-denervated rats, indicating a role for capsaicin-sensitive nerves in this mechanism. An injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.) in pithed rats reduced the pressor response to electrical stimulation of spinal sympathetic nerves by about 40% in capsaicindenervated rats and in their controls. This inhibitory effect of pentobarbital might be involved in the initial fall in blood pressure in intact animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

To verify the glomerular and tubular effects of short term converting enzyme inhibition, thirteen patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (WHO I-II) were treated orally either with perindopril (4 mg o.d.) or captopril (25 mg b.i.d.) for one week. Both drugs reduced supine mean blood pressure significantly (p less than 0.01) (perindopril from 126 +/- 11 to 108 +/- 7 mmHg, mean +/- SD, and captopril from 132 +/- 12 to 121 +/- 16). Plasma volume (radio-iodinated albumin space) was unchanged while mean extracellular fluid volume (inulin space) increased although not significantly (from 5.05 +/- 1.32 l/sqm to 5.71 +/- 2.21 with perindopril and from 4.96 +/- 2.6 to 5.6 +/- 1.7 with captopril).

    "352": "While antihypertensive therapy is considered to be an important clinical intervention in hypertensive patients, its effects on cardiac structure and function have not been intensely evaluated. In this study we tested the hypotheses that lowering blood pressure (BP) with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, would: 1) normalize left ventricular mass and increase the cardiocyte mitochondria/myofibrils volume (Vmito/Vmyo) ratio; and 2) not compromise peak ventricular performance. We treated 16-week-old SHR and WKY with captopril (40-80 mg/kg) and hydrochlorothiazide (500 mg/l) via their drinking water. After six weeks of treatment peak cardiac performance was measured during rapid volume overload. Tissue samples from the left ventricular wall were analyzed by electron microscopy and stereology. Captopril lowered BP in SHR and WKY but had no affect on the left ventricular/body weight ratio. The only intracellular change in treated SHR was an increase in sarcoplasmic volume density. Treated WKY exhibited decreased midmyocardial mitochondrial volume density. At peak cardiac output, acceleration of flow and cardiac index were not affected by treatment. Stroke work at peak cardiac output was decreased in the treated groups due to a decrease in mean arterial pressure. In addition, captopril treatment resulted in a shift of the cardiac output (CO)-left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) curves, such that LVEDP at peak cardiac output was approximately 50% less in the treated groups compared to their respective control groups. Although captopril was efficacious in lowering BP, it is suggested that lowering BP with this agent does not, at least within six weeks, lead to a reversal of hypertrophy or to a significant alteration in the volume densities of myofibrils and mitochondria. However, an important effect of this antihypertensive drug which may be of clinical significance, is that it leads to a leftward shift of the CO-LVEDP curve in both hypertensive and normotensive rats.",

It was noted functional activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increases with a progress of the disease (decompensation). Changes occur not only in the basal level of plasma reninactivity and circulating aldosterone concentration, but also the 24 hour rhythm to the side of an increased hormonal level during the evening hours, evidencing thus for disadaption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its decreased reliability under conditions of habitual life activity. Administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor, Captopril, has confirmed a pathogenetic role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the development of cardiac failure syndrome in the chronic IHK patients as well as verified a new approach in the treatment of this pathology.",

After intravenous infusion over 30 min at a rate of 100 ml h-1, doses of 50, 125 and 250 micrograms kg-1 appear to induce a long-lasting inhibition of plasma renin activity. Plasma angiotensin II was decreased in a dose-dependent manner during the infusion and thereafter reverted to the initial level. A concomitant dose-related increase in active plasma renin was observed. Blood pressure was unaffected. The plasma levels of CGP 38 560 reached during infusion were at least 2000-fold higher than the theoretical inhibitory concentration based on in vitro results. 3.

In rabbit aorta, they competitively inhibited the contractile response to angiotensin II with pA2 values of 6.54 and 7.20 and did not alter the response to norepinephrine or KCl. In guinea pig ileum, both agents blocked the responses to angiotensin I and II and did not alter the responses to bradykinin and acetylcholine. A similar specific angiotensin II antagonism was shown in vivo in the spinal pithed rat model. In renal artery-ligated rats, a high renin hypertensive model, EXP6155 and EXP6803 given intravenously, decreased blood pressure with ED30 of 10 and 11 mg/kg, respectively. Both compounds did not alter blood pressure when given orally at 100 mg/kg. Unlike saralasin, EXP6155 and EXP6803 given intravenously did not cause a transient increase in blood pressure in the renal artery-ligated and normotensive rats. Our results indicate that EXP6155 and EXP6803 are selective angiotensin II receptor antagonists and antihypertensive agents. Since neither compound had partial agonist activities or bradykinin potentiation effects, unlike the existing peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, respectively, they may represent preferred probes for studying the physiological roles of angiotensin II.",

However, in 14-15-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) renal sensory receptor stimulation failed to elicit a contralateral inhibitory renorenal reflex response. The present study was performed to examine whether the lack of a renorenal reflex response in SHR was related to elevated arterial pressure by studying the responses to renal sensory receptor stimulation in 5-6-week-old SHR and in 12-16-week-old SHR that had been treated with captopril from 3 weeks of age to prevent the development of hypertension. In 5-6-week-old SHR, mean arterial pressure was 113 +/- 3 mm Hg. Graded increases of ureteral pressure of 15 and 29 mm Hg resulted in graded increases in ipsilateral afferent renal nerve activity of 57 +/- 22% and 120 +/- 38%. Contralateral urinary sodium excretion increased from 0.26 +/- 0.06 to 0.35 +/- 0.07 mumol/min/g and from 0.36 +/- 0.08 to 0.46 +/- 0.11 mumol/min/g, respectively. In captopril-treated SHR, mean arterial pressure was 109 +/- 3 mm Hg. Increasing ureteral pressure by 34 mm Hg increased ipsilateral afferent renal nerve activity 65 +/- 21% and contralateral urinary sodium excretion from 1.28 +/- 0.24 to 1.53 +/- 0.30 mumol/min/g. Similar results were produced by renal chemoreceptor stimulation. It is concluded that renal sensory receptor stimulation results in a contralateral inhibitory renorenal reflex response in 5-6-week-old SHR and in SHR treated with captopril to prevent the development of hypertension. These results suggest that the previously demonstrated lack of a renorenal reflex response to renal sensory receptor stimulation in hypertensive SHR is related to the maintenance of hypertension.",

Intravenous or intraventricular injections yielded different renal effects with the different forms. Additional work is presented supporting the hypothesis that these forms are functionally different. Renin form 2 (pI = 5.7), form 4 (pI = 5.2) or form 6 (pI = 4.8) was infused intravenously (IV) in Spague-Dawley rats. The total renin infused over 30 minutes was the amount that could generate 1000 ng angiotensin I (Ang I)/h/100g body weight. Arterial blood pressure, urine volume, sodium, and potassium excretion were determined at 15-minute intervals. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentrations were measured 45 minutes after the start of infusion of renin forms. Infusion of renin form 4 increased urine volume and sodium excretion significantly. Renin forms 2 and 6 were without effect on renal excretion in spite of the fact that the same activity was infused. Both PRA and aldosterone concentrations after renin infusions were similar for all groups. Nonrenin renal protein with the same pI as form 4 was used as a control. This preparation was inactive and implies that our data with renin form 4 were not the result of contamination with a nonrenin protein having a pI of 5.2. In addition, the urinary responses could not be attributable to change in renal perfusion pressure as arterial blood pressure was not altered. These data support the hypothesis that there are functional differences among the different renin forms.", 
    "359": "Evidence concerning the clinical utility of single dose captopril in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension was evaluated. Of 173 identified papers, 16 were specifically selected because they used single dose oral captopril and obtained pre-dose and post-dose peripheral renin levels in at least one patient with renovascular hypertension. These 16 studies were appraised independently by three reviewers using standardized forms for evaluation of diagnostic tests. The 16 studies included 805 patients. All studies involved referred hypertensive populations; detailed demographics and clinical characteristics were not provided. Captopril test procedures varied in all studies. Thirteen of 16 studies used arteriography as a gold standard for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, and three of 16 used surgical outcome data. In ten studies, patients with renovascular hypertension clearly had a significantly greater increase in plasma renin activity than patients with essential hypertension. In the remaining six, plasma renin activity was increased in patients with renovascular hypertension but control comparisons were not made adequately. Existing data suggest that the captopril test may be useful in identifying patients with renovascular hypertension. However, specific clinical recommendations regarding its use cannot be made until future research better defines test cutoff points and identifies which patients are most likely to benefit from the test.",

The examination on day 1 served as a control for day 2 during which captopril (25 mg) was given orally one hour before measurements of PRC and DTPA clearance. Blood pressure was reduced by captopril in both groups, but the maximum decrease in systolic BP was slightly more pronounced (P less than .01) in RVH (22%, median) than EH (13%). Plasma renin concentration increased to a much greater extent (P less than .01) after captopril in RVH (366%) than in EH (46%), Single kidney 99mTc-DTPA clearance was significantly (P less than .01) reduced (-39.5%) and MTT considerably prolonged (170%) on the affected/most affected side in RVH, but both parameters were only slightly changed or unchanged on the unaffected/least affected side (-6.5%, -2% respectively) and were not significantly changed in any of the sides in EH. The degree of renal artery stenosis was significantly correlated to the increase in PRC (rho = -0.786, n = 14 patients, P less than .01), to the reduction in single kidney 99mTc-DTPA clearance (rho = 0.729, n = 19 kidneys, P less than .01) and to the prolongation in MTT (rho = -0.785, n = 16 kidneys, P less than .01). By analysis of the captopril-induced changes in 99mTc-DTPA clearance and MTT, it was possible to predict the existence of a moderate to several renal artery stenosis in arterial hypertension with a very high degree of probability, and the use of changes in 99mTc-DTPA clearance and MTT after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may become a valuable tool in differentiation between RVH and EH.",

The results were compared with saline-injected time controls. PEG injection elicited an early (30 min) selective mesenteric vasoconstriction in Long-Evans rats; 4-5 h after PEG the mesenteric vasoconstriction was greater in Long-Evans than in Brattleboro rats, but the renal and hindquarters vasoconstrictions were similar in both strains. There was a transient mesenteric vasodilatation [with no change in blood pressure (BP)] in Long-Evans rats given an antagonist of the V1-receptor actions of AVP 5 h after PEG. In the presence of the AVP antagonist, Long-Evans rats showed a marked dependence on the vasoconstrictor actions of the renin-angiotensin system for the maintenance of BP, similar to Brattleboro rats. Both strains also showed marked hypotensive responses to inhibition of sympathoadrenal activity (with pentolinium). Hence, AVP has clear-cut hemodynamic effects after PEG administration, but its role is not indispensable.",

The effect of Na and Cl deprivation or selective Na deprivation on BP in the normotensive Sprague-Dawley rat was investigated. In study 1, rats were uninephrectomized and fed low NaCl, normal NaCl, or low Na-normal Cl for 3 wk. BP was higher (P less than 0.05) in rats fed low NaCl and low Na-normal Cl than normal NaCl. Plasma renin activity was stimulated by low NaCl intake but was not different between the other two groups. After captopril treatment, BP was lower in the low NaCl group (73.1 +/- 3.6 mmHg) than in the normal-NaCl (99.2 +/- 6.7 mmHg) or low Na-normal Cl (92.0 +/- 6.7 mmHg) groups. In study 2, intact rats (n = 8 per group) were fed low (less than 0.01%), normal (1%), or high NaCl (4%) for 1 wk.

The result is that the rat achieves external sodium balance, in which intake equals excretion, on the new low intake within a few hours. In this study, we assessed the rate of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and its contribution to blood pressure during that interval. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentration had risen sharply within 8 h and did not change over the next 40 h. Plasma aldosterone concentration, on the other hand, continued to rise over 48 h. Within 8 h, blood pressure dependency on angiotensin II had increased sharply, as assessed by depressor responses to an angiotensin antagonist (Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II) and to converting-enzyme inhibition (captopril). The depressor response to neither agent changed over the next 40 h. The pressor response to angiotensin II was blunted significantly by 8 h and also did not change over the next 40 h. The findings indicate that the rapid tempo of sodium homeostasis in the rat is matched by an equally rapid tempo of activation of the renin-angiotensin system, although the factors responsible for aldosterone release are probably more complex. Experiments to assess the renin-angiotensin system in the rat must be designed with this rapid tempo in mind.", 
    "364": "One-hundred five hypertensive patients underwent conventional renal scintigraphy followed 2 or 3 days later by Captopril-enhanced renal scintigraphy, performed 1 hr after premedication with 50 mg of Captopril per os. All patients were then submitted to renal arteriography, performed within 15-30 days. Fifty-five patients had no renal artery stenosis, 29 had unilateral disease, and 21 bilateral. Overall, 34/37 patients were diagnosed by the provocative test as having at least one renal artery affected by a stenosis greater than 50%. Of those with no stenosis (n = 55) or stenosis less than 50% (n = 13) only two cases were falsely positive. Thus sensitivity was 92% and specificity 97%. For single kidney identification with stenosis greater than 50%, sensitivity of renal scintigraphy after Captopril administration was 94% and specificity 98%. Captopril enhanced renal scintigraphy is thus suggested as the first test to be performed in hypertensive patients referred for renal scintigraphic studies. Only those cases with equivocal results require a baseline study for better assessment.", 
    "365": "The role of a renin-angiotensin-like system (RAS) in the regulation of blood pressure and drinking has been investigated in the elasmobranch, Scyliorhinus canicula. Injection of exogenous angiotensin II produced, as expected, a vasopressor response, though injection of the converting enzyme inhibitor, Captopril, alone produced little change in resting blood pressure. Papaverine, a smooth muscle relaxant, reduced blood pressure which completely recovered within 30 min. A subsequent injection of Captopril produced a rapid vasodepressor response with no recovery over 2 hr. The low basal levels of drinking in dogfish were not altered by Captopril injection but angiotensin II-induced increased drinking and papaverine administration resulted in markedly stimulated water intake, which was inhibited by coadministration with Captopril. Captopril inhibition of the recovery in blood pressure and associated dipsogenic response following the papaverine-induced hypotension is consistent with the activation of a RAS-like system in the dogfish. This and other evidence supporting the presence of a RAS-like system in elasmobranchs are discussed in relation to other vertebrates.", 
    "366": "Cost-effectiveness analysis, a set of methods for estimating the costs and health effects of medical interventions, helps decision makers to compare alternative treatments and to decide which interventions are appropriate in which situations. This article outlines some fundamental principles of cost-effectiveness analysis and discusses the characteristics necessary if alternative therapies are to be more cost-effective than traditional drug treatment for hypertension. The discussion focuses primarily on the newer drugs like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists.", 
    "367": "When diuretic-based stepped care was first advocated for the treatment of hypertension, there were fewer classes of antihypertensive medication than there are today. In 1984, the third Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) for the first time suggested an alternative initial treatment with a beta-blocker in selected hypertensive patients, and the fourth JNC report has recommended the alternatives of calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for step-one therapy as well. However, only the diuretic drugs and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in prospective, long-term, controlled trials. Moreover, 30 years' experience with diuretic agents and 20 years' experience with beta-blockers have defined the advantages, disadvantages, and potential side effects of these drugs more precisely than is possible for newer agents. The diuretic drugs and beta-blockers remain excellent choices in the management of hypertension.", 
    "368": "1. The synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane (TX) B2 by isolated glomeruli, cortical tubules, inner medullary slices and outer medullary slices was measured in salt-depleted (LNa) rats and in salt-depleted rats receiving captopril (LNa-CEI). Animals were studied before and after 4, 9 and 15 days of Na+ depletion. 2. Na+ balance was reached in LNa rats after 4 days. Blood pressure and creatinine clearance remained stable. Serum Na+ decreased from 140 +/- 1 to 126 +/- 1 mmol/l (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01). In contrast, LNa-CEI rats were unable to conserve Na+ adequately: fractional excretion of Na+ and natriuresis were constantly greater than in LNa animals. As a consequence, LNa-CEI rats developed severe hyponatraemia, lost weight and their creatinine clearance decreased. 3. The glomerular synthesis of PGE2, PGF2 alpha and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, but not of TXB2, was significantly increased in LNa rats. In LNa-CEI rats, the synthesis of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was similar to control values, but PGF2 alpha and TXB2 synthesis was elevated at day 9. In cortical tubules, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were unaffected by Na+ depletion, but 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 were increased and a similar trend was observed in LNa-CEI rats. In outer medulla of LNa rats, a decrease in all the eicosanoids measured was observed at day 4. In LNa-CEI animals, the synthesis of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, but not of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2, was significantly depressed. In inner medulla, Na+ depletion only tended to decrease PGF2 alpha and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, but in the presence of captopril, the synthesis of all prostanoids was significantly decreased.", 
    "369": "1. The function of angiotensin converting enzyme was investigated in twenty-four healthy men. Forearm blood flow was measured under basal conditions and during administration of enalaprilat (a converting enzyme inhibitor) and/or peptide substrates of converting enzyme into the left brachial artery. Blood flow was compared in the two arms. 2. Enalaprilat had no effect on basal blood flow. The concentration of enalaprilat in venous blood from the control arm was low, and plasma renin activity was not increased, indicating that systemic inhibition of converting enzyme did not occur. 3. Effects of angiotensin and of bradykinin, administered intra-arterially, were limited to the infused arm. Enalaprilat (13 nmol min-1) inhibited converting enzyme in the infused arm, in which it caused approximately a 100-fold reduction in sensitivity to angiotensin I, while having no effect on the vasoconstriction caused by angiotensin II. Enalaprilat increased vasodilatation caused by bradykinin. 4. Aspirin, an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, did not inhibit vasodilatation caused by bradykinin whether infused alone or with enalaprilat, indicating that these responses are not mediated by prostaglandins. 5. We conclude that under basal conditions neither conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II nor degradation of bradykinin determines resistance vessel tone in the human forearm. Converting enzyme may affect vascular tone in situations in which intravascular concentrations of peptides are increased over those present under basal conditions.", 
    "370": "The new orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril was evaluated in normotensive men. Doses of 2 to 16 mg were given once a day for up to one week. Single oral doses of perindopril were found to blunt the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I in a dose-dependent manner. The drug-induced ACE inhibition, as estimated by the measurement of plasma ACE activity, was maximal 4 to 8 hours post drug intake. ACE activity was still importantly reduced 24 hours after dosing. Plasma levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone decreased significantly whereas plasma renin activity and blood angiotensin I levels rose during peak ACE inhibition induced by the 4 and 8 mg doses. However, circulating levels of angiotensin II returned to baseline 24 hours after dosing, both on the first day of treatment and after one week of administration. ACE inhibition with perindopril did not affect blood pressure and heart rate in any consistent manner. There was no evidence for drug accumulation during repeated administration. The novel ACE inhibitor was well tolerated and produced no change in routine laboratory tests. The long-acting ACE inhibitor perindopril appears therefore to be effective when given orally in a dose range of 4 to 16 mg.", 
    "371": "Ambulatory blood pressure recordings and stress blood pressures during exercise were compared among hypertensive patients effectively treated with oxprenolol, nitrendipine, enalapril or low-dose clonidine. After 6 months of therapy, the means of blood pressure at rest and casual diastolic pressure were nearly identical among the four therapeutic groups. Although all pressures fell to within the normotensive range, casual systolic pressures were lower in patients treated with sympatholytic agents than in those taking enalapril. In contrast, average ambulatory blood pressure was less controlled in patients given clonidine or enalapril than in those given oxprenolol or nitrendipine. During physical stress patients taking clonidine showed the highest stress blood pressures and those taking oxprenolol the lowest pressures. The study demonstrated that although blood pressure was reduced to within the normotensive range in all four therapeutic groups, analysis of values of ambulatory blood pressure and stress blood pressure during physical activity showed a disparate pattern of antihypertensive efficacy.", 
    "372": "This study has evaluated the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor Enalapril on glomerular ultrastructure and albuminuria in normotensive and hypertensive diabetic rats. Streptozotocin-diabetes was induced in Wistar Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Enalapril was administered in drinking water in diabetic normotensive, control hypertensive and diabetic hypertensive rats. Enalapril therapy prevented an increase in glomerular basement membrane thickness in diabetic normotensive, control hypertensive and diabetic hypertensive rats without any significant effect on fractional mesangial volume. Enalapril decreased albuminuria in diabetic normotensive, control hypertensive and diabetic hypertensive rats. Thus, enalapril retards the development of glomerular basement membrane thickening and albuminuria in the rat, in the presence or absence of hypertension.", 
    "373": "Persistent anuria was diagnosed in a neonate born to a mother whose pregnancy was complicated by severe hypertension and systemic lupus erythematosus. Severe maternal hypertension necessitated the use of a battery of antihypertensive medications that included enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The role of enalapril in neonatal renal failure is discussed.", 
    "374": "Inhibition of brain converting enzyme (CE) has been implicated in the antihypertensive action of some CE inhibitors. However, it is still a matter of debate whether these drugs gain access to the central nervous system upon systemic administration. In this study in rats we investigated the ability of p.o. applied CE inhibitors to penetrate from blood into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by analyzing the inhibition of CE activity in the CSF after acute bolus and after 1 week overnight treatment with enalapril, ramipril and Hoe 288. Penetration into the CSF closely paralleled the lipid solubility of the drugs. The most lipophilic drug, Hoe 288 (10 mg/kg), inhibited CE activity in the CSF after acute (66%) and after chronic (30%) p.o. treatment. Ramipril (10 mg/kg), being less lipophilic than Hoe 288, was only effective after acute bolus administration (59% inhibition), whereas the most hydrophilic drug, enalapril (30 mg/kg), did not reduce CE activity in the CSF after either regimen. The CE inhibition in the CSF after acute p.o. treatment with ramipril and Hoe 288 was dose-dependent with threshold doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg (ramipril) and less than 1 mg/kg (Hoe 288). The presence of ramipril and Hoe 288 in the CSF was also demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of heat-inactivated CSF from CE inhibitor-treated rats on purified CE from rabbit lung. A comparison of the in vitro activities of the three prodrugs and their parent diacids against CE in plasma and in CSF and against purified CE revealed hydrolysis of the prodrugs to their parent diacids in plasma and CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "375": "Overdose with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is still a relatively underreported phenomenon. We report here a case of an unintentional overdose of enalapril (100 mg) together with other medications. The patient experienced no adverse consequences. Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed a t 1/2 for enalaprilat (prodrug) of seven hours and for enalapril at 36 hours. Based on this case report as well as others, guidelines for assessment and treatment of these patients are proposed. Management of hypotension is the primary therapeutic intervention.", 
    "376": "We have previously shown that enalapril, when given acutely to renovascular patients, exerted a dose-dependent hypotensive effect. To address the same problem in chronically treated essential hypertensives, we studied 116 uncomplicated essential hypertensives, whose diastolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg at the end of a two-week placebo run-in period (time 0). According to a randomized crossover design, these patients received three doses (10, 20, or 40 mg) of enalapril qd and a placebo, each treatment being given for one month. At the end of each treatment period as well as at time 0, blood pressure and heart rate were measured 24 hours after the last dosing. In spite of a two-week run-in placebo period, placebo treatment further and significantly reduced blood pressure; however enalapril further and significantly reduced blood pressure when compared to placebo. Although absolute blood pressure values after 40 mg of enalapril were significantly lower than those after 10 mg of enalapril the relevance of this difference, mainly when compared to placebo, seems to be inconsistent. Taken together these data suggest that the hypotensive effect of enalapril chronically given to essential hypertensives and measured 24 hours after last dosing, is dose independent.", 
    "377": "During the course of a long-term, prospective, randomized study in 77 hypertensive nephrosclerosis patients, five patients developed evidence suggestive of renal artery stenosis. However, arteriography demonstrated patent renal arteries. The evidence suggestive of renal artery stenosis was: (1) converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI)-induced renal dysfunction including marked and reversible increases in serum creatinine and urea concentrations, (2) minoxidil-induced hyperreninemia despite beta-adrenoceptor blockade and volume expansion, and (3) minoxidil-induced salt and water retention with diuretic resistant edema. Thus, the renal dysfunction induced by CEI in these patients with patent renal arteries is similar to the alterations occurring in patients having bilateral renal artery stenosis. The diuretic resistant edema and the beta-adrenoceptor blocker resistant high renin release are also functional alterations of renal artery stenosis. We suspect that the long-standing and usually severe hypertension in these patients has caused sufficient arteriolar hypertrophy or sclerosis to interfere with renal blood flow and to induce these functional lesions of renal artery stenosis. With widespread use of the new CEI agents in patients with renal disease, this syndrome suggestive of renal artery stenosis may be encountered in as many as 10% of hypertensive nephrosclerosis patients during long-term treatment with converting-enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "378": "Iodine-123 hippurate renography, [99mTc]diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) renography, and [99mTc]dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy were performed before and during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in a group of 15 hypertensive patients with angiographically \"significant\" unilateral renal artery stenosis. Visual and quantitative evaluation of the three radioisotope methods before ACE inhibition already disclosed abnormalities suggestive of renal artery stenosis in a high percentage (87%, 60%, and 60%, respectively) in this group of patients, but ACE inhibition further improved the diagnostic yield in all three methods (93%, 86%, and 80%). Iodine-123 hippurate renography was at least as useful as [99mTc]DTPA renography in this respect, while [99mTc]DMSA scintigraphy can be used particularly in segmental stenosis. Despite a large drop in blood pressure after ACE inhibition little adverse reactions were seen and overall renal function was fairly well maintained, the exceptions noted in patients with initially a more impaired renal function.", 
    "379": "The peptides bradykinin and kallidin are released in response to noxious stimuli and mediate various physiological effects, including a direct stimulation of nociceptive afferent neurones. The nature of the receptor molecules through which these ligands act is presently unknown. We synthesised an iodinatable photoaffinity probe, N epsilon-4-azidosalicylylkallidin, and used it in an attempt to identify candidate bradykinin receptors on the NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cell line. The ligand bound in subdued light to a particulate fraction of NG108-15 tumours and could be displaced by bradykinin with an IC50 of 0.33 nM. In a physiological assay, it behaved as an agonist equipotent with bradykinin. Gel analysis of the labelled products after photolysis of the iodinated ligand in the presence of NG108-15 cells or tumour membranes revealed bradykinin-blockable labelling of a glycoprotein with an Mr of 166,000. The probe was also able to label purified commercial angiotensin converting enzyme. The band labelled in NG108-15 cells was immunoprecipitable with a polyclonal antiserum to angiotensin converting enzyme, an enzyme shown to be present in low amounts in these preparations by direct binding using the iodinatable specific ligand MK351A.", 
    "380": "The effect of enalapril on left ventricular (LV) morphology and function was studied in 12 hypertensive patients. The subjects were evaluated after 2 weeks of placebo and after 4 months of treatment with enalapril (20 or 40 mg once daily), using M-mode digitized echocardiograms. The drug reduced arterial blood pressure in all patients. Systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly without changes in cardiac output and heart rate. No patient had significant side effects. After treatment LV mass decreased significantly (233 +/- 46 to 204 +/- 37 g, p less than 0.01); the reduction was due to a decrease in septal and posterior wall thickness, without changes in LV diameter. LV systolic function remained unchanged, whereas peak lengthening rate of LV dimension, an index of LV diastolic function, increased significantly (4.05 +/- 1.8 to 5.11 +/- 1.8 s-1, p less than 0.01). After treatment the basal inverse correlation between peak shortening rate and wall stress did not change, the inverse correlation between peak lengthening rate and wall stress became closer and the basal inverse correlation between peak lengthening rate and LV mass disappeared. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment with enalapril led to a significant regression of LV hypertrophy associated with improvement in LV diastolic performance and no deterioration of LV systolic function.", 
    "381": "A randomized, parallel, double-blind study was performed with lisinopril, a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, versus captopril, a shorter-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in the treatment of congestive heart failure. All patients were in New York Heart Association class II, III or IV and had remained symptomatic despite therapy with digoxin and diuretics. After a 4 to 14 day placebo baseline period, patients were randomized to receive either lisinopril, 5 mg orally once per day (n = 94), or captopril, 12.5 mg orally three times per day (n = 95), in addition to continuation of digoxin and diuretics. The dose of study drug could be doubled at 4 week intervals for a total of 12 weeks of double-blind therapy. The maximal dose was 20 mg once per day of lisinopril or 50 mg three times per day of captopril. The addition of either lisinopril or captopril to a regimen of diuretics or digoxin, or both, caused an increase in exercise duration as assessed on a motorized treadmill. When protocol violators were excluded, patients receiving lisinopril had a statistically greater increase in exercise duration than that of patients receiving captopril. In patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dl at baseline), lisinopril was superior to captopril in improving exercise duration. Lisinopril, but not captopril, increased left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with moderately to severely (less than 35%) decreased function (p less than 0.05). Improvement in functional capacity and quality of life, as assessed by the Yale Scale dyspnea/fatigue index, was significantly greater for the lisinopril group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "382": "To determine whether pharmacological control of blood pressure could affect the renal function and levels of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with renal ablation, and to ascertain the benefits of antihypertensive drugs, we studied effects of oral administration of captopril (50 mg/kg/day), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, benidipine (3 mg/kg/day) and nilvadipine (10 mg/kg/day), newly developed blockers of calcium channel, and indapamide (10 mg/kg/day) for 14 days on systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and plasma ANP concentration in SHR subjected to surgical removal of the left kidney and infarction of two-thirds of the right kidney (5/6 nephrectomy) a week before. Three weeks after the surgery, systolic blood pressure (mmHg) in the untreated group was 253 +/- 9 (n = 10), in the captopril group 156 +/- 9 (n = 7, p less than 0.05), in the benidipine group 197 +/- 9 (n = 7, p less than 0.05), in the nilvadipine group 146 +/- 9 (n = 7, p less than 0.05) and in the indapamide group 206 +/- 5 (n = 7, p less than 0.05). Serum creatinine (mg/100 ml) was lower in the captopril group (0.58 +/- 0.02, n = 7, p less than 0.05) and in the benidipine group (0.50 +/- 0.03, n = 7, p less than 0.05) but not in the nilvadipine group and in the indapamide group 3 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy compared to the untreated group. Blood urea nitrogen was also lower in the captopril group and in the benidipine group but not in the nilvadipine group and in the indapamide group. Plasma ANP concentration was significantly reduced by the treatment with captopril and benidipine but not with nilvadipine and indapamide. These results suggest that the reduction of blood pressure by the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with captopril has the potential to ameliorate renal function of the SHR with remnant kidney, a model of chronic renal failure with hypertension, associated with the decreased concentration of plasma ANP. However, it remains to be determined whether the reduction of blood pressure by calcium channel blockers may be involved in the delayed progression of renal failure in this model since there were disparate effects on renal function and plasma ANP concentration with these two calcium channel blockers.", 
    "383": "1. To determine the response of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in heart failure, seven patients (NYHA Functional Class III-IV) were studied before and after the addition of ramipril to maintenance digoxin and diuretic treatment. 2. Baseline arterial ANP levels were raised, but fell during ramipril treatment in parallel with changes in both haemodynamic recordings (arterial pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and right atrial pressure) and hormone levels (angiotensin II and aldosterone). 3. Coronary sinus ANP, measured in three patients, was greater than concomitant arterial levels, and the coronary sinus ANP secretion rate was calculated to be between 15 and 119 pmol/min. 4. These results demonstrate that improvement in haemodynamic function during ACE inhibitor treatment is associated with a decline in elevated ANP levels, and support the concept that atrial stretch or pressure regulates the secretion of atrial peptides in man.", 
    "384": "Renal artery stenosis is one of the most important forms of secondary hypertension. For years, the only causative treatment was nephrectomy. With rapid advances in cardiovascular and transplantation surgery, operative procedures in renovascular hypertension become more and more sophisticated. Revascularization is superior to medical management of renovascular hypertension in terms of preserved renal function. In recent years, surgical result have been excellent, and even patients with rather complex forms of renovascular hypertension have been successfully operated upon. New classes of antihypertensive drugs, particularly beta-blockers and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors, have enabled the control of blood pressure in most patients with renovascular hypertension but do not assure preservation of renal function. Finally, a fascinating technique, the percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty, has rapidly advanced to become one of the most popular methods in the treatment of hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis. However, percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty is the treatment of choice for most nonostial, nonocclusive lesions.", 
    "385": "The in vivo metabolism of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been studied in the rat after i.v. administration of either [106Phe-14C]- or [126Tyr-125I]-ANP(103-126). Plasma samples containing radioactive peptides were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The major plasma metabolites were [125I]Tyr and [14C]Phe for the iodinated and 14C-labeled peptides, respectively. Both peptides had ANP(104/5-126) as a metabolite. Administration of labeled peptide by either bolus or infusion produced the same metabolite profile. To determine which enzymes were responsible for generating these initial metabolites, animals were first dosed with various protease inhibitors before the infusion of [14C]ANP(103-126). The amino-peptidase inhibitor bestatin and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril caused 54 and 66% increases in plasma ANP(103-126), respectively, but no other effects. Administration of the endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor thiorphan led to a 158% increase of ANP(103-126) in plasma and an 11-fold increase in ANP(104/5-126). The latter metabolite could be selectively decreased by pretreatment with bestatin in combination with thiorphan. The results demonstrate that the initial plasma metabolites of ANP(103-126) are due to the activity of endopeptidase 24.11, a bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, and a carboxypeptidase. The plasma clearance of the peptide is probably also due to cellular binding and uptake in combination with glomerular filtration as very few plasma metabolites were observed even at very high rates of ANP(103-126) infusion.", 
    "386": "Rats with one kidney clamped (2K1C), both kidneys clamped (2K2C), unilaterally nephrectomized with remaining kidney clamped (1K1C), and normals, were studied using 99mTc mercaptoacetyltriglycine ([ 99mTc]MAG-3) and 131I orthoiodohippurate ([131I]OIH). Clearances of [99mTc]MAG-3 and [131I]OIH were performed after constricted rats became hypertensive. Clearances were repeated after i.v. Captopril. Clearances of [99mTc]MAG-3 and [131I]OIH in normals didn't change significantly after Captopril. Clearances of [99mTc]MAG-3 and [131I]OIH decreased insignificantly after Captopril in the 2K2C model. in the 2K1C group, normal kidney clearance increased ([99mTc]MAG-3 p less than 0.01 and [131I]OIH p less than 0.025) and clamped kidney clearance decreased after inhibition ([99mTc]MAG-3, p less than 0.01, [131I]OIH p less than 0.02). Clearances increased in the 1K1C group after Captopril ([99mTc]MAG-3 p less than 0.0025 and [131I]OIH, p less than 0.001). The ratio of [99mTc]MAG-3 to [131I]OIH before Captopril was 0.81 and 0.84 after Captopril. Changes in renal function after Captopril depend on the model of renovascular hypertension and possibly the dose administered. Technetium-99m MAG-3 clearance parallels [131I]orthoiodohippurate in renovascular hypertension.", 
    "387": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) constitute an effective and well tolerated class of drugs for the treatment of arterial hypertension. Yet they have been blamed for the occurrence of side-effects the most frequently reported of which are renal function impairment, hypotension and cough. For this reason, the renal function of hypertensive patients has been evaluated after short - and long - term treatment with perindopril. In patients with normal renal function on short-term treatment (1 and 5 days) perindopril produced an increase of renal plasma flow without change in glomerular filtration. In long-term treatment (up to 18 months), no significant change in plasma creatinine level was observed. In old age hypertensive patients or in patients with chronic renal failure glomerular filtration was also preserved, apart from rare cases of creatinine clearance reduction, notably after addition of hydrochlorothiazide. A very slight and clinically not significant rise of kaliemia was noted when perindopril was used as single-drug treatment. Cases of symptomatic hypotension were rare (0.2 p. 100), even in situations of water and salt depletion. Among the other side-effects of ACEI, cough, which has more recently been described, has carefully been looked for. Its incidence has been determined in a double-blind trial comparing perindopril (1.2 p. 100) with captopril (2.4 p. 100). It has also been evaluated in a long-term study involving 632 hypertensive patients, 391 of whom were treated for 1 year; its incidence then was 2.9 p. 100, and drug withdrawal was required in 8 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In a randomized, double-blind drug versus placebo study involving 34 such patients of mean age 84 years, we observed a 10 p. 100 fall in systolic arterial pressure (p less than 0.01) and a 9 p. 100 fall in diastolic arterial pressure (p less than 0.01) in the perindopril group. The corresponding figures in the placebo group were 5 p. 100 and 4 p. 100 respectively, the difference between the two groups not being significant. The drug was well tolerated, both clinically and biochemically. However, a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in blood potassium level (albeit within normal limits) was observed in the treated group. An open trial conducted in 91 patients (mean age 79.1 years) followed up for 6 years confirmed the acceptability of the drug despite a transient decrease of creatinine clearance recorded in one patient. The effectiveness of perindopril, evaluated less unquestionably in this open trial, was excellent, the hypertension being controlled at the end of treatment in 92.5 p. 100 of the patients. In a trial performed on healthy volunteers, Reid found that perindopril had a greater effect of arterial pressure in elderly subjects, probably due in part to their high blood pressure and to an earlier and more prolonged inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "390": "The effectiveness and acceptability of perindopril (P) as an antihypertensive agent were compared with those of captopril (C), atenolol (A) and a combined hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride diuretic (D) in three simultaneous multicentre double-blind trials involving 165, 173 ans 165 patients respectively. After a 1 month placebo period, 3 groups of patients with essential hypertension whose DAP in supine position ranged from 95 to 125 mmHg (means: 103.9, 106.2 and 105.2 mmHg respectively) were allocated at random to treatment with either P (4 mg once a day) or C (25 mg b.d.) or A (50 mg once a day) or D (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg + amiloride 5 mg once a day) during 3 months. The patients were re-examined monthly and their treatment was modified if their BP was insufficiently controlled (DAP greater than 90 mmHg): first, the dosage of the drug was doubled, then another antihypertensive agent was added, which was either a diuretic (studies with C or A) or a beta-blocker (studies with D). After 3 months, in the monotherapy group BP was controlled in 49 p. 100 of patients on P versus 49 p. 100 on C; 55 p. 100 on P versus 48 p. 100 on A and 72 p. 100 on P versus 72 p. 100 on D. The majority of patients who received P alone were controlled with 4 mg, and only 15 p. 100 required 8 mg. In cases where BP control necessitated a therapeutic combination, the addition of a diuretic was more effective with P than with C (26 p. 100 versus 8 p. 100) or A (23 p. 100 versus 10 p. 100), whereas the addition of a beta-blocker was less effective with P than with D (5 p. 100 versus 13 p. 100). The total percentage of controlled patients was greater with P than with C (75 p. 100 versus 57 p. 100, p = 0.016) or with A (78 p. 100 versus 58 p. 100, p = 0.006); there was non significant difference between P and D (78 p. 100 versus 84 p. 100). The percentages of patients who discontinued treatment were similar with P (6 p. 100 at most), C (4 p. 100), A (5 p. 100) and D (5 p. 100). Most of the side-effects reported with P were minor and unspecific, and their incidence was close to that observed with the other drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "391": "We studied the effect of perindopril, administered during 9 months on the renal function, albuminuria and glycaemic control of diabetic subjects with a mild to moderate hypertension. After 1 month placebo, 40 insulin-treated patients were divided in 3 groups based upon the level of albuminuria. Group I had a normoalbuminuria (less than 15 mg/24 hrs). group II had a pathological microalbuminuria (15-150 mg/24 hrs) and group III had a macroproteinuria (greater than 150 mg/24 hrs). They were given perindopril (4 or 8 mg) once daily. Diastolic blood pressure was normalized within the first 3 months in 80 p. 100 of the patients. From these, 29 (13, 9 and 7 from groups I, II and III, respectively) were followed during a total treatment period of 9 months. They were matched for age, durations of diabetes and hypertension, daily insulin dose, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and quality of glycaemic control. Diastolic blood pressure was decreased by 14 and 17 p. 100 at 1 and 9 months, respectively. Heart rate was not significantly modified. At 3 months, the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme was markedly inhibited while plasma renin activity was increased. In patients of group II, microalbuminuria was reduced from 59 +/- 13 to 32 +/- 6 mg/24 hrs after 1 month and this effect was maintained at 9 months. Despite similar decreases in blood pressure, no significant change of the albuminuria excretion rate was observed in patients of group I or III, respectively. Creatinine clearance remained stable and glycaemic control did not change throughout the study in the 3 groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "392": "The effects of perindopril on the 24-hour arterial pressure levels were evaluated by ambulatory recording in 21 patients (mean age 48 +/- 2 years) with mild to moderate hypertension. At the end of a 3 months treatment with perindopril (4 to 8 mg per day in one dose), comparison by variance analysis of the mean values of arterial pressure over 24 hours before and after treatment showed a significant decrease of SAP (from 144 +/- 3 to 133 +/- 3 mmHg, p less than 0.01) and DAP (from 95 +/- 2 to 87 +/- 2 mmHg, p less than 0.01). The fall in arterial pressures was more pronounced during day-time (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) than at night. Particular attention was paid to the reduction of systolic pressure owing to its relation with arterial compliance. There was a significant correlation between ambulatory recordings of SAP and DAP before and after treatment (r = 0.82 and 0.76 respectively, p less than 0.001). Calculation and comparison of the corresponding regression slope showed that for any given level of DAP, SAP was lower after than before treatment. This effect is related to the increase of arterial compliance observed after treatment with perindopril, as already reported by other authors.", 
    "393": "To evaluate the dose-effect relationship of antihypertensive drugs is essential to a rational determination of their effective dosage. Two double-blind and strictly controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of perindopril 4 mg orally in the treatment of mild to moderate arterial hypertension (100 less than DAP less than 120 mmHg). The drug remained effective 24 hours after the last dose. The 2 mg dose proved insufficient to obtain a significant reduction of blood pressure. In case where the 4 mg dose was not sufficiently active, a better antihypertensive effect could be achieved with an 8 mg dose without major untoward reactions. The antihypertensive activity of perindopril was parallel to the percentage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition induced by the compound. This study also illustrates clearly the value of semi-automatic blood pressure recording with the Dinamap system in the determination of dose-effect relationship, compared with the conventional sphygmomanometric method.", 
    "394": "Perindopril has been studied in groups of normal young and elderly subjects, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and in hypertensive patients. Plasma concentrations of perindoprilat are increased and renal clearance reduced in elderly subjects, resulting in an increase in the acute pharmacodynamic effect of perindopril. Compensated hepatic cirrhosis does not have any independent effect on the pharmacokinetics of perindopril. After intravenous administration, perindoprilat concentrations show multiexponential decay with a terminal half life of over 30 hours associated with sustained inhibition of ACE. During repeated dosing there is little accumulation of drug, and no evidence of increased haemodynamic effect after chronic treatment in hypertensives. The therapeutic consequences of these findings are: binding of perindoprilat to ACE prolongs the haemodynamic effect, giving the option of once daily administration; despite the long terminal elimination half life of the drug, significant accumulation is not a problem during chronic treatment; increased plasma concentrations of active metabolite in the elderly and reduced renal elimination may require reduced doses to be used; further dose adjustment in compensated hepatic cirrhosis is not routinely necessary.", 
    "395": "The effects of renovascular hypertension and of its treatment with perindopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, on the structure and function of large arteries were studied on 2 kidneys, 1 clip Goldblatt rats. One month after surgery, the animals rendered hypertensive (n = 24) and those who had had a blank operation (n = 24) were divided into two groups receiving either perindopril 1 mg/kg/day or distilled water during 4 week At the end of treatment haemodynamic values, including arterial pressure and instant blood flow at Doppler velocimetry, were measured in anaesthesized rats. The mechanical properties of the carotid artery were studied by in situ measurement of carotid compliance in response to imposed pressures. Finally, morphometric parameters of the thoracic aorta, including thickness of the media, density of elastin, collagen and nuclei and nuclear surface area, were studied by means of an automatized image analysis system. Hypertension was associated with a characteristic increase in aortic impedance (14,479 +/- 5,171 vs 9,022 +/- 4,071 dyn.sec/cm5; p less than 0.01) and a decrease in systemic arterial compliance (2.41 +/- 0.96 vs 3.92 +/- 1.15 x 10-3 ml/mmHg; p less than 0.05) and carotid compliance (6.31 +/- 1.85 vs 3.8 +/- 3.4 X 10-2 mm3/mmHg; p less than 0.05). Treatment with perindopril normalized the systolic and diastolic pressures and completely reversed the artery rigidity markers. Our morphometric analysis of the aortic wall enabled us to relate these functional changes to structural changes in vascular wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "396": "This review of the pharmacological effects of perindopril is based on data from the literature and divided into three parts: (i) demonstration of the antihypertensive effect of the drug; (ii) characterization of its inhibitory effect on the angiotensin-converting enzyme, (iii) understanding of its mechanisms of action. The antihypertensive effect of perindopril has been demonstrated in spontaneously hypertensive rats or in artificially induced renovascular hypertension (1 clip-2 kidney, 1 clip-1 kidney). The intensity and duration of this effect is dose-dependent and is increased by stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system (renovascular hypertension, sodium depletion). The peripheral vascular resistance is decreased without corresponding increase in heart rate. The drug-induced vasodilatation predominates in the kidney bed and is associated, in dogs on low water and salt diet, with a rise in natriuresis. These effects are accompanied by inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. In vitro peridoprilate (the main active diacid of perindopril) is a potent (Cl50: 1.5 to 3.2 nM) competitive and relatively specific inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. In vitro, perindopril competitively inhibits the pressive response to angiotensin I. In rats given an oral dose of 1 mg.kg-1 the activity of plasma converting enzyme is inhibited for 24 hours and even longer if they are sodium-deplete. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, the antihypertensive effect of perindopril lasts longer than its inhibitory effect on the plasma converting enzyme. This dissociation suggests that the angiotensin-converting enzyme is inhibited in tissues, as has been shown in various tissues including rat kidney and aorta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "397": "The best antihypertensive regimen for use in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension has not been determined. When nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension fails, initial drug treatment with diuretic drugs, sympatholytic agents (including beta-adrenergic receptor blockers), or vasodilators will result in satisfactory blood pressure control. However, each of these therapies has effects that are independent of their antihypertensive activity and that should be considered before a selection is made for initial therapy. The adverse effects of diuretic agents and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drugs on plasma lipid profiles may diminish the beneficial effects of blood pressure reduction. On the other hand, the hypocholesterolemic effect of alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists, the potential cardioprotective effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and the salutary effects of calcium channel blockers on left ventricular function are responses that would support the use of vasodilatory therapy. Vasodilating antihypertensive drugs may be more beneficial than \"standard\" therapy and should be considered for the initial treatment of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.", 
    "398": "With numerous safe and effective antihypertensive drugs now available, the clinician should no longer choose only diuretic agents or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) as initial therapy. Five classes of agents, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium entry blockers, peripheral alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretic agents, are all appropriate monotherapy in properly selected patients. The choice depends on efficacy, side effects, demography, comorbidity, dosage schedule, cost, mechanism of drug action, and the pathophysiology of the patient's hypertension. Extensive data are now available that will assist the clinician in choosing an agent that has the greatest probability of success without the need for extensive biochemical or hemodynamic evaluation.", 
    "399": "Calcium channel blockers are recently developed antihypertensive drugs. In terms of mechanisms of action, their specificity is not so well established as that of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors but is better understood than that for diuretics or adrenergic-inhibiting drugs. Calcium channel blockers were originally developed for treatment of angina but were found to lower arterial pressure as well. Three of them are now in wide use in the United States; their therapeutic spectrum in regard to type of hypertension is broad. Sublingual nifedipine has replaced intravenously administered vasodilators as immediate treatment of severe hypertension, and all three drugs, given orally, have been shown to be effective in mild, moderate, and severe hypertension. The three drugs available in this country are verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. Pharmacological studies have shown that verapamil has the most negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of the three, with nifedipine producing the most vasodilation and having the potential for causing reflex tachycardia. Actually in practice, these various pharmacological differences have proved to have less significance than previously thought, and the drugs seem to have about equal antihypertensive effectiveness. Comparisons of calcium entry blockers with other drugs have shown them to be equally effective in whites as propranolol but more effective in blacks. Responsiveness appears to be related, as well, to pretreatment plasma renin activity and age. Thus, the antihypertensive effect is directly related to age and inversely related to plasma renin activity. The side effects mostly relate to vasodilation, reflex tachycardia, palpitations, headache, and edema; they are not frequent, and the drugs are well tolerated.", 
    "400": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibiting agents have emerged with the diuretic agents, beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents, and calcium antagonists as therapeutic options for major consideration during the initial treatment of hypertensive patients. These compounds antagonize a potent pressor mechanism underlying hypertensive disease. The ACE inhibitors curtail the generation of the potent octapeptide angiotensin II; in addition, degradation of the potent vasodilator bradykinin is inhibited. Hemodynamically, ACE inhibitors reduce arterial pressure through a decreased total peripheral resistance that is unassociated with reflex stimulation of the heart or expansion of intravascular volume. The arteriolar dilation accounting for the decreased vascular resistance seems to occur in each target organ of the disease. Unlike the direct-acting smooth muscle vasodilators or adrenergic inhibitors, ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent as well as the afferent glomerular arterioles and thereby reduce glomerular hydrostatic pressure and renal filtration fraction, even though renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are preserved. The ACE-inhibiting compounds not only reduce left ventricular afterload in hypertension but also diminish cardiac mass and wall thicknesses. The mechanism(s) for some of these actions have not yet been defined precisely, but they undoubtedly involve the autocrine/paracrine actions of the renopressor system and their effects in the cellular biologic events of vascular smooth muscle and the cardiac myocyte. It seems plausible and exciting that the \"more local\" renin-angiotensin systems will be exploited by those ACE inhibitors yet to be synthesized, which will result in new applications for this class of pharmacological agents.", 
    "401": "Modern antihypertensive therapy is enriched by an explosion in drug development that makes available increasingly specific agents whose effects have advanced our understanding of pressor mechanisms. This and other research into hypertensive mechanisms has defined the clinical, pharmacological, and endocrinologic heterogeneity of human hypertension. The sum of these developments is a greatly enhanced ability to identify curable and definable causes of hypertension and to pathophysiologically stratify the remaining cases of essential hypertension. Modern treatment can be much more specific than before. When long-term drug therapy is indicated, the regimen is more likely to achieve a primary goal for each patient, that is, the fewest possible drugs in the smallest amount and in lowest frequency. Two clinically quantifiable mechanisms for long-term arteriolar vasoconstriction can be identified within the spectrum of human hypertension. The first, renin-mediated vasoconstriction, is directly related to the plasma renin level. The second, sodium-volume-related vasoconstriction, is marked by a reciprocally subnormal renin level and involves abnormal sodium retention and calcium transport. A baseline renin-sodium profile can identify the pressure of one of these two forms of vasoconstriction and therefore is the key for the diagnosis of the two curable disorders that fully express one of the two pressor mechanisms--renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Renovascular hypertension, more common than once thought, is often cured by angioplasty. It is important to diagnose these curable forms before beginning long-term drug therapy. The renin-sodium profile, used in conjunction with serum potassium and creatinine measurements, is valuable not only in screening patients for curable forms, but also for stratifying the remainder according to the pathophysiological vasoconstrictor mechanism that underlies the hypertension. Converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers are, by themselves, often effective in correcting the hypertension of high- or medium-renin patients, whereas calcium antagonists, diuretic agents, or alpha-blockers alone are most effective against the low-renin form of vasoconstriction. In the large midzone of renin values, if monotherapy fails, a rational basis for combined antirenin-antisodium volume therapies can be developed.", 
    "402": "We investigated the impact of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by enalapril (3 X 2.5 mg p.o.) on the renal action of acute intravenous (i.v.) infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide (1-28-hANP 0.1 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min) in 10 normal subjects. During the control infusion of ANP, urinary sodium excretion rose from 4.5 +/- 0.8 to 11.2 +/- 2.2 mEq/min and urine volume from 32 +/- 14 to 115 +/- 34 ml/30 min. This increment in urinary volume and sodium output during ANP infusion was almost completely reduced by ACE inhibition. ANP plasma levels before and during the infusion and stimulation of urinary cGMP excretion were unaltered by ACE inhibition. However, enalapril treatment reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 112 +/- 3 to 106 +/- 3 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 71 +/- 2 to 66 +/- 3 mm Hg. The small rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during the control infusion of ANP was not observed after pretreatment with enalapril. The study demonstrates the importance of the renin-angiotensin system for the natriuretic and diuretic action of ANP in normal humans.", 
    "403": "In anesthetized dogs, a 15-min intravenous (i.v.) infusion of fenoldopam (2.0 micrograms/kg/min) produced a decrease in mean aortic blood pressure (MAP) and an increase in renal blood flow (RBF) and plasma renin activity (PRA). The hypotensive effect attained a maximum within 5 min and then waned by approximately 30% at the end of fenoldopam administration. The development of this \"tolerance\" phenomenon was prevented by enalapril or saralasin. The hypotension and the increase in PRA were not modified by either propranolol or chlorisondamine but were inhibited by SCH 23390, a DA1 antagonist. Fenoldopam (0.1 microgram/kg/min for 15 min) infused into the left renal artery (i.a.) in intact or ganglion-blocked dogs did not change MAP but increased PRA. This effect was antagonized by SCH 23390. In ganglion-blocked preparations in which an apparently maximal renal vasodilatation had been achieved by an i.a. acetylcholine, i.a. fenoldopam produced an increase in PRA which was again blocked by SCH 23390. In uninephrectomized dogs, blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors or inhibition of renal baroreceptor and macula densa mechanisms of renin release failed to prevent the fenoldopam-induced increase in PRA. In conclusion, the release of renin by fenoldopam is responsible for the development of tolerance to the hypotensive effects of fenoldopam. Furthermore, because the increase in PRA was blocked by SCH 23390 and occurred in the absence of either operational systemic or intrarenal regulatory mechanisms, we propose that it is mediated by stimulation of specific dopamine (DA1) receptors on the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells.", 
    "404": "The hemodynamic and myocardial effects of chronic treatment (5 months) with converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI, enalapril, group T1, n = 10) or a beta 1 blocker (atenolol, group T2, n = 13) of normotensive mature male Wistar rats were studied and compared to untreated younger rats (group C0, 11 months old, n = 14) and to untreated age-matched controls (group C1, 16 months old, n = 14). Heart rate was significantly decreased in T2 rats but unchanged in the T1 group. There was a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure (BP) in both treated groups (systolic T1:90 +/- 17, T2: 87 +/- 10, vs. C1: 102 +/- 11 mm Hg, and diastolic T1: 60 +/- 17, T2: 59 +/- 9, vs. C1: 73 +/- 13 mm Hg). Cardiac output was unchanged by therapy but stroke volume was significantly increased in the T2 group (0.24 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.04 cm3 in C1). Total peripheral resistance was significantly decreased in T1 and T2 groups. Left ventricular weight to body weight ratio (LVW/BW) was significantly decreased in T1 (1.74 +/- 0.11 vs. 2.02 +/- 0.22 in C1) but unchanged in T2 (1.90 +/- 0.15 vs. 2.02 +/- 0.22). The left ventricular passive pressure-volume curve was significantly rightward shifted by beta-blocker therapy (T2) but unchanged by CEI (T1). This corresponds to a decrease of chamber stiffness k in the T2 group compared to C1 and T1 groups. A significant fibrosis was seen in group T2 (mean collagen fiber thickness of 3.03 +/- 0.24 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.15 micron) but not in the T1 group (2.94 +/- 0.14 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.15 micron). Thus, despite the similar decrease in BP induced by the CEI and the beta blocker, the cardiac effects of the two drugs were opposite: CEI decreased LVW/BW with no change in the left ventricular pressure-volume curve and myocardial fibrosis whereas beta blocker did not change the LVW/BW, but induced a left ventricular dilation associated with a decrease in chamber stiffness and an increase in subendocardial fibrosis.", 
    "405": "Forty patients, mean age 56.87 yrs. with light or moderate essential arterial hypertension were randomized double-blind into two subgroups of 20 subjects each, and submitted to daily combined drug treatment with either captopril 50 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (group A) or amiloride 5 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg (group B). Patients were monitored after the washout period and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment approximately 20-24 after the last dose. The following parameters were studied: blood pressure, heart rate, body weight, untoward side effects. Standard laboratory tests were performed in all patients after washout and at the end of the 8-week treatment period. Both combinations significantly reduced pressure values but the captopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination reduced blood pressure more readily and proved more effective in reducing diastolic values. There were no dropouts due to subjective side effects which were of little relevance and were equally distributed among the two groups. As for laboratory data, patients taking the captopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination had a statistically significant increase in blood glucose. Neither combination induced significant changes in the other parameters, especially as far as potassemia was concerned.", 
    "406": "The calcium antagonists are effective and safe agents for the treatment of arterial hypertension. They are well tolerated by the patients. In contrast to other types of antihypertensive agents, they cause few metabolic disturbances. They can be combined with diuretics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. They can be safely prescribed to patients with hypertension and concomitant diseases such as diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure, gout, renal failure, peripheral atherosclerotic disease, or Raynaud's phenomenon. Dietary sodium restriction during antihypertensive therapy with calcium antagonists is not required for optimal antihypertensive efficacy. The second generation of calcium antagonists especially the dihydropyridine analogues that have greater potency and vascular selectivity, and a longer duration of action, will optimize the treatment of hypertension. Their antiatherosclerotic, antiplatelet, and \"antitrophic\" effects in experimental models for atherogenesis and hypertension hold great promise for the future since, so far, there has been no major success in reducing the incidence of coronary death by the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "407": "Conventional stepped-care approaches for the control of high blood pressure based on the use of diuretics and beta-blockers have had a disappointing impact on coronary heart disease, the major cause of death in hypertension. Drug therapy for blood pressure should be complementary to attempts to control other risk factors and should not adversely affect other factors. A range of drugs, including calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and alpha-blockers, can be considered as possible first-line treatment. The choice of drug therapy should be individualized and the minimal number of drugs used in the simplest rational regimen. Simple demographic factors and associated diseases, risk factors, and activities should be used to select the most appropriate agents. New combinations offer alternatives for patients who do not receive adequate control with monotherapy.", 
    "408": "The effects of combined treatment with the calcium antagonist isradipine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial comprising 28 patients with essential hypertension. The average age was 50 years (range, 31 to 65 years). After all patients were given captopril 50 mg twice daily plus placebo for four weeks, they were randomly assigned into groups receiving in addition either placebo or isradipine 1.25 mg twice daily in increasing doses at four-week intervals. During Weeks 20 to 24, the captopril plus placebo group was given hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg per day. Blood pressure was measured in the morning, 12 hours after tablet intake. Supine blood pressure was reduced in the captopril plus isradipine group by -8/-6, -14/-9, -16/-8, and -11/-7 mm Hg compared with the placebo group. Changes in diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant at Week 8, whereas changes in systolic blood pressure were statistically significant at Weeks 12, 16, and 20. With the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (Weeks 20 to 24), only supine systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced. One patient was withdrawn from the trial due to a rash. The results indicate that combined treatment with a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is effective in lowering blood pressure and that the combination is well tolerated during long-term therapy. The combination of captopril and isradipine was more effective than captopril given with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "409": "We investigated the influences of captopril (CAP) and hydralazine (HYD) on the ANP mRNA level in the hypertrophied left ventricle (LV) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHRs (16 weeks of age) were given CAP (35 mg/kg/day) or HYD (3.5 mg/kg/day) for two weeks. Both drugs reduced blood pressure by a similar magnitude. Treatment with CAP caused a reduction in the ANP mRNA level in LV by 62%, and a reduction in the weight of the LV. The ANP mRNA level in LV of the HYD-treated rats was also decreased, but only by 31%. HYD did not affect LV hypertrophy. ANP gene expression in LV of SHR might be effectively suppressed by a reduction of blood pressure and also by the concomitant attenuation of hypertrophy.", 
    "410": "A material of 76 patients from general practice treated with diuretics for mild to moderate hypertension were randomized to supplementary treatment with captopril (39 patients) and metoprolol (37 patients), respectively, on account of diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg. Satisfactory regulation of the blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg) and acceptable wellbeing was obtained in 29 patients in the captopril group and in 23 patients in the metoprolol group. Six patients in the captopril group were excluded on account of absence of effect on the blood pressure and four dropped out on account of side effects. In the metoprolol group, nine patients were excluded on account of absence of effect on the blood pressure and five on account of side effects. This difference was not significant. In the captopril group, 14 side effects were registered in eight patients while 23 side effects were observed in 15 patients in the metoprolol group. This difference was not statistically significant, p greater than 0.05 (risk for type 2 error = 60%). It is concluded that captopril + a diuretic is just as effective a form of treatment of slight to moderate hypertension as metoprolol + a diuretic and that treatment with captopril + a diuretic is associated with so few side effects that it may be considered as an alternative first choice of treatment in cases of slight to moderate hypertension.", 
    "411": "Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, which are promising therapeutic agents with few side effects, have measurably improved the management of many patients with primary or secondary hypertension and those with heart failure. This paper briefly reviews the emerging evidence for the potential risk associated with long-term inhibition of the renin system. The current lack of methodology for quantification of renin-angiotensin inhibition in various tissues, however, precludes firm conclusions. Preliminary evidence suggests that in functional terms, a downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system, if therapeutically successful, is safer than aggressive and longer-lasting inhibition. It has been questioned whether antihypertensive therapy 'normalizes' the structural cardiovascular changes and whether interference with the initial adaptive phase may prove detrimental. However, no specific role for renin inhibition, apart from the antihypertensive effect, has yet been defined.", 
    "412": "The intrasubject and intersubject variabilities for CGS 16617, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were evaluated in an open-label, repeat single-dose bioavailability trial. Eight healthy male volunteers each received a 20-mg oral dose of CGS 16617 as an aqueous solution on four separate occasions. Components of variance were evaluated for a mixed-effects statistical model in which subjects were regarded as a random factor. While intersubject variability was statistically significant (P less than 0.05) for all pharmacokinetic variables measured, AUC, Cmax, t1/2, and tmax, its contribution to the total observed variability was relatively small for AUC, t1/2, and tmax. The proportion of variation due to intrasubject variability was 70, 19, 61, and 72% for AUC, Cmax, t1/2, and tmax, respectively. Ramifications of the large intrasubject source component of variability as related to bioavailability trials and biological variation are discussed.", 
    "413": "318 consultant physicians in Scotland were sent a questionnaire on their use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to treat chronic heart failure (CHF). 229 (72%) replies were received. Of these 91% used ACE inhibitors for CHF; 22% were geriatricians, 58% general physicians and 20% cardiologists. All groups reserved ACE inhibitors for patients uncontrolled by diuretics alone. Compared to general physicians, cardiologists used ACE inhibitors in preference to other vasodilators and digoxin, used higher doses and commenced treatment more often on a day-patient basis. Cardiologists also commonly started treatment with captopril even if continuing with enalapril. Geriatricians used ACE inhibitors as frequently as cardiologists but at lower doses; they did not report side-effects more frequently. Further investigation of the safety and possible cost savings of supervised day-patient rather than in-patient, introduction of ACE inhibitors for CHF is now merited. To avoid an extended period of patient observation after the first dose of ACE inhibitor, captopril might also be given as the initial therapy, even if continuing with enalapril. This policy would also reduce the risk of any hypotensive response being prolonged.", 
    "414": "Seven ACE inhibitors were studied for possible differences in distribution to aorta, brain, heart, lung, and kidney after administration of single oral doses to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Doses, normalized for differences in inhibitory potency and molecular weight, were expected to deliver equivalent levels of ACE-inhibitory activity to the circulation, and this was confirmed by preliminary dose-response studies. The relative potencies of the active moieties of the seven drugs and the normalized oral doses used were: SQ 29,852 (1.0), 100 mg/kg; captopril (3.5), 30 mg/kg; enalapril (12), 20 mg/kg; fosinopril (13), 25 mg/kg; zofenopril (20), 10 mg/kg; lisinopril (24), 10 mg/kg; and ramipril (51), 5 mg/kg. In these ex vivo studies, ACE activities were determined fluorometrically in SHR sera and in uncentrifuged homogenates of the solid tissues at various times after oral dosing with the ACE inhibitors. As expected, the normalized oral doses of the seven inhibitors had equivalent effects on serum ACE. In lung, where ACE has a vascular endothelial localization, and in aorta, where ACE inhibition correlates with antihypertensive action, ramipril, lisinopril, and zofenopril were distinguished by the magnitude and duration (three to four days) of their effects. In the brain, where ACE may affect central regulation of blood pressure and participate in the degradation of certain neuropeptides, ramipril and enalapril had no effect; captopril and zofenopril had modest, short-lasting effects, and fosinopril, lisinopril, and SQ 29,852 had delayed but long-lasting inhibitory actions. In the kidney, where ACE inhibition may have positive or negative effects on renal function, ramipril and fosinopril could be distinguished by their weak actions, perhaps associated with biliary routes of excretion. In the heart, where ACE inhibitors may prevent ischemic damage to the myocardium, single oral doses of captopril, fosinopril, and particularly zofenopril produced striking and long-lasting inhibition, whereas equivalent doses of ramipril and enalapril produced barely detectable inhibition.", 
    "415": "A two-part hemodynamic trial of the efficacy and safety of quinapril hydrochloride was conducted in 26 patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) who had not optimally responded to treatment with diuretics and digitalis. A total of 25 patients had evaluable data after receiving single doses (2.5, 5, or 10 mg) of quinapril. Following acute dosing, favorable hemodynamic changes began within thirty minutes to one hour and usually reached a maximum within four hours post-dose. Nineteen evaluable patients who had responded to acute therapy received an additional sixteen weeks of chronic treatment with quinapril in individualized dosage regimens. Hemodynamic responses did not differ markedly between acute and chronic therapy. Favorable hemodynamic responses were maintained or enhanced following chronic doses of 5 to 30 mg/day (given either once daily or in divided doses). The most frequent doses were 10-15 mg/day in divided doses. The mean maximum percent changes in four primary hemodynamic parameters after chronic dosing (compared with baseline) were: mean arterial blood pressure, -3.9%; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, -39.7%; cardiac output, +31.7%; and systemic vascular resistance, -25.2%. Changes in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure did not result in clinically significant bradycardia or hypotention. Overall, quinapril produced both acute and sustained beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients whose congestive heart failure was not clinically controlled with diuretics and digitalis.", 
    "416": "Quinapril (Q) and quinaprilat (QT) pharmacokinetics are dose proportional following single oral 2.5- to 80-mg Q doses. Q absorption and hydrolysis to QT is rapid with peak Q and QT concentrations occurring one and two hours postdose, respectively. Peak plasma QT concentrations were approximately fourfold higher than those of Q (923 vs 207 ng/mL following 40-mg Q). Dose-proportional QT area under the curve and dose-independent percent of dose excreted in urine as QT demonstrate that the extent of Q conversion to QT is constant over the dose range studied. Q and QT were eliminated from plasma with apparent half-lives of 0.8 and 1.9 hours and apparent plasma clearances of 1,850 and 220 mL/min, respectively, over the 2.5- to 80-mg dose range. Following oral 14C-Q, 61% and 37% of radiolabel was recovered in urine and feces, respectively. Q plus QT accounted for 46% of radioactivity circulating in plasma and 56% of that excreted in urine. Metabolism to compounds other than QT is not extensive. Two diketopiperazine metabolites of Q have been identified in plasma and urine, with approximately 6% of an administered dose excreted in urine as each of these metabolites. Peak plasma concentrations of these metabolites are similar to that of Q, and each is eliminated rapidly with a half-life of approximately one hour. Urinary excretion profiles indicate the presence of other minor metabolites. In summary, the absorption of Q and conversion to QT is rapid and dose-proportional, subsequent clearance of both Q and QT is independent of dose, and metabolism to compounds other than QT is not extensive.", 
    "417": "In 12 patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), captopril in doses of 25 to 150 mg, every 8 hours, was given for a period of 2 months, in addition to cardiac glycoside and diuretic drugs. After this treatment left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (EDD) decreased from 6.4 +/- 0.5 to 6.2 +/- 0.6 cm (p less than 0.05), left-ventricular end-systolic diameter (ESD) decreased from 5.7 +/- 0.5 to 5.4 +/- 0.6 cm (p less than 0.001), the ejection fraction increased from 30.8 +/- 7.0 to 36.2 +/- 6.9% (p less than 0.005) and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcf) increased from 0.51 +/- 0.12 to 0.62 +/- 0.13 circ/sec (p less than 0.001). Captopril markedly relieved dyspnea and fatigue. Three patients improved from class IV to class III, 4 patients from class IV to class II and 3 patients from class III to class II. These data suggest that captopril may be effective in the treatment of severe chronic CHF.", 
    "418": "The presence of R-A-A system components in all organs (heart included) has suggested a possible cardio-protective effect of the angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors as a result of coronary flow improvement. This effect would act irrespective of the well-known peripheral vascular effects: vasodilation, blood pressure decrease, pre- and postload reduction. By using the atrial pacing in the quantitative assessment of the anginal threshold and of the associated ECG alterations before and after the i.v. administration of 25 mg of captopril we could immediately evaluate the coronary reserves by estimating the efficiency of captopril in the patients with angina pectoris. The atrial pacing has been performed, by using the method suggested by Sowton, in 18 patients with typical angina. The increase of heart tolerance at exercise, the systolic dynamics improvement and the ejection fraction increase as well as the raising of the anginal threshold have been noticed in 15 of the patients. The blood pressure has evidenced no significant changes. After the administration of captopril, the ischemic ECG alterations have been less marked and their postpacing remains shorter. Our findings plead for a direct action of captopril on cardiac intrinsic R-A-A system in the normotensive patients suffering from angina pectoris.", 
    "419": "In this double blind study we have evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the association Captopril 50 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 15 mg/die vs hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/die in aged patients with hypertension. Both drugs showed a good antihypertensive efficacy, and a better efficacy on diastolic blood pressure was shown by the association Captopril + hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "420": "Thirty hypertensive diabetic patients were randomly, double blindly, treated with Captopril (CPT) 50 mg + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 15 mg (No 19) or HCTZ 25 mg alone (No 11) for 3 months, to assess blood pressure control and some metabolic modifications. The results indicate that CPT + a low dose of HCTZ maintains the synergistic effect of the two drugs, minimizing the metabolic problems related to HCTZ in hypertensive diabetic patients.", 
    "421": "The 1.5-benzotthazepine derivative diltiazem, which blocks slow calcium channels, is an effective hypotensive agent, used for the treatment of moderate hypertension. Treatment with diltiazem alone, its dose adjusted on an individual basis, controlled arterial blood pressure in 58% of the patients. With a 240 mg daily dose, blood pressure was controlled in 12 of 52 patients; when the daily dose was increased to 360 mg, blood pressure was controlled in another 18 patients. In the remaining 22 patients, blood pressure was only controlled after captopril was added in a daily dose of at least 50 mg. The drop of arterial blood pressure was associated with falling total peripheral resistance and end diastolic blood volume, and was accompanied by an increase in left-ventricular ejection fraction and myocardial oxygen want.", 
    "422": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. They are potent drugs and have few side effects. The search for potent and orally absorbable agents that either block the angiotensin II receptor or inhibit the catalytic action of renin has not been so successful. This paper reviews present efforts to develop renin inhibitors. Most of the work has been based on the design of peptide analogues of angiotensinogen, many of which contain the unusual amino acid statine (or one of its variants) in place of the scissile bond (the peptide bond that renin cleaves in angiotensinogen). Substitutions at other sites in the molecule determine potency and species selectivity; for example, substitutions at the carboxyl terminus permit the construction of potent renin inhibitors that contain fewer amino acid residues. Peptide analogues of the prorenin segment of the enzyme, however, are but weak inhibitors and show little promise. Progress has also been slow in efforts to understand the principles required in the synthesis of potent renin inhibitors with significant bioavailability after oral administration. Finally, the question of whether renin inhibitors will offer a clinical advantage over converting enzyme inhibitors has not been answered.", 
    "423": "Over a period of several years, methods of measuring circulating angiotensin II have been progressively improved and it has now become possible to measure circulating angiotensin II with a high degree of accuracy. The main ingredients in this new methodology are bonded-phase silica for quantitative angiotensin extraction from biological fluids and antibodies with a high affinity to angiotensin II to provide for the sensitivity of the radio-immunoassay, high performance liquid chromatography to guarantee the specificity for the angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide, and a renin inhibitor in the blood sampling tube to prevent any in vitro angiotensin II generation. With this new methodology it can be demonstrated that after the first administration of a full dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, plasma angiotensin II virtually disappears from the circulation, whereas with chronic administration which induces a marked increase in renin secretion and thereby in angiotensin I levels, angiotensin II clearly remains present in plasma at peak inhibition, though at a much lower level than before ACE inhibition. Plasma angiotensin II levels were decreased equally and dose-dependently by the administration of two renin inhibitors, CGP 38560A and A64662. However, in man these compounds have so far only been tested with single administration. In conclusion, the measurement of plasma angiotensin II equally reflects the degree of ACE and renin inhibition, and is therefore the only logical approach to evaluation of the efficacy and potency of ACE inhibitors and renin antagonists.", 
    "424": "The renin inhibitor H77 and the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril were compared in separate experiments with infusion of 5% dextrose as a control for the effects on plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration, arterial pressure and cardiac function, measured by Swan-Ganz catheter, in conscious dogs. The effects of a high dose of H77 (10 mg/kg per h) were similar to those of high-dose captopril (6 mg/kg per h). Both reduced plasma Ang II concentration, systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure; both increased the heart rate; both increased cardiac output but the change was significant only with captopril; neither affected stroke volume, pulmonary artery pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance; both reduced left and right atrial pressures. The similar pattern of effects for the two inhibitors suggests that the mechanism by which they act is the same--reduction in Ang II--and that the cardiovascular effects of H77 are not a specific action of the peptide that is unrelated to the reduction in plasma Ang II concentrations.", 
    "425": "Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was 100 +/- 4 mmHg in a group (n = 3) of conscious sodium-deficient dogs. A 3-day infusion of the renin inhibitor isovaleryl -His-Pro-Phe-His-Sta-Leu-Phe-NH2 (SCRIP) lowered MAP to an average of 79 +/- 4 mmHg. Termination of the infusion resulted in a prompt rise in MAP to 100 +/- 5 mmHg but plasma renin activity (PRA), which was 22 +/- 2 ng angiotensin (Ang) l/ml per h before the infusion, recovered only to 5 +/- 1 ng Ang l/ml per h during the same time (4 h after infusion). In other experiments in sodium-deficient dogs, a direct comparison was made between inhibition of PRA and the reduction of blood pressure. Over the dose range 0.1-2 micrograms/kg per min, PRA was inhibited in a dose-related manner, but MAP was not reduced. At dose levels beginning an order of magnitude higher (e.g. 20-160 g/kg per min), PRA was completely inhibited and there was a dose-related fall in MAP. These data suggest that there is no correlation between inhibition of PRA and the reduction in blood pressure in chronically sodium-deficient dogs. In other studies comparing renin inhibition with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, there was evidence for greater efficacy of ACE inhibition in conscious sodium-deficient dogs, but no evidence of any difference in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive dogs.", 
    "426": "The cardiovascular actions of a renin inhibitor, U-71038 (Boc-Pro-Phe-N-MeHis-Leu psi [CHOHCH2]Val-Ile-Amp), and of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, were determined in conscious sodium-depleted cynomolgus monkeys. Cardiac output was measured with a thermodilution technique. The hypotension induced by U-71038 was associated with a significant reduction in total peripheral resistance without alteration in cardiac output or the heart rate. A similar reduction in total peripheral resistance was observed after captopril at a dose which caused hypotension equivalent to that elicited by U-71038. The latter effects were not accompanied by significant alterations in cardiac output or the heart rate. The glomerular filtration rate was measured by the plasma disappearance of 125I-sodium iothalamate. Renin or ACE inhibition adequate to cause equivalent hypotensive responses did not change the glomerular filtration rate to a significantly different degree. The systemic and renal haemodynamic profiles of U-71038 and captopril appear to be similar, suggesting that renin and ACE inhibition elicit fundamentally similar cardiovascular effects in conscious sodium-depleted cynomolgus monkeys via a decreased formation of angiotensin II (Ang II).", 
    "427": "The effects of the renin inhibitor, SR 43845 (IC50 = 10(-11) mol/l human and primate plasma renin) and of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on blood pressure and plasma active renin were investigated in conscious, chronically instrumented, sodium-replete macaca (cynomolgus monkeys). Perfusion of SR 43845 at 0.33, 3.3, 33, 100 and 200 micrograms/kg per min for 30 min elicited a dose-related decrease in blood pressure with a notable effect on plasma renin activity (PRA; 90% inhibition), beginning at a dose of 0.33 micrograms/kg per min. The maximal reduction in blood pressure of 22 +/- 2 mmHg (from 110 +/- 5 mmHg) was achieved at 100 micrograms/kg per min and a higher dose (200 micrograms/kg per min) induced no further reduction. Plasma levels of active renin were also significantly increased (to 104%, from 102 +/- 14 pg/ml) at the lower dose. Captopril, tested at 33 micrograms/kg per min under the same experimental conditions, lowered blood pressure in a similar manner and with the same intensity as the renin inhibitor at an equal dose (by 14 +/- 1 mmHg, from 114 +/- 4 mmHg). However, a dose six times as high only influenced the decrease of blood pressure slightly (by 16 +/- 2 mmHg, from 103 +/- 5 mmHg). For the same hypotensive effect, the plasma renin concentration was significantly higher with the renin than with the ACE inhibitor. The recovery of pre-infusion blood pressure was both time- and dose-dependent, the basal value being almost restored after 5 h with both inhibitors, although the initial plasma renin levels were not completely recovered. A comparison of the maximal hypotensive effects and the plasma active renin concentrations elicited by the renin and the ACE inhibitors suggests that there are no major differences between the two types of inhibition and that renin inhibition is slightly more efficient.", 
    "428": "The effect of renin inhibitor ES-1005 on renin gene expression was investigated in sodium-depleted marmosets. The kidneys were removed after continuous infusion of ES-1005 (12 mg/kg per h) for 2 h. The relative amount of kidney renin messenger (m)RNA was measured by densitometric Northern blot analysis using an alpha-32P-labelled human renin complementary (c)DNA fragment as a hybridization probe. Plasma renin activity was completely inhibited by ES-1005. The level of kidney renin mRNA decreased significantly to about one-third of the normal control value. We also investigated the inhibitory potency of the renin inhibitor ES-6864 on the renin-like activity in dog tissues (adrenal glands, aorta and brainstem). ES-6864 inhibited the tissue renin-like activity with an IC50 of 10(-7) to 10(-8) mol/l in vitro. Renin inhibitors not only inhibit the activity of plasma and tissue renin, but also suppress the synthesis of renin in the kidney.", 
    "429": "The effects of bilateral electrolytic lesions of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were examined in 8 rats at one and 5 days after placement of the lesions. The MAP (111 +/- 2 mm Hg) and HR (393 +/- 17 bpm) of the lesion group were similar to the values recorded in the control group (117 +/- 3 mm Hg, 405 +/- 11 bpm; n = 18). Blockade of the synthesis of angiotensin II with captopril in the lesion group significantly decreased MAP to 93 +/- 2 mm Hg on the first postlesion day. In contrast, the MAP of the control group after captopril fell slightly to 111 +/- 4 mm Hg. Captopril did not alter MAP or HR on postlesion day 5 in either group. Administration of chlorisondamine, an autonomic ganglionic blocking agent, reduced MAP in the lesion and control groups to similar values of 59 +/- 2 mm Hg and 64 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. Baroreflex-mediated tachycardia to a decrease in MAP was abolished in the lesion group at one day postlesion and attenuated at 5 days postlesion. In contrast, the baroreflex-mediated bradycardia to an increase in MAP was unaffected by the lesions. Plasma renin activity (PRA) in the lesion group was elevated by nearly 50% as compared to the control group on the first postlesion day (7.3 +/- 0.8 and 4.9 +/- 0.5 ng AI/ml/h, respectively). A 90% elevation in plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration was also observed in the lesion group as compared to the control group (437 +/- 80 pg/ml and 228 +/- 22 pg/ml, respectively) on postlesion day one. By postlesion day 5, the PRA of the lesion and control groups were nearly identical (4.4 +/- 0.7 and 4.0 +/- 1.0 ng AI/ml/h, respectively), and the plasma NE concentrations were also very similar (201 +/- 41 pg/ml and 175 +/- 22 pg/ml, respectively). We conclude that bilateral destruction of the RVLM does not cause hypotension or bradycardia in conscious rats. Therefore, areas other than the RVLM are capable of maintaining MAP and HR. Sympathetic vasomotor and cardiomotor tone appears unaffected by the lesions. However, increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system may contribute transiently to the maintenance of vasomotor tone and, consequently, MAP after lesion of the RVLM. The RVLM may be important in mediating baroreflex increase in HR.", 
    "430": "Of various antihypertensive drugs, particularly the unselective as well as the selective beta-receptor blockers but also diuretic drugs unfavourable effects on the lipid metabolism are reported, which above all consist of increases of triglycerides and decreases of HDL-cholesterol. The more modern antihypertensive drugs such as calcium antagonists, alpha 1-receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors according to the hitherto existing studies have no significant influence on the serum lipids. The final classification of the antihypertensive drugs regarding their influence on the atherogenic risk by negative changes in the lipoprotein metabolism is, however, at present not yet possible on account of insufficient long-term studies. For the reduction of adequate endangerings dietetic measures, reduction of overweight, physical training and when occasion arises change of the medication are recommended.", 
    "431": "Twelve well-controlled, type II diabetic patients without hypertension and advanced diabetic complications and 12 age-matched healthy control subjects were treated for 4 days with captopril 25 mg three times daily. The pretreatment values of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, urinary 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 were similar in both groups. Urinary prostaglandin E2 was significantly reduced in diabetics. After captopril plasma renin activity increased significantly in the diabetics and control subjects. Plasma aldosterone was not significantly decreased in both groups. Urinary prostaglandin E2 increased significantly in both diabetic and control groups. Other measured prostaglandins remained unchanged. After captopril systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in diabetics and not significantly in the control group. The results indicate that captopril was an effective drug for lowering blood pressure in diabetic patients, too. It is possible that the antihypertensive effect of captopril in diabetics could be due at least partly to prostaglandin E2.", 
    "432": "To establish the role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in the management of hypertension in the elderly, 16 patients were treated with captopril in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study. Clinic blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure, renal function and mental performance, with emphasis on mood and psychological well-being, were assessed. Twelve patients, aged 73 (+/- 4.4) years, completed the study. The doses of captopril used were 50 mg (11 patients) and 25 mg (one patient) twice daily for 4 weeks. Mean (+/- s.e.m.) clinic sitting blood pressure during captopril therapy was significantly lower than during administration of placebo (172 +/- 4.5/83 +/- 25 versus 188 +/- 4.4/89 +/- 3.4 mmHg; P less than 0.001/P less than 0.05). Mean ambulatory blood pressure was also significantly lower on captopril treatment than during administration of placebo (166 +/- 5.3/87 +/- 1.6 versus 179 +/- 5.1/94 +/- 2.4 mmHg; P less than 0.02/P less than 0.02) and this effect was sustained over the dosing interval. Renal blood flow and mental performance were unaltered by treatment. Gastrointestinal discomfort occurred in two patients, one of whom was withdrawn and cough developed in one patient. We conclude that captopril is effective as monotherapy in lowering blood pressure in the elderly.", 
    "433": "In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study in 23 diabetic patients, insulin treated (N = 11) or noninsulin treated (N = 12), with mild to moderate hypertension, the hypotensive effects of captopril and atenolol were compared. Five patients had overt diabetic nephropathy. All patients received 50 mg twice daily of either drug. Treatment periods lasted 6 weeks and were preceded and separated by a placebo period. Two patients dropped out, one because of intermittent claudication during atenolol, one with cardiac arrhythmia during placebo. Blood pressure was reduced from 165 +/- 5/96 +/- 1 to 154 +/- 5/89 +/- 2 mmHg (mean +/- SEM: P less than 0.01) during captopril and from 171 +/- 5/98 +/- 1 to 159 +/- 6/89 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01) during atenolol. These antihypertensive effects are not significantly different. There was a wide inter- and intraindividual variation in hypotensive response to both drugs, which may have important consequences for treatment strategies. No consistent differences between insulin and noninsulin treated patients were seen. Parameters of glycemic control did not change during any therapy, neither in insulin treated nor in non-insulin treated patients. Albuminuria and renal function did not change. During captopril treatment one patient complained of a non-productive cough. Two patients experienced a severe hypoglycemic reaction during atenolol. No other major side-effects were seen. In conclusion, this study showed equal hypotensive effectivity of 100 mg captopril and 100 mg atenolol daily in hypertensive diabetics, without evident effect on glycemic control.", 
    "434": "Vasomotor disregulation, preponderantly expressed by a pathological increase of central venous pressure (CVP) in calves with total artificial heart (TAH), starts to be evident from about the 50th day of pumping. The main cause of this state is an imbalance in cardiac receptor areas. Ventricular vasodepressor mechanisms are eliminated with the ventricular tissue, which is replaced by the artificial blood pump. In the stumps of both atria, which remain in situ, all neural elements disappear immediately after TAH implantation, but within two months they are fully regenerated. Regenerated atrial receptors are the starting points of afferent neural stimuli, which in the vasomotor center of the brainstem, increase the activity of the vasoconstricting functional component. A general tendency to vasoconstriction, now not well counterbalanced, increases, and the progressive venous hypertension causes loss of liver function and morphology. Two therapeutic approaches were tried: afferent therapy by atrial electrical stimulation, and efferent therapy by the administration of antihypertensives. Both kinds of this therapy were sufficiently effective in reducing CVP, protecting the liver, and prolonging average survival.", 
    "435": "A comprehensive survey of 11 peptidases, all of which are markers for renal microvillar membranes, has been made in membrane fractions prepared from pig choroid plexus. Two fractionation schemes were explored, both depending on a MgCl2-precipitation step, the preferred one having advantages in speed and yield of the activities. The specific activities of the peptidases in the choroid-plexus membranes were, with the exception of carboxypeptidase M, lower than in renal microvillar membranes: those of aminopeptidase N, peptidyl dipeptidase A ('angiotensin-converting enzyme') and gamma-glutamyltransferase were 3-5-fold lower, those of aminopeptidase A and endopeptidase-24.11 were 12-15 fold lower, and those of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and aminopeptidase W were 50-70-fold lower. Carboxypeptidase M had a similar activity in both membranes. Alkaline phosphatase and (Na+ + K+)-activated ATPase were more active in the choroid-plexus membranes. No activity for microsomal dipeptidase, aminopeptidase P and carboxypeptidase P could be detected. Six of the peptidases and (Na+ + K+)-activated ATPase were also studied by immunoperoxidase histochemistry at light- and electron-microscopic levels. Endopeptidase-24.11 and (Na+ + K+)-activated ATPase were uniquely located on the brush border, and the other two peptidases appeared to be much more abundant on the endothelial lining of microvessels. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV and aminopeptidase W were also detected in microvasculature. Pial membranes associated with the brain and spinal cord also stained positively for endopeptidase-24.11, aminopeptidase N and peptidyl dipeptidase A. The immunohistochemical studies indicated the subcellular fractionation did not discriminate between membranes derived from epithelial cells (i.e. microvilli) and those from endothelial cells. The possible significance of these studies in relation to neuropeptide metabolism and the control of cerebrospinal fluid production is discussed.", 
    "436": "1. In order to examine the handling of sodium by the nephrotic kidney when separated from the immediate influences of renal nerves and humoral factors, kidneys were taken from nephrotic rats (puromycin aminonucleoside) and studied over a range of perfusion pressures using the isolated perfused kidney technique. 2. When perfused with medium containing 6.7 g/dl albumin, the nephrotic kidneys performed differently from controls with a reduction in sodium excretion at all pressures [(mean +/- SEM) 1.14 +/- 0.43 vs 4.20 +/- 0.69 mumol/min at 105 mmHg (14 kPa); 6.32 +/- 1.56 vs 44.60 +/- 5.30 mumol/min at 150 mmHg (20 kPa)]. Renal vascular resistance, inulin clearance, fractional sodium excretion and fractional lithium excretion were also reduced. 3. When kidneys were perfused without oncotic agent these differences between nephrotic and control kidneys remained. Perfusion with medium containing 10 g/dl albumin, designed to prevent glomerular filtration, abolished the difference in vascular resistance between the two groups. Captopril had no effect on the sodium retention or vascular resistance of nephrotic kidneys. 4. It was concluded that (a) the isolated nephrotic kidney demonstrates increased avidity for sodium, (b) the abnormality of sodium handling is not dependent on the presence of altered oncotic forces, and (c) the alteration in vascular resistance is conditional upon glomerular filtration.", 
    "437": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective long-term therapy for congestive heart failure, improving symptoms, exercise tolerance, biochemical anomalies, and mortality. Captopril, in doses of up to 150 mg daily is relatively free of serious adverse effects. A test dose of 6.25 mg normally precedes regular therapy in an attempt to avoid first-dose hypotension, which may also be prevented by reduction in diuretic dosage and by the avoidance of over-diuresis leading to volume depletion. We report two patients who, despite the above precautions developed symptomatic first-dose hypotension with 6.25 mg, but were subsequently able to recommence captopril therapy by the initial oral administration of doses as low as 1 mg.", 
    "438": "Evidence from animal studies demonstrates that the renin-angiotensin (ANG II) system and sodium retention play major roles in experimental renovascular hypertension (RVH). Two basic models have been described. In the first, one-clip two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension, the ischemic kidney secretes renin, which leads to increased ANG II formation and hence elevation of blood pressure (BP). As BP rises, sodium excretion by the intact contralateral kidney increases (pressure natriuresis); therefore, there is no sodium retention. In the second, one-clip one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension, the contralateral kidney is removed. In this case the pressure natriuresis can no longer occur, and sodium retention occurs. The ensuing expansion of plasma volume inhibits renin secretion, so that in this model the renin level is normal or low. Following the clipping of the renal artery, renal blood flow and pressure are maintained distal to the stenosis by an ANG II-mediated vasoconstriction. This acts preferentially on the efferent glomerular arterioles, so that the ratio of preglomerular to postglomerular resistance is reduced, which helps to maintain glomerular filtration despite the reduced renal perfusion pressure. In the contralateral kidney the afferent arteriolar resistance is increased, probably as a direct result of exposure to the higher intrarenal arterial pressure. ANG II constricts the efferent arterioles in the same way as in the ischemic kidney, so that the ratio of preglomerular to postglomerular resistance is unchanged. When an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is given, the efferent arterioles vasodilate. In the ischemic kidney this may produce a reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is not seen in the contralateral kidney. Unilateral RVH in humans corresponds closely to the animal model of one-clip two-kidney hypertension. Plasma renin activity is usually high, and converting enzyme inhibitors lower BP effectively. The increased renin is due exclusively to increased secretion of renin by the ischemic kidney, and is completely suppressed in the contralateral kidney. It is not clear whether bilateral RVH corresponds to the one-clip one-kidney model, but there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that both renin and volume factors may be involved. The majority of cases of human RVH are caused by atheroma, which is commonly bilateral, or by fibromuscular dysplasia. The former tends to be associated with atheroma elsewhere in the arterial tree, and often progresses to complete occlusion and renal failure. The latter occurs in younger patients, and almost never progresses to complete occlusion.", 
    "439": "Identification of patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) among the larger group of patients with essential hypertension has been aided by a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo nuclear medicine procedures. The most valuable in vitro procedure remains the radioimmunoassay (RIA) for renin activity obtained from individual renal vein catheterization studies. Lateralizing renin activity provides valuable prognostic information about the likelihood for surgical cure of RVH. Older in vivo procedures for the diagnosis of RVH included rectilinear scanning and probe renography, which suffered from poor resolution and specificity, respectively. These tests have been replaced by computer-interfaced gamma camera scintirenography using 131I- or 123I-labeled orthoiodohippurate (OIH), or scintiangiography using 99mTc-DTPA. False-positive (FP) results for RVH persist due to a wide variety of relatively common conditions that can cause asymmetric renal size and function, including outflow obstruction and parenchymal renal disease. Newer approaches promise to improve the specificity of nuclear medicine procedures for identification of RVH. In particular, the number of FP exams appears to improve when scintirenography is performed before and after the administration of oral angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, using either 99mTc-DTPA or OIH. The incentive for improved diagnostic testing has increased with the availability of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PCTA) for treatment of renal artery stenosis (RAS). Follow up of PCTA with scintirenography is of great value in assessing its effect on renal function and in evaluating the subsequent clinical course of the patient.", 
    "440": "The measurement of immunoreactive \"angiotensin II\" in plasma cannot provide an accurate reflection of the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition because different angiotensin fragments interfere in all radioimmunoassays available so far. More complex methods are necessary in order to measure specifically angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide. With such methodology it can be shown that no tolerance develops to the angiotensin II-reducing effect of ACE inhibitors after prolonged administration. Marked reduction of angiotensin II levels can be shown even in patients with primary aldosteronism. At peak blockade, the level of plasma angiotensin II is still related to circulating active renin and angiotensin I. Accordingly, because ACE inhibitors raise circulating angiotensin I in a dose-dependent fashion, this should be taken into account when dosing ACE inhibitors. The hypothesis that tissue renin-angiotensin systems play an important independent role in determining vasomotor tone is very interesting. However, any discussion on whether tissue or plasma renin determines the pharmacological effect of ACE inhibitors should be based on the simultaneous measurement of true angiotensin II in tissue and plasma under steady-state conditions."
