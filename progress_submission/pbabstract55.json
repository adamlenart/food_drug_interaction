    "0": "An adverse interaction between aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is suspected in patients with heart failure, but the effect of combined therapy with these agents on hospital readmission rates is unknown. Our study found that combining aspirin with ACE inhibitors is associated with higher early readmission rates than use of ACE inhibitors alone, particularly in patients with depressed ejection fraction and in those without coronary artery disease.", 
    "1": "We studied whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with quinapril treatment can prevent in-stent restenosis after successful implantation of Palmaz-Schatz stents. Intravascular ultrasound study, but not quantitative coronary angiography analysis, revealed that quinapril treatment significantly prevented the loss of both minimal lumen cross-sectional area and lumen volume in stents, in addition to reducing the increase in intimal hyperplasia volume.", 
    "2": "Rapid cooling contractures were used in this study to test whether low-dose ramipril improves sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) uptake and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger function in isolated hypertrophied rat myocytes. Compensated cardiac hypertrophy was induced by abdominal aortic constriction for 5 wk followed by administration of ramipril (50 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or vehicle for 4 wk. Myocyte cell length and cell width were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in both hypertrophied groups (+/-ramipril). Myocytes were loaded with indo 1, and relaxation was investigated after rapid cooling. Hypertrophied myocyte relaxation in Na(+)-free/Ca(2+)-free solution was 63% slower (P < 0.01) and the fall in intracellular Ca(2+) was 60% slower (P < 0.05) than the relaxation of control cells. After ramipril treatment both relaxation and the decline in intracellular Ca(2+) returned to control rates through improved SR Ca(2+)-ATPase function. Relaxation in caffeine showed no change after hypertrophy; however, after ramipril treatment the time to 50% relaxation in caffeine decreased by 30% (P < 0.05). The improvement in Ca(2+) extrusion across the sarcolemmal membrane occurred independently of changes in Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger mRNA and protein abundance. These data demonstrate that ramipril improves both SR-dependent and non-SR-dependent calcium cycling after established cardiac hypertrophy. However, the improvements in function are independent of transcriptional activation and likely to involve altered intracellular ion concentrations.", 
    "3": "Endothelial function is abnormal in a variety of diseased states such as hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. This may be secondary to decreased synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and/or increased degradation of NO due to interaction with superoxide anions. More recent experimental observations demonstrate increased production of superoxide in hyperlipidemia, suggesting that endothelial dysfunction in these states is in part secondary to increased NO metabolism. Enzymes proposed to be involved in increased superoxide production may include xanthine oxidase, the NO synthase, and the NAD(P)H oxidase. Superoxide rapidly reacts with NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a highly reactive intermediate with cytotoxic properties. Despite experimental evidence for the oxidative stress concept in causing endothelial dysfunction, the results of recent randomized trials to test the influence of antioxidants on coronary event rates and prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease were very disappointing. In all of these studies the use of vitamins such as vitamin E failed to improve the prognosis. In contrast, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or cholesterol- lowering drugs improved endothelial dysfunction, prevented the activation of superoxide-producing enzymes in cholesterol-fed animals, reduced coronary event rates, and improved prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, inhibition of superoxide production at the enzymatic level rather than symptomatic superoxide scavenging may be the better choice of treatment.", 
    "4": "Over the past several decades, we have made great strides in understanding the pathophysiology of heart failure and have developed new therapeutic targets based on utilizing several different models in clinical trials. Currently, standard therapy involves angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. In an effort to further reduce mortality, investigators focused on other vasodilators (calcium channel blockers) that might prove to be advantageous when added to standard therapy. Large- scale trials showed that the calcium channel blockers did not have a specific role in mortality reduction, but the third-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were safe to use in patients with heart failure.", 
    "5": "During the past 10 years, the philosophy of heart failure treatment has evolved from symptom control to a combined prevention and symptom-management strategy. Recent clinical trials have proved that early detection can delay progression. Treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction is as important as treatment of symptomatic disease. The purpose of this review is to simplify recent guidelines for pharmacological management of chronic systolic heart failure for the primary care physician and the heart failure specialist. Early recognition and prevention therapies, combined with lifestyle modification, are essential in the treatment of heart failure. Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics is now standard. Digoxin is added to improve clinical symptoms, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation. Aldosterone antagonists may be recommended in select patients with stable New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure. If angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are not tolerated, angiotensin receptor blockers, hydralazine hydrochloride, and isosorbide dinitrate are recommended. The data on antiarrhythmic and anticoagulation therapies are inconclusive.", 
    "6": "Congestive heart failure is the most common reason for hospitalization in the United States, and guidelines to improve the quality of care for patients with congestive heart failure have been developed. However, adherence is typically low. We hypothesized that a guideline-based care management team would result in greater quality and efficiency of care than guidelines alone.", 
    "7": "A faculty cardiologist and nurse care manager at an academic medical center reviewed each patient's data and made guideline-based recommendations. Hospital length of stay, total costs, and use of recommended guidelines were compared between 173 patients before team implementation but with available guidelines, 283 care-managed patients, and 126 concurrent non-care-managed patients.", 
    "8": "Care-managed patients achieved higher rates of use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor than baseline or non-care-managed patients (95%, 60%, and 75%, respectively; P<.001), as well as increased adherence to guidelines for daily weight monitoring and assessment of left ventricular function. Hospital length of stay was lower (median, 3, 4, and 5 days, respectively; P<.001) as were costs of hospitalization (median, $2934, $3209, and $4830, respectively; P<.01). These differences persisted after adjustment for severity of illness.", 
    "9": "When compared with dissemination of guidelines alone, an active care management approach was associated with significant improvements in quality and efficiency of care for hospitalized patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "10": "Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials, primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents, especially at the recommended doses. The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high- compared with low-dose lisinopril in CHF.", 
    "11": "The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium-dose lisinopril (12.5 or 15.0 mg once daily [OD]) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high- (35.0 or 32.5 mg OD) or low-dose (5.0 or 2.5 mg OD) groups. Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0.30 (n = 3164) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months. We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment, with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction.", 
    "12": "Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor, doses in only 4.2% could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension (2.0%) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia (2.3%). Doses in more than 90% of randomized patients in the high- and low-dose groups were titrated to their assigned target, and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study. Withdrawals occurred in 27.1% of the high- and 30.7% of the low-dose groups. Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance (blood pressure, <120 mm Hg; creatinine, > or =132.6 micromol/L [> or =1.5 mg/dL]; age, > or =70 years; and patients with diabetes) generally tolerated the high-dose strategy.", 
    "13": "These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses, and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted.", 
    "14": "Captopril is known to inhibit the growth of renal cancer but the mechanism involved has been unclear. The current study elucidates the mechanism of captopril induced inhibition of the growth of the Renca mouse renal cancer cell line involving transforming growth factor-beta, which is known to be a growth inhibitory cytokine in epithelial cells and tissues.", 
    "15": "Transforming growth factor-beta in conditioned medium was measured by bioassay. Levels of transforming growth factor-beta and transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor expression messenger RNA were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. Cell viability was determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and tetrazolium bromide assay.", 
    "16": "Captopril (0.01 to 1 mM.) showed no significant effect on transforming growth factor-beta synthesis or transforming growth factor-beta messenger RNA in Renca cells. On the other hand, 1 mM. captopril significantly inhibited Renca cell growth. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry showed that 1 mM. captopril up-regulated type II receptor expression.", 
    "17": "These findings suggest that captopril restores transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor expression and inhibits the growth of Renca cells by increasing their sensitivity to transforming growth factor-beta.", 
    "18": "Hypertension plays a critical role in causing a high rate of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Large trials show that lowering blood pressure in the patient with diabetes who has hypertension has profoundly favorable effects. This review discusses recent trials to answer the question of how low patients' blood pressure should go and which agents should be used to achieve this goal. The National Institutes of Health's guidelines, published in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, call for a blood pressure goal of <130/85 mmHg in patients with diabetes. Based on data from the recent trials, an even lower blood pressure of <130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes and hypertension appears to be appropriate. Observational studies show that the lowest cardiovascular event rate is observed in patients with diabetes whose systolic blood pressure is <120 mmHg. Thus, goal blood pressure in patients with diabetes who have hypertension may need to be revised lower, to <120/80 mmHg. In patients with overt proteinuria of 1 g/d or more, mean arterial pressure of <92 mmHg is recommended. Available evidence justifies the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-line agents and angiotensin receptor blockers in those patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors. Because the blood pressure goal is lower in patients with diabetes who are hypertensive, these patients require the use of multiple agents. Diuretics or long-acting calcium channel blockers are logical second choices because of their synergistic blood pressure reduction effect observed with ACE inhibitors. Alpha-blockers should be used with caution, however. In patients with renal disease, loop diuretics may be required to reduce sodium and volume overload and to improve blood pressure control.", 
    "19": "The incidence of chronic heart failure has increased, with a corresponding increase in morbidity and mortality, and has made a substantial financial impact on our society. Improved therapy for heart failure has resulted in a significant prolongation of survival, a decreased number of hospitalizations, and an enhanced quality of life for many patients. It can reasonably be expected, therefore, that adherence to a rational medical regimen for these patients might decrease costs as well. Management of patients with severe heart failure begins with identifying the etiology and educating the patients and their families. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the cornerstone of therapy but only after diagnostic tests are performed to establish the etiology and extent of myocardial dysfunction. Because cardiac transplantation is a therapeutic option for only a limited number of patients, other surgical and medical therapies have to be viewed as the mainstay of a treatment strategy.", 
    "20": "The principal goals of treatment of the patient in heart failure are the relief of their symptoms and improvement in their prognosis. Of all antiheart failure drugs currently available, the diuretics are therapeutically superior in their efficacy in relieving clinical symptoms and signs. Whether administered intravenously or orally, all diuretics result in a substantial reduction in the raised pulmonary vascular pressures in combination with a small reduction in cardiac output. Diuretics stimulate release of renin with subsequent activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, particularly if used in large doses, although their quantitative impact on the neuroendocrine profile at different stages of heart failure remains to be defined. In patients with mild heart failure, diuretics reduce plasma catecholamine concentrations, but their sympatholytic effects in more severe cases are unknown, as are their effects on the metabolically active tissues in these patients. Diuretic resistance can be circumvented by segmental nephron blockade with a combination of low-dose diuretics that simultaneously block sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal tubule, and the collecting duct. Diuretics improve symptoms of breathlessness and signs of peripheral edema in patients with congestive heart failure in direct relationship to the induced diuresis. These benefits are frequently associated with a substantial improvement in patients' appreciation of quality of life and economic capacity. There are few adverse reactions to chronic diuretic therapy, but the serum electrolytes should be monitored for hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. The impact of diuretics on prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure is unknown; however, diuretics have been a major ingredient of the therapies used in all the survival trials with vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blocking drugs. In addition to their clinical benefits, diuretics are the most cost-effective treatment of any single drug group currently available for the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "21": "Renovascular hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis accounts for a small portion of overall hypertension but remains important as the most common potentially curable form of high blood pressure. Diagnosis depends on developing an index of suspicion for renovascular hypertension based on the history and physical exam, as well as judicious use of noninvasive and invasive testing. Determining which noninvasive diagnostic test to use remains a persistent dilemma. Treatment options include renal artery angioplasty, arterial stenting, surgery, and medical therapy. The goals of therapy are reduction of blood pressure and protection of renal function. This review discusses the pathophysiology and epidemiology of renovascular hypertension, various noninvasive tests used in diagnosis, and results offered by different treatment modalities. A diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm is offered based on a review of the literature and the experience at our institution.", 
    "22": "Cardiac complications are the major cause of death in patients with beta-thalassemia major. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on left ventricular (LV) performance, with an emphasis on diastolic LV function because diastolic dysfunction has been found to be an early event in an asymptomatic thalassemic population with only mild impairment of LV systolic function.", 
    "23": "We used echocardiography to study the impact of treatment with oral enalapril on the evolution of standard M-mode and Doppler indices, along with a recently introduced Doppler index of combined systolic and diastolic LV performance.", 
    "24": "Patients were found to have significantly increased LV end-diastolic dimensions (LVEDD), LV end-systolic dimensions (LVESD), and left atrial dimensions and decreased LV fractional shortening (LVFS) compared with controls. After treatment with enalapril, LVESD decreased from 3.58 +/- 0.3 cm to 3.23 +/- 0.4 cm (P <.01) and LVFS increased from 32.6% +/- 4.0% to 38.0% +/- 3.1% (P <.001). Patients at baseline were found to have a significantly higher E-wave velocity, E/A ratio, and Doppler index compared with controls. The E-wave deceleration time was significantly shorter compared with that of controls. After treatment with enalapril, the E/A ratio decreased from 2.10 +/- 0.42 to 1.50 +/- 0.30 (P <.05), E-wave deceleration time increased from 0.12 +/- 0.02 seconds to 0.15 +/- 0.03 seconds (P <.01), and the Doppler index decreased from 0.46 +/- 0.10 to 0.37 +/- 0.14 (P <.05).", 
    "25": "Enalapril was well tolerated in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with LV dysfunction resulting from beta-thalassemia major. Echocardiographically we demonstrated significant improvement in LV systolic and diastolic function. Whether this translates to improved long-term prognosis and survival remains to be further evaluated.", 
    "26": "Increased left ventricular (LV) wall stress after myocardial infarction (MI) has been implicated in LV remodeling. However, the relationship between LV wall stress and LV remodeling is incompletely defined.", 
    "27": "We prospectively studied the relationship between regional wall stress and LV remodeling by application of the finite element method to end-systolic LV models from patients enrolled in the Healing and Early Afterload Reducing Therapy (HEART) Trial. Individual LV models were constructed from orthogonal apical echocardiographic views obtained at day 14 after anteroseptal MI in 64 patients. Of these, 31 patients received low-dose (0.625 mg) ramipril and 33 patients received full-dose (10 mg) ramipril. LV wall stress was calculated by the finite element method and correlated with change in LV volume from day 14 to day 90 after MI.", 
    "28": "Among all patients, increases in apical regional wall stress were associated with LV volume changes (P -trend =.015). The relationship between apical regional wall stress and change in LV volume was strongest in the low-dose ramipril group (r = 0.53, P =.002) and remained significant after adjustment for end-diastolic volume, infarct size, ejection fraction, and systolic blood pressure yet was attenuated in the full-dose ramipril group.", 
    "29": "Apical regional wall stress is an independent predictor of subsequent LV remodeling after MI. The relationship between increased apical wall stress and LV dilatation appears to be attenuated by full-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "30": "Clinical trials have shown the efficacy of aspirin for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, not all patients receive aspirin for AMI. The aim of this study was to provide information on characteristics and clinical course of patients not treated with aspirin for AMI.", 
    "31": "We analyzed the data of the Myocardial Infarction Registry (MIR) and the Maximal Individual Therapy of Acute Myocardial Infarction (MITRA) registry. MITRA and MIR were prospective multicenter registries of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in Germany.", 
    "32": "Of 22,572 patients registered from 1994 to 1998, 1767 (7.8%) did not receive aspirin within the first 48 hours after admission. Multivariate analysis revealed two main factors associated with withholding aspirin for AMI: relative contraindications to aspirin (gastric ulcer [odds ratio (OR) 4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.7-5.7], renal insufficiency [OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8]), and critical clinical state at admission (cardiogenic shock [OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-2.1] and prehospital resuscitation [OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.2]). In addition, these patients were significantly less likely to receive reperfusion therapy and adjunctive medical therapy such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In-hospital mortality after adjustment for baseline characteristics was 27.2% in patients without aspirin compared with 11.1% in patients treated with aspirin.", 
    "33": "Only a minority of AMI patients (7.8%) did not receive aspirin. Relative contraindications to aspirin and a critical clinical state at admission were the main factors associated with withholding aspirin for AMI. Even after adjustment for patient characteristics, the mortality of patients without aspirin was almost three times higher.", 
    "34": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion in rats augments vascular injury in balloon-injured carotid arteries and induces marked vascular and tubulointerstitial injury in kidneys. We examined how the AT1 receptor is modulated and whether blockade of the receptor with losartan could prevent the phenotypic and cellular changes. We also examined the role of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by examining the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the effect of treatment with the ACE inhibitor, ramipril. Ang II infusion resulted in systemic hypertension and accelerated intimal and medial thickening in balloon-injured carotid arteries. Renal injury was manifested by proteinuria, glomerular phenotypic changes (mesangial expression of alpha-actin and podocyte expression of desmin), and tubulointerstitial injury with the tubular upregulation of the macrophage-adhesive protein, osteopontin, the interstitial accumulation of macrophages and myofibroblasts, and the deposition of collagen types III and IV. Ang II infusion decreased AT1 receptor number in the renal interstitium but not in glomeruli. Losartan completely blocked the Ang II-mediated hypertension, proteinuria, and injury to both carotid and kidney. Ang II infusion was also associated with an increase in ACE protein in both the proximal tubular brush border as well as at interstitial sites of injury, but despite evidence for activation of the local RAS, treatment with ramipril was without effect. These studies demonstrate that the renal and vascular injury induced by Ang II infusion is mediated by the AT1 receptor despite downregulation of the receptor in the interstitium. In addition, although there is evidence for local RAS activation, the injury appears to be mediated solely by the exogenous Ang II.", 
    "35": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are renoprotective in diabetes mellitus through their intrarenal hemodynamic effects. Alpha-1 blockade has variable pre- and postglomerular vasodilatory effects dependent upon the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. We tested the hypothesis that the two different classes of drugs have similar renal hemodynamic effects when the patients are examined in an upright position where the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Mean blood pressure (MAP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were examined in 28 hypertensive type-1 diabetic patients with variable degree of nephropathy treated for a mean period of 7.6 +/- 0.4 months with captopril (n = 13) or doxazosin (n = 15). Average treatment doses were 112 +/- 7 mg/day in the captopril group and 8 +/- 1 mg/day in the doxazosin group. Sitting MAP decreased from 118 +/- 3 to 106 +/- 4 mm Hg after captopril (p < 0.05), and from 117 +/- 4 to 110 +/- 3 mm Hg after doxazosin (p = 0.07). GFR and ERPF were unchanged in both groups. The filtration fraction (FF) decreased from 0.27 +/- 0.02 to 0.25 +/- 0.02 after captopril (p < 0.05) and from 0.26 +/- 0.01 to 0.25 +/- 0.01 after doxazosin (p = 0.08). Calculation of 95% confidence intervals of the difference between the post-treatment values as well as the difference between pre- and post-treatment values of MAP, GFR, ERPF and FF of the two drugs indicates no difference in renal hemodynamic response between the drugs. In conclusion, captopril and doxazosin have similar renal hemodynamic responses when the patients are examined in a situation where the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated, and this suggests that doxazosin has a renoprotective effect beyond the blood pressure-lowering effect.", 
    "36": "This study was carried out on conscious two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) rats to establish whether different levels of hypertension induced opposite diuretic behaviors from the nonclipped kidney. Mildly hypertensive rats and severely hypertensive rats were produced by, respectively, constricting their right renal arteries with 0.3-mm and 0.15-mm clips. On the 11th day of the study, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the 0.3-mm clip rats was 150 +/- 2 mm Hg, the water intake was 24 +/- 1 ml, and the urine output was 7 +/- 1 ml. The SBP of the 0.15-mm clip rats was 231 +/- 10 mm Hg, the water intake was 46 +/- 4 ml, and the urine output was 27 +/- 6 ml. The data from the two groups are significantly different. On the 19th day half of the mildly hypertensive (0.3-mm clip) rats that received cilazapril from day 15 had, with respect to their water-treated counterparts, a SBP of 140 +/- 8 as compared with 159 +/- 7 mm Hg, the water intake was 37 +/- 5 as compared with 26 +/- 4 ml, and the urine output was 18 +/- 4 as compared with 12 +/- 1 ml. In contrast, half of the severely hypertensive (0.15-mm clip) rats that received cilazapril had, with respect to their water-treated counterparts, a SBP of 143 +/- 4 as compared with 227 +/- 10 mm Hg, the water intake was 30 +/- 2 as compared with 51 +/- 9 ml, and the urine output was 8 +/- 2 as compared with 29 +/- 4 ml. All changes induced by cilazapril are significant in both groups. The data of this study suggest that different levels of hypertension in the rat 2K1C model induce opposite water elimination modes from the nonclipped kidney. This conclusion is supported by the different shift in the water intake and urine output among the cilazapril-treated rats of the two groups. This contrast in the response to cilazapril seems to be dependent on the magnitude of the resulting hypotension. Thus, it seems that in this model, when the hypertension is mild, the antidiuretic effect of angiotension II on the nonclipped kidney is exhibited, whereas, when the hypertension is severe, the diuretic influence of the blood pressure is evident. Irrespective of these different characteristics of the submodels of 2K1C, angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors, such as cilazapril, are effective in normalizing the blood pressure.", 
    "37": "This study was undertaken to determine whether angiotensin receptor blockers are as renoprotective as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in an experimental model of chronic interstitial renal disease. Groups of rats received one of the following treatments for 1 week: (1) enalapril, (2) diltiazem, (3) a cocktail of hydralazine, reserpine, and hydrochlorothiazide, or (4) irbesartan (an AT1 antagonist). The animals were injected with bromoethylamine (200 mg/kg), and antihypertensive treatment continued for 1 month. All drugs were effective in lowering the mean arterial pressure. The bromoethylamine-treated rats developed albuminuria and sustained a 40-50% decrease in creatinine clearance. Enalapril and irbesartan reduced albuminuria, but only enalapril partially prevented the decline in creatinine clearance and lowered the number of ED-1-positive cells. Diltiazem and cocktail had no effect on proteinuria, creatinine clearance, or ED-1 cells. In this experimental model, the effects of enalapril and irbesartan were not identical. Both drugs reduced proteinuria, but enalapril was more effective in protecting the renal function. The fact that the AT1 antagonist protected against albuminuria but did not affect the clearance of creatinine implies that the results seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may be in part due to an effect on angiotensin II via AT2 receptor blockade or through an effect on bradykinin.", 
    "38": "Many physicians are not adhering to the recommendations found in evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Physicians who practise in tertiary care settings may show better adherence to guideline recommendations than physicians who practise in other settings.",

    "40": "Discharge prescription data from a prospective cohort of patients with AMI admitted at five tertiary care (n=250) and five community hospitals (n=331) in Quebec from December 1996 to November 1998 were examined.", 
    "41": "The proportions of patients who were prescribed recommended drugs at tertiary care hospitals compared with those at community hospitals were as follows: beta-blockers (78% versus 74%, respectively; 95% CI around the difference - 4% to 11%), lipid-lowering drugs (45% versus 39%, respectively; 95% CI - 2% to 15%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (44% versus 57%, respectively; 95% CI - 22% to - 5%). In adjusted analyses, practice setting was not associated with the prescription of beta-blockers (odds ratio [OR] for tertiary care 1.36; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.24) or lipid-lowering drugs (OR for tertiary care 1.06; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.68). However, tertiary care admission reduced the likelihood of ACE inhibitor prescription (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.77). This association may have been due to the increased likelihood of ACE inhibitor prescription for patients with hypertension at community hospitals (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.23 to 3.67). The results also showed that older patients were less likely to be prescribed beta-blockers or lipid-lowering drugs, women were less likely to be prescribed beta-blockers and patients with diabetes mellitus were less likely to be prescribed lipid-lowering drugs (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.89).", 
    "42": "No strong association was found between the practice setting of admission for AMI and discharge prescriptions for cardiac drugs recommended in evidence-based guidelines.

    "45": "In a randomized, double-blind comparison between early treatment with captopril or atenolol in 121 patients with acute anterior MI, both drugs showed a similar reduction in mean blood pressure. However, only the atenolol-treated patients showed a significant early reduction in heart rate. Infarct size, obtained from the perfusion defect in resting single photon emission imaging, was higher in captopril-treated patients than in atenolol-treated patients: 29.8+/-12% versus 20.8+/-12% (P:<0.01) by polar map and 28.3+/-13% versus 20.0+/-13% (P:<0.01) by tomography. Changes from baseline to 1 week and to 3 months in ventricular end-diastolic volume, assessed by echocardiography, were as follows: 58+/-14 versus 64+/-19 (P<0.05) and 65+/-21 mL/m(2) (P<0.05), respectively, with captopril, and 58+/-18 versus 64+/-18 (P<0.05) and 69+/-30 mL/m(2) (P<0.05), respectively, with atenolol. Neither group showed significant changes in end-systolic volume.

We hypothesized that both ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT(1)-A) increase bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) by reducing oxidative stress in the vessel wall, possibly by increasing EC-SOD activity.", 
    "48": "Thirty-five patients with CAD were randomized to 4 weeks of ACEI (ramipril 10 mg/d) or AT(1)-A (losartan 100 mg/d). FDD of the radial artery was determined by high-resolution ultrasound before and after intra-arterial N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) to inhibit NO synthase and before and after intra-arterial vitamin C to determine the portion of FDD inhibited by oxygen free radicals. EC-SOD activity was determined after release from endothelium by heparin bolus injection. FDD was improved after ramipril and losartan (each group P<0.01), and in particular, the portion of FDD mediated by NO, ie, inhibited by L-NMMA, was increased by >75% (each group P<0.01). Vitamin C improved FDD initially, an effect that was lost after ramipril or losartan. After therapy, EC-SOD activity was increased by >200% in both groups (ACEI, 14.4+/-1.1 versus 3.8+/-0.9 and AT(1)-A, 13.5+/-1.0 versus 3.9+/-0.9 U. mL(-1). min(-1); each P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS-Four weeks of therapy with ramipril or losartan improves endothelial function to similar extents in patients with CAD by increasing the bioavailability of NO. Our results suggest that beneficial long-term effects of interference with the renin-angiotensin system may be related to reduction of oxidative stress within the arterial wall, mediated in part by increased EC-SOD activity.", 
    "49": "The effects of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system on the renal metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) were examined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with vehicle, captopril (25 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), enalapril (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), or candesartan (1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 1 wk. The production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by renal cortical microsomes increased in rats treated with captopril by 59 and 24% and by 90 and 58% in rats treated with enalapril. Captopril and enalapril increased 20-HETE production in the outer medulla by 100 and 143%, respectively. In contrast, blockade of ANG II type 1 receptors with candesartan had no effect on the renal metabolism of AA. Captopril and enalapril increased cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) reductase protein levels in the renal cortex and outer medulla and the expression of CYP450 4A protein in the outer medulla. The effects of captopril on the renal metabolism of AA were prevented by the bradykinin-receptor antagonist, HOE-140, or the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. These results suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may increase the formation of 20-HETE and EETs secondary to increases in the intrarenal levels of kinins and NO.", 
    "50": "Changes in tissue protein synthesis in hypertension have usually been measured in vitro in heart from acutely hypertensive rats without consideration of changes in atrial or pulmonary tissue or changes occurring in long-standing hypertension. The objective of the study was to investigate the in vivo changes in cardiopulmonary protein synthesis in three different rat models of chronic hypertension. Hypertension in aortic constriction, the Goldblatt model, and the bromoethylamine model were induced in rats for 30 days. At the end of the experimental period, in vivo rates of protein synthesis were measured with a flooding dose of [3H]phenylalanine (a method which effectively considers precursor pools). Concomitant measurements included quantification of contractile protein and RNA and DNA contents. Indices of protein breakdown were also assessed by selective measurement of protease activities. At the end of 30 days, aortic constriction induced marked increases in protein contents of the left ventricle, septum, left atria, and lungs. Accompanying changes included concomitant increases in RNA and DNA contents. Left ventricular myofibrillary, sarcoplasmic, and stromal protein contents increased in the aortic constriction model. Less marked changes occurred in the Goldblatt model, though the left atria were not significantly affected. In contrast, the bromoethylamine model had no effect on the protein or RNA contents of any region. In all cardiac regions of all three models, fractional rates of protein synthesis were not significantly affected. However, protein synthesis increased in the lungs of both the Goldblatt and bromoethylamine models at 30 days. Protease activities were decreased in the left ventricles of all three models at 30 days, with lysosomal protease activities declining in the aortic constriction model and cytoplasmic protease activities declining in the other two models. The failure of chronic hypertension to increase ventricular synthesis rates may represent inherent limitations in the time frame for measuring protein synthesis in vivo. However, at earlier time points (i.e., 10 days), the aortic constriction model was characterized by marked increases in left ventricular and atrial protein contents, RNA contents, and fractional rates of protein synthesis. This was consistent with the supposition that, in acute phases of hypertrophy, rates of protein synthesis increase, whereas in established hypertrophy, synthesis rates remain unchanged or decrease. The applicability of the aortic constriction model was investigated by examining the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (5 mg/kg/day). After 30 days treatment, lisinopril impeded the increase in left ventricular mixed and myofibrillar proteins. This effect was accompanied by an apparent increase in protein synthesis. In conclusion, although all three chronic models are able to induce hypertension, varying degrees of hypertrophy develop, which are more pronounced in the aortic constriction model. Accompanying changes include hypertrophy in the atria, reduced rates of ventricular proteolytic activity, and altered rates of protein metabolism in the lungs.", 
    "51": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides prepared from soy protein by the action of alcalase enzyme was tested for its hypotensive effect on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Captopril, an ACE inhibitor used widely for hypertension treatment, was also applied in comparison. A significant (p < 0.05) decrease in systolic blood pressure of SHR was observed when soy ACE inhibitory peptides were orally administrated at three different dose levels (100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg of body weight/day), whereas little change occurred in the blood pressure of normotensive rats even at the highest dose. After a month-long feeding, blood pressure readings of SHR fell by approximately 38 mmHg from the original level at the lowest dose; a steadily and progressively hypotensive effect existed for these soy ACE inhibitory peptides administration groups. An obvious fluctuation was observed at the third week, although Captopril had a stronger hypotensive effect. The ACE activity of serum, aorta and lung, and lipid content of serum of SHR upon administration of soy ACE inhibitory peptides did not show a significant difference from that of the control group, whereas the serum ACE activity increased and the aorta ACE activity decreased significantly (p < 0.05) for the Captopril group. Serum Na(+) concentration decreased significantly in both the peptides-treated groups and the Captopril-treated group in comparison with the control group, whereas no lowering effect was observed for serum K(+) and serum Ca(2+) concentrations. These results suggested that the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitory peptides derived from soy protein could be at least partly attributed to the action on salt/water balance.",

The clinical course was frequently characterized by acute flare ups, and the progression to end-stage renal failure was more frequent, although actuarial renal survival was not significantly worse (P = 0.07).

    "56": "Transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and renal disease. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) comprises a family of dimeric transcription factors that regulate the expression of numerous genes involved in inflammation and cell proliferation. Although NF-kappa B was initially identified in lymphocytes, it has been found to be a transcription factor present in virtually all cell types. In resting cells, NF-kappa B dimers remain in the cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to the inhibitory subunit I kappa B. Upon stimulation, I kappa B is phosphorylated, ubiquitinylated, and ultimately degraded by proteolytic cleavage by the proteasome system. As a result, NF-kappa B dimers are translocated into the nucleus and activate the transcription of target genes. Increasing data suggest a pivotal role for NF-kappa B in a variety of pathophysiological conditions in which either inflammation or cell number control are critical events. NF-kappa B has been found to be activated in experimental renal disease. Importantly, both in vivo and in vitro, NF-kappa B activation can be modulated by pharmacological maneuvers. Indeed, it is now widely acknowledged that the anti-inflammatory action of steroids is basically obtained through the inhibition of the transactivation of NF-kappa B-dependent genes. In addition, some of the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins may, at least in part, be mediated by an inhibition of NF-kappa B activation. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in NF-kappa B regulation and its modulation may provide new tools to improve the treatment of renal diseases with a better sound pathophysiological approach.", 
    "57": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was analyzed in human urine collected from mild hypertensive untreated patients. DEAE-cellulose chromatography using linear gradient elution revealed two forms of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, eluted in the conductivity of 0.75 and 1.25 mS. The fractions of each conductivity were pooled and submitted to direct gel filtration in an AcA-34 column, and the apparent molecular weights of urinary ACEs were estimated as 90 kDa (for ACE eluted in 0.75 mS) and 65 kDa (for ACE eluted in 1.25 mS). Both enzymes have a K(i) of the order of 10(-7) M for the specific inhibitors studied, and are able to hydrolyze luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro as described for N-domain ACE. By Western blot analysis, both peaks were recognized by ACE-specific antibody Y4, confirming the molecular weight already described. A plate precipitation assay using monoclonal antibodies to the N-domain of ACE showed that both forms of ACE binds with all monoclonal antibodies to the active N-domain ACE, suggesting that these forms of human urine ACEs resemble the N-fragment of ACE. The HP2 ACE (65 kDa) is similar to low molecular weight (LMW) ACE from normal subjects, and the HP2 ACE (90 kDa) is different from high molecular weight (190 kDa) and LMW (65 kDa) normal ACEs. The 90 kDa ACE could have an important role in development of hypertension. It will be fundamental to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for the genesis of this isoform.", 
    "58": "Oligopeptides of 1 KDa or less were obtained by hydrolysis of chicken egg yolks with a crude enzyme, and by dialysis with a semipermeable membrane filter. Since the extracted peptides had an inhibitory action on the activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro, they were orally administered at 20, 100 and 500 mg/kg body weight to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) for 12 weeks to analyze the physiological role on cardiovascular functions. The administered oligopeptides suppressed the development of hypertension at all dosages. After 12 weeks at 500 mg/kg body weight, the values for systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressure were approximately 10% less in SHRs administered than controls. Furthermore, serum ACE activity of the peptide-administered groups was significantly lower than that of the control group in a dose-related manner. Our results imply that oligopeptides extracted from hen's egg yolks could potentially suppress the development of hypertension in SHR, and this effect might be induced by the inhibition of ACE activity.",

    "60": "To study the effects of captopril on tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), we determined the TNF-alpha concentrations of culture supernatants of PBMC with and without catopril in 74 CHF patients with various heart diseases. The results showed that the supernatants concentrations of TNF-alpha in cultured PBMC (PBMC-TNF-alpha) were significantly increased in non-cachetic and cachetic CHF patients, and even higher in cachetic CHF patients, as compared with the controls (i.e., patients with New York Heart Association CHF classification I). The PBMC-TNF-alpha was significantly inhibited by captopril. These results demonstrate that the expression of TNF-alpha in PBMC is increased and can be inhibited by captopril in patients with CHF, especially in those accompanied by cachexia. This suggests that the immunomodulatory effects of captopril may contribute to its beneficial effects in heart failure patients.",

During the simultaneous infusion of captopril and angiotensin II (0.1 ng/kg/min), cesium produced sustained ventricular tachycardia in all six dogs and the arrhythmia developed into ventricular fibrillation in three dogs. By increasing the dose of angiotensin II (1.0 ng/kg/min), the surviving three dogs died following induced ventricular fibrillation. The additional infusion of angiotensin II (0.1 and 1.0 ng/kg/min) significantly increased fatal arrhythmias (P<0.01 vs. only captopril- infused period, respectively). None of the dogs in the third group exhibited ventricular tachycardia during the infusion of U-73122, and ventricular fibrillations were recorded in all six dogs in the absence of U-73122.

    "65": "The antinociceptive effects of intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered dynorphin A, an endogenous agonist for kappa-opioid receptors, in combination with various protease inhibitors were examined using the mouse formalin test in order to clarify the nature of the proteases involved in the degradation of dynorphin A in the mouse brain. When administered i.c.v. 15 min before the injection of 2% formalin solution into the dorsal surface of a hindpaw, 1-4 nmol dynorphin A produced a dose-dependent reduction of the nociceptive behavioral response consisting of licking and biting of the injected paw during both the first (0-5 min) and second (10-30 min) phases. When co-administered with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (PHMB), a cysteine protease inhibitor, dynorphin A at the subthreshold dose of 0.5 nmol significantly produced an antinociceptive effect during the second phase. This effect was significantly antagonized by nor-binaltorphimine, a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, but not by naltrindole, a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist. At the same dose of 0.5 nmol, dynorphin A in combination with phosphoramidon, an endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, produced a significant antinociceptive effect during both phases. The antinociceptive effect was significantly antagonized by naltrindole, but not by nor-binaltorphimine. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a serine protease inhibitor, bestatin, a general aminopeptidase inhibitor, and captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, were all inactive. The degradation of dynorphin A by mouse brain extracts in vitro was significantly inhibited only by the cysteine protease inhibitors PHMB and N-ethylmaleimide, but not by PMSF, phosphoramidon, bestatin or captopril. The present results indicate that cysteine proteases as well as endopeptidase 24.11 are involved in two steps in the degradation of dynorphin A in the mouse brain, and that phosphoramidon inhibits the degradation of intermediary delta-opioid receptor active fragments enkephalins which are formed from dynorphin A.", 
    "66": "Experimental observations in several species have suggested that angiotensinergic neural circuits from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) to the subfornical organ (SFO) may participate in the control of drinking behavior in the rat. In an attempt to verify this possibility, experiments were undertaken to investigate whether activation of LHA neurons following microinjection of angiotensin II (ANG II) into the LHA elicits drinking. Injections of ANG II (10(-11) mol) into the LHA caused drinking in 25 out of 36 rats having the tips of cannulas in the LHA. The efficacy of ANG II was potentiated by increasing the dose of the drug. To clarify the contribution of angiotensinergic neurons in the LHA with efferent projections to the SFO to the drinking induced by ANG II, the effects of pretreatment with saralasin (Sar), a specific ANG II antagonist, in the SFO or its surrounding region on the drinking to ANG II were examined. Previous injections of Sar into the SFO significantly reduced the water intake caused by ANG II injected into the LHA, whereas treatment with Sar in the ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) or third ventricle (3V) was without effect. These findings provide the evidence for the involvement of the angiotensinergic pathways from the LHA to the SFO in the dipsogenic action.",

Many researchers have suggested that in the presence of endothelial cell layer, CD34+CD38- cells are capable of expansion. The ability of the endothelial cell layer to protect hematopoietic stem cells from extensive differentiation may be related to the inhibitors derived from endothelial cells. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the inhibitors thymosin beta4 and AcSDKP are elaborated by murine bone marrow endothelial cells. Murine bone marrow endothelial cells (mBMECs) were cultured in serum-free conditioned medium. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze the differential expression of the thymosin-beta gene, and reverse phase high-performance chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectroscopy were used to determine the concentration of thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) and AcSDKP in EC lysate and in the medium (mBMEC-CM). Colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colony assays were used to examine the effect of components (mw 3-10 kD, <3 kD) of mBMEC-CM, thymosin beta4, and AcSDKP on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells.mBMECs expressed Tbeta4 mRNA. In EC lysate and mBMEC-CM, Tbeta4 and AcSDKP were detected. After adding protease inhibitors, the concentration of Tbeta4 in EC lysate increased significantly, while the concentration of AcSDKP decreased. mBMEC-CM (mw 3-10 kD) had no effect on the formation of CFU-GM. However, mBMEC-CM (mw <3 kD) could inhibit the growth of CFU-GM. Tbeta4 (10(-11) approximately 10(-7)mol/L) and AcSDKP (10(-11) approximately 10(-5)mol/L) had dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the growth of CFU-GM. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), the enzyme degrading AcSDKP, could partially eliminate the inhibitory effect of mBMEC-CM (mw <3 kD) on CFU-GM.BMECs express and secrete Tbeta4 and AcSDKP. Tbeta4 exists in the 3-10 kD component of mBMEC-CM, while AcSDKP exists in the <3 kD component of ECCM. Both components exert inhibitory effects on the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors.",

    "80": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve long-term survival in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction, but their mechanism of action is not entirely clear. The neurohormonal effects may be important in this respect, as well as an early hemodynamic unloading induced by these drugs. The primary objective was to assess the effect of trandolapril on plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide. A secondary objective was to assess the effects of trandolapril on selected neurohormones, vasoactive peptides and enzymes, which may be important in the development of left ventricular remodeling and heart failure following an acute myocardial infarction. A total of 119 patients with an acute myocardial infarction and a wall motion index < or =1.2 (16-segment echocardiographic model) were randomized to double blind treatment with trandolapril or placebo within 3-7 days after the onset of infarction. Blind treatment was discontinued 21 days after the index infarction. Venous blood samples were collected at rest, before randomization and on the day after treatment was discontinued. At the end of the study, there were no differences in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide between the two treatment groups. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was suppressed and plasma renin activity was higher in the trandolapril group. No differences in plasma levels of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, vasopressin, big endothelin-1 and neuropeptide Y were found between the two treatment groups. There were positive correlations between several markers of neurohormonal activation at baseline and variables expressing left ventricular dysfunction and clinical heart failure. Neurohormonal activation is related to left ventricular dysfunction. The effects of 2-3 weeks of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on neurohormonal activation does not predict the already established beneficial long-term effects after myocardial infarction. Thus, early modulation of circulatory neurohormone levels may not be a major mechanism for the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in these patients.

    "81": "There have been many studies concerning the hemodynamics and physiological mechanisms in ischemic heart disease, little is known about molecular mechanisms during myocardial ischemia in in vivo study. As the signal transduction pathway responsible for myocardial hypertrophy and apoptosis, janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) are suggested to play an important role. However, whether in vivo activation of JAK-STAT pathway occurs during myocardial ischemia is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether myocardial JAK or STAT is activated in ischemic heart, and to evaluate the angiotensin blockade on the pathway. Myocardial infarction was produced by ligation of the coronary artery in Wistar rats. After myocardial ischemia, we analysed both activated levels and total amounts of JAK1, JAK2, STAT1 and STAT3 by Western blot analyses at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min. Compared with JAK activities at 0 min, JAK1 activities were significantly increased at 60 and 120 min (3.0- and 3.7-fold, respectively, P<0.01). JAK2 and STAT1 activities of ischemic myocardium were unchanged through the time course. STAT3 activities were increased at 5 min (3.3-fold, P<0.01) and markedly enhanced at 30, 60 and 120 min (4.6-, 7.7- and 8.7-fold, respectively, P<0.01). Pretreatment with imidapril (ACE inhibitor) and candesartan cilexitil (AT1 receptor antagonist) significantly prevented the increase in the phosphorylation of JAK1 at 120 min and STAT3 at 30 and 120 min. Sis-inducing factor (SIF) DNA complex was supershifted by specific anti-STAT3 antibody, indicating that increased SIF complex at least contained activated STAT3 proteins in ischemic myocardium. Imidapril and candesartan cilexitil inhibited the activation of SIF DNA binding at 1 day after coronary ligation. In conclusion, we showed that JAK1 and STAT3 were activated by ischemia from the basal activities in in vivo rat myocardial ischemia model. Imidapril and candesartan cilexitil prevented the increase in phosphorylated JAK1 and STAT3, thereby suggesting that angiotensin II, especially angiotensin II type I receptor, partially mediates activation of myocardial JAK-STAT pathway in acute myocardial ischemia.",

Therefore, our objective was to determine the long-term development of cardiac risk factors, recurrent clinical events, and cardiac medication in patients undergoing routine in hospital cardiac rehabilitation therapy.", 
    "83": "In the prospective PIN Study (Post Infarct Care), 2441 consecutive patients (78% men, 60+/-10 years, 22% women, 65+/-10 years) were enrolled in 18 inpatient rehabilitation centres in Germany following myocardial infarction (56%), coronary artery bypass graft (38%) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (6%). Cardiac risk factors, pre-specified clinical end-points, and the prescription of cardiac medication were prospectively documented on admission to and at discharge from rehabilitation therapy, and 3, 6 and 12 months later by obtaining information with standardized questionnaires from the patients and their physicians. The cardiac risk factors improved initially during cardiac rehabilitation therapy, but deteriorated within the following 12 months: 39% patients smoked at the beginning vs 5% at the end of in hospital rehabilitation vs 10% at 12 months follow-up (P<0.001). The respective numbers for patients with blood pressure >140 and/or 90 mmHg were 24 vs 8 vs 25% (P<0.01) and with plasma cholesterol >200 mg. dl(-1)57 vs 29 vs 51% (P<0.01). A total of 886 patients experienced one or more recurrent clinical events during the first year, 69% of those within the initial 6 months.

    "85": "Serum collected from unilaterally clipped and unclipped rats before and after treatment with water, garlic or cilazapril and subsequent to measuring blood pressure was assayed for thromboxane-B2 and prostaglandin-E2. The unclipped rats' thromboxane-B2 and prostaglandin-E2 levels were about 23 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml, respectively, and blood pressure was 126+/-3 mmHg. These values were not affected by either water or garlic administration. The clipped rats' thromboxane-B2 and prostaglandin-E2 concentrations were close to 34 ng/ml and 4 ng/ml, respectively, and declined only in response to garlic (by 15 ng/ml and 3 ng/ml) and cilazapril (by 12 ng/ml and 1.5 ng/ml). The blood pressure of these rats was 196+/-7 mmHg and again was reduced only by garlic to 169+/-14 mmHg and cilazapril to 137+/-5 mmHg. The no-treatment and water-treatment readings were significantly higher in the clipped rats. The data suggest that prostanoid system activity in the 2-kidney 1-clip rat is enhanced and mostly toward maintaining the hypertension. Furthermore, the blood pressure lowering effects of garlic and cilazapril might have been induced partially by a greater reduction in the synthesis of vasoconstrictor prostanoids.",

There have been a few case reports of hyperkalaemia caused by renal failure, trauma, and drugs where the presentation has been with muscle weakness. A case of hyperkalaemic paralysis caused by an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is reported.", 
    "87": "Chronic azotemic renovascular disease is common in patients with atherosclerosis. Its prevalence appears to be increasing in the aging population. How often it is the primary cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is not yet certain. Some studies suggest that 10%-40% of elderly hypertensive patients with newly documented ESRD and no demonstrable primary renal disease have significant renal artery stenosis (RAS). Atherosclerotic vascular occlusive disease of the renal arteries does progress, but current rates of progression and occlusion are lower than those reported a decade ago. Methods of identifying patients whose renal function is at true risk from vascular occlusive disease and determining who will benefit from intervention remain elusive. The presence of RAS in an azotemic patient can be assessed with noninvasive and risk-free radiologic techniques, including Duplex doppler velicometry and magnetic resonance angiography. Functional tests that predict the change in renal function after revascularization are not yet available. However, a renal length of greater than 7.5 cm in the absence of renal cysts and a short history of renal functional deterioration indicate a good prognosis. Patients with recent deterioration in renal function, those with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a single functioning kidney, those with flash pulmonary edema, advanced chronic renal failure, or ESRD (who have much to gain), those with reversible azotemia during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) therapy, and those whose conditions cannot be managed medically should be considered for revascularization. Results from recent controlled clinical trials of the response to percutaneous transluminal renal artery angioplasty (PTRA) and stenting indicate that improvement in blood pressure control or renal function is not a predictable outcome of renal revascularization. In azotemic groups, 25%-30% of patients achieve important recovery of renal function. Thus, significant progress has been made recently in determining whether RAS is a frequent, treatable cause of renal failure. The decision to recommend revascularization remains a difficult balance between the risks and expense of the procedure and the undoubted benefits that accrue if renal function is successfully stabilized.", 
    "88": "The main etiology for mortality and a great percent of morbidity in patients with diabetes mellitus is atherosclerosis. A hypothesis for the initial lesion of atherosclerosis is endothelial dysfunction, defined pragmatically as changes in the concentration of the chemical messengers produced by the endothelial cell and/or by blunting of the nitric oxide-dependent vasodilatory response to acetylcholine or hyperemia. Endothelial dysfunction has been documented in patients with diabetes and in individuals with insulin resistance or at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Factors associated with endothelial dysfunction in diabetes include activation of protein kinase C, overexpression of growth factors and/or cytokines, and oxidative stress. Several therapeutic interventions have been tested in clinical trials aimed at improving endothelial function in patients with diabetes. Insulin sensitizers may have a beneficial effect in the short term, but the virtual absence of trials with cardiovascular end-points preclude any definitive conclusion. Two trials offer optimism that treatment with ACE inhibitors may have a positive impact on the progression of atherosclerosis. Although widely used, the effect of hypolipidemic agents on endothelial function in diabetes is not clear. The role of antioxidant therapy is controversial. No data have been published regarding the effects of hormonal replacement therapy on endothelial dysfunction in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "89": "1. Recent studies demonstrated that the cardiac calpain system is activated during ischaemic events and is involved in cardiomyocyte injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of AT(1) and AT(2) receptors in the regulation of calpain-mediated myocardial damage following myocardial infarction (MI). 2. Infarcted animals were treated either with placebo, the ACE inhibitor ramipril (1 mg kg(-1) d(-1)), the AT(1) receptor antagonist valsartan (10 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) or the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD 123319 (30 mg kg(-1) d(-1)). Treatment was started 7 days prior to surgery. On day 1, 3, 7 and 14 after MI, gene expression and protein levels of calpain I, II and calpastatin were determined in left ventricular free wall (LVFW) and interventricular septum (IS). At day 3 and 14 post MI, morphological investigations were performed. 3. Calpain I mRNA expression and protein levels were increased in IS 14 days post MI, whereas mRNA expression and protein levels of calpain II were maximally increased in LVFW 3 days post MI. Ramipril and valsartan decreased mRNA and protein up-regulation of calpain I and II, and reduced infarct size and interstitial fibrosis. PD 123319 did not affect calpain I or II up-regulation in the infarcted myocardium, but decreased interstitial fibrosis. Calpastatin expression and translation were not affected by AT receptor antagonists or ACE inhibitor. 4. Our data demonstrate a distinct, temporary-spatial up-regulation of calpain I and II following MI confer with the hypothesis of calpain I being involved in cardiac remodelling in the late and calpain II contributing to cardiac tissue damage in the early phase of MI. The up-regulation of calpain I and II is partly mediated via the AT(1) receptor and can be reduced by ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists.", 
    "90": "The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent endothelium-specific angiogenic factor, in the regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was studied. VEGF (0.07-1.2 x 10(-6) mmol/l) caused a dose-dependent increase in ACE measured in intact endothelial cells and increased the expression of ACE mRNA. The stimulatory effect of VEGF was inhibited by pretreatment of endothelial cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin (4.35 x 10(-5) mmol/l). The stimulatory effect of VEGF was potentiated by the selective cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast (0.1 mmol/l). The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 5.4 mmol/l) suppressed the stimulatory effect of VEGF. The nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (5 microM) and the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (5 microM) potentiated the stimulatory effect of VEGF, whereas the selective COX-1 inhibitor resveratrol (5 microM) was without effect. ACE induction by VEGF was inhibited by the selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203X (2.5 x 10(-3) mmol/l) and by downregulating PKC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. In summary, VEGF induced ACE in cultured HUVECs. Intracellular events such as tyrosine kinase activation, PKC activation, and increase of cGMP were probably involved in ACE induction by VEGF. Nitric oxide may partially contribute to ACE induction by VEGF. The powerful capacity of VEGF to increase ACE in endothelial cells shown here suggests a synergistic relation between VEGF and the renin-angiotensin system in vascular biology and pathophysiology.", 
    "91": "Terminal renal failure is the final common fate of chronic nephropathies regardless of the type of original insult. After removal of a critical number of nephrons, adaptive hemodynamic changes in the remaining nephrons ensure enough filtration power to the kidney but are ultimately detrimental. Such changes are largely mediated by the local formation of angiotensin II (AII) and prevented by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which also limit the forced opening of large unselective pores in the glomerular barrier, restoring size selectivity. Recent studies suggested that proteins filtered through the glomerular capillary, previously considered a marker of the severity of renal lesions, might have intrinsic toxicity on the proximal tubular cells and a contributory role in the progression of renal damage. Protein overload of proximal tubular cells induced the secretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) that was mainly directed toward the basolateral compartment of the cell. Evidence available in rat models of proteinuric renal disease shows that expression of genes encoding such vasoactive and proinflammatory molecules as ET-1, MCP-1, and RANTES was consistently upregulated, and synthesis of the corresponding peptides was enhanced in renal tissue. Additional mechanisms of proximal tubular cell activation leading to interstitial inflammation and matrix deposition are the filtration of protein-bound metals and hormones and deposition and activation of filtered complement. Limiting protein traffic and the biological effect of excessive tubular protein reabsorption by drugs interfering with AII synthesis or biological activity prevents renal disease progression.", 
    "92": "Numerous studies have shown a correlation between the degree of proteinuria and rate of progression of renal failure. This has led to the hypothesis that proteinuria may be an independent mediator of progression, rather than simply a marker of glomerular dysfunction. The mechanisms by which the presence of proteins in tubular fluid may promote the progression of chronic renal failure are not yet determined. However, the observation that proximal tubular cells reabsorb proteins from the tubular fluid has led to the suggestion that proteins or associated molecules may adversely affect tubular cell biological state. In this regard, it is of note that tubulointerstitial disease correlates better with the level of renal function than changes in the glomerulus. Further support for this hypothesis comes from the observations that strategies that reduce proteinuria, including control of hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and low-protein diets, reduce the rate of progression of renal failure.", 
    "93": "The clear-cut and detailed pathogenesis of diabetic renal disease is not yet elucidated, but it is clear that both initiation and progression of renal disease in diabetes is related to glycemic control and blood pressure (BP) regulation, also seen in intervention studies. Consequently, optimal control of glycemia and antihypertensive treatment have become the cornerstones in the management of patients with diabetes. Naturally, modulating factors need to be discussed in further detail. The genetics of diabetes and its renal complications are still very complex issues that need to be explored further. Few and inconclusive data are available with respect to clinical management, for which genotyping is not required. Dietary protein content has long been an interesting avenue for possible treatment, but to date, data from patients with nondiabetic renal disease and with diabetes are not totally convincing, although further results may be published very soon. The issue is also complex because a low-protein diet may increase BP according to new studies, rendering the issue of low-protein content in the diet still more complex and controversial. Metabolic issues remain a key question, specifically with regard to glycemic control, in which data have accumulated over the past decade from epidemiological and interventional studies. There is no doubt that optimal glycemic control is crucial, but issues regarding specific glucose-related mechanisms and protein and lipid metabolism are still under investigation. The renin-angiotensin system has emerged as a key issue in diabetes, especially with regard to its inhibition by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin-receptor blockade. New studies suggest that more complete inhibition of this system by dual blockade may be an avenue for further study according to positive results in patients with microalbuminuric type 2 diabetes, who are at great risk. Antihypertensive treatment still remains a fundamental component, although the metabolic effects of some antihypertensive agents may be important, especially with respect to diuretics, ss-blockers, and possibly alpha-blockers. The situation becomes complex with the frequent combination of various agents in the treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes. Conversely, ACE inhibitors may have some diabetes-protective effect, but further studies are needed.",

Successful implementation of these strategies will require intensive physician and patient education and development of innovative approaches to fund support services.", 
    "113": "Patients with decompensated congestive heart failure can be categorized into those with either acute or chronic presentations. Patients with acute decompensated heart failure most often have an acute injury that affects either myocardial performance (i.e., myocardial infarction) or valvular/chamber integrity (mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture), which leads to an acute rise in left ventricular (LV) filling pressures resulting in pulmonary edema and dyspnea. Therapy for these patients is aimed at treating the underlying cause of the myocardial injury as well as pharmacologic strategies to reduce LV filling pressures and to improve cardiac performance. In contrast, the therapy of patients presenting with decompensated heart failure in the setting of chronic LV systolic dysfunction, treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, diuretics, and may be beta blockers, represent a poorly defined clinical entity that lacks clear guidelines for treatment. These patients can present with symptoms of volume overload and/or low cardiac output without evidence for a volume overloaded state. Potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches include (1) a pulmonary artery catheter for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, (2) intravenous inotropic therapy, (3) LV mechanical assist device therapy, and (4) cardiac transplantation.

The significance of infarct size in regard to the response to ACEIs, however, is controversial. This study aimed to analyze the effects of lisinopril on mortality rate, cardiac function, degree of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in rats with different infarct sizes. METHODS - Lisinopril (20 mg/kg/day) dissolved in drinking water was administered to rats immediately after coronary artery occlusion. After being sacrificed, the infarcted animals were divided into two groups: one group of animals with small infarcts (< 40% of the left ventricle) and another group of animals with large infarcts (> 40% of the left ventricle). RESULTS - The mortality rate was 31.7% in treated rats and 47% in the untreated rats. There was no statistical difference between the groups with small and large infarcts in regard to myocardial concentration of hydroxyproline. In small infarcts, the treatment attenuated the heart dysfunction characterized by lower levels of blood pressure and lower values of the first derivative of pressure and of the negative derivative of pressure. The degree of hypertrophy was also attenuated in small infarcts. In regard to large infarcts, no differences between the groups were observed. CONCLUSION - Treatment with the ACEIs had no effect on mortality rate and on the amount of fibrosis. The protective effect of lisinopril on heart function and on the degree of hypertrophy could only be detected in small infarcts",

    "119": "The healthy term, and particularly the premature infant, is born with a very low glomerular filtration rate (GFR), controlled by a delicate balance of intrarenal vasoconstrictor and vasodilator forces. Vasoactive disturbances can easily further reduce the already low GFR. The newborn infant is thus prone to develop vasomotor nephropathy (VMNP) or acute renal failure (ARF). The main causes for ARF at this young age are prerenal mechanisms, and include hypotension, hypovolemia, hypoxemia perinatal asphyxia, and neonatal septicemia. Other causes include the administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, indomethacin and tolazoline. The most-important factors governing the ultimate renal prognosis are the severity of the underlying disorder, the rapidity of an accurate diagnosis, prompt treatment, and avoidance of severe iatrogenic complications. The immediate treatment is of particular importance in VMNP, i.e., prerenal ischemic ARF, and consists of correcting abnormalities in fluid homeostasis and reduction of the complications of the acute azotemic state (uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and hypertension). In severe and prolonged (established) ARF, temporary dialysis therapy may be indicated. Prerenal ARF with oliguria or anuria warrants immediate volume resuscitation. Special attention should be given to infants with congestive heart failure (CHF). The sick neonate with persistent oliguria and CHF should be treated with intravenous dopamine. Furosemide (FM) is the second line of therapy for babies with indomethacin-induced ARF. In most other conditions, the therapeutic effect of FM is limited to a transient increase in urine flow, without improving basic renal function. The special conditions of the maturing kidney have to be appreciated in order to protect babies from undue renal injury. With the increasing knowledge of the mechanisms governing the development of ARF, progress has been made in the development of new treatment modalities. For example theophylline, calcium antagonists, ATP-MgCl2, thyroxine, and a variety of cytokines may in the near future be used to prevent or ameliorate VMNP and/or recently established ARF. With a combination of time-honored and new therapeutic strategies, there may well be a brighter future for neonates with vasomotor, prerenal, ischemic ARF.",

The ACE inhibitors improve endothelial function and regress both left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial mass better than other antihypertensive agents that lower blood pressure equally as well. These agents promote collateral vessel development and improve prognosis in patients who have had a coronary revascularization procedure (i.e., percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Insulin resistance, present not only in type 2 diabetes but also commonly in patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease, or both, sensitizes the vasculature to the trophic effects of angiotensin II and aldosterone. This may partly explain the improvement in prognosis noted when patients who have atherosclerosis or diabetes are treated with an ACE inhibitor. Therapy with ACE inhibitors has also been shown, in two large, randomized trials, to reduce the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes through largely unknown mechanisms. The ACE inhibitors are safe, well tolerated and affordable medications. The data suggest that most people with atherosclerosis should be considered candidates for ACE inhibitor therapy, unless they are intolerant to the medication, or have systolic blood pressures consistently <100 mm Hg. Patients who show evidence of insulin resistance (with or without overt type 2 diabetes) should also be considered as candidates for prophylactic ACE inhibitor therapy. Although angiotensin receptor blockers should not be considered equivalent to ACE inhibitors for this indication, they may be a reasonable alternative for patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors.",

    "142": "In culture, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) derived from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) show exaggerated growth compared with cells from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. SHR-derived VSMC express higher levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNAs than cells from WKY rats. We have recently observed production of angiotensin II (Ang II) in homogeneous cultures of VSMC from SHR. In the current study we investigated the contribution of endogenous Ang II to increased expression of the above-mentioned growth factors in VSMC from SHR. The levels of mRNAs encoding TGF-beta1, PDGF A-chain, and bFGF were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and were much higher in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY rats. The basal level of Ang II-like immunoreactivity (LI) in conditioned medium as determined by radioimmunoassay was significantly higher in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY rats. Isoproterenol is known to induce angiotensinogen gene significantly increased Ang II-LI in VSMC from both WKY rats and SHR. Isoproterenol also increased angiotensinogen, TGF-beta1, PDGF A-chain, and bFGF mRNAs in VSMC from SHR. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor delapril significantly decreased Ang II-LI in VSMC from WKY rats and SHR. Delapril considerably decreased the levels of TGF-beta1, PDGF A-chain, and bFGF mRNAs in VSMC from SHR. An Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist CV 11974 decreased the levels of TGF-beta1, PDGF A-chain, and bFGF mRNAs, and the levels of TGF-beta1, PDGF-AA, and bFGF proteins in VSMC from SHR. These findings suggest that increased generation of Ang II is associated with enhanced expression of TGF-beta1, PDGF A-chain, and bFGF, and the increases in the levels of these growth factors by endogenous Ang II may contribute to the exaggerated growth of VSMC from SHR.", 
    "143": "Oxygen radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be generated in large amounts under inflammatory conditions and in the first few minutes of postischemic organ reperfusion. Due to the interaction of ROS with nitric oxide (NO), formed constitutively by endothelial cells, two alternatives are feasible. On the one hand, reaction with superoxide radicals may induce toxification (formation of peroxynitrite), and, on the other hand, by reacting with superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, NO can serve as a radical scavenger (formation of the innocuous anions, nitrate and nitrite, respectively). However, NO is considered to play a pivotal role in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, with effects arising from both lack and surfeit of this easily diffusible and chemically very reactive molecule. Physiologic contributions to vascular dilatation and inhibition of platelet and leukocyte activation, e.g., are infringed by enhanced inactivation of NO. Such inactivation occurs readily due to spontaneous reaction of NO with the superoxide radical, formed, e.g., by stressed endothelial cells and activated leukocytes. Conversely, overproduction of NO by induced NO synthase (iNOS) may lead to circulatory shock, cell apoptosis or even cell necrosis. Caution would, thus, seem to be warranted when attempting to interfere with homeostasis of NO. We have investigated the ability of NO to act as a radical scavenger during myocardial reperfusion in experimental and clinical settings. In the former, inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme was employed to generate more endogenous NO (via bradykinin), in the latter, low-dose sodium nitroprusside was used as the donor of exogenous NO in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting. Inhibition of leukocyte adhesion, attenuation of platelet activation and mitigation of redox-stress and inflammation were observed in both instances. Accordingly, modest enhancement of NO levels should afford cardioprotection during reperfusion.", 
    "144": "Allograft coronary endothelial cells can serve as potent stimulators (antigen-presenting cells) as well as targets of allogeneic lymphocyte reactivity. Independent of the cause leading to endothelial cell injury after transplantation, endothelial cell activation and dysfunction occurs, associated with modification in endothelial cell-dependent molecule expression. The prevalence of coronary endothelial vasomotor dysfunction is approximately 20-30% during the first year, and 30-40% in the long-term follow-up. Importantly, no association is detectable between endothelial dysfunction and intimal thickness, suggesting two distinct entities of allograft vasculopathy. Early predictors of vasomotor dysfunction are proinflammatory cytokines and endothelin expression. Repetitive subendocardial ischemia during myocardial stress (due to microvascular dysfunction) may result in an impairment of left ventricular function. In non-transplant patients coronary endothelial dysfunction predicts cardiac events during long-term follow-up. It is reasonable that early administration of endothelial-protective compounds is necessary for protection of allograft endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy during follow-up. The explanted donor heart may offer a potential for gene therapy techniques including modification of allograft phenotype and modulation of the host alloimmune response. Other protective strategies may include improvement of cardioplegic solutions and reperfusion strategies, recovery of the imbalance between vasoactive mediators, and treatment with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors and/or ACE inhibitors.", 
    "145": "Bradykinin has been reported to act as a growth factor for fibroblasts, mesangial cells and keratinocytes. Recently, we reported that bradykinin augments liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is also a powerful bradykinin-degrading enzyme. We have investigated the effect of ACE inhibition by lisinopril on liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Adult male Wistar rats underwent 70% partial hepatectomy (PH). The animals received lisinopril at a dose of 1 mg kg body weight(-1) day(-1), or saline solution, intraperitoneally, for 5 days before hepatectomy, and daily after surgery. Four to six animals from the lisinopril and saline groups were sacrificed at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 120 h after PH. Liver regeneration was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen using the PC-10 monoclonal antibody. The value for the lisinopril-treated group was three-fold above the corresponding control at 12 h after PH (P<0.001), remaining elevated at approximately two-fold above control values at 24, 36, 48 (P<0.001), and at 72 h (P<0.01) after PH, but values did not reach statistical difference at 120 h after PH. Plasma ACE activity measured by radioenzymatic assay was significantly higher in the saline group than in the lisinopril-treated group (P<0.001), with 81% ACE inhibition. The present study shows that plasma ACE inhibition enhances liver regeneration after PH in rats. Since it was reported that bradykinin also augments liver regeneration after PH, this may explain the liver growth stimulating effect of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "146": "Studies have shown that high levels of glucose and angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulate hypertrophy and the expression of matrix protein genes in mouse proximal tubular cells in vitro. The present study tested the hypothesis that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibits the stimulatory effect of high levels of glucose on the expression of the renal angiotensinogen (ANG) gene and the formation of Ang II and subsequently attenuates the induction of hypertrophy in kidney proximal tubular cells. Immortalized rat proximal tubular cells (IRPTC) were cultured in monolayer. The levels of expression of rat ANG and ANG mRNA in the IRPTC were quantified by specific radioimmunoassays for rat ANG (RIA-rANG) and by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, respectively. Hypertrophy of IRPTC was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan) and cellular protein assay. Our studies showed that losartan (an Ang II (AT(1))-receptor blocker), perindopril and captopril (inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme) blocked the stimulatory effect of a high level of glucose (i.e. 25 mM) on the expression of the rat ANG gene and hypertrophy in IRPTC but not by the Ang II (AT(2))-receptor blocker. Our studies indicate that the blockade of RAS is effective in inhibiting the stimulatory effect of hyperglycemia on the expression of the ANG gene and hypertrophy in IRPTC, supporting the notion that the local formation of intrarenal Ang II may play a role in the development of renal hypertrophy during early diabetes.", 
    "147": "In experimental animals, kinins protect the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion injuries and reduce left ventricular hypertrophy and progression of heart failure. This suggests that in humans, also, the presence of an intact kinin system is critical for the prevention of heart failure. In addition to the kinin-generating system, the concentration of kinins, and consequently the extent of their actions, is regulated by their degradation. In the vascular bed of the human heart, bradykinin (BK) is degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In contrast, in the interstitium of the human heart, BK is degraded by neutral endopeptidase (NEP). For potentiating the beneficial effects of BK, one strategy is elevation of the BK concentration by inhibition of BK-degrading enzymes. An even more effective form of pharmacological control of BK elevation than inhibition of ACE alone might be the combined inhibition of ACE and NEP.",

After 3 months, the cardiac parameters studied were: mortality, fibrosis (hydroxyproline), hypertrophy (ventricular weight/body weight ratio [VW/BW]), left ventricular enlargement (volume at end-diastolic pressure equaled zero/body weight ratio [V0/BW]), and ventricular function (isovolumetric developed pressure, dp/dt, -dp/dt). A lowest mortality rate in the animals treated with the combination of both ACE inhibitor and AT(1) receptor antagonist was observed. Although lisinopril and losartan significantly decreased VW/BW ratio, when administered concomitantly, VW/BW ratio was lower than when either agent was administered individually. There were no differences in right ventricle hydroxyproline concentration. Only combination therapy decreased V0/BW ratio. The treatment with lisinopril plus losartan resulted in increases in the development of pressure versus untreated group; without alteration in dp/dt and -dp/dt.",

We determined the differential effects of the ACE inhibitor quinapril and the AT1 receptor blocker losartan on arterial thrombus formation in the rat. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed regular chow or chow mixed with low-dose quinapril (0. 6 mg/kg/day), high-dose quinapril (1.2 mg/kg/day), or losartan (10 mg/kg/day) for 15 days. Abdominal aorta was exposed and wrapped with Whatman paper impregnated with 29% FeCl(3) (ferric chloride). Time to occlusive thrombus formation and weight of the thrombus were recorded. Aortic superoxide anion generation, platelet aggregation, plasma angiotensin II levels, and morphology of the thrombus were also examined. Both losartan and quinapril caused similar reductions in arterial pressure. Losartan did not affect the time to thrombus formation, whereas quinapril (both low and high doses) delayed the time to thrombus formation (P<.01 vs control). Weight of the thrombus was similar in all groups of rats. Platelet aggregation was inhibited by approximately 50 in both quinapril- and losartan-treated rats. The high-dose quinapril-treated rats showed markedly reduced vascular superoxide anion generation compared with the control rats (P<.05). Plasma angiotensin II levels were unaffected by quinapril treatment but were elevated 7-fold in losartan-treated rats (P <.001 vs. control rats). The thrombi in the control rats consisted of platelet aggregates, fibrin, and red blood cells. The intravascular platelet aggregates were much smaller in the quinapril-treated rats (P<.05 vs. control), but were similar in control and losartan-treated rats. In conclusion, quinapril but not losartan prolongs time to arterial thrombus formation and results in smaller platelet aggregates in the thrombus. Both quinapril and losartan decrease platelet aggregation, but only quinapril decreases superoxide anion generation. This effect on superoxide anion generation as well as mechanisms other than AT1 receptor blockade may underlie the salutary effect of quinapril on arterial thrombogenesis.",

Medical record review and a telephone interview of consenting survivors were used to collect information on risk factors for stroke. Computerized pharmacy records were used to assess antihypertensive drug use.", 
    "175": "Among 1237 single-drug users with no history of cardiovascular disease, the adjusted risk of ischemic stroke was higher among users of a beta-blocker (risk ratio [RR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-3.94), calcium channel blocker (RR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.16-4.56), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (RR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.47-5. 27) than among users of a thiazide diuretic alone. Among 673 single-drug users with a history of cardiovascular disease, the RRs were 1.22 (95% CI, 0.63-2.35), 1.18 (95% CI, 0.59-2.33), and 1.45 (95% CI, 0.70-3.02) among users of a beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, respectively, compared with users of a thiazide diuretic alone.", 
    "176": "In this study of pharmacologically treated hypertensive patients, antihypertensive drug regimens that did not include a thiazide diuretic were associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with regimens that did include a thiazide. These results support the use of thiazide diuretics as first-line antihypertensive agents.", 
    "177": "Deformation-induced endothelin-1 synthesis in endothelial cells may contribute to the intimal hyperplasia of venous bypass grafts. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists are capable of reducing vein graft disease. Therefore, the effects of these drugs on endothelial preproendothelin-1 (ppET-1) and smooth muscle endothelin B receptor (ET(B)-R) expression were investigated in isolated perfused segments of the rabbit jugular vein. Pretreatment with ramiprilat (0.3 micromol/L) or irbesartan (0.01 to 1 micromol/L) had no effect on basal ppET-1 or ET(B)-R expression but markedly attenuated the deformation-induced expression of these gene products, and these effects were reversed by the B(2) receptor antagonist icatibant (Hoe 140) and by the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine. Candesartan (1 micromol/L) mimicked the inhibitory effect of irbesartan. Moreover, reporter gene analysis with a rat ppET-1 promoter-luciferase construct transiently transfected into porcine aortic cultured endothelial cells revealed that the inhibitory effect of both ramiprilat and irbesartan on deformation-induced ppET-1 expression is species independent and mediated at the level of transcription. In addition, RT-PCR analysis detected only AT(1) receptor expression in the endothelium-intact rabbit jugular vein, and neither irbesartan nor ramiprilat affected endothelial NO synthase expression. Thus, ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists are capable of suppressing deformation-induced gene expression in the vessel wall in both an autocrine (ppET-1) and a paracrine (ET(B)-R) manner via a common mechanism of action that constitutes a B(2) receptor-mediated increase in endothelial NO release.", 
    "178": "Increased plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) occur with congestive heart failure (CHF), but the components of the enzymatic activation of ET-1 in the myocardium remain to be defined. Accordingly, endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) activity and expression in normal and failing heart were examined.", 
    "179": "Left ventricular (LV) tissue samples were obtained from patients undergoing heart transplantation because of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and from normal donor hearts. The gene expression of ET-1 precursor and ECE-1a was upregulated 4- and 3-fold, respectively, in the failing heart. ECE-1 activity (fmol/mg protein per hour) was augmented from 2,291+/-257 in normal tissue samples to 5,507+/-666 in DCM samples and to 7,435+/-682 in ICM samples (P < .05). Phosphoramidon and a specific ECE-1 inhibitor, FR901533, inhibited ECE-1 activity by over 90%. However, inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (thiorphan) and matrix metalloproteases (batimistat) did not affect the conversion of big ET-1 to ET-1.", 
    "180": "This study showed that the biosynthetic pathway of ET-1 is activated in LV myocardium in the failing heart, and the myocardial processing of big ET-1 is highly specific for ECE-1.", 
    "181": "Experiments were carried out to examine whether endogenous angiotensin II (A-II) is involved in the regulation of release of norepinephrine (NE) elicited by the stimulation of spinal sympathetic nerves in pithed rats. It was assessed in terms of the alterations in concentrations of arterial blood plasma A-II and NE elicited by nerve stimulation (5 Hz, 50 V, 1 msec for 45 s) in pithed rats under vehicle or captopril (3 mg/kg, i.v.) treatment. Comparative study with pentobarbital anesthetized rats showed that pithing rats have the characteristics of lower basal blood pressure and lower NE level, whereas they have higher basal A-II level. In pithed rats treated with vehicle, pressor response to nerve stimulation was accompanied by increases in both A-II and NE level. In rats treated with captopril, the nerve stimulation caused about 40% lower increases in pressor response and NE level than those observed in rats treated with vehicle. These results suggest that the sympathetic nerve-induced NE release is facilitated by endogenous A-II in pithed rats, and that captopril exerts its inhibitory effect on the pressor response to nerve stimulation through the suppression of this interaction.", 
    "182": "The pathway of dehydration and intramolecular cyclization of lisinopril dihydrate in the solid state was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a combination of thermal analyzer with Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (thermal FT-IR microscopic system). The results indicate that the dehydration from the solid-state lisinopril dihydrate had a two-step process from dihydrate to monohydrate at 76 degrees C and then from monohydrate to anhydrate at 99-101 approximately C, which could be clearly observed from the above three methods. Only the thermal FT-IR microscopic system could give vital information on diketopiperazine (DKP) formation via intramolecular cyclization in anhydrous lisinopril. A new peak at 1670 cm(-1) assigned to the carbonyl band of DKP formation was clearly evidenced. The water of reaction byproduct was liberated at a temperature >157 degrees C and appeared on the IR spectra near 3200-3400 cm(-1). Moreover, the peak at 1574 cm(-1) assigned to carboxylate shifted to 1552 cm(-1) due to the DKP formation. The peak at 1670 cm(-1) related to the DKP formation changed slightly in intensity from 147 degrees C and significantly near 157 degrees C. DSC and TGA methods were poor for use in supplying information on DKP formation in lisinopril. The thermal FT-IR microscopic system is useful from the view point that it can quickly and directly show the solid-state stability of drug.", 
    "183": "Zofenopril is a pro-drug designed to undergo metabolic hydrolysis yielding the active free sulfhydryl compound zofenoprilat, which is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, endowed also with a marked cardioprotective activity. A simple, highly sensitive specific LC-MS-MS method was developed for the determination of zofenopril and zofenoprilat in human plasma. In order to prevent oxidative degradation of zofenoprilat and its internal standard, their free sulfhydryl groups were protected by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which produced the succinimide derivatives. The compounds and their corresponding fluorine derivatives, used as internal standards, were extracted from plasma with toluene. The reconstituted dried extracts were chromatographed and then monitored by a triple-stage-quadrupole instrument operating in the negative ion spray ionization mode. The method was validated over the concentration range of 1-300 ng/ml for zofenopril and 2-600 ng/ml for zofenoprilat. Inter- and intra-assay precision and accuracy of both zofenopril and zofenoprilat were better than 10%. The limit of quantitation was 1 ng/ml with zofenopril and 2 ng/ml with zofenoprilat. Extraction recovery proved to be on average 84.8% with zofenopril and 70.1% with zofenoprilat. Similar recoveries were shown by the above two internal standards. The method was applied to measure plasma concentrations of zofenopril and zofenoprilat in 18 healthy volunteers treated orally with zofenopril calcium salt at the dose of 60 mg.", 
    "184": "Although diabetic nephropathy is a slowly progressing, well studied disease, it is the most common cause of end stage renal disease in industrialized countries. Recently the first randomized controlled long term trials about microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes have been published. Only seven years ago the first hallmark papers about metabolic control and ACE inhibition emerged. This review highlights the current status of prevention and therapy of diabetic nephropathy by metabolic and blood pressure control in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, depending on their stage of nephropathy (normo-, micro-, or macroalbuminuria). In patients with type 1 diabetes and normo- or microalbuminuria, strict metabolic control has been shown to slow the progression of nephropathy. In macroalbuminuric patients an aggressive antihypertensive treatment, preferably with an ACE inhibitor, is more important than the metabolic control. ACE inhibitor therapy has also been proven beneficial in microalbuminuric patients, but not yet in normotensive, non-albuminuric type 1 patients. Because of the high prevalence of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes, a strict antihypertensive treatment is more important than metabolic control for the prevention of progression of microvascular disease. Since most patients need a combination of antihypertensive medications a recommendation for a single substance class can not be given.", 
    "185": "The HOPE study investigated the hypothesis that inhibition of the RAS with the ACE inhibitor, ramipril, prevents cardiovascular events in patients with a high cardiovascular risk. The primary endpoint of the double-blind, placebo-controlled study was the combination of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. The result was a significant reduction in the number of myocardial infarctions (9.9 vs. 12.2%), cardiovascular deaths (6.1 vs. 8.1%), strokes (3.4 vs. 4.9%) and revascularizations (16.0 vs. 18.6%) under the ACE inhibitor. The cough rate was raised (by 5%). The cardio- and nephroprotective benefits of ramipril were largely independent of the reduction in blood pressure achieved by the ACE inhibitor. The effects of rampipril in terms of micro- and macrovascular complications benefitted in particular type 2 diabetics with additional cardiovascular risk factors, so that this group should not be denied ramipril. The level of albumin excretion in the urine is directly coupled with the rate of cardiovascular events.", 
    "186": "Efficacy of four primary classes of antihypertensive agents (diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, adrenergic inhibiting drugs) were compared by using a crossectional medical record survey between July 1997 and January 1998. Only hypertensive cases with initial monotherapy were studied. The evaluations were 1) blood pressure response after drug titration and 2) blood pressure response during the maintenance phase. Two hundred and eighty nine patients were studied. After dose titration, the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure with calcium antagonists (33 +/- 24 mmHg, mean +/- SD) was better than other drugs (p < 0.05) while there was no difference in the other three drug classes in systolic blood pressure reduction. The mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure with calcium antagonists (17 +/- 9 mmHg) was better than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (13 +/- 9, p = 0.02) but without significant difference compared to the other two drug classes. There was no difference in diastolic blood pressure reduction from diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and adrenergic inhibiting drugs. In the maintenance phase, the response rate for calcium antagonists (82.6%) was better than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (54.2%, p = 0.004) but was not better than the other two drug classes. Response rates for diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and adrenergic inhibiting drugs were not statistically different.", 
    "187": "This report presents a 46-year-old man who was treated for hypertension with the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. After 3 years of continuous treatment he presented with jaundice and progressive liver failure that continued despite withdrawal of the medication. The patient was taking no other medication. All known causes of acute liver failure could be excluded indicating a drug-induced liver damage after long-term treatment with enalapril. Analysis of liver biopsies revealed a pathomorphological pattern comparable to than observed in severe halothane hepatitis. Serological studies including T-cell stimulation with enalapril and a broad spectrum of tests for autoimmunity including autoantibodies against calreticulin, the major Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of halothane hepatitis were negative. Thus, the mechanism of enalapril-induced liver injury remains obscure. Liver failure progressed and finally led to orthotopic liver transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the longest duration of chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor before liver failure occurred. In addition, liver failure progressed despite withdrawal of the medication. It is concluded that even after long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor liver failure may be induced. Therefore, regular monitoring of liver enzymes should be considered.",

The influence, after ICD implantation, of concomitant CABG, angioplasty, and other antiischemic therapeutic interventions, like treatment with beta-blockers, on outcome and mortality of patients with VT or VF due to CAD remains uncertain. The univariate and multivariate risks of recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias requiring ICD interventions or death associated with baseline clinical and functional variables were studied in 160 consecutive patients with CAD of whom 30 underwent CABG or angioplasty at < or = 2 weeks before ICD implantation. ICD interventions occurred in 98 (61%) patients over a mean follow-up of 1,065 days. In univariate and multivariate analysis, VT as the presenting arrhythmia was the only clinical factor predictive of recurrences. Treatment with beta-blockers at hospital discharge reduced the probability of recurrences. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed the effect of beta-blockers (P < 0.005) and of VT as the presenting arrhythmia (P < 0.01). Overall mortality was 61% (29/160). In multivariate analysis a low ejection fraction (< or = 0.20) and omission of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at discharge were associated with excess mortality. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, a low ejection fraction (borderline between 0.30 and 0.21, significant < 0.21) was the single predictor of mortality. Revascularization by CABG or angioplasty had no influence on ventricular arrhythmia recurrences or survival. During long-term follow-up, VT as the presenting arrhythmia and the omission of beta-blocker therapy were associated with excess recurrences of ventricular arrhythmias after ICD implantation. In contrast, survival depended primarily on left ventricular function at discharge. Revascularization did not prevent recurrences of arrhythmias and had no significant effect on survival in the small group of patients who underwent CABG or angioplasty.", 
    "197": "There are no clear data regarding whether to use warfarin, aspirin, or no therapy in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Aspirin use is widespread in patients with vascular disease but it can decrease renal blood flow in low output states. Warfarin may be used in patients with advancing heart failure due to the perceived risk of in situ thromboembolism. However, we know that ejection fraction and symptom class do not always match and that the regulation of warfarin dosing is more difficult in worsening heart failure. Drug use must be individualized, based on knowledge of underlying heart failure etiology, functional class, drug side effects, and renal function. We await ongoing studies to elucidate the differential effects of these drugs on global outcome as well as on the mechanisms by which they achieve their results.", 
    "198": "The possible involvement of the local angiotensin system in ganglionic functions was investigated in the canine cardiac sympathetic ganglia. Positive chronotropic responses to preganglionic stellate stimulation at high frequencies, after intravenous administration of pentolinium plus atropine, were inhibited by the nonpeptide angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist forasartan or the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, whereas the rate increases elicited by the postganglionic stellate stimulation and norepinephrine given intravenously failed to be inhibited by these antagonists. The levels of endogenous immunoreactive angiotensin II, as determined by radioimmunoassay in the incubation medium of the stellate and inferior cervical ganglia, were increased after the high-frequency preganglionic stimulation of the isolated ganglia. The increment of the peptide was also antagonized by the pretreatment with captopril but not by a chymase inhibitor, chymostatin. The expression of angiotensinogen mRNA was observed in the stellate ganglion, adrenal, liver, and lung but not in the ovary and spleen. The expression of the mRNA in the stellate and inferior cervical ganglia increased after high-frequency preganglionic stimulation of the in vivo dogs for a period of 1 hour. These results indicate that an intrinsic angiotensin I-converting enzyme-dependent angiotensin system exists in the cardiac sympathetic ganglia, which is activated by high-frequency preganglionic stimulation.", 
    "199": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockade on insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) induced proliferation and immediate-early-gene expression of neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were investigated. Moreover the role of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in this process was evaluated. IGF-I (10(-9) - 10(-7) M) stimulated neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast growth in a dose-dependent fashion (maximum: 3.5+/-0.1 fold, 10(-7) M), as determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. ACE inhibition or AT(1) receptor blockade attenuated the IGF-I (10(-7) M) induced neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast growth in a concentration-dependent fashion (moexiprilat: 50+/-2%, enalaprilat: 31+/-2%, CV11974; 58+/-1%, all: 10(-7) M). IGF-I stimulated cellular growth was accompanied by an upregulation of the immediate early genes c-Fos (2.4+/-0.3 fold), Egr-1 (4.7+/-1.1 fold) and Sp1 (6.2+/-0.7 fold). IGF-I induced expression was completely inhibited by ACE inhibition or AT(1) receptor blockade. Stimulation with IGF-I or Ang II (10(-7) M) increased IGF-IR expression 5.7+/-0. 5 fold and 3.6+/-0.5 fold respectively. The IGF-I induced overexpression of the IGF-IR was reduced by ACE inhibition with moexiprilat (10(-7) M) by 79+/-7% and by AT(1) receptor blockade with CV11974 (10(-7) M) by 79+/-5%. These data demonstrate that the mitogenic action of IGF-I in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts is in part mediated by activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with subsequent upregulation of IGF-IR expression. This observation has important implications for the treatment of cardiac diseases with ACE inhibitors alone and their combination with IGF-I or growth hormone.", 
    "200": "Many important developments recently have been made in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) in postmenopausal women. Substantial evidence supports focusing on comprehensive risk factor modification based on the \"ABCs\" of CAD management from the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine guidelines on chronic stable angina. This approach emphasizes cardiovascular risk factor interventions that include antiplatelet agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, cholesterol-lowering medications, diabetes control, and counseling on diet and exercise. Despite the expanding available literature, many questions on CAD in postmenopausal women remain unanswered and await the publication of ongoing and future research. The unexpected findings from the HERS (Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study) failed to show a benefit of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in reducing the risk of subsequent events in postmenopausal women with CAD, and instead reported an early increase in CAD events. Based on the data available so far, we advise against starting HRT in postmenopausal women with a recent coronary event for the sole purpose of CAD prevention. For women with acute coronary syndromes, prompt angiography and revascularization should be considered.", 
    "201": "Because the transplanted heart is denervated, classic angina as a symptom of allograft coronary vasculopathy rarely is perceived. Any cardiac transplant patients who presents with decreased exercise capacity, shortness of breath, or syncope should be assessed thoroughly. Unfortunately, the initial presenting symptom of transplant vasculopathy may be acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or even sudden death. Patients should be evaluated on an annual basis for the presence of transplant coronary vasculopathy in addition to when clinical suspicion warrants. Coronary angiography has been the main modality of invasive assessment, although it is insensitive. Recently, intracoronary ultrasound has been used in conjunction with angiography to detect the first evidence of transplant vasculopathy, manifested as thickening of the intimal layer of the vessel wall due to smooth muscle cell proliferation, which ultimately leads to luminal narrowing. Patients with evidence of vasculopathy should undergo functional evaluation with dobutamine echocardiography to document ischemic burden. Preventive measures include traditional coronary risk factor modification. Patients are started on statins early in the post-transplantation period and hypertension is treated aggressively using calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Because of their deleterious metabolic effects, steroids may be withdrawn under close surveillance for rejection. After transplant vasculopathy has developed, it is difficult to treat and options are limited. Patients with discrete luminal obstructions may undergo angioplasty, stenting, or coronary artery bypass. However, these procedures are palliative, and the only definitive therapy is retransplantation.", 
    "202": "It is well recognized that the floppy mitral valve (FMV) complex is the central issue in the FMV, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and mitral valvular regurgitation (MVR) story. MVP associated with the FMV results from the systolic movement of portions or segments of the FMV complex into the left atrium (LA). Prolapse of the FMV results in unique forms of mitral valvular dysfunction and MVR. When the FMV is recognized as the basic point of reference, diagnostic and nosologic characterizations are simplified. Each of the consequences of FMV dysfunction--MVP, MVR, and FMV surface phenomena--are dynamic entities and contribute to the symptoms and clinical course in this patient population. Although MVP may occur in the absence of a FMV in individuals with small left ventricular (LV) volume, hyperdynamic, or hypercontractile LV, we do not consider this phenomenon as part of FMV/MVP/MVR. The natural history of the FMV/MVP/MVR is long, and understanding the life history requires long-term follow-up with serial evaluations. Identification of those individuals with FMV/MVP whose symptoms are related to, or associated with, autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ie, the FMV/MVP syndrome) is important, as this distinction has diagnostic and therapeutic implications. In general, patients with FMV/MVP should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis. Data suggest that therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for FMV/MVP and significant MVR may slow the natural regression of the disease. Surgical therapy should be considered in patients with significant MVR and symptoms related to MVR. Explanation for the nature of these symptoms, reassurance, avoidance of volume depletion, catecholamines or other cycle-AMP stimulants and a regular exercise program constitute the basic principles of management for patients with FMV/MVP syndrome.", 
    "203": "Understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure has advanced over the last decade, resulting in new therapeutic advances. Convincing data exist that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and adrenergic blockade are the most important therapies and have the capacity to improve survival and lower morbidity. Higher doses of both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers appear to provide additional benefits. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone, when used in severe heart failure, provides additional survival advantage when added to standard triple therapy. Angiotensin receptor blockers have not been shown to be superior to ACE inhibitors, and their role in heart failure treatment requires further investigation. No trial's data support the use of inotropic agents or calcium channel blockers in heart failure. A number of new therapeutic agents, including vasopressin antagonists and tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor antibody are in phase II and III clinical trials. If proved beneficial, they may provide new treatment options for patients with heart failure. Nevertheless, the current challenge is to increase the use of proven therapies, namely ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, to improve outcomes in the rapidly growing population of patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "204": "To examine whether angiotensin II and endothelins produced in vascular smooth muscle cells can play roles in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity in vascular smooth muscle cells, we measured the activity of MAP kinases in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, and determined effects of renin-angiotensin and endothelin systems activators and inhibitors. Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 produced an activation of MAP kinase activity in vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas the angiotensin receptor antagonist, losartan and the endothelin receptor antagonist, cyclo (D-alpha-aspartyl-L-prolyl-D-valyl-L-leucyl-D-tryptophyl, BQ123) inhibited the enzyme activity. MAP kinase activity in vascular smooth muscle cells was also inhibited either by the renin inhibitor pepstatin A or by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. The degree of the inhibition of MAP kinase activity by pepstatin A, captopril and losartan was almost the same. Renin produced a considerable increase in MAP kinase activity and the renin-induced MAP kinase activation was inhibited by pepstatin A. The endothelin precursor big endothelin-1 produced an increase of MAP kinase activity in vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas the endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitor phosphoramidon inhibited the enzyme activity. These findings suggest that functional renin-angiotensin system and endothelin system are present in vascular smooth muscle cells and these systems tonically serve to increase MAP kinase activity. It appears that renin or renin-like substances play the determining role in the regulation of renin-angiotensin system in vascular smooth muscle cells.",

In POH-F rats and in rats receiving ISO, LV dilatation and a reduced systolic chamber performance were noted. Myocardial hydroxyproline concentrations ([HPRO]) were increased in the POH-F rats, whereas in rats receiving ISO, [HPRO] was decreased. In POH-F rats, the ratio of myocardial collagen type I to type III was increased, but in rats receiving ISO, myocardial collagen I/III was unchanged. In contrast to the diverse changes in myocardial collagen concentrations and phenotypes observed in the 2 models of LV dilatation, the ratio of myocardial insoluble to soluble (relationship between cross-linked and non-cross-linked) collagen was decreased in both the POH-F and ISO groups. Moreover, administration of captopril (0.22 mmol x kg(-1) x d(-1)), which inhibited the ISO-induced reduction in myocardial insoluble/soluble collagen but not the reduction in [HPRO], prevented the ISO-induced alterations in LV dimensions and performance.",

At 16 weeks of age, DS rats exhibited prominent concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function, as estimated by echocardiography. Despite comparable hypotensive effects among all drug treatments, the combination of benazepril 5 mg/kg and valsartan 15 mg/kg improved diastolic dysfunction and survival in DS rats more effectively than ACE inhibitor or ARB alone. Furthermore, the increase in LV endothelin-1 levels and hydroxyproline contents in DS rats was significantly suppressed only by combined benazepril and valsartan, and LV atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA upregulation in DS rats was suppressed to a greater extent by the combination therapy than monotherapy.",

Even in the less favorable hypotheses, ramipril allowed lifetime and yearly cost savings that exceeded 10 to 11 and 20 to 40 times, respectively, the additional costs related to prolonged survival.",

    "215": "The obese Zucker rat exhibits insulin resistance, develops nephropathy at an early age, and may be a model of diabetic nephropathy. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may ameliorate many of the factors that contribute to diabetic nephropathy, while angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are known to be effective. One marker of nephropathy is the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin.", 
    "216": "We studied the effect of DHEA on the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin in obese Zucker rats and compared the changes with those in a control group, a group given quinapril, and a group on a low-calorie diet. DHEA (0.6%) added to plain chow, quinapril (0.3 mg/kg) added to drinking water, and a low-calorie diet based on pair-feeding were administered to obese rats from age 4 to 20 weeks. Immunohistochemical expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, a marker of interstitial and glomerular fibrosis and an early indicator of nephropathy, was measured semiquantitatively in glomeruli, cortical interstitium, and medullary interstitium on a scale of 0 to 4 and was reported as mean +/- SEM.", 
    "217": "When compared with the obese control group, quinapril exhibited a marked reduction in alpha-smooth muscle actin staining in glomeruli, cortical interstitium, and medullary interstitium (P < 0.0005); DHEA reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin staining in cortical interstitium and medullary interstitium (P < 0. 005), and a low-calorie diet reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin staining in cortical and medullary interstitium (P < 0.005), which was similar to the effects of DHEA.", 
    "218": "DHEA was similar to a low-calorie diet in reducing the immunohistochemical staining of alpha-smooth muscle actin in obese Zucker rats. However, quinapril exerted a marked protective effect on the development of fibrosis, as indicated by alpha-smooth muscle actin staining, which was significantly less than that of DHEA at the doses studied.", 
    "219": "Angiotensin II antagonists (AIIA) are part of a new rational treatment of hypertension. Because adverse circulatory effects during anesthesia can occur in patients chronically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, some clinicians discontinue them at least 24 h before operation. No data are available concerning AIIA administration in patients scheduled for vascular surgery performed under general anesthesia. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare hemodynamics during induction of anesthesia in patients chronically treated with AIIA and those of patients not receiving this drug on the morning before operation. Thirty-seven patients chronically treated with AIIA for hypertension were randomly assigned to two groups: Group I: AIIA discontinued on the day before surgery (n = 18); Group II: AIIA given 1 h before anesthesia (n = 19). Patients received sufentanil 0.4 microg/kg, propofol 1.5 mg/kg, and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. During the procedure, the anesthesiologist was required to maintain systolic blood pressure and heart rate within 30% of baseline values using intravascular fluid administration and vasoconstric- tors (e.g. , ephedrine, phenylephrine, or terlipressin). Hemodynamic variables were recorded each 1 min. Hemodynamic study ended at incision. The number and duration of hemodynamic events were collected, and total doses of vasoactive drugs were noted in each group. Systolic arterial pressure was significantly decreased in Group II at 5, 15 and 23 min after induction of anesthesia (*P < 0.05). In this group, the decrease in systolic arterial pressure was associated with more frequent episodes of hypotension (AIIA withdrawn: 1 +/- 1; AIIA given: 2 +/- 1; P < 0.01), with a larger number of patients developing at least 1 episode of hypotension (AIIA withdrawn: 12; AIIA given: 19; P < 0.01), and a longer duration of an episode of hypotension (AIIA withdrawn: 3 +/- 4 min; AIIA given: 8 +/- 7 min; P < 0.01), and an increased need for vasoactive drugs. In conclusion, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system increases the potential hypotensive effect of anesthetic induction. A severe hypotensive episode, requiring vasoconstrictor treatment, occurs after induction of general anesthesia in patients chronically treated with AIIA. Recommendations to discontinue AIIA drugs on the day before the surgery may be justified.",

Recent large scale clinical trials have begun to furnish evidence of the effects of blocking the renin-angiotensin system in patients with heart failure using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or, more recently, angiotensin II receptor blockers that act directly at the receptor level, independent of pathways for angiotensin II generation. Results so far indicate that there are benefits from optimizing the blockade, but open questions remain, such as the role of endothelin and bradykinins, and the extent of crosstalk between the different systems.",

    "239": "A 53-year-old male was found to have hypertension caused by the significant secretion of renin from an atrophic left kidney. He had undergone extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for left renal lithiasis 11 years previously. A renal dynamic study with 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) indicated that the rate of renal excretion and uptake was decreased in the left kidney and normal in the right kidney. Renal angiography demonstrated a normal right renal artery and a small but nonstenotic left renal artery. The ratio of PRA in the left renal vein to that in the right renal vein was 1.7. Blood pressure could be lowered to the range of 140-150/80-90 mmHg with imidapril, an ACE inhibitor. ESWL may cause hypertension via the well-known Page kidney effect. In this case, the kidney, atrophic probably due to ESWL, released a significant amount of renin.", 
    "240": "This experiment was designed to determine how the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, acts on left ventricular wall stress and cardiac polyamine concentrations in Tsukuba hypertensive mice (THMs) carrying both human renin and angiotensinogen genes. Twelve-week-old THMs were treated with either lisinopril or hydralazine, or were left untreated, for 8 weeks. C57BL/6 mice of similar age were used as normal controls. Each group consisted of 14 mice. The systolic blood pressure of each mouse was measured once a week. Mice were euthanized at 20 weeks of age, and the left ventricular weight, left ventricular diameter, left ventricular wall stress, and left ventricular polyamine concentrations were measured. The systolic blood pressure of the untreated group was approximately 35 mmHg higher than that of the C57BL/6 mice. The left ventricular weight, left ventricular diameter, left ventricular wall stress, and left ventricular polyamine concentrations in the untreated group were significantly higher compared to those in the C57BL/6 mice. The lisinopril group had significantly decreased systolic blood pressure and other measurement items, except the left ventricular wall stress, in comparison with the untreated group. The hydralazine group also had significantly decreased systolic blood pressure and left ventricular wall stress when compared with the untreated group, but no significant differences in other measurement items when compared with the untreated group. These findings indicate that lisinopril reduces left ventricular hypertrophy and polyamine concentration without reducing left ventricular wall stress, and that simply decreasing blood pressure does not suppress left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "241": "The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, and a calcium antagonist, nitrendipine, on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and renal function in mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria. After the 4-week drug-free period, 17 patients were randomly divided into two groups. The first group (group 1: n=8) received lisinopril 10-20 mg daily for 8 weeks followed by nitrendipine 5-10 mg daily for another 8 weeks. The second group (group 2: n=9) received nitrendipine 5-10 mg daily for 8 weeks followed by lisinopril 10-20 mg daily for another 8 weeks. The mean blood pressure (MBP) significantly decreased in a similar manner in both groups. UAE significantly decreased after 8 weeks of treatment with lisinopril in group 1 and after 8 weeks of subsequent treatment with lisinopril in group 2. On the other hand, UAE was not altered by treatment with nitrendipine. The changes in UAE were significantly correlated with changes in MBP after 8 weeks of treatment with nitrendipine, but not after 8 weeks of treatment with lisinopril. No significant changes in creatinine clearance, urinary excretion of sodium or urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide were observed by any treatment in either group. These results suggest that lisinopril, not nitrendipine, reduces UAE in essential hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria independently of its effective antihypertensive properties.", 
    "242": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are thought to be at high risk for cardiovascular diseases. Recent guidelines for treatment of hypertension such as the JNC VI and WHO/ISH guidelines, recommend that antihypertensive agents be strated at as low as at 130/85 mmHg and that blood pressure be lowered to less than 130/85 mmHg. Our study was designed to clarify how well and to what extent blood pressure (BP) was controlled in Japanese hypertensive patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. We interviewed two hundred physicians, randomly sellected from among the members of the Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) (n=98) and the Japanese Diabetes Society (JDS) (n=102) and obtained information regarding five most recent cases of hypertension with (n=954 in total) and their 2 most recent cases of hypertension without diabetes (n=371 in total). The achieved BP was below 140/90 mmHg in 40.5% of non-diabetic and 38.3% of diabetic hypertensives. The percentage of patients whose BP was less than 130/85 mmHg was 10.8% in nondiabetics and 11.4% in diabetics. The average number of hypotensive agents used was 1.46 in nondiabetics and 1.52 in diabetics. Physicians prescribed more ACE inhibitors and alpha-blockers in diabetics than in nondiabetics, although Ca-antagonists were administered in more than 70% of patients irrespective of whether or not they had diabetes. In contrast, fewer beta-blockers and diuretics were administered to diabetics. These results suggest that although Japanese physicians are considering the effects of hypotensive agents on metabolism and renal function when they treat diabetic hypertensives, the achieved blood pressure in both hypertensives with and those without diabetes is insufficient, with only one of ten patients having a blood pressure less than 130/85 mmHg even among diabetics. Improved blood pressure control will therefore be needed to treat high risk groups such as patients with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "243": "Many investigators have reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have antiproteinuric effects and retard the progression of renal impairment in diabetic patients. On the other hand, those effects of ACE inhibitors have not been well established in patients with essential hypertension. This study was conducted to prospectively evaluate whether an ACE inhibitor, temocapril, could modify the urinary microalbumin excretion rate (UAE) in hypertensive outpatients who had no signs of renal impairment. To compare the long-term effect of temocapril with that of a diuretic on UAE, hypertensive patients treated with a diuretic (trichlormethiazide) were enrolled in a prospective study if they had normal serum creatinine levels and no overt proteinuria during a 3-month screening period. A urinary microalbumin-to-urinary-creatinine ratio (mg albumin/mmol Cr) was used as an estimate of UAE. Patients visited the hospital monthly to determine blood pressure (BP) and UAE. After baseline observation during the treatment with the diuretic, the subjects were randomly divided into two groups. In group A, the diuretic was switched to temocapril, 2 to 4 mg once daily for 12 months. In group B, the subjects continued to receive the diuretic for an additional 12 months. Seventy-six outpatients (41 men and 35 women; mean age, 59.0+/-1.4 years) with essential hypertension entered the study. The effects of temocapril on BP appeared to be clinically similar to those of the trichlormethiazide, but the use of temocapril significantly decreased UAE. In group A (n=37), UAE decreased significantly (p<0.01) from the baseline value of 4.19+/-0.37 mg albumin/mmol Cr to 2.47+/-0.29 and 2.68+/-0.28 mg albumin/mmol Cr at the 6th and 12th month of temocapril therapy, respectively. In contrast, in group B (n=39) UAE was unchanged (baseline, 4.16+/-0.63 mg albumin/mmol Cr; 6 months, 4.92+/-0.72; 12 months, 4.71+/-0.74). These results indicate that long-term therapy with temocapril may be superior in reducing UAE than is diuretic therapy in patients with essential hypertension who had no signs of renal impairment.", 
    "244": "To evaluate the effect of antihypertensive therapy on platelet activation in essential hypertension, the plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) were examined in 45 patients with essential hypertension and 20 age-matched normotensive control subjects. Hypertensive patients were assigned to monotherapy with one of five different antihypertensive drugs for 6 months, and the change of plasma levels of beta-TG was reexamined after the completion of the monotherapy. The plasma beta-TG increased in hypertensive patients compared with levels in normotensive control subjects. Monotherapy with each drug resulted in sufficient blood pressure control in all hypertensive patients. The plasma beta-TG decreased significantly after monotherapy with an alpha-blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). The plasma beta-TG increased with the use of a diuretic but did not change with the use of a beta-blocker or calcium antagonist. The platelet activation observed in patients with essential hypertension is reversed by monotherapy with an alpha-blocker or an ACEI. It is possible that these drugs reduce the development of hypertensive vascular complications due to suppression of platelet activation in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "245": "We compared the effects of dihydropyridine type Ca channel blocker slow-release nicardipine and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients (n=20). Nicardipine or enalapril was administered for 6 months by a crossover design. Nicardipine and enalapril comparably lowered blood pressure. Enalapril significantly reduced urinary albumin excretion in microalbuminuric patients, whereas nicardipine did not. Urinary beta2-microglobulin excretion was significantly increased during nicardipine treatment. However, both drugs significantly reduced plasma ET-1 as compared with pretreatment levels, close to that in healthy control (2.9 +/- 0.3 pg/ml in control, 4.8 +/- 0.3 pg/ml before treatment, 3.2 +/- 0.3 pg/ml during nicardipine vs before treatment p<0.05, 2.9 +/- 0.4 pg/ml during enalapril vs before treatment p<0.01). The decrease in plasma ET-1 was significantly correlated with the increase in natriuresis in normoalbuminuric patients treated with enalapril ( r= -0.82, p<0.01) but not in those treated with nicardipine. Although nicardipine and enalapril had different renal effects, both drugs equally suppressed plasma ET-1 levels in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "246": "Although results of randomized trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of ACE-inhibitors, mortality and morbidity remain high in patients with heart failure and myocardial infarction. In fact, there are data suggesting that aldosterone production may occur despite ACE-inhibitor treatment. There is recent evidence that aldosterone exerts a pro-fibrotic effect, via the mineralocorticoid receptors in cardiovascular tissues resulting in partial aldosterone production during ACE-inhibitor treatment. Mineralocorticoids have also been identified within the cardiovascular system and they may determine increased collagen synthesis which within fibroblasts is largely controlled by locally generated aldosterone. Cardiovascular tissue also expresses genes which are responsible for the late stages of aldosterone and corticosterone formation. Cardiac and vascular tissues elaborate the aforementioned steroids, with the result that aldosterone is more concentrated in the cardiovascular tissue rather than in the circulation. It is probable that locally, while not contributing to the coronary circulation, aldosterone plays an autocrine and/or paracrine role within the tissue of origin. Such roles may relate to local modulation of vessel tonicity and structure, with consequent effects on blood pressure, and repair of damaged tissue through a possible up-regulation of collagen deposition. The ability of the cardiovascular system to elaborate aldosterone opens a vast new area of study since it is becoming increasingly apparent that this local production of mineralocorticoids results in high levels of steroids within the cells of origin and those in the immediate vicinity. The recent RALES trial has shown a significant reduction in mortality, non-fatal hospitalization and sudden death. The fact that patients were on ACE-inhibitors, and accordingly circulating aldosterone levels were presumably reduced, presents the intriguing possibility that spironolactone may block the autocrine and paracrine effects of locally generated aldosterone. This trial has contributed to better understand the pathophysiology of heart failure and its therapeutic strategies. Further studies are required to address this treatment in patients with other heart diseases (hypertension, post-myocardial infarction) and in lower heart failure classes.", 
    "247": "Previous studies have demonstrated in normal rats that chronic treatment, from weaning to 30 days, with either enalapril or losartan, induced significant changes in cardiovascular structure and function. The present study was performed to assess the effect of either enalapril or losartan on the structure and function of the heart and arteries given to normal rats from weaning until 6 months of age. Animals (n = 48) were divided into three groups: control, enalapril treated, and losartan treated; treated rats received 10 mg/kg/day of drug. Blood pressure, body weight, and water intake were recorded for that time period. DNA, cGMP, collagen, degree of fibrosis, and nitric oxide synthase-NADPH-diaphorase-dependent activity in the heart and arteries were determined. Only significant differences (P < .05) are reported. Blood pressure increased only in control rats (13 +/- 1 mm Hg), enalapril treatment enhanced water intake and reduced the rate of body growth (control, 672.9 +/- 15.4 g; losartan, 692.4 +/- 21.8 g; enalapril, 541.8 +/- 13.8 g). In the heart, DNA (control, 120 +/- 5; losartan, 99 +/- 4; enalapril, 93 +/- 6 microg/100 mg), collagen (control, 2.5 +/- 0.2; enalapril, 1.85 +/- 0.08 microg/100 mg), and fibrosis (control, 3.5 +/- 0.4%; losartan, 2.2 +/- 0.3%; enalapril, 2.1 +/- 0.4%) were reduced by treatment. In the aorta, cGMP (control, 0.15 +/- 0.01; losartan, 0.24 +/- 0.02 pmol/mg), and NADPH-diaphorase (control, 0.114 +/- 0.003; losartan, 0.148 +/- 0.006; enalapril, 0.169 +/- 0.003 as optical density) were enhanced. The enzyme was also higher in the aortic endothelium of treated animals (control, 0.193 +/- 0.010; losartan, 0.228 +/- 0.009; enalapril, 0.278 +/- 0.005). The lower rate of body weight increase, the enhanced water intake, and the reduced cardiac and left ventricular weight attributable to enalapril treatment do not seem to be related to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. On the other hand, renin-angiotensin system inhibition induces a protective effect on the heart and aorta through structural and functional changes. Most of this action seems to be exerted through angiotensin II type 1 receptors.", 
    "248": "AT1 receptor antagonists control blood pressure (BP) effectively and reduce left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension. Because left ventricular hypertrophy is very common in renal transplant recipients, we examined the cardiovascular effects and the safety profile of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan in hypertensive renal transplant recipients. In 20 renal transplant recipients with stable renal graft function 50 mg of losartan was added to the preexisting antihypertensive treatment (no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) at least 6 months after renal transplantation. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP, two-dimensional-guided M-mode echocardiography, and duplex sonography, as well as renal function, red blood cell count, cyclosporine A and FK 506 levels, erythropoetin, and angiotensin II concentration were determined at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. With 24-h ambulatory BP measurement, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was reduced by 7.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 4.5 +/- 1.8 mm Hg (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Posterior, septal, and relative wall thickness decreased by 0.95 +/- 0.2 mm, 0.91 +/- 0.2 mm and 0.04 +/- 0.01 mm, respectively (all P < .001). Left ventricular mass index decreased by 18.1 +/- 4.7 g/m2 (P < .01). Ejection fraction and midwall fractional fiber shortening as systolic parameters and the relation of passive-to-active diastolic filling of the left ventricle were unaltered. Serum creatinine and cyclosporine A concentration remained stable in all patients. Hemoglobin and hematocrit decreased by 1.0 +/- 0.3 g/dL and 3.6% +/- 0.9%, respectively (P < .002 and P < .001) without a change in serum erythropoetin level. In renal transplant recipients the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan reduces left ventricular hypertrophy without altering systolic or diastolic function. It is safe with regard to renal function and immunosuppression, but slightly decreases hemoglobin level.", 
    "249": "This study investigated whether a drug therapy-induced reduction in nocturnal blood pressure (BP) was associated with decreased sleep apnea activity. Two polysomnographies from 54 hospitalized male hypertensive, obstructive sleep apnea patients were analyzed in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril (C), 2.5 mg once daily, or placebo (P). Blood pressure was measured by means of an intra-arterial catheter. Compared with P, C lowered mean arterial BP during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (-8.3 +/- 10.7 mm Hg, P = .05) and REM sleep (-8.6 +/- 10.1 mm Hg, P = .02). Respiratory disturbance index (-8.6 +/- 3.2 events/h of sleep (n/h), P = .01) and apnea index (AI) (-6.6 +/- 3.0 n/h, P = .04) during NREM sleep were lowered by C and, to a lesser extent, by P (-5.9 +/- 3.2 n/h, P = .07 and -5.0 +/- 3.6 n/h, P = .18, respectively). The effect on AI and hypopnea index (HI) during REM sleep was not significant for C (-5.9 +/- 3.4 and 0.1 +/- 2.0, NS, respectively) and P (-2.6 +/- 3.9 and 1.6 +/- 2.0, NS, respectively). There was a significant linear correlation between the change in REM systolic BP and the change in REM AI (r = 0.28, P = .04); the mean BP change correlated negatively with the change in HI (-0.28, P = .04). During NREM sleep there was no significant correlation between changes in BP and the treatment effects on sleep apnea activity. Blood pressure reduction after short-term antihypertensive treatment did not affect sleep disordered breathing during NREM sleep. Reduced BP was associated with a weak reduction of AI and a slight increase of HI during REM sleep. It appears that elevated BP contributes only marginally to sleep apnea severity in hypertensive patients with obstructive sleep apnea.",

Cardiac involvement, which typically appears decades after the initial infection, may result in cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular aneurysm, congestive heart failure, thromboembolism, and sudden cardiac death. Between 16 and 18 million persons are infected in Latin America. The migration of infected Latin Americans to the United States or other countries where the disease is uncommon poses two problems: the misdiagnosis or undiagnosis of Chagas' heart disease in these immigrants and the possibility of transmission of Chagas' disease through blood transfusions. Diagnosis is based on positive serologic tests and the clinical features. The antiparasitic drug, benznidazole, is effective when given for the initial infection and may also be beneficial for the chronic phase. The use of amiodarone, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and pacemaker implantation may contribute to a better survival in selected patients with cardiac involvement of chronic Chagas' disease.",

Amino acid and carbohydrate contents were analyzed. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of N. virens DCP was (NH2)D-E-E-A-G-R-Q-W-L-A-E-Y-D-L-R-N-Q-T-V-L-. Peptide maps of N. virens DCP from lysyl endopeptidase digestion were different from rabbit p-ACE. The far-ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra of N. virens DCP indicated that the secondary structure of this enzyme seemed to be an alpha-helical structure and was similar to that of rabbit p-ACE, but the near-ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra of N. virens DCP indicated that the aromatic amino acid residue circumambience of this enzyme was different from rabbit p-ACE. The effects of several reagents for chemical modification of amino acids on the activity of N. virens DCP were tested. Arg, Tyr, Glu, and/or Asp, His, Trp, and Met caused loss of the activity. In addition, the IC50 and Ki values for a well-known ACE inhibitor, Val-Tyr, which was a competitive inhibitor of N. virens DCP, were 263 and 20 microM, respectively. These results suggested that N. virens DCP is different from mammalian ACE in the molecular and inhibitory properties, although the same substrate specificity was demonstrated in a previous paper.",

    "275": "The electron-conformational (EC) method of pharmacophore (Pha) identification and bioactivity prediction, suggested earlier, is given here two major improvements. First, an atomic index of orbital and charge controlled interaction is introduced to better represent the ligand (substrate) in its interaction with the bioreceptor. Second, the multiconformational problem is considered in view of ligand-receptor binding states, resulting in essential simplification of the expression of bioactivity. The details of the improved EC method are demonstrated in application to the problem of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The Pha of the latter is identified by separation of the heavily populated conformations of the chosen 51 compounds (the training set), calculation of the electronic structure, construction of their EC matrixes of congruity, and processing of the latter in comparison with the activities to reveal a common submatrix of all the active only compounds that describes the Pha. The latter contains three oxygen atoms plus a fourth atom X = S, N, O at certain interatomic distances and with restricted electronic parameters (within assumed tolerances), the position of the atom X being more changeable from one active compound to another. For quantitative prediction of the bioactivity, an expression is deduced which takes into account the duly parametrized influence of auxiliary groups (AG) which, being positioned outside the Pha, either diminish the activity (antipharmacophore shielding) or enhance it. It is shown that in case of many conformations of the same compound only one of them, that of the lowest energy which has the Pha, should be parametrized. The 15 parameters chosen to represent the AG in case of ACE inhibitors are weighted by variational (adjustable) coefficients which are determined from a regression treatment of the calculated versus known activities in the training set. Then the formulas with known coefficients are used to validate the method by calculating the bioactivity of other compounds not used in the training set. The prediction of the activity proved to be more than 90% (within experimental error and available compounds) qualitatively (yes, no) and about 60%-70% quantitatively.", 
    "276": "This review discusses the use of antihypertensive drugs in acute and long term treatment of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including their placental transfer and adverse effects on the fetus. All antihypertensive agents cross the placental barrier and are present in varying concentrations in the fetal circulation, with varying resultant effects on fetal metabolism. Antihypertensive drugs that are lipid soluble will pass through the placental barrier with ease whereas the most polar will not. Placental transfer diminishes under conditions that decrease the surface area or increase the thickness of the placenta. Highly protein-bound drugs form complexes which impair placental transfer while unbound drugs cross the placenta easily. The ionised drug form is highly charged and cannot cross lipid membranes while the un-ionised form can easily cross the placenta. A decrease in placental blood flow can slow down the transfer of lipid soluble drugs to the fetus. Close monitoring of the fetal and maternal condition is necessary for the rest of the pregnancy after antihypertensive therapy is commenced. Methyldopa is the initial drug of choice for long term oral antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy. Neither short term nor long term use of methyldopa is associated with adverse effects. In the short term (<6 weeks) beta-receptor antagonists are effective and well tolerated provided there are no signs of intrauterine growth impairment. ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors are contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy because they are teratogenic. Intravenous dihydralazine is widely used for rapid reductions of severely elevated blood pressure. The use of nifedipine concurrently with MgSO4 must be approached with caution because the combination is associated with severe hypotension, neuromuscular blockade and cardiac depression. In the last decade, knowledge of antihypertensive drugs used in pregnancy has improved and new drugs, e.g. calcium antagonists, which have been shown to have great potential for use in pregnancy, have been introduced. Safety for the fetus with newer drugs has not yet been adequately evaluated. Currently, well established and cost effective drugs such as methyldopa (long term use) and intravenous dihydralazine (rapid reduction) are the agents of choice to treat hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.",

A high dose of TEM significantly lowered BP and suppressed both intense proteinuria and glomerular extracapillary lesions including macrophage infiltration. On the other hand, although a low dose of TEM did not significantly lower BP throughout the experimental period, it prevented renal lesions almost in the same manner as high-dose TEM with suppression of c-myc gene expression in glomeruli.

This study describes the plasma profile along with isolation and identification of urinary metabolites of omapatrilat from subjects dosed orally with 50 mg of [(14)C]omapatrilat. Only a portion of the radioactivity in plasma was unextractable (40-43%). Prominent metabolites identified in plasma were S-methyl omapatrilat, acyl glucuronide of S-methyl omapatrilat, and S-methyl (S)-2-thio-3-phenylpropionic acid. Omapatrilat accounted for less than 3% of the radioactivity. However, after dithiothreitol reduction all of the radioactivity was extractable and was characterized to be omapatrilat and its hydrolysis product (S)-2-thio-3-phenylpropionic acid, both apparently bound to proteins via reversible disulfide bonds. Urinary profile of radioactivity showed no parent compound but the presence of several metabolites that can be grouped into three categories. 1) Three metabolites, accounting for 56% of the urinary radioactivity, resulted from the hydrolysis of the exocyclic amide bond of omapatrilat. Two metabolites were diastereomers of S-methyl sulfoxide of (S)-2-thio-3-phenylpropionic acid, and the third was the acyl glucuronide of S-methyl (S)-2-thio-3-phenylpropionic acid. 2) One disulfide, identified as the L-cysteine mixed disulfide of omapatrilat, accounted for 8% of the radioactivity in the urine. 3) Five metabolites, derived from omapatrilat, accounted for 30% of the radioactivity in the urine. Two of these metabolites were mixtures of diastereomers of S-methyl sulfoxide of omapatrilat and the third was the S-methyl omapatrilat ring sulfoxide. The other two metabolites were S-methyl omapatrilat and its acyl glucuronide. These results indicate that omapatrilat undergoes extensive metabolism in humans.", 
    "302": "The effect of dexamethasone on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in primary culture of adult cardiac fibroblasts was analyzed in this study. ACE is central to cardiac remodeling in conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). Some studies indicate that glucocorticoids are often increased post-MI, whereas other studies suggest that glucocorticoids stimulate ACE activity in various cell types. Most cardiac cells are fibroblasts, which have an important function in cardiac remodeling. Therefore, we studied the effects of glucocorticoids on ACE activity and mRNA levels in primary cultures of adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. Steady-state ACE activity was very low, but it increased sixfold with dexamethasone (1 microM for 48 h) treatment. ACE activation occurred within 12 h and peaked at 96 h, after treatment. RNase-protection assays revealed an associated threefold increase (P < 0.05) in ACE mRNA. Dexamethasone's stimulatory effect was abolished by an RNA synthesis inhibitor (actinomycin D, 5 microg/ml) but was potentiated by a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide, 5 microg/ml). The glucocorticoid-mediated response appears to be specific, because mineralocorticoid treatment did not alter ACE activity. These findings indicate that both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved in glucocorticoid regulation of ACE expression in rat cardiac fibroblasts.", 
    "303": "Viral infection of the heart is relatively common and usually of little consequence. It can, however, lead to substantial cardiac damage and severe acute heart failure. It can also evolve into the progressive syndrome of chronic heart failure. Recent studies have gone some way towards unravelling the complex mechanisms underlying the heart muscle damage that occurs after viral infection. These studies have lent support to both immune and viral mediated (independent of an immune response) cardiac damage. Acute myocarditis can present in various ways, and it may be a cause of sudden death in an otherwise healthy young adult. New treatments for viral heart disease are awaited. In the meanwhile, the haemodynamic support of patients with acute left ventricular failure caused by myocarditis should be aggressive, to allow for the possibility of spontaneous recovery. Contemporary trials of treatment in chronic heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy support the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta adrenoceptor blockers, and spironolactone in such patients.", 
    "304": "In healthy individuals, endothelial cells regulate a host of functions including vasomotor tone, thrombosis/ fibrinolysis, and cell-cell interactions. The development of endothelial dysfunction may be a common pathway by which cardiovascular risk factors impact plaque formation, growth, and rupture. Many pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions known to decrease cardiovascular risk also improve endothelial function. For these reasons, some have suggested that improvement in endothelial function may be an important therapeutic target in the treatment of coronary artery disease.",

Myocardial O(2) consumption was measured using a Clark-type O(2) electrode in an air-tight stirred bath. Concentration-response curves to ramiprilat (RAM), amlodipine (AMLO), diltiazem (DIL), carbachol (CCL), substance P (SP) and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) were performed. The rate of decrease in O(2) concentration was expressed as a percentage of the baseline.", 
    "307": "Baseline O(2) consumption was not different between the three groups of mice. In tissues from wild type mice, RAM (10(-5) mol/l), AMLO (10(-5) mol/l), DIL (10(-4) mol/l), CCL (10(-4) mol/l), SP (10(-7) mol/l) and SNAP (10(-4) mol/l) reduced myocardial O(2) consumption by -32+/-4, -27+/-10, -20+/-6, -25+/-2, -22+/-4 and -42+/-4%, respectively. The responses to RAM, AMLO, CCL and SP were absent in tissues taken from eNOS -/- mice (-7.1+/-4.3, -5.0+/-6.0, -5.2+/-5.1 and -0.4+/-0.2%, respectively). In addition, L-NAME significantly (P<0.05) inhibited the reduction in O(2) consumption induced by RAM (-9.8+/-4.4%), AMLO (-1.0+/-6.0%), CCL (-8.8+/-3.7%) and SP (-6.6+/-4.9%) in cardiac tissues from wild type mice. In contrast, NO-independent responses to the calcium channel antagonist, DIL, and responses to the NO donor, SNAP, were not affected in cardiac tissues taken from eNOS -/- (DIL: -20+/-4%; SNAP: -46+/-6%) or L-NAME-treated (DIL: -17+/-2%; SNAP: -33+/-5%) mice.",

    "309": "ANG II mediates the hypertrophic response of overloaded cardiac muscle, likely via the ANG II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor. To examine the potential role of ANG II in overload-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy, plantaris and/or soleus muscle overload was produced in female Sprague-Dawley rats (225-250 g) by the bilateral surgical ablation of either the synergistic gastrocnemius muscle (experiment 1) or both the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles (experiment 2). In experiment 1 (n = 10/group), inhibiting endogenous ANG II production by oral administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor during a 28-day overloading protocol attenuated plantaris and soleus muscle hypertrophy by 57 and 96%, respectively (as measured by total muscle protein content). ACE inhibition had no effect on nonoverloaded (sham-operated) muscles. With the use of new animals (experiment 2; n = 8/group), locally perfusing overloaded soleus muscles with exogenous ANG II (via osmotic pump) rescued the lost hypertrophic response in ACE-inhibited animals by 71%. Furthermore, orally administering an AT(1) receptor antagonist instead of an ACE inhibitor produced a 48% attenuation of overload-induced hypertrophy that could not be rescued by ANG II perfusion. Thus ANG II may be necessary for optimal overload-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy, acting at least in part via an AT(1) receptor-dependent pathway.", 
    "310": "In type 1 diabetes, increases in sodium-lithium countertransport (Na-Li CT), kidney volume (KV), and albumin excretion rate (AER) may precede the development of persistent microalbuminuria. Limited data exist on reversibility of these factors early in the evolution of diabetic nephropathy. A crossover design was used to study the separate effects of enalapril and intensive diabetes management (IDM) on Na-Li CT, KV and AER in 17 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (5-10 years duration) with large kidneys (>275 ml/1. 73 m(2)) and predominantly normoalbuminuria. Subjects were randomized to receive 3 months of either enalapril (0.25 mg/kg/day) or IDM, a 3-month washout, followed by the alternate treatment for 3 months. During IDM, HbA1c decreased 2.5% (pre 9.5+/-0.3% (mean+/-SE), post 7.0+/-0.1%, p<0.0001), but was unchanged while on enalapril (pre 8.8+/-0.3%, post 8.5+/-0.3%, p=0.1). A significant decrease in Na-Li CT was seen with IDM (pre 0.43+/-0.05, post 0.36+/-0.04 mmol/l RBC/h, p=0.006) but not angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-i) (pre 0.39+/-0.04, post 0.38+/-0.04 mmol/RBC/h, p=0.4). Neither ACE-i nor IDM affected KV or AER. It is concerning that kidney enlargement does not appear reversible at this early stage in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, although our conclusions are limited by the short duration of intervention and small sample size. The reduction in Na-Li CT with IDM suggests this may be a potentially modifiable risk factor for diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "311": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive patients are at risk for the development of a variety of acute and chronic renal diseases. The most common cause of chronic renal failure in HIV-1-seropositive patients is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN occurs almost exclusively in black patients and the majority of published cases are of patients who present with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This disease is currently the third leading cause of end-stage renal disease in blacks aged 20-64. Because HIV-1-seropositive patients may develop a wide variety of acute and chronic renal diseases, definitive diagnosis requires renal biopsy. Emerging data suggest a direct role of HIV-1 infection of kidney cells in the pathogenesis of HIVAN. There have been no well-controlled clinical trials in the treatment of HIVAN. The therapeutic agents with the most promise are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and antiretroviral medications. Long-term renal prognosis may be changing in the setting of improved aggressive antiretroviral therapy. Patient survival is determined primarily by the stage of HIV-1 infection. In this article, we present the case history of a patient who developed HIVAN. We then review the current literature concerning the epidemiology, differential diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of HIVAN.", 
    "312": "While the biology of the pathogenesis of scleroderma is continually being better understood, there still is no single agent or therapeutic combination that has a clear impact on the disease process. Traditional medications (colchicine, potassium aminobenzoate (potaba), D-penicillamine) are disappointing in clinical practice despite anecdotal evidence of benefit. Furthermore, the most popular traditional drug, D-penicillamine, failed to clearly show benefit when tested in a well-designed clinical trial comparing conventional high dose with a very low dose (125 mg po. every other day [corrected]) [1]. Currently, most success in managing scleroderma and improving quality of life is secondary to organ-specific therapy, such as management of a renal crisis with an ACE inhibitor, treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon with calcium channel blockers, or control of serious gastrointestinal reflux disease with a proton pump inhibitor. In this review we will focus on novel therapies that are currently being tested in the treatment of scleroderma and have the potential of modifying the disease process and overall clinical outcome. We have attempted to review the rationale for each agent, recognising that its true biological effect will only be determined in clinical trials.", 
    "313": "It is unclear whether the previous in vitro evidence of a link between angiotensin II (Ang II) and growth factor receptors can apply to the in vivo situation. In this study, we examined vascular platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activation in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and the role of Ang II. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of the growth factor receptors was determined by Western blot analysis coupled with immunoprecipitation. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of the aortic PDGF beta-receptor, but not the EGF receptor, was chronically increased in SHRSP with hypertension, compared with normotensive rats, being accompanied by increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Treatment of SHRSP with ACE inhibitors (perindopril or enalapril) significantly reduced aortic PDGF beta-receptor tyrosyl phosphorylation and ERK activity, whereas treatment with hydralazine failed to reduce these activities. Therefore, these aortic changes in SHRSP were mediated by Ang II in response to vascular ACE. Ang II was infused into rats to examine the effects on aortic growth factor receptors. Chronic Ang II infusion, via the angiotensin type 1 receptor, significantly increased activation of the aortic PDGF beta-receptor but not the EGF receptor. Thus, the aortic PDGF beta-receptor, activated by ACE-mediated Ang II, seems to be responsible for vascular remodeling in hypertensive rats.", 
    "314": "We have demonstrated previously that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with enalapril and angiotensin II blockade with losartan improve acetylcholine-dependent endothelial function in resistance vessels of patients with Type II diabetes. It was therefore of interest to examine the effect of losartan on conduit vessel function in this group. The influence of losartan (50 mg daily for 4 weeks) on endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilator function was determined in 12 subjects with Type II diabetes using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover protocol. Conduit vessel endothelial function was assessed using high-resolution ultrasound and the brachial artery response to reactive hyperaemia (flow-mediated dilation; FMD); glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was used as a non-endothelium-dependent dilator. Losartan administration significantly increased the FMD response from 5.2+/-0.7% (mean+/-S.E.M.) to 7.4+/-0.6% of vessel diameter (P<0.05; paired t-test). There was no effect of losartan on the endothelium-independent responses to GTN (17.8+/-1.8% to 17.6+/-1.2%). Consistent with our previous findings in resistance vessels, administration of 50 mg of losartan daily improves NO-mediated dilation in the conduit vessels of subjects with Type II diabetes. Together with the findings that both ACE inhibition and angiotensin II blockade improve resistance vessel function in this group, it is likely that at least some of the beneficial effect is mediated through the angiotensin II/type I receptor pathway. A type I receptor antagonist seems a reasonable alternative to an ACE inhibitor to maintain conduit vessel endothelial function in Type II diabetic subjects.", 
    "315": "It has been postulated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor antagonist (ACEI/ATRA) may decrease proteinuria in patients with glomerulonephritis by its action on the glomerular basement membrane. We therefore studied the relationship between the response of patients with IgA nephritis (IgAN) to ACEI/ATRA therapy by decreasing proteinuria and its effect on the selectivity index (SI) in these patients.", 
    "316": "Forty-one patients with biopsy-proven IgAN entered a control trial, with 21 in the treatment group and 20 in the control group. The entry criteria included proteinuria of 1 g or more and/or renal impairment. Patients in the treatment group received ACEI/ATRA or both with three monthly increases in dosage. In the control group, hypertension was treated with atenolol, hydrallazine, or methyldopa. The following tests were performed at three monthly intervals: serum creatinine, total urinary protein, SI, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and low molecular weight (LMW) proteinuria.", 
    "317": "After a mean duration of therapy of 13 +/- 5 months, in the treatment group, there was no significant change in serum creatinine, proteinuria, or SI, but in the control group, serum creatinine deteriorated from 1.8 +/- 0.8 to 2.3 +/- 1.1 mg/dL (P < 0.05). Among the 21 patients in the treatment group, 10 responded to ACEI/ATRA therapy determined as a decrease in proteinuria by 30% (responders), and the other 11 did not respond (nonresponders). Among the responders, SI improved from a mean of 0.26 +/- 0.07 to 0.18 +/- 0. 07 (P < 0.001), indicating a tendency toward selective proteinuria. This was associated with an improvement in serum creatinine from mean 1.7 +/- 0.6 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 mg/dL (P < 0.02) and a decrease in proteinuria from a mean of 2.3 +/- 1.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.5 g/day (P < 0. 001). After treatment, proteinuria in the treatment group (1.8 +/- 1. 6 g/day) was significantly less than in the control group (2.9 +/- 1. 8 g/day, P < 0.05). The post-treatment SI in the responder group (0. 18 +/- 0.07) was better than that of the nonresponder group (0.33 +/- 0.11, P < 0.002). Eight out of 21 patients in the treatment group who had documented renal impairment had improved renal function compared with two in the control group (chi2 = 4.4, P < 0. 05). Of the eight patients in the treatment group who improved their renal function, three normalized their renal function compared with one from the control group.", 
    "318": "Our data suggest that ACEI/ATRA therapy may be beneficial in patients with IgAN with renal impairment and nonselective proteinuria, as such patients may respond to therapy with improvement in protein selectivity, decrease in proteinuria, and improvement in renal function. ACEI/ATRA therapy probably modifies pore size distribution by reducing the radius of large unselective pores, causing the shunt pathway to become less pronounced, resulting in less leakage of protein into the urine.", 
    "319": "Recent progress has been remarkable in identifying mutations which cause diseases (mostly uncommon) that are inherited simply. Unfortunately, the common diseases of humankind with a strong genetic component, such as those affecting cardiovascular function, have proved less tractable. Their etiology is complex with substantial environmental components and strong indications that multiple genes are implicated. In this article, we consider the genetic etiology of essential hypertension. After presenting the distribution of blood pressures in the population, we propose the hypothesis that essential hypertension is the consequence of different combinations of genetic variations that are individually of little consequence. The candidate gene approach to finding relevant genes is exemplified by studies that identified potentially causative variations associated with quantitative differences in the expression of the angiotensinogen gene (AGT). Experiments to test causation directly are possible in mice, and we describe their use to establish that blood pressures are indeed altered by genetic changes in AGT expression. Tests of differences in expression of the genes coding for the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and for the natriuretic peptide receptor A are also considered, and we provide a tabulation of all comparable experiments in mice. Computer simulations are presented that resolve the paradoxical finding that while ACE inhibitors are effective, genetic variations in the expression of the ACE gene do not affect blood pressure. We emphasize the usefulness of studying animals heterozygous for an inactivating mutation and a wild-type allele, and briefly discuss a way of establishing causative links between complex phenotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms.",

Blood pressure (BP) was measured at home on two separate occasions following a standardised protocol. Persons taking antihypertensive drugs or with BP values > or = 140/90 mm Hg were considered as affected by hypertension. Prevalence of hypertension was 64.8%, with higher rates in women than men, and in those aged 75-84 than in those aged 65-74. Diabetes, strokes and hypercholesterolaemia were more frequent in hypertensive than normotensive people, whereas cardiac diseases, overweight and smoking did not differ significantly between hypertensive and normotensive people. Of the 669 hypertensive patients, 439 (65.6%) were aware of their hypertension, 398 (59.5%) were being treated, and 70 (10.5%) had their hypertension controlled. Of the 230 unaware patients, 201 (87.4%) had had their BP measured in the previous year. Of these, 174 (86.6%) had stage 1 hypertension, while 27 had stage 2 hypertension with SBP values <170 mm Hg. Overall, the patients with stage 1 hypertension accounted for 68.3% of the untreated and 50.5% of the treated patients. The use of a single drug was more frequent in patients with controlled (97.1%) or stage 1 (97.0%) than with stages 2-3 (18.9%) hypertension. The drugs prescribed most were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (45%), followed by diuretics (43%). As our findings suggest that BP values can be effectively reduced by treating or increasing drug treatment in stage 1 hypertensive patients, data on safety and effectiveness of this policy are urgently needed.

    "321": "New therapeutic strategies as well as the development of drugs with more specific targets have been fueled by disappointments in the treatment of adult heart failure. Calcium sensitizers, vesnarinone and angiotensin channel blockers will be addressed in this manuscript. The physiologic and pharmacologic principles that justify their use in the management of heart failure are reviewed. Calcium sensitizers increase myocardial contractility and in part they bypass the adenylyl cyclase cascade, which gives them a more favorable energy profile. Vesnarinone is a quinolinone derivative with ion channel modulation properties, which result in a positive inotropic effect and prolongation of the action potential. In addition vesnarinone has immunomodulatory properties. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the cornerstones for the treatment of heart failure. The discovery of some putative drawbacks to ACE inhibition has challenged this supremacy. Angiotensin receptor blockers have been developed hoping to overcome these deficiencies. Myocardial developmental differences highlight the shortcomings of attempting to extrapolate data on drugs and cellular physiology in adults to children. Studies are needed addressing standards of care, quality of life, morbidity and mortality, neurohumoral activation, its modulation and the consequences of these therapies in pediatric heart failure.",

ACE inhibitors may be used to treat infants, children and adolescents with asymptomatic and symptomatic ventricular dysfunction as well. The data supporting their use in children is less complete than that concerning the treatment of adults.

The total mortality rate was significantly, often synergistically, decreased compared to the COCA-only group when the appropriate CV drugs were combined with the AC drugs: PRA 5 mg/kg in the EtOH-cotreated groups, PRA 5 mg/kg, PHEN 5 mg/kg or ENA 10 mg/kg in the DZP-cotreated groups, and NIMO 5 mg/kg, PRA 5 mg/kg, PHEN 5 mg/kg, or PRO 10 mg/kg in the PHB-cotreated groups. The decrease in the COCA concentration in the blood and/or brain was not always accompanied by an attenuation of the mortality rate. However, the attenuation of severe seizures by a single PRA, PHEN, DZP, or PHB cotreatment was accompanied by a decrease in the brain COCA concentration.", 
    "348": "We investigated the role of kinin and nitric oxide (NO) in the modulation of cardiac O(2)consumption in Syrian hamsters with overt heart failure (HF) and age-matched normal hamsters. Using echocardiography, the hamsters with heart failure had reduced ejection fraction [31(+/-8) v 76(+/-5)%] and LV dilation [4.9(+/-0. 2) v 5.7(+/-0.3) mm, both P<0.05 from normal]. O(2)consumption in the left ventricular free wall was measured using a Clark-type O(2)electrode in an air-tight chamber, containing Krebs solution buffered with Hepes (37 degrees C, pH 7.4). Concentration response curves to bradykinin (BK), ramiprilat (RAM), amlodipine (AMLO) and the NO donor, S -nitroso- N -acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) were performed. Basal myocardial O(2)consumption was lower in the HF group compared to normal [316(+/-21) v 404(+/-36) nmol O(2)/min/g, respectively, P<0.05]. In the hearts from normal hamsters BK (10(-4)mol/l), RAM (10(-4)mol/l), and AMLO (10(-5)mol/l) all significantly reduced myocardial O(2)consumption by 42(+/-6)%, 29(+/-7)% and 27(+/-5)% respectively. This reduction was attenuated in the presence of N -nitro- l -arginine methyl ester (l -NAME) [BK: 3.3(+/-1.5)%, RAM: 3.3(+/-1.2)%, AMLO: 2.3(+/-1.2)%, P<0.05]. Interestingly in the hearts from HF group, BK, RAM and AMLO caused a significantly smaller reduction in myocardial O(2)consumption [10(+/-2)%, 2.5(+/-1.3)%, 6.3(+/-2.3)%, P<0.05]. In contrast, the NO donor SNAP reduced myocardial O(2)consumption in both groups and all those responses were not affected by l -NAME. These data indicate that endogenous NO production through the kinin-dependent mechanism is impaired at end-stage heart failure. The loss of kinin and NO control of mitochondrial respiration may contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure.", 
    "349": "The cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel is potentially composed of an inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir6.1 and/or Kir6.2) subunit and the cardiac type of sulfonylurea receptor (SUR2A). We reported that cardiac Kir6.1 mRNA and protein are specifically upregulated in the non-ischemic as well as the ischemic regions in rats with myocardial ischemia, suggesting that humoral and/or hemodynamic factors are responsible for this regulation. In the present study, pretreatment with TCV-116, an angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor antagonist, completely inhibited the upregulation of Kir6.1 mRNA and protein expression in both regions of rat hearts subjected to 60 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion; whereas pretreatment with lisinopril, an Ang converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, partly inhibited this upregulation. Except for rats pretreated with TCV-116, Kir6.1 mRNA levels were positively correlated with those for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a molecular indicator of regional wall stress, in both the non-ischemic and the ischemic regions. Plasma Ang II levels were not elevated in rats with control myocardial ischemia compared with sham rats. Thus, the stress-related induction of cardiac Kir6.1 mRNA and protein expression under myocardial ischemia is inhibited by pretreatment with an AT1 antagonist, but also in part by an ACE inhibitor, suggesting that activation of local renin-angiotensin system may play a role.",

    "362": "Chronic heart failure is a multi-etiological cardiovascular disorder with high prevalence and poor prognosis. Medical treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy is aimed at alleviating heart failure symptoms. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and very recently, beta-blockers have been shown to have favorable effects on symptoms, exercise capacity and mortality. Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 are involved in several physiological processes such as the control of muscle mass and function, body composition and regulation of nutrient metabolism. The role of GH and IGF-1 as modulators of myocardial structure and function is well established. Receptors for both GH and IGF-1 are expressed by cardiac myocytes; therefore, GH may act directly on the heart or via the induction of local or systemic IGF-1, while IGF-1 may act by endocrine, paracrine or autocrine mechanisms. Patients with acromegaly have an increased propensity to develop ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular diseases; impaired cardiac efficiency can also be observed in patients with GH deficiency. Animal models of pressure and volume overload have demonstrated up-regulation of cardiac IGF-1 production and expression of GH and IGF-1 receptors, implying that the local regulation of these factors is influenced by hemodynamic changes. Moreover, experimental studies suggest that GH and IGF-1 have stimulatory effects on myocardial contractility, possibly mediated by changes in intracellular calcium handling. Heart failure is due to ventricular dilation with inadequate wall thickening that leads to impaired cardiac performance; therefore, based on previous evidence we would expect beneficial effects from the use of GH in these patients. Several papers have highlighted the positive influence of GH in the regulation of heart development and performance. In patients with GH deficiency, GH administration dramatically improves cardiac function. In small open studies, acute and chronic GH treatment has demonstrated beneficial effects in patients with heart failure due to ischemic or idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Recently, two randomized, placebo-controlled studies did not show any significant GH-mediated improvement in cardiac performance in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, despite significant increases in IGF-1. Acquired GH resistance might be an important feature of severe heart failure and explain the diverse responses to GH therapy observed in different patients. Whether GH treatment will finally find a place in the treatment of heart failure, and with which modalities, remains to be established.",

The present study examined the effect of 2 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise training on the recovery of the autonomic nervous activity, exercise capacity, and cardiac output (CO) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Twenty-eight patients were randomly divided into the training group or the control group and performed exercise tests at 1 week, 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after CABG. The HRV was measured, and the high-frequency component of HRV was used as an index of parasympathetic nerve activity (PNA); the plasma norepinephrine concentration (NE) was used as an index of sympathetic nervous activity. Cardiac output was also measured. In the training group, peak VO2, peak CO and PNA during exercise had improved at 3 weeks, but there was no improvement in these indices in the control group. NE decreased 1 week after CABG in both groups. These results indicate that physical training soon after CABG improves not only the exercise capacity, but also PNA.",

    "380": "The aim of this study was to explore the possible participation of cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the ischemia-reperfusion induced changes in heart function as well as Ca2+-handling activities and gene expression of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins. The isolated rat hearts, treated for 10 min without and with 30 microM captopril or 100 microM losartan, were subjected to 30 min ischemia followed by reperfusion for 60 min and processed for the measurement of SR function and gene expression. Attenuated recovery of the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) upon reperfusion of the ischemic heart was accompanied by a marked reduction in SR Ca2+-pump ATPase, Ca2+-uptake and Ca2+-release activities. Northern blot analysis revealed that mRNA levels for SR Ca2+-handling proteins such as Ca2+-pump ATPase (SERCA2a), ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin and phospholamban were decreased in the ischemia-reperfused heart as compared with the non-ischemic control. Treatment with captopril improved the recovery of LVDP as well as SR Ca2+-pump ATPase and Ca2+-uptake activities in the postischemic hearts but had no effect on changes in Ca2+-release activity due to ischemic-reperfusion. Losartan neither affected the changes in contractile function nor modified alterations in SR Ca2+-handling activities. The ischemia-reperfusion induced decrease in mRNA levels for SR Ca2+-handling proteins were not affected by treatment with captopril or losartan. The results suggest that the improvement of cardiac function in the ischemic-reperfused heart by captopril is associated with the preservation of SR Ca2+-pump activities; however, it is unlikely that this action of captopril is mediated through the modification of cardiac RAS. Furthermore, cardiac RAS does not appear to contribute towards the ischemia-reperfusion induced changes in gene expression for SR Ca2+-handling proteins.", 
    "381": "Besides the reduction of angiotensin II formation, locally increased kinins may play a role in the cardiovascular action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. To characterize the contribution of bradykinin to the effects of ACE inhibition by captopril on the development of pressure overload hypertrophy, sham-operated rats and rats with ascending aortic constriction were treated with captopril (80 mg/kg/day) or captopril and B2 kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 7 weeks. Left ventricular mass and geometry, hydroxyproline concentration and myosin isozymes (marker of a fetal phenotype) were assessed. Rats with aortic constriction exhibited a marked increase in left ventricular weight and diastolic pressure-volume relationship was shifted to smaller volumes. Signs of congestive heart failure were not apparent. The hydroxyproline concentration remained unaltered. However, the proportion of isomyosin V3 was increased (p < 0.05). Administration of captopril reduced (p < 0.05) systolic blood pressure, body and cardiac weight in all treated rats. The reduction of left ventricular weight was disproportionally higher in pressure overloaded rats, thus the relative left ventricular weight decreased by 15% (p < 0.05). Captopril augmented the isomyosin V1 expression (p < 0.05) in sham operated as well as pressure overloaded rats. The isomyosin V1 percentage was inversely related to the relative left ventricular weight. Two different (p < 0.05) correlation lines were detected for untreated and captopril treated rats. None of captopril associated effects were removed by simultaneously administered B, kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140. Thus, stimulation of bradykinin B2 receptor appears not to mediate the effects of captopril on cardiac growth and contractile proteins during the development of pressure overload hypertrophy.", 
    "382": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), the primary effector of the renin-angiotensin system, is a multifunctional hormone that plays an important role in vascular function. In addition to its classical vasoconstrictor action, more recent studies demonstrated that Ang II stimulates the growth of a number of cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) (reviewed in [1-3]). In vivo studies have shown that chronic infusion of Ang II leads to the development of vascular hypertrophy in rats, whereas administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or Ang II receptor antagonists prevents or regresses vascular hypertrophy in models of genetic and experimental hypertension [4]. Consistent with in vivo data, several laboratories have shown that Ang II stimulates protein synthesis and induces cellular hypertrophy, but not cell proliferation, in cultured aortic SMC [5-9]. Ang II also induces directed migration (chemotaxis) of vascular SMC [10, 11], although its effect is less prominent than that of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The cellular mechanisms underlying these diverse actions of Ang II are not clearly understood but are likely to involve the activation of distinct signaling pathways.",

The most critical parameter is the pH of the running buffer. The addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate had a negative influence on the peak symmetry, and selectivity was not improved. The separation of the eight compounds can be performed by means of two phosphate buffers (each 100 mM) at pH 7.0 and pH 6.25, respectively.

    "394": "We report the case of a 78-year-old hypertensive diabetic patient without evidence of renal artery stenosis who had moderate chronic renal insufficiency, which had been stable for several years under low-dose captopril therapy, and who rapidly developed acute renal failure when irbesartan was prescribed. Unfortunately the medication was not stopped promptly and the patient never recovered his basal renal function and had to undergo chronic hemodialysis. This observation emphasizes the importance of a careful monitoring of renal function in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor antagonists.", 
    "395": "This study investigated the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril on left ventricular (LV) remodeling and cardiac function in rats with aortic regurgitation (AR). Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats in which AR was produced by closed-chest aortic valve puncture were divided into untreated and perindopril-treated (5 mg/kg/day) rats. Ten control rats were sham-operated. Blood pressure, body weight, and echocardiographic recordings were followed every 2 weeks for a period of 12 weeks. LV dimension (LVD) and fractional shortening (FS) were calculated. The heart was finally excised for weight, hydroxyproline measurements, and histopathology. At 12 weeks, end-diastolic LVD increased in untreated rats (10.8 +/- 0.2 mm) but did not dilate in treated rats (9.6 +/- 0.3 mm, p < 0.01 vs untreated rats). FS decreased from 6 weeks in untreated rats (27.3 +/- 0.9% at 12 weeks), but did not change in treated rats (33.8 +/- 0.5%, p < 0.001). The ratio of LV weight to body weight in untreated rats (2.62 +/- 0.11 mg/g, p < 0.05) was higher than in sham-operated rats (1.52 +/- 0.02 mg/g) and than in treated rats (1.95 +/- 0.07 mg/g). Interstitial collagen accumulation histopathologically increased in untreated rats and was inhibited in treated rats. LV collagen of untreated rats (1.46 +/- 0.08 mg/100 mg, p = 0.03) was higher than those of treated (1.08 +/- 0.09 mg/100 mg) and sham-operated rats (1.06 +/- 0.14 mg/100 mg). Perindopril inhibited LV remodeling induced by volume overload and preserved LV function in AR rats.", 
    "396": "Blood pressure and proteinuria are important determinants of progressive renal failure in patients with renal diseases. In a 53-year-old man with hypertension and nephrotic-range proteinuria, lowering the blood pressure to a value of 125/75 mmHg resulted in a disappearance of the proteinuria. Recent literature data indicate that the treatment of blood pressure in patients with proteinuria, with emphasis on the benefits of reaching a blood pressure target of 125/75 mmHg and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may lead to a serious improvement in their prognosis.", 
    "397": "The objective of this study was to explore explanations for the preference of physicians to prescribe beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women. A qualitative study among 12 family physicians was conducted with a combination of written case simulations, semi-structured interviews and statements on attitudes of physicians towards antihypertensive drug choice. Among the male hypertensive cases the most frequently prescribed drugs were beta-blockers, whereas among the female hypertensive cases diuretics were more often prescribed. Physician characteristics associated with a preferred prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women were: older age (no residency in family medicine), the believe that beta-blockers are more effective in men with regard to lowering blood pressure and that diuretics are more effective in women, a non-evidence based attitude and a sex-related attitude towards the choice of beta-blockers and diuretics in general, and in particular towards the prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men because men have a higher absolute risk of coronary heart disease than women. An additional explanation for these findings may be the higher prevalence of ankle oedema among women. Patient characteristics associated with more prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women were: current employment and a \"high-risk\" profile in terms of blood pressure level and additional cardiovascular risk factors. Although, most considerations underlying a preferred prescribing of beta-blockers to hypertensive men and diuretics to hypertensive women were not evidence-based, the actual choice of antihypertensive drug (diuretic or beta-blocker) was evidence-based. These considerations may also play a role in the sex difference in the choice of calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and require further investigation.", 
    "398": "Sudden cardiac death, which accounts for approximately 350,000 deaths each year, is a major health care problem. Antiarrhythmic drugs have not been reliable in preventing sudden cardiac death. Although beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and revascularization play a role in prevention of sudden cardiac death, the development and subsequent refinement of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator has made the most important contribution to its management. Several randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated improved survival in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Two recent trials also suggest a role for primary prevention in selected patients with coronary artery disease, ventricular dysfunction, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in whom sustained ventricular tachycardia is induced. Further technological refinements and development of new, more sensitive risk stratifiers with a higher positive predictive value for sudden cardiac death will expand the indications for this life-saving therapy.", 
    "399": "The unblocked hexapeptidic Trypsin Modulating Oostatic Factor of the fleshfly, an inhibitor of both trypsin and ecdysone biosynthesis, resists very well proteolytic breakdown by enzymes present in the lumen of the gut of previtellogenic fleshflies. However, when incubated in hemolymph of adult flies, females and males, its half-life time is a mere 0.5 min. In hemolymph of last instar larvae, this value increases to about 1.5 min. Whereas PMSF, a potent inhibitor of serine proteases has no effect, captopril and lisinopril, both known to be specific inhibitors of mammalian angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), effectively inhibit TMOF breakdown in fly hemolymph. Digestion of Neb-TMOF by recombinant Drosophila AnCE on itself results in identical degradation products as with total hemolymph. In both cases ESI-Qq-oa-Tof mass spectrometry demonstrated the appearance of peptide fragments with the sequences NPTN, LH and NP. These observations not only confirm the reported presence of circulating ACE-like activity in flies but also strongly suggest that in flies this hemolymph ACE-like activity might be involved in the regulation of the oostatic activity as exerted by Neb-TMOF.", 
    "400": "In the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) fetal growth and metabolism are abnormal. It has been speculated that maternal hypertension may be the cause of these abnormalities. Captopril treatment, which reduces maternal blood pressure, during pregnancy and lactation, is reported to have a beneficial effect postnatally, normalizing the blood pressure of offspring in the SHR. In the present study, the effects of maternal captopril treatment on fetal growth and plasma metabolites were investigated in the fetuses of two rat strains (SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY)), in order to determine whether normalizing maternal blood pressure also normalized abnormalities in fetal growth and metabolism. On fetal Day 20, SHR fetuses were lighter and placentae were heavier than for the corresponding WKY. Captopril had no effect on fetal weight in the SHR, but decreased it in the WKY. There was no effect of captopril on placental weight. Fetal plasma insulin levels were higher in the SHR than in the WKY and were decreased by captopril treatment in both strains. Fetal blood glucose was elevated and fetal blood lactate was decreased in captopril-treated litters from both strains. Captopril had no effect on fetal plasma IGF-1 but fetal plasma IGF-2 levels were lower in the captopril-treated SHR than in the captopril-treated WKY. These findings suggest that maternal captopril treatment decreases insulin secretion in the fetal rat. High levels of fetal plasma insulin suggest that the SHR fetus is insulin resistant. Fetal insulin levels may contribute to the adverse consequences of gestational captopril treatment observed in many species. The differences in the effect of captopril on the two strains suggest that there are underlying endocrine differences in the SHR.", 
    "401": "Chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis is reported to induce the thickening of coronary artery walls and cardiac hypertrophy in vivo via angiotensin II receptors. Increased protein synthesis is the main feature of these structural changes. Activation of 70 kD S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylates the 40S ribosomal protein S6 that regulates protein synthesis. We examined the role of p70S6K in the vascular and myocardial structural changes induced by the chronic inhibition of NO synthesis. The following 5 groups were studied: untreated Wister-Kyoto rats, those treated with an inhibitor of NO synthase, Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), those treated with L-NAME and an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (imidapril), those treated with L-NAME and hydralazine, and those treated with L-NAME and an inhibitor of p70S6K (rapamycin). After 8 weeks, wall-to-lumen ratio in myocardium and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas were quantified. L-NAME increased systolic blood pressure, wall-to-lumen ratio, and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area compared with control animals. Imidapril or rapamycin, but not hydralazine, markedly reduced these structural changes. L-NAME increased p70S6K activity in myocardium compared with control rats. Imidapril or rapamycin prevented the activation of p70S6K activity in myocardium induced by L-NAME. These results suggest that activation of p70S6K plays an important role in coronary vascular remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy induced by the chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis in vivo.", 
    "402": "The renin-angiotensin system plays a critical role in regulating vasoconstriction and vasodilatation that can influence myocardial blood flow and its transmural distribution. We tested the hypothesis that angiotensin inhibition can induce a leftward shift of the coronary autoregulatory pressure-flow relation and preserve distribution of myocardial blood flow at lower coronary perfusion pressures. We established circumflex artery pressure-flow relations under baseline conditions and after intracoronary enalaprilat or losartan potassium. Thereafter, transmural myocardial blood flow was measured at baseline and at the lower coronary pressure limit (LPL). With enalaprilat, the LPL was shifted leftward from 48 +/- 6 mmHg at baseline to 43 +/- 3 mmHg (P = 0.026); with losartan, the LPL was shifted leftward from 48 +/- 10 mmHg at baseline to 41 +/- 5 mmHg (P = 0.027). The leftward shift occurred while cardiac hemodynamics and MVO2 were maintained at control levels. These results indicate that angiotensin inhibition extends the range of coronary autoregulation to lower LPL while preserving myocardial blood flow distribution, a physiologic effect that might explain the lower incidence of coronary events in treated patients.", 
    "403": "Considerable evidence now exists that inflammation is a central component of events that initiate and propagate an acute coronary syndrome. This process evokes the potential for embolization, which occurs more often than previously suspected, and imparts poor cardiovascular prognosis. Recent development of techniques to detect inflammation and embolization represents an important advance. In addition, therapies that diminish occurrence of these phenomena such as aspirin, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists have been shown to improve outlook.",

    "416": "Heart failure affects more than 5 million Americans. Each year, about 400,000 individuals develop heart failure, making it the nation's most rapidly growing cardiac problem. Almost one third of these individuals have New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV heart failure and are faced with progressive clinical deterioration and frequent hospital admissions. These figures will continue to escalate as the population ages. The success of interventional procedures and pharmacologic therapies in the management of coronary artery disease has enabled this population to survive acute events, at the same time creating a population with chronic disease. Common etiologies of heart failure in women include coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and valvular disease. However, women are at especially high risk for developing heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes. Heart failure in women is best managed across the care continuum, incorporating pharmacologic agents, interventional procedures when appropriate, dietary restrictions, self-monitoring, and psychosocial support. Much of the recent literature has focused on women and heart disease. This emphasis is partly due to public misconception about women's health problems and the growing body of research distinguishing gender differences. Significant advances in therapy have been made to improve the quality and span of life for people with heart disease. Despite therapeutic advances, however, women have high mortality rates from heart disease, including heart failure due to ischemic causes. In fact, women with heart failure present differently than men and have different etiologies and treatment options. As we learn more about women and heart disease, the distinguishing differences unfold and become helpful in establishing a plan of care.", 
    "417": "Mononuclear cells accumulate in the renal interstitium and contribute to renal injury in proteinuric nephropathies. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce protein trafficking and also lessen renal structural and functional damage. Many proinflammatory genes, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a chemoattractant for monocytes and T lymphocytes, are transcriptionally regulated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). We aimed to study NF-kB activation and MCP-1 expression over time in two models of progressive proteinuric nephropathies (5/6 nephrectomy and passive Heymann nephritis [PHN]) and evaluate the effect of antiproteinuric therapy with an ACE inhibitor on these factors. In both models, increased urinary protein excretion over time was associated with a remarkable increase in NF-kB activity, which was almost completely suppressed by reducing proteinuria with lisinopril. NF-kB activation was paralleled by upregulation of MCP-1 messenger RNA and interstitial accumulation of ED-1-positive monocytes/macrophages and CD8-positive T cells. Lisinopril inhibited MCP-1 upregulation and limited interstitial inflammation. In a group of PHN rats with advanced disease and severe proteinuria, a dose of lisinopril high enough to inhibit renal ACE activity failed to reduce proteinuria and also did not limit NF-kB activation, which was sustained over time, along with MCP-1 gene overexpression and interstitial inflammation. These data suggest that NF-kB is activated in the presence of increased protein traffic, enhancing the nuclear transcription of the MCP-1 gene with potent chemotactic and inflammatory properties. This mechanism may help explain the long-term renal toxicity of filtered proteins.", 
    "418": "The T235 allele of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene is associated with plasma AGT concentration and pregnancy-induced hypertension. The aim of this study was to compare changes in the circulating renin-angiotensin system after short-term (2 days) and repeated (7 days) administration of 50 microg ethinylestradiol (EE) in homozygous normotensive men (TT and MM). After repeated EE administration, renin stimulation was induced by a single oral dose of 40 mg furosemide, followed by 50 mg captopril, 12 h later. The short-term administration of EE did not induce a significant differential genotype-dependent increase in AGT concentration. In the 7-day study, TT subjects had higher peak plasma AGT concentrations than MM subjects. The more pronounced AGT increase in TT subjects resulted in similar plasma renin activity at a lower plasma active renin concentration, with a higher plasma renin activity/active renin ratio. The difference between genotypes in renin secretion resulted in readjustment of angiotensins production. In conclusion, the T235 allele of the AGT gene is associated with greater stimulation of AGT secretion in plasma after EE administration. In the short-term, complete readjustment of the circulating renin-angiotensin system occurs, through a decrease in renin release, which blunts the effects of the increase in AGT concentration.", 
    "419": "There is a rapid development of the 'second wave epidemic' of cardiovascular disease that is now flowing through developing countries and the former socialist republics. It is now evident from WHO data that coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are increasing so rapidly that they will rank No. 1 and No. 5 respectively as causes of global burden by the year 2020. In spite of the current low prevalence of hypertensive subjects in some countries, the total number of hypertensive subjects in the developing world is high, and a cost-analysis of possible antihypertensive drug treatment indicates that developing countries cannot afford the same treatment as developed countries. Control of hypertension in the USA is only 20% (blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg). In Africa only 5-10% have a blood pressure control of hypertension of <140/90 mm Hg. There are varying responses to antihypertensive therapy in black hypertensive patients. Black patients respond well to thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers vasodilators like alpha-blockers, hydralazine, reserpine and poorly to beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and All receptor antagonists unless they are combined with a diuretic. A comprehensive cardiovascular disease (CVD) programme in Africa is necessary. There are social, economic, cultural factors which impair control of hypertension in developing countries. Hypertension control is ideally suited to the initial component on an integrated CVD control programme which has to be implemented. Primary prevention, through a population-based lifestyle linked programme, as well as cost-effective methods of detection and management are synergistically linked. The existing health care infrastructure needs to be orientated to meet the emerging challenge of CVD, while empowering the community through health education.", 
    "420": "The vascular endothelium synthesizes and releases a spectrum of vasoactive substances like nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin (ET). In hypertension, the delicate balance of endothelium-derived factors is disturbed. ET acts as the natural counterpart to endothelium-derived NO, which exerts vasodilating, antithrombotic, and antiproliferative effects, and inhibits leukocyte-adhesion to the vascular wall. Besides its blood pressure rising effect also in man, ET induces vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The derangement of endothelial function in hypertension is likely to be caused in part by genetic factors, but also due to elevated blood pressure itself. Due to its position between blood pressure and smooth muscle cells responsible for peripheral resistance, the endothelium is thought to be both target and mediator of arterial hypertension. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Superoxide anions, ie, oxygen radicals produced in part by angiotensin II-activated NAD(P)H oxidase, can scavenge NO to form peroxynitrite, which can nitrosylate membrane proteins and oxidize lipids. Another source of superoxide is cyclooxygenase. Paradoxically, dysfunctional endothelial NO synthase may also be a source of superoxide anions. Surprisingly and in contrast to animal experiments, not all antihypertensive treatments consistently restore endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with arterial hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction in hypertension is crucial both for the development of the disease process in the vasculature and an important therapeutic target.", 
    "421": "Ischaemic and degenerative brain diseases are a major health problem leading to a devastating loss of autonomy. Hypertension has been shown to carry an increased risk not only for cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality but also for cognitive impairment and dementia. Although diastolic blood pressure is considered an important risk factor, it is now clear that isolated systolic hypertension and elevated pulse pressure also play an important role in the development of brain complications. Therefore the treatment of these conditions must urgently become a widespread tool of prevention. All the randomised placebo-controlled trials completed for the last 30 years have shown a reduction in fatal and/or non-fatal strokes. In the most recent trials in isolated systolic hypertension in older patients, the benefit was even greater because of the higher risk in these populations. The new classes of drugs, in particular, calcium-channels blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have been shown to be as effective as the originally used diuretics and beta-blockers. Active treatment in the Syst-Eur trial based on nitrendipine as first step, possibly associated with enalapril and/or hydrochlorthiazide reduced not only stroke and cardiovascular complications but also the incidence of dementia including Alzheimer's disease. This important finding must be confirmed by further trials specifically focusing on the prevention of dementia. In addition, the importance of pulse pressure as a risk factor, underlines the need for new drugs which could increase aortic distensibility and decrease systolic blood pressure without greatly reducing diastolic pressure. Improving the management of hypertension offers new opportunities to reduce age-related disease in older people and to promote healthy aging.", 
    "422": "It has been clearly demonstrated that left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a strong blood pressure independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population, in primary and secondary hypertension and in cardiac patients. LV hypertrophy in arterial hypertension develops in response to an increased afterload, but underlying pathophysiological mechanisms include a variety of non-haemodynamic factors. Due to the prognostic importance of LV hypertrophy, normalisation of LV mass emerged as a desirable goal of antihypertensive treatment. Indeed, several prospective studies now indicate that regression of LV hypertrophy reduced cardiovascular complications. As a consequence, the question was raised whether certain antihypertensive drugs differ in their ability to reduce LV mass. Several comparative studies and meta-analyses have been carried out to resolve this issue. The available data seem to indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were more potent than beta-blockers in their ability to reduce LV hypertrophy, with diuretics in the intermediate range. The role of new antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockers appears similar to the one of ACE-inhibitors, since in some studies angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockers were superior to beta-blockers and diuretics. Various aspects of LV hypertrophy including its prevalence, determinants, prognosis and regression are discussed in this article.", 
    "423": "Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) exerts a renoprotective effect in adult patients with chronic kidney disease. We evaluated prospectively changes in blood pressure (BP), protein excretion and renal function after administration of the long-acting ACE inhibitor ramipril as monotherapy during 6 months in 14 moderately hypertensive children aged 5-18 years with various nephropathies. Four patients initially had a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). BP was evaluated by ambulatory 24-h monitoring. After 2 weeks of treatment by oral ramipril (1.5 mg/m2 once daily), mean values of systolic and diastolic 24-h ambulatory BP fell by more than 5 mmHg in nine patients. In eight patients the dose was doubled. At the end of the study systolic BP was below the 95th percentile in 9 and diastolic BP in 13 patients. The initially reduced nocturnal dip increased significantly. Of 11 patients with an increased albumin excretion (median 1.3 g/g creatinine), 6 responded to ramipril by a median reduction of 78% (range 24-83%), whilst in 5 albuminuria increased (median +19%). GFR was well preserved and no other adverse effects from the drug were noted. The study demonstrates that ramipril is an efficacious antihypertensive agent in children with renal hypertension. It is well tolerated, even in mild renal insufficiency. In addition, the drug has a persistent antiproteinuric action in about half of the patients contributing to conserve renal function.",

Thirteen small, randomized controlled trials had inadequate power to rule in or rule out moderate-to-large (20%-50%) benefits of antihypertensive treatment. Possible adverse effects were fetal renal failure when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are used in the second or third trimester and growth restriction when atenolol is used early in pregnancy.

    "429": "The high frequency of restenosis after percutaneous coronary angioplasty is still a major clinical problem. It occurs in 30% to 60% of patients and limits the long-term success of angioplasty. Many clinical trials have been conducted to resolve this problem, using a wide range of pharmacologic agents such as antiplatelet agents, anticoagulation drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, anti-inflammatory drugs, and antiproliferative drugs. Thus far, no effective drug has been reported, with the exception of probucol, which unfortunately is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration because it prolongs the QT time, and possibly trapidil and cilostazol, two agents that are currently being tested in larger trials. Stent implantation has significantly reduced the frequency of restenosis in patients with 1) short lesions in large coronary arteries, (> 3.0 mm), 2) native coronary restenosis lesions, 3) venous bypass graft obstructions, 4) chronic total occlusions, and 5) acute myocardial infarction in patients referred for primary percutaneous intervention. A significant problem is the occurrence of in-stent restenosis because it is associated with a high recurrence of restenosis, after repeat coronary intervention irrespective of the technique or device used. Brachytherapy may limit this problem. The high restenosis rate occurring in long lesions and in small vessels still remains an unresolved issue.",

Treatment should be targeted at symptoms, causal clinical disease, and underlying basic mechanisms. Symptom-targeted therapy: decrease pulmonary venous pressure using diuretics and long-acting nitrates, maintain atrial contraction and atrial ventricular synchrony, reduce heart rate using beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers; increase exercise tolerance by reducing exercise- induced increases in blood pressure and heart rate using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Disease-targeted therapy: prevent or treat myocardial ischemia, prevent or regress left ventricular hypertrophy. Mechanism-targeted therapy (future directions): modify neurohumoral activation using renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone system antagonists (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockade, aldosterone and renin antagonist); endothelin antagonists; nitric oxide agonists; and atrial natruretic peptide agonists; alter intracellular mechanisms; alter extracellular matrix structures.", 
    "431": "Of the three major functional categories of cardiomyopathies (dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive), the restrictive cardiomyopathies (RCMs) are the least common in the Western world, but unfortunately often are associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality. Infiltrative disease of the myocardium (often caused by amyloidosis) is a common cause of RCMs and has a significantly lower long-term survival rate when compared to cardiomyopathies of various other causes. Treatment of the RCM is, in general, difficult and often ineffective. Because of the abnormalities of diastolic filling that are characteristic of this condition, general measures to reduce venous and systemic congestion such as with the use of diuretics, are desirable but often result in an attendant reduction in stroke volume and cardiac output. Digoxin, calcium channel blocking drugs, and beta-adrenergic blocking agents are of limited value, although they may be used with benefit to control the heart rate response in the subgroup of patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are generally ineffective in RCM. Targeted therapy directed against specific causal entities (such as the use of somatostatin analogues in carcinoid syndrome or iron chelation with desferrioxamine in hemochromatosis) may be more effective than simple symptomatic therapy. Differentiation of RCM from constrictive pericarditis is crucial, since constriction may be treated effectively by surgical removal of the thickened pericardium. A limited number of patients appear to have benefited from novel treatment strategies, such as autologous stem cell transplant in amyloidosis, balloon valvuloplasty of stenotic tricuspid or pulmonary valves in cardiac carcinoid syndrome, and cardiac transplantation. Truly effective therapy for RCM is generally lacking, and the best chance for optimizing the clinical outcome is early detection and aggressive medical treatment in an attempt to maintain the highest possible level of patient function for as long as possible.", 
    "432": "Myocarditis and its sequela, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), cause substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in children and young adults. Physicians should include myocarditis in the differential diagnosis of all patients who have new symptoms of heart failure, arrhythmia, or chest pain syndromes of unclear cause, and should strongly consider performing endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) to establish the diagnosis. It may be necessary to perform multiple or serial biopsies to increase sensitivity. Patients with myocarditis and symptomatic heart failure, chest pain, or arrhythmias need hospitalization for evaluation and treatment. Patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction should be treated with conventional heart failure therapy, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digitalis, diuretics, and beta-blockers. Patients with arrhythmias or syncope may require electrophysiologic evaluation. In addition to conventional therapy, physicians should consider a course of immunosuppressive therapy in selected patients. The clinical course, response to therapy, and left ventricular function need close monitoring. Patients with myocarditis and rapidly progressive heart failure or cardiogenic shock should be referred early to an advanced heart failure center for implantation of a ventricular assist device and consideration for cardiac transplantation.", 
    "433": "Secondary and infiltrative cardiomyopathies are the least common forms of cardiomyopathy and often are the most difficult to treat. In all cases, efforts should be made to establish a specific diagnosis because the removal or avoidance of the causative agent (eg, alcohol, cocaine, persistent tachycardia) holds the best promise for reversal of ventricular dysfunction. Patients who present with a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) should be treated with standard heart failure therapy. However, the \"standard\" is changing and clinicians need to take heed of results of recent trials establishing the role of beta-blockers, aldosterone, and angiotensin receptor antagonists in addition to the regimen of digoxin, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In contrast, patients who present with a more infiltrative clinical picture often manifest more diastolic dysfunction and need strict volume control to maintain euvolemia. For patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis, immunosuppressive therapy generally should be considered in an effort to maintain and potentially improve ventricular function. Patients with sarcoid heart disease have shown the greatest response to high-dose corticosteroids. Patients with hemochromatosis related cardiomyopathy should be treated with iron chelation therapy and phlebotomy. The role of cardiac transplantation is limited, as most of the secondary and infiltrative causes of cardiomyopathy are associated with an adverse posttransplant outcome. Other surgical options, such as left ventricular assist devices, may offer hope to patients who would otherwise be ineligible for cardiac transplantation. On the horizon, biventricular pacing and treatments targeted at cytokines and hormonal receptors hold the promise of improving symptoms and prolonging survival by counteracting the deleterious effects of these secondary mediators.", 
    "434": "Patients with stable Canadian Heart Classification I or II angina pectoris may be managed successfully with a conservative medical program. Such a program should always include aspirin, beta-blocking agents, and lipid-lowering therapies unless contraindications to them exist. Exercise and dietary restrictions will achieve target lipid values in some patients; the remainder should be treated with a lipid-lowering drug if they are at high risk of cardiac events. Emerging data support a role for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in many, if not all, patients with coronary artery disease. The role of calcium antagonists in this population remains uncertain, with some favorable and some unfavorable effects seen with these agents. High-risk patients and those with a desire to achieve greater exercise tolerance once medical therapies have been optimized are suitable candidates for angiographic study and revascularization. Although randomized studies addressing this population are limited, available data support the benefits of either coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous catheter intervention.", 
    "435": "Syndrome X, defined as typical angina with positive exercise test results and normal coronary angiographic findings, represents a multifactorial pathophysiologic state that may range from abnormalities in pain perception to abnormalities in endothelial- and nonendothelial-dependent coronary flow reserve associated with myocardial ischemia. Treatment begins with accurate diagnosis by means of a comprehensive coronary vascular reactivity evaluation. This may lay the groundwork for appropriate treatment. The management of patients with syndrome X is challenging, and it may be necessary to attempt various medications depending on the patient's response. We feel that the first step in the treatment is accurate diagnosis. This is done by performing a functional angiogram (assessment of endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent coronary flow reserve). In those without evidence of coronary flow reserve abnormalities, reassurance might be curative; however, in those who continue to have symptoms, a trial of imipramine therapy at a dose of 50 mg/d may be attempted, provided other organic disorders (in particular gastrointestinal disorders) are excluded. Those who demonstrate evidence of abnormal coronary vascular reactivity are approached as outlined in Figure 1. Patients are advised to avoid medications that may cause coronary \"spasm.\" We routinely refer our patients to the cardiovascular health clinic for risk factor management and an exercise program. Our first choice of medications usually consists of slow-release calcium channel blockers. We tend to start with a once-a-day regimen, and based on the response, we occasionally change the regimen to twice a day. If the functional angiogram reveals concomitant epicardial disease, then nitrates are added to the medical regimen. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are part of the treatment if the patient has hypertension or diabetes or if calcium channel blocker therapy fails. l-Arginine at an initial dosage of 1 g three times daily is added and may be increased to 3 g three times daily if no contraindications are present. Because there are no data regarding the effect of l-arginine, which may affect insulin secretion, in patients with diabetes, we use caution in this patient population. There is no \"gold standard\" therapy for syndrome X, so each patient may respond differently to the initial medical therapy. Thus, we follow these patients closely to monitor their response to treatment.", 
    "436": "Patients with transmural (with ST segment elevation) myocardial infarction should immediately be considered for reperfusion therapy. Fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase, alteplase, or reteplase should be started within 30 minutes of presentation for patients without bleeding risk. Alternatively, patients at tertiary care hospitals can undergo emergency coronary angioplasty. Other lifesaving pharmacologic interventions include administering aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Oxygen, morphine sulfate, heparin, and nitroglycerin are also useful. No benefit has been demonstrated for calcium channel blockers, magnesium, or prophylactic lidocaine. Patients need to be closely monitored for conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias, and heart failure.", 
    "437": "Physicians must aggressively treat heart failure in the early stages to prevent disease progression and improve survival. Early treatment implies early diagnosis of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, before the onset of symptoms. Patients with risk factors for the development of heart failure, especially coronary disease or hypertension, should undergo echocardiography to evaluate LV function. Patients with LV systolic dysfunction should be further evaluated to determine the type of cardiac dysfunction, uncover correctable etiologic factors, determine prognosis, and guide treatment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs improve survival and are integral to the treatment plan. Physicians should prescribe an ACE inhibitor as initial therapy for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction unless there are specific contraindications. The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate is an acceptable alternative therapy for patients who cannot take ACE inhibitors. Diuretics should be used if there are signs or symptoms of volume overload. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs should be added to therapy in stable patients with mild to moderate heart failure after optimal treatment with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, or other vasodilators. Digoxin should be used routinely in patients with severe heart failure and should be added to therapy in patients with mild to moderate heart failure who remain symptomatic despite optimal doses of ACE inhibitors and diuretics. Spironolactone should be added, but electrolytes should be closely monitored. Warfarin anticoagulation should be considered in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less. Until survival data exist, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be used as initial therapy or as sole therapy but can be used for ACE-intolerant patients or can be added to standard heart failure therapy. Outpatient use of intravenous inotropic therapy should be avoided. Patients with severe heart failure should have peak oxygen consumption measured to quantify functional impairment, determine prognosis, and identify the need for advanced heart failure therapy. Patients who remain symptomatic while receiving optimal standard therapy should be referred early to a specialized heart failure center.", 
    "438": "The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) as a treatable entity is of particular importance in patients with primary hypertension. Because LVH is associated with a strong risk of adverse clinical events (eg, heart failure, ischemic events, and cardiovascular death) and because evidence from retrospective studies suggests that regression of LVH, along with a decrease in blood pressure, may help modify these outcomes, the use of antihypertensive agents that have been shown to promote regression of LVH has been recommended. These include diuretics, beta-blockers (except those with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity ), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, peripheral alpha(1)-blockers, and central alpha(2)-stimulators. Agents to be avoided include direct arterial vasodilators (eg, hydralazine and minoxidil), which have strong sympathetic stimulating properties and tend to maintain LVH despite lowering blood pressure. The use of ACE inhibitors is increasing. Unfortunately, the cost of these agents is higher than that of some other classes of agents, such as diuretics, which show excellent evidence of regression of hypertrophy. African-American and elderly persons, in particular, may benefit from diuretics for treatment of hypertension as well as reduction of left ventricular (LV) mass. Beta-blockers should be considered in the elderly, especially those with greatly thickened LV walls and small chamber sizes, factors associated with hyperdynamic systolic performance, systolic midcavity obliteration, and diastolic relaxation abnormalities on echocardiography. Calcium channel blockers may also be useful in patients with LVH who have normal systolic performance and diastolic compliance abnormalities. The purpose of serial echocardiographic studies in patients already being treated for hypertension is to ensure that LV geometry has not worsened and that function is unchanged or improved (especially with respect to previously noted diastolic Doppler inflow abnormalities). Considerable changes in estimated LV mass (>60 g on serial intrapatient evaluation) are needed before the clinician can conclude with confidence that LV mass has decreased. More specific definitive recommendations based on the outcomes of current large-scale clinical trials are awaited.", 
    "439": "Survivors of an episode of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (not due to a reversible cause) or hemodynamically significant sustained ventricular tachycardia should in most cases receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) rather than antiarrhythmic drug therapy. A number of recently published clinical trials (summarized later) point to improved survival with ICD implantation. It is also important to identify the cause of the ventricular rhythm and to treat adequately the underlying cardiomyopathy with the appropriate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aspirin. The role of electrophysiologic study is a matter of debate, and it is used less commonly than it was a decade ago.", 
    "440": "The urinary podocyte is postulated to be a marker for estimation of the severity of active glomerular injury and a predictor of disease progression in children with glomerulonephritis. Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, including verapamil, reduce proteinuria to an extent similar to that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), including trandolapril, but to a greater extent than other antihypertensives. Angiotensin (Ang) II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil, show potent and long-term preventive effects against the progression of renal injury. The aim of the present study is to assess whether verapamil, trandolapril and candesartan cilexetil affect proteinuria and urinary podocytes in patients with IgA nephropathy. Thirty-two normotensive patients aged 18-54 years with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, nonnephrotic proteinuria (1-3 g/day), and normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 ml/min) were studied. Twenty patients with diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (non-IgA PGN) and 20 healthy controls were also included in this study. The number of urinary podocytes in patients with advanced IgA nephropathy (n = 16) was significantly higher than that in patients with the disease in the mild stage (n = 16) (p < 0.01) or in patients with non-IgA PGN (p < 0.01). Urinary podocytes were not detected in healthy controls. The 32 patients with IgA nephropathy were randomly divided into four treatment groups: those treated with verapamil (120 mg/day, n = 8); those treated with trandolapril (2 mg/day, n = 8); those treated with candesartan cilexetil (8 mg/day, n = 8), and those given a placebo (n = 8). Treatment continued for 3 months. Antiproteinuric response in the trandolapril group was similar to that in the candesartan cilexetil group (-38 vs. -40%). The action of trandolapril or candesartan cilexetil was greater than that of verapamil (p < 0.01). Reduction in the number of urinary podocytes from baseline was significantly greater in patients treated with trandolapril or candesartan cilexetil than in patients treated with verapamil (p < 0.01). However, there was no difference between patients treated with trandolapril and those treated with candesartan cilexetil. Proteinuria and urinary podocytes were unaffected in the placebo group. These data suggest that urinary podocytes may be a marker of disease activity in adult patients with IgA nephropathy and that trandolapril and candesartan cilexetil are more effective than verapamil in reducing the number of podocytes.",

    "446": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of pulsatile intravenous insulin therapy (PIVIT) on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). This 18-month multicenter, prospective, controlled study involved 49 type 1 DM patients with nephropathy who were following the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) intensive therapy (IT) regimen. Of these, 26 patients formed the control group (C), which continued on IT, while 23 patients formed the treatment group (T) and underwent, in addition to IT, weekly PIVIT. Blood pressure in all patients was maintained below 140/90 mm Hg on antihypertensive medication, preferentially using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. All study patients were seen in the clinic weekly for 18 months, had monthly glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), and every 3 months, 24-hour urinary protein excretion and creatinine clearance (CrCl) determinations. The HbA1c levels declined from 8.61% +/- 0.33% to 7.68% +/- 0.31% (P = .0028) in the T group and from 9.13% +/- 0.36% to 8.19% +/- 0.33% (P = .0015) in the C group during the study period. CrCl declined significantly in both groups, as expected, but the rate of CrCl decline in the T group (2.21 +/- 1.62 mL/min/yr) was significantly less than in the C group (7.69 +/- 1.88 mL/min/yr, P = .0343). We conclude that when PIVIT is added to IT in type 1 DM patients with overt nephropathy, it appears to markedly reduce the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The effect appears independent of ACE inhibitor therapy, blood pressure, or glycemic control.",

This study indicates that quinapril improved cardiopulmonary baroreflex and thus reduced sympathetic outflow in patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "448": "The present 2 multicenter studies were designed to evaluate whether patients with essential hypertension derived equal benefits from use of combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as from doubling the dose of the calcium antagonist. After a 2-week washout and a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a total of 1,390 patients were treated with either nifedipine 30 mg (study 1) or amlodipine 5 mg (study 2) once daily for 4 weeks. The 1,079 patients whose diastolic blood pressure remained between 95 and 115 mm Hg were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind therapy with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/ benazepril 20 mg, nifedipine 30 mg or nifedipine 60 mg (study 1), and amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg or amlodipine 10 mg (study 2). Both doses of the calcium antagonist/ACE inhibitor combination therapy lowered diastolic pressure as much as the high dose and significantly better than the lower dose of calcium antagonist monotherapy (with either nifedipine or amlodipine). However, 15% of patients in the nifedipine high-dose monotherapy group and 24% in the amlodipine high-dose monotherapy group presented with some form of edema. In contrast, the incidence of edema was similar for patients treated with both combination therapy and low-dose calcium antagonists. Thus, combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor provides blood pressure control equal to that of high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy but with significantly fewer dose-dependent adverse experiences such as vasodilatory edema.

    "450": "1. The tachykinin receptor present in the guinea-pig oesophageal mucosa that mediates contractile responses of the muscularis mucosae has been characterized, using functional in vitro experiments. 2. The NK(1) receptor-selective agonist, [Sar(9)(O(2))Met(11)]SP and the NK(3) receptor-selective agonists, [MePhe(7)]-NKB and senktide, produced no response at submicromolar concentrations. The NK(2) receptor-selective agonists, [Nle(10)]-NKA(4 - 10), and GR 64,349 produced concentration-dependent contractile effects with pD(2) values of 8.20+/-0.16 and 8.30+/-0.15, respectively. 3. The concentration-response curve to the non-selective agonist, NKA (pD(2)=8.13+/-0.04) was shifted significantly rightwards only by the NK(2) receptor-selective antagonist, GR 159,897 and was unaffected by the NK(1) receptor-selective antagonist, SR 140,333 and the NK(3) receptor-selective antagonist, SB 222,200. 4. The NK(2) receptor-selective antagonist, GR 159,897, exhibited an apparent competitive antagonism against the NK(2) receptor-selective agonist, GR 64,349 (apparent pK(B) value=9.29+/-0.16) and against the non-selective agonist, NKA (apparent pK(B) value=8.71+/-0.19). 5.

Over 30 randomized, controlled trials have evaluated the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on morbidity and mortality in over 7,000 patients with heart failure. Cumulative evidence from these trials shows that these agents significantly reduce mortality and hospitalizations, slow disease progression, and improve exercise tolerance and New York Heart Association class. The Heart Failure Society of America guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors as standard therapy for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The angiotensin receptor blockers and spironolactone offer alternative and perhaps complimentary mechanisms by which the RAA system may be therapeutically manipulated. The role of these therapies in treating heart failure is discussed.", 
    "460": "The field of hypertension is entering an exciting new era in which new concepts in basic and clinical science are being rapidly translated into new recommendations for clinical practice. It is now readily apparent that an age-related increase in stiffness of the walls of the large arteries causes the predominant hemodynamic characteristic of hypertension in later life: increased systolic blood pressure. Systolic hypertension is now recognized to have greater prognostic significance than diastolic hypertension, and it is also known that the effective treatment of systolic hypertension confers a proportional benefit in risk reduction. A rapidly advancing knowledge of vascular biology has revealed that the renin-angiotensin system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of vascular hypertrophy and arterial stiffness. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to reduce arterial stiffness to a greater degree than diuretics or beta-blockers. The pharmacologic interruption of the renin-angiotensin system may therefore confer previously unrecognized benefits on age-related vascular damage, providing special benefits in systolic hypertension.", 
    "461": "The influence that ACE inhibition has had on the natural history of cardiovascular and renal disease is remarkable, exceeding the expectations of even the most optimistic adherents. With the development of AngII antagonists, the mechanism by which ACE inhibitors reduce tissue injury has become an important problem. If the ACE inhibitors had their useful action through non-angiotensin-dependent mechanisms such as reduced kinin degradation, then AngII antagonist will not prove as useful. Conversely, if the major influence of the ACE inhibitors reflected a reduction in AngII formation, then the AngII antagonists will show real promise not only in matching the influence of the ACE inhibitors, but perhaps exceeding their ability to influence natural history, because the AngII antagonists will block non-ACE pathway-dependent AngII generation.", 
    "462": "Chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to improve cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal function in heart failure. To determine whether similar effects could be produced by angiotensin II AT(1) receptor blockade, we administered the ACE inhibitor quinapril, angiotensin II AT(1) receptor blocker losartan, or both agents together, to rabbits with pacing-induced heart failure. Chronic rapid pacing produced left ventricular dilation and decline of fractional shortening, increased plasma norepinephrine (NE), and caused reductions of myocardial NE uptake activity, NE histofluorescence profile, and tyrosine hydroxylase immunostained profile. Administration of quinapril or losartan retarded the progression of left ventricular dysfunction and attenuated cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal abnormalities in heart failure. Quinapril and losartan together produced greater effects than either agent alone. The effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibition on improvement of left ventricular function and remodeling, however, was not sustained. Our results suggest that the effects of ACE inhibitors are mediated via the reduction of angiotensin II and that angiotensin II plays a pivotal role in modulating cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal function during development of heart failure. The combined effect of ACE inhibition and angiotensin II AT(1) receptor blockade on cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal dysfunction may contribute to the beneficial effects on cardiac function in heart failure.", 
    "463": "The development of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and selective angiotensin type 1 (AT1)-receptor antagonists has provided new insights into understanding the mechanism of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. There is good evidence from meta-analyses that shows that inhibition of the RAS achieves organ protection features that go beyond blood pressure control. Candesartan cilexetil, a new angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is characterised by its tight binding to and slow dissociation from the AT1 receptor, and high antagonistic potency, resulting in long-lasting antagonistic effects. It is anticipated that these pharmacological characteristics may bring additional benefits to patients, not only for the management of essential hypertension but also for the management of end-organ damage.", 
    "464": "Complications of pregnancy have been found to be related with thrombophilic polymorphisms that explain about 30% of obstetric complications. We evaluated the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as possible risk factors for fetal loss. Fifty-nine women with a history of three or more first-trimester fetal losses and 70 healthy women with a history of normal pregnancies were enrolled in this study. Thrombophilic factors, ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) and AT1R A1166C polymorphisms, prothrombin G20210A and factor V Leiden mutations were analyzed. At univariate and multivariate analysis, a significant association between ACE DD and AT1R CC genotype and fetal loss was observed. The effect of the ACE DD genotype on the risk of fetal loss was higher in AT1R C allele carriers. The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (Hcy) (defined as baseline plasma levels higher than the 95% percentile; cut-off, 10.5 micromol/l per l) was significantly higher in women with fetal loss, and an association between Hcy and fetal loss was detected. All patients showed normal antithrombin, protein C, protein S, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) values. The presence of one risk factor not associated with others was found in 33 out of 59 patients (56%); ACE DD genotype was the most prevalent risk factor. Our results identify new possible predictive markers for fetal loss in RAS polymorphisms and Hcy. Large-scale studies are warranted to attribute clinical relevance to these polymorphisms as risk factors for complicated pregnancies.",

Therefore, the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors on haemostasis is of interest. The therapeutic dose of perindopril was previously shown to reduce platelet aggregation. In the present study, selected parameters of haemostasis were investigated in 23 patients with first and second stage of non-treated essential hypertension. The measurements were carried out before therapy, after 1 week of placebo administration, and after 1 week and after 1 month of ACE-inhibitor perindopril therapy in a once-daily dose of 4 mg. Plasma prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, plasminogen and antithrombin III activities, protein C and free protein S antigens, total fibrinolytic activity as well as fibrin monomers and D-dimers were assayed. There were no significant changes in any haemostasis variables investigated following placebo administration or perindopril therapy. On the basis of this study, no unfavourable effects on haemostasis induced by this therapy were found. The platelet-inhibitory effect of perindopril, without any harmful effects on coagulation or fibrinolytic activity and coagulation inhibitors, is desirable in the new approach to hypertension treatment. These properties of perindopril may be important in terms of the beneficial role of anti-hypertensive drugs in cardiovascular morbidity.", 
    "466": "The purpose of this investigation was to assess the pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration) and pharmacodynamics (heart rate, blood pressure (BP), and plasma renin activity (PRA)) of captopril experimental gel in normotensive rabbits and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) by reference to a short duration intravenous administration of the drug. In normotensive rabbits, the blood concentration versus time course of captopril after transdermal administration could be described well by a two-compartment model, and the maximum plasma concentration (5. 68+/-2.05 microg ml(-1)) was achieved in about 7 h. The increase in plasma captopril concentration led to increases in PRA and reductions in BP. A simple E(max) model adequately described the relationship between the percentage change of mean blood pressure (MBP) and the blood concentration of the captopril. The maximum reduction in MBP (E(max)) was 36.23% and the concentration at half maximum effect (EC(50)) was 0.24 microg ml(-1). The captopril was continuously released from the gel formulation and protected the SHRs in lower BP throughout the period of transdermal therapy. These results indicated that the development of captopril transdermal drug delivery system was possible. Further research was warranted on a modified formulation of captopril, which was optimized for transdermal delivery of the drug.",

ET receptor A (ET(A)) was markedly upregulated in failing human myocardium. This increased ET(A) expression was not affected by ACE inhibitor treatment but was normalized by VAD unloading. ET(A) expression before or after VAD implantation did not correlate with duration of VAD implantation or suppression of Pro-ANP mRNA. ET(B) mRNA expression was unaffected by heart failure or VAD. In contrast, increased ET-converting enzyme-1 mRNA and ET-1 peptide levels in failing myocardium were partially normalized by ACE inhibition but not by VAD unloading.",

    "479": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), an effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, has been reported to stimulate growth of blood vessels in vivo and smooth muscle cells in culture. In this study, the effect of Ang II on DNA synthesis was examined in deendothelialized human saphenous vein in organ culture. After 7 days' exposure to medium containing 0.4% fetal calf serum plus Ang II, there was a marked increase in DNA synthesis. The effect of Ang II was comparable to the response to platelet-derived growth factor. Responses to Ang II were partially inhibited by the AT(1) receptor antagonist candesartan. An AT(2) receptor antagonist, PD123319, had no effect on Ang II-induced DNA synthesis, either alone or in combination with candesartan. The Ang II peptide analogues [Sar(1), Ile(8)]-Ang II (saralasin) and [Sar(1),Thr(8)]-Ang II (sarthran) acted as agonists, increasing DNA synthesis. In the presence of saralasin, responses to Ang II were inhibited. Tyrphostin-23, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, prevented Ang II-induced DNA synthesis and reduced DNA synthesis in tissues incubated in medium containing only 0.4% fetal calf serum. In conclusion, Ang II stimulates DNA synthesis in human saphenous vein in organ culture. The effect of Ang II was more marked than has been previously reported in isolated cultured saphenous vein smooth muscle cells, and this effect is mediated in part by an angiotensin type 1 receptor. It is possible that an undefined receptor for Ang II may also be involved in the stimulation of DNA synthesis in this preparation.", 
    "480": "Acute inhibition of angiotensin II formation by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-I) attenuates tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) responsiveness. This has been proposed to facilitate sodium excretion, which contributes to the antihypertensive effects of ACE-I. However, in previous experiments in spontaneously hypertensive Fawn-hooded rats, TGF responses were normal during chronic ACE-I treatment. In the present study, we investigated TGF responsiveness during chronic ACE-I treatment in normotensive rats and the involvement of changes in nitric oxide or angiotensin II activity. Maximum TGF responses were assessed in control Sprague-Dawley rats and in rats acutely (acute ACE-I, 3 microgram/min IV) and chronically (chronic ACE-I, 100 mg/L PO 2 to 3 weeks+acute 3 microgram/min enalaprilat IV) treated with ACE-I. In all groups, TGF responses were also assessed during late proximal tubular perfusion with 1 mmol/L nitro-L-arginine. In a last group, the chronic ACE-I treatment was combined with acute ACE-I and high doses of intrarenal losartan (acute 3 microgram/min enalaprilat IV+50 mg/kg losartan). The maximum TGF responses in acutely treated ACE-I rats were strongly attenuated (0.7+/-0.4 mm Hg versus 6.5+/-0.8 mm Hg in control rats, P<0.05). Mean arterial pressure was lower in the chronically treated ACE-I group (107+/-5 mm Hg versus 126+/-5 mm Hg in control rats, P<0.05); however, TGF responses were normal (6. 4+/-0.9 mm Hg). Intraluminal nitro-L-arginine infusion did not influence TGF responses during acute ACE-I (2.3+/-0.4 mm Hg) but enhanced TGF responses during chronic ACE-I to the same extent as in control rats (14.5+/-2.3 versus 16.7+/-1.9 mm Hg, NS). In the rats chronically treated with ACE-I with superimposed acute infusion of losartan or chronically treated with losartan, TGF responses were significantly attenuated (1.8+/-0.8 mm Hg and 2.6+/-0.8 mm Hg, respectively; P:<0.05 versus chronic ACE-I and control). Prolonged administration with ACE-I is associated with normal TGF responses. This phenomenon appears to be mediated by AT1 receptors, because acute treatment with losartan in rats chronically treated with ACE-I and chronic treatment with losartan lead to strong attenuation of TGF responses.", 
    "481": "Little is known about the patterns of treatment and adequacy of blood pressure control in older women. The Women's Health Initiative, a 40-center national study of risk factors and prevention of heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, provides a unique opportunity to examine these issues in the largest, multiethnic, best-characterized such cohort. Baseline data from the initial 98 705 women, aged 50 to 79 years, enrolled were analyzed to relate prevalence, treatment, and control of hypertension to demographic, clinical, and risk-factor covariates, and logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Overall, 37.8% of the women had hypertension, which is defined as systolic blood pressure >/=140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure >/=90 mm Hg or being on medication for high blood pressure; 64.3% were treated with drugs, and blood pressure was controlled in only 36.1% of the hypertensive women, with lower rates of control in the oldest group. After adjustment for multiple covariates, current hormone users had higher prevalence than did nonusers (odds ratio 1.25). Hypertensive women had more comorbid conditions than did nonhypertensive women, and women with comorbidities were more likely to be treated pharmacologically. Diuretics were used by 44.3% of hypertensives either as monotherapy or in combination with other drug classes. As monotherapy, calcium channel blockers were used in 16%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 14%, beta-blockers in 9%, and diuretics in 14% of the hypertensive women. Diuretics as monotherapy were associated with better blood pressure control than any of the other drug classes as monotherapy. In conclusion, hypertension in older women is not being treated aggressively enough because a large proportion, especially those most at risk for stroke and heart disease by virtue of age, does not have sufficient blood pressure control.", 
    "482": "Despite normal indices of left ventricular (LV) chamber function, patients with LV hypertrophy (LVH) due to hypertension are thought to have depressed midwall systolic shortening compared with normotensives. The aims of the present study were (1) to confirm this observation and (2) to assess the effects of antihypertensive therapy that cause regression of LVH on LV systolic function assessed at both the midwall and endocardium. Thirty-eight previously untreated hypertensive subjects with LVH underwent echocardiography and were compared with 38 normotensive control subjects. Comparisons between the group with LVH and the control group revealed no significant differences in cardiac output (4. 32+/-0.23 versus 4.55+/-0.21 L/min), ejection fraction (62.5+/-2% versus 66.4+/-1.07%), or endocardial fractional shortening (34.5+/-1.45% versus 37.0+/-0.82%), but shortening assessed at the midwall was significantly less in the group with LVH (17.9+/-1.11% versus 21.6+/-0.63%, P<0.01). Subsequently, 32 patients with uncontrolled hypertension (24 previously untreated and 8 on existing antihypertensive therapy) underwent treatment with ramipril, with the addition of felodipine and bendrofluazide if required, to reduce blood pressure to <140/90 mm Hg. These 32 patients underwent echocardiography at baseline, after blood pressure control, and after an additional 6 months of tight blood pressure control. Good blood pressure control was achieved after 6 months compared with baseline (143/86+/-2.8/1.4 versus 174/103+/-4.1/1.9 mm Hg; P<0.01) with significant regression of LV mass index (124+/-3.4 versus 145+/-3.8 g/m(2), P<0.01). LV fractional shortening assessed at the midwall improved with regression of LVH (21.9+/-0.84 and 18.7+/-1. 19%, P<0.05), with posttreatment midwall shortening being similar to that of the normal control subjects evaluated in the first study. Hypertensive patients with LVH have depressed midwall systolic shortening despite normal indices of LV chamber function. Regression of LVH after good blood pressure control improved midwall shortening to normal levels.",

Such features could establish increased circulating amylin as a hereditary 'intermediate phenotype' useful in genetic analyses of hypertension.",

Differences in means were tested by ANOVA, variances by F test, and frequency distributions by maximum likelihood analysis. Co-release of amylin and insulin was provoked by intravenous infusion of mixed amino acids. The effect of antihypertensive treatment was evaluated after monotherapy with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or calcium-channel blockade in hypertension.", 
    "491": "Plasma amylin was increased in hypertension (P= 0.027), and body mass index was a strong predictor of increased circulating amylin (P = 0.0001). Plasma amylin and plasma renin activity were not correlated (P = 0.395), and effective antihypertensive monotherapy with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or calcium-channel blockade did not affect either amylin (P = 0.87-0.97) or insulin (P= 0.55-0.59). Among normotensive individuals, those at genetic risk of hypertension (with positive family history) already had increased concentrations of amylin (P< 0.001), despite exhibiting no difference in blood pressure or body mass index compared with the family-history-negative group; however, among normotensive individuals, both family history (P = 0.043) and body mass index (P= 0.0059) were significant predictors of increased concentrations of amylin. By maximum likelihood analysis, plasma amylin was distributed heterogeneously in the normotensive individuals, with two modes best explaining the distribution (chi2 = 77.4, P< 0.001), and family-history-positive individuals completely accounting for the upper mode (chi2 = 4.63, P = 0.031).

For the last 2 weeks of a 6-week period of either diet, the rats were treated with a vehicle (control or FFR); temocapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI); or CS-866, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB). The euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique was performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity (M value). TNF-alpha levels in soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles and epididymal fat pads were measured. We also measured the TNF-alpha concentration in an incubated medium secreted from soleus muscle strips with or without angiotensin II.",

Temocapril and CS-866 lowered systolic blood pressure, improved insulin resistance, and reduced TNF-alpha in both skeletal muscles. There were significant negative correlations between M values and TNF-alpha levels in both soleus and EDL muscles. Also, the soleus muscle strip incubation with 10(-7) mol/l angiotensin II increased TNF-alpha secreted into the incubation medium compared to the incubation without angiotensin II. These results suggest that skeletal muscle TNF-alpha is linked to insulin resistance and hypertension and that angiotensin II may be one of the factors that regulate skeletal muscle TNF-alpha.", 
    "496": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system actively participates in the derangement of renal function since the early stages of heart failure (HF). A diminished capacity to excrete sodium secondary to increased proximal tubular re-absorption and loss of the renal functional reserve are the two most relevant initial alterations of renal function in which angiotensin II has been proven to act directly. Meanwhile, the octapeptide contributes to maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within normal limits through efferent arteriole vasoconstriction. Administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARA) may thus be accompanied by a functional fall in that parameter. Advanced age, higher initial serum creatinine, history of hypertension, diabetes and atrial fibrillation predict the onset of GFR impairment associated with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Concomitant administration of betablockers may help to protect renal function, and preliminary data indicate that the combination of ACEi and ARA is not accompanied by a higher renal risk. The good prognostic effects of aldosterone antagonists in HF does not seem to be related to intrarenal effects of these compounds with the exception of preventing potassium loss and hypokalemia. The systematic therapeutic use of drug(s) provided with beneficial renal effects, to treat arterial hypertension or myocardial ischemia, may contribute to delay of, or prevent the development of HF.",

In both groups pts with inferior AMI (accordingly 66% and 72%) and normal LV function (EF > or = 40% in ECHO) were prevailed in the study. Captopril therapy was initiated with the dose of 3.125 mg, then every 8 hours the dose of 6.25 mg was administered in Ist and IInd day, 12.5 mg--in III day and 25 mg from IV day on. Exercise cycle ergometer tests (ExT) were performed in every pt at 14 day, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after AMI. The ExT began at 25 W of power and was increased at 2-minute intervals by 25 W until fatigue or other typical cause of termination of the test. In the captopril group duration of ExT lengthened significantly in comparison with initial test (on 14 day) after 3 (6.4 +/- 1.47 vs 5.3 +/- 1.54 min; p < 0.01), 6 (6.7 +/- 1.59 vs 5.3 +/- 1.54 min; p < 0.001) and 12 months (7.0 +/- 1.22 vs 5.3 +/- 1.54 min; p < 0.001).

However, the differences regarding this time between the captopril and control group were not significant on consecutive control stages. The final result of the test (positive, negative, doubtful) did not differ significantly in both groups on consecutive examination stages. Captopril administered during 1-year period after AMI slightly improved physical working capacity (accelerated the improvement) and had no effect on ischemia during estimated cycle ergometer test.

    "498": "In the elderly, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of long-term effective blood pressure control with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor temocapril on left ventricular (LV) mass and function indices and the circulating concentration of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in elderly hypertensives with LVH. Temocapril treatment was administered for 1 year to 11 elderly hypertensives (mean age, 72 years) with LVH. Cardiac dimensions and circulating concentrations of BNP were monitored before initiation of treatment and after 1 year of treatment. At entry, BNP levels were positively correlated with the LV mass index, but were not correlated with the mean blood pressure, LV ejection fraction, or E/A ratio (the ratio of peak transmitral flow velocity in early diastole, peak E, to that in late diastole, peak A). After 1 year, temocapril treatment resulted in effective control of blood pressure. The treatment did not affect the LV ejection fraction, but modestly increased the E/A ratio. Temocapril significantly reduced septal and posterior wall thickness and the LV mass index. BNP significantly declined after 1 year. Changes in BNP were significantly related to changes in the LV mass index, but were not related to changes in the mean blood pressure, LV ejection fraction, or E/A ratio. The results suggest that long-term ACE inhibitor treatment with temocapril can induce the regression of LV mass and reduce elevated plasma BNP in elderly hypertensive patients with LVH. In this study, changes in BNP reflected the magnitude of regression of LVH.",

Although a variety of aetiological factors have been listed, most patients with echocardiographically documented DCM do not possess a demonstrable cause. Poor myocardial function in DCM triggers a sequence of compensatory mechanisms, mediated through the renin angiotensin system, the sympathetic system (neural and humoral) and a number of vasodilatory molecules. These favour myocardial and peripheral vascular remodelling by necrosis, fibrosis and apoptosis which ultimately does more harm than good. Management is essentially similar to that of CCF using a combination of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and digoxin. Use of additional diuretics, intravenous frusemide, dobutamine infusion and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers help to improve quality of life in resistant patients. ACEI, beta-adrenergic blockers and possibly aldosterone antagonists prolong survival. Compliance to medication can be enhanced by improving drug formulations and by assisting the family to choose the 'best-fit' regimen (concordance). At present, optimum management of end-stage CCF is cardiac transplant.",

At 30 and 120 min after treatment with vehicle, big endothelin-1 (big ET-1, 0.3 nmol/kg i.v.) produced increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 982 +/- 31 and 992 +/- 43 mmHg x min (area under the curve), respectively. Doses of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg i.v., of CGS 35066 blocked these pressor responses by 61 +/- 7, 78 +/- 4, 93 +/- 4 and 98 +/- 2% at 30 min (p < 0.05 compared with vehicle controls, all doses), and by 29 +/- 7, 63 +/- 5, 63 +/- 5 and 84 +/- 10% at 120 min (p < 0.05, all doses). In contrast, the pressor effect (58 +/- 6 mmHg) of angiotensin-I (300 ng/kg i.v.) was unaffected by the ECE-1 inhibitor (10 mg/kg i.v.) indicating the absence of activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme. In rats infused with atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), CGS 35066, at 1 mg/kg, had no effect on plasma irANP; however, irANP levels were doubled at a dose of 30 mg/kg. These results demonstrate that CGS 35066 is the most potent and selective ECE inhibitor identified to date.",

    "512": "Renovascular disease due to progressive atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in the elderly. At what degree of renal artery stenosis should intervention be recommended is not clear. To answer this question, unilateral or bilateral activation of the renin-angiotensin system or its absence were detected by captopril-stimulated renal vein renin measurements in 49 hypertensive patients, aged 63 years, with normal or near-normal renal function (serum creatinine concentration < or =2.0 mg/dL), and the information was matched against radiographic measurements of the extent of renal artery stenosis. With few exceptions, unilateral or bilateral hypersecretion of renin was associated with 80% or greater reduction of renal artery lumen diameter. In contrast, normal secretion or suppression of renin production in a kidney contralateral to an ischemic one was associated with either normal caliber renal artery or renal artery stenosis less than 80%. These findings suggest that renal artery stenosis less than 80% should be monitored rather than treated because improvement of renal function and amelioration of hypertension are not expected unless the renin-angiotensin system has been activated in the affected kidney. Renoprotection by early intervention is uncertain because progression of renal artery stenosis is unpredictable. Normal captopril-stimulated renal vein renin measurements in hypertensive patients obviate the need for further work-up or interventional therapy of renovascular disease.", 
    "513": "This large multicenter study, tested the antihypertensive effects of isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients under low and high salt intake diets. After a 3-week (weeks -9 to -6) of ad lib salt diet, those patients who had a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of > or =95 but < or =115 mm Hg qualified to enter a 3-week (weeks -6 to -3) placebo run-in low salt diet (50 to 80 mmol Na+/day). Then high salt (200 to 250 mmol Na+/day) was added to the placebo treatment for 3 weeks (weeks -3 to 0). Those patients who demonstrated an increase in SDBP > or =5 mm Hg from the low to high salt diet were considered salt sensitive and were randomized into a 4-week (weeks 0 to 4) double-blind treatment period of either isradipine 2.5 to 10 mg twice a day, enalapril 2.5 to 20 mg twice a day, or placebo. Then they entered a 3-week (weeks 4 to 7) placebo washout phase of low salt diet (50 to 80 mmol Na+/day). After week 7 and while the low salt diet was continued the patients were restarted on their double-blind treatment for 4 more weeks (weeks 7 to 11) and the study was completed. Of 1,916 patients screened, 464 were randomized into the double-blind treatment phase and 397 completed the study. Both isradipine and enalapril decreased the sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) and SDBP during the high salt diet, to a similar degree, whereas enalapril caused a greater reduction in SSBP and SDBP than isradipine during the low salt diet (11.3 +/- 1.2/7.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg v 7.7 +/- 0.9/4.8 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM, respectively, P < .02). Within drugs, the effect of isradipine on blood pressure (BP) was higher during the high than the low salt diet (14.9 +/- 1.5 v 7.6 +/- 1.3 mm Hg for SSBP and 10.1 +/- 0.6 v 4.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg for SDBP, P < .001), but enalapril exerted a similar effect during both diets. Because salt restriction lowered both SSBP and SDBP, the lowest BP achieved with both drugs were during the salt restriction phase.", 
    "514": "Arthritis and hypertension are frequent comorbidities in the elderly hypertensive population. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to relieve pain in arthritic patients but a side effect is sodium retention and consequent elevation of blood pressure (BP). The effect of dihydropyridine calcium blocking drugs is relatively independent of sodium intake, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors' effects can be blunted by a high-sodium diet. This study compared the effects of indomethacin with placebo in elderly patients with essential hypertension who had been controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. Indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or placebo was administered for 3 weeks in a double-blind crossover study to patients controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. The response was assessed by ambulatory BP measurement. Indomethacin raised BP and lowered pulse rates in patients taking enalapril but had little effect in patients receiving amlodipine. The difference caused by indomethacin between the two groups was 10.1/4.9 mm Hg increase in BP and a 5.6 beats/min fall in pulse in people taking enalapril. Addition of indomethacin to patients taking either drug caused a rise in weight and a fall in plasma renin. It is postulated that the effect is due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which causes sodium retention. In patients taking amlodipine, the fall in plasma renin ameliorates the effect of sodium retention on BP. In patients taking enalapril, plasma renin falls but this is not translated into an effect because of the blockage of converting enzyme. Thus, the full effect of sodium retention on BP is expressed. In patients treated with indomethacin, fewer patients may respond to ACE inhibitors. However, the major problem is the patient who intermittently takes indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which, if a person is treated by an ACE inhibitor causes BP to go out of control. In such patients amlodipine would appear to be a preferred choice to enalapril.",

After 3 months, patients were retrospectively stratified into those receiving beta-blockers plus ACE-I (Group A, n = 126), ACE-I (Group B, n = 135), and ACE-I plus intravenous support (Group C, n = 57). Endpoint 1 of the study was combined urgent heart transplantation, mechanical assist device implantation, and pretransplant death during a follow-up of 12 to 48 (mean 19 +/- 11) months.

While between Groups A and C all event rates of Endpoint 1 differed significantly, between Group C and Group B total mortality (30% vs 27%) was similar. However, in Group C urgent heart transplantation (HTx) was more often performed than in Group B (54% vs 11%, p < 0.0001). Seventy of 318 patients (22%) underwent heart transplantation (16% urgent, 6% elective).

    "536": "Coronary artery disease is still the no. 1 killer in the developed countries and must thus be detected and treated at an earlier stage. If coronary artery disease is advanced, patients have to be examined regarding the need for revascularization. For secondary prevention, of course, an optimal change of life style and optimal medical treatment of risk factors is mandatory. Independent of the optimal risk factor modification, all of these patients (according to the rules of evidence-based medicine) should take ASA, statins, beta blockers and ACE-inhibitors, if no contraindications or intolerance are present. Therefore, the problem in secondary prevention is not how to identify these patients, but rather how to fulfill their needs. In our own survey in patients with known coronary artery disease referred for PTCA (including patients with post myocardial infarction previous PTCA or bypass surgery), only 89% were on ASA (or clopidogrel), 51% on lipid lowering drugs (46% on statins), 65% on beta blockers, and only 43% had an ACE-inhibitor (MUNICH data in Figures 1 to 4). The analysis of published literature is also depicted in Figures 1 to 4. Until 1996, patients with known coronary artery disease took ASA in only 26% of the cases but later on it was 77 to 100% (Figure 1). Lipid lowering drugs (especially statins) are prescribed in only 13 to 77% (Figure 2), beta blockers in only 30 to 80% (Figure 3) and ACE-inhibitors in only 10 to 72% (Figure 4). In 2 major studies, a decrease in the rate of intake of these drugs during the follow-up years has been documented. The \"ideal tablet\" for secondary prevention contains ASA (100 mg), a statin (e.g. for most statins 40 to 80 mg), a beta blocker (e.g. metoprolol 100 mg or bisoprolol 10 mg) and an ACE-inhibitor (e.g. ramipril 10 mg). So this ideal \"SPM\" (\"secondary prevention mix\") tablet contains 160 to 300 mg of drugs. In conclusion, the analysis of published data for Europe and the USA shows that--in contrast to the statements of politicians and health care insurance companies--we are not overtreating but rather undertreating our patients regarding medications for secondary prevention.",

Duration of follow-up varied among clinics with the longest mean follow-up at PRMC (10.8 yrs) compared to 6.1 years and 4.7 years at the PUBMC and SPMC respectively. Mean age was greatest at the PUBMC (60 yrs) compared to 53 years in the SPMC and 50 years in the PRMC (p < 0.001). Sex distribution differed among clinics with 15% men in the PUBMC, 34% in the SPMC and 54% in the PRMC (p < 0.001). Over 92% of patients had blood pressure (BP) recorded at least once in the 12-month review period. Hypertension was defined as being prescribed antihypertensive medication in clinic records. By this definition 98% SPMC patients were hypertensive, compared to 87% PUBMC and 80% PRMC. Using BP < 160/95 mmHg, the PRMC control rate, 63% was significantly better than those of PUBMC (46%) and SPMC (49%) (p < 0.01). The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for poor control (BP > 160/95 mmHg) at the PRMC was 0.57 (0.34-0.97) compared to the other two clinics after adjustments for age, clinic type, duration of follow-up and gender. Only age was a significant covariate with older patients at greater risk of poor control. Only 18% of hypertensives were controlled to BP < 140/90 mmHg with no difference among clinics. Diuretics were the commonest agent used at the PUBMC (76%) and SPMC (86%) followed by alpha-methyldopa, 41% and 27%, respectively. These agents were less commonly prescribed at the PRMC than at the other clinics (45% diuretics and 8% alpha-methyldopa, p < 0.001 for both agents compared to other clinics). PRMC used more angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 38%, compared to SPMC 23% and PUBMC 1% (p < 0.001). Between 9% and 15% of patients at the PUBMC and PRMC had recorded data on smoking and alcohol use compared to 69% at the SPMC. A record of body weight was found in 99% at SPMC compared to 82% at PRMC and 33% at PUBMC (p < 0.001). Surveillance for complications differed for proteinuria (PRMC 33%, PUBMC 15%, SPMC 15%) and fundoscopy (PUBMC 0%, PRMC 3%, SPMC 43%).

    "538": "The major cause of morbidity and mortality associated with coronary atherosclerosis is plaque rupture, which often results in one of the acute coronary syndromes: unstable angina, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI), or Q-wave MI. Plaque rupture may be attributable to the thickness of the overlying fibrous cap; thinner plaques are more likely to rupture. It appears that the presence of inflammation is a significant contributor to rupture. Acute-phase treatments are highly efficacious, but secondary prevention, often overlooked, also is life-saving. Diet, exercise, and medications are the interventions available for secondary prevention. Four classes of medications--aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins)--are also used in this setting with a high degree of success in reducing mortality and morbidity. Numerous studies have demonstrated a 30-50% reduction in mortality with aspirin. The reduction in mortality achieved with beta blockers in studies of patients after myocardial infarction are 15-50%. ACE inhibitors significantly reduce the risk of death from myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease with or without myocardial infarction. Statins are beneficial even in patients whose cholesterol level is low to normal. Patients who were discharged on a statin showed a 50% reduction in mortality over those who did not receive statin therapy independent of lipid level. C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, is predictive of mortality, as are age and ejection fraction. Statins may be anti-inflammatory in addition to their lipid-lowering effect. Secondary-prevention strategies such as case management, electronic discharge prompting, better communication between referring physicians and cardiologists, and patient education may also have positive effects on after-discharge morbidity and mortality.",

In some cases, there is resistance among clinicians to change aspects of care--particularly prescribing habits. We sought to improve the use of aspirin and beta-blocker therapy for patients diagnosed with AMI and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for patients with congestive heart failure.

    "545": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme that plays a major role in vasoactive peptide metabolism, is a type 1 ectoprotein, which is released from the plasma membrane by a proteolytic cleavage occurring in the stalk sequence adjacent to the membrane anchor. In this study, we have discovered the molecular mechanism underlying the marked increase of plasma ACE levels observed in three unrelated individuals. We have identified a Pro(1199) --> Leu mutation in the juxtamembrane stalk region. In vitro analysis revealed that the shedding of [Leu(1199)]ACE was enhanced compared with wild-type ACE. The solubilization process of [Leu(1199)]ACE was stimulated by phorbol esters and inhibited by compound 3, an inhibitor of ACE-secretase. The results of Western blot analysis were consistent with a cleavage at the major described site (Arg(1203)/Ser(1204)). Two-dimensional structural analysis of ACE showed that the mutated residue was critical for the positioning of a specific loop containing the cleavage site. We therefore propose that a local conformational modification caused by the Pro(1199) --> Leu mutation leads to more accessibility at the stalk region for ACE secretase and is responsible for the enhancement of the cleavage-secretion process. Our results show that different molecular mechanisms are responsible for the common genetic variation of plasma ACE and for its more rare familial elevation.",

These occurrences represented one third of all-cause severe hyperkalemia cases admitted during this one-year period. A common observation in our cases was that the dose of spironolactone employed far exceeded the recommended dosages. These cases illustrate that spironolactone dosage must be kept low in the setting of chronic congestive heart failure treatment, as well as the need for close monitoring of frail elderly patients who are given this combination.",

These high-risk patients included those with hypotension, hyponatraemia, compromised renal function, the elderly and patients with diabetes mellitus at baseline. In the whole study population, high-dose lisinopril led to a trend in risk reduction of all-cause mortality (primary end-point P=0.128) and a significant risk reduction in all-cause mortality plus hospitalization (principal secondary end-point P=0.002). Subgroup analyses were performed for these end-points. There were no consistent interactions between age, baseline sodium, creatinine or potassium values, and treatment effect. Diabetics showed a beneficial response to high-dose therapy that was at least as good as that in non-diabetics. The underlying higher morbidity/mortality rates in diabetics mean that high-dose lisinopril has potential for a larger absolute clinical impact in these patients.",

    "570": "Left ventricular remodeling is a frequent and unfavorable evolution of both ischemic and non-ischemic dilative cardiomyopathy with a significant reduction in left ventricular systolic and diastolic performance. By the term \"remodeling\" we refer to a variety of alterations in left ventricular morphology and volume; while patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy frequently show global and quite homogeneous enlargement of the left ventricle, transmural myocardial infarctions can be followed initially by regional expansion and only in a second stage by a global increase in ventricular size. Cardiologists have a number of therapeutic options from which to choose: ACE-inhibitors and probably angiotensin II antagonists can contrast the unfavorable progression of the phenomenon, while beta-blockers such as metoprolol and carvedilol probably can reverse the process. In addition, moderate exercise training not only produces no detrimental effects on infarct size or left ventricular topography, but can prevent the progression of left ventricular dysfunction and its attendant morbidity and mortality in selected populations.", 
    "571": "Kinins in the circulation are rapidly metabolized by several different peptidases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of membrane-bound peptidases to kinin metabolism in the renal circulation. Experiments were performed in vitro, in isolated rat kidneys perfused at a constant flow rate (8 ml/min) with Tyrode's solution. The effects of peptidase inhibitors were evaluated on the functional vasodilator response caused by bradykinin (30 nM) or [Tyr(Me)(8)]bradykinin (10 nM) via activation of bradykinin B2 receptors in kidneys precontracted with prostaglandin F2alpha. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, enalaprilat (3 microM), ramiprilat (1 microM) or lisinopril (1 microM), increased the bradykinin-induced renal vasodilation by 40% or more. Inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (thiorphan or phosphoramidon, 10 microM), basic carboxypeptidase (DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid or MGTPA, 10 microM) and aminopeptidase P (apstatin, 20 microM) however did not enhance the renal vasodilator response elicited by kinins, whatever tested alone or in the presence of lisinopril. These findings indicate that angiotensin converting enzyme is the major peptidase whose inhibition potentiates the renal bradykinin B2 receptor mediated vasodilator response of kinins. The relative contribution in this potentiation of inhibition of kinin inactivation and of cross-talk of angiotensin converting enzyme with bradykinin B2 receptor remains however to be clarified.", 
    "572": "The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi employs multiple molecular strategies to invade a broad range of nonphagocytic cells. Here we demonstrate that the invasion of human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing the B(2) type of bradykinin receptor (CHO-B(2)R) by tissue culture trypomastigotes is subtly modulated by the combined activities of kininogens, kininogenases, and kinin-degrading peptidases. The presence of captopril, an inhibitor of bradykinin degradation by kininase II, drastically potentiated parasitic invasion of HUVECs and CHO-B(2)R, but not of mock-transfected CHO cells, whereas the B(2)R antagonist HOE 140 or monoclonal antibody MBK3 to bradykinin blocked these effects. Invasion competence correlated with the parasites' ability to liberate the short-lived kinins from cell-bound kininogen and to elicit vigorous intracellular free calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients through B(2)R. Invasion was impaired by membrane-permeable cysteine proteinase inhibitors such as Z-(SBz)Cys-Phe-CHN(2) but not by the hydrophilic inhibitor 1-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucyl-amido-(4-guanidino) butane or cystatin C, suggesting that kinin release is confined to secluded spaces formed by juxtaposition of host cell and parasite plasma membranes. Analysis of trypomastigote transfectants expressing various cysteine proteinase isoforms showed that invasion competence is linked to the kinin releasing activity of cruzipain, herein proposed as a factor of virulence in Chagas' disease.",

The effects on natriuresis coincided with a significant reduction of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in rats on trandolapril and spironolactone (10.8+/-8.2 mm Hg; P:<0.05 versus CHF placebo: 23.3+/-7.2 mm Hg; sham-operated rats: 5.1+/-0.9 mm Hg), whereas LVEDP remained elevated in rats treated with either compound alone.",

    "576": "Angiotensin (Ang) I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a member of the gluzincin family of zinc metalloproteinases that contains two homologous catalytic domains. Both the N- and C-terminal domains are peptidyl-dipeptidases that catalyze Ang II formation and bradykinin degradation. Multiple sequence alignment was used to predict His(1089) as the catalytic residue in human ACE C-domain that, by analogy with the prototypical gluzincin, thermolysin, stabilizes the scissile carbonyl bond through a hydrogen bond during transition state binding. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change His(1089) to Ala or Leu. At pH 7.5, with Ang I as substrate, k(cat)/K(m) values for these Ala and Leu mutants were 430 and 4,000-fold lower, respectively, compared with wild-type enzyme and were mainly due to a decrease in catalytic rate (k(cat)) with minor effects on ground state substrate binding (K(m)). A 120,000-fold decrease in the binding of lisinopril, a proposed transition state mimic, was also observed with the His(1089) --> Ala mutation. ACE C-domain-dependent cleavage of AcAFAA showed a pH optimum of 8.2. H1089A has a pH optimum of 5.5 with no pH dependence of its catalytic activity in the range 6.5-10.5, indicating that the His(1089) side chain allows ACE to function as an alkaline peptidyl-dipeptidase. Since transition state mutants of other gluzincins show pH optima shifts toward the alkaline, this effect of His(1089) on the ACE pH optimum and its ability to influence transition state binding of the sulfhydryl inhibitor captopril indicate that the catalytic mechanism of ACE is distinct from that of other gluzincins.", 
    "577": "We tested the hypothesis that ischemia alters sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ transport by oxidizing regulatory thiols on ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and that membrane-permeable sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors protect against ischemia-induced oxidation and explain in part, the therapeutic actions of captopril. Ca2+ uptake and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity was measured from SR vesicles isolated from control or ischemic dog and human ventricles and compared with or without sulfhydryl reductants. The rate and amount of Ca2+ uptake was lower for canine ischemic SR compared with control (6.5 +/- 0.2 --> 18.5 +/- 1.1 nmol Ca2+/mg/min and 123.1 +/- 4.7 --> 235.0 +/- 17.3 nmol Ca2+/mg; n = 8 each). Captopril, dithiothreitol (DTT), glutathione (GSH), and L-cysteine increased the rate and amount of Ca2+ uptake by canine and human ischemic SR vesicles by approximately 50%. Reducing agents had no effect on Ca2+- ATPase activity in either canine control or ischemic (approximately 40% less than control) SR. Captopril was as potent as DTT at reversing the oxidation of skeletal and cardiac RyRs induced by reactive disulfides (RDSs) or nitric oxide (NO). In neonatal rat myocytes, RDSs or NO triggered SR Ca2+ release and increased cytosolic Ca2+, an effect reversed by captopril and DTT but not GSH or cysteine. Pretreatment of myocytes with captopril (exposure and then wash) inhibited Ca2+ elevation elicited by RDSs or NO, indicating that captopril is an effective, membrane-permeable intracellular reducing agent. Thus, net SR Ca2+ accumulation is reduced by ischemia in part due to the oxidation of thiols that gate RyRs, an effect reversed by captopril.", 
    "578": "Restoration of flow-dependent coronary artery dilation by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) has been demonstrated in patients with hypertension. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether dilation of conductance coronary arteries may alter maximal coronary blood flow (CBFmax) and minimal coronary resistance (CRmin) in hypertensive patients with reversible impairment of flow-dependent coronary artery dilation. Thirteen hypertensive patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and no other risk factors were studied. Cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of proximal and distal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary arteries were determined by quantitative angiography. Coronary flow velocity was recorded in the distal LAD with an intracoronary Doppler catheter. Estimates of coronary blood flow and resistance were calculated at rest and during maximal increase in blood flow induced by papaverine injected in the midportion of the LAD, both before and after ACEI. Flow-dependent dilation of the proximal LAD, abolished before ACEI, was restored after (26.7 +/- 11.2%; p < 0.001). The increase in CSA of the distal LAD exposed to papaverine was significantly higher after ACEI than before (from 33.4 +/- 20.5% to 51.5 +/- 23.4%; p < 0.001). After restoration of proximal LAD flow-dependent dilation, CBFmax was increased by +21.0 +/- 10.3% (p < 0.001), and CRmin was reduced by 19.3 +/- 9.5% (p < 0.001). Thus, dilation of epicardial coronary arteries participates substantially in the coronary resistance in hypertensive patients. Restoration of flow-dependent coronary artery dilation by ACEI may improve the ability of coronary circulation to deliver its maximal myocardial blood flow in hypertensive patients.", 
    "579": "Cocaine abuse and HIV disease each have potentially adverse effects upon the heart and cardiovascular system which may be exacerbated when these risk factors are combined. The development of a safe and effective agent to treat both cocaine addiction and its cardiovascular sequelae, that is well-tolerated by HIV patients, would thus be of considerable clinical utility. In this article we discuss the rationale for the investigation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, commonly used to treat hypertension, for treatment in cocaine-abusing populations, based on their potential to reduce cocaine use by modulating levels of dopamine and corticotropin releasing factor in the brain, and on their ability to reverse cardiovascular and platelet abnormalities. We present preliminary findings from echocardiographic and platelet activation studies in 16 HIV-positive, cocaine abusing patients, as well as tolerability and efficacy studies of the ACE-inhibitor, fosinopril, for the treatment of cocaine abuse in both HIV-positive (n=6) and HIV-negative (n=5) methadone-maintained cocaine abusers. Findings suggest that HIV-positive cocaine-abusing patients possess abnormalities of diastolic heart function and platelet activation that are potentially reversible with ACE-inhibitor therapy. Findings also suggest that fosinopril is well-tolerated regardless of HIV serostatus, does not appear to cause hypotension, and may possess effectiveness for reducing cocaine use. We conclude that ACE-inhibitor therapy may offer a new pharmacologic approach to the treatment of cocaine abuse and its complications, and that controlled research of this class of agents may be promising.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are efficacious in lowering the hematocrit of patients with PTE and angiotensin II (AII) type I receptors (AT1R) were recently detected on red blood cell precursors, burst-forming unit-erythroid- (BFU-E) derived cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is increased expression of the AT1R on BFU-E-derived cells of patients with PTE, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of PTE.", 
    "581": "Twelve healthy volunteers and 25 transplant recipients (13 patients with and 12 without PTE) were studied. BFU-E from peripheral blood were cultured in methylcellulose and BFU-E-derived colonies were harvested on day 10.

Intracellular free calcium in response to AII and erythropoietin (Epo) was measured with digital video imaging.",

Hematocrit, red blood cell number, BFU-E-derived colony number,and size were significantly increased in PTE compared with other two groups. AT1R expression was increased by 44% on the erythroid progenitors of PTE versus non posttransplant erythrocytosis patients and by 32% in PTE patients versus normal volunteers. AT1R expression correlated significantly with the hematocrit in PTE (Spearman r=0.68, P=0.01). In contrast, EpoR expression was equivalent in all groups. The AT1R was functional since a significant increase in [Ca(i)] was observed in Fura-2 loaded day 10 cells when stimulated with AII (182%, P<0.0001).", 
    "583": "An increase in AT1R density was observed in erythroid precursors of transplant patients with PTE compared to those without PTE and normal volunteers, and the level of AT1R expression in PTE correlated significantly with the hematocrit. In contrast, EpoR expression was not different in PTE compared with non posttransplant erythrocytosis or normal controls. This study supports a role for the AT1 receptor signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of PTE.", 
    "584": "Real-world adherence to pharmacotherapy cannot be studied in the confines of the traditional clinical trial. Thus, to better understand adherence to antihypertensive medication in actual practice, a literature search was conducted to identify observational database studies of the use of antihypertensive medication. Ten studies were identified: half studied adherence patterns after initial prescriptions to patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension, and the others evaluated antihypertensive medication use in a mix of patients with newly diagnosed or chronic hypertension. Overall, results demonstrated that adherence to treatment for hypertension in the first year is very poor. In addition, it appears that initial treatment with newer classes of drugs, such as angiotensin II antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers favors treatment adherence. This review also highlights and discusses possible under-lying factors contributing to these results and implications for physicians.",

    "596": "Arterial hypertension, including the elucidation of hypertension pathogenic mechanisms involving elements in the composition of the blood, continues to represent a topical research area. Recent work, such as nuclear magnetic resonance studies looking into red cell permeability, illustrates the presence of modifications of red cell permeability to water (RCPW) related to the stage of arterial hypertension. The identification of a significant increase of RCPW compared to that present in the population with normal arterial pressure values can be useful both in early diagnosis and in warning about a possible predisposition for this condition. At the same time, the dynamic investigation of protonic relaxation time of both intra- and extra-erythrocytic water, the assessment of proton exchange time across the red cell and the calculation of permeability to water enable one not only to diagnose arterial hypertension but also to ascertain the evolution of the disease, its complications and the effectiveness of anti-hypertensive medication. Our studies have also proven the existence of a correlation between the values of systolic arterial pressure and red cell permeability to water. The curve describing the interdependence of the two values has the shape of a bell, in the case of males. The peak of the curve is reached for a systolic pressure of 160 mmHg and gets below the values of the control group in the case of systolic pressures above 200 mmHg. The RCPW test can also be considered a valuable indicator in evaluating the risk of stroke in hypertensive patients. In the chronic therapy of arterial hypertension with various types of anti-hypertensive drugs, one can note differences in the RCPW values related to the effectiveness of the respective medication, to the clinical form and stage of the disease, the sex of the patient as well as to the existence of cerebro-vascular complications.", 
    "597": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a complex syndrome involving activation of multiple cellular, metabolic, and neurohumoral pathways following the initial myocardial insult. Recently, there have been considerable advances in the pharmacologic management of CHF. The current approach to treatment recognizes the need to target neurohormonal activation, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers should now be regarded as part of standard therapy in many patients with CHF. However, because of the complexity of the disease, blockade of additional pathways is likely to be required to maximize the therapeutic benefit of intervention. To this end, there are several agents under active late-phase clinical evaluation. The most advanced of these new strategies (beyond renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade) is inhibition of the endothelin system. There is a substantial body of evidence that this system is intimately involved in CHF disease progression. Early-phase clinical data are very encouraging and support the potential utility of long-term endothelin inhibition. Other novel approaches involve the use of cytokine antagonists (e.g., agents that block tumor necrosis factor-alpha activity) and the augmentation of natriuretic peptides. If all these potential agents prove to be of benefit in CHF, the question of which agent or combination of agents to use in which patients will arise. There is therefore a need to develop scientific approaches in order to be able to identify more accurately patients who will obtain benefit from specific classes or combinations of drugs.", 
    "598": "Diastolic dysfunction is the underlying problem in one third of patients with heart failure, but it is still not well understood. Carefully excluding other causes of heart failure and recognizing indicators of diastolic dysfunction on invasive and noninvasive tests are important in establishing the diagnosis and in guiding therapy. Left ventricular relaxation and stiffness and left atrial function are the most important factors acting together to maintain adequate cardiac output under normal filling pressure. Echocardiography is the most important tool for the diagnosis of diastolic heart dysfunction. It is portable, safe, and excludes other causes of heart failure, such as valvular disease. Diuretics can be used to reduce volume overload, but caution is advised, as aggressive diuresis decreases stroke volume more in diastolic dysfunction than in systolic dysfunction.", 
    "599": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with hypertension. If untreated, hypertension has a major impact on the clinical course of Type 2 diabetes and its vascular complications. In this review, we discuss rationale for the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) in hypertensive Type 2 diabetic patients and compare those theoretical assumptions with results of recent major clinical trials. Furthermore, possible directions for future clinical and experimental research are outlined. The RAS and its effector angiotensin II are important players in a number of cardiovascular and renal disorders. Recent evidence suggests that RAS and factors functionally linked to RAS are activated in Type 2 diabetes. Therefore, there is a theoretical basis for the use of ACEI in the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. Some recent studies reported superior outcome in patients treated with ACEI-based antihypertensive regimens compared with non-ACEI based treatments in reducing the risk of macrovascular disease (CAPPP, FACET, ABCD) or both micro- and macrovascular complications in Type 2 diabetes (HOPE). However, at least two of the large prospective studies discussed in this review (UKPDS 38, HOT), supported by results from previously published SHEP study, have recently suggested that the degree of reduction of blood pressure, rather than the choice of a particular class of antihypertensive agent, is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular events. Studies focusing on renal end-points suggest that ACEI have a superior antiproteinuric effect than the other agents. However, whether ACEI are more nephroprotective, as assessed by the rate of decline in renal function, still remains to be elucidated. Despite promising results from recent trials, large numbers of patients progress despite ACEI treatment. Incomplete inhibition of the RAS may underlie this phenomenon. Treatment strategies that could enhance the degree of RAS inhibition represent one possible direction for clinical research in the near future. However, it is unlikely that the course of such a complex syndrome as Type 2 diabetes could be dramatically changed by just one class of antihypertensive agents. This goal is more likely to be achieved by multifactorial intervention, reflecting the complexity of metabolic syndrome. ACEI should be viewed as an important, but not the only, part of this complex approach.", 
    "600": "The objective of this review is to discuss recent experimental and clinical data concerning the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs in preventing or delaying renal changes caused by diabetes mellitus and hypertension and to examine possible future developments. A brief description of the mechanisms involved in the development of renal failure in diabetes and hypertension is included. Evidence is presented to show that in addition to renoprotection offered by reduction in arterial pressure, some antihypertensive agents may give more nephroprotection. This added renoprotective potential of antihypertensive agents, which are either already in use or are being developed, is discussed. The nephroprotective action of conventional antihypertensive drugs, such as beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is briefly reviewed. It is noted that several studies indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be more effective in preventing or retarding renal failure than other conventional drugs. The renoprotective potential of newly developed agents, such as angiotensin II Type 1 receptor antagonists, vasopeptidase inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists is also examined. Emphasis is placed on a possible superior renoprotective effect of combination therapy over monotherapy.", 
    "601": "Restenosis, the re-narrowing of the lumen of the coronary artery, in the months following a successful percutaneous balloon angioplasty or stenting, remains the main limitation to percutaneous coronary revascularisation. Serial intravascular ultrasound studies have shown that restenosis after conventional balloon angioplasty represents a complex interplay between elastic recoil, smooth muscle proliferation and vascular remodelling, while restenosis after stent deployment is due almost entirely to smooth muscle hyperplasia and matrix proliferation. Despite intensive investigation in animal models and in clinical trials, most pharmacological agents have been found to be ineffective in preventing restenosis after percutaneous balloon angioplasty or stenting. Although studies frequently report success in the suppression of neointimal proliferation in animal models of balloon vascular injury, few of them have been successful in clinical trials. Lately, the advent of endovascular radiation, new antiproliferative agents, recombinant DNA, growth factor regulators and novel local drug delivery systems have shown promising results. In the past five years, intracoronary radiation with gamma- and beta-emitting sources has been evaluated intensively with very encouraging results. This is the first potent non-pharmacological approach that has been successful in a large number of patients in controlling excessive tissue proliferation. It is very likely that a combination of stents and pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia will likely result in further reductions in the incidence if restenosis. The continued attractiveness of percutaneous coronary revascularisation, as an alternative to medical treatment or bypass surgery for patients with coronary artery disease, will depend upon our ability to control the restenotic process. Due to the vast literature on the subject, this review will focus mainly on clinical trials that show the most promise and will highlight those that warrant further investigation.", 
    "602": "Heart failure remains a major and increasing cause of mortality and morbidity, even when the best available treatments are used. One of its key causes is neuroendocrine activation via the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Neuroendocrine blockers of the sympathetic nervous system (beta-blockers) and of the RAS (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 [AT1] receptor blockers) therefore have an important potential therapeutic role in heart failure. The promising results from clinical trials with beta-blockers suggest that these drugs will become an established part of the future management of patients with mild to moderate symptomatic heart failure. Blockade of the RAS with ACE inhibitors has also been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Blockade of the AT1-receptor, with agents such as candesartan, produces more specific and, theoretically, more complete blockade of the major negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II than is possible using ACE inhibitors, whilst maintaining placebo-like tolerability. Furthermore, AT1-receptor blockade leads to increased stimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor, which, according to experimental data, may have favourable cardiovascular effects. Following encouraging results from two pilot studies, a major new international study programme - CHARM (Candesartan in Heart failure - Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity) - has been initiated to define the clinical benefits of candesartan cilexetil in a wide variety of patients with symptomatic heart failure. CHARM is the first study to accept all relevant heart failure patients who may benefit from RAS blockade, irrespective of their left ventricular function or tolerance of ACE inhibitors. The 6500 patients to be recruited will be divided among three integrated outcome studies. Two of these studies will examine the effect of candesartan cilexetil versus placebo in patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less who are tolerant or intolerant of ACE inhibitors. The third study arm will examine the benefits of candesartan cilexetil in a previously seldom studied group: those with symptomatic heart failure, but with preserved left-ventricular systolic function. Recruitment of patients into the study has started.", 
    "603": "Prognosis can be improved in hypertensive patients not only by reducing blood pressure, but probably also by effective suppression of adverse neurohormonal influences. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors effectively reduces left ventricular hypertrophy and decreases morbidity and mortality due to heart failure, as well as slowing the progression of renal disease. Initial data from studies of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers indicate that these agents should also be effective in reducing cardiac and renal damage. In this class, candesartan, by virtue of its tight and long-lasting binding to the AT1-receptor, provides pronounced 24-h blood pressure control with effective blockade of all the major negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. Candesartan cilexetil has also been shown to be effective and well tolerated in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in those hypertensive patients who require more than one agent to reach their target blood pressure.", 
    "604": "Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers, such as candesartan, are attractive alternatives to ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are able to suppress the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), their mechanism of action may limit their clinical utility in the treatment of hypertension. For example, they act as competitive inhibitors of ACE. This means that their effects can be overcome by high levels of angiotensin I, which occur after ACE inhibition due to removal of the negative feedback effect of angiotensin II on renal renin release. ACE inhibitors are also unable to block the production of angiotensin II by non-ACE-mediated pathways. Furthermore, ACE is not a specific enzyme. Its inhibition therefore has effects on other substances, such as bradykinin, leading to the class-specific side effects associated with ACE inhibitors. Candesartan, on the other hand, binds insurmountably to the AT1-receptor, thereby providing more complete blockade of the negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II than is possible with ACE inhibitors. The specificity of AT1-receptor blockade also ensures that efficacy is achieved without inducing the side effect of cough that results from the non-specific consequences of ACE inhibition. Preclinical and early clinical studies demonstrate that AT1-receptor blockers produce at least the same degree of target-organ protection as has been demonstrated for ACE inhibitors. Additional benefits of AT1-receptor blockers may arise from the fact that, unlike ACE inhibitors, they do not prevent the activity of angiotensin II on AT2-receptors in the heart, which is thought to reduce cardiac remodelling. From a mechanistic perspective, therefore, AT1-receptor blockers appear to have advantages over ACE inhibitors, in terms of a more complete blockade of angiotensin II effects, while also avoiding the specific side effects associated with ACE inhibition.", 
    "605": "Suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is an established method for controlling blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition to reducing blood pressure, suppression of the RAS is able to protect against the target-organ damage that results from hypertension. Unfortunately, despite the use of ACE inhibitors and agents from the other classes of conventional antihypertensives, effective control of blood pressure remains poor. A major contribution to this failure to control blood pressure appears to be lack of compliance with the prescribed medication, arising from the presence of unacceptable side effects. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers, such as candesartan, are the latest class of antihypertensive agent to be developed. They target the AT1-receptor - the final common pathway for all the known negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II - and provide pronounced antihypertensive efficacy without the side effects of cough and angioneurotic oedema that are associated with the use of ACE inhibitors.",

The peptides have shown the effect as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The strongest action the peptide obtained after the proteolysis of beta-casein by synergic action of lactococci with pepsin has shown. It demonstrates a capability of formation of such peptides directly in milk products during their making and maturation under the action of proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria and milk clothing proteases.",

The medium dose of the drug administered acutely as well as the chronic treatment significantly attenuated acquisition of conditioned avoidance responses. None of the three doses of trandolapril changed consolidation of memory and recall of the passive avoidance behavior, object recognition, and locomotor exploratory activity in open field.

Furthermore, they conclude that the benefits of treatment are due to blood pressure lowering per se, rather than to any specific antihypertensive therapy. The results of the second Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension-2) are consistent with these recommendations, since in this trial angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists reduced blood pressure to the same extent as conventional therapy with beta-blockers and diuretics in elderly hypertensive patients, and the three treatments produced similar reductions in the risk of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, a first subgroup analysis of cardiovascular mortality showed that the three treatments seemed equally effective in diabetic patients.

A total of 6614 patients were randomized to receive conventional treatment, ACE inhibitors or calcium antagonists, and followed for a mean of 5 years. The primary endpoint was a combination of fatal stroke, fatal myocardial infarction and other fatal cardiovascular disease; secondary endpoints were a combination of fatal or non-fatal stroke or myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular mortality. The three treatments produced similar reductions in supine systolic blood pressure. There were no significant differences in the risk of cardiovascular events between patients receiving conventional therapy and those receiving newer therapies. All three treatments were well tolerated. The STOP-Hypertension-2 results thus add to the extensive literature showing the benefits of blood pressure reduction in elderly hypertensive patients. Moreover, they are consistent with current management guidelines which emphasise the importance of the achieved blood pressure reduction in the prevention of cardiovascular events.",

It is likely that increasing emphasis will be placed on control of isolated and borderline systolic hypertension, which are the predominant forms of hypertension in elderly patients. The recent second Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension-2) represents an important contribution to the literature since it shows that newer antihypertensive agents, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists, are as effective as older agents in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in elderly patients.",

ACE inhibitor therapy did not affect TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in freshly isolated mononuclear cells. Urine and serum TGF-beta1 protein levels were not affected by the administration of ACE inhibitors. However, possibly a longer duration of treatment would decrease TGF-beta1 levels in urine or blood.

Treatment was started 6 weeks after disease induction. As expected, lisinopril reduced blood pressure, proteinuria and the FGS score. In control rats, Adriamycin nephrosis was associated with significantly impaired GBM staining for both HSPG core protein (assessed from BL-31 staining) and HS staining (assessed from JM-403 staining) 12 weeks after disease induction. In rats treated with lisinopril (5 mg/kg/24 h) GBM staining was significantly better preserved for HS as well as for HSPG core protein.

    "661": "As the only ex utero mechanism for the removal of nitrogenous waste, the mammalian kidney achieves some 50-fold increase in urine production during the perinatal period when the placental circulation becomes no longer available as a functional dialyzer. This urine is efficiently removed from the kidney by the renal pelvis, a smooth muscle structure unique to mammals, which develops during the perinatal period. We found that mutant mice completely devoid of angiotensinogen or its type 1 receptor, as well as wild-type neonates given an ACE inhibitor, fail to develop a renal pelvis or a ureteral peristaltic movement. These structural and functional defects in the urinary tract are followed by severe obstructive injury of the renal parenchyma. The ability of angiotensin to directly induce the pelvis is demonstrated in an organ culture system, in which treatment with angiotensin induces the characteristic smooth muscle layer in the wild type, but not in homozygous null mutants. Upregulation of both renal angiotensin content and type 1 receptor at the renal hilum are also demonstrated in the wild type during the transition from intra- to extra-uterine life. By inducing the timely development of the renal pelvis, angiotensin thus facilitates the removal from the renal parenchyma of the urine that promptly increases at birth, thereby effectively preventing a buildup of intrarenal pressure and a consequent development of dysmorphic kidney.", 
    "662": "Two of the primary sites of actions for angiotensin (ANG)-(1---7) are the vasculature and the kidney. Because little information exists concerning the metabolism of ANG-(1---7) in these tissues, we investigated the hydrolysis of the peptide in rat lung and renal brush-border membrane (BBM) preparations. Radiolabeled ANG-(1---7) was hydrolyzed primarily to ANG-(1---5) by pulmonary membranes. The ANG-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril abolished the generation of ANG-(1---5), as well as that of smaller metabolites. Kinetic studies of the hydrolysis of ANG-(1---7) to ANG-(1---5) by somatic (pulmonary) and germinal (testes) forms of rat ACE yielded similar values, suggesting that the COOH-domain is responsible for the hydrolysis of ANG-(1---7). Pulmonary metabolism of ANG-(1---5) yielded ANG-(3---5) and was independent of ACE but may involve peptidyl or dipeptidyl aminopeptidases. In renal cortex BBM, ANG-(1---7) was rapidly hydrolyzed to mono- and dipeptide fragments and ANG-(1---4). Aminopeptidase (AP) inhibition attenuated the hydrolysis of ANG-(1---7) and increased ANG-(1---4) formation. Combined treatment with AP and neprilysin (Nep) inhibitors abolished ANG-(1---4) formation and preserved ANG-(1---7). ACE inhibition had no effect on the rate of hydrolysis or the metabolites formed in the BBM. In conclusion, ACE was the major enzymatic activity responsible for the metabolism of ANG-(1---7) in the lung, which is consistent with the ability of ACE inhibitors to increase the half-life of circulating ANG-(1---7) and raise endogenous levels of the peptide. An alternate pathway of metabolism was revealed in the renal cortex, where increased AP and Nep activities, relative to ACE activity, promote conversion of ANG-(1---7) to ANG-(1---4) and smaller fragments.", 
    "663": "Endothelial function was evaluated in renal and forearm vessels from patients with essential hypertension. First, the increase in renal blood flow evaluated by the clearance of para-aminohippurate, serum c-GMP and urinary NOx during L-arginine infusion was significantly attenuated in essential hypertension. This attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilation was improved by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, but unchanged by calcium antagonist. Second, the increase in forearm blood flow evaluated by plethysmography during acetylcholine infusion or reactive hyperemia was attenuated in essential hypertension. This attenuation was abolished by NO synthesis inhibitor. Forearm endothelial function was improved by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, daily aerobic exercise and body weight reduction by low calorie diet. In conclusion, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was attenuated in renal and forearm vasculature of essential hypertensives via reduction of NO synthesis. This attenuation can be improved by several treatments.", 
    "664": "Changes in 24-h profiles of arterial pressure following treatment with zolpidem were studied in 12 patients with essential arterial hypertension and chronic sleep problems on enalapril. One week treatment with zolpidem improved quality of sleep, increased a circadian index of systolic arterial pressure, 3 non-dipper patients recovered circadian rhythm of arterial pressure. The antihypertensive effect at night was higher when enalapril was used in combination with zolpidem than in monotherapy with enalapril.", 
    "665": "Heart failure is an increasingly common and costly chronic disorder, with a rising prevalence of at least 2% in populations over the age of 45 years, mortality rates that are as poor as common solid cancers, and very high health care utilisation costs. Despite increased evidence supporting a range of effective interventions, predominantly therapeutic, there remain significant degrees of physician underperformance in terms of heart failure diagnosis and management. Until the early 1990s, the management of heart failure was largely confined to the symptomatic relief of patients with well established heart failure in fluid overload. The introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provided the first treatments that beneficially altered the prognosis of patients with the most common expression of heart failure, namely established systolic dysfunction, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. Evidence has now extended these benefits to delaying progression of heart failure and reducing hospitalisation. Much of our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure stems from these studies. More recent data has clarified the limited role of digoxin, the important benefits of beta-blockade and aldosterone blockers as adjuvants to ACE inhibition, and the emerging evidence on angiotensin II antagonists. There are, in contrast to these positive findings, reliable data from Europe and North America revealing significant underperformance of primary care and hospital physicians in heart failure diagnosis and management, with evidence of underuse and underdosing of evidence-based therapies. Limited qualitative data suggest the reasons for this underperformance are complex and relate to lack of access to objective testing of ventricular function and exaggerated concerns over treatment risks and side-effects. Heart failure represents a complex cluster of aetiologies and risks that are not easy to correctly identify, even in specialist settings. Since there is now powerful evidence on how heart failure can be modified and improved, explicit guidance is needed for which suspected patients should be referred, for confirmation of diagnosis and advice on appropriate treatment regimes, and for which patients can be handled mainly within primary care but with enhanced access to objective non-invasive tests to improve diagnostic reliability and to stratify patients to evidence-based therapies. Current evidence suggests that in North America and Europe today primary care physicians do underperform in their management of patients with heart failure, often owing to factors outside of their immediate control.", 
    "666": "We investigated whether angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin-1(ET-1) are involved in submandibular hypertrophy in response to repeated treatment with isoproterenol (ISO) in rats. The immunoreactive Ang II (IRAng II) and immunoreactive ET-1 (IRET-1) contents of ISO-induced hypertrophy were significantly higher than those of control glands. Treatment of isolated gland tissues with ISO (1 microM) or dobutamine (1 microM) caused significant increases in the IRAng II and IRET- 1 contents of the glands compared with controls. These increases were suppressed by pretreatment with enalapril (3 microM) or captopril (3 microM). Treatment with Ang II (10 microM) also caused an increase in IRET-1 content. Our findings suggest that Ang II and ET-1 are involved in the submandibular gland hypertrophy that develops in rats repeatedly treated with ISO, and that these biologically active peptides may act as growth factors. They also imply that the tissue renin-angiotensin system and Ang II specific receptors are present in the submandibular glands.", 
    "667": "The systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is suppressed in normal aging, but the activity of the tissue RAS is not well defined. We examined the systemic and intrarenal RAS status of aging normal rats and responses to suppression and stimulation of the production of endogenous ANG II. Studies were performed in young (3 mo) and early aging (15 mo) male Sprague-Dawley rats. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors modestly decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) in young (3 mo) and early aging (15 mo) rats and limited proteinuria in the older rats. There were no significant age-related effects on renal function or on endogenous RAS activity. Intravenous infusion of the precursor ANG I led to comparable increases in MAP in younger and older rats. In contrast, the renal effects (reduction in glomerular filtration and plasma flow rates) were exaggerated in the older animals. Intrarenal arterial ANG I did not affect MAP in any group. In young rats, there were no significant hemodynamic effects in either the ipsilateral (infused) or the contralateral (noninfused) kidney. In the older rats, both kidneys had a significant fall in renal renal plasma flow rate (RPF) with left renal arterial infusion of ANG I. Accordingly, these studies early in the course of aging found only subtle changes in the activity, responsiveness, and metabolism of the RAS. Thus early aging is associated with a modest but important increase in sensitivity to RAS stimulation.", 
    "668": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) participates not only in the regulation of the extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure but also in the control of proliferating processes in the human organism. The favourable effect of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of essential hypertension may be caused also by their antiproliferative effect. The development of essential hypertension is probably of polygenic origin. The gene for ACE, and its alleles encountered commonly in the population is involved in the pathophysiology of systemic hypertension by acting on the dynamic properties of processes in the organism which regulate changes of the extracellular fluid volume and proliferation. Therefore it is necessary, when treating systemic hypertension with ACE inhibitors, to pay attention to monitoring of the blood pressure and organ changes. The relationship with blood pressure assessed by conventional methods need not be close. The antiproliferative effect of ACE inhibitors may be favourable in the treatment of hypertension and its clinical use in oncology may be taken into consideration.", 
    "669": "Endogenous peptidases participate in a major way in the formation of peptide pressor substances such as angiotensin II (A II) and endothelin (ET) as well as in the degradation of depressor substances, e.g. atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or bradykinin. They include on the one hand the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and endothelin converting enzyme (ECE), on the other hand kinase II for bradykinin and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) for ANP. Inhibition of these enzymatic reactions leads to a decline of vasopressors A II and ET and conversely delays the break-down of vasodilatating bradykinin and ANP. The main haemodynamic consequence of this double inhibition is a reduced peripheral vascular resistance and decline of the blood pressure. The concurrent block of both systems (dual inhibition) is more effective than the isolated block of one substance. The first dual endopeptidase inhibitors were ACE inhibitors blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to A II and inhibiting at the same time the degradation of bradykinin by kininase II which is identical with ACE. At present further substances were synthetized with a dual inhibitory effect e.g. on ECE and on NEP (phosphoramidone, thiorphan, ecadatril etc.). Under experimental conditions they have a long-term antihypertensive effect on the vascular wall and heart muscle. The development of another dual ACE and NEP inhibitor has reached already the stage of clinical tests and the first clinical studies. The preparation omapatrilate in amounts of 2.5-80 mg significantly reduced the BP in a dose-dependent way in mild and medium advanced essential hypertension. Normalization of the blood pressure, i.e. a drop below 140/90 mm Hg, was achieved with omapatrilate monotherapy in as many as 83% of patients with hypertension stage I and in 53% patients with essential hypertension stage II. The drop of blood pressure after 20-80 mg/day depended on the degree of hypertension and was comparable or better than monotherapy with lisonopril 20 mg/day or amlodipine 10 mg/day. Treatment with omapatrilate was well tolerated. Dual peptidase inhibitors interfering with the formation of pressor substances and with the degradation of depressor substances seem to be a perspective class of antihypertensives also useful in the treatment of other cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, primary pulmonary hypertension). Before its final inclusion in the therapeutic pattern, further comparative and clinical mortality studies must be implemented.", 
    "670": "Around 40% of the elderly population suffer from arterial hypertension. An effective antihypertensive treatment is therefore required. Calcium antagonists are used to treat hypertension because, owing to their mechanism of action, they can provoke systemic, as well as coronary vasodilatation. In this study the authors aimed to evaluate the activity and tolerability of diltiazem compared to ramipril in a group of elderly patients suffering from essential arterial hypertension.", 
    "671": "A controlled single-blind study was performed in which patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, A and B, consisting of 25 patients each, treated respectively with 300 mg sustained-release diltiazem or 5 mg ramipril in a single daily dose. The study lasted 6 months and evaluated systolic and diastolic pressure and heart rate.", 
    "672": "The evolution was positive in all patients in Group A and most patients in Group B, with the normalisation of both systolic and diastolic values. Heart rate showed a more persistent fall in Group A, but this was expected owing to the mechanism of action of diltiazem. No patient in Group A had to suspend treatment, whereas one patient in Group B had to interrupt therapy following the onset of a persistent cough.", 
    "673": "Both treatments resulted in similar changes in systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. In the light of these results, it can be affirmed that, at an oral dose of 300 mg/day, sustained-release diltiazem was found to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension in the aged.", 
    "674": "In autumn 1999 results of two well-controlled studies were published that are consistent with a frequent association between Helicobacter pylori seropositivity and coronary heart disease (CHD). Concerning the therapy of CHD, attention is mainly focused on new thrombolytic agents, bypass grafting (CABG) and balloon angioplasty (PTCA). In patients with intractable angina where aggressive medical therapy was exhausted and who were no longer candidates for CABG or PTCA, transmural laser revascularisation (TMLR), enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) and spinal cord stimulation can be considered. TMLR was shown to improve symptoms but not myocardial perfusion; the preoperative mortality accounts for 10-20%. In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, alcohol-induced transmural septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) reduces both the symptoms and the left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Although the prevalence of hypertension emergencies has dramatically diminished, the number of hypertensive patients with heart failure and end-stage renal disease is increasing. It is important to detect and treat mild hypertensives in early stages, especially diabetics and younger women with additional risk factors and/or proteinuria. The choice and dosage of drugs is to be individualised. In chronic heart failure (CHF), the protective effect of ACE inhibitors, metoprolol and carvedilol has been repeatedly shown in CHF stage NYHA II and III. The merit of ACE inhibitor and beta-blockers in high doses remains questionable in old patients and those with severe CHF (NYHA IV). In the latter indication, spirolactone was successfully reintroduced. Eplerenone (epoxymexrenone) is a new aldosterone antagonist with little affinity to other steroid receptors and has therefore less undesirable effects than spirolactone. The body of knowledge in therapeutic and technical progress in medicine of the 20th century are summarised and their positive and negative consequences briefly discussed.", 
    "675": "Because part of the cardioprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors results from their protective effects on cardiac bradykinin (BK) metabolism, the purpose of this study was to define the metabolism of BK in normal and failing human hearts and to compare the effect of omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI), which simultaneously inhibits both neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and ACE, with that of an ACE inhibitor. Exogenous BK at a nanomolar concentration was incubated alone, in the presence of an ACE inhibitor (ramiprilat, 36 nM), or in the presence of a VPI (omapatrilat, 61 nM) with left ventricular membranes prepared from normal donor hearts (n = 7), and hearts from patients with an ischemic (n = 11) or dilated (n = 12) cardiomyopathy (DCM). The half-lives calculated for BK alone (199 +/- 60, 224 +/- 108, and 283 +/- 122 s; P = NS) exhibited similar values for normal, ischemic, and DCM heart tissues, respectively. Ramiprilat significantly increased the half-life of BK (P <.01), but the effect was similar for the three kinds of tissues (297 +/- 104, 267 +/- 157, and 407 +/- 146 s, respectively; P = NS). The potentiating effect of the VPI omapatrilat on the kinetic parameter of BK (478 +/- 210, 544 +/- 249, and 811 +/- 349 s, respectively) was greater than that of the ACE inhibitor (P <.01). Moreover, omapatrilat had a more important potentiating effect with DCM than normal heart membranes (P <.05). These results show that not only ACE but also and mainly NEP play an important role in the degradation of BK in human heart membranes. Omapatrilat, a VPI, has a greater protective effect on BK metabolism than that of a pure ACE inhibitor. Thus, inhibition of both ACE and NEP with omapatrilat could be more cardioprotective than ACE inhibition alone.", 
    "676": "Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, enalaprilat and imidaprilat, on bradykinin (BK) metabolizing enzymes, aminopeptidase P (APP), neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and carboxypeptidase N (CPN), were examined. APP activity in the mouse lung was inhibited by enalaprilat in a concentration-dependent manner while imidaprilat did not influence the enzyme activity. The inhibitory effects of these ACE inhibitors on the NEP activity in the mouse lung and the CPN activity in the mouse serum were negligible. These data suggested that the influence of enalaprilat on the APP activity and subsequent BK metabolism are different from those of imidaprilat.", 
    "677": "The effect of enalapril and low prednisone doses on the urinary protein electrophoretic pattern was studied in 13 pediatric patients with glomerular diseases and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Enalapril was administered at doses of 0.2-0.6 mg/kg per day for 24-84 months, and prednisone was introduced 2 months later in 11 patients at doses of 30 mg/m2 on alternate days. The urine protein electrophoretic pattern showed a reduction of 80% and 70% in the total protein and albumin, respectively, after enalapril. Total urinary protein decreased from 5.46 to 1.1 g/m2 per day (P<0.001). A marked change from a pattern of non-selective urinary protein loss to an albumin-selective proteinuria was observed. Mean total plasma proteins increased from 4.7 to 5.43 g/dl (P<0.001). Four patients became free of proteinuria 24 months after enalapril was started, but only 2 remained free of proteinuria at 48 months of follow-up. The other 11 patients had persistent albuminuria of between 0.5 and 2.6 g/m2 per day with a selective urinary electrophoretic pattern. No additional decrease was observed after steroids were introduced. A clinical improvement in edema was observed in all children. Three patients developed transient acute renal failure, during the course of an infectious disease; 2 developed peritonitis and 1 pneumopathy. In these patients withdrawal of enalapril was necessary until a complete recovery of renal function was observed. Four patients were hypertensive on admission, achieving normal blood pressure 1 month after enalapril was started. No episodes of systemic arterial hypotension were seen. Creatinine clearance and serum potassium showed no statistically significant change.", 
    "678": "We have retrospectively reviewed our single-center experience of the treatment of early onset nephrotic syndrome (NS). From 1991 to 1998, ten children with NS were treated. Kidney biopsy showed focal sclerosis (n=1), diffuse mesangial sclerosis (n=7), and congenital NS of the Finnish type (n=2). Associated conditions included incomplete Drash syndrome (n=1), Galloway-Mowat syndrome (n=1), and severe mental and motor retardation of unknown origin (n=3). From 1991 to 1997, five children with NS were treated. Bilateral nephrectomy (NX) was performed in three, one patient with severe retardation died at 4 years and NX was not performed in one patient who showed satisfactory growth and development. Three of these children were dialyzed and two were successfully transplanted. One patient was transplanted without previous dialysis. From 1997 to 1998, five children were treated with a regimen that included captopril and indomethacin (CAPTO/INDO). CAPTO/ INDO was successful in increasing serum protein in all patients and producing growth and development in four patients. In two patients CAPTO/INDO was successful only after unilateral NX. Our experience indicates that CAPTO/INDO may be a valuable treatment in patients with early onset NS. An individualized stepwise approach including unilateral NX should be considered to achieve optimal results.", 
    "679": "Pharmacological interruption or genetic disruption of the renin-angiotensin system before completion of nephrogenesis produces papillary atrophy and an impaired urinary concentrating ability. The mechanisms involved are yet to be elucidated, but renal hypoperfusion and subsequent ischemia, particularly to the immature renal medulla, may be hypothesized. The acute intrarenal responses to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the newborn piglet were thus investigated by means of regional blood flow distribution, renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP), and medullary oxygen tension (PO2) in the anesthetised 4- to 5-day-old piglet. Moreover, the calcium antagonist nifedipine and the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor L-NAME were also given in order to reduce renal blood flow by other means. The drugs were given intravenously in equipotent pressor doses, mimicking intraperitoneal injections in neonatal rats. Enalaprilat (200 microg/kg) reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 14+/-10% (mean+/-SD, P=0.006) and RIHP by 18+/-18% (P=0.001), whereas total renal blood flow and medullary PO2 remained unchanged. In contrast, nifedipine (0.5 mg/kg) reduced MAP and RIHP by 39+/-8% and 38+/-14%, respectively, total and regional blood flows by 30%-60%, and medullary PO, by 46+/-29% (P=0.001). Acute administration of L-NAME (15 mg/kg) increased MAP by 27+/-10% (P=0.0005), whereas RIHP and renal blood flow decreased by 20%-50%, resulting in a reduction of the medullary PO2 by 10+/-12% (P=0.05). We conclude that the renal abnormalities observed after neonatal ACE inhibition are not likely to be caused by renal ischemia.", 
    "680": "Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) are both common forms of dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. A few case reports have suggested that cough is associated with PD. From 1991 to 1998, 17 patients being treated with PD at the Toronto Western Hospital demonstrated persistent cough severe enough for referral to a respirologist. Causes of cough, often more than one cause per patient, included asthma, post-nasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, allergic rhinitis, pleural effusion, and respiratory infection. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to establish the prevalence of cough among PD patients, to determine if PD patients more commonly have a dry persistent cough than do HD patients, and, if the latter case is true, the possible reasons for it. A detailed survey of 92 PD patients and 91 HD patients was conducted in 1998 and 1999 at the University Health Network. Survey questions inquired about patient respiratory symptoms since onset of dialysis. Charts were reviewed to obtain information on use of medications possibly relevant to cough. In the PD and HD groups, 52% and 23% were females (p = 0.001), and the mean ages were 59.1 and 60.1 years, respectively. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors had been taken by 65% (PD) and 55% (HD) of patients, and beta-blocking medications by 43% (PD) and 51% (HD). Since initiation of dialysis--mean 2.7 years (PD) and 3.7 years (HD)--22% of PD patients reported persistent cough versus 7% of HD patients (p = 0.003). Although no significant association was seen between cough and self-reported heartburn in HD patients (p = 0.439), a significant association between cough and self-reported heartburn was seen in PD patients: 67% of PD patients with persistent cough reported heartburn versus 29% of those without cough (p = 0.008). The findings suggest that GERD and associated cough are more common in PD patients than in HD patients, perhaps owing to increases in intra-abdominal pressure from the peritoneal dialysate.", 
    "681": "Chronic heart failure is an increasing cause of hospital admission in the Netherlands and Belgium. Despite numerous medical treatment modalities, the mortality remains high. Recent placebo-controlled randomized studies suggest that the addition of beta-blockers in stabilized, optimally pretreated patients with chronic heart failure using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics and digitalis, is accompanied by an additional absolute decrease in mortality by about 5% and a relative decrease in mortality by about 35%. Also the number hospitalization frequency decreases. Initially, the beneficial effects of beta-blockers on symptoms are only minor or absent. During the initiation period some clinical deterioration may occur which has to be treated accordingly; these patients are, however, difficult to identify. Initiation has to be done using low doses and should be restricted to stabilized, optimally treated patients. Doses should only be increased every 2 to 4 weeks until target doses are reached. These findings must not be extrapolated automatically to all cases of heart failure, since patients in the trials may differ considerably from those encountered in general practice.", 
    "682": "Random, nontimed blood pressure (BP) measurements in the outpatient clinic may fail to provide reliable information on actual daily BP control in renal patients on chronic antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "683": "In a cohort of 163 patients with proteinuric chronic nephropathies followed prospectively with repeated BP and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurements, we compared baseline and follow-up pretreatment, morning (\"trough,\" measured by standard procedures, and \"0 minutes,\" measured by an automatic device) and post-treatment (120 minutes) measurements, with BP monitored up to 600 minutes after treatment administration. We then evaluated which BP value most reliably predicted GFR decline (delta GFR) and progression to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 20 (9 to 25) months.", 
    "684": "GFR decline was more reliably predicted by systolic as compared with diastolic BP and by pretreatment as compared to post-treatment BP, regardless of the timing and method of measurement, respectively. In particular, at the 120-minute baseline and follow-up measurements, systolic BP had no predictive value in patients with less severe renal insufficiency and baseline diastolic BP, regardless of the level of renal dysfunction. The BP predictive value was remarkably higher in ramipril than in conventionally treated patients. All follow-up-but no baseline-measurements reliably predicted the risk of ESRF in the entire study group.", 
    "685": "In patients with progressive chronic nephropathies, systolic BP and pretreatment morning BP measurements are the most reliable predictors of disease outcome and may serve to guide antihypertensive therapy in routine clinical activities and in prospective controlled trials, particularly in patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Reliability and relevance of single measurements taken at different times after treatment administration are questionable.", 
    "686": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is known to raise serum potassium [K(+)] levels in patients with renal insufficiency or diabetes. No study has evaluated the comparative effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor versus an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on the changes in serum [K(+)] in people with renal insufficiency.", 
    "687": "The study was a multicenter, randomized, double crossover design, with each period lasting one month. A total of 35 people (21 males and 14 females, 19 African Americans and 16 Caucasian) participated, with the mean age being 56 +/- 2 years. Mean baseline serum [K(+)] was 4.4 +/- 0.1 mEq/L. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 65 +/- 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and blood pressure was 150 +/- 2/88 +/- 1 mm Hg. The main outcome measure was the difference from baseline in the level of serum [K+], plasma aldosterone, and GFR following the initial and crossover periods.", 
    "688": "For the total group, serum [K(+)] changes were not significantly different between the lisinopril or valsartan treatments. The subgroup with GFR values of < or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who received lisinopril demonstrated significant increases in serum [K(+)] of 0.28 mEq/L above the mean baseline of 4.6 mEq/L (P = 0.04). This increase in serum [K(+)] was also accompanied by a decrease in plasma aldosterone (P = 0.003). Relative to the total group, the change in serum [K(+)] from baseline to post-treatment in the lisinopril group was higher among those with GFR values of < or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The lower GFR group taking valsartan, however, demonstrated a smaller rise in serum [K(+)], 0.12 mEq/L above baseline (P = 0.1), a 43% lower value when compared with the change in those who received lisinopril. This blunted rise in [K(+)] in people taking valsartan was not associated with a significant decrease in plasma aldosterone (P = 0.14).", 
    "689": "In the presence of renal insufficiency, the ARB valsartan did not raise serum [K(+)] to the same degree as the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. This differential effect on serum [K(+)] is related to a relatively smaller reduction in plasma aldosterone by the ARB and is not related to changes in GFR. This study provides evidence that increases in serum [K(+)] are less likely with ARB therapy compared with ACE inhibitor therapy in people with renal insufficiency.", 
    "690": "In a radioligand binding study using bovine coronary artery endothelial cell membranes, captopril changed a single bradykinin (BK) binding site (Kd = 1.77 nM, Bmax = 60.2 fmol/mg protein) to high- (Kd = 0.68 pM, Bmax = 17.7 fmol/mg protein) and low- (Kd = 1.00 nM, Bmax = 72.5 fmol/mg protein) affinity binding sites. This effect was reversed by GppNHp. Captopril also enhanced BK-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation in saponin-treated coronary rings, and GppNHp partially suppressed this enhancement. These results suggest that captopril may affect BK receptors that couple to G-proteins.",

SM-19712 inhibited endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) solubilized from rat lung microsomes with an IC50 value of 42 nM and, at 10 - 100 microM, had no effect on other metalloproteases such as neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and angiotensin converting enzyme, showing a high specificity for ECE. In cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells, SM-19712 at 1 - 100 microM concentration-dependently inhibited the endogenous conversion of big endothelin-1 (ET-1) to ET-1 with an IC50 value of 31 microM. In anesthetized rats, either intravenous (1-30 mg/kg) or oral (10-30 mg/kg) administration of SM-19712 dose-dependently suppressed the pressor responses induced by big ET-1. In acute myocardial infarction of rabbits subjected to coronary occlusion and reperfusion, SM-19712 reduced the infarct size, the increase in serum concentration of ET-1 and the serum activity of creatinine phosphokinase. The present study demonstrates that SM-19712 is a structurally novel, nonpeptide, potent and selective inhibitor of ECE, and SM-19712 is a valuable new tool for elucidating the pathophysiological role of ECE.",

These studies measure the trade-off between costs and benefits using the cost-effectiveness ratio (CE ratio), which is defined as the net incremental cost per unit of benefit provided by the candidate therapy. In this paper we review the statistical methods which have been proposed for estimating 95 per cent confidence intervals for cost-effectiveness ratios. We show that the use of an angular transformation of the standardized ratio stabilizes the variance of the estimated CE ratio, and provides a clearer interpretation of study results. An estimate of the 95 per cent confidence interval for the CE ratio in the transformed scale is easily made using the jack-knife or bootstrap. The available methods are compared using data from a long term study of mortality in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "693": "Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy in rats has been induced by the intraperitoneal injections of PAN. One group of animals which received PAN has been treated simultaneously with captopril (angiotensine converting enzyme-ACE-inhibitor) with the aim to test whether continuing treatment with captopril along with PAN injections would be able to modulate the toxic effects of PAN. The third group of rats was given only captopril. Morphological changes in the kidney were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy that showed the loss of podocyte foot processes in the kidney of PAN treated animals but also in the kidney of captopril treated ones as well as in the animals treated with both drugs simultaneously. Reduced glutathione content, catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), xanthine oxidase activities as well as lipid peroxides were investigated in rat blood and kidney. Captopril given alone produced a significant decrease of plasma lipid peroxides, but it did not show any significant effect on investigated antioxidative factor levels neither in blood nor in the kidney. PAN given alone produced a significant depletion of plasma lipid peroxides, kidney catalase and erythrocyte GSH-Px activity as well as a significant increase of plasma catalase and erythrocyte SOD activity. Treatment of animals with both drugs simultaneously resulted in a significant increase of erythrocyte SOD activity and a significant decrease of plasma lipid peroxides, erythrocyte GSH-Px and kidney SOD activities. Kidney xanthine oxidase activity showed a significant increase in both PAN and PAN plus captopril treated animals in comparison with the values of captopril treated rats. These data suggest that PAN changes the antioxidative factor pattern in rat blood and kidney. Contrary to our expectations that captopril may protect the toxic effects of PAN it only to a certain extent modifies these effects showing protective effect only on tissue catalase activity.", 
    "694": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors, such as omapatrilat are single molecules that simultaneously inhibit neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). In normotensive rats, a single dose of oral omapatrilat (10 mg/kg) and 1 mg/kg inhibited plasma ACE (P < .01) for 24 h and increased plasma renin activity for 8 h (P < .01). In vitro autoradiography using the specific NEP inhibitor radioligand 125I-RB104 and the specific ACE inhibitor radioligand 125I-MK351A showed omapatrilat (10 mg/kg) caused rapid and potent inhibition of renal NEP and ACE, respectively, for 24 h (P < .01). In spontaneously hypertensive rats, 10 days of oral omapatrilat (40 mg/kg/day) reduced blood pressure (vehicle 237 +/- 4 mm Hg; omapatrilat, 10 mg/kg, 212 +/- 4 mm Hg; omapatrilat 40 mg/kg, 197 +/- 4 mm Hg, P < .01) in a dose-dependent manner (10 v 40 mg/kg, P < .01). Left ventricular hypertrophy was significantly reduced by high-dose omapatrilat (vehicle 2.76 +/- 0.03 mg/g body weight; omapatrilat, 10 mg/kg, 2.71 +/- 0.02 mg/g; omapatrilat 40 mg/kg, 2.55 +/- 0.02 mg/g, P < .01) and omapatrilat also increased kidney weight compared to vehicle (both doses, P < .01). Omapatrilat caused significant inhibition of plasma ACE and increased plasma renin activity (both doses, P < .01), and in vitro autoradiographic studies indicated sustained inhibition of renal ACE and NEP (both doses, P < .01). Omapatrilat is a potent vasopeptidase inhibitor, and its antihypertensive effects are associated with inhibition of NEP and ACE at the tissue level and beneficial effects on cardiovascular structure. Relating the degree of tissue inhibition to physiologic responses may allow further definition of the role of local renin angiotensin and natriuretic peptide systems in the beneficial effects of vasopeptidase inhibitors.", 
    "695": "The renin-angiotensin system and endothelin are important regulators of the cardiovascular system. Although increased production of endothelin-1 (ET-1) is reported in patients with heart failure, the detailed mechanism remains to be determined. To elucidate the relationship between the renin-angiotensin system and ET-1 in hypertensive heart failure, we evaluated the effects of long-term treatment with imidapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on preproET-1, endothelin A receptor (ETAR), and ACE mRNA expression in the left ventricle and evaluated these in relation to myocardial remodeling in the failing heart of Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) hypertensive rats fed a high salt diet. In DS rats fed an 8% NaCl diet after the age of 6 weeks, a stage of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy at 11 weeks (DSLVH) was followed by a distinct stage of left ventricular failure with chamber dilatation at 18 weeks (DSHF). Imidapril (DSHF-IM, n = 8, 1 mg/kg/day, subdepressor dose) or vehicle (DSHF-V, n = 8) was given from stage DSLVH to DSHF for 7 weeks, and age-matched (18 weeks) Dahl salt-resistant rats fed the same diet served as the control group (DR-C, n = 8). In both groups, blood pressure was similar and significantly higher than in DR-C. Markedly increased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and reduced fractional shortening in DSHF-V was significantly ameliorated in DSHF-IM using transthoracic echocardiography. The preproET-1, ETAR, and ACE mRNA levels in the left ventricle were significantly increased in DSHF-V compared with DR-C, and significantly suppressed in DSHF-IM compared with DSHF-V. DSHF-V demonstrated a significant increase in the wall-to-lumen ratio and perivascular fibrosis in coronary arterioles, and myocardial fibrosis, with all these parameters being significantly improved by imidapril. In conclusion, myocardial remodeling and heart failure in DS rats fed a high salt diet were significantly ameliorated by a subdepressor dose of imidapril, which may be attributable to a decrease in ET-1 mRNA expression and angiotensin II in the left ventricle.",

Data from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995 were used. From 1980 to 1995, there was no significant trend in the percentage of hypertension visits that did not mention any antihypertensive drug (20% to 27%). Further analyses focused on those hypertension visits in which at least 1 antihypertensive drug was used. Across the years, antihypertensive drug visits mentioning calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors significantly increased; those noting diuretics significantly decreased. However, in 1995, antihypertensive drug visits that included a diuretic and/or a beta-adrenergic blocker equalled 53%; these are the antihypertensive drug classes preferred by the JNC V. Physician antihypertensive drug prescribing was generally consistent with the basic antihypertensive drug guidelines of the JNC reports.", 
    "701": "Vascular relaxation via endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) declines in association with aging and also with hypertension, and antihypertensive treatment improves the endothelial dysfunction connected with hypertension. We tested whether the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor improves EDHF-mediated responses in normotensive rats, with special reference to the age-related process. Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were treated with either 20 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) enalapril (WKY-E group) or a combination of 50 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) hydralazine and 7.5 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) hydrochlorothiazide (WKY-H group) from 9 to 12 months of age. Twelve-month-old WKY (WKY-O) and 3-month-old WKY (WKY-Y) served as controls (n=6 to 10 in each group). The 2 treatments lowered systolic blood pressure comparably. EDHF-mediated hyperpolarization to acetylcholine (ACh) in mesenteric arteries was significantly improved in WKY-E, but not in WKY-H, compared with WKY-O, and the hyperpolarization in WKY-E was comparable to that in WKY-Y (hyperpolarization to 10(-)(5) mol/L ACh in the presence of norepinephrine: WKY-O, -14+/-2 mV; WKY-E, -22+/-3 mV; WKY-H, -15+/-2 mV; and WKY-Y, -28+/-0 mV). EDHF-mediated relaxation, as assessed by relaxation to ACh in norepinephrine-precontracted rings in the presence of indomethacin and NO synthase inhibitor, was also significantly improved in WKY-E, but not in WKY-H, to a level comparable to that in WKY-Y (maximum relaxation: WKY-O, 45+/-6%; WKY-E, 63+/-8%; WKY-H, 43+/-4%; and WKY-Y, 72+/-4%). Hyperpolarization and relaxation to levcromakalim, an ATP-sensitive K(+) channel opener, were similar in all groups. These findings suggest that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prevents the age-related decline in EDHF-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation in normotensive rats, presumably through an inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "702": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor improves the impaired hyperpolarization and relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) via endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We tested whether the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist also improves EDHF-mediated responses and whether the combined AT(1) receptor blockade and ACE inhibition exert any additional effects. SHR were treated with either AT(1) receptor antagonist TCV-116 (5 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) (SHR-T), enalapril (40 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) (SHR-E), or their combination (SHR-T&E) from 8 to 11 months of age. Age-matched, untreated SHR (SHR-C) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats served as controls (n=8 to 12 in each group). Three treatments lowered blood pressure comparably. EDHF-mediated hyperpolarization to ACh in mesenteric arteries in the absence or presence of norepinephrine was significantly improved in all treated SHR. In addition, the hyperpolarization in the presence of norepinephrine was significantly greater in SHR-T&E than in SHR-E (ACh 10(-5) mol/L with norepinephrine: SHR-C -7; SHR-T -19; SHR-E -15; SHR-T&E -22; WKY -14 mV). EDHF-mediated relaxation, assessed in the presence of indomethacin and N:(G)-nitro-L-arginine, was markedly improved in all treated SHR. Hyperpolarization and relaxation to levcromakalim, a direct opener of ATP-sensitive K(+)-channel, were similar in all groups. These findings suggest that AT(1) receptor antagonists are as effective as ACE inhibitors in improving EDHF-mediated responses in SHR. The beneficial effects of the combined AT(1) receptor blockade and ACE inhibition appears to be for the most part similar to those of each intervention.", 
    "703": "Kidney function and structure were compared in control rats (group 1) and in 3 groups of rats made hypertensive by administration of aldosterone and saline for 8 weeks (groups 2, 3, and 4). Group 2 rats received only aldosterone and saline, while group 3 also received losartan and group 4 also received enalapril. Rats in all groups were subjected to uninephrectomy before beginning the experiment. Hypertension and proteinuria in rats given aldosterone and saline were not affected by losartan or enalapril (8-week values for blood pressure in mm Hg: 135+/-3 group 1, 193+/-4 group 2, 189+/-4 group 3, 189+/-5 group 4; P<0.05 groups 2, 3, and 4 versus 1; 8-week values for proteinuria in mg/d: 44+/-8 group 1, 278+/-34 group 2, 267+/-37 group 3, 289+/-36 group 4; P<0.05 groups 2, 3, and 4 versus 1). Vascular, glomerular, and tubulointerstitial injury accompanied hypertension and proteinuria at 8 weeks. Losartan and enalapril did not prevent vascular injury, which was characterized by thickening of arterial and arteriolar walls and by fibrinoid necrosis and thrombotic microangiopathy. Likewise, losartan and enalapril did not reduce the prevalence of glomerular segmental sclerosis (1+/-1% group 1, 10+/-2% group 2, 11+/-2% group 3, 13+/-2% group 4; P<0.05 groups 2, 3, and 4 versus 1) or limit tubulointerstitial injury as reflected by the volume fraction of the cortical interstitium (15+/-1% group 1, 20+/-1% group 2, 21+/-1% group 3, 21+/-1% group 4; P<0.05 groups 2, 3, and 4 versus 1). These findings suggest that local angiotensin II activity does not contribute to the development of renal injury in mineralocorticoid-salt hypertension.", 
    "704": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and endothelin system may both play a role in the pathogenesis of progressive renal injury. The aims of the present study were 3-fold: first, to explore the possible benefits of dual blockade of the RAS with an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin type 1(AT1) receptor antagonist; second, to examine the relative efficacy of endothelin A receptor antagonism (ETA-RA) compared with combined endothelin A/B receptor antagonism (ETA/B-RA); and third, to assess whether interruption of both RAS and endothelin system had any advantages over single-system blockade. Subtotally nephrectomized rats were studied as a model of progressive renal injury and randomly assigned to one of the following treatments for 12 weeks: perindopril (ACE inhibitor), irbesartan (AT1 receptor antagonist), BMS193884 (ETA-RA), bosentan (ETA/B-RA), and a combination of irbesartan with either perindopril or BMS193884. Treatment with irbesartan or perindopril was associated with an improved glomerular filtration rate and reductions in blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, glomerulosclerosis, and tubular injury in association with reduced gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta(1) and matrix protein type IV collagen. The combination of irbesartan with perindopril was associated with further reductions in blood pressure and urinary protein excretion. No beneficial effects of either BMS193884 or bosentan were noted. Furthermore, the addition of BMS193884 to irbesartan did not confer any additional benefits. These findings suggest that the RAS but not the endothelin system is a major mediator of progressive renal injury after renal mass reduction and that the combination of an AT1 receptor antagonist with an ACE inhibitor may have advantages over the single agent of RAS blocker treatment.", 
    "705": "Hypertension with renal artery stenosis is associated with both an activated renin-angiotensin system and elevated sympathetic activity. Therefore, in this condition it may be favorable to use a therapeutic modality that does not reflexly increase heart rate, renin secretion, and sympathetic nervous activity. The purpose of the present study was to assess overall, renal, and muscle sympathetic activity after short-term administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalaprilat) and a nonspecific vasodilator (dihydralazine) to hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis. Forty-eight patients undergoing a clinical investigation for renovascular hypertension were included in the study. An isotope dilution technique for assessing norepinephrine spillover was used to estimate overall and bilateral renal sympathetic nerve activity. In 11 patients simultaneous intraneural recordings of efferent muscle sympathetic nerve activity were performed. Thirty minutes after dihydralazine administration, mean arterial pressure fell by 15%, whereas plasma angiotensin II, muscle sympathetic nerve activity, heart rate, and total body norepinephrine spillover increased (P<0.05 for all). In contrast, after enalaprilat administration a fall in arterial pressure similar to that for dihydralazine was followed by decreased angiotensin II levels and unchanged muscle sympathetic nerve activity, heart rate, and total body norepinephrine spillover, whereas renal norepinephrine spillover increased by 44% (P<0.05). Acute blood pressure reduction by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor provokes a differentiated sympathetic response in patients with hypertension and renal artery stenosis, inasmuch that overall and muscle sympathetic reflex activation are blunted, whereas the reflex renal sympathetic response to blood pressure reduction is preserved.", 
    "706": "Omapatrilat is a member of the new drug class of vasopeptidase inhibitors that may offer benefit in the treatment of heart failure (HF) through simultaneous inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. We examined the effects of omapatrilat in a placebo-controlled crossover study using a pacing model of HF. Seven sheep were paced sequentially at 180 bpm (mild HF) and then 225 bpm (severe HF) for 7 days each. Omapatrilat (0.005 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by intravenous bolus on days 4 to 7 of each paced period. Omapatrilat lowered mean arterial and left atrial pressure and increased cardiac output acutely and chronically in both mild and severe HF (P<0.01 for all). Plasma atrial and brain natriuretic peptide and cGMP levels were stable acutely (P=NS), while brain natriuretic peptide increased after repeated dosing in severe HF (P<0.05). Plasma renin activity rose, whereas angiotensin II and aldosterone levels fell after acute and repeated dosing in both states (P<0.01 for all). Omapatrilat increased urinary sodium excretion by day 7 in both mild and severe HF (P<0.05). Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate increased or were stable after omapatrilat in mild and severe HF after both acute and repeated dosing. Omapatrilat exhibited pronounced acute and sustained beneficial hemodynamic and renal effects in both mild and severe heart failure.", 
    "707": "Aldosterone is synthesized in extra-adrenal tissues, both blood vessels and brain. We undertook the present study to determine whether the rat heart produces aldosterone and to investigate the effects of adrenalectomy, ACE inhibition, and angiotensin II on aldosterone synthesis in the heart. To clarify the pathophysiological role of cardiac aldosterone in the hypertensive heart, we compared the synthesis of aldosterone in the hearts of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) with that in Wistar-Kyoto rats. The effects of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone on myocardial hypertrophy in adrenalectomized SHRSP were also studied. Isolated rat hearts were perfused for 2 hours, and the perfusate was analyzed with HPLC and mass spectrometry. The activity of aldosterone synthase was estimated on the basis of the conversion of [(14)C]deoxycorticosterone to [(14)C]aldosterone. The levels of aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) mRNA were determined with competitive polymerase chain reaction. Aldosterone production, the activity of aldosterone synthase, and the expression of CYP11B2 mRNA were increased in hearts from adrenalectomized rats and rats treated with angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors decreased cardiac aldosterone synthesis. Cardiac aldosterone, aldosterone synthase activity, and CYP11B2 mRNA levels in hearts from 2- and 4-week-old SHRSP were significantly greater than those of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats. Spironolactone prevented cardiac hypertrophy in adrenalectomized SHRSP. These results suggest that the rat heart produces aldosterone and that endogenous cardiac aldosterone may affect cardiac function and hypertrophy in hypertension in rats.",

ACE inhibitors added at the peak of the contraction immediately enhanced it further (343 +/- 40%), although the ileum inactivated BK slowly (t(1/2) = 12-16 min). Chymotrypsin and cathepsin G also augmented the activity of BK up to three- or four-fold, but in a manner slower than that of ACE inhibitors. The BK B(2) receptor blocker HOE 140 inhibited all effects. Histamine and angiotensin II were not potentiated. ACE inhibitors potentiate BK independent of blocking its inactivation by inducing crosstalk between ACE and the BK B(2) receptor; proteases activate the receptor by different mechanism.",

Metalloendopeptidase 24.15, carboxypeptidase M, and an unidentified peptidase are responsible for their formation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 do not play a crucial role in the degradation of bradykinin by macrophages.

L-NCT alone and L-NCT+ENA reduced tNEPI toward normal (28+/-4 and 39+/-17 pg/mL respectively), whereas HD-NCT reduced tNEPI to below normal levels (3+/-10 pg/mL). In PL dogs, LVEF decreased but was unchanged with L-NCT and increased with L-NCT+ENA.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema was suspected and the medication was discontinued. The patient has remained symptom-free while not taking the ACE inhibitor for 1 year. Review of the literature reveals only nine similar cases. All cases, including ours, occurred in women.

Generally, these are transport mechanisms for amino acids, dipeptides, monosaccharides, monocarboxylic acids, organic cations, phosphates, nucleosides, and water-soluble vitamins. Among them, the dipeptide transporter mechanism has received the most attention. Dipeptide transporters are H(+)-coupled, energy-dependent transporters that are known to play an essential role in the oral absorption of beta-lactam antibiotics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, renin inhibitors, and an anti-tumor drug, bestatin. Moreover, several investigators have demonstrated the utility of the dipeptide transporter as a platform for improving the oral bioavailability of drugs such as zidovudine and acyclovir through dipeptide prodrug derivatization. Thus far, at least four proton-coupled peptide transporters have been cloned. The first one cloned was PepT1 from the rabbit small intestine.

    "728": "We previously demonstrated that captopril (CP) exhibited a high ability to inhibit enzymatically generated leukotrienes, particularly LTB(4), from stimulated intact human neutrophils. This finding together with the immunosuppressive effect of CP have proposed a possible antiinflammatory activity for the drug. Thus, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of CP on immunologically mediated chronic inflammation; two models were chosen, namely, Freund's adjuvant arthritis and mixed-type hypersensitivity in rat. The effect of CP was assessed on the basis of physical parameter (paw edema) and biochemical markers in blood and inflammatory exudate. CP was given daily during the course of inflammation development. It was administered ip at three doses, viz. 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg. The results claimed that CP succeeded in suppressing edema evolution in hind paws of Freund's arthritic animals, during all phases of the disease. During the chronic phase of inflammation, in either model, CP reduced the elevated serum and exudate (local) LTB(4) and IL-6 levels. The effect on LTB(4) was more pronounced in the exudate and tended to be dose-related. The antiarthritic effect of CP was also accompanied by augmentation of serum level of protein thiols, with reduction or normalization of elevated systemic and/or local levels of lipid peroxide, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione. It could be concluded that long-term treatment with CP confers a good antiinflammatory activity against arthritis in rat, leading to improvement of the oxidative stress induced by the arthritic insult. The reparative effect of the drug could be mediated via reduction of LTB(4) and IL-6.",

    "734": "Sixty five trials were identified involving in excess of 11,500 patients; a further 5 trials are ongoing. Data were obtained for 32 trials (5,368 patients). Significant imbalances in baseline blood pressure were present across trials of intravenous calcium channel blockers and prostacyclin. Major imbalances in baseline blood pressure between treatment and control groups have made the interpretation of these results difficult. Intravenous calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and oral CCBs significantly lowered late blood pressure as compared to controls. (systolic/diastolic BP): iv CCBs -8.2/-6.7 mm Hg (95% CI -12.6 to -3.8)/ (95% CI -9.2 to -4.3); oral CCBs -3.2/-2.1 mm Hg (95% CI -5.0 to -1.3)/ (95% CI -3.0 to -1.0). Beta blockers significantly lowered late diastolic blood pressure but not significantly late systolic blood pressure; -5.0/-4.5 mm Hg (95% CI -10.2 to 0.4)/(95% CI -7.8 to -1.15). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and prostacyclin non-significantly reduced late BP as compared to the controls by -5.4/-3.0 mm Hg (95% CI -16.5 to 5.8)/(95% CI -11.1 to 5.0) and -7.4/-3.9 mmHg (95% CI -15.6 to 0.2)/(95% CI -8.1 to 0.4) respectively. Magnesium, naftidrofuryl and piracetam had no significant effect on blood pressure. Oral CCBs and beta blockers each significantly reduced late heart rate (beats per minute (bpm)): CCBs -2.8 bpm (95%CI -3.9 to -1.7); beta blockers -9.3 bpm (95% CI -12.0 to -6.6). Prostacyclin significantly increased late heart rate by +5.6 bpm (95% CI 0.8 to 10.4). None of the drug classes significantly altered outcome apart from beta blockers and streptokinase which increased early case fatality (odds ratio 1.77, 95%CI, 1.05 to 3.00) and 2.27 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.67).",

Patients with hypertensive disease were shown to develop degenerative changes in their erythrocytes, with catecholamine accumulation in them being a prominent feature, these events taking their course against the background of abnormalities in primary parameters characterizing cardiochemodynamics and regulation of the heart's rhythm. The above patients derived apparent benefit from treatment with Renitec, which fact was evidenced by improvement in parameters associated with the cardiochemodynamics and regulation of the cardiac rhythm, by alleviating the degree of severity of degenerative changes in erythrocytes, and by increase in their content of catecholamines.", 
    "737": "Although the renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in increasing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression, the role of the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor is controversial. This report examines the effects of angiotensin peptides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and AT(1) antagonism on rat aortic and cardiac PAI-1 gene expression. In vitro, angiotensin (Ang) I, Ang II, and angiotensin Arg(2)-Phe(8) (Ang III) were potent agonists of PAI-1 mRNA expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs), and stimulation of PAI-1 by these peptides was blocked by the AT(1) antagonist candesartan. Angiotensin Val(3)-Phe(8) (Ang IV) and angiotensin Asp(1)-Pro(7) (Ang [1-7]) did not affect PAI-1 expression in RASMCs. In neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, Ang II increased PAI-1 mRNA expression by 4-fold (P<0.01), and this response was completely blocked by AT(1) receptor antagonism. Continuous intrajugular infusion of Ang II into Sprague-Dawley rats for 3 hours increased aortic and cardiac PAI-1 mRNA expression by 17- and 9 fold, respectively, and these Ang II responses were completely blocked by coinfusion with candesartan. Aortic and cardiac PAI-1 expressions were compared in spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. PAI-1 expression in the aorta and heart from spontaneously hypertensive rats was 5.8-fold and 2-fold higher, respectively, than in control Wistar-Kyoto rats (P<0.05). Candesartan treatment for 1 week reduced aortic and cardiac PAI-1 expression in spontaneously hypertensive rats by 94% and 72%, respectively (P<0.05), but did not affect vascular PAI-1 levels in Wistar-Kyoto rats. These results demonstrate a role for the AT(1) receptor in mediating the effects of Ang II on aortic and cardiac PAI-1 gene expression.", 
    "738": "We have previously reported that the renal kallikrein-kinin system suppressed the development of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension. Kinins were degraded in the kidney mainly by carboxypeptidase Y (CPY)-like kininase. Blockade of renal kinin degradation may reduce hypertension in the developmental stage. We constructed an antisense oligonucleotide against rat CPY homologue (5'-CAT-CTC-TGC-TTC-CTT-GTG-TC-3', AS) and its randomized control oligonucleotide (5'-TCC-TTC-CTG-CTT-GAG-TTC-CT-3', RC), and prepared an HVJ-liposome complex that prolongs and increases the effectiveness of the antisense oligonucleotide. Antisense oligonucleotide was transfected (25 nmole rat(-1), in terms of nucleotide) into the kidney from the renal artery. Blood pressure was measured through a catheter inserted into the abdominal aorta. Mean blood pressure (MBP) in DOCA-salt treated (for 2 weeks) Sprague Dawley strain rats was 130+/-3 mmHg (n=11), and was reduced significantly (P<0.05) more by AS transfection (122+/-4 mmHg, n=6) than by RC treatment (137+/-6 mmHg, n=5) 4 days after the transfection. This reduction in MBP was accompanied by increased urinary sodium excretion (AS, 8.4+/-1.5 mmole day(-1); RC, 4.6+/-0.5 mmole day(-1), P<0.05) and a reduction in urinary CPY-like kininase activity. Ebelactone B (5 mg kg(-1), twice a day, p.o.), an inhibitor for urinary CPY-like kininase, also reduced MBP and induced natriuresis to the same degree as AS. Lisinopril, an inhibitor for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) failed to reduce the elevated MBP. These results suggest that CPY-like kininase may have more contribution than ACE to degrade kinin in the kidney, and that knockdown of CPY-like kininase in the kidney may partly prevent rat DOCA-salt hypertension.", 
    "739": "Hypertension is the most common complication of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and it accelerates the rate of progression of most forms of CRI. Several large clinical trials have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment for prevention of progression of renal failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have therapeutic advantages. However, large scale trials include a variety of chronic renal diseases, and the origins of renal diseases are quite diverse. Moreover, the differences in sex, age, race have not been considered. Based on these trials, it was concluded that blood pressure control is the most effective means for the prevention of deterioration of renal dysfunction. Consistent with this view, our recent preliminary data provide evidence that aggressive blood pressure control using self-reported blood pressure values measured by a home blood pressure device is promising to arrest the progression of renal failure in Japanese patients with CRI.", 
    "740": "The results of clinical studies of the use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in a variety of cardiovascular and renal disorders are reviewed, with emphasis on evidence-based formulary decision-making. In evaluating agents for formulary inclusion, efficacy, safety, dosing, and cost are considered. ACE inhibitors have been investigated in thousands of patients in clinical trials, so an evidence-based approach to their use is appropriate. All ACE inhibitors are effective antihypertensive agents and are generally well tolerated. Thus, in formulary decisions, once-daily dosing and good 24-hour blood pressure control are important considerations to ensure efficacy and patient compliance. ACE inhibitors are key in the prevention and management of heart failure but are underused for these indications. The rationale for use of ACE inhibitors after myocardial infarction is discussed, as is evidence of separate antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors. Evidence for the use of ramipril in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study (HOPE), is reviewed. Clinical trial results provide evidence that some ACE inhibitors have renoprotective and vasculoprotective effects and improve outcomes of patients with a variety of cardiovascular disorders; differences among the ACE inhibitors should be considered in formulary decision-making.", 
    "741": "The use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with heart failure and after myocardial infarction (MI) is discussed, and results of relevant studies are reviewed. In several large trials, the administration of captopril or lisinopril within the first 36 hours after the onset of chest pain due to MI was associated with significant reductions in mortality risk, compared with placebo. Trials evaluating the use of captopril, ramipril, or trandolapril at least three days after the onset of chest pain due to MI also demonstrated significant reductions in mortality risk. Pivotal clinical trials of captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril in the treatment of heart failure are presented. Overall, ACE inhibitor therapy was shown to reduce mortality by decreasing the progression of heart failure. Possible benefits of ACE inhibition in addition to reductions in afterload and preload and preservation of serum potassium are discussed. Certain ACE inhibitors may exert positive effects by modulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, endothelial function, and left ventricular remodeling. If not contraindicated, long-term therapy with captopril, lisinopril, or ramipril should be used in post-MI patients. Patients with heart failure should be treated with one of the ACE inhibitors that have been shown beneficial for this indication.", 
    "742": "Clinical studies evaluating the benefits of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in patients likely to develop renal disease are reviewed. Patients with diabetes or hypertension are at increased risk for development of renal disease. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, captopril therapy was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of death, dialysis, and transplantation and a significantly smaller increase in serum creatinine compared with placebo. Therapy with enalapril or lisinopril has been shown to limit the progression of renal disease in normoalbuminuric patients with diabetes. Long-term therapy with enalapril (up to seven years) has demonstrated the ability to preserve renal function in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria. Over 4.5 years, patients with diabetes and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor had significant reductions in the risk of overt nephropathy with ramipril therapy compared with placebo. In addition, ramipril is associated with preservation of renal function in patients with nondiabetic nephropathy. Evidence suggesting a dissociation of the renal hemodynamic and antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibition is presented. These positive effects of ACE inhibition cannot be explained by reductions in blood pressure alone. ACE inhibitors have renoprotective properties beyond systemic blood pressure reduction.", 
    "743": "Therapeutic goals for the treatment of hypertension and the ability of various angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to meet these goals are presented. The 1997 Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) does not recommend ACE inhibitors for first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension; however, these guidelines do identify compelling indications for ACE inhibitor therapy, including diabetes mellitus (type 1) with proteinuria, heart failure, or previous myocardial infarction with systolic dysfunction. Since the JNC-VI guidelines were developed, the results of a prospective randomized clinical trial in patients with uncomplicated hypertension have demonstrated that ACE inhibitor therapy is as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In hypertensive patients with diabetes, therapy with captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, or ramipril has resulted in significant reductions in cardiovascular events. In addition, tight blood pressure control with an ACE inhibitor has resulted in a greater reduction in the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes than was seen with less tight control. Recent study results support broader use of ACE inhibitors for hypertension than was recommended in the JNC-VI guidelines.", 
    "744": "The pharmacology of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and their role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are described, and pharmacokinetic properties and common adverse events are presented. ACE inhibitors play a vital role in the RAS by regulating the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. All ACE inhibitors share the same basic structure; however, they can be separated on the basis of their functional (binding) group: carboxyl, sulfhydryl, or phosphinyl. These functional groups are, in part, responsible for differences in the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of these agents. Captopril and lisinopril are the only ACE inhibitors that are not prodrugs requiring activation through hepatic biotransformation. Differences among the ACE inhibitors in lipophilicity are described; fosinopril has the greatest lipophilicity and lisinopril the least. ACE is found in numerous tissues, and there is increasing evidence of differences among ACE inhibitors in their ability to inhibit tissue ACE. Most ACE inhibitors are eliminated mainly by the kidneys and to a lesser extent through the liver. Lisinopril is the only ACE inhibitor that does not require hepatic metabolism. In the selection of an ACE inhibitor for once-daily use to treat hypertension, differences in trough-peak ratios are clinically relevant. Fosinopril, ramipril, and trandolapril have minimum trough-peak ratios of 50% or greater. ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated, with hypotension, cough, and hyperkalemia being the most frequently reported adverse effects for the entire class. Drug interactions across the ACE inhibitor class as well as agent-specific interactions are described. Factors to be considered in the selection of an ACE inhibitor include differences in potency, affinity for ACE, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity that are related to structural properties of the drug; whether the trough-peak ratio enables use of a once-daily dose; and potential adverse effects related to a drug's functional (binding) group.", 
    "745": "The usefulness of treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor (ACE-inhibitor) in normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes is controversial.

Estimates of endothelial function obtained were by flow-mediated vasodilation and plasma levels of endothelium-derived proteins.", 
    "747": "As estimated from the measurements on placebo, type 1 diabetic patients, as compared to the controls, had some impairment of endothelial function: plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator levels were lower (3.5 vs. 5.4 ng mL(-1), P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation or plasma levels of von Willebrand Factor, endothelin-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, soluble E-selectin or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. As compared to placebo, ACE-inhibition increased flow-mediated vasodilation in controls (by 3.84% points [95% CI, 0.66 - 7.02], P<0.05), but not in type 1 diabetic patients (0.82% points [95% CI, -2.72 - 4.36], P = 0.64; P = 0.08 vs. controls). On ACE-inhibition soluble E-selectin levels decreased both in controls (from 43.0 to 37.0 ng mL(-1), P<0.01) and in type 1 diabetic patients (from 41.0 to 39.0 ng mL(-1), P = 0.09). Other endothelial markers did not change during ACE-inhibition.",

Short-term ACE-inhibition improves endothelial function as reflected by a decreased sE-selectin in healthy subjects and in normotensive type 1 diabetic patients.

    "749": "In hypercholesterolemia increased lipid and lipoprotein peroxidation occurs. The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in atherogenesis. Angiotensin II induces smooth muscle cells proliferation and stimulates oxidation of LDL particles and foam cell accumulation. Inhibition of ang II production leads to decrease in lipid peroxide production. The aim of this study was to assess the lipid peroxidation expressed as concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) in sera and aorta homogenates after administration of two doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril, enalapril and quinapril) in diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in rabbits. Sixty-four New Zealand rabbits were used. Animals were fed with standard fodder, special diet (1% cholesterol content) or special diet + tested ACEI. Two doses of ACE inhibitors were used: i), equivalent to applied to humans, ii), dose 10 times higher. The animals were divided into 8 groups: control, standard fodder; B, special diet; C1, C2, special diet + captopril in doses 2.5 and 25 mg/kg/24 h, respectively; E1, E2, special diet + enalapril in doses 0.75 and 7.5 mg/kg/24 h, respectively; Q1 and Q2, special diet + quinapril in doses 0.75 and 7.5 mg/kg per day, respectively. In cholesterol-fed rabbits and in groups receiving lower doses of tested ACE inhibitors, the serum TBARS concentration at 6 months was significantly higher in comparison to the control. The higher doses of enalapril, quinapril and captopril, prevented the cholesterol-induced rise in TBARS concentration. Lower dose of captopril attenuated the rise in TBARS concentration, it was significantly lower in comparison to group B, but higher than in the control group. In animals from groups B, E1, C1, Q1 TBARS concentration in aortae was significantly higher as compared to control group. Both doses of captopril and higher doses of enalapril and quinapril inhibited the rise of lipid peroxides concentration induced by cholesterol-rich diet.",

Neutralized quinapril (Q) in the amorphous form, which has a Tg of 51 degrees C, lower than that of its HCl salt (91 degrees C), was significantly more reactive than QHCl at the same temperature. The Tg of lyophilized samples prepared at various initial pH values correlated well with values predicted for mixtures of QHCl and Q. Their different reaction rates were related to their glass transition temperature, consistent with the results from earlier studies obtained with amorphous samples made by precipitation from an organic solution and grinding of the crystal solvate.",

Information was obtained on age, gender, time of onset of symptoms, delay to hospital arrival, mode of transport, and coronary risk factor analysis. The patients were followed up in hospital for analysis of modes of therapy, complications and mortality.", 
    "756": "There were 44 in-hospital deaths among the 433 admissions (10.2%), which is a rate lower than those previously reported from Lebanon. Less than half the patients presented within 6 hours of onset of symptoms and only 28% received thrombolytic therapy. The mortality rate was higher in older age groups, those presenting with cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema, those with a history of angina, infarction or heart failure, and those who developed recurrent ischemia or infarction during their hospital stay. Furthermore, occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, mechanical complications, congestive heart failure and left bundle branch block was associated with a higher mortality rate. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, heparin, nitrates and thrombolytics significantly reduced mortality rates.", 
    "757": "The results reveal improvement in the survival of patients after acute myocardial infarction to values similar to those reported from Western countries. Further effort should be expended to enhance early arrival to the hospital, increased thrombolytic therapy and to implement treatment strategies supported by large clinical trials such as use of aspirin, ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.", 
    "758": "Clinical and experimental data have recently accumulated for antithrombotic action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-1s). We have shown previously that captopril (which contains a thiol group in the moiety) exerts more pronounced antithrombotic activity than does an equipotent dose of enalapril (the drug devoid of the thiol group). To clarify the relative importance of the presence of the thiol group in the molecule versus angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties in the antithrombotic action of captopril, rats were treated with captopril (5 mg/kg twice daily; CAP), epicaptopril (stereoisomer of captopril devoid of ACE-inhibitory properties; 5 mg/kg twice daily; EPI), N-acetylcysteine (3.75 mg/kg twice daily; ACC), enalapril (3 mg/kg once daily; ENA), or distilled water (VEH) for 10 days, per os. After ligation of the vena cava, the incidence of the venous thrombosis and/or the thrombus weight decreased significantly in all but the ENA-treated groups when compared with control rats. The effect of CAP, EPI, and ACC was accompanied by a marked reduction of euglobulin clot lysis time and, with the exception of ACC, by an increase in prothrombin time in the blood collected from the site of the thrombus formation. Antithrombotic activity of EPI was completely abolished by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or indomethacin, with the parallel reversal of fibrinolytic and coagulation parameters toward normal. Activated partial thromboplastin time, mean blood pressure, and bleeding time were not altered by either of the administered drugs. Thus, we demonstrated that thiol compounds exert antithrombotic activity by increasing fibrinolysis and/or suppression of the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade in a nitric oxide/prostacyclin-dependent manner.", 
    "759": "We tested the hypothesis that a combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1-ant) may have an additive cardioprotective effect in mice with heart failure (HF), because these two agents could have other mechanisms of action besides interrupting the renin-angiotensin system. ACEi prevent degradation of bradykinin. During treatment with AT1-ant, increased angiotensin II could activate AT2 receptors, with an antitrophic effect. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model of HF induced by myocardial infarction. Seven days after surgery, mice were divided into six groups and treated for 23 weeks: (a) sham ligation; (b) HF-vehicle; (c) HF-ACEi; (d) HF-AT1-ant; (e) HF-ACEi + AT1-ant (half dose of each); and (f) HF-ACEi + AT1-ant (full dose of each). Cardiac function was evaluated in conscious mice during the treatment period. The HF-vehicle group showed significantly decreased left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), shortening fraction (SF), and cardiac output (CO) and increased LV dimensions, interstitial collagen, and myocyte cross-sectional area (MCSA) compared with controls. Treatment with ACEi or AT1-ant significantly increased EF, SF, and CO and decreased LV dimensions and MCSA in mice with HF. However, a combination of these drugs did not improve cardiac function more than ACEi or AT1-ant alone. We concluded that ACEi and AT1-ant have similar cardioprotective effects and may reach maximal effect when given individually; thus no further improvement can be achieved with combined therapy in mice with HF.", 
    "760": "We investigated the interaction between nitroxy groups and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to assess the role of sulfhydryl groups and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels in vasodilation of human coronary resistance vessels in vitro. Coronary resistance vessels were resected from the right atrial appendage of 27 patients undergoing open heart surgery. The vessel ends were inserted into a microglass pipette with the internal pressure maintained at 40 mm Hg. Nitroglycerin did not change the vasoresponse, whereas nicorandil induced a concentration-dependent vasodilation that was not affected by methylene blue, but was markedly inhibited by glibenclamide. The ACE inhibitors, captopril, with a sulfhydryl group (1 x 10(-6) M), and enalaprilat, without a sulfhydryl group (1 x 10(-6) M), were added to either nitroglycerin or nicorandil to assess the incremental response of the sulfhydryl group to vasodilation. The addition of captopril or L-cysteine (1 x 10(-6) M) enhanced the activity of both nitroglycerin and nicorandil, whereas addition of enalaprilat did not. The responses of nicorandil and nitroglycerin to captopril and were similar. Cromakalim was not enhanced by L-cysteine or captopril. The response of nitroglycerin was not enhanced by captopril or L-cysteine after addition of N(G)-monomethyl-L-ARGININE (L-NMMA). Both nitroglycerin and nicorandil exhibited an increase in vasodilation in the presence of an ACE inhibitor containing a sulfhydryl group. The mechanism of the vasodilatory action in the coronary resistance vessels may involve the opening of an ATP-sensitive potassium channel and subsequent guanylate cyclase activation. These interactions have important clinical implications.", 
    "761": "Recent work from this laboratory demonstrated that apoptosis of pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) in response to Fas requires angiotensin II (ANGII) generation de novo and binding to its receptor (Wang et al., 1999b, Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 277:L1245-L1250). These findings led us to hypothesize that a similar mechanism might be involved in the induction of AEC apoptosis by TNF-alpha. Apoptosis was detected by assessment of nuclear and chromatin morphology, increased activity of caspase 3, binding of annexin V, and by net cell loss inhibitable by the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk. Purified human TNF-alpha induced dose-dependent apoptosis in primary type II pneumocytes isolated from rats or in the AEC-derived human lung carcinoma cell line A549. Apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the nonselective ANGII receptor antagonist saralasin or by the nonthiol ACE inhibitor lisinopril; the inhibition of TNF-induced apoptosis was maximal at 50 microgram/ml saralasin (101% inhibition) and at 0.5 microgram/ml lisinopril (86% inhibition). In both cell culture models, purified TNF-alpha caused a significant increase in the mRNA for angiotensinogen (ANGEN), which was not expressed in unactivated cells. Transfection of primary cultures of rat AEC with antisense oligonucleotides against ANGEN mRNA inhibited the subsequent induction of TNF-stimulated apoptosis by 72% (P < 0.01). Exposure to TNF-alpha increased the concentration of ANGII in the serum-free extracellular medium by fivefold in A549 cell cultures and by 40-fold in primary AEC preparations; further, exposure to TNF-alpha for 40 h caused a net cell loss of 70%, which was completely abrogated by either the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk, lisinopril, or saralasin. Apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha was also completely inhibited by neutralizing antibodies specific for ANGII (P < 0.01), but isotype-matched nonimmune immunoglobulins had no significant effect. These data indicate that the induction of AEC apoptosis by TNF-alpha requires a functional renin/angiotensin system (RAS) in the target cell. They also suggest that therapeutic control of AEC apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha is feasible through pharmacologic manipulation of the local RAS.", 
    "762": "To evaluate the cardiovascular actions of kinins, we established a transgenic rat line harboring the human tissue kallikrein gene, TGR(hKLK1). Under the control of the zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter, the transgene was expressed in most tissues including the heart, kidney, lung, and brain, and human kallikrein was detected in the urine of transgenic animals. Transgenic rats had a lower 24-h mean arterial pressure in comparison with control rats, which was further decreased when their diet was supplemented with zinc. The day/night rhythm of blood pressure was significantly diminished in TGR(hKLK1) animals, whereas the circadian rhythms of heart rate and locomotor activity were unaffected. Induction of cardiac hypertrophy by isoproterenol treatment revealed a marked protective effect of the kallikrein transgene because the cardiac weight of TGR(hKLK1) increased significantly less, and the expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and collagen III as markers for hypertrophy and fibrosis, respectively, were less enhanced. The specific kinin-B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant, abolished this cardioprotective effect. In conclusion, the kallikrein-kinin system is an important determinant in the regulation of blood pressure and its circadian rhythmicity. It also exerts antihypertrophic and antifibrotic actions in the heart.", 
    "763": "Glucose and insulin levels are associated with left ventricular mass (LVM) in insulin-resistant individuals. Antihypertensive drugs have different effects on glucose and insulin metabolism (GIM) and on LVM. To evaluate whether the effects of antihypertensive therapy on LVM are associated with its effects on GIM, we compared the effects of atenolol and perindopril on these parameters in a group of insulin-resistant, obese hypertensives.",

Echocardiographic LVM corrected for height (LVM/height) and GIM (3-hour intravenous glucose tolerance test) were measured after 4 to 6 weeks of washout and 6 months of treatment. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Atenolol and perindopril effectively reduced blood pressure (from 149+/-13/98+/-4 to 127+/-8/82+/-6 mm Hg and from 148+/-9/98+/-4 to 129+/-9/82+/-6 mm Hg, respectively, for the atenolol and perindopril groups; P:=0.002). Atenolol significantly worsened GIM parameters, fasting glucose levels (5.3+/-0.9 to 6.0+/-1.5 mmol/L; P:=0.003), fasting insulin levels (121+/-121 to 189+/-228 pmol/L; P:=0.03), and most other relevant metabolic measures (P:<0.05 for all). Perindopril did not affect GIM. Atenolol did not affect LVM/height (119+/-12 to 120+/-17 g/m; P:=0.8), whereas perindopril significantly reduced LVM/height (120+/-13 to 111+/-19 g/m; P:=0.04).", 
    "765": "In obese, hypertensive individuals, adequate and similar blood pressure control was achieved with perindopril and atenolol. However, perindopril but not atenolol was associated with a more favorable GIM profile and led to a significant regression of LVM.",

    "767": "There were a total of 460 patients: 230 received simvastatin and 230, a simvastatin placebo, and 229 received enalapril and 231, an enalapril placebo (some subjects received both drugs and some received a double placebo). Mean baseline measurements were as follows: cholesterol level, 5.20 mmol/L; triglyceride level, 1.82 mmol/L; HDL, 0.99 mmol/L; and LDL, 3.36 mmol/L. Average follow-up was 47.8 months. Changes in quantitative coronary angiographic measures between simvastatin and placebo, respectively, were as follows: mean diameters, -0.07 versus -0.14 mm (P:=0.004); minimum diameters, -0.09 versus -0.16 mm (P:=0. 0001); and percent diameter stenosis, 1.67% versus 3.83% (P:=0.0003). These benefits were not observed in patients on enalapril when compared with placebo. No additional benefits were seen in the group receiving both drugs. Simvastatin patients had less need for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (8 versus 21 events; P:=0.020), and fewer enalapril patients experienced the combined end point of death/myocardial infarction/stroke (16 versus 30; P:=0.043) than their respective placebo patients.", 
    "768": "This trial extends the observation of the beneficial angiographic effects of lipid-lowering therapy to normocholesterolemic patients. The implications of the neutral angiographic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition are uncertain, but they deserve further investigation in light of the positive clinical benefits suggested here and seen elsewhere.", 
    "769": "In the present study we sought to determine the effect of age, hypertension and endogenous angiotensin on the chronotropic responses to vagal stimulation in urethane anesthetized-normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). After beta-adrenoceptor blockade with atenolol, the right and left vagal nerves were stimulated with graded frequencies between 1 and 32 Hz in 5-, 8- and 22-week-old animals. At all ages and in both strains, there was a strong linear relationship between the degree of bradycardia and the log of the stimulation frequency. At the age of 5 weeks, the bradycardia to stimulation of the right vagus was greater in SHR than that observed in WKY (P<0.05). However, in 8- and 22 week-old animals, no differences were observed between the response to vagal stimulation in WKY and SHR. Thus, there was an age-dependent increase in the response to right vagal stimulation in WKY, but no such trend in SHR. No significant age-dependent changes in left vagal responses were observed in either strain. Left vagal responses were approximately half of the response to right vagal stimulation at all ages in SHR and in 8-22 week WKY, but similar to right vagal responses in 5 week WKY. Administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril, which effectively blocked the formation of endogenous angiotensin, did not affect responses to vagal stimulation at any age, in either strain. These results suggest that the baroreflex vagal deficit observed in adult SHR compared to WKY is not due to a difference in the responsiveness of the cardiac vagal neuroeffector mechanism nor due to an effect of circulating angiotensin II. Furthermore, the enhanced vagal bradycardia observed in very young SHR which was due primarily to the earlier establishment of the adult vagal response pattern may indicate accelerated vagal development in this strain compared to WKY.", 
    "770": "Atherosclerotic renal vascular disease can impair kidney perfusion and lead to deterioration of kidney function. The mechanisms by which reversible tissue injury becomes irreversible are not yet certain, although multiple pathways for activation of inflammatory cytokines and tissue fibrosis have been identified. The clinical hallmark of this disorder is loss of glomerular filtration beyond renal artery stenosis affecting the entire renal mass, usually associated with progressive hypertension and fluid retention. Some investigators believe that 12% to 18% of patients reaching end-stage renal disease in western countries may have lost kidney function because of azotemic renovascular disease. This is an important disorder to identify, because reduction of arterial pressure from antihypertensive therapy may further reduce kidney perfusion. Although administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists lead to functional loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) beyond a stenotic lesion because of the removal of efferent actions of angiotensin II, other antihypertensive agents reduce renal perfusion also. Restoration of renal blood flow by surgical or endovascular methods can prevent progressive disease and sometimes improves renal function. However, clinical series commonly indicate that some patients lose further kidney function after revascularization. This may be explained partly by undetected renal atheremboli or other toxicity related to vascular repair. Hence, selection of patients for renal revascularization requires careful consideration of comorbid disease risk and the balance of risks and benefits regarding progressive renal disease. Searching for better methods of identifying those individuals at risk for irreversible loss of renal function and who might benefit from vascular repair is a high research priority.", 
    "771": "This prospective multicenter study included 1,205 patients, who were referred for difficult-to-treat hypertension or analysis of possible secondary hypertension. After a standardized selection protocol based on sharply defined drug-resistant hypertension or renal function impairment during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, patients underwent renal scintigraphy and a captopril-renin challenge test. A set of clinical characteristics was also recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of renal scintigraphy for diagnosing renal artery stenosis were 0.72 and 0.90 and of the captopril-renin test 0.77 to 0.91 and 0.69 to 0.75 depending on the criterion used. The clinical characteristics were used to construct a clinical prediction rule for renal artery stenosis, which had a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.87 at a cut-off level of 30% predicted probability. However, with the prediction rule a sensitivity of 0.90 could be reached by performing arteriography only in patients with a predicted probability of stenosis of > or =10%, resulting in a considerable reduction of the number of arteriograms to be made. A diagnostic strategy is advocated starting with drug-resistant hypertension and continuing to renal arteriography only in patients with increased probability of stenosis. Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis were then randomized to balloon angioplasty (n = 56) versus antihypertensive medication (n = 50). Three months after randomization 22 patients from the medication group underwent balloon angioplasty in second instance. In an intention-to-treat analysis, no difference in blood pressure was found between the groups after 3 months, nor after 12 months of follow-up, although there was a small medication-sparing effect of balloon angioplasty. The lack of a beneficial effect of balloon angioplasty compared with medication could not be attributed to the high stenosis recurrence rate after angioplasty, nor to the fact that the inclusion criterion was set at a stenosis level of > or =50% so that patients with relatively mild stenosis were also included. Renal function after angioplasty was slightly better in the angioplasty group than in the medication group, and improvement of the renal scintigram occurred more often after angioplasty. Apart from the treatment of patients with specific characteristics, the presented therapeutic approach starts with extending the antihypertensive drug therapy to control blood pressure. Only if blood pressure cannot be controlled or if renal function deteriorates, balloon angioplasty (with stent placement) is indicated.", 
    "772": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) renography is the only imaging examination that tests directly for the presence of renovascular hypertension (RVH); other imaging examinations test only for the presence of renal artery stenosis (RAS). Consensus panels have recommended that ACEI renograms be interpreted as low, intermediate, or high probability for RVH. ACEI renography is highly accurate in patients with normal renal function and suspected RVH. In this patient population, the sensitivity and specificity of ACEI renography for RAS are approximately 90%; as an initial approach, angiography is not cost effective. Data from 10 studies evaluating cure or improvement in blood pressure in 291 patients undergoing revascularization showed the mean positive predictive value of ACEI renography to be 92%. When azotemic patients present with suspected RVH, as many as 50% of patients may have an intermediate probability ACEI renogram and the sensitivity of detecting RVH falls to approximately 80% even when intermediate and high probability tests are combined.", 
    "773": "Static tests of plasma renin activity (PRA) or renal vein renins, even when assessed in relationship to dietary salt intake by renin-sodium profiling, are insufficiently sensitive for reliable screening for renovascular hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) stimulate PRA selectively in patients with renovascular hypertension. In large series, the captopril-stimulated PRA test has a high sensitivity in excess of 90% where it is validated against a functional response of an improvement or cure in blood pressure after an intervention to correct renal artery stenosis. However, there are wide variations in the reported accuracy of this test between studies. In part, this may reflect an inappropriate use of a functional test to screen for an anatomical abnormality of renal artery stenosis. Both ACEI-stimulated PRA and ACEI-induced changes in the renogram likely reflect a similar fundamental abnormality in the poststenotic kidney: a selective reduction in the postglomerular vascular resistance leading to a sharp fall in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This fall in GFR is manifest as a delay in tubular transit of renogram tracers, leading to an abnormal ACEI renogram, and to a reduction in macula densa NaCl delivery, leading to an abnormal ACEI renogram, and to a reduction in macula densa NaCl delivery, leading to an exaggerated rise in PRA. Under protocol conditions, both the ACEI-PRA and the ACEI-renogram tests have sensitivities for the detection of functional renovascular hypertension of greater than 90%.", 
    "774": "Renovascular disease appears to be increasing in prevalence, particularly in older subjects with atherosclerotic disease elsewhere. Its clinical manifestations and presentation are changing because of rapid advances in medical therapy and other comorbid events. Although fibromuscular dysplasia and other diseases affecting the renal artery can produce the syndrome of renovascular hypertension, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common clinical entity. It can produce a spectrum of manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic (\"incidental\"), identified during angiographic evaluation of other conditions, to progressive hypertension to accelerated cardiovascular disease with pulmonary edema and advanced renal failure. With the widespread application of drugs which block the renin-angiotensin system, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists, many cases of renovascular hypertension remain unsuspected and never produce adverse effects. Clinicians need to be alert to the potential for disease progression, with the potential for total renal artery occlusion and/or loss of viable renal tissue. Selection of patients for renal revascularization depends on individual balance of risks and benefits regarding the likely outcomes regarding both improvements in blood pressure control and preservation of renal function.", 
    "775": "The kidneys play a central role in the long-term control of arterial pressure by regulating sodium balance and extracellular fluid volume. The renin-angiotensin system is important in the regulation of the arterial pressure through its chronic effects on the pressure natriuresis relationship. Under physiologic conditions, angiotensin II (Ang II) is important in causing the long-term relationship between arterial pressure and sodium excretion to be very steep, so that minimal changes in arterial pressure are necessary to maintain sodium balance in response to variations in sodium intake. An inability to suppress Ang II formation in response to increases in sodium intake can lead to salt-sensitive hypertension. Excess formation of Ang II, such as in renovascular hypertension, causes the pressure natriuresis relationship to be shifted to higher arterial pressures so that higher arterial pressures are necessary to maintain sodium balance. Ang II decreases pressure natriuresis by enhancing tubular reabsorption and/or reducing glomerular filtration. Because Ang II does not decrease glomerular filtration in most circumstances, the sodium retaining actions of Ang II are usually caused by increased tubular reabsorption. However, there are a number of pathophysiologic conditions where Ang II interacts with various local autocrine and paracrine factors (such as nitric oxide [NO], eicosanoids, adenosine, and superoxide) to influence glomerular filtration rate. Ang II enhances tubular reabsorption either indirectly, through aldosterone stimulation, via alterations in renal hemodynamics (physical factors or medullary blood flow), or by directly enhancing tubular sodium transport. Converting enzyme inhibitors or Ang II receptor antagonists improve pressure natriuresis and are very effective in the treatment of various forms of hypertension associated with normal or enhanced activity of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "776": "A considerable amount of data have implicated angiotensin receptors (AT receptors) in the development and maintenance of essential hypertension and renovascular hypertension as well as in progressive renal pathologies. Inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II) action by blocking Ang II formation through angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or by blocking AT1 receptors directly using subtype-selective nonpeptide antagonists, has been found to attenuate the proteinuria, microalbuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, and nephrosclerosis in a variety of experimental models and in clinical trials. This review will first broadly discuss AT receptor subtypes in terms of their structure, function, tissue distribution and signaling. Secondly, the mechanistic differences between ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade will be examined because these pharmaceutical agents are widely used tools to investigate the role of AT receptors in renal disease. Lastly, experimental models of essential hypertension, renovascular hypertension and progressive renal disease will be presented, which include the Fawn-hooded rat, the stroke prone spontaneously hypertensive rat, renal mass ablation and the 2K1C and 1K1C animal models. The overall goal of this review is to critically evaluate the data regarding the role of AT receptors in the pathophysiology of renal disease.",

The ACE inhibitors were given in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Co and Ci were used in the morning. Melatonin was given at 10.00 p.m. 10-14 days before and after therapy, 24-hour monitoring (Astracard, Russia) and echocardiography (Toshiba, Japan) were performed. Analyzing the findings indicated the time-dependent hemodynamic effects of R, E, and C-50. Ci, A, and Co were found to have antihypertensive and vasodilatory effects without normalizing the chronostructure of circadian rhythms of major hemodynamic parameters. By producing antihypertensive and vasodilatory effects, melatonin leads to the recovery of circadian hemodynamic organization when used alone and in combination with Co, Ci, and ACE inhibitors.",

We used a randomized trial including 18 hospitals nested within the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project. Patients comprised AMI Medicare patients admitted before (n = 929, 1994 and 1995) and after intervention (n = 438, 1996). Control hospitals received written feedback by mail. The experimental intervention group received a presentation led by a cardiologist and a quality improvement specialist. We assessed the proportion of patients receiving appropriate AMI care before and after the intervention. Both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated no effect of the intervention in increasing the proportion of patients who received reperfusion, aspirin, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. On-site feedback presentations were not associated with a larger improvement in AMI care compared to the mailed feedback. Other interventions, such as opinion leaders and patient-directed interventions, may be necessary in order to improve the care of AMI patients.",

Secondary analyses showed significantly greater efficacy with telmisartan 80 mg than with valsartan 80 mg, including greater mean reductions from baseline of ABPM (systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure) during the daytime (06:00 to 21:59) and morning (06:00 to11:59) hours, and larger decreases in trough cuff blood pressure (P<0.01).

These results may be due to telmisartan's longer plasma half-life or to a higher potency compared with valsartan, such that a higher dose of valsartan may produce effects similar to those of 80 mg telmisartan. These data confirm the long duration of action of telmisartan with consistent and sustained control of blood pressure over 24 h and during the last 6 h of the dosing interval.

The use and recent impact of these and other therapies on the broader, community-wide population of patients with Q-AMI is less well established. Residents of the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area (1990 census population 437,000) hospitalized with confirmed Q-AMI in all metropolitan Worcester, Massachusetts, hospitals in 4 1-year periods between 1986 and 1997 comprised the sample of interest. We examined the rates of occurrence, use of reperfusion strategies, and hospital mortality in a cohort of 711 patients with Q-AMI treated early in the reperfusion era (1986 and 1988) in comparison to 669 patients with Q-AMI treated a decade later (1995 and 1997). The percentage of Q-AMI among all hospitalized patients with AMI decreased over the decade of reperfusion therapy: 52% in 1986 and 1988 versus 35% in 1995 and 1997 (p < 0.001). Use of reperfusion therapy for patients with Q-AMI increased from 22% to 57%, with a marked increase in the use of primary angioplasty over time (1% vs 16%). The profile of patients receiving reperfusion therapy also changed significantly over the study period. Marked increases in use of antiplatelet therapy, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and decreased use of calcium channel blockers, were observed over time. The crude in-hospital case fatality rate declined from 19% (1986 and 1988) to 14% (1995 and 1997) in patients with Q-AMI. Results of a multivariable regression analysis showed lack of reperfusion therapy, older age, anterior wall AMI, and cardiogenic shock to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with Q-AMI. Thus, the percentage of all AMI's presenting as Q-AMI, and hospital mortality after Q-AMI, has decreased significantly in the past 10 years.

This was reduced to -6.37 +/- 0.24 with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, to -6.33 +/- 0.19 with the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon and to -7.3 +/- 0.20 with captopril and phosphoramidon combined. 4. The permeability response to bradykinin was blocked by the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE 140, by inhibition of the Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2, by the scavenging of free radicals, or by inhibition of both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase in combination. Block of Ca2+ entry channels with SKF 96365 had no effect on the response. 5. Application of [des-Arg9]-bradykinin also increased permeability over the concentration range 5 nM to 50 microM, with a logEC50 of -5.6 +/- 0. 37. This response was not affected by free radical scavenging, but was completely blocked by the histamine H2 receptor blocker cimetidine. 6. These results imply that the acute permeability response to bradykinin is mediated via the release of arachidonic acid, which is acted on by cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase resulting in the formation of free radicals, and that the response to [des-Arg9]-bradykinin is mediated via histamine.", 
    "809": "The inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACEI) are considered as the best pharmacological class for the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy. Independently of lowering the arterial blood pressure they reduce the proteinuria and slow the evolution of the renal failure. Calcium-channels blockers not belonging to the dehydropyridine-type (verapamil-diltiazem) possess some of these features, too, contrarily to the rest of calcium-antagonists (nifedipine-like). Two clinical studies dealing with type-II diabetic-patients whose nephropathy was complicated by a nephrotic syndrome and a rapid progressive renal failure showed that the combination of verapamil with an ACEI, further dietetic measures (protein restriction, saltless diet), permitted a significant decrement of the proteinuria as well as a stabilisation of the kidney function. This effect could not be shown under treatment with only ACEI. Thus the proteinuria-inhibiting and kidney-protecting effects of the combination of theses two substances-groups should be known when the physician is confronted at this clinical situation that determines the prognostic of the kidney function in such a dramatic way and short laps of time.", 
    "810": "Despite much effort over recent years to design and develop endothelin-receptor antagonists, these compounds are far from becoming new drug entities. This article will review preclinical data on select endothelin-receptor antagonists as well as clinical data on bosentan, the only molecule currently in Phase III clinical trials. Though efficacious, bosentan is less potent than the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, in patients with hypertension. We will therefore discuss the possible reason(s) for this low potency, the consequences thereof, and a few therapeutic areas where endothelin-receptor antagonists could find better use.", 
    "811": "Endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP 24.15) is a thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase which is expressed widely throughout the body, with the highest concentrations in the brain, pituitary and testis. While the precise role of EP 24.15 remains unknown, it is thought to participate in the regulated metabolism of a number of specific neuropeptides. Of the limited number of inhibitors described for EP 24.15, N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Tyr-p-amino benzoate (CFP) is the most widely studied. CFP is a potent and specific inhibitor, but is unstable in vivo due to its cleavage between the alanine and tyrosine residues by the enzyme neprilysin (EP 24.11). The cpp-Ala-Ala N-terminal product of this cleavage is a potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, which further limits the use of CFP in vivo. To generate specific inhibitors of EP 24.15 that are resistant to in vivo proteolysis by EP 24.11, beta-amino acids have been incorporated into the structure of CFP. We have prepared racemic mixtures of beta-amino acids containing proteogenic side chains, which are 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected, and several analogues of CFP containing beta-amino acids have been synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis. The results of stability and inhibitory studies of these new analogues show that the incorporation of beta-amino acids adjacent to the scissile bond can indeed stabilize the peptides against cleavage by EP 24.11 and still inhibit EP 24.15. The results obtained in these studies demonstrate the potential of these amino acids in the synthesis of peptidomimetics and in the design of new stable and specific therapeutics."
