While several physiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain this association, decreased receipt of guidelines-based care may also contribute. We examined the relationship between admission haemoglobin (Hgb) level, receipt of ACC/AHA guidelines-based treatments, and in-hospital outcomes among STEMI patients. We also evaluated whether administration of these treatments modified the association between anaemia and in-hospital mortality in this group.",

Anaemia was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of other baseline comorbidities and decreased odds of receiving several class I recommended pharmacological treatments (heparin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, p<0.01). The overall use of reperfusion therapy (fibrinolytic therapy and/or percutaneous coronary intervention) was also lower in anaemic vs. non-anaemic patients (p<0.01).

Women were less likely to undergo primary reperfusion treatment after adjustment for baseline characteristics and admission year (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.90, p<0.001) or receive early and discharge drugs, such as thienopyridines, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and statins. In 1997, thrombolysis was performed in 51% of male and 39% of female patients; its use rapidly decreased during the 1990s and has now become negligible. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention increased from under 10% in both genders in 1997 to over 70% in females and over 80% in males since 2006. Patients admitted in cardiogenic shock increased by 8% per year in both genders. The incidence of both reinfarction and cardiogenic shock developing during hospitalization decreased significantly over 15 years while in-hospital mortality decreased from 10 to 5% in men and from 18 to 7% in women. This corresponds to a relative reduction of 5% per year for males (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p=0.006) and 6% per year for female STEMI patients (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97, p<0.001).

CHM was tested to be more effective in reducing urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) (MD -82.95\u2009 \u03bc g/min, [-138.64, -27.26]) and proteinuria (MD -565.99\u2009mg/24\u2009h, [-892.41, -239.57]) compared with placebo. CHM had a greater beneficial effect on reduction of UAER (MD -13.41\u2009 \u03bc g/min, [-20.63, -6.19]) and proteinuria (MD -87.48\u2009mg/24\u2009h, [-142.90, -32.06]) compared with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Combination therapy with CHM and ACEI/ARB showed significant improvement in UAER (MD -28.18\u2009 \u03bc g/min, [-44.4, -11.97]), urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (MD -347.00, [-410.61, -283.39]), protein-creatinine ratio (MD -2.49, [-4.02, -0.96]), and proteinuria (MD -26.60\u2009mg/24\u2009h, [-26.73, -26.47]) compared with ACEI/ARB alone. No serious adverse events were reported. CHM seems to be an effective and safe therapy option to treat proteinuric patients with DN, suggesting that further study of CHM in the treatment of DN is warranted in rigorously designed, multicentre, large-scale trials with higher quality worldwide.", 
    "9": "The juxtaglomerular areas of mammalian kidneys express the gap junction proteins connexin 37, 40, 43, and 45. Among these, Cx40 plays a major role for the function of juxtaglomerular renin-expressing cells, while Cx37 and Cx45 appear to be less relevant in this context. Since the role of the remaining Cx43 for the function of renin expression is not well understood, this study aimed to systematically characterize the direct role of Cx43 for renin expression and secretion. For this aim, we generated mice with endothelium and with renin cell-specific deletions of Cx43, and we characterized the regulation of renin expression and renin secretion in the kidneys of these mice on normal salt diet and during chronic challenge of the renin system by pretreatment of mice with a low-salt diet in combination with an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor. We found that renal renin mRNA abundance, plasma renin concentration, and systolic blood pressure did not differ between wild-type, Cx43(fl/fl) Ren1d(+/Cre) mice as well as Cx43(fl/fl) Tie-2(+/Cre) mice under basal conditions nor under chronic stimulation by salt depletion. The localization of renin-expressing cells was also regular in kidneys of all genotypes, and moreover, regulation of renin secretion by beta-adrenergic stimulation and renal perfusion pressure measured in isolated perfused kidneys of Cx43(fl/fl) Ren1d(+/Cre) and Cx43(fl/fl) Tie-2(+/Cre) mice was not different from control. We infer from these results that Cx43 plays if at all only a minor role for the functional control of renin-producing cells in the kidney.",

Combining different descriptor sets generally leads to better modeling performance than utilizing individual sets. The best performers were Z-scales (3) combined with ProtFP (Feature), or Z-Scales (3) combined with an average Z-Scale value for each target, while ProtFP (PCA8), ST-Scales, and ProtFP (Feature) rank last.",

METHODS 70 spontaneous hypertensive rats of 8-week age, 200-gram weight were separated into 7 groups, as hypertension, ramipril, telmisartan, eplerenone, ramipril + telmisartan, telmisartan + eplerenone, and ramipril+eplerenone treatment group. Another 10 healthy Wistar rats of the same age and weight were used as control group. All the rats were given intragastric administration at 8 a. m. every morning, and measured arteria caudilis pressure at 0, 4 and 8 week, respectively. 8 weeks later, all the rats were sacrificed, and the hearts were taken to measure the weight of left ventricle and the ratio of left ventricle to body weight. Myocardial fibrosis was observed by H&E staining of paraffin embedded sections, and Cx43 expression was examined by RT-PCR and western blot.",

    "29": "Decrease in endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was reported to participate in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study is aimed at exploring the relationship between the abnormalities in H2S metabolism, hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and the activation of intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Cultured renal mesangial cells (MCs) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats were used for the studies. The expressions of angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II) type I receptor (AT1), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and collagen IV were measured by real time PCR and Western blot. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by fluorescent probe assays. Cell proliferation was analyzed by 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay. Ang II concentration was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. AGT, ACE and AT1 receptor mRNA levels and Ang II concentration were increased in high glucose (HG) -treated MCs, the cell proliferation rate and the production of TGF-\u03b21 and of collagen IV productions were also increased. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylenechloride iodonium (DPI) was able to reverse the HG-induced RAS activation and the changes in cell proliferation and collagen synthesis. Supplementation of H2S attenuated HG-induced elevations in ROS and RAS activation. Blockade on H2S biosynthesis from cystathione-\u03b3-lyase (CSE) by DL-propargylglycine (PPG) resulted in effects similar to that of HG treatment. In STZ-induced diabetic rats, the changes in RAS were also reversed by H2S supplementation without affecting blood glucose concentration. These data suggested that the decrease in H2S under hyperglycemic condition leads to an imbalance between oxidative and reductive species. The increased oxidative species results in intrarenal RAS activation, which, in turn, contributes to the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction.", 
    "30": "The development of resistance to virtually all current antibiotics makes the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds with novel protein targets an urgent challenge. The dapE-encoded N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE) is an essential metallo-enzyme for growth and proliferation in many bacteria, acting in the desuccinylation of N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid (SDAP) in a late stage of the anabolic pathway towards both lysine and a crucial building block of the peptidoglycan cell wall. L-Captopril, which has been shown to exhibit very promising inhibitory activity in vitro against DapE and has attractive drug-like properties, nevertheless does not target DapE in bacteria effectively. Here we show that L-captopril targets only the Zn(2+)-metallo-isoform of the enzyme, whereas the Mn(2+)-enzyme, which is also a physiologically relevant isoform in bacteria, is not inhibited. Our finding provides a rationale for the failure of this promising lead-compound to exhibit any significant antibiotic activity in bacteria and underlines the importance of addressing metallo-isoform heterogeneity in future drug design. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first example of metallo-isoform heterogeneity in vivo that provides an evolutionary advantage to bacteria upon drug-challenge.",

Thyme honey and chestnut honey possess the highest antioxidant capacity, which is due to their high vitamin C (in thyme honey) and total polyphenolic content (in chestnut honey). On the other hand, chestnut honey showed high antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, whilst others had no activity against S. aureus and showed very small activity against E. coli. Moreover it was found that the antimicrobial activity measured in chestnut honey was partly due to its lysozyme content. In addition the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was measured, and the ACE inhibition is one mechanism by which antihypertensive activity is exerted in vivo. All the types of honey showed some activity but chestnut honey had the highest ACE inhibitory activity.",

CL emission wavelengths and UV-vis spectra were used to characterize the system and propose a possible mechanism. Furthermore, it was found that captopril inhibits the action of NPs and decreases the intensity of CL. Based on this phenomenon, a new CL method was developed for the determination of captopril in the 3.0 \u00d7 10(-10) to 1.0 \u00d7 10(-7) mol L(-1) concentration range with a detection limit (3s) of 0.12 nmol L(-1).

Finally, two peptides responsible for ACE inhibitory activity were identified to be MVGSAPGVL (829Da) and LGPLGHQ (720Da), with IC50 values of 3.09 and 4.22\u03bcM, respectively. Moreover, the free radical-scavenging activity of the purified peptides was determined in human endothelial cells. In addition, the antioxidative mechanism of the purified peptides was evaluated by protein and gene expression levels of antioxidant enzymes.

Initially, she was treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers which maintained her protein excretion below nephrotic range for two years. Her nephrotic syndrome then relapsed and was treated with steroids and chlorambucil, according to the Ponticelli protocol. A few months later, she presented with early morning joint stiffness, polyarthritis involving the small joints of the hands, and strongly positive rheumatoid factor, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Her serum creatinine remained normal and a second renal biopsy revealed the same features of MN.

Symptoms were recorded in 28.8% of cases, already occurred in mild forms, and comprised gait impairment (45%, including falls), confusion (30%), sedation (26%), and dyspepsia (41%). Age, female sex, nonpsychiatric drug polypharmacy-particularly with thiazides and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors-and diagnosis of a mood disorder were associated with more severe hyponatremia, respectively. The proportion of hyponatremic patients treated with venlafaxine, trazodone, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and first-generation antipsychotics, respectively, was significantly higher in the hyponatremia sample than in the normonatremic population. This was, surprisingly, not the case with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or any other antidepressant drug class. We found prescription with second-generation antipsychotics to be significantly associated with less severe hyponatremia.Hyponatremia may be mainly attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, as indicated by decreased serum osmolarity in our sample.

After 14 weeks' treatment, telmisartan had a greater systolic BP (SBP) reduction and higher smoothness index in all four dipper groups compared with ramipril. In addition, the tendency toward dipping was significantly higher in patients treated with) telmisartan than ramipril (P=0.032; odds ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril: 1.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.102-1.58)). In patients with an early morning SBP surge \ue2f635\u2009mm\u2009Hg, telmisartan treatment was associated with significantly greater reductions from baseline in the night-time low mean, early morning mean and early morning SBP surge compared with ramipril (P=0.026, P<0.0001 and P=0.0006, respectively). In this retrospective analysis, telmisartan was shown to normalize the circadian BP pattern to a dipper profile in a larger proportion of patients than ramipril, and reduce early-morning SBP surge in high-risk patients, indicative of a cardioprotective effect. These findings need to be confirmed in long-term prospective trials and observational studies.",

To this end, previous recommendations included a BP target of <130/80 mm Hg for all individuals with CKD (and possibly <125/75 mm\u2009Hg for those with proteinuria >1 g/day), as well as use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension in all CKD patients. However, long-term extensions of relevant clinical trials support a low-BP goal only for patients with proteinuria, whereas recent cardiovascular trials questioned the benefits of low systolic BP for diabetic patients, leading to more individualized recommendations. Furthermore, our previous knowledge of the specific renoprotective properties of RAAS blockers in patients with proteinuric CKD is now extended with data on the use of these agents in patients with less advanced nephropathy and/or absence of proteinuria, deriving mostly from subanalyses of cardiovascular trials. This review discusses previous and recent clinical evidence on the issues of BP reduction and RAAS blockade by type and stage of renal damage, aiming to aid clinicians in their treatment decisions for patients with CKD.",

Our data suggest that spironolactone, metoprolol and perindopril prevent not only the STZ-induced metabolic abnormalities but also cardiovascular complications as evident from the reduction in cholesterol, triglyceride and decrease in cardiac hypertrophy which are the initial symptoms of congestive heart failure.

In our study, we used rabbits fed with high-fat forage, as an atherosclerosis model to investigate the effect of fosinopril, which is an ACEI. Animals which received both high-fat forage and fosinopril, were maintained as the drug-treated group. Ultrasonography and Sudan III staining were used to determine the process of atherosclerosis. The expression of TLR4 and activity NF-\u03baB were determined using western blot, RT-PCR and ELISA. The results showed that the atherosclerotic plaque was visible at sixteen weeks. More importantly, the atherosclerotic plaque was significantly decreased after fosinopril treatment. In the atherosclerosis model, the levels of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB were increased, but this increased expression was inhibited in the fosinopril treated group. Our results demonstrated that TLR4 could be used as a potential biomarker for atherosclerosis and ACEI has the potential to be a new anti-atherosclerotic drug.",

Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into five groups: control, nicotine, diabetic, Diab\u00a0+\u00a0Nico, and Diab\u00a0+\u00a0Nico\u00a0+\u00a0Enal. Animals were made diabetic by single injection of streptozotocin (55\u00a0mg/kg/intraperitoneally). Nicotine dissolved in drinking water at a concentration of 100\u00a0\u00b5g/ml was given ad libitum and enalapril was given orally at a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg/day for four consecutive weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, animals were killed and biochemical parameters glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, cotinine, and the testosterone levels were measured. Testicular toxicity was evaluated using sperm count, sperm comet assay, histology, and immunohistochemical staining of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) and the proinflammatory markers (nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), and tissue necrotic factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)) evaluated by western blotting. Results showed that nicotine did not alter the blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin level, significantly decreased the sperm count and increased the sperm DNA damage. These changes were accompanied by significant increases in the 8-oxo-dG, NF-\u03baB, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1 expression. Furthermore, the intervention of enalapril in nicotine-treated diabetic rat attenuated the testicular damage and restored sperm count, sperm DNA damage, as well as reduced the expression of NF-\u03baB, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1. These findings clearly suggest that nicotine not only augmented the testicular toxicity in the diabetic rat but also increases the risk of germ cell toxicity effects that were attenuated by enalapril treatment.",

The discarded, distal end section of IMA was carefully removed, and the vasoreactivity of IMA rings was evaluated in vitro using an organ chamber. Smooth muscle contractile function was tested on artery segments exposed to 10-80 mM KCl and norepinephrine.

    "73": "Hypertension during preeclampsia is associated with increased maternal vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II (ANGII). This study was designed to determine mechanisms whereby agonistic autoantibodies to the ANGII type I receptor (AT1-AA) enhance blood pressure (mean arterial pressure [MAP]) and renal vascular sensitivity to ANGII during pregnancy. First, we examined MAP and renal artery resistance index in response to chronic administration of ANGII or AT1-AA or AT1-AA+ANGII in pregnant rats compared with control pregnant rats. To examine mechanisms of heightened sensitivity in response to AT1-AA during pregnancy, we examined the role of endogenous ANGII in AT1-AA-infused pregnant rats, and that of endothelin-1 and oxidative stress in AT1-AA+ANGII-treated rats. Chronic ANGII increased MAP from 95\u00b12 in normal pregnant rats to 115\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg; chronic AT1-AA increased MAP to 118\u00b11 mm\u2009Hg in normal pregnant rats, which further increased to 123\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg with AT1-AA+ANGII. Increasing ANGII from 10(-11) to 10(-8) decreased afferent arteriole diameter from 15% to 20% but sharply decreased afferent arteriole diameter to 60% in AT1-AA-pretreated vessels. Renal artery resistance index increased from 0.67 in normal pregnant rats to 0.70 with AT1-AA infusion, which was exacerbated to 0.74 in AT1-AA+ANGII-infused rats. AT1-AA-induced hypertension decreased with enalapril but was not attenuated. Both tissue endothelin-1 and reactive oxygen species increased with AT1-AA+ANGII compared with AT1-AA alone, and blockade of either of these pathways had significant effects on MAP or renal artery resistance index. These data support the hypothesis that AT1-AA, via activation of endothelin-1 and oxidative stress and interaction with endogenous ANGII, is an important mechanism whereby MAP and renal vascular responses are enhanced during preeclampsia.", 
    "74": "Angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R)-mediated vasodilation has been demonstrated in different vascular beds in vitro and in perfused organs. In vivo studies, however, consistently failed to disclose renal vasodilator responses to compound 21, a selective AT2R agonist, even after angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade. Here, we investigated in vivo whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, reducing endogenous angiotensin II levels, could unmask the effects of selective AT2R stimulation on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics in normotensive and hypertensive rats. After pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, intravenous administration of compound 21 did not affect blood pressure and induced dose-dependent renal vasodilator responses in spontaneously hypertensive but not in normotensive rats. The D1 receptor agonist fenoldopam, used as positive control, reduced blood pressure and renal vascular resistance in both strains. The AT2R antagonist PD123319 and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NMMA (N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine acetate) abolished the renal vasodilator response to compound 21 without affecting responses to fenoldopam. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin partially inhibited the renal vascular response to compound 21, whereas the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant was without effect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition unmasked a renal vasodilator response to selective AT2R stimulation in vivo, mediated by nitric oxide and partially by prostaglandins. AT2R may have a pathophysiological role to modulate renal hemodynamic effects of angiotensin II in the hypertensive state.",

In the present study, we investigated the influence of the pressor response elicited by noradrenaline injected into the LPBN on FURO+CAP-induced water and 1.8% NaCl intake. Male Holtzman rats with bilateral stainless steel guide-cannulas implanted into LPBN were used. Bilateral injections of noradrenaline (40 nmol/0.2 \u03bcl) into the LPBN increased FURO+CAP-induced 1.8% NaCl intake (12.2\u00b13.5, vs., saline: 4.2\u00b10.8 ml/180 min), reduced water intake and strongly increased arterial pressure (50\u00b17, vs. saline: 1\u00b11 mmHg). The blockade of the \u03b11 adrenoceptors with the prazosin injected intraperitoneally abolished the pressor response and increased 1.8% NaCl and water intake in rats treated with FURO+CAP combined with noradrenaline injected into the LPBN. The deactivation of baro and perhaps volume receptors due to the cardiovascular effects of prazosin is a mechanism that may facilitate water and NaCl intake in rats treated with FURO+CAP combined with noradrenaline injected into the LPBN. Therefore, the activation of \u03b12 adrenoceptors with noradrenaline injected into the LPBN, at least in dose tested, may not completely remove the inhibitory signals produced by the activation of the cardiovascular receptors, particularly the signals that result from the extra activation of these receptors with the increase of arterial pressure.",

    "106": "Sodium restriction potentiates the efficacy of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blockade and improves long-term cardiovascular and renal protection, even independent of the better blood pressure control. The mechanisms underlying the potentiation of cardiorenal protection by sodium restriction are incompletely understood. RAAS-blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors increases circulating levels of the anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic peptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), which is assumed to contribute to its therapeutic effects. We hypothesized that sodium restriction on top of RAAS-blockade further increases AcSDKP, as a possible explanation for the enhanced effects of RAAS-blockade during sodium restriction.", 
    "107": "To test this hypothesis, we performed a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial investigating 46 nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (age 50\u00b113 years, 80% men) with overt proteinuria and mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Patients were subjected, in a crossover design, to four double-blind 6-week study periods with either regular sodium diet (194\u00b149 mmol Naday) or low sodium diet (102\u00b152 mmol Na/day) on top of either lisinopril (40 mg/day; single RAAS-blockade) or lisinopril plus valsartan (320 mg/day; dual RAAS-blockade).", 
    "108": "Sodium restriction significantly increased circulating levels of AcSDKP during single and dual RAAS-blockade (P=0.032 and 0.042, respectively). Linear mixed-model analysis confirmed that AcSDKP levels were increased in response to sodium restriction, irrespective of sex, age, creatinine clearance, blood pressure, BMI, single or dual RAAS-blockade, treatment sequence and other dietary factors, that is calcium and protein (P=0.020).", 
    "109": "In patients with nondiabetic CKD, we demonstrated that sodium restriction, on top of single and dual RAAS-blockade, increases circulating levels of the anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic peptide AcSDKP. The rise in AcSDKP may contribute to the increased protection of RAAS-blockade during sodium restriction.",

However, recommendations are based on natural history rather than direct assessment of a restrictive treatment strategy. Here, we describe the long-term outcomes of treating a large cohort of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy according to a restrictive treatment policy. We analyzed data for 254 patients who visited our outpatient clinic between 1995 and 2009. All patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers. Immunosuppressive therapy was recommended in cases of deteriorating renal function or untreatable nephrotic syndrome. Primary outcomes for the present study were renal replacement therapy and death. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during follow-up and remission of proteinuria. In total, 124 patients (49%) received immunosuppressive therapy, which predominantly consisted of cyclophosphamide combined with steroids. Ten-year cumulative incidence rates were 3% for renal replacement therapy and 10% for death. Partial remission rates were 39%, 70%, and 83% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively; complete remission rates were 5%, 24%, and 38% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. A serious adverse event occurred in 23% of all patients. The most notable complications were infections (17%), leukopenia (18%), cardiovascular events (13%), and malignancies (8%). In conclusion, the use of a restrictive treatment strategy in this cohort of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy yielded favorable outcomes while limiting the number of patients exposed to toxic drugs. These results support current KDIGO guidelines.",

Three (15%) patients developed acute renal failure (ARF) after the initiation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and 13 (65%) patients presented with chronic kidney disease (CKD) of either ischemic nephropathy or nephroangiosclerosis etiology. Four (20%) patients presented with resistant arterial hypertension (RAH). Plasma renin activity was elevated in all the patients. Fifteen (75%) patients were diabetics.

Some clinical heterogeneity and varying risk of bias were noted amongst the studies, although we were able to meaningfully interpret the data. Results showed significant heterogeneity and indicated that most interventions provided no benefit.Data on perioperative mortality were reported in 41 studies and data on acute renal injury in 44 studies (all interventions combined). Because of considerable clinical heterogeneity (different clinical scenarios, as well as considerable methodological variability amongst the studies), we did not perform a meta-analysis on the combined data.Subgroup analysis of major interventions and surgical procedures showed no significant influence of interventions on reported mortality and acute renal injury. For the subgroup of participants who had pre-existing renal damage, the risk of mortality from 10 trials (959 participants) was estimated as odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.52; the risk of acute renal injury (as reported in the trials) was estimated from 11 trials (979 participants) as OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80.

So it seems important to estimate the adequacy of the medical prescriptions to the guidelines in this population and for these diseases. A retrospective analysis was performed in nine hospitals on 736 patients aged 65 years old and over hospitalized in the acute care geriatric unit. Cardiovascular prescribing were analyzed for each patient according to STOPP and START. The population (n=736) has a mean age of 86.7 years and belongs in 45.0% of the cases to the group of dependence GIR3-4. According to STOPP, two inappropriate prescriptions are noticed: calcium channel blockers with chronic constipation concerning 9% of the included population and aspirin at dose >\u2009150 mg/day representing 8.4% of this population. According to START, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor are under-prescribed in elderly patients with heart failure (140 patients\u2009=\u200919.0% of the population) and following acute myocardial infarction (116 patients\u2009=\u200915.8%). Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation is also under-prescribed: 82 patients are concerned (11.0% of the population). The prescription of ACE inhibitor is influenced by renal insufficency in patients with heart failure. The anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation is age and dependence-related. This analysis demonstrates an inadequacy between the clinical practice and guidelines for two major cardiovascular diseases: the heart failure and the atrial fibrillation.

In a post hoc analysis of the Olmesartan Reducing Incidence of Endstage renal disease in diabetic Nephropathy Trial with hypertension, we examined the effects of olmesartan on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in the presence or absence of an ACEI. Among 563 patients randomized to receive either olmesartan (n = 280) or placebo (n = 283), 73.5% (n = 414) received a concomitant ACEI. Compared with placebo, olmesartan significantly reduced proteinuria in both the ACEI-treated and non-ACEI-treated groups. The respective changes in the urinary protein creatinine ratio in the olmesartan-treated and placebo-treated groups were -32.6% and +21.1% without an ACEI (P = 0.001) and -17.0% and +2.2% with an ACEI (P = 0.028). In the olmesartan group, 115 patients developed primary renal outcomes (41.1%) compared with 129 (45.6%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio (HR): 0.97, P = 0.787).

The respective HRs in the ACEI-treated and non-ACEI-treated groups were 0.69 (P = 0.129) and 0.51 (P = 0.129). Olmesartan was well tolerated. Dual blockade treatment caused more hyperkalemia than monotherapy. In patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension, olmesartan significantly reduced proteinuria, independent of ACEI treatment and cardiovascular outcome but failed to show additional renal benefit compared with ACEI treatment alone.

This has become a global concern because of the lack of clinically approved inhibitors so far. The emergence of New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase I (NDM-1) makes the situation even more serious. In this work, first, the structure of NDM-1 in complex with the inhibitor molecule l-captopril is investigated by both density functional theory (DFT) and hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the X-ray structure. The Michaelis structure with an antibiotic compound (ampicillin) bound in the active site is constructed from a recent X-ray structure of the NDM-1 enzyme with hydrolyzed ampicillin. It is further simulated using a QM/MM molecular dynamics method. One of the interesting binding features of ampicillin in the NDM-1 active site is that the conserved C3 carboxylate group is not ligated with Zn2 but rather is only hydrogen-bonded with N220 and K211. A bridging hydroxide ion is suggested to connect two zinc cofactors. This hydroxide ion is also hydrogen-bonded with D124. Subsequent reaction path calculations indicate that the initial step of lactam ring-opening occurs through a concerted step in which the cleavage of the C-N bond and the transfer of the hydrogen bond to D124 are nearly concerted. The ligand bond between Zn2 and the C3 carboxylate group forms after the first step of nucleophilic addition. The calculated activation energy barrier height is about 19.4 kcal/mol for the hydrolysis of ampicillin, which can be compared with the experimental value of 15.8 kcal/mol derived from kcat = 15 s(-1). The overall mechanism is finally confirmed by a subsequent DFT study of a truncated active-site model.",

Two groups including 160 patients with OSCC and 168 healthy controls of Greek and German origin were studied. The patient and control groups were comparable regarding ethnicity, age and gender. For all studied individuals, 10 genotypes of functional polymorphisms were investigated: 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, coagulation factor V (F5) Leiden, coagulation factor II (F2, also known as prothrombin) G20210A, coagulation factor XII (F12) C46T, coagulation factor XIII A1 subunit (F13A1) Val34Leu, serpine1 (SERPINE1, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) 4G/5G, protein Z (PROZ) -A13G, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) I/D, angiotensinogen (AGT) Met325Thr, and carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2, also known as thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) C1040T.

We therefore studied the influence of four widely used anesthetics - pentobarbital (P), isoflurane (ISO), ketamine-xylazine (KX) and chloralose-urethane (CU) - on the participation of these vasoactive systems in BP maintenance. BP effects elicited by the acute sequential blockade of RAS (captopril), SNS (pentolinium) and NO synthase (L-NAME) were compared in conscious and anesthetized Wistar or spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Except for pentobarbital all studied anesthetics evidenced by diminished BP responses to pentolinium. The absolute pentolinium-induced BP changes were always greater in SHR than Wistar rats. KX anesthesia eliminated BP response to pentolinium and considerably enhanced BP response to NO synthase inhibition in SHR. In both rat strains the anesthesia with ISO or CU augmented BP response to captopril, decreased BP response to pentolinium and attenuated BP response to NO synthase inhibition. In conclusion, pentobarbital anesthesia had a modest influence on BP level and its maintenance by the above vasoactive systems. Isoflurane and chloralose-urethane anesthesia may be used in cardiovascular experiments if substantial BP decrease due to altered contribution of RAS, SNS and NO to BP regulation does not interfere with the respective research aim. Major BP reduction (namely in SHR) due to a complete SNS absence is a major drawback of ketamine-xylazine anesthesia.",

    "153": "Whether peptidases present in vascular cells can activate prodrugs active on vascular cells has been tested with 2 potential latent ligands of the histamine H1 receptor (H1R). First, a peptide consisting of the antihistamine cetirizine (CTZ) condensed at the N-terminus of \u03b5-aminocaproyl-bradykinin (\u03b5ACA-BK) was evaluated for an antihistamine activity that could be revealed by degradation of the peptide part of the molecule. CTZ-\u03b5ACA-BK had a submicromolar affinity for the BK B2 receptor (B2R; IC50 of 590 nM, [(3)H]BK binding competition), but a non-negligible affinity for the human H1 receptor (H1R; IC50 of 11 \u03bcM for [(3)H]pyrilamine binding). In the human isolated umbilical vein, a system where both endogenous B2R and H1R mediate strong contractions, CTZ-\u03b5ACA-BK exerted mild antagonist effects on histamine-induced contraction that were not modified by omapatrilat or by a B2R antagonist that prevents endocytosis of the BK conjugate. Cells expressing recombinant ACE or B2R incubated with CTZ-\u03b5ACA-BK did not release a competitor of [(3)H]pyrilamine binding to H1Rs. Thus, there is no evidence that CTZ-\u03b5ACA-BK can release free cetirizine in biological environments. The second prodrug was a blocked agonist, L-alanyl-histamine, potentially activated by aminopeptidase N (APN). This compound did not compete for [(3)H]pyrilamine binding to H1Rs. The human umbilical vein contractility assay responded to L-alanyl-histamine (EC50 54.7 \u03bcM), but the APN inhibitor amastatin massively (17-fold) reduced its apparent potency. Amastatin did not influence the potency of histamine as a contractile agent. One of the 2 tested latent H1R ligands, L-alanyl-histamine, supported the feasibility of pro-drug activation by vascular ectopeptidases.", 
    "154": "ACE (angiotensin-1-converting enzyme) is a zinc metallopeptidase that plays a prominent role in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte homeostasis. ACE consists of two homologous domains that despite similarities of sequence and topology display differences in substrate processing and inhibitor binding. The design of inhibitors that selectively inhibit the N-domain (N-selective) could be useful in treating conditions of tissue injury and fibrosis due to build-up of N-domain-specific substrate Ac-SDKP (N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro). Using a receptor-based SHOP (scaffold hopping) approach with N-selective inhibitor RXP407, a shortlist of scaffolds that consisted of modified RXP407 backbones with novel chemotypes was generated. These scaffolds were selected on the basis of enhanced predicted interaction energies with N-domain residues that differed from their C-domain counterparts. One scaffold was synthesized and inhibitory binding tested using a fluorogenic ACE assay. A molecule incorporating a tetrazole moiety in the P2 position (compound 33RE) displayed potent inhibition (K(i)=11.21\u00b10.74 nM) and was 927-fold more selective for the N-domain than the C-domain. A crystal structure of compound 33RE in complex with the N-domain revealed its mode of binding through aromatic stacking with His388 and a direct hydrogen bond with the hydroxy group of the N-domain specific Tyr369. This work further elucidates the molecular basis for N-domain-selective inhibition and assists in the design of novel N-selective ACE inhibitors that could be employed in treatment of fibrosis disorders.", 
    "155": "In Sprague-Dawley rats (SD), we compared two categories of natural dietary supplements that influence carbohydrate (CHO) metabolism via different basic mechanisms to ameliorate insulin resistance (IR) and elevated blood pressure (BP) associated with heavy sugar/starch consumption. Two dietary supplements (bean extract and l-arabinose) are often referred to as carb blockers (CBs), because they slow the gastrointestinal absorption of CHO. Trivalent chromium (CR) falls into a group of so-called insulin sensitizers, because its major effect is to enhance peripheral insulin sensitivity.",

The remaining 3 SD groups (groups 2-4) ingested regular rat chow containing 20% w/w sucrose and 20% w/w rice starch. The second group received only this CHO-enriched chow. To the high-CHO diets of the remaining two groups, either CB to slow CHO absorption (CHO + CB) (group 3) or an insulin sensitizer, trivalent CR (CHO + CR; group 4), was added.", 
    "157": "Compared to Con group 1, adding high CHO content to the diet of group 2 significantly increased circulating glucose levels and systolic BP (SBP). Addition of CB or CR to the feed of groups 3 and 4 overcame the perturbations that occurred with high CHO challenge in group 2; that is, they lowered circulating glucose concentrations to Con levels, enhanced response to exogenous insulin, and overcame the gradual elevation of SBP. Compared to group 2, the two treatment groups (3 and 4) also showed decreased renin-angiotensin system activity, decreased serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, and enhanced nitric oxide activity.", 
    "158": "Our data indicate that high doses of CB and CR, despite their different mechanisms of action, can completely overcome CHO-induced IR and BP elevations. The data further suggest that CB and CR affect only the changes brought on by heavy CHO ingestion, because IR and SBP in groups 3 and 4 mirrored Con values (group 1), never producing values lower than baseline. Earlier use of CB and CR in the life cycle appears more effective in overcoming CHO-induced perturbations than later use.", 
    "159": "With the astounding morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure (HF), preventive approaches have been explored. Controlling hypertension to prevent HF is well-established, especially with sodium restriction and thiazide-based antihypertensive therapies showing potential advantages. Control of dyslipidemia with aggressive statin therapy is particularly beneficial in preventing HF in the setting of acute coronary syndrome. The HOPE study also established the benefit of ACE inhibitors in the prevention of HF in high-risk subjects. Meanwhile old data supporting tight glycemic control in preventing HF have not been confirmed, suggesting the complexity of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Avoiding tobacco use and other known cardiotoxins are likely helpful. While there has been substantial development in identifying biomarkers predicting future development of HF, therapeutic interdiction guided by biomarker levels have yet to be established, even though it offers hope in modulating the natural history of the development of HF in at-risk individuals.",

Here, we develop an assay to detect a broad range of cardiovascular drug classes to include commonly used cardiovascular drugs and evaluate the assay's analytical and statistical properties in a clinical setting. We describe a protocol for drug detection that encompasses 34 commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs or drug metabolites with a single LC-MS/MS method using 100\u03bcL of serum or plasma. Drug classes monitored by this assay include: anticoagulants, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, statins, and vasodilators, as well as digoxin, fenofibrate, and niacin. Analytical accuracy and precision for each drug were evaluated by repeating the assay on spiked samples at low, medium, and high concentrations. In 294 clinical samples obtained from hospitalized patients for whom medication administration was recorded, we evaluated the assay's statistical sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. For the 34 drugs or drug metabolites, the assay was statistically sensitive (>0.90) for all drugs except captopril (0.25), isosorbide (0.81), and niacin (0.89). The assay was statistically specific for all drugs, with a minimum specificity of 0.94 (aspirin). To our knowledge, this method is the first method of simultaneous analysis of 34 cardiovascular drugs or drug metabolites from nine drug classes evaluated using clinical samples from hospitalized patients.",

The RAM-HPLC system consisted of an RAM column as enrichment column and a C18 column as analytical column coupled via the column switching technique. The effects of the injection volume on the peak area and the systematic pressure were studied. When the injection volume was less than 100 microL, the peak area increased with the increase of the injection volume. However, when the injection volume was more than 80 microL, the pressure of whole system increased obviously. In order to protect the whole system, 80 microL was chosen as the maximum injection volume. The peak areas of ordinary injection and the large volume injection showed a good linear relationship. The enrichment ability of RAM-HPLC system was satisfactory. The system was successfully used for the separation and detection of the trace benazepril hydrochloride in rat plasma after its administration. The sensitivity of HPLC can be improved by RAM pre-enrichment. It is a simple and economic measurement method.",

In embryonic chickens, high plasma ANG II levels contribute to baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP, kPa) without changing heart rate (\u0192H, beats/min). We hypothesized, on the basis of these features, that an ANG II-induced reduction in baroreflex sensitivity is present in embryonic chickens as in adults. We examined baroreflex function in day 19 embryonic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) after chronic depletion of endogenous ANG II via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril (5 mg/kg) from days 5-18 of incubation. The correlation between MAP and \u0192H was assessed using increasing doses of sodium nitroprusside, a vasodilator, and phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor. We used two analytical methods to evaluate baroreflex function: a conventional \"static\" method, in which maximal MAP and \u0192H responses were examined, and a \"dynamic\" method that assessed beat-to-beat changes during the response to pharmacological manipulation. Captopril-treated embryos were hypotensive by 19% with baroreflex slopes \u223c40% steeper and normalized gains \u223c50% higher than controls, and differences across treatments were similar using either analytical method. Furthermore, reintroduction of ANG II via infusion raised MAP back to control levels and decreased the baroreflex gain in captopril-treated embryos. Therefore, during typical chicken development, ANG II dampens the baroreflex regulatory capacity and chicken embryos can be used as a natural model of elevated ANG II for studying developmental cardiovascular function. This study is the first to demonstrate that reduction of embryonic ANG II alters normal baroreflex function.",

The developed method is applicable for the determination of related substances in bulk drugs and simultaneous assay in a tablet pharmaceutical dosage form. Separation of the drugs and their degradation products was obtained using an RP Waters Spherisorb ODS1 column (250 x 4.6 mm id, 5 pm particle size) with the mobile phase acetonitrile-water (30 + 70, v/v) containing 15 mM phosphoric acid. The pH of the mobile phase was adjusted to 5.0. A flow rate of 1.2 mL/min was used for the separations, with detection at 215 nm. The chromatographic separation was performed at a column temperature of 45 degrees C. Atenolol was chosen as the internal standard. Amlodipine and perindopril were exposed to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions, and the stressed samples were analyzed by the proposed method. Degradation studies showed that both compounds were degraded under these stress conditions.

Our goal was to determine if foam cell formation increases angiotensin II generation by the endogenous renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and if endogenously produced angiotensin II promotes lipid accumulation in macrophages. Differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with acetylated low-density lipoproteins (ac-LDL), native LDL (n-LDL), or no LDL. Expression of RAS genes was assessed and angiotensin I/II levels were quantified in media and cell lysate. Ac-LDL increased angiotensin I/II levels and the angiotensin II/I ratio in cells and media after foam cell formation. Renin mRNA or activity did not change, but renin blockade completely inhibited the increase in angiotensin II. Angiotensinogen mRNA but not protein level was increased. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and cathepsin G mRNA and activities were enhanced by ac-LDL. Inhibition of renin, ACE, or the angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1-receptor) largely abolished cholesteryl ester formation in cells exposed to ac-LDL and decreased scavenger receptor A (SR-A) and acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT-1) protein levels. Inhibition of renin or the AT1-receptor in cells treated with oxidized LDL also decreased SR-A and ACAT-1 protein and foam cell formation. ac-LDL also increased angiotensin II by human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages, whereas blockade of renin decreased cholesterol ester formation in these macrophages. These findings indicate that, during foam cell formation, angiotensin II generation by the endogenous RAS is stimulated and that endogenously generated angiotensin II is crucial for cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages exposed to modified LDL.",

The existence of renin-angiotensin system components in the brain has been well established. Angiotensin II and other renin-angiotensin system components are synthesized and distributed throughout the brain. Post-ischemic oral administration of a non-hypotensive dose (1/10th of the clinical dose) of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has protective effects on reducing cerebral ischemic injury and improving neurological outcomes. Brain tissue angiotensin II levels transiently increase after reperfusion through the local generation of angiotensin IIand not via the transudation of plasma angiotensin II. Systemic administration of ARBs decreases brain tissue angiotensin II in both the intact and ischemic brain tissue via downregulation of angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme mRNA expression, although plasma ARB barely crosses the blood-brain barrier during systemic ARB treatment. Only hypotensive dose of ARB treatment opens leptomeningeal anastomoses.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association 2007 Guidelines on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Care for Noncardiac Surgery provide information on many drug classes used in the treatment of hypertension; noticeably absent is a guideline for ACE inhibitors. Literature demonstrates that practice standards vary on whether ACE inhibitor regimens are continued or withheld during the preoperative period. When ACE inhibitor therapy is continued in patients undergoing general anesthesia, varying degrees of hypotension can be seen depending on confounding patient variables and the type of surgical procedure. In some instances, this hypotension can be refractory to traditional interventions such as administration of a fluid bolus, ephedrine, or phenylephrine. Vasopressin and methylene blue have been found to be effective treatments for ACE inhibitor-associated refractory hypotension. With the prevalence of hypertension and use of ACE inhibitors, anesthesia providers are likely to encounter refractory hypotension of this nature.

Based on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies, this review explains the roles of RAS in bone metabolism and also covers the potential approaches and beneficial effects of RAS inhibition on bone health. Differential strategies for inhibiting RAS can be employed to maintain bone health, which are attributed primarily to the reduced level of angiotensin II (AngII) and suppressed stimulation of the AngII signaling pathway.

Renal expression of FGF23 and Klotho was assessed in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and control lean rats at 2, 4, 6, 8 months of age. To evaluate whether the renoprotective effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in this model was associated with changes in FGF23 and Klotho, ZDF rats received ramipril from 4, when proteinuric, to 8 months of age. FGF23 mRNA was not detectable in the kidney of lean rats, nor of ZDF rats at 2 months of age. FGF23 became measurable in the kidney of diabetic rats at 4 months and significantly increased thereafter. FGF23 protein localized in proximal and distal tubules. Renal Klotho mRNA and protein decreased during time in ZDF rats. As renal disease progressed, serum phosphate levels increased in parallel with decline of fractional phosphorus excretion. Ramipril limited proteinuria and renal injury, attenuated renal FGF23 upregulation and ameliorated Klotho expression. Ramipril normalized serum phosphate levels and tended to increase fractional phosphorus excretion. These data indicate that during progressive renal disease the kidney is a site of FGF23 production which is limited by ACE inhibition. Interfering pharmacologically with the delicate balance of FGF23 and phosphorus in diabetes may have implications in clinics.",

Pharmacological protection of microvascular endothelium might produce a double benefit: (i) reduction of myocardial toxicity (the primary target of Doxorubicin action) and (ii) maintenance of the vascular functionality for the adequate delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells. This study was aimed to evaluate the mechanisms responsible of the protective effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) Zofenoprilat against the toxic effects exerted by Doxorubicin on coronary microvascular endothelium. We found that exposure of endothelial cells to Doxorubicin (0.1-1\u03bcM range) impaired cell survival by promoting their apoptosis. ERK1/2 related p53 activation, but not reactive oxygen species, was responsible for Doxorubicin induced caspase-3 cleavage. P53 mediated-apoptosis and impairment of survival were reverted by treatment with Zofenoprilat. The previously described PI-3K/eNOS/endogenous fibroblast growth factor signaling was not involved in the protective effect, which, instead, could be ascribed to cystathionine gamma lyase dependent availability of H2S from Zofenoprilat. Furthermore, considering the tumor environment, the treatment of endothelial/tumor co-cultures with Zofenoprilat did not affect the antitumor efficacy of Doxorubicin. In conclusion the ACEI Zofenoprilat exerts a protective effect on Doxorubicin induced endothelial damage, without affecting its antitumor efficacy. Thus, sulfhydryl containing ACEI may be a useful therapy for Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.",

Experimental evidence indicates that inhibition of brain ROS could be beneficial in slowing the neurodegenerative process triggered by amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates. The angiotensin II AT1 receptor is a significant source of brain ROS, and AD patients have an increased brain angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level, which could account for an excessive angiotensin-dependent AT1-induced ROS generation. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of ACE inhibition on signs of neurodegeneration of aged Tg2576 mice as a transgenic animal model of AD. Whole genome microarray gene expression profiling and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the centrally active ACE inhibitor captopril normalized the excessive hippocampal ACE activity of AD mice. Concomitantly, the development of signs of neurodegeneration was retarded by six months of captopril treatment. The neuroprotective profile triggered by captopril was accompanied by reduced amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and decreased hippocampal ROS, which is known to enhance Abeta generation by increased activation of beta- and gamma-secretases. Taken together, our data present strong evidence that ACE inhibition with a widely used cardiovascular drug could interfere with Abeta-dependent neurodegeneration.",

We retrospectively analysed 448 consecutive patients with CSDH treated by one burr hole surgery at our institution. Among them, 58 patients had been on antiplatelet therapy. We discontinued the antiplatelet agents before surgery for all 58 patients. For 51 of these 58 patients (87.9%), early surgery was performed within 0-2 days from admission. We analysed the association between recurrence and patient characteristics, including history of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy; age (< 70 years or \u2265 70 years); side; history of angiotensin receptor II blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme blocker, or statin therapy; and previous medical history of head trauma, infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, haemodialysis, seizure, cancer, or liver cirrhosis. RESULTS. Recurrence occurred in 40 patients (8.9%), which was one of the lowest rates in the literature. Univariate analysis showed that only the presence of bilateral haematomas was associated with increased recurrence rate while antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy did not significantly increase recurrence risk. Also, the recurrence rate from early surgery (0-2 days from drug cessation) for patients on antiplatelet therapy was not significantly higher than that from elective surgery (5 days or more after drug cessation). However, multivariate analysis revealed that previous history of cerebral infarction was an independent risk factor for CSDH recurrence. CONCLUSIOns. Our overall data support the safety of early surgery for patients on the preoperative antiplatelet therapy without drug cessation or platelet infusion.

Using the longitudinal data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) with ApoE genotyping and documentation of ACE inhibitors use, we found that in the absence of ApoE4, subjects who had been taking central ACE inhibitor use (\u03c72 test: 21% versus 27%, p = 0.0002) or peripheral ACE inhibitor use (\u03c72 test: 13% versus 27%, p < 0.0001) had lower incidence of AD compared with those who had not been taking an ACE inhibitor.

In conclusion, ACE inhibitors, especially peripherally acting ones, were associated with a reduced risk of AD in the absence of ApoE4, but had no such effect in those carrying the ApoE4 allele. A double-blind clinical trial should be considered to determine the effect of ACE inhibitors on prevention of AD in the context of ApoE genotype.",

The polymersomes exhibited high encapsulation efficiencies of almost 78% and 70.8% for atorvastatin and lisinopril, respectively. Investigation on FTIR and DSC results revealed that such a high encapsulation efficiency is due to strong interaction between atorvastatin and the copolymer. The impact of drug/copolymer ratio and copolymer composition on drug-loading efficiency and drug release behavior were also studied. The results showed that in case of lisinopril, polymersomes exhibited a triphasic drug release, while for atorvastatin a biphasic release profile was obtained.

Original drug, as compared to its generic copies, had the lowest values and also the lowest variability of all the tested parameters--type, total number and content of impurities--suggesting that its manufacturing process is to certain degree better controlled compared to other manufacturers. A characteristic impurity C appearing in all the assessed preparations has the lowest levels in the original drug, whereas the amount of the highest unknown impurity does not exceed 0.10% in any of the analyzed preparations. Although the original drug stands out from all the generic preparations with its purity, it can be generally concluded that, as regarding impurities levels, all the analyzed medicinal products are within the ranges of specification limits; accordingly, it is therefore not expected that, in case of lisinopril tablets, administration of the original drug as compared to any of its generic drugs, will be safer for the patient.",

Histochemical assessment on bone paraffin sections was conducted by Safranin O staining and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Micro-computed tomography was performed to analyze bone biological parameters. Gene and protein expression were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Type 1 diabetic mice displayed osteopenia phenotype and captopril treatment showed no osteoprotective effects in diabetic mice as shown by the reduction of bone mineral density, trabecular thickness and bone volume/total volume. The mRNA expression of ACE and renin receptor, and the protein expression of renin and angiotensin II were markedly up-regulated in the bone of vehicle-treated diabetic mice compared to those of non-diabetic mice, and these molecular changes of skeletal RAS components were effectively inhibited by treatment with captopril. However, treatment with captopril significantly elevated serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b levels, reduced the ratio of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand expression, increased carbonic anhydrase II mRNA expression and the number of matured osteoclasts and decreased transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and osteocalcin mRNA expression in the tibia compared to those of diabetic mice. The present study demonstrated that the use of the ACEI, captopril, has no beneficial effect on the skeletal biological properties of diabetic mice.

Moreover, there is a large amount of evidence to suggest that perindopril therapy may reduce cardiovascular event rates in patients, yet perindopril is rarely prescribed in the United States. Ramipril is another ACE inhibitor with both a favorable clinical profile and impressive outcomes data. Our review compares the pharmacologic and trial data among perindopril, ramipril, and other ACE inhibitors. In patients with or at high risk for coronary heart disease who do not have heart failure, or in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, perindopril should be among the preferred treatment agents in the ACE inhibitor class.

One of these peptides, Bj-PRO-9a, was essential for defining ACE as effective drug target and development of captopril, an active site-directed inhibitor of ACE used worldwide for the treatment of human arterial hypertension. Recent experimental evidences demonstrated that cardiovascular effects exerted by different Bj-PROs are due to distinct mechanisms besides of ACE inhibition. In the present work, we have investigated the cardiovascular actions of four Bj-PROs, namely Bj-PRO-9a, -11e, -12b and -13a. Bj-PRO-9a acts upon ACE and BK activities to promote blood pressure reduction. Although the others Bj-PROs are also able to inhibit the ACE activity and to potentiate the BK effects, our results indicate that antihypertensive effect evoked by them involve new mechanisms. Bj-PRO-11e and Bj-PRO-12b involves induction of [Ca(2+)]i transients by so far unknown receptor proteins. Moreover, we have suggested argininosuccinate synthetase and M3 muscarinic receptor as targets for cardiovascular effects elicited by Bj-PRO-13a. In summary, the herein reported results provide evidence that Bj-PRO-mediated effects are not restricted to ACE inhibition or potentiation of BK-induced effects and suggest different actions for each peptide for promoting arterial pressure reduction. The present study reveals the complexity of the effects exerted by Bj-PROs for cardiovascular control, opening avenues for the better understanding of blood pressure regulation and for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

At baseline, all patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), of whom 76% received optimal doses. After 6 months of CRT, \u03b2-B were administered to 76% of patients, in optimaklon ACE or ARB but 75% of them were receiving maximal doses. After 6 months of CRT, \u03b2 blockers have been introduced in 72% of patients and maximal doses have been achieved in 60% of them. Maximal doses of ACE or ARB were reached in 95% of the study population. We noticed that systolic blood pressure was higher after implantation.

In our study we have evaluated the systemic effect of RAAS blockade and the effect on peritoneal growth factors, cytokine production and membrane transport characteristics in patients on peritoneal dialysis. Thirty-seven peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients were enrolled in our cross-sectional study. Aldosterone and angiotensin II concentrations were measured in serum to determine the RAAS activity. The inflammatory and profibrotic activity was evaluated by measuring the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum albumin, and peritoneal concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and cancer antigen-125 (CA-125). The transport characteristics of the peritoneal membrane were analyzed with a peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Results were compared between the group with RAAS-blocking drugs (RAAS group) and the group without them (non-RAAS group). Mean serum aldosterone concentration was significantly lower in patients treated with ARB-blocking drugs (P\u2009=\u20090.001) and serum angiotensin II concentration was lower in patients treated with ACE inhibitors (P\u2009=\u20090.009). RAAS blockade resulted in lower peritoneal PAI-1 levels (748.1 to 1222.7\u2009ng/L; P\u2009=\u20090.07) without any influence on CRP, peritoneal concentrations of IL-6, VEGF, TGF-\u03b2 and CA-125, or alteration in peritoneal membrane characteristics tested by PET. RAAS-blocking drugs could be effective in preventing peritoneal fibrosis due to possible reduction of peritoneal PAI-1 concentrations that have already been etiologically linked with fibrin deposition in the pathogenesis of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis.",

We aimed to address whether active vitamin D analogs reduce residual proteinuria. We systematically searched for trials published between 1950 and September of 2012 in the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. All randomized controlled trials of vitamin D analogs in patients with CKD that reported an effect on proteinuria with sample size\u226550 were selected. Mean differences of proteinuria change over time and odds ratios for reaching \u226515% proteinuria decrease from baseline to last measurement were synthesized under a random effects model. From 907 citations retrieved, six studies (four studies with paricalcitol and two studies with calcitriol) providing data for 688 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Most patients (84%) used an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker throughout the study. Active vitamin D analogs reduced proteinuria (weighted mean difference from baseline to last measurement was -16% [95% CI, -13% to -18%]) compared with controls (+6% [95% CI, 0% to +12%]; P<0.001). Proteinuria reduction was achieved more commonly in patients treated with an active vitamin D analog (204/390 patients) than control patients (86/298 patients; OR, 2.72 [95% CI, 1.82 to 4.07]; P<0.001). Thus, active vitamin D analogs may further reduce proteinuria in CKD patients in addition to current regimens. Future studies should address whether vitamin D therapy also retards progressive renal functional decline.", 
    "448": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common causes of terminal stadium damage to the kidneys. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) represents a significant risk factor for the progression of DN. ACE inhibitors are medications of particular interest knowing the role of angiotensin II in the development of DN. This study aimed to examine the effects of ACE inhibitor treatment perindopril (PER), administered to rats with streptozotocin (STZ) induced DN, that developed albuminuria, renal hypertrophy and mild glomerulussclerosis. DN was induced by a STZ (60 mg/kg ip) single injection to normotensive Wistar rats. The administration of STZ caused diabetes mellitus (DM) with symptoms and signs of DN including poor general condition, body-weight loss, kidney weight increase as well as increased values of BUN and serum creatinine, accompanied by increased diuresis as well as distinct albuminuria. The majority of these symptoms were manifested 4 weeks after, and even more distinctly 8 and 12 weeks after administering STZ. The perindopril treatment (6 mg/kg BW), starting 4 weeks after administering STZ, resulted in a significant improvement of all symptoms and signs of DN, significantly lowering the values of BUN and serum creatinine, albuminuria and diuresis. The histopathological examination of the renal samples at 8 and 12 weeks after the beginning of the study have shown that perindopril significantly lowers the progression of glomerulopathy, and significantly improves the glomerulosclerotic index, as well as the progression of renal histological abnormalities induced with STZ. Thus perindopril treatment ameliorates STZ-induced nephropathic changes in DM rats.", 
    "449": "Increased arterial endothelial cell permeability (ECP) is considered an initial step in atherosclerosis. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) which is rapidly degraded by neprilysin (NEP) may reduce injury-induced endothelial cell leakiness. Omapatrilat represents a first in class of pharmacological agents which inhibits both NEP and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). We hypothesized that ANP prevents thrombin-induced increases of ECP in human aortic ECs (HAECs) and that omapatrilat would reduce aortic leakiness and atherogenesis and enhance ANP mediated vasorelaxation of isolated aortas. Thrombin induced ECP determined by I(125) albumin flux was assessed in HAECs with and without ANP pretreatment. Next we examined the effects of chronic oral administration of omapatrilat (12 mg/kg/day, n=13) or placebo (n=13) for 8 weeks on aortic leakiness, atherogenesis and ANP-mediated vasorelaxation in isolated aortas in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis produced by high cholesterol diet. In HAECs, thrombin-induced increases in ECP were prevented by ANP. Omapatrilat reduced the area of increased aortic leakiness determined by Evans-blue dye and area of atheroma formation assessed by Oil-Red staining compared to placebo. In isolated arterial rings, omapatrilat enhanced vasorelaxation to ANP compared to placebo with and without the endothelium. ANP prevents thrombin-induced increases in ECP in HAECs. Chronic oral administration of omapatrilat reduces aortic leakiness and atheroma formation with enhanced endothelial independent vasorelaxation to ANP. These studies support the therapeutic potential of dual inhibition of NEP and ACE in the prevention of increased arterial ECP and atherogenesis which may be linked to the ANP/cGMP system.", 
    "450": "Citrate is a powerful inhibitor of the crystallization of calcium salts. Hypocitraturia is a biochemical common alteration in calcium stone formation in adults and especially in children. The acid pH (systemic, tubular and intracellular) is the main determinant of citrate excretion in the urine. While the etiology of hypocitraturia is idiopathic in most patients with kidney stones, there are a number of causes for this abnormality including distal renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemia, diets rich in animal protein and / or diets low in alkali and certain drugs, such as acetazolamide, topiramate, ACE inhibitors and thiazides. Dietary modifications that benefit these patients include high intake of fluids and fruits, especially citrus, sodium and protein restriction, with normal calcium intake. Treatment with potassium citrate is effective in patients with primary or secondary hypocitraturia and acidification disorders, which cause unduly acidic urine pH persistently. Adverse effects are low and are referred to the gastrointestinal tract. While there are various preparations of citrate (potassium citrate, sodium citrate, potassium citrate, magnesium) in our country is available only potassium citrate powder that is useful to correct both the hypocitraturia and the low urinary pH and reduce markedly the recurrence of kidney stones.",

For this purpose the forced degradation test was used and the following environmental conditions were employed: RH = 76.4% and the temperature range of 313 - 333 K. For the determination of IMD content in the analyzed samples a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) technique was used. Three series of tablets were prepared: whole-blistered tablets, whole-bare tablets and halved-bare tablets, in order to analyze the influence of different in-home storage habits on IMD tablets' quality. In the course of the study, the degradation of IMD was observed in each series of tablets. The kinetic mechanisms and the thermodynamic parameters of these reactions were established. It was evidenced that halved IMD tablets stored without immediate packaging retain their quality only for 12 days while tablets stored according to label recommendations are stable for 513 days.",

Progression amongst new small molecules deposited like substance medicamentous blows itself. In this context, large pharmaceutical companies invest in peptide research to open therapeutic new prospects. Even if they are used as therapeutic agents for nearly one century in their natural form, the use of peptides remains parsimonious although we experienced a significant development since a few tens of years, in particular thanks to the clarification of the methods of production, chemical in solid or biological phase such as in phage display. Peptides present many advantages compared to traditional drugs that have small molecules, Generation of bioactive peptides by proteolysis of food proteins, using exogenous proteases, is a new and interesting approach for the production and identification of new and potent specific hypotensive agents. From another side, compared with natural peptides isolated from different sources, there is more diversity in structure and mode of action of the derived bioactive peptides. In fact, proteolysis of protein substrates, having different amino acid composition and sequences, by proteases having different specificities may generate numerous specific peptide inhibitors, with different lengths and amino acid sequences.

In such cases, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist additively lowers the circulating blood volume and blood pressure despite the lower circulating aldosterone level. This mechanism may be explained by the increase in the number of MR under some conditions or the activation of these receptors independent of aldosterone. Future diagnostic tools to evaluate receptor activity may be valuable for the proper diagnosis and choice of therapy. Additionally, basic research has suggested that oxidative stress and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the brain represent new targets for the treatment of resistant hypertension.",

Indeed, there is no evidence that long-term aspirin should be given to patients even with known cardiovascular disease. Theoretical arguments that aspirin can prevent cardiovascular events by reducing the propagation of thrombus are countered by evidence that plaque haemorrhage from vasa vasorum may also cause plaque growth and instability. There is evidence that aspirin causes serious bleeding into the brain and the gut. Aspirin may also detract from the benefits of drugs that have definite cardiovascular benefits, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Meta-analysis is prone to multiple biases in favour of aspirin, including publication bias, bias due to trial and endpoint selection and bias due to interpretation. Meta-analysis should not be relied on in preference to adequately powered clinical trials. Unfortunately, the benefits of aspirin, if they exist, may be so small that a very large study indeed would be required to demonstrate that its benefits outweigh its risks. The evidence that aspirin might reduce cancer is intriguing but relies on data from trials conducted many decades ago using a wide range of aspirin doses.

For a better understanding of this phenomenon, we investigated the solution species of enalaprilat in the presence of copper(II) or zinc(II) ions by pH titration analysis with I=0.10 M (NaCl) at 25\u2103. The 1:1 complex formation constants (KML=[ML]/[M(2+)][L(2-)] M(-1)) of 10(7.4) for CuL and 10(4.4) for ZnL complexes were evaluated, indicating the presence of those complexes at a physiological pH. Furthermore, partition experiments with a two-phase system of 1-butanol/water at 25\u2103 disclosed that copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes of enalaprilat were partially extracted into the organic layer. In the absence of those metal ions, enalaprilat was not soluble in the 1-butanol phase. The increase in lipophilicity of enalaprilat by metal complexation suggests that the long-term administration of enalapril could be a possible risk factor for the disrupted distribution of those metal ions in biological systems.",

This was associated with 1.6-fold higher renal renin messenger RNA (mRNA; P=0.02) and 0.8-fold lower abundance of micro-RNA-181a (P=0.03), identified previously as regulating human renin mRNA. Renin mRNA levels correlated positively with depressor responses to pentolinium (r=0.99; P=0.001), and BPH/2J mice had greater renal sympathetic innervation density as identified by tyrosine hydroxylase staining of cortical tubules. Although there is a major sympathetic contribution to hypertension in BPH/2J mice, the renin-angiotensin system also contributes, doing so to a greater extent during the active period and less during the inactive period. This is the opposite of the normal renin-angiotensin system circadian pattern. We suggest that renal hyperinnervation and enhanced sympathetically induced renin synthesis mediated by lower micro-RNA-181a contributes to hypertension in BPH/2J mice.", 
    "533": "Enalapril maleate (EM) is a widely used anti-hypertensive drug which is unstable when mixed with excipients. Enalaprilate and diketopiperazine (DPK) are the main degradation products of enalapril. The in situ preparation of enalapril sodium salt (NaE) has been used to improve drug stability in dosage forms; however, gas release and product rejection ensue when the chemical reaction for obtaining the sodium salt is not completely finished before packaging. This study evaluated the effect of stearic acid (SA) on enalapril stability in microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) pellets containing EM or NaE. MCC pellets containing SA were prepared by the extrusion-spheronization technique and characterized. Enalapril stability and dissolution were then evaluated. DPK and enalaprilate formation were reduced by the addition of SA in pellets containing EM. The overall enalapril degradation in these formulations was lower when compared with pellets containing EM or even NaE prepared without SA. The immediate-release characteristic was maintained by the addition of 5% crospovidone to all the formulations tested. The incorporation of SA into NaE pellets resulted in unexpected enalapril degradation, caused by the interaction of these compounds, as suggested by a thermal analysis of the SA-NaE binary mixture. The findings presented here showed that formulations containing SA could substitute the formation of NaE, since they provide better enalapril stability in solid dosage forms. In addition, it is suggested that the stabilization effects would be observed for other N-carboxyalkyl dipeptide analogs with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition activity, since these new entities share the same degradation pathway of enalapril.", 
    "534": "Lead intoxication is usually insidious and may cause a variety of complications such as kidney damage and hypertension. The role of intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in lead-induced nephropathy has not been investigated. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with water containing 250ppm of lead acetate (lead group) and deionized water (control group) for 4weeks. Another two groups started to receive intraperitoneal captopril (50mg/kg/d) or losartan (10mg/kg/d) after 2weeks of lead feeding and continued for another 2weeks. Immunoblotting was used to analyze the protein amount of intrarenal RAS components and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2). Compared with control group, lead exposure resulted in increased proteinuria after 2-week treatment (4.2\u00b10.9mg/100g vs. 1.8\u00b10.8mg/100g, p<0.05) and 4-week (5.2\u00b11.7mg/100g, p<0.05). Serum creatinine level was increased (0.40\u00b10.2 vs. 0.3 \u00b1.04mg/dL, p<0.05) and calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was decreased (2.68\u00b11.03 vs. 3.37\u00b10.11mL/min, p<0.05). Intrarenal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (ANG II), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) were upregulated in lead group. Captopril and losartan administration reduced proteinuria significantly (3.0\u00b10.50mg/100g of captopril and 2.7\u00b10.4mg/100g of losartan group) and lowered systolic blood pressure when compared with lead group. Furthermore, serum creatinine levels and GFR were improved by RAS blockade. Captopril treatment significantly reduced protein abundance of ACE, ANG II, AT1R and TGF-\u03b2. Losartan treatment also decreased ANG II and TGF-\u03b2. We concluded that lead exposure elicited intrarenal RAS activation with associated proteinuria and impaired renal function. RAS blockade was effective in alleviating lead-associated kidney injury and lowering blood pressure.",

This study was aimed to investigate the hypertensive cardiac remodeling effects of the lignan extracts together with epalrestat. Ten-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 12, each) and administered 100 mg/kg/d of captopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), 100 mg/kg/d of epalrestat (aldose reductase inhibitor) or 300 mg/kg/d of lignan extracts by gavage for 16 weeks. Sex-, age-, and number-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats with spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with distilled water (vehicle) as controls. Systolic blood pressures were measured periodically. Echocardiography examination was taken when rats were 24 weeks old. We found that both captopril and lignan extracts lowered blood pressure, and inhibited aldose reductase activity similarly to epalrestat. Echocardiography examination and histomorphometry indices were improved in all treated groups (p < 0.05). Therefore, lignan extracts could prevent hypertensive cardiac remodeling, which is likely related to aldose reductase inhibition.", 
    "540": "Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are often used after ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF); the drugs employed vary, but most common are the drugs that were unsuccessful prior to ablation since it seems that the efficacy of AADs might substantially increase after catheter ablation of AF. AADs reduce early recurrences of atrial tachyarrhythmias after AF catheter ablation, whereas they did not prevent arrhythmia recurrences occurring later. Several upstream therapies (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, corticosteroids and colchicine) have been tested with conflicting results. To date, there is no sufficient evidence to support the use of any upstream therapy after AF catheter ablation. Larger registries and controlled clinical trials in well-defined patient groups and with well-defined outcome parameters are required to further elucidate the role of AADs after AF ablation.", 
    "541": "In spite of the novel antidiabetic drugs available on the market, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects nearly 25 million people in the USA and causes about 5% of all deaths globally each year. Given the rate and proportion by which T2DM is affecting human beings, it is indispensable to identify new therapeutic targets that can control the disease. Recent preclinical and clinical studies suggest that attenuating the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could improve glycemia in diabetic patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) counteracts RAS overactivity by degrading angiotensin-II (Ang-II), a vasoconstrictor, to Ang-(1-7) which is a vasodilator. A decrease in ACE2 and an increase in A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM17)-mediated shedding activity have been observed with the progression of T2DM, suggesting the importance of this mechanism in the disease. Indeed, restoration of ACE2 improves glycemia in db/db and Ang-II-infused mice. The beneficial effects of ACE2 can be attributed to reduced oxidative stress and ADAM17 expression in the islets of Langerhans in addition to the improvement of blood flow to the \u03b2-cells. The advantage of ACE2 over other RAS blockers is that ACE2 not only counteracts the negative effects of Ang-II but also increases Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor (MasR) [a receptor through which Ang-(1-7) produces its actions] signaling in the cells. Increased Ang-(1-7)/MasR signaling has been reported to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemia in diabetic animals. Altogether, ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis of the RAS appears to be protective in T2DM and strategies to restore ACE2 levels in the disease seem to be a promising therapy for Ang-II-mediated T2DM.", 
    "542": "Enantiomerically pure L-homophenylalanine (L-HPA) is a key building block for the synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other chiral pharmaceuticals. Among the processes developed for the L-HPA production, biocatalytic synthesis employing phenylalanine dehydrogenase has been proven as the most promising route. However, similar to other dehydrogenase-catalyzed reactions, the viability of this process is markedly affected by insufficient substrate loading and high costs of the indispensable cofactors. In the present work, a highly efficient and economic biocatalytic process for L-HPA was established by coupling genetically modified phenylalanine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. Combination of fed-batch substrate addition and a continuous product removal greatly increased substrate loading and cofactor utilization. After systemic optimization, 40\u00a0g (0.22\u00a0mol) of keto acid substrate was transformed to L-HPA within 24\u00a0h and a total of 0.2\u00a0mM NAD(+) was reused effectively in eight cycles of fed-batch operation, consequently giving an average substrate concentration of 510\u00a0mM and a productivity of 84.1\u00a0g\u00a0l(-1)\u00a0day(-1) for L-HPA. The present study provides an efficient and feasible enzymatic process for the production of L-HPA and a general solution for the increase of substrate loading.", 
    "543": "Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by dilatation of the left or right ventricle, or both ventricles. The degree of myocardial dysfunction is not attributable to abnormal loading conditions. The infectious-immune theory has long been hypothesized to explain the pathogenesis of many etiologically unrecognized dilated cardiomyopathies. Inflammations followed by immune reactions, which may be excessive, in the myocardium, evoked by external triggers such as viral infections and/or autoimmune antibodies, continue insidiously, and lead to the process of cardiac remodeling with ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction. This ultimately results in dilated cardiomyopathy. Hepatitis C virus-associated heart diseases are good examples of cardiac lesions definitely induced by viral infections in humans that progress to a chronic stage through complicated immune mechanisms. Therapeutic strategies for myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy have been obtained through analyses of the acute, subacute, and chronic phases of experimental viral myocarditis in mice. The appropriate modulation of excessive immune reactions during myocarditis, rather than their complete elimination, appears to be a key option in the prevention and treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. The clinical application of an NF-\u03baB decoy and immune adsorption of IgG3 cardiac autoantibodies have been used as immunomodulating therapies and may provide novel approaches for the treatment of refractory patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Conventional therapeutic agents for chronic heart failure such as \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists in particular should be re-evaluated on the basis of their anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy.",

    "549": "Antisocial personality traits are an important topic for research. The societal cost of these behaviors encourages efforts at a better understanding of central nervous system causes. Catecholamine genes are being studied to facilitate this understanding, and some tentative findings are being reached about several of these genes. It seems that many genes play a role to produce antisocial behaviors so complexity of elucidating each gene is obvious. One conclusion that could be drawn from the current research findings is that DA2 like receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) with alleles that decrease neurotransmission are facilitatory of antisocial behaviors. DA2 like receptors cause neuronal firing to inhibit many peripheral functions through adenylyl cyclase inhibition. When these receptors are less active by genetically decreased density, lower affinity, or by low dopamine levels as final common pathways then inhibition is released and a state of disinhibition can be said to describe this state. Peripheral metabolism is increased and behavioral activation is noted. Renin is disinhibited in this setting thus allowing sympathetic nervous system activation. The fight or flight behaviors thus produced, in the extreme, would be the setting of antisocial behavior. Research validates this hypothesis. Understanding this final common pathway toward antisocial behavior should lead to better treatment for individuals with this pattern of behavior before they have caused harm to themselves and others. ACE inhibitors are well tolerated drugs used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure and would also treat antisocial behavior disorders.",

Thirty-six hypertensive CKD patients were randomly assigned to the aliskiren add-on group (n = 18) or the benazepril add-on group (n = 18). Ambulatory BP and cardiorenal function parameters were measured at baseline and 24 weeks after treatment.

Albuminuria was decreased in the aliskiren group, but not in the benazepril group. In addition, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was significantly lower in the aliskiren group than in the benazepril group after treatment. In the aliskiren group, multivariate linear regression analysis showed an association between changes in albuminuria and changes in nighttime systolic BP. Furthermore, there were associations between changes in LVMI and changes in daytime HR variability, as well as between changes in LVMI and changes in plasma aldosterone concentration.

In the EU, it is approved for use (in addition to standard optimal therapy) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity in adult patients with chronic systolic heart failure (HF) and mild symptoms. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of eplerenone in this indication and briefly summarizes its pharmacology. In the EMPHASIS-HF study, relative to placebo, the addition of eplerenone to optimal background therapy significantly reduced the risk of death from CV causes or hospitalization for HF in patients with chronic systolic HF and mild symptoms. Benefits of eplerenone therapy over placebo were also observed in several secondary outcomes, including: death from any cause or hospitalization for HF; death from any cause; hospitalization for any reason; or hospitalization for HF. Eplerenone was generally well tolerated in this study, with the most frequent adverse event being hyperkalaemia, which is a known adverse event of the drug class. Sexual adverse events (e.g. gynecomastia) occurred in <1 % of eplerenone recipients, reflecting the selectivity of eplerenone for mineralocorticoid receptors. Based on these results, European guidelines have been updated and recommend the use of an MRA to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and premature death in all patients with persisting symptoms (New York Heart Association class II-IV) and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of \u226435 %, despite treatment with ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin receptor blocker if an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated) and a \u03b2-blocker.",

Therefore, this study sought to investigate the inhibitory effect of aqueous extracts of two varieties of ginger on a key enzyme linked to hypertension (angiotensin I-converting enzyme [ACE]), and on pro-oxidants [Fe(2+) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] which have been shown to induce lipid peroxidation in the rat's isolated heart in vitro. Aqueous extracts (0.05 mg/mL) of red ginger (Zingiber officinale var. Rubra) and white ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) were prepared and the ability of the extracts to inhibit ACE along with Fe(2+)- and SNP-induced lipid peroxidation was determined in rat's heart in vitro. Results revealed that both extracts inhibited ACE in a dose-dependent manner (25-125 \u03bcg/mL). However, red ginger extract (EC50=27.5 \u03bcg/mL) had a significantly (P<.05) higher inhibitory effect on ACE than white ginger extract (EC50=87.0 \u03bcg/mL). Furthermore, incubation of the rat's heart in the presence of Fe(2+) and SNP caused a significant increase (P<.05) in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the heart homogenates, while the introduction of the ginger extracts (78-313 \u03bcg/mL) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the MDA content of the stressed heart homogenates. This suggests that the possible mechanism through which ginger exerts its antihypertensive properties may be through inhibition of ACE activity and prevention of lipid peroxidation in the heart. Furthermore, red ginger showed stronger inhibition of ACE than white ginger. Additionally, it should be noted that these protective properties of the ginger varieties could be attributed to their polyphenol contents.", 
    "610": "Although low dietary salt intake has beneficial effects on BP (blood pressure), low 24hUNa (24 h urinary sodium excretion), the most accurate estimate of dietary salt intake, is associated with increased mortality in people with diabetes. In the non-diabetic population, low salt intake is associated with increased RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) activity. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the relationship between 24hUNa, PRA (plasma renin activity), serum aldosterone and BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) in patients with diabetes. Clinical characteristics, 24hUNa, PRA, serum aldosterone and BNP were recorded in 222 consecutive patients (77% with Type 2 diabetes) attending a diabetes clinic at a tertiary hospital. The relationship between 24hUNa, serum aldosterone, PRA, BNP, urinary potassium excretion, serum potassium, serum sodium, eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), urinary albumin excretion and HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin) was examined by a multivariable regression model. Levels of 24hUNa significantly predicted serum aldosterone in a linear fashion (R\u00b2=0.20, P=0.002). In the subgroup of patients (n=46) not taking RAAS-modifying agents, this relationship was also observed (R\u00b2=0.10, P=0.03), and the effect of 24hUNa on serum aldosterone was found to be more pronounced than in the whole cohort (coefficient=-0.0014, compared with -0.0008). There was no demonstrable relationship between 24hUNa and PRA or BNP. Low 24hUNa is associated with increased serum aldosterone in people with diabetes, in the presence and absence of RAAS-modifying agents. This raises the possibility that stimulation of the RAAS may be a mechanism that contributes to adverse outcomes observed in patients with low 24hUNa.",

    "615": "Cadmium is a highly toxic metal that is present in phosphate fertilizers, and the incidence of cadmium poisoning in the general population has increased, mainly due to cigarette smoking. Once absorbed, cadmium accumulates in the tissues, causing harmful effects including high blood pressure, endothelial damage and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is known to efficiently produce oxidized low-density lipoprotein and consequently atherosclerosis, mainly in the aorta. However, the mechanisms through which endothelial damage is induced by cadmium have not been elucidated. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of this metal in the isolated aorta and the possible role of oxidative stress. Rats received 100 mg.L(-1) cadmium chloride (CdCl2) in the drinking water or distilled water alone for four weeks. The pressor effect of cadmium was followed throughout the exposure period by tail plethysmography. At the end of the fourth week, the blood cadmium content was established, and the vascular reactivity of the isolated aorta to phenylephrine, acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside was analyzed in the context of endothelium denudation and incubation with L-NAME, apocynin, losartan, enalapril, superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase. We observed an increased response to phenylephrine in cadmium-treated rats. This increase was abolished by catalase and SOD incubation. Apocynin treatment reduced the phenylephrine response in both treatment groups, but its effect was greater in cadmium-treated rats, and NOX2 expression was greater in the cadmium group. These results suggested that cadmium in blood concentrations similar to those found in occupationally exposed populations is able to stimulate NOX2 expression, contributing to oxidative stress and reducing NO bioavailability, despite enhanced eNOS expression. These findings suggest that cadmium exposure promotes endothelial damage that might contribute to inflammation, vascular injury and the development of atherosclerosis.",

Hemodynamic compensation for volume depletion seen in the perioperative period is normally mediated by the renin-angiotensin system, which is blocked by ACEI/ARA. These drugs may contribute to severe hypotension during anesthesia induction and may have contributed to the cardiac arrest seen in this patient. Additional factors such as increased intra-abdominal pressures and respiratory obstructive episodes leading to diminished venous return, as well diuretic use and the fasting state, common in the perioperative orthopedic patient, are likely to have contributed as well. Medication use may be an easily modifiable risk factor for severe hypotension and possible cardiac arrest in the perioperative setting.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations. Captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study. The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol-treated rats.

    "620": "The venom of marine cone snails is a rich source of pharmacotherapeutic compounds with striking target specificity and functional diversity. Small, disulfide-rich peptide toxins are the most well characterized active compounds in cone snail venom. However, reports on the presence of larger polypeptides have recently emerged. The majority of these studies have focused on the content of the dissected venom gland rather than the injected venom itself. Recent breakthroughs in the sensitivity of protein and nucleotide sequencing techniques allow for the exploration of the proteomic diversity of injected venom. Using mass spectrometric analysis of injected venoms of the two fish-hunting cone snails Conus purpurascens and Conus ermineus, we demonstrate the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) and endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), metalloproteases that activate potent vasoconstrictive peptides. ACE activity was confirmed in the venom of C. purpurascens and was significantly reduced in venom preincubated with the ACE inhibitor captopril. Reverse-transcription PCR demonstrated that these enzymes are expressed in the venom glands of other cone snail species with different prey preferences. These findings strongly suggest that cone snails employ compounds that cause disruption of cardiovascular function as part of their complex envenomation strategy, leading to the enhancement of neurotropic peptide toxin activity.", 
    "621": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the presence of ACE and ECE in the venom of cone snails. Identification of these vasoactive peptide-releasing proteases in the injected venoms of two fish-hunting cone snails highlights their role in envenomation and enhances our understanding of the complex hunting strategies utilized by these marine predators. Our findings on the expression of these enzymes in other cone snail species suggests an important biological role of ACE and ECE in these animals and points towards recruitment into venom from general physiological processes.", 
    "622": "Peptides with antihypertensive potency have long been attractive to the medical and food communities. However, serving as food additives, rather than therapeutic agents, peptides should have a good taste. In the present study, we explore the intrinsic relationship between the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and bitterness of short peptides in the framework of computational peptidology, attempting to find out the appropriate properties for functional food peptides with satisfactory bioactivities. As might be expected, quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling reveals a significant positive correlation between the ACE inhibition and bitterness of dipeptides, but this correlation is quite modest for tripeptides and, particularly, tetrapeptides. Moreover, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics analysis of the structural basis and energetic profile involved in ACE-peptide complexes unravels that peptides of up to 4 amino acids long are sufficient to have efficient binding to ACE, and more additional residues do not bring with substantial enhance in their ACE-binding affinity and, thus, antihypertensive capability. All of above, it is coming together to suggest that the tripeptides and tetrapeptides could be considered as ideal candidates for seeking potential functional food additives with both high antihypertensive activity and low bitterness.",

The aim of the study was to identify ACE inhibitory peptides from soy proteins using LC-MS/MS coupled with quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. Soybean protein hydrolysate digested by thermolysin showed an IC50 value of 53.6 \u03bcg/mL, decreased slightly to 51.8 \u03bcg/mL after adding pepsin, and increased to 115.6 \u03bcg/mL after adding trypsin. A total of 34 peptides were characterised from LC-MS/MS. Five novel tripeptides, IVF, LLF, LNF, LSW and LEF, with predicted IC50 values lower than 10 \u03bcM were synthesized and validated. The results showed that soybean is an excellent source of ACE inhibitory peptides.", 
    "625": "Bovine collagen was pre-treated (boiled or high pressure (HP)-treated) and then hydrolysed by 6 proteases. The degree of hydrolysis (DH) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of hydrolysates were measured. All enzymes used were able to partly degrade collagen and release ACE-inhibitory peptides. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was obtained with Alcalase. Pretreatment significantly influenced the DH and ACE-inhibition. For most enzymes, boiling for 5 min resulted in a significantly higher DH and ACE-inhibitory activity. With Alcalase and collagenase, hydrolysis and release of ACE-inhibitory peptides occurred without any pretreatment, but HP-treatment significantly improved the DH and ACE-inhibitory activity. HP did not markedly affect the hydrolysis with the other enzymes. The major peptides obtained with Alcalase were identified; all were released from the triple helix structure of collagen. Many of these peptides had C-terminal sequences similar to known ACE-inhibitory peptides. The present results suggest that collagen-rich food materials are good substrates for the release of potent ACE-inhibitory peptides, when proper pre-treatment and enzymatic treatment is applied.",

A determination was made of the activity of the peptide inhibitors of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), and the antiradical and ion chelating activity of peptides from different protein fractions. The highest peptide levels after the absorption process (<7 kDa) were noted in the albumin fraction (50.69 \u03bcg/ml). Furthermore, it was found that peptides from the prolamin fraction were characterised by the highest antiradical activity and ACE inhibitory activity (IC50=0.17 mg/ml). Peptides obtained from the globulin fraction showed the highest ability to chelate iron ions, and peptides from the glutelin fraction were characterised as being the most effective in the chelation of copper ions.",

It can manifest itself as hypertensive emergency (HE) or hypertensive urgency (HU), which is usually accompanied with levels of diastolic BP \u2265120 mmHg. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism may influence manifestations of HC. Thus, this study evaluated the influence of ACE I/D polymorphism in individuals with HC. A total of 187 patients admitted with HC (HU [n=69] and HE [n=118]) and 75 normotensive individuals were included in the study. Peripheral blood was drawn for a biochemical and genetic analysis of the ACE I/D polymorphism by Polymerase Chain Reaction. HC group showed higher systolic BP, body mass index (BMI), glycemia, creatinine, and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared with normotensive individuals. The use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers was more frequent in the HU group than in the HE group (p=0.020). The II genotype was more predominant in normotensive and HU individuals than among HE individuals (18.7%, 11.6%, and 2.5%, respectively; p=0.004). Higher BMI and glycemia were associated with HC in the logistic regression model. ACE II genotype (odds ratio [OR] 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.51) and HDL cholesterol were protective for the development of HE. ACE II genotype was present in the HU group, compared with the HE group (OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.04-0.88). This study shows an association between the low prevalence of ACE I/D polymorphism II genotype and a greater occurrence of HE in Brazilian individuals. The lower blockage of RAS, which was detected in the HE group, may interact with the low frequency of II genotype, conferring an increased risk for HE.",

Characterizing the zofenoprilat downstream effector we found that zofenoprilat reverted the SirT-1 downregulation induced by angiotensin II. p38 activation by angiotensin II was strictly correlated with SirT1 protein downregulation; SB203580 significantly prevented SirT1 downregulation induced by angiotensin II while the p38 constitutive activation abolished SIRT1 protein basal levels. p38 directly bound SirT1 sequestering it in the cytoplasm.

In small studies, ARB and ACE inhibitor combinations were shown to be beneficial in patients with CV or renal disease, with improvement in surrogate markers. However, in larger outcome trials, involving combinations of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or DRIs, dual RAS inhibition did not show reduction in mortality in patients with diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease or after myocardial infarction, and was in fact, associated with increased harm. A recent meta-analysis of all major trials conducted over the past 22 years involving dual RAS inhibition has clearly shown that the risk-benefit ratio argues against the use of dual RAS inhibition.

The overarching goal in caring for patients with T2DM is to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications with glycemic control. Several studies such as UKPDS, DCCT, and EDIC have been performed to evaluate the effects of glucose control on tissue complications in patients with diabetes. In recent diabetes trials including ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT, BARI 2D, and ORIGIN, intensive glucose control did not prevent macrovascular complications in older patients with long-standing diabetes with either cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In fact, intensive therapy was associated with increased mortality in the ACCORD trial. Although no clear macrovascular benefit was seen in these trials, analyses of earlier studies in younger patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have suggested a significant benefit of intensive glycemic control in patients with a shorter duration of diabetes and less vasculopathy. In the UKPDS, the incidence of microvascular disease, particularly retinopathy, was reduced significantly with intensive glucose control, but in the more recent trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT, ORIGIN) the benefit was relatively modest and limited to reduced proteinuria. Perhaps the most important message from the above trials is to optimize control of cardiovascular risk factors.

In contrast, oxidation reduction, oxygen transport, defense systems response to pollutant, protein biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis were upregulated in phenanthrene-treated E. fetida. In addition, ATP synthase b subunit, lysenin-related protein 2, lombricine kinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actinbinding protein, and extracellular globin-4 seem to be potential biomarkers since these biomarker were able to low levels (2.5 mg kg(-1)) of phenanthrene.

Although there is good evidence for the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the treatment for HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is not well defined. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been shown to be an effective target in the treatment of HFrEF using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone blockade, although the evidence in HFpEF is less clear. This review aims to look first at the evidence for these drugs, and second at the newer drugs that act on the RAAS, namely, direct renin inhibitors, neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, vasopeptidase inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers.",

For purposes of this study, anti-chronic heart failure drugs were separated into categories: mortality reducing agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, spironolactone, hydralazine plus nitrates) and symptom-relieving agents (digoxin, diuretics). Thereafter, the trends of prescription patterns related to different physician specialties were analyzed.",

In the metabolic syndrome (MS), ventricular stiffness is additionally increased in a later stage. It is unknown whether this is related to intrinsic cardiomyocyte dysfunction, extrinsic factors influencing cardiomyocyte contractility and/or cardiac function, or a combination of both. A first aim was to study cardiomyocyte contractility and Ca2+ handling in vitro in a mouse model of MS. A second aim was to investigate whether in vivo hypocaloric diet or ACE-inhibition (ACE-I) improved cardiomyocyte contractility in vitro, contractile reserve and Ca2+ handling.",

Both conditions incur significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the prognosis of COPD and HF combined is poorer than for either disease alone. Nevertheless, usually only one of them is diagnosed. An active search for each condition using clinical examination and additional tests including plasma natriuretic peptides, lung function testing, and echocardiography should be obtained. The combination of COPD and HF presents many therapeutic challenges. The beneficial effects of selective \u03b21-blockers should not be denied in stable patients who have HF and coexisting COPD. Additionally, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers may reduce the morbidity and mortality of COPD patients. Moreover, caution is advised with use of inhaled \u03b22-agonists for the treatment of COPD in patients with HF. Finally, noninvasive ventilation, added to conventional therapy, improves the outcome of patients with acute respiratory failure due to hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD or HF in situations of acute pulmonary edema. The establishment of a combined and integrated approach to managing these comorbidities would seem an appropriate strategy. Additional studies providing new data on the pathogenesis and management of patients with COPD and HF are needed, with the purpose of trying to improve quality of life as well as survival of these patients.",

Coinfusion of an ACE inhibitor, enalapril, ablated angiotensin I-augmented atherosclerosis but had no effect on angiotensin II-induced lesion development. ACE protein was detected in several cell types in atherosclerotic lesions, with a predominance in macrophages. This cell type secreted angiotensin II, which was ablated by ACE inhibition. To study whether leukocyte ACE contributed to atherosclerosis, irradiated male low-density lipoprotein receptor(-/-) mice were repopulated with bone marrow-derived cells from either ACE(+/+) or ACE(-/-) mice and fed the fat-enriched diet for 12 weeks.

Different groups of recommended drugs are discussed separately; possible risks for elderly patients are stressed. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors-this group is widely used in older patients because of their hypotensive effect, positive influence on cardiac failure, and positive modulation of endothelial dysfunction. The risk of hyperkalemia must be considered. Antiaggregants and anticoagulants are proved as potent prophylactic treatment, but the associated risk of gastrointestinal bleeding must be weighed very carefully. Bradycardia related to \u03b2-blockers, especially in combination with other medications lowering the heart rate must be taken into account. Otherwise, this group brings the highest profit in cardiovascular diseases as for morbidity and mortality. Attention is paid to calcium channel blockers, statins, diuretics, nitrates, and digoxin.

Most (90% active) but not all (10% inactive) E. faecalis strains produced BSM-derived hydrolysates with high ACE-IA. Known ACE-inhibitory peptides (ACE-IP) and an antioxidant peptide were identified in the E. faecalis hydrolysates by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-MS/MS). Antimicrobial activity against Pediococcus damnosus CECT4797 and Listeria ivanovii CECT913 was also observed in the E. faecalis hydrolysates. The incidence of virulence factors in the E. faecalis strains with ACE-IA and producers of ACE-IP was variable but less virulence factors were observed in the food and environmental strains than in the clinical reference strains. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based analysis demonstrated that food and environmental E. faecalis strains were genetically different from those of clinical origin. When evaluated, most E. faecalis strains of clinical origin also originated BSM-derived hydrolysates with high ACE-IA due to the production of ACE-IP. Accordingly, the results of this work suggest that most E. faecalis strains of food, environmental and clinical origin produce BSM-derived bioactive peptides with human health connotations and potential biotechnological applications.",

    "706": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of hematologic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that results in reduced blood counts. Although MDS can transform into leukemia, most of the morbidity experienced by these patients is due to chronically low blood counts. Conventional cytotoxic agents used to treat MDS have yielded some encouraging results but are characterized by many adverse effects in the predominantly elderly patient population. Targeted interventions aimed at reversing the bone marrow failure and increasing the peripheral blood counts would be advantageous in this cohort of patients. Studies have demonstrated over-activated signaling of myelo-suppressive cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and Interferons in MDS hematopoietic stem cells. Targeting these signaling cascades could be potentially therapeutic in MDS. The p38 MAP kinase pathway, which is constitutively activated in MDS, is an example of cytokine stimulated kinase that promotes aberrant apoptosis of stem and progenitor cells in MDS. ARRY-614 and SCIO-469 are p38 MAPK inhibitors that have been used in clinical trials and have shown activity in a subset of MDS patients. TGF-\u03b2 signaling has been therapeutically targeted by small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase, LY-2157299, with encouraging preclinical results. Apart from TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase inhibition, members of TGF-\u03b2 super family and BMP ligands have also been targeted by ligand trap compounds like Sotatercept (ACE-011) and ACE-536. The multikinase inhibitor, ON-01910.Na (Rigosertib) has demonstrated early signs of efficacy in reducing the percentage of leukemic blasts and is in advanced stages of clinical testing. Temsirolimus, Deforolimus and other mTOR inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials and have shown preclinical efficacy in CMML. EGF receptor inhibitors, Erlotinib and Gefitinib have shown efficacy in small trials that may be related to off target effects. Cell cycle regulator inhibitors such as Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (Tipifarnib, Lonafarnib) and MEK inhibitor (GSK1120212) have shown acceptable toxicity profiles in small studies and efforts are underway to select mutational subgroups of MDS and AML that may benefit from these inhibitors. Altogether, these studies show that targeting various signal transduction pathways that regulate hematopoiesis offers promising therapeutic potential in this disease.

Moreover, anthracycline administration significantly up-regulated heart PPAR\u03b1 mRNA and its expression remained increased after ACEi co-administration. On the other hand, the expression of cardiac PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 was not altered in anthracycline-treated animals, whereas co-administration of ACEi increased its expression. Conclusively, effect of ACEi can be already detected in sub-acute phase of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Altered expression of heart PPARs may suggest these nuclear receptors as a novel target in anthracycline cardiomyopathy.",

While asymptomatic, the presence and progression of silent brain infarcts and white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging are associated with an increased risk of future strokes. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are recommended for the primary and secondary prevention of stroke, but there are no direct comparisons of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus angiotensin II receptor blockers regarding their cerebroprotective effects, including their effect on asymptomatic cerebral lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging.",

We selected all patients from the IADB who were incident users of both ACEi and nitrofurantoin (a proxy for UTIs). A relatively short maximum time-span of 4 weeks between both prescriptions was used to limit time-variant confounding. The sequence ratio was calculated by dividing the number of individuals starting ACEi first and nitrofurantoin second by the number of individuals starting nitrofurantoin treatment first and ACEi second. We adjusted for trends in prescribing and estimated 95 % confidence intervals using exact confidence intervals for binomial distributions. To evaluate whether the effect is specific to ACEi and to assess whether the possible mechanism behind an increased risk of UTIs is related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, we also estimated the risk for \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers).",

The method is based on pre-column derivatization of captopril and 2-propene-1-thiol (internal standard) with a new reagent 2-naphthyl propiolate. Sample clean-up, derivatization and extraction were carried out in two steps, totally less than 30min. The extracts were chromatographed on a C18 column (5\u03bcm, 150mm\u00d74.6mmi.d.). The mobile phase consisted of methanol (75%, v/v) and phosphate buffer (25%, pH=8, 0.01M). UV detection was performed at 290nm. To obtain the best reaction yield, the factors that could influence the derivatization process, including the concentration of derivatization reagent, pH of sample solution and temperature were investigated in detail and optimized using Box-Behnken response surface methodology. Under optimized conditions the average extraction recovery of captopril and internal standard were >86%. The achieved lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 3ng/mL; the assay exhibited a linear dynamic range of 3-2000ng/mL with correlation coefficient (r(2)) of \u22650.99. The precision was satisfactory in the whole calibration range with RSD of 5.9-12.4% (accuracy: from 97.5% to 93.6%) and of 6.4-12.8% (accuracy: from 97.3% to 95.2%) for intra- and inter-assay, respectively. The method stability was confirmed in a series of experiments including: freeze-thaw, short- and long-term stability testing.

Thirty-one subjects (56%) showed an increase in TRV, while 24 subjects (44%) showed no change or a decrease in TRV. A linear mixed effects model indicated an overall rate of increase in the TRV of 0\u00b702 m/s per year (P = 0\u00b7023). The model showed that treatment with hydroxycarbamide was associated with an initial TRV that was 0\u00b720 m/s lower than no such treatment (P = 0\u00b7033), while treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers was associated with an increase in the TRV (P = 0\u00b7006). In summary, although some patients have clinically meaningful increases, the overall rate of TRV increase is slow. Treatment with hydroxycarbamide may decrease the progression of TRV. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal frequency of screening echocardiography and the effect of therapeutic interventions on the progression of TRV in SCD.",

To support physicians in everyday care of elderly patients with hypertension, new guidelines were issued in Poland at the end of 2012. In 2013, the guidelines started to be implemented into practice. The aim of this article is to present an overview of the major recommendations included in these 2013 guidelines. Physicians should be aware of the key issues specific for the care of the elderly hypertensive population. Lowering blood pressure below 150/90 mmHg should be considered as the goal of therapy in hypertensive patients older than 80 years. Slight overweight (body mass index, 27-28 kg/m2) may be beneficial for patients older than 75 years and especially for octogenarians because it may prevent protein and calorie deficiency. Thiazide-like diuretics followed by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, if needed, should be considered as a first-line therapy for hypertensive patients older than 80 years. Because of high risk of adverse effects, the pharmacological treatment of hypertension in the elderly should be started with lower doses of blood pressure-lowering agents, and treatment intensification should be careful. The guidelines on hypertension management were developed by 3 medical societies and specialists from different medical fields. The Delphi method was used to achieve consensus on controversial issues.",

In particular, neutral endopeptidase (NEP) has been shown to play critical roles in the metabolism of the endogenous peptides Met- and Leu-enkephalins. In this study, we have evaluated the activity of a new fluorinated peptidase inhibitor NESS002ie in both in vitro and in vivo assays. NESS002ie has been compared to the peptidomimetic compound thiorphan and the previously reported NEP selective thiol inhibitor C20. The metallopeptidases inhibitory activity of NESS002ie was tested in vitro using a highly, sensitive, continuous, fluorometric, enzyme assay. Also, the analgesic propriety of NESS002ie, thiorphan and C20 have been evaluated in vivo, by intraplantar, intravenous and intrathecal administration, through nociception assays based on formalin test in mice. Metallopeptidases assays have shown an inhibitory potency of NESS002ie in the nanomolar range for NEP and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The new fluorinated inhibitor showed higher analgesic activity and bioavailability compared to thiorphan and C20 when administered by both intravenous and intrathecal injections. More significantly, intrathecal injection of NESS002ie reduced both the first and the second phases of the formalin biphasic pain response. In addition, naltrindole and naloxone reversed the analgesic effect of NESS002ie with a diverse profile. This study shows an improvement in relief of inflammation and pain, in vivo, using NESS002ie compared to reference compounds thiorphan and C20. This significant effect could be due to the replacement of isobutyl chain of the thiol C20 with the trifluoromethyl group.",

The current guidelines for secondary prevention have focused on lifestyle modifications, risk factor control, and drug therapy. However, current data lack information on the United States population and its adherence to these guidelines. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2010, we identified those with CHD and assessed the adequacy of their adherence to the current guidelines for secondary prevention. Of 759 subjects with CHD (weighted to 12.7 million), the use of recommended therapies was 55%, 45%, and 62% for \u03b2 blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and lipid-lowering agents, respectively (24% for all), with adherence lower in women than in men and in blacks and Hispanics than in whites. The nonsmoking status and control of blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and, for those with diabetes, glycated hemoglobin was 73%, 67%, 59%, 60%, respectively (14% for all). Also, 17%, 70%, and 7% were at the recommended levels for physical activity, alcohol consumption, and sodium intake, respectively. Moreover, only 20% and 29% were at the recommended body mass index and waist circumference targets, respectively. Those with metabolic syndrome and diabetes were more likely to have \u22652 risk factors uncontrolled, despite being more likely to be receiving recommended therapies. A\u00a0significant gap still exists between the secondary prevention guidelines and their adherence and control of CHD risk factors among United States adults. In conclusion, greater efforts are needed to ensure adherence to all aspects of secondary prevention guidelines to optimize the prognosis in subjects with CHD.", 
    "761": "To assess the difference of pre- and post-training performance evaluation of continuing medical education (CME) courses in cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) management among physicians at primary health care facilities of Armenian regions we conducted an evaluation survey. 212 medical records were surveyed on assessment of performance before and after the training courses through a self-employed structured questionnaire. Analysis of survey revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in a number of variables: threefold increased recording of lipids and body mass index (p = 0.001); moderate increased recording of comorbidities and aspirin prescription (p < 0.012); eightfold increased recording of dyslipidemia management plan, twofold increased recording for CVD management plan and fivefold increased recording for CVD absolute risk (p = 0.000). Missing records of electrocardiography and urine/creatinine analyses decreased statistically significantly (p < 0.05). Statistically significant decrease was observed in prescription of thiazides and angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (p < 0.005), while prescription of statins and statins with diet for dyslipidemia management showed increased recording (p < 0.05). Similarly, we observed increased records for counseling of rehabilitation physical activity (p = 0.006). In this survey most differences in pre- and post-evaluation of performance assessment may be explained by improved and interactive training modes, more advanced methods of demonstration of modeling. Current findings may serve a basis for future planning of CME courses for physicians of remote areas facing challenges in upgrading their knowledge, as well as expand the experience of performance assessment along with evaluation of knowledge scores.",

We studied the Ang-(1-12) and Ang II responses in COS-7 cells or CHO cells transfected with 5\u00a0\u03bcg AT1R by monitoring [Ca(2+)]i using the Fluo-4. Ang II (1\u00a0pM-1\u00a0\u03bcM) and Ang-(1-12) (5\u00a0pM-5\u00a0\u03bcM) increased [Ca(2+)]i with an EC50 of 0.19\u00a0nM and 24\u00a0nM in COS-7 cells; and 0.65\u00a0nM and 28.7\u00a0nM in CHO cells. The AT1R antagonist losartan (1\u00a0nM-10\u00a0\u03bcM) suppressed [Ca(2+)]i induced by Ang-(1-12) and Ang II. In CHO cells transfected with 5\u00a0\u03bcg AT2R, Ang II (1 pM-1\u00a0\u03bcM) increased [Ca(2+)]i, with an EC50 of 9.68\u00a0nM; whereas, Ang-(1-12) (5\u00a0pM-5\u00a0\u03bcM) failed to elicit a significant change in [Ca(2+)]i. In CHO cells transfected with AT1R, Ang-(1-12) stimulated ERK phosphorylation with a potency 300-fold less than that of Ang II. To evaluate the activity of Ang-(1-12) on native AT1R, whole cell patch recordings were made from neurons in the rat hypothalamic slices. Ang II or Ang-(1-12) ejected by pressure from a micropipette elicited a membrane depolarization; the latter was blocked by losartan (10\u00a0\u03bcM), and not affected by the AT2R antagonist PD123319 (10\u00a0\u03bcM), nor by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (10\u00a0\u03bcM).

Methods. 33 Goiter patients were enrolled versus 25 age-matched controls. TSH levels, size of thyroid gland, and presence or absence of thyroid nodules were reported. Subjects were asked about the presence or absence of any of the following symptoms: cough, globus pharyngeus, and/or throat clearing that persistented for more than 6 weeks. The presence of one or more of these symptoms for at least six weeks in the absence of LPRD, allergy, asthma, ACE inhibitor intake, and psychogenic disorder was defined as LSN. Results. For goitrous patients mean age (years) was (41.73 \u00b1 9.47) versus (37.44 \u00b1 10.89) for controls. 82% goitrous patients had known nodules and 27% carried a simultaneous diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

The overall prevalence of LSN among goitrous patients was 42% versus 12% among controls (P = 0.0187). There was no correlation between LSN, size of thyroid gland, and TSH level. Conclusion. The prevalence of LSN in goitrous patients is significantly higher than that in a nongoitrous population.", 
    "774": "Antitumor drugs may cause asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction that introduces a lifetime risk of heart failure or myocardial infarction. Cardio-oncology is the discipline committed to the cardiac surveillance and management of cancer patients and survivors; however, cardio-oncology teams do not always attempt to treat early diastolic dysfunction. Common cardiovascular drugs, such as \u03b2 blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or others, would be of uncertain efficacy in diastolic dysfunction. This perspective describes the potential value of ranolazine, an antianginal drug that improves myocardial perfusion by relieving diastolic wall tension and dysfunction. Ranolazine acts by inhibiting the late inward sodium current, and pharmacological reasonings anticipate that antitumor anthracyclines and nonanthracycline chemotherapeutics might well induce anomalous activation of this current. These notions formed the rationale for a clinical study of the efficacy and safety of ranolazine in cancer patients. This study was not designed to demonstrate that ranolazine reduced the lifetime risk of cardiac events; it was designed as a short term proof-of-concept study that probed the following hypotheses: 1) asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction could be detected a few days after patients completed antitumor therapy, and 2) ranolazine was active and safe in relieving echocardiographic and/or biohumoral indices of diastolic dysfunction, measured at 5 weeks or 6 months of ranolazine administration. These facts illustrate the translational value of pharmacology, which goes from identifying therapeutic opportunities to validating hypotheses in clinical settings. Pharmacology is a key to the success of cardio-oncology.",

This hospital-based single-center prospective open-label randomized case-control interventional study was performed to evaluate and compare the native drug Dioscorea bulbifera with fosinopril in the management of diabetic nephropathy. Patients with diabetic nephropathy with proteinuria >500 mg/day or albuminuria >300 mg/ day, S Cr \u22642.5 mg/dL and hypertension controlled with a single drug were included into the study and were divided into three groups according to the interventional drugs that they were given; group A (n = 46) on fosinopril (5-40 mg/day), group B (n = 45) on Dioscorea bulbifera (500 mg BD) and group C (n = 46) on neither of these drugs. All necessary laboratory investigations needed to assess the effect of both the drugs were carried out. Patients were followed-up for six months. The study included 137 patients (M:F 2.61:1) with an age range of 19-76 years. At the sixth-month follow-up, a significant decrease in the systolic blood pressure was noted in all three groups whereas the diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly only in group B. There was significantly better control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in group B than in the other groups. Although fasting blood sugar was poorly controlled in the initial visit in all three groups, there was a significant decrease at the sixth-month follow-up in all three groups. Moreover, the decrease was significantly more pronounced in group B than in the other two groups. Low-density lipoprotein decreased significantly only in group B. Proteinuria, serum transforming growth factor-\u03b2, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein decreased in both group A and group B, more so in the latter, but the differences between the groups were not statistically significant. Importantly, proteinuria and serum IL-6 showed an increasing trend in group C. It can be concluded that Dioscorea bulbifera was more effective than fosinopril in controlling blood pressure, glycemia, cholesterolemia and inflammatory state in diabetic nephropathy. Both agents decreased proteinuria. However, creatinine clearance significantly decreased with both the drugs, more so with Dioscera, and thus further evaluation with a larger trial is needed.",

    "784": "Hypertension is a major risk factor in addition to atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus for the development of coronary heart disease and strokes. Several prospective clinical studies have demonstrated a possible protective effect of milk and dairy product consumption on these conditions. The putative effects of milk and dairy products are possibly mediated through their mineral content of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin D. These dairy substances exercise their blood pressure-lowering effect either directly on the arterial wall by these minerals or indirectly through blockade of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by the amino acids contained in the casein and whey of milk. The blockade of ACE results in the inhibition of production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictive peptide, and the prevention of degradation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilating peptide. For this concise review, a Medline search of the English language literature was conducted from 2006 to September 2012 and 16 pertinent papers were selected. The potential beneficial pleiotropic effects from these studies together with collateral literature will be discussed in this review.",

This study tests the hypothesis that the addition of nebivolol in predominantly African American patients with type 2 diabetes already receiving maximally tolerated doses of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers will further improve large artery compliance. Patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension on maximal RAS blockade (n=70) were randomized to nebivolol or metoprolol succinate daily. Doses were titrated until systolic blood pressure (SBP) was <130\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg. Radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave velocity (PWV) analysis were used to derive central aortic pressures and hemodynamic indices at repeated visits at intervals during a 6-month period. Both metoprolol succinate and nebivolol groups demonstrated reductions in brachial SBP (-8.2\u00b14.3\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [P=.01] and -7.8\u00b13.7 [P=.002], respectively) and aortic DBP (-2.4\u00b11.8 [P=.039] and -4.0\u00b12.9\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [P=.013], respectively). Aortic SBP decreased in the nebivolol group only (125.3\u00b18 to 121.6\u00b18.2, P=.025). There were no between group differences in aortic SBP, DBP, augmentation index, or PWV reduction. A significant increase in hemoglobin A1c was observed only in the metoprolol group. In patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension treated with maximally tolerated RAS blockade, nebivolol does not offer significant reductions in aortic BP over metoprolol succinate but maintains a stable metabolic profile.",

    "787": "Angiotensin-(1-12) [ANG-(1-12)], a new member of the renin-angiotensin system, is recognized as a renin independent precursor for ANG II. However, the processing of ANG-(1-12) in the circulation in vivo is not fully established. We examined the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase inhibition on angiotensin peptides formation during an intravenous infusion of ANG-(1-12) in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). WKY and SHR were assigned to a short ANG-(1-12) infusion lasting 5, 15, 30, or 60 min (n = 4-10 each group). In another experiment WKY and SHR were assigned to a continuous 15-min ANG-(1-12) infusion with pretreatment of saline, lisinopril (10 mg/kg), or chymostatin (10 mg/kg) (n = 7-13 each group). Saline or lisinopril were infused intravenously 15 min before the administration of ANG-(1-12) (2 nmol\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)), whereas chymostatin was given by bolus intraperitoneal injection 30 min before ANG-(1-12). Infusion of ANG-(1-12) increased arterial pressure and plasma ANG-(1-12), ANG I, ANG II, and ANG-(1-7) levels in WKY and SHR. Pretreatment with lisinopril caused increase in ANG-(1-12) and ANG I and large decreases in ANG II compared with the other two groups in both strains. Pretreatment of chymostatin had no effect on ANG-(1-12), ANG I, and ANG II levels in both strains, whereas it increased ANG-(1-7) levels in WKY. We conclude that ACE acts as the primary enzyme for the conversion of ANG-(1-12) to smaller angiotensin peptides in the circulation of WKY and SHR and that chymase may be an ANG-(1-7) degrading enzyme.",

Enhanced oxidative stress and the subsequent cleavage of the nursing hormone Prolactin into an anti-angiogenic 16\u00a0kDa subfragment emerged as a potential causal factor of the disease. We established a prospective registry with confirmed PPCM present in 115 patients (mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF: 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0%). Follow-up data (6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0months) showed LVEF improvement in 85\u00a0% and full recovery in 47\u00a0% while 15\u00a0% failed to recover with death in 2\u00a0% of patients. A positive family history of cardiomyopathy was present in 16.5\u00a0%. Pregnancy-associated hypertension was associated with a better outcome while a baseline LVEF\u00a0\u2264\u00a025\u00a0% was associated with a worse outcome. A high recovery rate (96\u00a0%) was observed in patients obtaining combination therapy with beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor-blockers (ARBs) and bromocriptine. Increased serum levels of Cathepsin D, the enzyme that generates 16\u00a0kDa Prolactin, miR-146a, a direct target of 16\u00a0kDa Prolactin, N-terminal-pro-brain-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) emerged as biomarkers for PPCM. In conclusion, low baseline LVEF is a predictor for poor outcome while pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders are associated with a better outcome in this European PPCM cohort. The high recovery rate in this collective is associated with a treatment concept using beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs and bromocriptine. Increased levels of Cathepsin D activity, miR-146a and ADMA in serum of PPCM patients support the pathophysiological role of 16\u00a0kDa Prolactin for PPCM and may be used as a specific diagnostic marker profile.",

Expansion of renal cysts causing local renal ischemia and activation of the reninangiotensin system is believed to play a decisive role in its pathogenesis. Hypertension in ADPKD leads to early development of left ventricle hypertrophy and definitely contributes to the progression of chronic renal insufficiency. In ADPKD optimal control of blood pressure dramatically decreases the risk of left ventricle hypertrophy and contributes to its regression, but the beneficial effect of optimal compared to standard blood pressure control on the progression of chronic renal insufficiency has yet to be unequivocally demonstrated. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/\u200aor angiotensin receptor blockers are the drugs of choice in the treatment of hypertension in ADPKD. New drugs blocking the growth of renal cysts (e. g. inhibitors of V2 vasopressin antagonists) may have in ADPKD positive impact not only of the growth of the cysts and kidney volume, but also on the rate of loss of glomerular filtration rate.

    "812": "Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), an angioproliferative disorder, has a viral etiology and a multifactorial pathogenesis hinged on an immune dysfunction. The disease is multifocal, with a course ranging from indolent, with only skin manifestations to fulminant, with extensive visceral involvement. In the current view, all forms of KS have a common etiology in human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 infection, and the differences among them are due to the involvement of various cofactors. In fact, HHV-8 infection can be considered a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of KS, because further factors (genetic, immunologic, and environmental) are required. The role of cofactors can be attributed to their ability to interact with HHV-8, to affect the immune system, or to act as vasoactive agents. In this contribution, a survey of the current state of knowledge on many and various factors involved in KS pathogenesis is carried out, in particular by highlighting the facts and controversies about the role of some drugs (quinine analogues and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) in the onset of the disease. Based on these assessments, it is possible to hypothesize that the role of cofactors in KS pathogenesis can move toward an effect either favoring or inhibiting the onset of the disease, depending on the presence of other agents modulating the pathogenesis itself, such as genetic predisposition, environmental factors, drug intake, or lymph flow disorders. It is possible that the same agents may act as either stimulating or inhibiting cofactors according to the patient's genetic background and variable interactions. Treatment guidelines for each form of KS are outlined, because a unique standard therapy for all of them cannot be considered due to KS heterogeneity. In most cases, therapeutic options, both local and systemic, should be tailored to the patient's peculiar clinical conditions.",

On final dose of lisinopril 20 mg/day, protein-creatinine ratio declined to 0.33 within 10 months. We propose the hypothesis that development of FSGS in NF1 may be mediated by activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways secondary to up-regulation of ras proteins due to deficient neurofibromin. Since mTOR signaling pathway is partially mediated through angiotensin-II activation, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may serve as an effective initial treatment beyond anti-proteinuric properties of ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "814": "Kidney damage represents a frequent event in the course of hypertension, ranging from a benign to a malignant form of nephropathy depending on several factors, that is, individual susceptibility, degree of hypertension, type of etiology and underlying kidney disease. Multiple mechanisms are involved in determination of kidney glomerular, tubular and interstitial injuries in hypertension. The present review article discusses relevant contributory molecular mechanisms underpinning the promotion of hypertensive renal damage, such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and genetic and epigenetic determinants. We highlighted major pathways involved in the progression of inflammation and fibrosis leading to glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, thus providing a state of the art review of the pathogenetic background useful for a better understanding of current and future therapeutic strategies toward hypertensive nephropathy. An adequate control of high blood pressure, obtained through an appropriate therapeutic intervention, still represents the key strategy to achieve a satisfactory control of renal damage in hypertension. In this regard, we reviewed the impact of currently available antihypertensive pharmacological treatment on kidney damage, with particular regard to RAAS inhibitors. Notably, recent findings underscored the ability of the kidneys to regenerate and to repair tissue injuries through the differentiation of resident embryonic stem cells. Pharmacological modulation of the renal endogenous reparative process (that is, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 angiotensin II receptor blockers), as well as future therapeutic strategies targeted to the renopoietic system, offers interesting perspectives for the management of hypertensive nephropathy.", 
    "815": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide health problem. The disease is most often progressive of nature with a high impact on patients and society. It is increasingly recognized that CKD can be detected in the early stages and should be managed as early as possible. Treatment of the cause, but in particular control of the main risk markers, such as high blood pressure, glucose and albuminuria, has been instrumental in delaying the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, despite the state of the art therapy, the absolute risk of renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD patients remains devastatingly high. Novel drugs are therefore highly desirable to halt effectively the progressive renal (and cardiovascular) function loss. Recently, several novel strategies have been tested targeting traditional risk factors such as blood pressure (combination therapy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and novel mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as well as dyslipidaemia (statins) with surprising results. In addition, drug targets specifically related to the kidney, such as vitamin D, uric acid, erythropoietin and phosphate, have been the subject of clinical trials, in some instances with unexpected results. Finally, novel targets including endothelin receptors and inflammatory pathways are increasingly explored as potential avenues to improve renal and cardiovascular protection, albeit that the drugs tested have not been unequivocally successful. In this article we review novel drugs or intervention strategies for the management of CKD, we try to provide explanations for the failure of some promising drugs and hypothesize on the potential success of new strategies.", 
    "816": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a significant feature of atherosclerosis but the impact of ROS on atherogenesis is not clear since antioxidants such as vitamin E have little effect on atherosclerosis development in vivo. To investigate the role of ROS in atherosclerosis, we used ApoE-deficient mice, and compared the treatment effect of the antioxidant vitamin E with that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, because angiotensin II is a major source of ROS in the vasculature. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining demonstrated that vitamin E and captopril both prevented the atherosclerosis-induced increase in aortic superoxide content. In contrast, seven months of vitamin E treatment retarded the development of atherosclerotic lesions by only 45.8 \u00b1 11.5% whereas captopril reduced the aortic plaque area by 88.1 \u00b1 7.5%. To discriminate between vitamin E-sensitive and -insensitive effects of ACE inhibition, we performed whole genome microarray gene expression profiling. Gene ontology (GO) and immunohistology analyses showed that vitamin E and captopril prevented atherosclerosis-related changes of aortic intima and media genes. However, vitamin E did not reduce the expression of probe sets detecting the aortic recruitment of pro-inflammatory immune cells while immune cell-specific genes were normalized by captopril treatment. Moreover, vitamin E did not prevent the atherosclerosis-dependent down-regulation of perivascular nerve-specific genes, which were preserved in captopril-treated aortas. Taken together, our study detected antioxidant vitamin E-like effects of angiotensin II inhibition in atherosclerosis treatment regarding preservation of aortic intima and media genes. Additional vitamin E-insensitive effects targeting atherosclerosis-enhancing aortic immune cell recruitment and perivascular nerve degeneration could account for the stronger anti-atherogenic activity of ACE inhibition compared to vitamin E.",

This study investigated the effects of RAS blockade on liver macrophages (Kupffer cells; KCs) in an orthotopic murine model of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases. Here we showed that pharmacological targeting of the RAS [ANG II (31.25 \u00b5g/kg/h i.p.), ANG-(1-7) (24 \u00b5g/kg/h i.p.) or the ACE inhibitor; captopril (750 mg/kg/d i.p.)] altered endogenous KC numbers in the tumor-bearing liver throughout metastatic growth. Captopril, and to a lesser extent ANG-(1-7), increased KC numbers in the liver but not tumor. KCs were found to express the key RAS components: ACE and AT1R. Treatment with captopril and ANG II increased the number of AT1R-expressing KCs, although total KC numbers were not affected by ANG II. Captopril (0.1 \u00b5M) also increased macrophage invasion in vitro. Additionally, captopril was administered with KC depletion before tumor induction (day 0) or at established metastatic growth (day 18) using gadolinium chloride (GdCl 3; 20 mg/kg). Livers were collected at day 21 and quantitative stereology used as a measure of tumor burden. Captopril reduced growth of CRC liver metastases. However, when captopril was combined with early KC depletion (day 0) tumor growth was significantly increased compared with captopril alone. In contrast, late KC depletion (day 18) failed to influence the anti-tumor effects of captopril. The result of these studies suggests that manipulation of the RAS can alter KC numbers and may subsequently influence progression of CRC liver metastases.",

For standard regression models, a proportional interactions model first described by Follmann and Proschan (1999) offers a powerful approach for identifying effect modification in a randomized clinical trial when multiple variables influence treatment response. In this paper, we present a framework for using the proportional interactions model in the context of a parallel-arm clinical trial with multiple prespecified candidate effect modifiers. To protect against model misspecification, we propose a selection strategy that considers all possible proportional interactions models. We develop a modified Bonferroni correction for multiple testing that accounts for the positive correlation among candidate models. We describe methods for constructing a confidence interval for the proportionality parameter. In simulation studies, we show that our modified Bonferroni adjustment controls familywise error and has greater power to detect proportional interactions compared with multiplcity-corrected subgroup analyses. We demonstrate our methodology by using the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction Treatment trial, a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of enalapril to reduce the risk of death or hospitalization in chronic heart failure patients.

However, data obtained to date in both animal and human studies of various designs show conflicting results regarding the benefit or lack of benefit of angiotensin inhibition strategies. It has also been shown that the type of ACE genotype may influence the effects of drugs on restenosis, suggesting that in the future, a pharmacogenetic approach might be of use for augmenting the benefit in patients from inhibitors of the angiotensin system.

    "936": "Cachexia is a serious complication of many chronic diseases, such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Many factors are involved in the development of cachexia, and there is increasing evidence that angiotensin II (Ang II), the main effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), plays an important role in this process. Patients with advanced CHF or CKD often have increased Ang II levels and cachexia, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment improves weight loss. In rodent models, an increase in systemic Ang II leads to weight loss through increased protein breakdown, reduced protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and decreased appetite. Ang II activates the ubiquitin-proteasome system via generation of reactive oxygen species and via inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, Ang II inhibits 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and disrupts normal energy balance. Ang II also increases cytokines and circulating hormones such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, serum amyloid-A, glucocorticoids and myostatin, which regulate muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Ang II acts on hypothalamic neurons to regulate orexigenic/anorexigenic neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide-Y, orexin and corticotropin-releasing hormone, leading to reduced appetite. Also, Ang II may regulate skeletal muscle regenerative processes. Several clinical studies have indicated that blockade of Ang II signaling via ACE inhibitors or Ang II type 1 receptor blockers prevents weight loss and improves muscle strength. Thus the RAS is a promising target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in patients with CHF and CKD. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Molecular basis of muscle wasting.",

Arterial hypotension in hemodialysis or dehydration in peritoneal dialysis are deleterious in terms of preservation of RRF. Loop diuretics increase urine volume and natriuresis, not RRF. Radiocontrast and aminoglycosides may be used safely. The benefits of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are debated but have positive effect on blood pressure control and cardiac function.

Membrane fractionation showed that peptides with sizes <3 kDa had significantly (p<0.05) reduced surface hydrophobicity when compared to the RPHs and peptide fractions with sizes >3 kDa. In contrast, the <3 kDa peptides showed significantly (p<0.05) higher oxygen radical scavenging ability when compared to the >3 kDa peptides and RPHs. In vitro inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) was significantly (p<0.05) higher for the Thermolysin, Proteinase K and Alcalase RPHs when compared to the pepsin+pancreatin (PP) and Flavourzyme RPHs. The Alcalase RPH had significantly (p<0.05) higher renin inhibition among the RPHs, while with the exception of Thermolysin, the 5-10 kDa peptide fraction had the least renin-inhibitory ability when compared to the <5 kDa peptide fractions. Oral administration (100mg/kg body weight) of the RPHs and RPI to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) showed the Alcalase RPH to be the most effective in blood pressure (BP) reduction (\u223c24 mm Hg) while Proteinase K RPH was the least effective (\u223c5 mm Hg) after 8h. However, the PP RPH had the most prolonged effect with BP reduction of \u223c20 mm Hg after 24h of oral administration. We conclude that the strong BP-lowering ability of Alcalase and PP RPHs could be due to high resistance of the peptides to structural degradation coupled with high absorption rate within the gastrointestinal tract.",

We describe a unique adjunct to standard safety assessment wherein the metabolite profile of treated animals is compared with the MetaMap Tox metabolomics database in order to predict the potential for a wide variety of adverse events, including DIKI. To examine this approach, a study of five compounds (phenytoin, cyclosporin A, doxorubicin, captopril, and lisinopril) was initiated by the Technology Evaluation Consortium under the auspices of the Drug Safety Executive Council (DSEC). The metabolite profiles for rats treated with these compounds matched established reference patterns in the MetaMap Tox metabolomics database indicative of each compound's well-described clinical toxicities. For example, the DIKI associated with cyclosporine A and doxorubicin was correctly predicted by metabolite profiling, while no evidence for DIKI was found for phenytoin, consistent with its clinical picture. In some cases the clinical toxicity (hepatotoxicity), not generally seen in animal studies, was detected with MetaMap Tox.

Urinary ACE2 was studied in the db/db model of type 2 diabetes and stretozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes during several physiological and pharmacological interventions. ACE2 activity in db/db mice was increased in the serum and to a much greater extent in the urine compared with db/m controls. Neither a specific ANG II blocker, telmisartan, nor an ACE inhibitor, captopril, altered the levels of urinary ACE2 in db/db or db/m control mice. High-salt diet (8%) increased whereas low-salt diet (0.1%) decreased urinary ACE2 activity in the urine of db/db mice. In STZ mice, urinary ACE2 was also increased, and insulin decreased it partly but significantly after several weeks of administration. The increase in urinary ACE2 activity in db/db mice reflected an increase in enzymatically active protein with two bands identified of molecular size at 110 and 75 kDa and was associated with an increase in kidney cortex ACE2 protein at 110 kDa but not at 75 kDa. ACE2 activity was increased in isolated tubular preparations but not in glomeruli from db/db mice. Administration of soluble recombinant ACE2 to db/m and db/db mice resulted in a marked increase in serum ACE2 activity, but no gain in ACE2 activity was detectable in the urine, further demonstrating that urinary ACE2 is of kidney origin. Increased urinary ACE2 was associated with more efficient degradation of exogenous ANG II (10(-9) M) in urine from db/db compared with that from db/m mice. Urinary ACE2 could be a potential biomarker of increased metabolism of ANG II in diabetic kidney disease.",

More patients (74/392, 18.9%) in group A had renal involvement as compared to patients in group B (17/134, 12.7%). Of the 91 patients with renal involvement, 26 were followed up and underwent kidney biopsy. Thirteen patients had only proteinuria and another 13 had renal dysfunction with or without proteinuria. Most common histological diagnosis was mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (mes PGN) (10/26). Two patients had collapsing FSGS (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) and three patients had immune complex glomerulonephritis. Seven patients had acute kidney injury, whom six totally recovered from their renal function. All patients with mesPGN tolerated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors well. There was mixed response of collapsing FSGS to steroids. Both patients with MPGN (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis) did well on low dose of steroid and ART.",

Longitudinal studies with robust study design and large sample size need to be done to confirm the findings.", 
    "954": "Animal studies suggest temporary renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade enhances long-term vascular protective effects; however, this is not established in humans. Here we evaluated the long-term effects of prior RAS blockade on hemodynamic function, urinary measures of inflammation, and tissue antioxidant mRNA expression in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who participated in the 5-year Renin Angiotensin System Study (RASS). At 4 years after completing the RASS and discontinuing study medication, renal hemodynamic responses to clamped hyperglycemia were significantly greater in 18 patients in the RAS blockade group compared to 9 patients of the placebo-treated group. Individuals who had received RAS blockade also exhibited higher flow-mediated vasodilatation, reduced urinary cytokine excretion in response to hyperglycemia, and increased skin mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase-1 and catalase. Thus, patients with uncomplicated T1DM who received prior RAS blockade for 5 years maintain long-term effects on renal hemodynamic and systemic vascular function, inflammatory pathways in the kidney, and antioxidant enzyme expression in skin 4 years after discontinuation of therapy. Our findings suggest that sustained long-term protective effects of finite RAS inhibition requires further study.",

    "959": "Hypercapnia (HC) increases systemic oxygen delivery (DO2) and gastric mucosal oxygenation. However, it activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which conversely reduces mesenteric perfusion. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of RAAS inhibition during normocapnia and HC on oral and gastric mucosal oxygenation (\u03bcHbO2) and to assess the effect of blood pressure under these circumstances. Five dogs were repeatedly anesthetized to study the effects of ACE inhibition (ACE-I; 5\u200amg/kg captopril, followed by 0.25\u200amg/kg per h) on \u03bcHbO2 (reflectance spectrophotometry) and hemodynamic variables during normocapnia (end-tidal CO2=35\u200ammHg) and HC (end-expiratory carbon dioxide (etCO2)=70\u200ammHg). In the control group, the dogs were subjected to HC alone. To exclude the effects of reduced blood pressure, in one group, blood pressure was maintained at baseline values via titrated phenylephrine (PHE) infusion during HC and additional captopril infusion. ACE-I strongly reduced gastric \u03bcHbO2 from 72\u00b12 to 65\u00b12% and mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 64\u00b12 to 48\u00b14\u200ammHg, while DO2 remained unchanged. This effect was counteracted in the presence of HC, which increased gastric \u03bcHbO2 from 73\u00b13 to 79\u00b16% and DO2 from 15\u00b12 to 22\u00b14\u200aml/kg per min during ACE-I without differences during HC alone. However, MAP decreased similar to that observed during ACE-I alone from 66\u00b13 to 47\u00b15\u200ammHg, while left ventricular contractility (dPmax) increased from 492\u00b163 to 758\u00b1119\u200ammHg/s. Titrated infusion of PHE had no additional effects on \u03bcHbO2. In summary, our data suggest that RAAS inhibition reduces gastric mucosal oxygenation in healthy dogs. HC not only abolishes this effect, but also increases \u03bcHbO2, DO2, and dPmax. The increase in \u03bcHbO2 during ACE-I under HC is in accordance with our results independent of blood pressure.",

RAAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), decrease the rate of progression of diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathies and are first-line therapies for CKD. Although these agents are highly effective, current therapeutic strategies are unable to sufficiently suppress the RAAS and stop CKD progression. Aliskiren, the first in a new class of RAAS-inhibiting agents (direct renin inhibitors) has been approved to treat hypertension. Aliskiren exerts renoprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-atherosclerotic effects in animal models that appear to be independent of its blood pressure lowering activity. Early clinical studies using urinary protein excretion as a marker of renal involvement suggest a possibly novel role for aliskiren in treating CKD. This review discusses the antiproteinuric efficacy and safety of aliskiren and considers the evidence for its potential renoprotection.", 
    "965": "The aim of the present study was to analyze differences in cough induction between losartan and lisinopril in both anaesthetized and awake rabbits, i.e., under conditions in which the influences of higher brain areas on the cough reflex are strongly reduced or abolished. Losartan (500 \u03bcg/kg), lisinopril (100 \u03bcg/kg) and NaCl 0.9% saline solution (vehicle) were administered by intravenous injections. Animals were randomly assigned to the different experimental treatments. The cough reflex was induced by chemical (citric acid) and/or mechanical stimulation of the tracheobronchial tree. In anaesthetized rabbits, losartan and lisinopril caused similar hypotensive effects. Lisinopril, but not losartan, increased the cough response induced by both mechanical and chemical stimulation due to increases in the cough number, i.e. the number of coughs induced by each stimulation challenge. In awake animals, only lisinopril significantly increased the cough number. The results support the notion that cough potentiation induced by losartan, and possibly other sartans, is lower than that induced by most angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors despite the reduction or complete absence of higher brain functions. In this connection, the comparison between present results and our previous findings on ramipril and zofenopril shows that losartan and zofenopril display similar cough-inducing potency, much lower than that of lisinopril and ramipril.",

Proteolytic activities were the highest on day 7 of refrigerated storage in A. sativum-FC-yogurt (337.0 +/- 5.3 microg g(-1)) followed by FC-yogurt (275.3 +/- 2.0 microg g(-1)), A. sativum-yogurt (245.8 +/- 4.2 microg g(-1)) and plain-yogurt (40.4 +/- 1.2 microg g(-1)). On the other hand, proteolytic activities in cheese ripening were the highest (p < 0.05) on day 14 of storage for plain and A. sativum-cheeses (411.4 +/- 4.3 and 528.7 +/- 1.6 microg g(-1), respectively). However, the presence of FC increased the proteolysis to the highest level on day 28 of storage for FC- and A. sativum-FC cheeses (641.2 +/- 0.1 and 1128.4 +/- 4.5 microg g(-1), respectively). In addition, plain- and A. sativum-yogurts with or without FC showed maximal inhibition of ACE on day 7 of storage. Fresh plain- and A. sativum-cheeses showed ACE inhibition (72.3 +/- 7.8 and 50.4 +/- 1.6 % respectively), the presence of FC in both type of cheeses reduced the ACE inhibition to 62.9 +/- 0.8 and 44.5 +/- 5.0%, respectively. However, refrigerated storage increased ACE inhibition in cheeses (p < 0.05 on day 28) in the presence of FC more than in the absence. In conclusion, the presence of FC in A. sativum-yogurt or cheese enhanced the proteolytic activity. Thus, it has potential in the development of an effective dietary strategy for hypertension associated cardiovascular diseases.",

The pancreas islet and less \u03b2-cells damage were observed after the administration of trig to diabetic rats. The increase of GLP-1 in surviving diabetic rats suppressed the increase of blood glucose level and improved results in the oral glucose and starch tolerance test. Trig also normalized key enzyme related to hypertension as ACE and improved the hemoglobin A1c and lipid profiles (plasma triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and total cholesterol), and liver indices toxicity. Therefore, these results revealed that Trig was successful in improving glycemic control, metabolic parameters, and liver function in diabetic rats.

Intense pathologic stresses cause a dramatic increase in the number of renin-producing cells in the kidney, termed JG cell recruitment, but how this occurs is not fully understood. Here, we isolated renal CD44(+) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells and found that they differentiated into JG-like renin-expressing cells both in vitro and in vivo. Sodium depletion and captopril led to activation and differentiation of these cells into renin-expressing cells in the adult kidney. In summary, CD44(+) MSC-like cells exist in the adult kidney and can differentiate into JG-like renin-producing cells under conditions that promote JG cell recruitment.",

Polymorph (Io) crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, while tetragonal form (It) crystallizes in the space group P4(1)2(1)2 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The geometric parameters of (Io) are very similar to those of (It). The six-membered rings in both polymorphs adopt a slightly deformed chair conformation and the piperazinedione rings are in a boat conformation. However, the proline rings adopt an envelope conformation in (Io), while in (It) the ring exists in a slightly deformed half-chair conformation. The most significant difference between the two structures is the orientation of the ethyl pentanoate chain. Molecules associate in pairs in a head-to-tail manner forming infinite columns. In (Io), molecules are related by a twofold screw axis forming identical columns, while in (It), molecules in successive neighbouring columns are related by alternating twofold screw axes and fourfold screw axes.

By using this pipeline, we were able to derive thousands of peptides with potential ACE-inhibitory capacity, from which 15 structurally diverse, theoretically active samples were investigated systematically with respect to the structural, energetic, and dynamic aspects of their interactions with ACE. Subsequently, ACE-inhibitory activities of several highly promising candidates were evaluated in\u2005vitro using a standard spectrophotometric method. As might be expected, three of these candidates showed high inhibitory activities against ACE and others also significantly inhibited the enzymatic activity at low or moderate doses.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the key peptidase of the RAS, is promiscuous in that it cleaves other substrates such as substance P and bradykinin. Accumulating evidence implicates ACE in the pathophysiology of carcinogenesis. While the role of ACE and its peptide network in modulating angiogenesis via the AT1R is well documented, its involvement in shaping other aspects of the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Here, we review the role of ACE in modulating the immune compartment of the tumor microenvironment, which encompasses the immunosuppressive, cancer-promoting myeloid-derived suppressor cells, alternatively activated tumor-associated macrophages, and T regulatory cells. We also discuss the potential roles of peptides that accumulate in the setting of chronic ACE inhibitor use, such as bradykinin, substance P, and N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP), and how they may undercut the gains of anti-angiogenesis from ACE inhibition.

DN develops on a background of hyperglycemia and an entangled metabolic imbalance, mainly oxidative stress. The majority of related pathways like polyol, advanced glycation end products, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, hexosamine, and protein kinase c all originated from initial oxidative stress. To date, no absolute cure for DN has been defined; although some drugs are conventionally used, much more can be found if all pathophysiological links with oxidative stress would be taken into account. In this paper, although current therapies for DN have been reviewed, we have mainly focused on the links between DN and oxidative stress and therapies on the horizon, such as inhibitors of protein kinase C, aldose reductase, and advanced glycation. With reference to oxidative stress and the related pathways, the following new drugs are under study such as taurine, acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, protein kinase C inhibitor (ruboxistaurin), aldose reductase inhibitors (fidarestat, epalrestat, ranirestat), advanced glycation end product inhibitors (benfotiamine, aspirin, aminoguanidine), the hexosamine pathway inhibitor (benfotiamine), inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (nicotinamide), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril).

It is important to determine the molecular mechanisms and treatment of this disease. The development of diabetes results in the formation of AGEs, oxidative stress, and the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) within the kidney, which promotes progressive inflammation and fibrosis, leading to DN and declining renal function. A number of novel therapies have also been tested in the experimental diabetic model, including exercise, inhibitors of the RAAS (angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors), inhibitors of AGE (pyridoxamine), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3 agonists (pioglitazone), inhibitors of lipid accumulation (statins and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)), and the vitamin D analogues.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic inhibition of the RAS on glucose and insulin levels during acute restraint stress. Male Holtzman rats were treated with 10 mg/kg per day enalapril solution or vehicle for 14 days. After 14 days, rats were divided into three experimental groups: enalapril + restraint (ER), vehicle + restraint (VR) and enalapril + saline (ES). Rats in the restraint groups were subjected to 30 min restraint stress, whereas rats in the ES groups were given saline infusion instead. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 5, 10, 20 and 30 min restraint stress or saline infusion. After restraint, a hyperglycaemic response was observed in the ER and VR groups that peaked at 20 and 10 min, respectively (P < 0.05 compared with baseline). The area under the glucose curve was markedly increased in the ER and VR groups compared with that in the ES group (P < 0.05 for both). Importantly, restraint induced a marked increase in insulin secretion in the ER group compared with only a mild elevation in the VR group; insulin secretion in both groups peaked at 20 min (P < 0.05 compared with baseline). Analysis of the area under the insulin curve confirmed an increase in insulin secretion in the ER compared with the VR and ES groups (P < 0.05 for both). The results of the present study reinforce that the RAS is involved in modulating responses to stress and suggest that RAS inhibition with enalapril may increase glucose-induced insulin secretion in response to acute restraint.", 
    "1070": "Stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1 is a chemokine that recruits bone marrow-derived endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) development. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors mediate the compensatory effects of ACE and CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), which results in the degradation and inactivation of SDF-1 in vivo. ACE inhibitors, such as imidapril, exhibit potential antiangiogenic effects on laser-induced CNV in mice. The role that this imidapril-mediated effect plays in modulating SDF-1 signals has not been defined. The present study assessed the effect of the CD26/SDF-1 signaling pathway on the inhibitory effect of imidapril in CNV development.", 
    "1071": "CNV was induced in C57BL/6J mice by focally rupturing Bruch's membrane using a 532-nm diode laser. The animals were pretreated with PBS, imidapril, diprotin-A (a DPP IV antagonist), or imidapril plus diprotin-A for 5 days before photocoagulation. Treatments were continued daily for 14 days following the laser induction. The normal control group did not undergo laser rupture or receive treatment. CD26 activity was measured using a substrate conversion assay and flow cytometry. SDF-1 levels in both the blood and the bone marrow were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and leukocytes was quantified. Functional analyses of circulating SDF-1 were performed using actin polymerization blood biomarker assays, and the CNV-related responses were evaluated using fluorescein angiography and isolectin-B4-labeled flatmounts.", 
    "1072": "Imidapril directly amplified CD26 activity and had a minor effect on the number of CD26+ cells in the bone marrow. However, decreased CD26 activity in the plasma was secondary to a decrease in the number of circulating CD26+ cells and blood leukocytes. Furthermore, imidapril increased SDF-1 concentrations in the peripheral circulation via CD26-induced degradation of SDF-1 in the bone marrow, an effect that coincided with elevated numbers of circulating EPCs. CD26-mediated SDF-1 inactivation was demonstrated by a decrease in SDF-1-induced actin polymerization in the whole blood of imidapril-treated mice. Imidapril markedly decreased angiographic leakage and CNV size. CD26 inhibition completely blocked the CD26/SDF-1 signaling pathway in vivo and reduced the antiangiogenic effect of imidapril.",

This study investigates the possible beneficial effects of the ACE inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril and the AT1 receptor blocker (ARB), valsartan, on renal ACE expression, renal structure, and function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Male Wistar rats were allocated into four groups: control, STZ-diabetic rats, and STZ-diabetic rats treated with either enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) or valsartan (50 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Enalapril and valsartan reduced renal ACE mRNA and protein expression, Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity, oxidative stress, and serum transforming growth factor-\u03b21 levels compared to the diabetic group. Both treatments normalized renal nitrate/nitrite levels and ameliorated the observed histopathological changes. In conclusion, ACE downregulation by ACEI and ARB indicates that angiotensin II upregulates ACE through AT1 receptor. Prevention of diabetes-induced changes in ACE expression and Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity could be a new explanation of the renoprotective effects of ACEIs and ARBs.",

Restoring physiological VWF handling might contribute to ACE inhibitors' (ACEi) reno- and cardioprotective effects. To assess how Pro618Ala ADAMTS13 variants and related proteolytic activity interact with ACEi therapy in predicting renal and cardiovascular complications, we genotyped 1,163 normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients from BErgamo NEphrologic DIabetes Complications Trial (BENEDICT). Interaction between Pro618Ala and ACEi was significant in predicting both renal and combined renal and cardiovascular events. The risk for renal or combined events versus reference Ala carriers on ACEi progressively increased from Pro/Pro homozygotes on ACEi (hazard ratio 2.80 [95% CI 0.849-9.216] and 1.58 [0.737-3.379], respectively) to Pro/Pro homozygotes on non-ACEi (4.77 [1.484-15.357] and 1.99 [0.944-4.187]) to Ala carriers on non-ACEi (8.50 [2.416-29.962] and 4.00 [1.739-9.207]). In a substudy, serum ADAMTS13 activity was significantly lower in Ala carriers than in Pro/Pro homozygotes and in case subjects with renal, cardiovascular, or combined events than in diabetic control subjects without events. ADAMTS13 activity significantly and negatively correlated with all outcomes. In patients with diabetes, ADAMTS13 618Ala variant associated with less proteolytic activity, higher risk of chronic complications, and better response to ACEi therapy. Screening for Pro618Ala polymorphism may help identify patients with diabetes at highest risk who may benefit the most from early reno- and cardioprotective therapy.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of lignin for chemical-activation-free synthesis of functional mesoporous carbon. The synthesized carbons possess the pore widths within the range of 2.5-12.0 nm. In this series of mesoporous carbons, our best result demonstrates a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 418 m(2)/g and a mesopore volume of 0.34 cm(3)/g, which is twice the micropore volume in this carbon. Because of the dominant mesoporosity, this engineered carbon demonstrates adsorption and controlled release of a representative pharmaceutical drug, captopril, in simulated gastric fluid. Large-scale utilization of these sustainable mesoporous carbons in applications involving adsorption, transport, and controlled release of functional molecules is desired for industrial processes that yield lignin as a coproduct.",

ACE inhibitors are associated with adverse side effects such as persistent dry cough (ACE-cough) and, rarely, life-threatening angioedema (ACE-AE). The authors investigated the influence of ACE I/D polymorphism in combination with serum ACE activity, B\u2082 receptor -9/+9 polymorphism, and B\u2082 receptor C-58T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the development of ACE-AE and ACE-cough. The frequencies of ACE I/D as well as B\u2082 receptor +9/-9 and C-58T polymorphisms were compared in patients with ACE-AE, ACE-cough, and ACE inhibitor-exposed controls, and serum ACE activity was measured. There were 52 cases of ACE-AE, 36 cases of ACE-cough, and 77 controls. The genotyping revealed a significant association between the B\u2082 -9 allele and ACE inhibitor-induced AE (62% vs 38%, P=.008), and ACE inhibitor-induced cough (61% vs 38%, P=.02) when compared with controls. There was no significant association between ACE I/D polymorphism as well as the B\u2082 C-58T SNP with both ACE-induced AE and cough. ACE activity was significantly higher in controls compared with patients with ACE-AE (34.5 \u00b1 1.14 mU/mL vs 17.8 \u00b1 0.86 mU/mL, P=.0001) and ACE-cough (34.5 \u00b1 1.14 mU/mL vs 23.3 \u00b1 1.88 mU/mL, P=.0001).

Bradykinin is metabolized by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE inhibition enhances bradykinin relaxations. Our goal was to characterize the role of bradykinin receptors and endothelial factors in ACE inhibitor-enhanced relaxations in bovine coronary arteries. In U46619 preconstricted arteries, bradykinin (10-11-10-8m) caused concentration-dependent relaxations (maximal relaxation \u2265100%, log EC50=-9.8\u00b10.1). In the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 30 \u03bcm) and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 \u03bcm), relaxations were reduced by an inhibitor of EET synthesis, miconazole (10 \u03bcm) (maximal relaxation=55\u00b110%). Bradykinin relaxations were inhibited by the bradykinin 2 (B2) receptor antagonist, D-Arg0-Hyp3-Thi5,8-D-Phe7-bradykinin (1 \u03bcm) (log EC50=-8.5\u00b10.1) but not altered by the B1 receptor antagonist, des-Arg9[Leu8]bradykinin (1 \u03bcm). Mass spectrometric analysis of bovine coronary artery bradykinin metabolites revealed a time-dependent increase in bradykinin (1-5) and (1-7) suggesting metabolism by ACE. ACE inhibition with captopril (50 \u03bcm) enhanced bradykinin relaxations (log EC50=-10.3\u00b10.1). The enhanced relaxations were eliminated by L-NA or the B1 receptor antagonist but not the B2 receptor antagonist. Our results demonstrate that ACE inhibitor-enhanced bradykinin relaxations of bovine coronary arteries occur through endothelial cell B1 receptor activation and NO.", 
    "1084": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and slowly progressive ventricular dysfunction. Treatment for families with ARVD/C is directed toward prevention of sudden cardiac death, prevention or delay of disease progression, and adjustment to life with a lifelong chronic genetic disease. As there have been no randomized trials of ARVD/C treatments or screening regimens, treatment decisions are based on clinical expertise, results of retrospective registry-based studies, and understanding of pathologic mechanisms of disease. The first step for treatment is securing an accurate diagnosis through careful application of the diagnostic Task Force criteria. Following diagnosis in an index case, family members are screened. We advise affected individuals and gene carriers to dramatically reduce exercise and strongly recommend that ARVD/C patients discontinue competitive athletics. We generally recommend implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement in all probands who meet Task Force criteria, especially if they have a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), arrhythmogenic syncope, or frequent ventricular ectopy and/or nonsustained VT. We are more circumspect about recommending implantation of an ICD in a family member who has been diagnosed with ARVD/C through family screening, as these individuals are now being identified at a much earlier stage in their disease than was possible previously. Anti-arrhythmic medications and catheter ablation are used to decrease the frequency of ventricular tachycardia and associated implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapies. Epicardial ablation is offered if endocardial ablation fails or as part of an initial combined endocaridal/epicardial ablation strategy, depending on patient preference. We attempt to initiate beta-blocker therapy and therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to limit structural progression and prevent ventricular arrhythmias. Unaffected family members are screened for disease onset regularly from adolescence through noninvasive cardiac testing.

    "1090": "By the time it was appreciated that the positive inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides is due to inhibition of the membrane Na(+)-K(+) pump, glycosides had been used for treatment of heart failure on an empiric basis for ~200 years. The subsequent documentation of their lack of clinical efficacy and possible harmful effect largely coincided with the discovery that a raised Na(+) concentration in cardiac myocytes plays an important role in the electromechanical phenotype of heart failure syndromes. Consistent with this, efficacious pharmacological treatments for heart failure have been found to stimulate the Na(+)-K(+) pump, effectively the only export route for intracellular Na(+) in the heart failure. A paradigm has emerged that implicates pump inhibition in the raised Na(+) levels in heart failure. It invokes protein kinase-dependent activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase) and glutathionylation, a reversible oxidative modification, of the Na(+)-K(+) pump molecular complex that inhibits its activity. Since treatments of proven efficacy reverse the oxidative Na(+)-K(+) pump inhibition, the pump retains its status as a key pharmacological target in heart failure. Its role as a target is well integrated with the paradigms of neurohormonal abnormalities, raised myocardial oxidative stress and energy deficiency implicated in the pathophysiology of the failing heart. We propose that targeting oxidative inhibition of the pump is useful for the exploration of future treatment strategies.

    "1098": "Heart failure (HF) is frequent in the elderly population and is associated with high mortality, prolonged and frequent hospitalisations. In old patients with multiple comorbid diseases, clinical symptoms of HF are less typical and the prognosis is poorer. Comprehensive geriatric assessment, using simple tests to evaluate cognitive function, falls, depression, malnutrition, dependency, comorbidities, context of life and social conditions, is needed in order to screen concomitant diseases and loss of autonomy. Because of lack of specific studies on octogenarians, most recommendations for HF treatment in this population have been extrapolated from data based on younger populations. Epidemiological studies show that recommended HF therapies as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers are underused in elderly patients with HF. Reasons for this under prescription are various and include the absence of well-defined therapeutic strategy especially in case of preserved ejection fraction, the existence of comorbidities and the fear of adverse events. Special precautions for the use of HF drugs must be followed because of the comorbidities and age-related changes in drug pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Increase of drug dose must be closely monitored for adverse reactions. Overall, the therapeutic strategy must not be based on the subject's age, but rather on the individual analysis taking into account the severity of the heart disease, the geriatric assessment, the life expectancy and the quality of life. Clinical and laboratory monitoring should be intensified, especially in case of acute episode (infection, dehydration, introduction of a new treatment, fall\u2026).

It appears that, although some patients have a preponderantly sympathetic or vagal overactivation leading to AF, a combined sympathovagal drive is most commonly responsible for AF triggering. The purpose of this hypothesis-generating study was to test whether moxonidine, a centrally acting sympathoinhibitory agent, on top of optimal antihypertensive treatment, can lead to a decrease in AF burden in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF. This was a prospective, double-blind, 1-group, crossover study. Hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF sequentially received treatment with placebo and moxonidine for two 6-week periods, respectively. The change in AF burden (measured as minutes of AF per day in three 48-hour Holter recordings) between the 2 treatment periods was the primary outcome measure. Fifty-six patients (median age 63.5 years, 35 men) were included. During moxonidine treatment, AF burden was reduced from 28.0 min/day (interquartile range [IQR] 15.0 to 57.8) to 16.5 min/day (IQR 4.0 to 36.3; p <0.01). European Heart Rhythm Association symptom severity class decreased from a median of 2.0 (IQR 1.0 to 2.0) to 1.0 (IQR 1.0 to 2.0; p = 0.01). Systolic blood pressure levels were similar in the 2 treatment periods, whereas diastolic blood pressure was lower (p <0.01) during moxonidine treatment.

    "1107": "In mammalian species, except humans, N-terminal processing of the precursor peptide angiotensin I (ANG-1-10) into ANG-2-10 or ANG-3-10 was reported. Here we hypothesize that aminopeptidase-generated angiotensins bearing the same C-terminus as ANG-1-10 are also present in humans. We demonstrate the time dependent generation of ANG-2-10, ANG-3-10, ANG-4-10, ANG-5-10 and ANG-6-10 from the precursor ANG-1-10 by human plasma proteins. The endogenous presence of ANG-4-10, ANG-5-10 and ANG-6-10 in human plasma was confirmed by an immuno-fluorescence assay. Generation of ANG-2-10, ANG-3-10 and ANG-4-10 from ANG-1-10 by immobilized human plasma proteins was sensitive to the cysteine/serine protease inhibitor antipain. The metal ion chelator EDTA inhibited Ang-6-10-generation. Incubation of the substrates ANG-3-10, ANG-4-10 and ANG-5-10 with recombinant aminopeptidase N (APN) resulted in a successive N-terminal processing, finally releasing ANG-6-10 as a stable end product, demonstrating a high similarity concerning the processing pattern of the angiotensin peptides compared to the angiotensin generating activity in plasma. Recombinant ACE-1 hydrolyzed the peptides ANG-2-10, ANG-3-10, ANG-4-10 and ANG-5-10 into ANG-2-8, ANG-3-8, ANG-4-8 and ANG-5-8. Since ANG-2-10 was processed into ANG-2-8, ANG-4-8 and ANG-5-8 by plasma proteases the angiotensin peptides bearing the same C-terminus as ANG-1-10 likely have a precursor function in human plasma. Our results confirm the hypothesis of aminopeptidase mediated processing of ANG-1-10 in humans. We show the existence of an aminopeptidase mediated pathway in humans that bypasses the known ANG-1-8-carboxypeptidase pathway. This expands the knowledge about the known human renin angiotensin system, showing how efficiently the precursor ANG-1-10 is used by nature.",

    "1140": "Inotropic treatment remains the cornerstone for cardiogenic shock, an emergency that requires immediate resuscitative therapy before shock irreversibly damages vital organs. Although the sympathomimetic drug dobutamine is the most widely-used inotropic drug worldwide, it has several side effects including sinus tachycardia. Dobutamine partly restores systolic heart failure (HF); however, it increases the heart rate (HR) which counterbalances the beneficial effects. Ivabradine, a new selective If inhibitor, provides specific HR reduction and is indicated in stable coronary artery disease and in stable chronic HF with left ventricular dysfunction. Despite scarce data indicating beneficial effects of ivabradine in sinus tachycardia in various clinical settings, this drug remains contraindicated in acute HF. We propose that ivabradine could help to prevent the dobutamine-induced side effects, and that their combination in clinical practice could lead to pure inotropic effects, useful for the management of cardiogenic shock.", 
    "1141": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the coronary effects of Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)] in hypertrophic rat hearts. Heart hypertrophy was induced by abdominal aorta CoA (coarctation). Ang-(1-7) and AVE 0991, a non-peptide Mas-receptor agonist, at picomolar concentration, induced a significant vasodilation in hearts from sham-operated rats. These effects were blocked by the Mas receptor antagonist A-779. Pre-treatment with L-NAME (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) or ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinozalin-1-one) [NOS (NO synthase) and soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitors respectively] also abolished the effect of Ang-(1-7) in control hearts. The coronary vasodilation produced by Ang-(1-7) and AVE 0991 was completely blunted in hypertrophic hearts. Chronic oral administration of losartan in CoA rats restored the coronary vasodilation effect of Ang-(1-7). This effect was blocked by A-779 and AT2 receptor (angiotensin II type 2 receptor) antagonist PD123319. Acute pre-incubation with losartan also restored the Ang-(1-7)-induced, but not BK (bradykinin)-induced, coronary vasodilation in hypertrophic hearts. This effect was inhibited by A-779, PD123319 and L-NAME. Chronic treatment with losartan did not change the protein expression of Mas and AT2 receptor and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) and ACE2 in coronary arteries from CoA rats, but induced a slight increase in AT2 receptor in aorta of these animals. Ang-(1-7)-induced relaxation in aortas from sham-operated rats was absent in aortas from CoA rats. In vitro pre-treatment with losartan restored the Ang-(1-7)-induced relaxation in aortic rings of CoA rats, which was blocked by the Mas antagonist A-779 and L-NAME. These data demonstrate that Mas is strongly involved in coronary vasodilation and that AT1 receptor (angiotensin II type 1 receptor) blockade potentiates the vasodilatory effects of Ang-(1-7) in the coronary beds of pressure-overloaded rat hearts through NO-related AT2- and Mas-receptor-dependent mechanisms. These data suggest the association of Ang-(1-7) and AT1 receptor antagonists as a potential therapeutic avenue for coronary artery diseases.", 
    "1142": "The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), commonly associated with many diseases, is believed to have affected human adaptation to environmental changes during the out-of-Africa expansion. APOBEC3B (A3B), a member of the cytidine deaminase family APOBEC3s, also exhibits a variable gene insertion/deletion polymorphism across world populations. Using data available from published reports, we examined the global geographic distribution of ACE and A3B genotypes. In tracking the modern human dispersal routes of these two genes, we found that the variation trends of the two I/D polymorphisms were directly correlated. We observed that the frequencies of ACE insertion and A3B deletion rose in parallel along the expansion route. To investigate the presence of a correlation between the two polymorphisms and the effect of their interaction on human health, we analyzed 1199 unrelated Chinese adults to determine their genotypes and other important clinical characteristics. We discovered a significant difference between the ACE genotype/allele distribution in the A3B DD and A3B II/ID groups (P\u200a=\u200a0.045 and 0.015, respectively), indicating that the ACE Alu I allele frequency in the former group was higher than in the latter group. No specific clinical phenotype could be associated with the interaction between the ACE and A3B I/D polymorphisms. A3B has been identified as a powerful inhibitor of Alu retrotransposition, and primate A3 genes have undergone strong positive selection (and expansion) for restricting the mobility of endogenous retrotransposons during evolution. Based on these findings, we suggest that the ACE Alu insertion was enabled (facilitated) by the A3B deletion and that functional loss of A3B provided an opportunity for enhanced human adaptability and survival in response to the environmental and climate challenges arising during the migration from Africa.", 
    "1143": "Reduction of weight in obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) individuals is emerging as a significant strategy in the reduction of proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy along with control of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The objective was to evaluate the reduction in 24-h proteinuria in T2DM patients with nephropathy by weight loss, with conventional therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) as the control arm. A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted between June 2010 and May 2011. T2DM patients with confirmed nephropathy by 24-h urinary protein estimation with a body mass index (BMI) of >25 kg/m(2) were studied. Patients who had nondiabetic nephropathy, uncontrolled hypertension (>125/75 mmHg) irrespective of antihypertensive drugs, excess weight due to edema or obesity due to other specific diseases, alcoholics, smokers, and patients who were on hemodialysis were excluded from the study. The patients were divided into three groups, namely, group A, patients on ACE inhibitor therapy; group B, patients on lifestyle modifications for weight loss; and group C, patients on an antiobesity drug (orlistat) and lifestyle modifications. At the end of 6 months, all the three groups were compared. Data were analyzed using software SPSS version 15.0. This study encompassed a total of 88 patients; 12 patients were dropped during the study period and 76 (group A: 22, group B: 23, and group C: 31) patients remained. The mean age of the patients was 58.36 \u00b1 10.87 years (range: 30-70 years). At baseline, age, gender, mean BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and 24-h proteinuria did not vary significantly among the three groups. At 6 months, the mean BMI significantly decreased in group C (P < 0.001) compared to that in the other two groups. Among the parameters BMI and WHR, the proportional form of BMI correlated well with the degree of reduction in proteinuria (r = 0.397, P = 0.01). Reduction in weight using lifestyle modifications and antiobesity drugs might improve renal function and proteinuria safely as observed in obese patients with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "1144": "Diabetic patients are often treated with an ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or angiotensin receptor antagonist against hypertension or albuminuria. These drugs also have a positive impact on glucose tolerance, but the mechanism for this remains elusive. Hypothesizing a positive non-additive effect, we studied whether the angiotensin receptor antagonist telmisartan or the ACEi ramipril acutely influence insulin secretion and glycaemia in vivo in healthy and Type 2 diabetic rats through effects on islet blood perfusion. Telmisartan and ramipril were injected intravenously into anaesthetized non-diabetic Wistar rats or Type 2 diabetic GK (Goto-Kakizaki) rats. In non-diabetic Wistar rats, neither whole PBF (pancreatic blood flow) nor IBF (islet blood flow) were significantly influenced by telmisartan and ramipril, alone or in combination. Renal blood flow was enhanced significantly by telmisartan and ramipril when used in combination, whereas ABF (adrenal blood flow) was not affected by any of the drugs. Telmisartan and ramipril both significantly increased serum insulin levels, but did not influence glycaemia. In Type 2 diabetic GK rats, both whole PBF and IBF were significantly decreased by telmisartan and ramipril, but only when used in combination. Renal blood flow was enhanced significantly by telmisartan and ramipril alone, but not when used in combination, whereas ABF was not affected by any of the drugs. Telmisartan and ramipril both significantly decreased serum insulin levels, and non-additively elevated blood glucose levels. In conclusion, the present study suggests that a local pancreatic RAS (renin-angiotensin system), sensitive to acute administration of telmisartan and ramipril, controls pancreatic IBF and insulin secretion and thereby has an impact on glucose tolerance. Our findings indicate unexpected significant differences in the effects of these agents on islet microcirculation, in vivo insulin secretion and glycaemia between healthy and Type 2 diabetic rats.",

The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial study randomized patients with congestive heart failure to the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan versus placebo, in addition to baseline angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy. Overall, valsartan was found to significantly reduce the combined morbidity and mortality end point compared with placebo, mainly due to a reduction in heart failure admissions. However, a subgroup analysis showed that patients receiving triple therapy with valsartan, an ACE-I and a \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker, appeared to do worse. These findings led to speculation that \"triple therapy\" with ARB, ACE-I, and nonselective \u03b2-blocker might be harmful, possibly due to excessive neurohormonal inhibition. In contrast, in the Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity-added study, the \"triple therapy\" combination of ARB, ACE-I, and \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker was proven safe and beneficial. We propose that the discrepancy in outcomes observed in these two trials is related to the interaction between the \u03b11-adrenoceptor and the angiotensin II type-1 receptor, and it is not just an inherent adverse event related to \"triple therapy.\"",

They were then divided into the following groups: sham operation; LV hypertrophy; LV hypertrophy+benazepril (1mg/kg in a gavage, once a day for 4 weeks). Both morphological assays (hemodynamic and hemorheological measurement; LV hypertrophy assessment), and molecular assays (protein levels of Collagen type I/III, TNF-\u03b1 and VCAM-1; TGF-\u03b2 gene expression; NF-\u03baB or Smad activation; intracellular ROS production) were performed.", 
    "1161": "The following effects were observed in rats treated with benazepril: (1) marked improvements in hemodynamic and hemorheological parameters; (2) significant reductions in LV hypertrophy, dilatation and fibrosis; (3) significantly attenuated protein levels of Collagen type I/III, TGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and VCAM-1, NF-\u03baB or Smad activation, as well as intracellular ROS production.", 
    "1162": "These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of benazepril may be ascribed to their down-regulation of both NF-\u03baB and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways by acting on the intracellular ROS production in rats with LV hypertrophy, thus supporting the use of benazepril as an anti-inflammatory agent."
