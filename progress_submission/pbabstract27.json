    "0": "Neurohormonal activation is an important driver of heart failure progression, and all pharmacologic interventions that improve clinical outcomes inhibit this systemic response to myocardial injury. Functional polymorphisms affecting mediator levels and signal transduction are present in genetic loci critical to renin-angiotensin and sympathetic activation. Clinical investigations have demonstrated that these neurohormonal polymorphisms influence heart failure outcomes and alter the effectiveness of drug therapy. Genetic variation of disease modifiers such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and beta-adrenergic receptors influences ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker effectiveness. The investigation of functional genomics will allow pharmacologic therapeutics to be tailored to an individual's specific genetic background. This article explores how genetic variation in genes involved in neurohormonal activation influence heart failure outcomes and the impact of pharmacotherapy.", 
    "1": "The utilization of angiotensin-II attenuating agents is the standard of care in the management of patients with left ventricular dysfunction regardless of the etiology. The most effective agents of this group includes both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARB). Given the worse outcomes noted in those patients who have coronary artery disease, efforts to optimize appropriate pharmacotherapy in this population is imperative. There does appear to be some advantage in the combination of ACE+ARB in chronic left ventricular dysfunction patients. In those patients that have sustained a recent myocardial infarction with concomitant left ventricular dysfunction, the combination of ACE+ARB does not improve survival and in fact might exacerbate renal dysfunction as well as hypotension. The appropriate employment of agents that attenuate the effects of angiotensin-II should be a priority in the care and management of the left ventricular dysfunction patient.", 
    "2": "Although considerable progress has been made in the pharmacologic and device management of chronic heart failure in recent decades, heart failure patients continue to remain symptomatic, with high hospitalization and mortality rates. A number of novel agents, including endothelin antagonists and tumor-necrosis factor blockers, have recently failed to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with heart failure. Have we reached a ceiling in preventing the progression of the disease? This article reviews successes and late-stage clinical trial disappointments in the treatment of patients with heart failure. Furthermore, the article discusses how agents that have beneficial effects in heart failure also generally attenuate or reverse ventricular remodeling, whereas the newer agents that have failed to improve clinical outcomes either had no effect on remodeling or have been associated with adverse remodeling.", 
    "3": "The current treatment paradigm for heart failure revolves around the central theory of neurohormonal antagonism. With the success of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition, beta-blockade, and aldosterone antagonism in heart failure, alternative areas of the hormonal cascade have been targeted for potential benefits. Two such agents, neutral endopeptidase inhibitors and endothelin antagonists, have demonstrated promising initial results in animal models and small, human-based studies but have fallen short when examined in larger clinical trials. The reasons for these shortcomings are varied and require analysis of the design of the studies as well as the intrinsic functions of these agents.", 
    "4": "Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the developed world. It is estimated that 5 million Americans suffer from heart failure (HF), and roughly 550,000 new cases are diagnosed annually. Studies have found that 40% to 71% of patients who have HF have relatively preserved systolic functions, or diastolic heart failure (DHF). Although there are abundant data to guide the treatment of heart failure and systolic dysfunction (systolic HF), evidence-based data are lacking in the management of DHF. This article examines the role of neurohormonal modulators in the management of DHF.", 
    "5": "Based on overwhelming data demonstrating reduced morbidity and mortality, ACE inhibitors form a mainstay of therapy in all patients with symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in the prevention of heart failure in patients with high-risk cardiovascular profiles. However, definite benefit from the use of ACE inhibitors in all patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction has not been demonstrated. Even though ACE inhibitors probably have a class effect in patients who have heart failure, it is recommended that ACE inhibitors that have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in clinical trials (captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril) be used because studies have clearly defined a dose for these agents that is effective in modifying the natural history of the disease. Attempts should be made to up titrate patients to target doses of ACE inhibitors that have been used in clinical trials, if tolerated.", 
    "6": "Although sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been extensively studied in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and low ejection fraction, prediction of SCD among individuals with preserved left ventricular systolic function is less well understood. We randomized 8,290 patients with stable CAD with preserved left ventricular systolic function to trandolapril or placebo in a secondary coronary prevention trial, and we used Cox proportional hazards models to identify independent baseline predictors of SCD during 4.8 year follow-up (median). Using a risk scoring algorithm based on simple clinical characteristics, we were able to distinguish individuals at higher risk for SCD. Independent determinants of SCD included age (p <0.001), current angina pectoris (p = 0.002), ejection fraction >40% to <50% (as opposed to >50%) (p <0.001), and diuretic (p <0.001) and digitalis use (p <0.001). Negative predictors included having prior coronary revascularization (p = 0.01) and being female (p = 0.02) or Caucasian (p = 0.006). Trandolapril neither increased nor decreased SCD. Thus, among patients with stable CAD with preserved left ventricular systolic function receiving current standard-of-care including coronary revascularization, clinical characteristics can identify individuals at higher risk for SCD.",

    "8": "Evidence from various studies has shown that even a very small reduction in the blood pressure explains the majority of benefits in cardiovascular outcomes. Although doxazosin is a relatively old drug, it is a very effective add-on therapeutic agent. It has been used in a variety of clinical trials, including different groups of hypertensive patients such as diabetics, the elderly, patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or hypercholesterolaemia, the obese or Afro-Americans and in combination with all major groups of antihypertensive drugs such as: calcium channel antagonists, diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers.",

The two formulations of doxazosin, although chemically identical, appear to differ in some other effects. A large proportion of patients demonstrated a favourable blood pressure response with relatively few treatment-associated side effects showing that this drug appears to be a valuable add-on antihypertensive treatment option. Doxazosin reduces blood pressure and additionally influences other risk factors of coronary heart disease. However, it should be clearly stated that the clinical role of 'beyond blood pressure' effects of doxazosin are largely undetermined.", 
    "12": "Numerous strategies have been evaluated to prevent early CSA-AKI. Although correction of hemodynamic problems is paramount, there are no clinical studies that compare different hemodynamic management or monitoring strategies with regard to their effect on kidney function. Pharmacologic strategies including diuretics, different classes of vasodilators and drugs with anti-inflammatory effects such as N-acetyl-cysteine, do not appear to be effective. Most of the studies are underpowered and use physiological rather than clinical endpoints. Further trials are warranted with fenoldopam and nesiritide (rhBNP). Observational and underpowered randomized studies show beneficial renal effects of off-pump technique and avoidance of aortic manipulation. There is very limited evidence for preoperative fluid loading and preemptive RRT. Potentially nephrotoxic agents should be used with caution in patients at risk of CSA-AKI. Tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid should be preferred over aprotinin. No pharmacologic intervention has been adequately tested in the prevention of late CSA-AKI. A singlecenter study, including a predominance of patients after cardiac surgery, showed a decrease of kidney injury with tight glycemic control.",

These findings suggest that combination ARB and ACE inhibitor therapy is a strategy being used for diabetics with difficult-to-control hypertension, although we cannot determine from our study whether this is primarily for blood pressure control or for renal protection. Whether combining an ACE inhibitor and ARB for blood pressure control alone is supported by the literature may be debatable.

At the end of the placebo period and treatment period, clinical BP, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), plasma insulin, insulin sensitivity (by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp) and plasma fibrinogen were evaluated. Insulin sensitivity was expressed as the amount of glucose infused during the last 30 minutes (glucose infusion rate, GIR) in mg/Kg/min. The total glucose requirement (TGR) to maintain a steady-state blood glucose level in response to a defined increase in plasma insulin concentration was also evaluated.",

    "23": "Although several tumour types express both AT1 and AT2 angiotensin II receptors, and angiotensin II stimulates cell proliferation, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are not effective anti-cancer agents. Development of a biologically active monoclonal antibody (6313/G2) against the AT1 receptor prompted the testing of a recombinant short-chain variable fragment form (R6313/G2) against breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D all expressed both receptor subtypes. In vitro, R6313/G2 suppressed cell proliferation in the presence of 100 nM angiotensin II, with IC50s of 30 nM, 153 nM and 2.8 microM for the three cell types respectively; in contrast, the AT1 receptor blocker losartan was effective only in T47D cells, at 25 microM. Studies on MCF-7 and T47D cells showed R6313/G2 also opposed the angiotensin II-induced inhibition of caspase-3/7 activity. In vivo, hollow fibres containing the cell lines were implanted in nu/nu balb-c mice at two sites, s.c. and i.p. Treatments of R6313/G2 at 2.5 nmol/kg and 25 nmol/kg twice per day for 7 days dose dependently reduced cell numbers for all three cell lines, but here MCF-7 cells responded most sensitively and MDA-MB-231 cells least. Although T47D cells were refractory at the s.c. site, growth was inhibited at the i.p. location, and otherwise results were similar at the two sites. In xenografts, MCF-7 cell tumours were dose dependently reduced by R6313/G2, and 13 and 27 nmol/kg R6313/G2 twice/day gave means of 74 and 76% tumour regression after 7 days. The data suggest that the anti-cancer action of R6313/G2 is considerably more effective than AT1 antagonists.",

Changes in BNP and NT-proBNP from baseline to 6 months maintenance visit were evaluated in each treatment arm. Furthermore, the prognostic value of BNP and NT-proBNP during monotherapy with carvedilol was assessed with univariate Cox proportional hazards models using a combined endpoint of all cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalisation.",

In contrast, no change was observed in the carvedilol group (NT-proBNP 907 to 1,082 pg/ml (P = 0.06), BNP 114 to 130 pg/ml (P = 0.15). The prognostic value of NT-proBNP and BNP was maintained in the carvedilol group (NT-proBNP HR 1.018 95% CI (1.005-1.032), BNP 1.171 (1.088-1.260)).",

    "28": "Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with reduction in both the number and function of vascular progenitor cells. We hypothesized that 1) hypertension abrogates postnatal vasculogenesis, and 2) antihypertensive treatment based on the combination of perindopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and indapamide (diuretic) may counteract hypertension-induced alteration in progenitor cell-related effects. Postischemic neovascularization was significantly lower in untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) compared with Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats (p < 0.05). Treatment of SHRs with perindopril and the combination of perindopril/indapamide reduced the blood pressure levels and normalized vessel growth in ischemic area. Cotreatment with perindopril and indapamide increased vascular endothelial growth factor and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase protein contents, two key proangiogenic factors. It is interesting to note that 14 days after bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) transplantation, revascularization was significantly lower in ischemic SHRs receiving BM-MNCs isolated from SHRs compared with those receiving BM-MNCs isolated from WKY rats (p < 0.05). Alteration in proangiogenic potential of SHR BM-MNCs was probably related to the reduction in their ability to differentiate into endothelial progenitor cells in vitro. Furthermore, the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) was reduced by 3.1-fold in SHRs compared with WKY rats (p < 0.001). Treatments with perindopril or perindopril/indapamide restored the ability of BM-MNCs to differentiate in vitro into EPCs, increased the number of circulating EPCs, and re-established BM-MNC proangiogenic effects. Therefore, hypertension is associated with a decrease in the number of circulating progenitor cells and in the BM-MNC proangiogenic potential, probably leading to vascular complications in this setting. The combination of perindopril and indapamide counteracts hypertension-induced alterations in progenitor cell-related effects and restores blood vessel growth.", 
    "29": "The development of aliskiren, the first orally effective renin inhibitor, utilized molecular modeling based upon X-ray crystallographic analysis of renin's active site to design a potent, low molecular weight renin inhibitor with improved bioavailability (approximately 2.6%). In patients with hypertension, dose-dependent BP reduction occurs with aliskiren 75-300 mg once daily; at these doses, the safety and tolerability profile is comparable to placebo. In direct comparison studies, BP reduction with aliskiren is equivalent to commonly used antihypertensive agents including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs. Persistent BP reduction and prolonged suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) is observed after aliskiren withdrawal. Aliskiren suppresses PRA when given either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. When added to an ARB, aliskiren blocks compensatory RAS activation and produces significant additional BP reduction. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, addition of aliskiren to losartan, 100 mg resulted in a 20% greater reduction in proteinuria. Ongoing studies evaluating the long-term renal protective effects of aliskiren and its effects on ventricular remodeling are currently planned or underway.", 
    "30": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has a well defined place in the treatment of systolic heart failure (HF). Evidence for routine prescription of an ACE inhibitor in patients with diastolic HF (DHF) is inconsistent. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the prognostic impact of ACE inhibitor in patients with DHF. The present prospective study included patients with normal or slightly impaired ejection fraction (> or =50%) surviving a first hospitalization for HF. We assessed the long-term prognosis of these patients according to prescription of an ACE inhibitor at discharge. ACE inhibitor therapy prescribed at discharge in 46% (n = 165) of the 358 included patients was associated with a 30% relative decrease in the risk of 5-year mortality (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.93, p = 0.013). On multivariable Cox analysis, the relation between ACE inhibitor prescription and mortality remained significant (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.99, p = 0.045). Using propensity score analysis, 120 patients receiving an ACE inhibitor were matched with 120 patients not receiving this medication. In the postmatch group, prescription of ACE inhibitor was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of 5-year mortality (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.87, p = 0.006). Five-year relative survival (observed/expected survival) of the ACE inhibitor group was better than that of the no-ACE inhibitor group (65% vs 57%). In conclusion, we demonstrate that in this cohort of patients with DHF, prescription of ACE inhibitor was associated with a significant decrease in long-term mortality.",

Optional hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) addition was allowed from week 8 for inadequate BP control (> or = 140/90 mmHg). The primary objective was to assess the safety of combination therapy; potassium elevations were a predefined safety outcome. BP was measured at regular intervals during the study.", 
    "33": "At the 6-month cut-off date, 512 patients (85.2%) were still ongoing with study treatment, and 192 patients had received at least one dose of HCTZ add-on during this period. Combination therapy was generally well-tolerated; the most commonly reported adverse events were headache (7.5%), dizziness (7.3%) and nasopharyngitis (7.2%). Ten patients (2.5%) receiving aliskiren/valsartan and two patients (1.0%) receiving aliskiren/valsartan/HCTZ had serum potassium elevations > 5.5 mmol/L. Only one patient (0.2%) exhibited potassium levels > or = 6.0 mmol/L during this period and the patient was treated with aliskiren/valsartan. Mean msSBP/DBP reductions of 22.3/14.4 mmHg were observed at 6-month endpoint (LOCF analysis) and 73.4% of patients achieved BP control (< 140/90 mmHg; LOCF).", 
    "34": "Although lack of an active comparator group is a limitation of the study, our findings show that long-term treatment with the aliskiren/valsartan 300/320-mg combination provided clinically significant BP lowering, was well-tolerated and was associated with a very low rate of potassium elevations in patients with hypertension.", 
    "35": "1. The epidemic of diabetes is accelerating and the World Health Organization estimates that the number of people affected worldwide will grow from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million by 2030. 2. The main causes of death and disability in individuals with type 2 diabetes are macrovascular and microvascular disease, and blood pressure is one of the main determinants of vascular complications in this population. 3. While randomized trials have demonstrated that blood pressure lowering reduces vascular complications in subjects with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, ADVANCE was designed to determine whether the addition of a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide, on top of comprehensive and effective cardiovascular treatments and glucose control therapy, would produce further benefits, irrespective of the initial blood pressure. 4. The blood pressure lowering arm of ADVANCE has demonstrated that the simple addition of the fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide compared to matching placebo, significantly reduces combined macrovascular and microvascular complications by 9%, all-cause mortality by 14% and cardiovascular death by 18%. It also reduces total coronary events by 14% and all renal events and microalbuminuria by 21%. 5. Similar benefits were observed in participant sub-groups characterized by age, sex, baseline blood pressure, previous vascular diseases and concomitant cardiovascular therapy including blood pressure lowering therapy. 6. Successful implementation of this treatment, with a single combination tablet of perindopril and indapamide, should be practical and affordable in most clinical settings worldwide and has the capacity to save countless lives and to reduce the burden of coronary disease and renal disease burden among millions of people with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "36": "1. Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties. Molecular modelling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have led to the development of new orally active renin inhibitors, such as aliskiren. 2. Aliskiren has a low bioavailability (between 2.6 and 5.0%) compensated by its high potency to inhibit renin (IC50: 0.6 nmol/L) and a long plasma half-life (23-36 h), which makes it suitable for once-daily dosing. 3. The once-daily administration of aliskiren to hypertensive patients lowers BP as strongly as standard doses of established angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (losartan, valsartan, irbesartan), hydrochlorothiazide, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ramipril and lisinopril) or long acting calcium channel blockers (amlodipine). In combination therapy, aliskiren further decreases blood pressure when combined with either hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan or ramipril. 4. The biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and Ang II antagonism, particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the bradykinin-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway and possibly the (pro)renin receptor. 5. Blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) with ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers or a combination of these drugs has become one of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine. However, it remains unclear how to optimize RAS blockade to maximize cardiovascular and renal benefits. In this context, renin inhibition to render the RAS fully quiescent is a new possibility requiring further study.",

    "38": "Three hundred nineteen consecutive DCM patients were evaluated after adequate stabilization on optimal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (88%) and beta-blocker (82%) therapy. Frequency, length, and rate of NSVT at 24-hour Holter monitoring were analyzed to assess their values in predicting MVA (unexpected sudden death, SVT, ventricular fibrillation, and appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator interventions). During follow-up (median 96 months, 1(st)-3(rd) interquartile range 52-130), MVA incidence was low, and not statistically different between patients with and without NSVT (3 and 2 per 100 patient-years, respectively, P = nonsignificant [NS] at log-rank analysis). At multivariable analysis, the number of NSVT was predictive of MVA only if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was > 0.35 (two NSVT/day vs no NSVT/day: hazard ratio [HR] 5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-17.85 in LVEF > 0.35 vs HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.3-2.81 in LVEF < or = 0.35). Consequently, in patients with LVEF < or = 0.35, MVA incidence rates were similar regardless of NSVT (3.6 and 4.1 patient-years, respectively, in those with and without NSVT, P = NS), while in patients with LVEF > 0.35, MVA incidence (3.1 per 100 patient-years vs 0.9 per 100 patient-years, P = 0.003) was significantly higher when NSVT were present.", 
    "39": "After medical stabilization, NSVT did not increase the risk of MVA in patients with DCM and LVEF < or = 0.35. Conversely, the number and length of NSVT runs were significantly related to the occurrence of MVA in the patients with LVEF > 0.35.", 
    "40": "An anaphylactoid reaction to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is an uncommon but fatal complication. A 39-year-old man was admitted within 1 hour of the onset of a right hemispheric stroke. He was not taking any specific medication, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. A systemic anaphylactoid reaction developed immediately after rt-PA infusion. However, the symptoms were improved after treatment with a steroid and antihistamine. Subsequent intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy resulted in complete recanalization and clinical improvement. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a life-threatening anaphylactoid reaction after rt-PA treatment followed by successful intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in a patient who had not taken an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "41": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of therapy by perindopril or telmisartan on endothelial/platelet function and on coagulation/fibrinolysis in 20 and 16 hypertensive patients, respectively. The measurements were carried out before and after 1 month of therapy. Both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were reduced (P<0.001) or normalized due to each therapy. Plasma thrombomodulin (TM) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) as indicators of endothelial dysfunction, plasma beta-thromboglobulin (betaTG), platelet factor 4 (PF4), soluble P-selectin (sPsel) and soluble glycoprotein V (sGpV) as indicators of in vivo platelet activation, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen and tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen as markers of fibrinolytic activity, soluble endothelial protein C receptor (sEPCR) as a new marker of hypercoagulation and fibrinogen level as a known risk factor for vascular changes were investigated. A decrease of plasma vWF, sPsel, sGpV, PAI-1 and tPA antigen level (P<0.05, respectively) after 1 month of therapy by perindopril was observed. On the other hand, a decrease of plasma sEPCR and fibrinogen level (P<0.05, respectively) after 1 month of therapy by telmisartan was found. We failed to find changes of plasma TM, betaTG and PF4 due to any therapy investigated. The additional beneficial 'antithrombotic' effects of the renin-angiotensin system targeting agents (vasculoprotective, anti-platelet and profibrinolytic effects of perindopril and anticoagulant/rheological effects of telmisartan) may be important in terms of the favourable role of antihypertensive drugs in cardiovascular morbidity.",

Experiments were performed in beta1/beta2-adrenergic receptor-deficient mice (beta1/beta2ADR-/-) to assess whether this pathway is required for circadian variation in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and to determine the impact of its loss on the response to changes in dietary salt. Twenty-four-hour recordings of MAP, heart rate (HR), and locomotor activity were made in conscious 16- to 17-wk-old mice [wild-type, (WT), n = 7; beta1/beta2ADR-/-, n = 10] by telemetry. Both WT and beta1/beta2ADR-/- mice demonstrated robust circadian variation in MAP and HR, although 24-h mean MAP was 10% lower (102.02 +/- 1.81 vs. 92.11 +/- 2.62 mmHg) in beta1/beta2ADR-/- than WT, HR was 16% lower and day-night differences reduced. Both WT and beta1/beta2ADR-/- mice adapted to changed salt intake without changed MAP. However, the beta1/beta2ADR-/- mice demonstrated a striking reduction in locomotor activity in light and dark phases of the day. In WT mice, MAP was markedly affected by locomotor activity, resulting in bimodal distributions in both light and dark. When MAP was analyzed using only intervals without locomotor activity, bimodality and circadian differences were reduced, and there was no significant difference between the two genotypes. The results indicate that there is no direct effect or role for the beta-adrenergic system in circadian variation of arterial pressure in mice, aside from the indirect consequences of altered locomotor activity. Our results also confirm that locomotor activity contributes strongly to circadian variation in blood pressure in mice.",

Patients who had pneumonia and congenital heart disease or systemic hypertension or renal and liver disease together were excluded from the study. Blood gas analysis and oxygen concentration, measured with pulse oximetry, were performed in all patients. Besides chest X-ray, electrocardiography and echocardiographic search was also carried out. Echocardiographic examination was performed by using M mode, two-dimensional echocardiography and colored Doppler sonotron Vingmed CFM 725. At echocardiographic examination, pulmonary hypertension is defined as above 35 mmHg of pulmonary artery pressure. For echocardiographic examination, patients with pulmonary hypertension were divided into two groups. Captopril (2 mg/kg/day, three doses a day) and nifedipine (0.5 mg/kg/day, three doses a day) were given to the first and the second group, respectively. Echocardiography was performed daily until normal pulmonary artery pressure was achieved. At the beginning of the treatment, the patients were treated with double antibiotics and antibiotic change was carried out in needed cases at the follow up. Digoxin was administered to the cases of respiratory infection with heart failure.", 
    "44": "Perindopril Erbumine (PER) is one of the newly used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and is used for the treatment of patients with hypertension and symptomatic heart failure. It has two main degradation pathways, i.e. the degradation by hydrolysis and the degradation by cyclization. An isothermal heat conduction microcalorimetry (MC) and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used for the characterization of aqueous solutions of PER and its stability properties. The rates of heat evolved during degradation of perindopril were measured by MC as a function of temperature and pH and from these data rate constant and change in enthalpy of the reactions were determined. With the HPLC method the concentration of perindopril and its degradation products were measured as a function of time in aqueous solutions of different pH that were stored at different temperatures. We demonstrated that reactions of degradation of perindopril at observed conditions follow the first order kinetics. The Arrhenius equation for each pH was determined. At pH 6.8 only one degradation pathway is present, i.e. the degradation by hydrolysis. Degradation constants for this pathway calculated from MC data are in good agreement with those obtained from HPLC. MC as a non-specific technique was shown to be useful in studies of PER when one reaction was present in the sample and also when more chemical and physical processes were simultaneously running.",

The combination of diuretics with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) antagonists offers several advantages to include additive BP-lowering efficacy and enhanced reductions in urinary protein excretion. Thiazide diuretics are associated with metabolic complications that are particularly evident when used in high doses.

    "57": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) exerts beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in part by exerting antioxidant activity. Given that oxidant stress is a key cause of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes, we investigated whether ANP improves endothelial function in rats with diabetes. Rats were injected with streptozotocin (55 mg/kg iv) to induce type 1 diabetes or the citrate vehicle as controls (n=12). After 4 weeks the diabetic rats were treated with ANP (10 pmol/kg/min sc, n=12) or the antioxidant tempol (1.5 mmol/kg/day sc, n=11), both by osmotic minipump, ramipril (1 mg/kg per day in the drinking water) or remained untreated (n=11). After a further 4 weeks, anaesthetised rats were killed by exsanguination and the thoracic aortae collected for examination of vascular activity and measurement of superoxide generation. Diabetic rats showed elevated plasma glucose concentration (45+/-3 mM) compared to controls (10+/-1 mM) and this was not affected by ANP (43+/-3 mM), ramipril (41+/-2 mM) or tempol (43+/-2 mM). Endothelium-dependent relaxation ex vivo in response to acetylcholine was impaired in diabetic rats (Rmax=66+/-4%) compared to control rats (Rmax=94+/-1%) but treatment with ANP (Rmax=80+/-4%), ramipril (Rmax=88+/-2%) or tempol (Rmax=81+/-5%) significantly improved those responses. Relaxant responses to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside were enhanced by treatment of diabetic rats with ANP or ramipril and their combination; but not by tempol. Superoxide generation was significantly elevated in aorta from untreated diabetic rats (649+/-146% of control). In diabetic rats, superoxide generation was significantly attenuated by ANP (to 229+/-78%) or tempol (to 186+/-64%). This study demonstrates that ANP improves vascular oxidant stress in concert with endothelial function, independent of any effect on plasma glucose levels. These studies may lead to new therapies, based on natriuretic peptide and/or antioxidant approaches, for ameliorating the vascular complications of diabetes.", 
    "58": "The causes of angioedema are not well described, especially in the inpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to examine the causes of moderate to severe angioedema in patients requiring inpatient treatment. We performed a retrospective review in patients requiring inpatient consultation by the Division of Allergy and Immunology at our institution between 1995 and 2004. We focused on potential interactions among medications that elicited life-threatening angioedema requiring intubation. The allergy/immunology service was consulted on 69 patients with moderate to severe angioedema. Medications were the most common cause of angioedema (n = 64, 93%). In most cases (n = 46, 67%), the angioedema was attributed to two or more medications. Patients previously stable on ACE inhibitors (ACEI), aspirin (ASA), or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) appeared more likely to develop angioedema soon after the addition of another drug (i.e., ACEI, ASA/NSAIDs, direct mast cell degranulators, and antibiotics). ACEI, ASA/NSAID, and direct mast cell degranulators were contributing causes in 36 patients (56%), 45 patients (70%), and 23 patients (36%), respectively. Twenty patients required intubation, 14 (70%) patients were on ACEI, 12 (60%) patients were on ASA/NSAID, and 7 (35%) patients were on direct mast cell degranulators. ACEI, ASA/NSAID, or direct mast cell degranulators were a cause in 95% (n = 19) of patients requiring intubation. The combination of ACEI and ASA/NSAID was the most frequent cause of angioedema among all patients (n = 17, 25%) and those requiring intubation (n = 8, 40%). Moderate to severe angioedema often is a result of interactions between two or more medications involved in different pathways causing angioedema. In particular, combinations of ACEI, ASA/NSAID, or direct mast cell degranulators may lead to life-threatening angioedema requiring intubation.",

The antinociceptive effect produced by the [Leu(5)]enkephalin in rats pretreated with any combination of two peptidase inhibitors was significantly smaller than that in rats pretreated with the three peptidase inhibitors, indicating that any residual single peptidase could inactivate significant amounts of the [Leu(5)]enkephalin.

Recently, we and others demonstrated intracellular synthesis of ANG II in cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells that was dramatically stimulated in high glucose conditions. Cardiac fibroblasts significantly contribute to diabetes-induced diastolic dysfunction. The objective of the present study was to determine the existence of the intracellular RAS in cardiac fibroblasts and its role in extracellular matrix deposition. Neonatal rat ventricular fibroblasts were serum starved and exposed to isoproterenol or high glucose in the absence or presence of candesartan, which was used to prevent receptor-mediated uptake of ANG II. Under these conditions, an increase in ANG II levels in the cell lysate represented intracellular synthesis. Both isoproterenol and high glucose significantly increased intracellular ANG II levels. Confocal microscopy revealed perinuclear and nuclear distribution of intracellular ANG II. Consistent with intracellular synthesis, Western analysis showed increased intracellular levels of renin following stimulation with isoproterenol and high glucose. ANG II synthesis was catalyzed by renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), but not chymase, as determined using specific inhibitors. High glucose resulted in increased transforming growth factor-beta and collagen-1 synthesis by cardiac fibroblasts that was partially inhibited by candesartan but completely prevented by renin and ACE inhibitors. In conclusion, cardiac fibroblasts contain a functional intracellular RAS that participates in extracellular matrix formation in high glucose conditions, an observation that may be helpful in developing an appropriate therapeutic strategy in diabetic conditions.",

Numerous studies have indicated that current approaches are inadequate. Here, we report the development of an external RNA control approach. It is the first to add external RNA to tissue on a per unit weight basis, and we demonstrate its accuracy, suitability, and necessity in experiments involving severe physiological challenges. We utilized the approach to examine the expression of the internal RNA control genes (reference genes) beta-actin, cyclophilin A, and glyceraldehyde 3-phospate dehydrogenase in brain and heart of normoxic and anoxic crucian carp (Carassius carassius). The internal RNA control genes differed significantly in expression in experimental groups, especially in heart. We also demonstrate that the external RNA control approach provides a more accurate normalization of target genes. For example, it revealed a 2.5-fold increase in the expression of the stress-response gene HSC70, which was not detected using beta-actin or geNorm. Further, we demonstrate and discuss the need for using the optimized and standardized external RNA control protocol reported. Collectively, our data suggest that the normalization of real-time RT PCR data is considerably improved by adding an external RNA control to the samples.",

With the increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of dementia is expected to reach 81.1 million persons by 2040. Dementia impairs quality of life and is associated with profound disease burden, morbidity, and mortality in both patients and caregivers. Therefore, identifying measures to prevent dementia is a research priority. Midlife hypertension has increased the risk of dementia in large prospective cohort studies. Researchers have investigated the blood pressure-lowering effects of antihypertensive drugs on the incidence of dementia. Although prospective cohort studies have shown that use of antihypertensive drugs was associated with a reduced rate of cognitive impairment and dementia, these studies were not placebo controlled. Four randomized, placebo-controlled studies-the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) study, Study on Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly (SCOPE), Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), and Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS)-investigated the effects of antihypertensive agents on the incidence of dementia. The Syst-Eur study found that active treatment with nitrendipine, enalapril, and/or hydrochlorothiazide reduced the rate of dementia by 50% compared with placebo (p=0.05). The PROGRESS study showed that active treatment with perindopril and indapamide was associated with reduced cognitive decline compared with placebo (risk ratio 19%, p=0.01). In contrast, the SCOPE study (candesartan or hydrochlorothiazide vs placebo) and the SHEP trial (chlorthalidone, atenolol, or reserpine vs placebo) found no significant difference between the active treatment and placebo groups on the incidence of dementia. Some researchers have suggested that certain antihypertensive drug classes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers, may offer benefit in reducing dementia risk in addition to their blood pressure-lowering effect. Further prospective randomized studies comparing different antihypertensive classes are needed to provide more evidence regarding the effects of antihypertensive drugs on dementia risk and to determine whether certain antihypertensive classes provide greater benefits than others.", 
    "97": "The contractile effects of angiotensinogen (Aogen) and its metabolization pathways were studied on rat renal vein (RRV), rat pulmonary artery (RPA) and human umbilical vein (HUV) rings. Experiments were made in the presence or in the absence of pepstatin A (a renin inhibitor, 10 microM), captopril (an ACE inhibitor, 10 microM), chymostatin (a chymase inhibitor, 10 microM), amastatin (an aminopeptidase-A and -M inhibitor) or losartan (a specific AT1 blocker, 10 microM). On all rings, Aogen-induced contractions were reduced by pepstatin A or captopril, amplified by amastatin and blocked by losartan. Chymostatin had a stronger inhibitory effect than captopril on HUV and simultaneous administering of chymostatin and captopril prevented Aogen contractile effects on HUV. It is suggested that all studied vessels possess a local renin-angiotensin system and possibility of angiotensin II production within the vessel walls using various and species-dependent enzymatic pathways.",

Serial measures of NT-proBNP are more valuable than single measures for prognosis, and biologic variation of the marker should allow serial monitoring. Furthermore, given that NT-proBNP levels decrease in response to the addition of therapies with proven benefit for HF (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, spironolactone, exercise therapy, and biventricular pacing), it is logical to expect that targeting therapy to decrease NT-proBNP levels may facilitate more optimal use of proven HF therapies and may reduce adverse clinical outcomes. The optimal strategy for NT-proBNP monitoring with regard to frequency of testing or whether to use standard or individualized targets is still being determined. Preliminary results are promising for targeting an outpatient NT-proBNP concentration of approximately < or =1,000 ng/L. Current data suggest that when NT-proBNP levels are not at goal or increase from prior measurements, the risk for hazard is increased.

Those who received prescription drug coverage without deductibles or copayments lived an average of 8.56 quality-adjusted life-years and incurred $111,600 in coronary heart disease-related costs. Compared with current prescription drug coverage, full coverage for post-myocardial infarction secondary prevention therapies would result in greater functional life expectancy (0.35 quality-adjusted life-year) and less resource use ($2500).

It is also acknowledged that the genotype frequency of certain gene polymorphisms varies across different ethnic groups and that a difference in gene polymorphism frequencies between healthy and heart failure patients seems to exist.", 
    "160": "This study investigated associations between 10 gene polymorphisms of RAAS-related genes with an individual's susceptibility to heart failure. Our data suggest that the angiotensinogen (AGT) 235 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may be associated with heart failure in our population and that the AGT(M174)-AGT(T235) haplotype, as well as the AGT/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene combination, may play an important role in disease predisposition.", 
    "161": "Racial differences in survival outcomes point towards a genetic role in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Furthermore, contemporary evidence links genetics to heart failure (HF) predisposition. We tested for a difference in prevalence of 10 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-related gene polymorphisms between a homogenous population of HF patients and healthy controls.", 
    "162": "One hundred and eleven healthy volunteers and 58 HF patients were included in this study. The healthy control group consisted of males aged between 18 and 35 years old. The HF group consisted of patients (89.7% male) who were 63.8 +/- 7.9 years old, were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III and had a documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <or= 40% within the previous 6 months. Despite being treated maximally for their condition with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-adrenoceptor blockers, they continued to be symptomatic and, as such, were a highly specialized and homogeneous patient population. Both groups were composed of Canadian Caucasians. The analyzed polymorphisms were: ACE (I/D), angiotensin-II-receptor-type-1 (AGTR1)(A1166C), angiotensinogen (AGT)(M235T and T174M), endothelial-nitric-oxide-synthase (eNOS)(T-786C and Glu298Asp), adrenergic-receptor-\u00e22 (ADRB2)(Gln27Glu), bradykinin-receptor-beta2 (BDKRB2)(+9/-9), aldosterone-synthase (CYP11B2)(T-344C) and adducin-1 (ADD1)(Gly460Trp). RESULTS The AGT (T235) allele (P = 0.0025, OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.24, 3.30) was found to be more prevalent in our HF group. The AGT (174M)-AGT (235T) haplotype was also associated with the HF phenotype (P = 0.0069). Exploratory evaluation of gene-gene combinations revealed an indicative association of the AGT (T235)/ACE(D) combined polymorphisms in the HF group (P = 0.02, OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.11, 4.06).",

The median persistence time was 20 months. The data were little different from the population average with respect to A2RAs or ACEIs, but persistence was 57% poorer with respect to CCBs (log-rank P < 0.001) (28% of patients prescribed CCBs failed to collect a second prescription; median persistence time, 7 months). There were differences in persistence between individual drugs in the respective classes, the best outcomes being with candesartan and telmisartan (A2RAs; 10%-20% better), perindopril (ACEI; 25% better) and lercanidipine (CCB; 25% better). Median MPRs were generally around 100%, indicating that most patients who collected prescriptions also showed good adherence to treatment regimens.",

    "169": "Many patients affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) die before reaching endstage renal disease because of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent guidelines and position statements have therefore defined CKD as a cardiovascular risk equivalent, and patients in all stages of CKD are considered in the highest risk group for development of CVD. Heart failure (HF) is the main cardiovascular complication that occurs in renal patients and its incidence increases proportionally with the reduction of glomerular filtration rate. In fact, pressure and volume overload, that are inherent to the abnormalities of homeostasis typical of CKD, lead to concentric/eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Initially, LVH is adaptative because energy is spared by maintaining stable wall stress. However, in the long term, LVH becomes maladaptative, inducing systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction that, in turn, lead to symptomatic left ventricular failure. Nowadays, it is well established that several classes of drugs, including reninangiotensin system antagonists, beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists, improve survival in patients with HF. In fact, all major guidelines on HF recommend such drugs as standard therapy. The problem for nephrologists is that the general approach and recommendations for the management of HF in the general population may not be completely safe in renal patients with HF. This review is conducted with the purpose to provide more information on the efficacy and safety of HF therapy in renal patients.", 
    "170": "The purpose of this study was to explore the role of L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-HTP) and its relationship with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on the drinking behavior in Japanese quails. Normally-hydrated quails that received injections of L-HTP (12.5; 25 and 50 mg.kg-1) by the intracoelomic route (ic) expressed an increase in water intake, which was inhibited by captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In addition, captopril also induced such a response in birds under previous fluid deprivation. High doses of captopril (35-70 mg.kg-1, sc) in normally-hydrated quails decreased the spontaneous water intake while low doses of captopril (2-5 mg.kg-1, sc) did not prompt water intake after L-HTP administration. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist in mammals, did not change the water intake levels in normally-hydrated or water-deprivated birds. Serotonin (5-HT) injections did not provoke its known dipsogenic response.",

    "172": "Endothelial dysfunction crucially contributes to the development of impaired coronary and systemic perfusion as well as reduced exercise capacity in patients with congestive heart failure, with fundamental impact on morbidity and mortality. Reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and abundant formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the vascular wall are the key determinants in endothelial dysfunction. The imbalance between NO and ROS mainly results from neurohumoral activation associated with heart failure. As endothelial derived NO is a major endogenous modulator of platelet function, reduced intravascular bioactivity of NO contributes to platelet activation, adhesion and thromboembolic events in heart failure. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin and aldosterone antagonists, and statins beneficially modulates endothelial dysfunction in heart failure. All these therapies increase NO bioactivity by either modulation of ROS generation, thereby preventing the interaction of superoxide anions with NO, and/or increasing endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression/activity. AVE9488, a novel eNOS transcription enhancer, attenuates cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction in rats after large myocardial infarction. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels and their mobilization are regulated by eNOS. After myocardial infarction in rats, EPC levels and formation of endothelial colony forming units are markedly reduced. AVE 9488, ACE or HMG-CoA reductase inhibition result in significant increases in EPC levels, and beneficial effects on bone marrow molecular alterations after myocardial infarction.", 
    "173": "Prostanoids are cyclic lipid mediators which arise from enzymic cyclooxygenation of linear polyunsaturated fatty acids, e.g. arachidonic acid (20:4 n 6, AA). Biologically active prostanoids deriving from AA include stable prostaglandins (PGs), e.g. PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), PGD(2), PGJ(2) as well as labile prostanoids, i.e. PG endoperoxides (PGG(2), PGH(2)), thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) and prostacyclin (PGI(2)). A \"Rabbit aorta Contracting Substance\" (RCS) played important role in discovering of labile PGs. RCS was discovered in the Vane's Cascade as a labile product released along with PGs from the activated lung or spleen. RCS was identified as a mixture of PG endoperoxides and thromboxane A(2). Stable PGs regulate the cell cycle, smooth muscle tone and various secretory functions; they also modulate inflammatory and immune reactions. PG endoperoxides are intermediates in biosynthesis of all prostanoids. Thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) is the most labile prostanoid (with a half life of 30 s at 37 degrees C). It is generated mainly by blood platelets. TXA(2) is endowed with powerful vasoconstrictor, cytotoxic and thrombogenic properties. Again the Vane's Cascade was behind the discovery of prostacyclin (PGI(2)) with a half life of 4 min at 37 degrees C. It is produced by the vascular wall (predominantly by the endothelium) and it acts as a physiological antagonist of TXA(2). Moreover, prostacyclin per se is a powerful cytoprotective agent that exerts its action through activation of adenylate cyclase, followed by an intracellular accumulation of cyclic-AMP in various types of cells. In that respect PGI(2) collaborates with the system consisting of NO synthase (eNOS)/nitric oxide free radical (NO)/guanylate cyclase/cyclic-GMP. Both cyclic nucleotides (c-AMP and c-GMP) act in synergy as two energetic fists which defend the cellular machinery from being destroyed by endogenous or exogenous aggressors. Recently, a new partner has been recognized in this endogenous defensive squadron, i.e. a system consisting of heme oxygenase (HO-1)/carbon monoxide (CO)/biliverdin/biliverdin reductase/bilirubin. The expanding knowledge on the pharmacological steering of this enzymic triad (PGI(2)-S/eNOS/HO-1) is likely to contribute to the rational therapy of many systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension or Alzheimer diseases. The discovery of prostacyclin broadened our pathophysiological horizon, and by itself opened new therapeutic possibilities. Prostacyclin sodium salt and its synthetic stable analogues (iloprost, beraprost, treprostinil, epoprostenol, cicaprost) are useful drugs for the treatment of the advanced critical limb ischemia, e.g. in the course of Buerger's disease, and also for the treatment of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). In this last case a synergism between prostacyclin analogues and sildenafil (a selective phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor) or bosentan (an endothelin ET-1 receptor antagonist) points our to complex mechanisms controlling pulmonary circulation. At the Jagiellonian University we have demonstrated that several well recognised cardiovascular drugs, e.g. ACE inhibitors (ACE-I), statins, some of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, e.g. carvedilol or nebivolol, anti-platelet thienopyridines (ticlopidine, clopidogrel) and a metabolite of vitamin PP--N(1)-methyl-nicotinamide--all of them are endowed with the in vivo PGI(2)-releasing properties. In this way, the foundations for the Endothelial Pharmacology were laid.", 
    "174": "We previously reported that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) decrease the rate of cognitive decline in elderly patients with hypertension, but their impact on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not known. A total of 62 elderly patients with AD were enrolled, and 52 completed the study for 6 months. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Clock Draw Test (CDT), working memory (Digit Ordering), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale, and the Screen for Caregiver Burden (SCB) were collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. AD patients receiving ACEI (N = 15) demonstrated a slower rate of decline in digit forward (P = .003) and IADL scale (P = .003) and an improved measure of caregiver burden (P = .04) but not MMSE (P =.15) or CDT (P =.9) compared with those not receiving ACEI after adjusting for other risk factors. This study suggests that use of ACEI in AD patients is associated with slower rate of AD progression. A randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm our finding.", 
    "175": "Recent epidemiological studies have shown a J-shaped association between the risk of stroke and systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrating that perindopril-based blood pressure (BP) lowering reduced the risk of stroke in 6105 participants with prior cerebrovascular disease. We estimated the effects of therapy on the risk of recurrent stroke in 1757 of these participants with stage 3 or greater CKD according to baseline BP and the relationship between achieved follow-up BP and the risk of stroke. Active therapy produced comparable and significant reductions in the risk of stroke across all baseline SBP levels. The age- and gender-adjusted incidence of stroke increased significantly in a log-linear relationship for achieved SBP levels and strokes per 1000 person-years. This association persisted after adjusting for potential confounding factors. We found that perindopril-based BP lowering effectively prevented recurrent stroke in people with CKD, across a wide range of BP levels, without evidence of an increased risk of stroke in people with low BP levels.", 
    "176": "A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether the omission of angiotensin converting inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIA) before cardiac surgery leads to avoidance of postoperative vasodilation. Using the reported search 421 papers were identified. Eleven papers including three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) represented the best evidence on the subject. The author, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study comments and weaknesses were tabulated for these. Whereas the three small RCTs on this topic provided conflicting evidence, the remaining seven large cohort and case-control studies confirmed that preoperative ACEI therapy resulted in postoperative low systemic vascular resistance (SVR)/vasoplegia. Only two small RCTs with conflicting conclusions specifically addressed the issue of omitting ACEI/AIIA before cardiac surgery. We conclude that preoperative administration of ACEI/AIIA in patients undergoing cardiac surgery contributes to lowering of SVR/vasoplegia postoperatively thereby making omission of ACEI/AIIA before cardiac surgery a rational strategy to avoid postoperative vasodilation. However, the current available evidence to support this strategy is weak.", 
    "177": "Extracts of different polarities (dichloromethane, methanol, and aqueous extracts) from 5 Yemeni medicinal plants (Aspilia helianthoides, leaves; Ceropegia rupicola, whole plant; Kniphofia sumarae, whole plant; Pavetta longiflora, leaves; and Plectranthus cf barbatus, leaves) were screened for their inhibitory effects against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), neutral endopeptidase (NEP), and aminopeptidase N (APN) activities. Four extracts (methanol extracts of Ceropegia rupicola, Kniphofia sumarae, and Plectranthus cf barbatus, and the aqueous extract of Pavetta longiflora) were found able to inhibit the enzymatic activity of NEP. Significant reduction in the activity of NEP (p < 0.01) was observed at a concentration of 50 microg/ml, and above of all tested extracts. The most active extract was the methanolic extract of Ceropegia rupicola with IC50 of 111 microg/ml. Only the methanolic extract of Aspilia helianthoides was found to exhibit inhibitory effect against the ACE activity with IC50 = 133 microg/ml. None of the tested plant extracts was found active against the aminopeptidase N activity.", 
    "178": "Many patients with acute heart failure have marked hypertension and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. In these patients, the heart failure usually does not result from transient systolic dysfunction or valvular abnormalities but rather results from diastolic dysfunction. Treatment of this condition includes control of hypertension, cautious diuresis, and, if necessary, ventilatory support. Further workup after the acute phase should be directed by the overall clinical picture. Other potential contributing factors, such as renal artery stenosis, valvular heart disease, and ischemia, should be strongly considered. Unfortunately, chronic therapy for diastolic heart failure has not yet been standardized due to the paucity of clinical trial data. Strict control of hypertension appears to be of paramount importance. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or receptor blockers may be of benefit in preventing repeat hospitalizations.",

We assessed whether these relationships persist in patients with established CHD treated with evidence-based preventive pharmacologic therapies.", 
    "180": "We performed a cross-sectional study of 74 adults with CHD and a body mass index (BMI) of >27 kg m(-2) (mean 32+/-4). The mean age of subjects was 64+/-9 years (range 44-84 years).", 
    "181": "Obesity measures included weight, BMI, waist, fat mass, intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat.

Medication use included aspirin (99%), statin (84%), beta-blocker (71%), ACE inhibitor or blocker (37%) and clopidogrel (28%).", 
    "182": "There was no direct relationship between obesity parameters and risk factor measures of lipid concentrations, blood pressure, clotting abnormalities or platelet reactivity except for a modest relationship between visceral fat and hs-CRP (r=0.30, P=0.02). However, increased BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, total abdominal fat and abdominal subcutaneous fat all correlated with insulin sensitivity (r-values -0.30 to -0.45, P-values 0.01 to <0.001) and insulin concentrations. Insulin sensitivity, in turn, was the best predictor of PAI-1, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, cholesterol/HDL levels (all P<0.01) and platelet reactivity (R=0.34, P=0.02).", 
    "183": "Use of preventive pharmacologic therapies obviated the expected relationship between adiposity and CHD risk factors. However, a residual effect of insulin resistance is left untreated. Total adiposity and central adiposity were strong predictors of insulin sensitivity, which in turn predicted cardiac risk factors such as lipid concentrations, PAI-1 and platelet reactivity. Thus, while evidence-based pharmacologic treatments may diminish the statistical relationship between obesity and many cardiac risk factors, adiposity negatively impacts CHD risk by reducing tissue insulin sensitivity.",

RAS blocking agents efficiently control post-transplant hypertension and are useful to reduce proteinuria and for treating post-transplant erythrocytosis. However, RAS blockade is associated with some potentially relevant adverse events as hyperkalemia, anemia, and even to a decline in renal function. There are consistent experimental data showing that RAS blockade has a therapeutic effect on chronic allograft injury. Some clinical studies have shown that RAS blockade reduces transforming growth factor-beta1 and other markers of fibrosis but, up to now, there is not convincing evidence supporting that RAS blockade has further benefit on the progression of chronic allograft injury in comparison with other antihypertensive interventions. Theoretically, RAS blockade may also improve cardiovascular disease, which constitutes the main cause of mortality and morbidity in renal allograft recipients. Nevertheless, to date there is lack of evidence for supporting that RAS blockade improves neither graft nor patient survival in comparison with other antihypertensive drugs. Randomized, prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled trials with enough sample size and follow-up are needed to address the potential role of RAS blockade to improve graft and patient outcome. Meanwhile, we should empirically balance case to case the pros and cons of RAS blockade in renal transplantation.",

Experiments used novel Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectroscopic (MS) assays to study Ang processing. Mass spectroscopy was used to measure proteolytic conversion of Ang peptide substrates to their specific peptide products. We compared ACE/ACE2 activity in plasma, brain and kidney from C57BL/6 and NEP(-/-) mice. Plasma or tissue extracts were incubated with Ang I or Ang II (1296 or 1045, m/z, respectively), and generated peptides were monitored with MS. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity was detected in kidney and brain, but not in plasma. Brain ACE2 activity was highest in hypothalamus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity was inhibited by the specific ACE2 inhibitor, DX600 (10 microm, 99% inhibition), but not by the ACE inhibitor, captopril (10 microm). Both MS and colorimetric assays showed high ACE activity in plasma and kidney with low levels in brain. To extend these findings, ACE measurements were made in ACE overexpressing mice. Angiotensin-converting enzyme four-copy mice showed higher ACE activity in kidney and plasma with low levels in hypothalamus. In hypothalamus from NEP-/- mice, generation of Ang(1-7) from Ang I was decreased, suggesting a role for NEP in Ang metabolism. With Ang II as substrate, there was no difference between NEP-/- and wild-type control mice, indicating that other enzymes may contribute to generation of Ang(1-7). The data suggest a predominant role of hypothalamic ACE2 in the processing of Ang II, in contrast to ACE, which is most active in plasma.",

One older patient diagnosed with Becker muscular dystrophy showed limb-girdle muscular atrophy and weakness at the age of 50, but did not have any cardiac symptoms. Skeletal muscle involvement in each patient remained unchanged, and cardiac function did not worsen in any of the patients during the study. In a younger XLDCM patient, the amount and molecular weight of mutant dystrophin were equally slightly decreased in both skeletal and cardiac muscles. Immunostaining for dystrophin and dystrophin-associated proteins was slightly reduced in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, with no discernible difference between the two.

The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug sirolmus (Srl) lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation. In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown. In this study, long-term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl-based IS. Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil +/- steroids. Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0.13 g/day (range 0-5.7) preswitch to 0.23 g/day (0-9.88) at 24 months postswitch (p = 0.0024). Before the switch, 11.5% of patients had high-grade proteinuria (>1.0 g/day); this increased to 22.9% postswitch (p = 0.006). ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-releasing blocker (ARB) therapy reduced proteinuria development. Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function (median 42.5 vs. 64.1, p = 0.25), whereas patients who developed high-grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow-up (median 39.6 vs. 29.2, p = 0.125). Thus, proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl, which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients.

By the end of follow up the given effect lost its significance, but 5 (38,5%) patients by termination of the study had FC II of CHF, what was accompanied with moderate increase of distance walked during 6-minute walk test from 354 to 378 m. In patients in the group of spironolactone treatment already after 6 months of treatment there occurred decrease of LV volumes, what by the end of period of observation for LV end diastolic volume (EDV) amounted - 76 ( - 118; - 7), and for LV end systolic volume (ESV) - 53 ml ( - 96; - 7) ml ( =0,008) at absolute increment of LVEF by 3 (0; 12)% ( =0,05). In control group in 12 months decrease of LVEDV was less pronounced and LV ESV did not change. Finally after 12 months of observation the groups became to differ by change of LVEF ( =0,035) and LVESV ( =0,02). Changes of LV volumes were followed by lowering of median concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in plasma by - 51,9 ( - 87; - 43,9) mg/ml. At the same time in control group gradual rise of concentration of the given peptide was observed from initial 107,3 to 168,5 mg/ml at the moment of study termination. Changes of BP level, creatinine concentration in patients in the study were not fixed in any of treatment groups. Development of moderate hyperkaliemia amounted 21.0%, gynecomastia or pain in the region of mammary glands were fixed in 26,3% of patients in 12 months of treatment. Addition of spironolactone in a dose of 75 mg/day to optimal therapy, including ACE inhibitor and b-adrenoblocker is accompanied with improvement of clinical state and FC of patients with moderate and severe CHF. Long term therapy with spironolactone blocks processes of desadaptive LV remodeling and improves LV contractile function, what is reflected in lowering of ANP concentration in plasma of patients with CHF. Application of spironolactone in combination with ACE inhibitor and b-adrenoblocker bisoprolol does not lead to lowering of BP level and worsening of renal function, but is accompanied with development of hyperkaliemia in patients with CHF. Gynecomastia appears to be main reason limiting long term use of spironolactone in patients with CHF in a dose of 75 mg/day.",

    "222": "In a series of articles the authors analyze literature data concerning controlled studies in which cardio-, cerebro-, and vasoprotective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have been assessed. In the second communication they discuss the results of three recently completed major randomized placebo controlled trials assessing effect of ACEI on the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD) and preserved left ventricular systolic function. In PROGRESS and PEACE trials ACEI perindopril and trandolapril as monotherapy turned out incapable to prevent development of myocardial infarctions and strokes in patients with cardiovascular diseases without left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In EUROPA positive results were achieved at the account of special selection of patients, post hoc replacement of end points, and the use of high dose of perindopril (8 mg/day). Therefore results of this trial can not be applied to majority of patients with IHD. Biochemical studies have shown that ACEI are unable to suppress angiotensin II formation in human heart and vessels and thus in principle are not capable to cause cardio- and vasoprotective effects independent of their antihypertensive action. The fact is that contrary to rats in human heart and vessels angiotensin converting enzyme is responsible for just a portion (2-20% and 40%, respectively), of entire angiotensin II production. The remaining part of angiotensin II is formed under influence of chymase, activity of which is not altered during treatment with ACEI.",

This study tested the hypothesis that 17beta-estradiol enhances the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on t-PA release in young postmenopausal women. We conducted a double-blind, prospective, crossover study in 14 young postmenopausal women (mean age 48.2+/-2.3 years) who were randomized to receive 17beta-estradiol (1 mg/d) or matching placebo for 4 weeks. At the end of each treatment period, we measured the effect of intraarterial infusion of bradykinin, methacholine, and nitroprusside on forearm blood flow and net t-PA release, before and during intraarterial enalaprilat (0.33 microg/min/100 mL forearm volume). 17Beta-estradiol significantly reduced baseline venous plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen (4.4+/-1.4 versus 10.4+/-2.5 ng/mL, P=0.001) and t-PA antigen (5.5+/-0.6 versus 7.5+/-1.3 ng/mL, P=0.022) compared with placebo. 17Beta-estradiol increased basal forearm vascular release of active t-PA compared with placebo (1.2+/-0.3 IU/mL/min versus 0.4+/-0.1 IU/mL/min respectively, P=0.032), without increasing t-PA antigen release (P=0.761). Enalaprilat significantly increased basal net t-PA antigen release (from -0.8+/-1.0 to 3.2+/-1.2 ng/min/100 mL, P=0.012), but not the release of active t-PA, during either placebo or 17beta-estradiol. Enalaprilat potentiated bradykinin-stimulated vasodilation and t-PA antigen and activity release similarly during placebo and 17beta-estradiol treatment. 17Beta-estradiol treatment does not alter the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on basal t-PA antigen or on bradykinin-stimulated t-PA antigen or activity release. 17Beta-estradiol increases basal release of active t-PA in young postmenopausal women, consistent with enhanced vascular fibrinolytic function.",

One week of Ang II increased albuminuria in males, but not females, and urinary 8-iso-PGF2alpha (F2-isoP) was not increased in either males or females. MAP was salt-sensitive in both sexes receiving ACEI, but was only salt-sensitive in males with Ang II (129.3+/-3.7 versus 145.1+/-5.7; P<0.05). Albuminuria continued to increase with HS and Ang II in males, but not in females. F2-isoP excretion increased with MAP during the last week of HS and Ang II in males but was independent of MAP in females. With ACEI, MAP in females on normal salt is more responsive to Ang II but is independent of oxidative stress or renal injury. MAP in males is salt-sensitive with Ang II, which may be mediated by oxidative stress and renal injury.",

During the last years the number of percutaneous interventions became higher than bypass operations in many countries as well as in Hungary. The place of percutaneous interventions and bypass surgery in the treatment of angina pectoris is an important clinical problem. The author summarizes the data of three possible treatment options (medical therapy, percutaneous interventions and bypass surgery) of angina pectoris based on data of randomised trials. The evidences show that the first steps of therapy are - after the diagnosis - the influence of risk factors, life-style changes and optimal medical therapy. The optimal medical therapy consists of statin, aspirin and ACE inhibitor treatment besides antianginal therapy, where the beta blockers are regarded as first drugs of choice. Percutaneous interventions as initial treatment option are not recommended because we have no evidences that this intervention prolongs life and prevents myocardial infarction. If the patient remains symptomatic after medical treatment, it is necessary to perform revascularization. These procedures can improve the functional capacity more than medical treatment alone. The optimal treatment strategy of angina pectoris, based on evidence, is an important medical and economical problem.",

However, pharmacotherapy is often indicated for control of major cardiovascular risk factors, and abundant clinical trial data support the morbidity and mortality benefit of a number of categories of drug therapy following a coronary event. Although women have increasingly been enrolled in clinical trials of pharmacotherapy, under representation of women in most research studies limits the gender-specific assessment of outcomes. Equally importantly, recent randomized clinical trial data have highlighted inappropriate preventive therapies for women (i.e. those lacking effectiveness and potentially imparting harm). Decision-making data for drug therapy for women also derive from a number of clinical trials conducted solely in women. The drug classes reviewed in this article include omega-3 fatty acids, aspirin, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists or blockers, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), aldosterone antagonists, antioxidants, folic acid and vitamins B(6) and B(12), and menopausal hormone therapy and selective estrogen-receptor modulators. Information is sparse regarding specific cardiovascular pharmacotherapies for elderly women, and women of racial and ethnic minorities. Owing to the under representation of the subset of women in many trials, analysis by age, race and ethnicity is not appropriate.

    "233": "Approximately 72 million people in the US experience hypertension. Worldwide, hypertension may affect as many as 1 billion people and be responsible for approximately 7.1 million deaths per year. It is estimated that approximately 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis. Hypertensive crises are further defined as either hypertensive emergencies or urgencies, depending on the degree of blood pressure elevation and presence of end-organ damage. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage (i.e. hypertensive emergency) and requires treatment with a titratable, short-acting, intravenous antihypertensive agent, while severe hypertension without acute end-organ damage (i.e. hypertensive urgency) is usually treated with oral antihypertensive agents. The primary goal of intervention in a hypertensive crisis is to safely reduce blood pressure. The appropriate therapeutic approach of each patient will depend on their clinical presentation. Patients with hypertensive emergencies are best treated in an intensive care unit with titratable, intravenous, hypotensive agents. Rapid-acting intravenous antihypertensive agents are available, including labetalol, esmolol, fenoldopam, nicardipine and sodium nitroprusside. Newer agents, such as clevidipine and fenoldopam, may hold considerable advantages to other available agents in the management of hypertensive crises. Sodium nitroprusside is an extremely toxic drug and its use in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies should be avoided. Similarly, nifedipine, nitroglycerin and hydralazine should not to be considered first-line therapies in the management of hypertensive crises because these agents are associated with significant toxicities and/or adverse effects.", 
    "234": "Aspirin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors both have beneficial effects on prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease. For this reason, they are usually prescribed together. Some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors are thought to be due to reduced degradation of bradykinin. Bradykinin enhances nitric oxide and vasodilatory prostaglandins. Theoretically, aspirin, which inhibits cyclooxygenase enzyme, may reduce bradykinin mediated prostaglandin synthesis and blunt the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors, when used together. Although some hemodynamic studies support this hypothesis, clinical studies have conflicting results. In this article, we reviewed the possible interaction between aspirin and ACE inhibitors in light of literature findings.",

There is good rationale for initial combination therapy based on clinical trials demonstrating that achievement of BP goals within a reasonably short period of time results in fewer cardiovascular events. One approach to attaining BP goals and improving medication adherence is fixed-dose combination therapy, the use of which dates back to the 1960s. Given some of the advantages of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers in patients with heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes, many combinations include either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. In most studies, however, thiazide diuretics were necessary to achieve goal BP. Calcium channel blockers have also been used in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to lower BP. Studies are now under way to determine the relative benefits of an RAAS blocker/diuretic compared with an RAAS blocker/calcium channel blocker as initial therapy.",

In bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, Ang II (1x10(-6) M) significantly increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive multinuclear osteoclasts. Of importance, Ang II significantly induced the expression of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts, leading to the activation of osteoclasts, whereas these effects were completely blocked by an Ang II type 1 receptor blockade (olmesartan) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors. In a rat ovariectomy model of estrogen deficiency, administration of Ang II (200 ng/kg/min) accelerated the increase in TRAP activity, accompanied by a significant decrease in bone density and an increase in urinary deoxypyridinoline. In hypertensive rats, treatment with olmesartan attenuated the ovariectomy-induced decrease in bone density and increase in TRAP activity and urinary deoxypyridinoline. Furthermore, in wild-type mice ovariectomy with five-sixths nephrectomy decreased bone volume by microcomputed tomography, whereas these change was not detect in Ang II type 1a receptor-deficient mice. Overall, Ang II accelerates osteoporosis by activating osteoclasts via RANKL induction. Blockade of Ang II might become a novel therapeutic approach to prevent osteoporosis in hypertensive patients.", 
    "246": "This article is about the hierarchical quantitative structure-activity relationship technology (HiT QSAR) based on the Simplex representation of molecular structure (SiRMS) and its application for different QSAR/QSP(property)R tasks. The essence of this technology is a sequential solution (with the use of the information obtained on the previous steps) to the QSAR problem by the series of enhanced models of molecular structure description [from one dimensional (1D) to four dimensional (4D)]. It is a system of permanently improved solutions. In the SiRMS approach, every molecule is represented as a system of different simplexes (tetratomic fragments with fixed composition, structure, chirality and symmetry). The level of simplex descriptors detailing increases consecutively from the 1D to 4D representation of the molecular structure. The advantages of the approach reported here are the absence of \"molecular alignment\" problems, consideration of different physical-chemical properties of atoms (e.g. charge, lipophilicity, etc.), the high adequacy and good interpretability of obtained models and clear ways for molecular design. The efficiency of the HiT QSAR approach is demonstrated by comparing it with the most popular modern QSAR approaches on two representative examination sets. The examples of successful application of the HiT QSAR for various QSAR/QSPR investigations on the different levels (1D-4D) of the molecular structure description are also highlighted. The reliability of developed QSAR models as predictive virtual screening tools and their ability to serve as the base of directed drug design was validated by subsequent synthetic and biological experiments, among others. The HiT QSAR is realized as a complex of computer programs known as HIT QSAR: software that also includes a powerful statistical block and a number of useful utilities.",

    "248": "Sprague-Dawley rats underwent ligation of the left descending coronary artery, resulting in MI, or a sham operation. Losartan treatment and exercise training were initiated 1 week after infarction and continued for 8 weeks, either as a single intervention or combined. Collagen volume fraction in the sedentary MI (MISed) group was significantly higher than other MI groups treated with exercise training and/or losartan. Compared with MISed group, hearts of rats receiving exercise and/or losartan treatment had lower tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) 1. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 or MMP-9 did not differ among all groups. Additionally, the level of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) protein significantly decreased in response to exercise training. Furthermore, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) binding was markedly lower in hearts receiving exercise training than in the MISed hearts. Cardiac function was preserved in rats receiving exercise training, and the beneficial effect was further improved by exercise combined with losartan treatment in comparison to the MISed group.",

Data were extracted for adults newly identified with hypertension between 1995 and 2003. Drug utilization was measured as a time-dependent variable; thus, the use of combination therapies was captured for any given day for each patient in the sample. Medication adherence was assessed using medication possession ratios (MPR), calculated by the number of days of therapy dispensed to a patient divided by the number of days between subsequent prescriptions.",

Over 40% (41.6%) of these episodes involved one medication only, but patients frequently used dual (26.9%) and three or more (15.9%) therapies in combination. The frequency of prescribed antihypertensive therapies, as well as the length of, and adherence to, these therapies were described. Descriptively, medication adherence appeared to be lower among patients who received therapy for longer duration, indicating higher probability of missed doses and more frequent therapy changes.",

Understanding the type of combination therapies, the length of and adherence to these therapies, along with the observed blood pressure control rates will provide important new insights into the management of hypertensive patients.

Significant reductions in the relative risk of death from cardiovascular disease (18%), total coronary events (14%), and total renal events (21%) were observed. Thus, in patients with type 2 diabetes, a drug regimen based on a fixed-dose combination of perindopril/ indapamide affords major protection against both the macro and microvascular complications.",

Blood pressure control is the most important aspect of stroke prevention. Multiple classes of antihypertensive agents, including diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers, have reduced stroke risk.

Renal oxidant stress is a previously unrecognized factor in the progression of canine CKD and is likely to be similarly important in feline CKD. Renin-angiotensin antagonism, calcium channel antagonism, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, and antihypertensive and antiproteinuric therapy are commonly recommended for dogs and cats with CKD. These therapies would be expected to reduce renal oxidant stress by decreasing reactive oxygen species generation. Newer data indicate that dietary supplementation with specific antioxidants is an important consideration for limiting renal oxidant stress and progression of CKD.", 
    "259": "Given the long-term health consequences and increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes, there is great interest to potentially prevent or delay its onset. Primary prevention studies have demonstrated that intensive exercise and weight reduction, and to a lesser extent certain antidiabetic agents, can reduce new onset diabetes in at-risk individuals. Results from post hoc analyses and secondary end-point outcomes of large randomized controlled trials of cardiovascular drugs suggest that these may also have beneficial effects, reducing the incidence of new onset diabetes in addition to their proven cardiovascular benefits. Multiple meta-analyses confirm that drugs primarily acting on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) reduce the incidence of diabetes in the populations studied, perhaps via improved insulin sensitivity and/or effects on pancreatic beta cells. However, results from the recent Diabetes REduction Approaches with Medication study specifically failed to show a significant reduction in the incidence of diabetes with ramipril in individuals with abnormal glucose tolerance at baseline. There is only limited evidence that statins improve glucose tolerance, and although beta-blockers tend to have detrimental effects on glucose tolerance, newer agents with vasodilatory properties may confer benefits. With current guidelines, the use of cardiovascular drugs modifying the RAS will increase in at-risk individuals, but at present, they cannot be recommended to prevent diabetes.",

Additionally, a substantial gap exists between recommended guidelines and current clinical practice. Questions remain regarding which antiplatelet/antithrombotic treatment strategies are appropriate for individual patients, based on their risk. We explore the role of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors and the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin in ACS patients, and consider the difficulties involved in reducing ischemic events while limiting bleeding risks. In patients with ACS who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, high levels of microembolization and myocardial necrosis are potential risk factors for adverse long-term outcomes. Intensive antiplatelet/antithrombotic regimens may substantially affect these factors. Determination of risk levels, with the goal of targeting aggressive antithrombotic and interventional therapies to patients at higher risk, will help physicians choose appropriate pharmacologic therapy for patients with ACS.",

Despite increasing knowledge of anemia, as well as its co-association with chronic renal disease, advanced New York Heart Association class and worse prognosis, there are very few evidence-based recommendations for treatment. The use of supplemental iron, especially intravenous forms, for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in heart failure patients is associated with improved symptoms, cardiac size and function, and possibly improved outcomes. However, many patients with heart failure suffer from anemia due to other causes, including renal failure (so-called cardiorenal syndrome), erythropoietin resistance, possible ACE inhibitor use and extracellular fluid expansion. The association between anemia and adequate iron stores has led to interest in the use of erythrocyte-stimulating agents, such as erythropoietin and darbepoetin. While early data are promising, recent evidence in non-heart failure trials has led to caution in their use and given way to anticipation of results of ongoing definitive randomized trials of this therapy, such as the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) and Reduction of Events with Darbepoetin-alpha in Heart Failure (RED-HF) studies.",

Medical therapy is the mainstay of care for myocardial disorders with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockade and cardiac glycosides. There are few prospective trials of these agents in a pediatric population, but extrapolated data support their use in children.

However, the effect of Rho kinase inhibition on pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy (POH) and associated diastolic dysfunction has not been evaluated. This study examined the effect of a selective ROCK inhibitor (GSK-576371) in a POH model, induced by suprarenal abdominal aortic constriction. POH rats were divided into the following four groups: 1 (GSK 1, n = 9) or 3 (GSK 3, n = 10) mg/kg bid GSK-576371, 1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) ramipril (n = 10) or vehicle (n = 11) treatment for 4 wk. Sham animals (n = 11) underwent surgery without banding. Echocardiograms were performed before surgery and posttreatment, and hemodynamic data were obtained at completion of the study. Echocardiography showed an increase in relative wall thickness of the left ventricle (LV) following POH + vehicle treatment compared with sham animals. This was attenuated by both doses of GSK-576371 and ramipril. Vehicle treatment demonstrated abnormal diastolic parameters, including mitral valve (MV) inflow E wave deceleration time, isovolumic relaxation time, and MV annular velocity, which were dose dependently restored toward sham values by GSK-576371. LV end diastolic pressure was increased following POH + vehicle treatment compared with sham (6.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.7 mmHg, P = 0.008) and was reduced with GSK 3 and ramipril treatment (1.7 +/- 0.7, P < 0.01 and 2.9 +/- 0.6 mmHg, P < 0.01, respectively).

Here, we developed a model to study the early stage of PAH in SCD. We exposed wild-type and transgenic sickle cell SAD (Hbb(s)/Hbb(s)) mice to hypoxia (8% O(2)) for 7 days. Prolonged hypoxia in SAD mice only induced 1) increased neutrophil count in both bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral circulation; 2) increased BAL IL1beta, IL10, IL6, and TNF-alpha; and 3) up-regulation of the genes endothelin-1, cyclo-oxygenase-2, angiotensin-converting-enzyme, and IL-1beta, suggesting that amplified inflammatory response and activation of the endothelin-1 system may contribute to the early phase of PAH in SCD. Since phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are involved in pulmonary vascular tone regulation, we evaluated gene expression of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) isoforms and of PDE-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, which are the main cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate hydrolyzing enzymes. In SAD mouse lungs, prolonged hypoxia significantly increased PDE-4 and -1 gene expressions. The PDE-4 inhibitor, rolipram, prevented the hypoxia-induced PDE-4 and -1 gene up-regulation and interfered with the development of PAH, most likely through modulation of both vascular tone and inflammatory factors. This finding supports a possible therapeutic use of PDEs inhibitors in the earlier phases of PAH in SCD.",

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure representative markers of several protein oxidative pathways: direct oxidation [dinitrophenylhydrazine reactive carbonyls (DNP), glutamic (GSA), and aminoadipic (AASA) semialdehydes], mixed glyco- and lipoxidation [N(epsilon)-carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) and N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)-lysine (CML)] and lipoxidation-[N(epsilon)-(malondialdehyde)-lysine-(MDAL)], as well as renal fatty acid composition. Urinary albumin (a marker of DN), DNP, GSA, and MDAL levels, were increased in all obese rats and were dose dependently decreased by AVE7688 whereas Ramipril and Losartan were less efficient.

We determined biomarkers relevant to vascular homeostasis, such as circulating endothelial cell (CEC), and biomarkers of vascular repair, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1, tie-2, angiopoietin-2 and VEGF-R2. The present result revealed an enhanced vascular injury which was reflected by increased number of circulating endothelial cells. In addition, a defective vascular repair was also reflected by deficiencies in angiogenic factors such as VEGF, and angiopoietin-1, whereas the anti-angiogenic factors such as angiopoietin-2 and VEGF-R2 were elevated. In conclusion, the activity against vascular injuries increased under the presence of defective ability of vascular repair in CKD with moderately impaired renal function.

    "296": "Fifty years ago, investigators identified renin inhibition as the preferred pharmacologic approach to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Renin is a monospecific enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of angiotensin II. Amplified enzymatic activity and additional physiological effects occur when renin and pro-renin bind to the (pro)renin receptor. Until very recently, development of clinically effective renin inhibitors remained elusive. Molecular modeling was used to develop aliskiren, a potent, low-molecular-weight, nonpeptide, direct renin inhibitor with sufficient bioavailability to produce sustained suppression of plasma renin activity after oral administration. In patients with hypertension, aliskiren produces dose-dependent blood pressure (BP) reduction and 24-h BP control up to a dose of approximately 300 mg once daily; at these doses, aliskiren shows placebo-like tolerability. Its antihypertensive potency is approximately equivalent to that of angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. After abrupt withdrawal, persistent BP reduction and prolonged suppression of plasma renin activity is observed. When combined with diuretics, fully additive BP reduction is seen. When given with an angiotensin receptor blocker, aliskiren produces significant additional BP reduction indicative of complimentary pharmacology and more complete renin-angiotensin system blockade. Clinical trials are currently underway assessing the effects of aliskiren combined with an angiotensin receptor blocker on intermediate markers of end organ damage, and long-term end point trials are planned. The results of these studies will ultimately determine the place of renin inhibition and aliskiren in the treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular disorders. The effect of aliskiren on receptor-bound renin and pro-renin is the subject of active investigation.",

There is no specific treatment for membranous nephropathy. Supportive care with the use of diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in combination with angiotensin II receptor blocker is recommended, but these agents have only a limited effect. Immunosuppressive treatment options include the use of corticosteroids, alkylating agents, cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil, but their use is controversial, not all have been shown to be effective, and their use can be associated with significant adverse effects. This has resulted in relatively small improvement in the prognosis of membranous nephropathy in the past 30 yr, with up to 40% of patients eventually reaching end-stage renal failure. Agents that offer more complete response rates with lower adverse effects are truly needed. Recent data suggest that B cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune diseases including membranous nephropathy and that selective depletion of B cells in humans may be beneficial in preventing the production of pathogenic immunoglobulins and subsequent renal injury.", 
    "298": "The purpose of this study was to determine the baseline predictors of new-onset diabetes (NOD) in hypertensive patients and to develop a risk score to identify those at high risk of NOD.", 
    "299": "Among 19,257 hypertensive patients in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm (ASCOT-BPLA) who were randomly assigned to receive one of two antihypertensive regimens (atenolol +/- thiazide or amlodipine +/- perindopril), 14,120 were at risk of developing diabetes at baseline. Of these, 1,366 (9.7%) subsequently developed NOD during median follow-up of 5.5 years. A multivariate Cox model was developed to identify the independent predictors of NOD and individual risk scores.", 
    "300": "NOD was significantly associated with an increase in baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG), BMI, serum triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure. In contrast, amlodipine +/- perindopril in comparison with atenolol +/- thiazide treatment (hazard ratio 0.66 [95% CI 0.59-0.74]), high HDL cholesterol, alcohol use, and age >55 years were found to be significantly protective factors. FPG was the most powerful predictor with risk increasing by 5.8 times (95% CI 5.23-6.43) for each millimole per liter rise >5 mmol/l. The risk of NOD increased steadily with increasing quartile of risk score, with a 19-fold increase (95% CI 14.3-25.4) among those in the highest compared with those in the lowest quartile. The model showed excellent internal validity and discriminative ability.", 
    "301": "Baseline FPG >5 mmol/l, BMI, and use of an atenolol +/- diuretic regimen were among the major determinants of NOD in hypertensive patients. The model developed from these data allows accurate prediction of NOD among hypertensive subjects.", 
    "302": "The degradation of angiotensin (Ang) II by ACE2, leading to the formation of Ang 1-7, is an important step in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and one that is significantly altered in the diabetic kidney. This study examines the role of ACE2 in early renal changes associated with diabetes and the influence of ACE2 deficiency on ACE inhibitor-mediated renoprotection.", 
    "303": "Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin in male c57bl6 mice and ACE2 knockout (KO) mice. After 5 weeks of study, animals were randomized to receive the ACE inhibitor perindopril (2 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)). Wild-type mice were further randomized to receive the selective ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) and followed for an additional 5 weeks. Markers of renal function and injury were then assessed.", 
    "304": "Induction of diabetes in wild-type mice was associated with a reduction in renal ACE2 expression and decreased Ang 1-7. In diabetic mice receiving MLN-4760 and in ACE2 KO mice, diabetes-associated albuminuria was enhanced, associated with an increase in blood pressure. However, renal hypertrophy and fibrogenesis were reduced in diabetic mice with ACE2 deficiency, and hyperfiltration was attenuated. Diabetic wild-type mice treated with an ACE inhibitor experienced a reduction in albuminuria and blood pressure. These responses were attenuated in both diabetic ACE2 KO mice and diabetic mice receiving MLN-4760. However, other renoprotective and antifibrotic actions of ACE inhibition in diabetes were preserved in ACE2-deficient mice.", 
    "305": "The expression of ACE2 is significantly modified by diabetes, which impacts both pathogenesis of kidney disease and responsiveness to RAS blockade. These data indicate that ACE2 is a complex and site-specific modulator of diabetic kidney disease.", 
    "306": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) are frequently prescribed to renal transplant recipients with a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The aim of this study was to investigate the association of ACEI/ARB use and serum potassium levels in renal graft recipients.", 
    "307": "We conducted an open cohort study of 2041 first renal allograft recipients, transplanted at the Medical University of Vienna between 1990 and 2003. Serum potassium levels were compared over an up to 10 years of observation period between subjects with versus without ACEI/ARB therapy using a mixed effects general linear model. The analysis was adjusted for several covariables known to influence serum potassium such as the use of diuretics, beta blockers, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based immunosuppression, estimated GFR, time since renal transplantation, diabetes, years on dialysis and recipient age.", 
    "308": "The overall adjusted estimated serum potassium difference between recipients with versus without ACEI/ARB therapy was 0.08 mmol/l (P < 0.001). The use of diuretics was associated with a 0.11 mmol/l (P < 0.001) lower potassium concentration whereas each GFR decrease by 10 ml/min led to an increase of 0.04 mmol/l (P < 0.001). CNI intake increased serum potassium by 0.06 mmol/l (P = 0.002). Furthermore, serum potassium increased by 0.17 mmol/l within the first decade after transplantation (P < 0.001) while holding the other covariables constant. No effect modification between ACEI/ARB and time since transplantation was observed. Nineteen subjects (2.4%) discontinued the ACEI/ARB therapy due to hyperkalaemia.", 
    "309": "In summary, relevant hyperkalaemia associated with ACEI/ARB therapy is negligible in renal transplant recipients during long-term follow-up. The hyperkalaemic effect of ACEI/ARB is balanced by the use of diuretics.", 
    "310": "A focused review of secondary preventive medication following revascularisation provides an opportunity to ensure optimal use of these agents. A retrospective analysis of our in-house cardiothoracic surgical database was performed to identify patients undergoing non-emergency, elective surgical revascularisation discharged on four secondary preventive medications: aspirin; beta-blockers; ACE-inhibitors and statins. Of 2749 patients studied, 2302 underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mean age 65.5 years (S.D. 9.15). Overall, 2536 (92%) patients were prescribed aspirin. Beta-blockers were prescribed in 2171 (79%) patients overall, in 1096/1360 (81%) of patients with a history of myocardial infarction and in 465/619 (75%) of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Overall, 1518 (55%) patients were prescribed an ACE-inhibitor and 179 (6.5%) an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB); one of these agents was prescribed in 446/619 (72%) patients with LVSD and 915/1360 (67%) patients with a history of previous myocardial infarction. Overall, 2518 (92%) patients were prescribed a statin. Secondary preventive therapies are prescribed more commonly on discharge after CABG than in previous studies, but there is a continuing under-utilisation of ACE-inhibitors. To maximise the potential benefits of these agents, further study is required to understand why they are not prescribed.", 
    "311": "As the effect of Fontan circulation on the kidneys has not been defined, the purpose of this study was to determine whether it is associated with nephropathy.", 
    "312": "Patients with single ventricle physiology at least 2 years after Fontan procedure with normal cardiac function by echocardiography, history of normal renal ultrasound, and no co-morbidities known to affect the kidneys were evaluated. Patient's demographics, diagnoses, pre- and post-Fontan catheterization data, and current medications were collected. A current glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. Morning urine samples were collected for microalbumin/creatinine ratio (MCR).", 
    "313": "Twenty-one subjects (M:F=13:8, ages 15.2+/-8.8 years) were studied. Primary diagnoses included hypoplastic left ventricle in 9, forms of hypoplastic right ventricle in 10, and unbalanced atrio-ventricular canal in 2 patients. Time after Fontan completion was 11.4+/-6.5 years. Current medications included aspirin (14 patients), coumadin (4), enalapril (8), lisinopril (10), digoxin (11), diuretics (5), and beta-blockers (5). Four subjects had pacemakers. All patients had a normal blood pressure and eGFR. Nine patients (43%) had a pathologic MCR (>20 microg/mg). There were no significant differences between the MCR-normal and MCR-abnormal groups in age, gender, type of single ventricle, type of the procedure, age at or time since Fontan operation. The groups differed in post-Fontan pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (p<0.01) and strong positive correlations were found between the MCR and pre- and post-Fontan PVR (r=0.51, p<0.05 and r=0.61, p=0.02 respectively). The MCR-normal and MCR-abnormal groups did not differ in pacemaker, digoxin, diuretics, or anticoagulant use. However, the groups were different in using ACE inhibitors with a negative correlation (r=-0.45, p=0.04) between the MCR and lisinopril-equivalent ACE inhibitor dose. Moreover, no patient receiving a lisinopril-equivalent dose greater than 0.4 mg/kg/day had pathologic microalbuminuria. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that patients with Fontan circulation have high incidence of pathologic microalbuminuria, an indicator of renal injury. The use of ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in preserving their renal function.", 
    "314": "Various populations with hypertension have been singled out by current treatment guidelines as requiring more specific treatment. These include patients with stage 2 hypertension, black patients, and patients with coexistent diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. Hypertension in these groups is often associated with higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This article reviews current knowledge regarding hypertension in high-risk patient populations, with a particular focus on the importance of prompt, aggressive treatment to lower blood pressure and prevent cardiovascular disease progression. Such treatment includes the early use of multiple-drug therapy with agents that have complementary blood pressure-lowering mechanisms and provide protection from target organ damage. While 2- or 3-drug antihypertensive therapy in these high-risk groups has typically included a diuretic, other combinations of agents may be indicated. Evidence suggests that therapy with a calcium channel blocker and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system is one effective strategy for lowering blood pressure and improving outcomes in these populations.", 
    "315": "Hypertension is highly prevalent in older persons and most often presents as isolated systolic hypertension. Systolic blood pressure (BP) is a stronger predictor of risk than diastolic BP in persons older than 50 years. Most of these patients will require multiple drug therapies to achieve the substantial reductions in systolic BP needed to reach target levels. Clinical trials have demonstrated that antihypertensive therapy with beta-blockers and diuretics as well as with calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers reduces cardiovascular risk in older patients. Studies examining safety and BP-lowering efficacy have shown that a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker plus a calcium channel blocker as well as a combination of diuretics and beta-blockers or diuretics plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker achieves greater BP reductions than monotherapy. Such multiple drug regimens are well tolerated in older patients.", 
    "316": "Fixed-dosed combination regimens consisting of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker represent a new addition to the available antihypertensive treatment options. Clinical trials demonstrate that both the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine and angiotensin II receptor blockers are effective agents for the management of hypertension in individuals with or without cardiovascular disease. When combined, these 2 classes of agents have complementary effects on blood pressure, as each targets separate signaling pathways in the vasculature pivotal to the regulation of vascular function. In clinical trials this combination has demonstrated better efficacy, defined by time to reach blood pressure targets as well as levels of blood pressure achieved, compared with the individual agents. In a comparative trial, a combination of amlodipine plus valsartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker) also produced greater reductions in blood pressure compared with a combination of lisinopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of amlodipine and an angiotensin II receptor blocker is well tolerated, including in patients with stage 2 hypertension and the elderly.", 
    "317": "The recognition of a continuous relationship between elevated blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular risk has influenced national and international guidelines for the classification, prevention, and management of hypertension. The most recent report (2003) of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure uses BP thresholds to define categories of normal, prehypertension, and hypertension. A new definition proposed by the Hypertension Writing Group in 2005 offers an approach to diagnosis and management based on global or total risk. Thus, even in the absence of sustained elevations in BP, patients may have a moderate to high risk of vascular events due to the presence of additional cardiovascular risk factors, disease markers, and target organ damage. The 2007 European guidelines continue to classify hypertension based on cutoffs while also placing emphasis on multivariate formulations for cardiovascular risk assessment and goals of therapy. All 3 sets of guidelines acknowledge the necessity of using > or =2 antihypertensive agents to attain BP goals in many patients.", 
    "318": "The purpose of this review is to describe how recent pharmacological and genetic studies have contributed to our understanding of the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in age-related sarcopenia and diastolic dysfunction. Treatment strategies are limited in the context of both of these conditions, although interventions, which include blockade of the RAS (using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers) are successful and lead to improvements in functional outcomes that are not necessarily mediated by hemodynamic effects of the drugs. Studies in animal models of sarcopenia and diastolic dysfunction point to ubiquitous effects of RAS blockade on multiple biological mechanisms, including inflammation, oxidative damage and metabolic dysregulation. Therefore, a re-evaluation of the use of these drugs in other conditions should be considered for maintaining functional independence in older individuals.", 
    "319": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and diuretics (used as antihypertensive agents) on global and domain-specific cognitive decline were evaluated in 326 non-demented community-dwelling participants over the age of 70 years in the Women's Health and Aging Study II. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used for evaluating the association between parameters. The use of ACE-I for more than 3 years was associated with reduced incidence of impairment on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Trail Making Test-Part A and Part B (TMT, Parts A and B), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Immediate Recall (HVLT-I), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Delayed Recall (HVLT-D). The use of diuretics for more than 3 years was associated with reduced incidence of impairment on MMSE, TMT, Parts A and B, HVLT-I, and (HVLT-D). The presence of vascular disease did not make any difference to these effects. Therefore, the use of ACE-Is or diuretics was associated with reduced incidence of impairment of both global and domain-specific cognition in elderly women, and may help delay progression to dementia.", 
    "320": "Both essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus affect the same major target organs. The common denominator of hypertensive/diabetic target organ-disease is the vascular tree. Left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary artery disease are much more common in diabetic hypertensive patients than in patients suffering from hypertension or diabetes alone. The combined presence of hypertension and diabetes concomitantly accelerates the decrease in renal function, the development of diabetic retinopathy and the development of cerebral diseases. Lowering blood pressure to less than 130/80 mm Hg is the primary goal in the management of the hypertensive diabetic patients. Beta-blockers have been reported to adversely affect the overall risk factor profile in the diabetic patient. In contrast, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been reported to be either neutral or beneficial with regard to the overall metabolic risk factor profile. Combination therapy is usually required to achieve blood pressure goal in diabetic patients. The addition of aldosterone antagonists may be beneficial in patients with resistant hypertension and low levels of serum potassium. Aggressive control of blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels should be attempted to reduce the cardiovascular risk of diabetic hypertensive patients.", 
    "321": "While tobacco smoking is the main risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) only a fraction of smokers go on to develop the disease. We investigated the relationship between the insertion (I)--deletion (D) polymorphisms in the Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene and the risk of developing COPD in smokers by determining the distribution of the ACE genotypes (DD, ID and II) in 151 life-long male smokers. 74 of the smokers had developed COPD (62 +/- 2 years; FEV1 44 +/- 6% reference) whereas the rest retained normal lung function (56 +/- 2 yrs; FEV1 95 +/- 3% reference). In addition, we genotyped 159 males recruited randomly from the general population. The prevalence of the DD genotype was highest (p = 0.01) in the smokers that developed COPD and its presence was associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk for COPD (OR 2.2; IC95% 1.1 to 5.5). Surprisingly, the 151 individuals in the smoking population did not demonstrate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium unlike the 159 recruited from the general population. Our results suggest that ACE polymorphisms are associated with both the smoking history of an individual and their risk of developing COPD.", 
    "322": "Diabetes is currently one of the leading causes of end-stage renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy in the Western World. About 15% to 20% of type 1 diabetic patients and 30% to 40% of type 2 diabetic patients will eventually develop end-stage renal failure. To prevent the development or progression of diabetic kidney disease, good glycaemic control remains the cornerstone in the management of diabetic patients. Beyond glycaemic control, other metabolic factors have been shown to be involved in the development of diabetic kidney disease, i.e. advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) and the aldose reductase pathway. Furthermore, an adequate control of high blood pressure and treatment of microalbuminuria are major therapeutic targes. To achieve adequate blood pressure control, a combination therapy with different classes of antihypertensive agents is often necessary, especially including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Other vasoactive factors involved in diabetic nephropathy such as endothelin and nitric oxide will be covered briefly. Besides hyperglycaemia and high blood pressure, other risk factors have been identified in the development or progression of diabetic kidney disease: smoking, hyperlipidaemia, obesity and high protein intake. Their impact on renal function will be highlighted. Finally, recent research has also identified intracellular pathways such as the diacylglycerol-protein kinase C pathway and several growth factors, such as growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor, and platelet derived growth factor as players in diabetic kidney disease.", 
    "323": "To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatments for hypertension.", 
    "324": "The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) found that first-line treatment with lisinopril or amlodipine was not significantly superior to chlorthalidone in terms of the primary endpoint, so differences in costs may be critical for optimizing decision-making.", 
    "325": "Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using bootstrap resampling to evaluate uncertainty.", 
    "326": "Over a patient's lifetime, chlorthalidone was always least expensive (mean $4,802 less than amlodipine, $3,700 less than lisinopril). Amlodipine provided more life-years (LYs) than chlorthalidone in 84% of bootstrap samples (mean 37 days) at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $48,400 per LY gained. Lisinopril provided fewer LYs than chlorthalidone in 55% of bootstrap samples (mean 7-day loss) despite a higher cost. At a threshold of $50,000 per LY gained, amlodipine was preferred in 50%, chlorthalidone in 40%, and lisinopril in 10% of bootstrap samples, but these findings were highly sensitive to the cost of amlodipine and the cost-effectiveness threshold chosen. Incorporating quality of life did not appreciably alter the results. Overall, no reasonable combination of assumptions led to 1 treatment being preferred in over 90% of bootstrap samples.", 
    "327": "Initial treatment with chlorthalidone is less expensive than lisinopril or amlodipine, but amlodipine provided a nonsignificantly greater survival benefit and may be a cost-effective alternative. A randomized trial with power to exclude \"clinically important\" differences in survival will often have inadequate power to determine the most cost-effective treatment.", 
    "328": "Essential hypertension is treated primarily with a view to reducing blood pressure, and not with regard to normalizing the main pathological changes: the peripheral resistance and the cardiovascular structure. The aim of this review is to discuss whether normalization of the latter parameters, in particular resistance vessel structure, may also be a target for therapy. The review presents first the evidence for altered structure of the resistance vasculature, an increase in the media:lumen ratio of the vessels due to inward eutrophic remodelling. Secondly the degree to which it may be possible to rectify the abnormal structure is discussed, where it is shown that there is strong evidence that this requires a therapy which causes vasodilatation in the patient concerned. Thirdly evidence is presented that altered small artery structure appears to have prognostic consequences. Fourthly, the cellular mechanisms which may be involved are discussed, where there is evidence that vasoconstriction in itself can cause inward remodelling, and that this can be prevented by vasodilators. Finally, the consequences of these findings are considered as regards clues for strategies that may be able to improve the outcome of antihypertensive therapy. The review concludes that there is reasonably strong evidence that a treatment which reduces peripheral resistance in the individual patient will, apart from reducing blood pressure, also improve the abnormal structure.", 
    "329": "Many different drugs and agents may cause nephrotoxic acute kidney injury (AKI) in children. Predisposing factors such as age, pharmacogenetics, underlying disease, the dosage of the toxin, and concomitant medication determine and influence the severity of nephrotoxic insult. In childhood AKI, incidence, prevalence, and etiology are not well defined. Pediatric retrospective studies have reported incidences of AKI in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) of between 8% and 30%. It is widely recognized that neonates have higher rates of AKI, especially following cardiac surgery, severe asphyxia, or premature birth. The only two prospective studies in children found incidence rates of 4.5% and 2.5% of AKI in children admitted to PICU, respectively. Nephrotoxic drugs account for about 16% of all AKIs most commonly associated with AKI in older children and adolescents. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, amphotericin B, antiviral agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors, radiocontrast media, and cytostatics are the most important drugs to indicate AKI as significant risk factor in children. Direct pathophysiological mechanisms of nephrotoxicity include constriction of intrarenal vessels, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, and-more infrequently-tubular obstruction. Furthermore, AKI may also be caused indirectly by rhabdomyolysis. Frequent therapeutic measures consist of avoiding dehydration and concomitant nephrotoxic medication, especially in children with preexisting impaired renal function.", 
    "330": "While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was initially thought to enter cells through direct fusion with the plasma membrane, more recent evidence suggests that virus entry may also involve endocytosis. We have found that SARS-CoV enters cells via pH- and receptor-dependent endocytosis. Treatment of cells with either SARS-CoV spike protein or spike-bearing pseudoviruses resulted in the translocation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV, from the cell surface to endosomes. In addition, the spike-bearing pseudoviruses and early endosome antigen 1 were found to colocalize in endosomes. Further analyses using specific endocytic pathway inhibitors and dominant-negative Eps15 as well as caveolin-1 colocalization study suggested that virus entry was mediated by a clathrin- and caveolae-independent mechanism. Moreover, cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane, which have been shown to act as platforms for many physiological signaling pathways, were shown to be involved in virus entry. Endocytic entry of SARS-CoV may expand the cellular range of SARS-CoV infection, and our findings here contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, providing new information for anti-viral drug research.", 
    "331": "Angiotensin II and aldosterone both promote endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. We investigated the effect of a combination of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone antagonist, and enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on NO bioavailability and spontaneous atherosclerotic changes. Twenty-four myocardial infarction-prone Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits were treated with vehicle (control), eplerenone (50 mg/kg per day), enalapril (3 mg/kg per day), or eplerenone plus enalapril for 8 weeks (n=6 in each group). After treatment, acetylcholine-induced NO production was measured as a surrogate for endothelium-protective function, and vascular peroxynitrite (a product of superoxide and NO) was measured to assess dysfunctional endothelial NO synthase activity. Plaque area was quantified by histology. Intra-aortic infusion of acetylcholine produced an increase in plasma NO concentration that was significantly higher with all of the drug treatments compared with the control. Eplerenone and enalapril, in combination, increased acetylcholine-induced NO by 7.9 nM, which was significantly higher than with either eplerenone or enalapril alone. Vascular peroxynitrite was significantly higher in the control group (1.3 pmol/mg of protein) and significantly lower with combination treatment (0.4 pmol/mg of protein) compared with the enalapril or eplerenone group. The highest tetrahydrobiopterin levels were observed after cotreatment with eplerenone and enalapril. Histology of the thoracic aorta showed a significantly decreased plaque area with combination therapy compared with monotherapy. Combined treatment with a selective aldosterone antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor has additive protective effects on endothelial function and on atherosclerotic changes via decreased nitrosative stress.", 
    "332": "Antihypertensive drugs with favorable metabolic effects are advocated for first-line therapy in hypertensive patients with metabolic/cardiometabolic syndrome (MetS). We compared outcomes by race in hypertensive individuals with and without MetS treated with a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine besylate), an alpha-blocker (doxazosin mesylate), or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril).", 
    "333": "A subgroup analysis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind hypertension treatment trial of 42 418 participants. We defined MetS as hypertension plus at least 2 of the following: fasting serum glucose level of at least 100 mg/dL, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of at least 30, fasting triglyceride levels of at least 150 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of less than 40 mg/dL in men or less than 50 mg/dL in women.", 
    "334": "Significantly higher rates of heart failure were consistent across all treatment comparisons in those with MetS. Relative risks (RRs) were 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.90), 1.49 (1.17-1.90), and 1.88 (1.42-2.47) in black participants and 1.25 (1.06-1.47), 1.20 (1.01-1.41), and 1.82 (1.51-2.19) in nonblack participants for amlodipine, lisinopril, and doxazosin comparisons with chlorthalidone, respectively. Higher rates for combined cardiovascular disease were observed with lisinopril-chlorthalidone (RRs, 1.24 [1.09-1.40] and 1.10 [1.02-1.19], respectively) and doxazosin-chlorthalidone comparisons (RRs, 1.37 [1.19-1.58] and 1.18 [1.08-1.30], respectively) in black and nonblack participants with MetS. Higher rates of stroke were seen in black participants only (RR, 1.37 [1.07-1.76] for the lisinopril-chlorthalidone comparison, and RR, 1.49 [1.09-2.03] for the doxazosin-chlorthalidone comparison). Black patients with MetS also had higher rates of end-stage renal disease (RR, 1.70 [1.13-2.55]) with lisinopril compared with chlorthalidone.", 
    "335": "The ALLHAT findings fail to support the preference for calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors compared with thiazide-type diuretics in patients with the MetS, despite their more favorable metabolic profiles. This was particularly true for black participants.", 
    "336": "Diabetes mellitus and heart failure are common comorbidities, and their prevalence has increased significantly over the past decade. We examined the relationships between diabetes and heart failure, the effect of commonly prescribed antidiabetic drugs on the development of heart failure, and the benefits and risks of recommended heart failure therapies in patients with diabetes. Compared with patients with heart failure who do not have diabetes, patients with both diabetes and heart failure have a poorer prognosis, including a 1.5-2-fold higher risk of mortality. Based on the results of randomized controlled trials, insulin and sulfonylureas do not appear to protect against or contribute to the development of new-onset heart failure, whereas metformin may modestly reduce the risk. The use of metformin in patients with established heart failure is controversial; retrospective analyses have shown that metformin may have a beneficial effect on outcomes, but there are no prospective, randomized clinical trials to support its use in this population. The thiazolidinediones, however, contribute to the development of heart failure and increase the risk of heart failure exacerbations particularly when used in combination with insulin. Recommendations for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure in patients with diabetes have been largely derived from post hoc analyses or preplanned subgroup analyses in landmark clinical trials. The data clearly support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers for both the prevention and treatment of symptomatic heart failure in patients with diabetes. Despite concerns regarding the potential risks of beta-blockers in patients with diabetes, these drugs have a clear mortality benefit in patients with stages B and C heart failure. Therefore, patients with diabetes should not be denied beta-blocker therapy unless there is a clear contraindication. Likewise, aldosterone receptor antagonists should be added to standard therapies in patients with stages C and D heart failure. Future heart failure studies should include a sufficiently large diabetes cohort to conduct meaningful preplanned subgroup analyses that examine the effect of proposed treatments on both heart failure-related and diabetes-related outcomes.", 
    "337": "Smoking should be stopped and hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism treated in elderly patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower extremities. Statins reduce the incidence of intermittent claudication and improve exercise duration until the onset of intermittent claudication in patients with PAD and hypercholesterolemia. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel, especially clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins should be given to all elderly patients with PAD without contraindications to these drugs. Beta blockers should be given if coronary artery disease is present. Exercise rehabilitation programs and cilostazol increase exercise time until intermittent claudication develops. Chelation therapy should be avoided. Indications for lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or bypass surgery are (1) incapacitating claudication in patients interfering with work or lifestyle; (2) limb salvage in patients with limb-threatening ischemia as manifested by rest pain, nonhealing ulcers, and/or infection or gangrene; and (3) vasculogenic impotence.", 
    "338": "The leading cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with coronary heart disease is plaque rupture. Between 6% and 12% of AMI patients have angiographically normal coronary arteries. However, new procedures have demonstrated the limits of coronarography and challenged the existence of this situation. Angiograms may fail to detect minimal lesions whereas, in many cases, intravascular sonography reveals small atherosclerotic plaques. With the development of intravascular sonography and multislice computed tomography, the prevalence of myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries has fallen to about 1%. Myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries may be due to coronary vasospasm, hypercoagulable states, intense sympathetic stimulation, non atherosclerotic coronary disease, alcohol or cocaine abuse, and systemic diseases. In a series of 1205 AMI patients, we found no significant coronary disease in 45 patients, but intravascular sonography showed minimal intracoronary plaque in 21 of these cases. The 24 patients without significant lesions were young, had no risk factors for AMI without a prodrome, low peak creatine release, a small reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction after thrombolysis or angioplasty, and good outcome at 26 months. The mechanisms of AMI in these 24 patients were coronary spasm, myocardial bridge, a prothrombotic state, contraceptive pill usage, and drug or alcohol abuse. The diferential diagnoses of these cases of AMI are acute myocarditis and stress cardiomyopathy, and apical left ventricular ballooning. Initial management is the same as for \"conventional\" AMI, including pain relief nitrates, antiplatelet agents, heparin, thrombolysis or angioplasty in the acute phase, and ACE inhibitors. Patients with spasm should receive calcium antagonists rather than beta-blockers. The prognosis of these patients is better than that of patients with atherosclerotic lesions. They nonetheless need close follow-up and strict secondary prevention measures, including smoking cessation and prevention of dyslipidemia and diabetes.",

We have performed a retrospective cohort study to clarify whether the long-term outcome has improved in Japanese children with IgA-N. Renal survival was defined as the time from onset to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We divided the study period into two time periods based on the occurrence of the initial renal biopsy:1976-1989 and 1990-2004. Actuarial survivals were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons were made with the logrank test. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis. Between 1976 and 2004, 500 children were diagnosed as having IgA-N in our hospitals. The actuarial renal survival from the time of apparent disease onset was 96.4% at 10 years, 84.5% at 15 years and 73.9% at 20 years. Renal survival in the 1990-2004 period was significantly better than that in 1976-1989 (p=0.008), and a marked improvement in renal survival in patients with severe IgA-N was also observed (p=0.0003). Multivariate analysis indicated that diagnosis year was a significant factor for ESRD-free survival independently of baseline characteristics. The results of this study show that there has been an improvement in terms of renal survival in Japanese children with IgA-N.",

His laboratory investigation was significant for a persistently low serum complement 3 level. A renal biopsy was performed, based on which, he was diagnosed with dense deposit disease/membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (DDD/MPGN II). He was treated with alternate-day oral corticosteroids, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and tacrolimus. Factor H mutational analysis showed the Y402H and I62V allele polymorphisms. The purpose of our report is to discuss the association of the H402 allele variant of factor H with the DDD/MPGN II phenotype and its possible therapeutic implications.",

In obese Zucker rats at 32 weeks of age superoxide levels were elevated in the aortas and epineurial arterioles, which were reduced by treatment with either drug. Nitrotyrosine levels were increased in epineurial arterioles and reduced with enalapril treatment. EBF was decreased and corrected by treatment with either drug. Motor nerve conduction velocity was decreased and significantly improved with enalapril treatment.

    "345": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has emerged as an important hormonal system in the initiation and pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Therefore, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are emerging as novel drugs for the prevention of AF. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized, controlled, parallel-design clinical trials evaluating effect of ACEIs or ARBs on the development of AF was performed. Treatment with ACEIs or ARBs reduced the relative risk (RR) of AF in patients with hypertension by 23% [RR 0.769, P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.686-0.862] and by 11% in patients after myocardial infarction (RR 0.898, P < 0.05, 95% CI 0.814-0.992). Reduction in AF was greatest in patients after electrical cardioversion (RR 0.491, P < 0.001, 95% CI 0.334-0.720) and in patients with heart failure (RR 0.684, P < 0.001, 95% CI 0.594-0.787).

    "346": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is thought to act in an opposing manner to its homologue, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), by inactivating the vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin II and generating the vasodilatory fragment, angiotensin(1-7). Both ACE and ACE2 are membrane-bound ectoenzymes and may circulate in plasma as a consequence of a proteolytic shedding event. In this study, we show that ACE2 circulates in human plasma, but its activity is suppressed by the presence of an endogenous inhibitor. Partial purification of this inhibitor indicated that the inhibitor is small, hydrophilic and cationic, but not a divalent metal cation. These observations led us to develop a method for removal of the inhibitor, thus allowing detection of plasma ACE2 levels using a sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based assay. Using this technique, ACE2 activity measured in plasma from healthy volunteers (n = 18) ranged from 1.31 to 8.69 pmol substrate cleaved min-1 ml-1 (mean +/- s.e.m., 4.44 +/- 0.56 pmol min-1 ml-1). Future studies of patients with cardiovascular, renal and liver disease will determine whether plasma ACE2 is elevated in parallel with increased tissue levels observed in these conditions.", 
    "347": "Patients with kidney failure are at high risk of a cardiac death and frequently develop left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The mechanisms involved in the cardiac structural changes that occur in kidney failure are yet to be fully delineated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a newly described enzyme that is expressed in the heart and plays an important role in cardiac function. This study assessed whether ACE2 plays a role in the cardiac remodelling that occurs in experimental acute kidney injury (AKI). Sprague-Dawley rats had sham (control) or subtotal nephrectomy surgery (STNx). Control rats received vehicle (n = 10), and STNx rats received the ACE inhibitor (ACEi) ramipril, 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1) (n = 15) or vehicle (n = 13) orally for 10 days after surgery. Rats with AKI had polyuria (P < 0.001), proteinuria (P < 0.001) and hypertension (P < 0.001). Cardiac structural changes were present and characterized by LVH (P < 0.001), fibrosis (P < 0.001) and increased cardiac brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) mRNA (P < 0.01). These changes occurred in association with a significant increase in cardiac ACE2 gene expression (P < 0.01) and ACE2 activity (P < 0.05). Ramipril decreased blood pressure (P < 0.001), LVH (P < 0.001), fibrosis (P < 0.01) and BNP mRNA (P < 0.01). These changes occurred in association with inhibition of cardiac ACE (P < 0.05) and a reduction in cardiac ACE2 activity (P < 0.01). These data suggest that AKI, even at 10 days, promotes cardiac injury that is characterized by hypertrophy, fibrosis and increased cardiac ACE2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, by promoting the production of the antifibrotic peptide angiotensin(1-7), may have a cardioprotective role in AKI, particularly since amelioration of adverse cardiac effects with ACE inhibition was associated with normalization of cardiac ACE2 activity.",

    "353": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerular disease in children and adolescents, accounting for 20% of the glomerular diseases diagnosed by renal biopsy and 30% to 40% of biopsies performed because of hematuria and/or proteinuria in children. It is likely that several cases are missed because IgAN is mostly asymptomatic and is not detectable in the majority of children who do not undergo screening programs. The natural history of IgAN in children represents, with few exceptions, the early phase of the entire course. The disease had been considered more benign than in adults, however, this was found not to be true in long-term follow-up evaluations, and the 20-year survival rates were similar in the 2 age groups. The interest on IgAN in children has increased after the consideration that most subjects with IgAN entering dialysis are young adults and, because the decline of renal function in these patients is slow (25% need dialysis in 20 years), the realization that their disease had begun in childhood. Hence, detecting IgAN at the beginning of its natural history may offer the possibility of early treatment of the nephritis and/or its complications, with benefits for patients at the pediatric age, but even more benefits later in life.", 
    "354": "Antihypertensive peptides received much interest over the last decade. These peptides are known to be angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in vitro, but the actual antihypertensive mechanisms in vivo are still unclear. In this research, we used rat aortic rings in organ bath experiments to investigate five potential vascular antihypertensive mechanisms of the dipeptide Val-Tyr. Only one significant effect was observed, namely preincubation of the aorta with Val-Tyr led to a significant shift of the concentration-response curve evoked by angiotensin I (Ang I). Val-Tyr had no effect on the angiotensin II receptor or the alpha-adrenergic receptor. Furthermore, it did not interact with voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, or with nitric oxide production/availability. In conclusion, our results show that Val-Tyr specifically inhibits Ang I-evoked contraction through ACE inhibition and that four other main mechanisms of vascular tone regulation are not affected.", 
    "355": "Internally quenched fluorogenic substrates are commonly used for measuring enzyme activity in biological samples and allow high sensitivity and continuous real-time measurement that is well suited for high throughput analysis. We describe the development and optimisation of an immunocapture-based assay that uses the fluorogenic peptide substrate (Mca-RPPGFSAFK(Dnp)) and allows the specific measurement of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) activity in brain tissue homogenates. This fluorogenic substrate can be cleaved by a number of enzymes including neprilysin (NEP), endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), as well as IDE, and we have previously shown that discrimination between these individual enzymes is not readily achieved in tissue homogenates, even in the presence of selective inhibitors and pH conditions. We tested a panel of IDE antibodies to isolate and capture IDE from brain tissue homogenates and found that immunocapture with antibody to the inactive domain of IDE prior to the addition of fluorogenic substrate allows sensitive (linear at 156-2500ng/ml) and specific measurement of IDE activity and negligible cross-reactivity with NEP, ACE or ECE-1. This assay should allow the measurement of IDE enzyme levels in a variety of biological tissues and may be useful in study of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and insulin-dependent diabetes.", 
    "356": "As part of the recommended modern post-myocardial infarction (MI) management, including reperfusion strategies, antiplatelet therapy, and beta-blockers, we may wonder whether the impact of early inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is as important as it was 20 years ago. This review demonstrates that significant clinical benefit can be derived from angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) even when added to other currently recommended treatment strategies in post-MI patients. Moreover, the effects of RAS inhibition extend far beyond the early post-MI neurohormonal activation and left ventricular remodeling phases. The favorable effects of RAS inhibition on important prognostic markers such as atrial fibrillation, renal function, and diabetes have recently been unraveled. Post-MI RAS inhibition also benefits all age groups, including elderly patients.", 
    "357": "Myocarditis has been shown to be a common cause of cardiomyopathy; it is believed to account for 25% of all cases of heart failure in humans. Unfortunately, the disease is difficult to detect clinically before a myopathic process ensues. Treatment of myocarditis-induced heart failure includes the standard regimen of diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and beta-adrenergic blockers. Treatment of myocarditis itself is dependent on the etiology of the illness. Additional treatments under investigation for viral and autoimmune myocarditis include immunosuppressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, immunoglobulins, immunomodulators, and antivirals, with no specific therapy having a real advantage over standard treatment for heart failure. Despite advances in treatment, more work needs to be done in the early detection of myocarditis. In addition, better means need to be established for distinguishing between viral and noninfectious autoimmune forms of the disease so that appropriate treatment can be instituted.",

    "364": "Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are unavoidable byproducts of various metabolic pathways. They are formed by reactive metabolic intermediates such as methylglyoxal (MG), glyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone. These reactive intermediates bind to proteins, DNA, and other molecules and disrupt their structures and functions, which leads to different diseases such as vascular complications of diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and aging. In recent years, more compounds that prevent the formation of AGEs or degrade the existing AGEs have been produced and patented. They include: 1) aminoguanidine, 2) drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes such as metformin and pioglitazone (patented), 3) angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 4) pentoxyfylline (patented), 5) metal ion chelators desferoxamine and penicillamine, 6) antioxidants such as vitamin C or E, 7) amino group capping agents such as aspirin, 8) enzymes that cause deglycation of Amadori products, the Amadoriases, 9) compounds that mostly break alpha-dicarbonyl cross-links such as phenacylthiazolium bromide and its stable derivative ALT-711 (Alagebrium), and 10) derivatives of aryl ureido and aryl carboxaminido phenoxy isobutyric acids (patented). While some of these anti-AGE compounds are being used in clinical practice (such as metformin, pioglitazone, pentoxyfylline and aspirin) or tested in clinical trials (such as aminoguanidine and ALT-711), most of them are commonly used as experimental tools to investigate the role of AGEs in different disease conditions.", 
    "365": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide and is a more common cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than myocardial infarction among patients with hypertension. Identifying and modifying key risk factors is crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality from stroke. Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke, and antihypertensive treatment is of paramount importance to reduce the incidence of stroke mortality and morbidity. Perindopril is a third-generation long acting, once-daily lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with high tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme affinity, lowering angiotensin II and potentiating bradykinin. Its efficacy, safety and tolerability are well established in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence from clinical trials as well as from recent patents that has been gathered in regard to perindopril, demonstrating not only its efficacy in reducing blood pressure, but also to other cardiovascular protective properties that act in addition to the obvious blood-pressure-lowering effect in the prevention of stroke in patients with essential hypertension, with particular attention paid to the results from the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS).", 
    "366": "The renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure, acting via the effects of the hormone angiotensin (Ang) II. Ang II increases blood pressure and can exert growth-promoting effects leading to end-organ damage. Excess RAAS activity has been shown to be a major underlying cause of hypertension, heart failure, and related cardiovascular disorders. Inhibitors of renin block the RAAS at its first and rate-limiting step and thus appear to offer an excellent opportunity for blood pressure control. In the past two decades various potential renin inhibitors have been developed but have not been clinically useful. This review discusses a recent patent in the development of a novel class of non-peptide renin inhibitors: an alkanecarboxamide, aliskiren (SPP-100; Novartis). Aliskiren is effective in animal models, while recent results from studies in humans indicate that aliskiren is the first in a new class of orally effective renin inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "367": "Oxidative stress is a common denominator in many aspects of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Some drugs, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and a free radical scavenger, edaravone, are prescribed with oxidative stress as their main target. Furthermore, of the drugs in current clinical use, such as anti-hypertension reagents including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and anti-hyperlipidemic reagents like statins, protect various organs, e.g., vessel, brain, heart, and kidney, via anti-oxidative stress effects in addition to their original pharmacological properties. While results of clinical trials of anti-oxidative stress reagents in patients with cardiovascular disease are contradictory to date, this may be explained by a variety of reasons such as an inadequate study design. More competent anti-oxidative reagents are awaited, and superoxide dismutase mimetics, thiols, xanthine oxidase and NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors, which regulate intracellular redox reaction and subsequently inhibit oxidative stress, are among promising candidates of future drug developments currently receiving much interest. In this review, the current advances will be highlighted in development of novel anti-oxidative therapeutic approaches against cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "368": "Angiotensin II (AngII) is the major regulator of blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and some endocrine functions related to cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, it has been shown that AngII plays a role in various pathological situations involving tissue remodelling and in cancer. Two distinct subtypes of AngII receptors [type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2)] have been identified, and both belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. A knowledge of the 3D structure of AT receptors could be of great help in the task of understanding molecular interactions, and in the rational design of specific ligands; however, as GPCRs are membrane-bound proteins, high-resolution structural characterization is still an extremely difficult task. For this reason, great importance has been placed on molecular modelling studies and in particular, on homology modelling (HM) techniques. In this review, we report and analyze the main experimental data and the computational procedures and validation methods used for the construction of the AT receptors, describing in details the most successful results and new trends.", 
    "369": "Diabetic neuropathy is a debilitating disorder that occurs in more than 50 percent of patients with diabetes. Evidence suggests that there are at least five major pathways involved in the development of diabetic neuropathy: metabolic, vascular, immunologic, neurohormonal growth factor deficiency, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In light of the complicated etiologies, an effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy has not yet been identified. Hyperglycemia increases tissue angiotensin II, which induces oxidative stress, endothelial damage and other pathologies including vasoconstriction, thrombosis, inflammation and vascular remodeling. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and/or blocking of the angiotensin II receptor are recognized as first line treatment for nephropathy and cardiovascular disease in diabetes patients. A new class of drug in late stages of development is vasopeptidase inhibitors. This drug inhibits both angiotensin converting enzyme activity and neutral endopeptidase. Neutral endopeptidase is a protease that degrades a number of biologically active peptides including vasoactive peptides. However, little information is available about the potential benefits of these drugs on diabetic neuropathy. Pre-clinical studies suggest that these drugs may be useful in treating diabetic complications involving vascular tissue. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the use of angiotensin converting enzyme and vasopeptidase inhibitors in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.", 
    "370": "Type 2 diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions throughout the world, which has major health implications as such patients have considerably increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is involved in a wide range of adverse effects that contribute to the pathogenesis of CHD in diabetic patients, including vascular haemodynamic regulation, oxidative stress and hypertrophy of vascular cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used in clinical practice. In diabetic patients ACE inhibitors and ARBs both effectively lower blood pressure, particularly in combination with low-dose thiazide diuretics, and may be considered first line therapies in the treatment of diabetic hypertension. Additionally they have important renoprotective actions independent of their blood pressure-lowering action, which is of particular benefit in diabetic patients, who are at increased risk of developing nephropathy. ARBs are generally well tolerated, but ACE inhibitor therapy is associated with some side effects such as cough and both may result in hyperkalaemia. Blockade of the RAAS with these agents appears to play an important role not only in protecting from renal disease, but it may also help to reduce morbidity and mortality from certain vascular diseases in diabetic patients.", 
    "371": "The prevalence of diabetes and its complications is increasing worldwide. Among the microvascular complications, diabetic nephropathy is the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. Although angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have been cited as the first line of therapy for the management of microalbuminuria, the rate of remission from microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria has been lower than the expected. Furthermore, due to the elevated frequency of side effects of the rennin-angiotensin blockers new approaches for the treatment of microalbuminuria are needed. Pentoxifylline, a xanthine derivate drug with hemorheologic properties and primarily indicated for the therapy of disturbances of blood fluidity, is also an antagonist of adenosine 2 receptors and have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, properties that promote beneficial changes in the blood flow conditions and kidney function. Current evidence shows that the short-term use of pentoxifylline has low side-effects, reduces both proteinuria and microalbuminuria in subjects with diabetes, and is as effective as captopril in the reduction of microalbuminuria in non-hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. Although this data suggests that pentoxifylline could be useful for preventing the development of end-stage renal disease is necessary to conduct long-term studies to evaluate the role of pentoxifylline in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and the prevention of chronic renal failure. In this article, we review the clinical evidence that show the efficacy of pentoxifylline in the management of microalbuminuria in diabetic patients.", 
    "372": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD). Although the pathogenesis of DN is multifactorial, local inflammatory stress may result from both the metabolic and hemodynamic derangements observed in DN. Inflammatory markers such as Interleukin-18 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha are increased in the serum of patients with diabetes and DN. This occurs at a very early stage of disease, and correlates with the degree of albuminuria. Recent data suggest that standard pharmacologic interventions for DN, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists, may have anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of their hemodynamic effect. Although inflammation is traditionally thought of as a process resulting in macrophage infiltration, current scientific progress has lead to the novel idea that even cells distant from the blood stream, such as podocytes, can produce cytokines and can express molecules that are part of the co-stimulatory pathway. A strong translational research effort is currently aimed at defining the role of such molecules in cells other than lymphocytes and macrophages. Experimental animal models have recently provided evidence that some acute phase markers of inflammation such as intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), TNF-alpha and Monocytes Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) may have a causative role in the development of DN. Here, we review the current evidence supporting the role of inflammation in the early phases of clinical and experimental DN. A complete understanding of inflammatory pathways activated in DN may lead to the discovery of earlier and more reliable markers of DN than albuminuria and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

Moreover, many experimental approaches reveal that exogenous EPC injection stimulates blood flow recovery in critical limb and myocardial ischemia, providing a new therapeutic tool for CVD. Diabetes Mellitus is a clinical condition characterized by a high incidence of CVD and is indeed associated with alterations in EPC physiology. In this review we focus on the relationships between EPCs and vascular biology, with particular regard to Diabetes Mellitus and future therapeutical implications.",

In such patients a positive correlation was found between IL-6 and 24-h systolic and diastolic BP (r = 0.88; p < 0.05 and r = 0.97; p < 0.01, respectively).", 
    "378": "A positive correlation between CRP, IL-6 and BP may evidence for involvement of nonspecific inflammation in the course of EH. Patients with elevated CRP responded to ariphon retard with positive CRP dynamics. This can be explained by a relief of chronic hemodynamic stress. A positive CRP dynamics in response to prestarium can be mediated by block of angiotensin II.", 
    "379": "The paper presents a comparison of the influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with high (perindopril) or low (enalapril) affinity to the endothelial renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on the dynamics of the content of humoral endothelial dysfunction markers in patients with essential hypertension (EH) complicated by ischemic cerebral stroke. The subjects of the study were patients with EH complicated by acute cerebral ischemia, who received hospital treatment with perindopril (52 patients) or enalapril (58 patients). Changes in the physical properties of the cytoplasmatic membrane and phosphatidylserine exterialization were studied in peripheral blood on lymphocyte model. In peripheral blood plasma, the dynamics of sPECAM-1 titre and antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) were studied. All the patients had high contents of blebbing and Annexin-positive lymphocytes, as well as high sPECAM-1 and APLA titres on the 1st day of hospital treatment. These variables decreased by the 20th day of hospital stay. In patients receiving perindopril the contents of endothelial dysfunction markers under study decreased more prominantly vs. patients in the other group. The elevation of endothelial dysfunction markers is a result of its progression and oxidative stress effect. Endothelial dysfunction can be corrected, which is proved by the decrease in the level of its markers by the 20th day of hospital treatment. The most prominent therapeutic effect of perindopril is a result of its high affinity to endothelial ACE and the inhibition of bradykinin degradation.", 
    "380": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the promotion of cardiovascular disease and target-organ damage, mediated in part by hypertension. Combination therapy targeting RAS activation may reduce target-organ damage and provide superior blood pressure (BP) control; combining angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) represents one possible approach. In monotherapy studies, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have demonstrated similar positive effects on BP and on RAS-related target-organ damage, including nephropathy and congestive heart failure. Studies of combination therapy, most of which involved addition of an ARB to existing ACE inhibitor therapy, have demonstrated benefits among patients with congestive heart failure and renal disease. However, variances in study design and populations, dosing and titration methods, and clinical end points, in addition to inherent differences between agents, limit the ability to reach clinically meaningful conclusions about the value of dual RAS inhibition. Trials designed to document such efficacy are currently underway.",

The identification of underlying causes of FSGS (secondary FSGS) has increased our insight into the pathogenesis of FSGS. Moreover, differentiating between primary (idiopathic) and secondary forms of FSGS is important to allow appropriate treatment. Recently a new pathological classification of FSGS was proposed, expanding FSGS to include nonsclerotic lesions. In this review we discuss the current diagnostic and therapeutic options in patients with FSGS.", 
    "386": "Diabetic nephropathy is one of the main causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Current renoprotective treatment for diabetic nephropathy includes strict glycemic and optimal blood pressure control, proteinuria/albuminuria reduction and the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blocking agents. However, the renoprotection provided by these treatments is only partial, and many patients still have progressive disease, thus suggesting that a more effective approach is urgently needed. This review examines emerging strategies for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, including aggressive RAAS blockade, statins, pentoxifylline, glitazones, ruboxistaurin, as well as sulodexide. Pilot studies that used surrogate end points, mainly albuminuria, will be discussed. New insights suggest that treating microalbuminuric diabetic patients with statins, pentoxifylline, glitazones and sulodexide could be a new approach for reducing the incidence of clinical proteinuria. In diabetic patients with overt nephropathy, the administration of statins, pentoxifylline, sulodexide or aggressive RAAS inhibition, including RAAS dual blockade (i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors plus angiotensin receptor blockers or aldosterone antagonists plus ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers), seems to be a promising way to preserve renal function and to prevent progression to ESRD. Results of ongoing, long-term trials on major renal and cardiovascular clinical outcomes, as well as on mortality are needed to establish whether the current standard of care of diabetic nephropathy might be improved with these new strategies.", 
    "387": "ANG II is a critical mediator of diabetic nephropathy. Pharmacologic inhibition of ANG II slows disease progression beyond what could be predicted by the blood pressure lowering effects alone, suggesting the importance of nonhemodynamic pathways of ANG II in mediating disease. Podocyte injury and loss are cardinal features of diabetic nephropathy. Mounting evidence suggests that the podocyte is a direct target of ANG II-mediated signaling in diabetic renal disease. We have tested the hypothesis that high glucose leads to the activation of a local angiotensin system in podocytes and delineated the underlying pathways involved. Cultured podocytes were exposed to standard glucose (5 mM), high glucose (40 mM), or mannitol as an osmotic control. ANG II levels in cell lysates were measured in the presence or absence of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (captopril), chymase (chymostatin), and renin (aliskiren) activity. The effects of glucose on renin and angiotensin subtype 1 receptor expression and protein levels were determined. Exposure to high glucose resulted in a 2.1-fold increase ANG II levels mediated through increased renin activity, as exposure to high glucose increased renin levels and preincubation with Aliskiren abrogated glucose-induced ANG II production. Relevance to the in vivo setting was demonstrated by showing glomerular upregulation of the prorenin receptor in a podocyte distribution early in the course of experimental diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, high glucose increased angiotensin subtype 1 receptor levels by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Taken together, the resultant activation of a local renin angiotensin system by high glucose may promote progressive podocyte injury and loss in diabetic nephropathy.",

Despite several decades of research, new aspects of the mechanism of action of ACE have been elucidated, expanding our understanding of its role not only in cardiovascular regulation but also in different areas. Recent findings have ascribed an important role for ACE/kinin B(2) receptor heterodimerization in the pharmacological properties of the receptor. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that this interaction also affects ACE enzymatic activity. ACE catalytic activity was analyzed in Chinese hamster ovary cell monolayers coexpressing the somatic form of the enzyme and the receptor coding region using as substrate the fluorescence resonance energy transfer peptide Abz-FRK(Dnp)P-OH. Results show that the coexpression of the kinin B(2) receptor leads to an augmentation in ACE activity. In addition, this effect could be blocked by the B(2) receptor antagonist icatibant. The hypothesis was also tested in endothelial cells, a more physiological system, where both proteins are naturally expressed. Endothelial cells from genetically ablated kinin B(2) receptor mice showed a decreased ACE activity when compared with wild-type mice cells. In summary, this is the first report showing that the ACE/kinin B(2) receptor interaction modulates ACE activity. Taking into account the interplay among ACE, ACE inhibitors, and kinin receptors, we believe that these results will shed new light into the arena of the controversial search for the mechanism controlling these interactions.",

However, the mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was not significant change among 3 groups. After SAD, maximal contraction of pulmonary artery rings to phenylephrine was markedly decreased; the most prominent morphological change in the lung included thickening vascular walls, increasing number of smooth muscle cells, and greater wall-to-lumen ratio; the tissue concentrations of cGMP was reduced significantly; PDE1A or PDE1C expression was upregulated significantly, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was downregulated significantly.

For this end, the records of 112 CRF patients with serum creatinine (SCr) level of 150- 850 micromol/L were retrospectively studied at King Khaled University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The leading causes of CRF in the study patients were diabetes in 52 (46.4%) patients, glomerulonephritis in 25 (22.4%) and hypertension in 17 (15.2%). Progressive elevation of SCr level was recorded at 92 micromol/L/year in 62 (55.4%) patients with initial SCr level of 150-300 micromol/L; they progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in a mean duration of 4 (1/2) years. Forty-three (38.4%) patients with SCr level of 300-450 micromol/L had an increase of SCr at 136 micromol/L/year and progressed to ESRD in a mean period of four years. Seven (6.2%) patients who had initial SCr level of > 450 micromol/L had an increase of 136 micromol/L/year and progressed to ESRD in a mean duration of 2 (1/2) years. Sixty-two (55.4%) patients had initial blood pressure (BP) readings above the recommended level of 130/80 mm Hg. Antihypertensive management stabilized 47 (75.8%) of these patients using multiple drug regimens such as an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and diuretics (20.5%). Though this center did not use erythropoietin (EPO) in these patients, the control of the levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit was obtained by aggressive iron supplementation including intravenous administration. In conclusion, the present management of CRF patients, which attempts to comply with the international standards, still needs refining in order to reach better outcome.", 
    "436": "Renal clearances of suitable clearance markers such as inulin and p-aminohippurate, determined before and after protein load, have been used for a long time to determine glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood-flow, renal functional reserve as well as renal vascular resistance. Despite this long history, inconsistent results were achieved in determining renal functional reserve after protein ingestion or aminoacids infusion. Most authors found acute 'blunted increases' in GFR after dietary stresses, whereas others found acute decreases. In hypertensive patients showing hyperfiltration, a contradictory situation was observed; the traditionally observed 'blunted increase' in GFR and increase in the intraglomerular pressure were neither accompanied by a change in albumin excretion nor by an expected dynamic GFR response after administration of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors. We are of the opinion that the traditional clinical methods for assessing acutely provoked changes in renal function have been inappropriate and that an approach based on the two-compartment model of pharmacokinetics is more adequate for studying dynamic clearance changes within clinically feasible time horizons. Such test evaluations performed in patients within a washout period, and after long-term treatment with various drugs enable one to assess the efficacy of the therapeutic regimens especially in patients showing apparently normal or increased baseline clearances in hyper filtering kidneys.",

Other components of a therapeutic cocktail could be; (a) thromboxane antogonist, (b) leukotriene antagonist, (c) platelet activating factor antagonist, (d) an anti-oxidant and (e) an anti-fibrotic agent like pentoxyfylline.

These drugs may also exert beneficial metabolic effects, causing improved glucose tolerance in patients. Gender-related differences have also been observed in the clinical responsiveness to these drugs, but the mechanism behind this is unclear. In the present study, we have investigated whether these drugs and the fatty acid palmitate influence the pancreatic microcirculation, thereby having an impact on insulin secretion and glycaemia in vivo, in spontaneously diabetic male and female Goto-Kakizaki rats. In male rats, pancreatic IBF (islet blood flow) and total PBF (pancreatic blood flow) were increased significantly by pravastatin, captopril and irbesartan. Serum insulin levels were increased by pravastatin and captopril. Palmitate suppressed pancreatic IBF and increased blood glucose. In female animals, pancreatic IBF was stimulated by captopril, candesartan and irbesartan. Total PBF was increased by captopril, candesartan and irbesartan, and by pravastatin. Palmitate suppressed pancreatic IBF and serum insulin secretion. In conclusion, the present study lends support to the view that a local pancreatic RAS (renin-angiotensin system) and pravastatin may be selectively influencing the pancreatic microcirculation and therefore affecting insulin secretion and glycaemia. NEFAs (non-esterified fatty acids) impaired pancreatic IBF, suppressed insulin secretion and increased blood glucose.

Persistence on treatment was higher in patients treated with ARBs (68.5%) and ACE inhibitors (64.5%) vs CCBs (51.6%; p < 0.05), beta-blockers (44.8%, p < 0.05), and diuretics (34.4%, p < 0.01). No ARB, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, or diuretic was associated with a higher persistence in therapy compared with the other molecules used in each therapeutic class. The rate of persistence was significantly higher in patients treated with lercanidipine vs others CCBs (59.3% vs 46.6%, p < 0.05). Systolic and diastolic BP was decreased more successfully in patients treated with ARBs (-11.2/-5.8 mmHg), ACE inhibitors (-10.5/-5.1 mmHg), and CCBs (-8.5/-4.6 mmHg) compared with beta-blockers (-4.0/-2.3 mmHg p < 0.05) and diuretics (-2.3/-2.1 mmHg, p < 0.05). No ARB, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, or diuretic was associated with a higher BP control compared with the other molecules used in each therapeutic class. A trend toward a better BP control was observed in response to lercanidipine vs other CCBs (p = 0.059). The present results confirm the importance of persistence on treatment for the management of hypertension in clinical practice.", 
    "492": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is significant in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and specifically coronary atherosclerosis. There is strong evidence that the RAS has effects on the mechanisms of action of atherosclerosis, including fibrinolytic balance, endothelial function, and plaque stability. Pharmacological inhibition of the renin angiotensin system includes angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and renin inhibitors. These agents have clinical benefits in reducing morbidity and mortality in the management of hypertension. In addition, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have shown to be effective in the management of congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. This review article discusses the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involving the RAS in coronary atherosclerosis as well as the effects of RAS inhibition in clinical studies involving coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "493": "The renin angiotensin system (RAAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular (CV) disease. Modulation of RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and aldosterone inhibitors reduces a range of adverse CV outcomes in patients with or at risk of CV disease. Currently, there is incomplete evidence to show all RAAS modulators provide vascular protection by reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and CV death. In patients at high risk for CV events, studies with ACEi designed to test for long-term vascular protection, showed benefit. In contrast, studies of ARBs in patients with hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease have not consistently shown a reduction of CV outcomes. However, none of these studies was specifically designed to examine the impact of ARBs on the vascular protective outcomes of CV death, non-fatal MI, and stroke. The ONTARGET and TRANSCEND studies are designed to determine whether the ARB telmisartan is similar (or non-inferior) or superior to the ACEi ramipril in the reduction of CV events in patients with established CV disease or diabetes with target organ damage. The ONTARGET study has enrolled 25,620, and TRANSCEND 5,776 subjects. The subjects in both trials are similar to those studied in the HOPE study, yet there is greater ethnic diversity, a higher proportion of patients with cerebro-vascular disease, and a greater use of beta blockers and lipid-lowering treatment. The studies completed recruitment in 2004, and are due to complete follow-up and report the results in 2008. The ONTARGET and TRANSCEND studies will provide valuable comparative data on the efficacy of telmisartan and ramipril and their combination in patients at high risk for CV events. Although it is possible that enhanced benefits will be observed with dual therapy, the outcomes with ARB monotherapy remain uncertain.", 
    "494": "Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, even in the presence of intensive glycemic control. Substantial clinical and experimental evidence suggest that both diabetes and insulin resistance cause a combination of endothelial dysfunctions, which may diminish the anti-atherogenic role of the vascular endothelium. Both insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction appear to precede the development of overt hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in patients with diabetes or insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction may be a critical early target for preventing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Microalbuminuria is now considered to be an atherosclerotic risk factor and predicts future cardiovascular disease risk in diabetic patients, in elderly patients, as well as in the general population. It has been implicated as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature cardiovascular mortality for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as for patients with essential hypertension. A complete biochemical understanding of the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia causes vascular functional and structural changes associated with the diabetic milieu still eludes us. In recent years, the numerous biochemical and metabolic pathways postulated to have a causal role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease have been distilled into several unifying hypotheses. The role of chronic hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic microvascular complications and in neuropathy has been clearly established. However, the biochemical or cellular links between elevated blood glucose levels, and the vascular lesions remain incompletely understood. A number of trials have demonstrated that statins therapy as well as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is associated with improvements in endothelial function in diabetes. Although antioxidants provide short-term improvement of endothelial function in humans, all studies of the effectiveness of preventive antioxidant therapy have been disappointing. Control of hyperglycemia thus remains the best way to improve endothelial function and to prevent atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular complications of diabetes. In the present review we provide the up to date details on this subject.", 
    "495": "The importance of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in diseases such as hypertension, congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure has long ago been recognized. It has also been established that inhibition of RAAS, using inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), is an effective way to intervene with the pathogenesis of these disorders. Renin inhibitors block the RAAS at the highest level, at its origin, and might thus offer a new exciting approach for pharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension. Aliskiren is the first in a new class of orally active, non-peptide, low molecular weight renin inhibitors, and so far the only renin inhibitor that has progressed to phase III clinical trials. This review summarizes the available data on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of aliskiren and its clinical development for treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "496": "It is thought that coronary artery spasm is involved in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in a large proportion of Japanese patients. However, large-scale trial data in Japanese patients were lacking. The JMIC-B (Japan Multicenter Investigation for Cardiovascular Diseases-B) study conducted for Japanese hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, compared the incidence of cardiac events (cardiac death or sudden death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for angina pectoris or heart failure, serious arrhythmia, and coronary interventions) in patients receiving twice-daily nifedipine or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril, lisinopril or imidapril). There was a similar incidence of cardiac events in both treatment groups but exacerbation of angina pectoris in patients with a history of myocardial infarction was lower with nifedipine. Nifedipine appeared to be better than ACE inhibitor in inhibiting the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the development of coronary artery stenosis as evidenced by quantitative coronary angiogram (QCA) analysis.", 
    "497": "The usefulness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been established in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. However, Ca2+ channel antagonists have not been rigorously evaluated in this population. The randomised J-MIND (Japan Multicenter Investigation of Antihypertensive Treatment for Nephropathy in Diabetics) study conducted in Japanese hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, compared the effects of twice-daily nifedipine and ACE inhibitors on the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The investigators found that nifedipine had a renoprotective effect similar to ACE inhibitors and there was no difference in the rate of progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria between treatment groups. Similarly, there was no difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events between the treatment groups. These data indicate that long-acting nifedipine can be used for renoprotective effect in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "498": "It is hard to achieve antihypertensive goal in daily clinical practice. Combination therapy is mostly applied since antihypertensive therapy with single agent has limitations. Ca channel blocker (CCB), angiotension II receptor blocker (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor are current mainstream antihypertensives and combination therapy of CCB and ARB is especially applied. CCB shows good antihypertensive effect and has fewer side-effects. On the other hand, ARB inhibits renin-angiotensin system and excels at cardioprotective and renoprotective effect. These combination therapies are vital to achieve antihypertensive goal. In the years ahead, it is necessary to review whether or not there are differences on the effect and medical cost economy even between antihypertensive agents in the same class.",

Women who delivered an infant from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2005 were identified. Cardiovascular drug use was evaluated assuming a gestational duration of 270 days.", 
    "501": "During the period 2001 through 2005, 118,935 deliveries were identified that met the criteria for study; 3.1% of women (N = 3672) were dispensed an antihypertensive medication and 0.12% of women (N = 146) were dispensed an antihyperlipidemic medication at any time during pregnancy. The most common antihypertensive drugs dispensed during pregnancy were nifedipine (1219 deliveries; 1.0%), methyldopa (961 deliveries; 0.8%), atenolol (593 deliveries; 0.5%), and labetalol (576 deliveries; 0.5%). Overall, 134 women (0.11%) received an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and 7 women (0.006%) received an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) during pregnancy. Statins were the most commonly dispensed antihyperlipidemic drugs (71 deliveries; 0.06%).", 
    "502": "The prevalence of use of cardiovascular drugs that are suspected to be fetotoxic or teratogenic (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and statins) was low in this cohort of pregnant women. Differing patterns of use across health plans suggests that further research is needed to evaluate the potential differential effects of cardiovascular drugs to assist prescribers and patients in making informed treatment decisions.", 
    "503": "Recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs like diuretics increase plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels. However, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma Hcy levels has not been tested extensively. The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (AHT) on Hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. A case-control study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 103 normotensive controls was undertaken. Plasma Hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of AHT. The genotyping of MTHFR C677T polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decreased and hydrochlorothiazides significantly increased the plasma Hcy levels in hypertensive patients (P<0.05). No significant association between MTHFR C677T genotypes and changes in Hcy levels in response to antihypertensive was observed in EH patients. The decrease in Hcy induced by beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors observed in our study may be due to the improvement of endothelial function along with improved renal function. Thus, our results suggest that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional beneficial therapeutic effects to the EH patients by decreasing Hcy levels.", 
    "504": "Irrespective of aetiology, the nephrotic syndrome presents a range of potentially serious complications. These include thrombo-embolism, infection and hyperlipidaemia. Despite the prevalence of the nephrotic state among renal patients, there has been little prospective analysis of the therapeutic approach to these potentially life-threatening events even though their pathogenesis has been examined in some detail. Most of these complications are more prevalent once the albumin concentration falls below 20 g/L and it is recognized that restoration of serum albumin significantly diminishes their frequency. However, this may be difficult to achieve, especially in adults. The problems of thrombo-embolism and infection are of immediate concern but, in persistent cases, the additional issues of hyperlipidaemia and loss of bone density also require consideration for therapy. Thus, in addition to specific attempts to reduce proteinuria, it is recommended that high-risk nephrotic patients receive anticoagulation, pneumococcal vaccination and lipid lowering therapy. Strategies for the preservation of bone density should also be considered, particularly in patients who receive high-dose corticosteroids. Among a range of non-specific treatments for proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear best in terms of efficacy and safety. Prospective trials are required to clarify the longitudinal impact of these generic strategies on the protection of the persistently nephrotic patient.", 
    "505": "Previous studies have indicated the importance of angiotensin II (ANG II) in skeletal muscle angiogenesis. The present study explored the effect of regulation of the renin gene on angiogenesis induced by electrical stimulation with the use of physiological, pharmacological, and genetic manipulations of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Transfer of the entire chromosome 13, containing the physiologically regulated renin gene, from the normotensive inbred Brown Norway (BN) rat into the background of an inbred substrain of the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Mcwi) rat restored renin levels and the angiogenic response after electrical stimulation. This restored response was significantly attenuated when SS-13(BN)/Mcwi consomic rats were treated with lisinopril or high-salt diet. The role of ANG II on this effect was confirmed by the complete restoration of skeletal muscle angiogenesis in SS/Mcwi rats infused with subpressor doses of ANG II. Congenic strains derived from the SS-13(BN)/Mcwi consomic were used to further verify the role of the renin gene in this response. Microvessel density was markedly increased after stimulation in congenic strains that contained the renin gene from the BN rat (congenic lines A and D). This angiogenic response was suppressed in control strains that carried regions of the BN genome just above (congenic line C) or just below (congenic line B) the renin gene. The present study emphasizes the importance of maintaining normal renin regulation as well as ANG II levels during the angiogenesis process with a combination of physiological, genetic, and pharmacological manipulation of the RAS.",

Nonparticipants were more likely to be female and have undergone 1- or 2-vessel CABG procedures compared with 3- or 4-vessel procedures. Subjects were primarily English-speaking, white, and male. Adherent behavior was reported in 73 of 132 patients (55%). The average period between CABG and the survey was 16 months. Nonadherent patients were in stronger agreement on the General Overuse (p = 0.01) and General Harm (p = 0.04) scales. The adjusted odds of adherent behavior were significantly lower, with an increasing General Overuse score (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95; p = 0.007); an annual income of $50,000 to $100,000 relative to less than $20,000 (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.91; p = 0.031), and a living status of \"alone\" compared with \"with adults and no children\" (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.65; p = 0.007).

    "511": "Despite proven renoprotection from RAAS blockade and its increased application since the early 1990s, we have experienced an increasing CKD/ESRD epidemic, especially among U.S. diabetics. Consequently, some concerns regarding iatrogenic azotemia from RAAS blockade have surfaced. We hypothesized that susceptible CKD patients with normal renal arteries on conventional angiography, including MRA, but who have microvascular arteriolar narrowing in the renal circulation - mimicking large vessel renal artery stenosis, even without precipitating risk factors - could experience worsening azotemia after periods of time exceeding three months on stable doses of RAAS blockade. Between September 2002 and February 2005, as part of a larger prospective study of renal failure in CKD patients on RAAS blockade, we studied five patients with >25% higher serum creatinine and normal MRA without precipitating factors. RAAS blockade was discontinued. eGFR by MDRD was monitored. Five Caucasians (M:F = 1:4; age 68 years) were enrolled and followed-up at 29.6 months. The duration of RAAS blockade at enrollment was 34.6 months. The baseline eGFR had decreased from 28.4 +/- 7.1 to 17.0 +/- 7.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2) BSA (p < 0.001) at enrollment. One required temporary hemodialysis; no deaths occurred. eGFR increased from 17.0 +/- 7.4 to 24.6 +/- 9.5 ml/min/1.73 m(2) BSA (p = 0.009), 29.6 (20-43) months after stopping the RAAS blockade. We conclude that worsening azotemia occurs in susceptible CKD patients on stable doses of RAAS blockade after long periods of time, despite normal renal arteries without precipitating risk factors. We submit that microvascular renal arteriolar narrowing is the pathophysiologic mechanism. These observations call for further study.", 
    "512": "Contrast induced nephropathy, a leading cause of new-onset renal failure in U.S. hospitals, may be accelerated by concurrent RAAS blockade in CKD patients. Current literature is inconclusive. Between September 2002 and February 2005, we prospectively enrolled all CKD patients on RAAS blockade who developed contrast-induced nephropathy. RAAS blockade was discontinued, standard nephrology care applied, and eGFR by MDRD was monitored. Seven patients (M:F, 3:4; age, 72.3 years) were enrolled. Mean duration of RAAS blockade at enrollment was 25.8 months. Baseline vs. enrollment eGFR was 45.5 +/- 17 vs. 16.6 +/- 6.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.009. Three of the seven patients (43%) required dialysis, one temporarily. Two older patients (mean age, 81.5 vs. 68.6 years, p = 0.017) progressed to ESRD. eGFR in five non-ESRD patients increased from 18.5 +/- 7.1 to 41.0 +/- 27.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2) after 29.4 months. Baseline eGFR was lower in the two patients who developed ESRD (29.5 vs. 51.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Two patients exhibited very steep serum creatinine trajectories, indicative of rapid loss of eGFR. New onset proteinuria was observed. We have demonstrated very bad renal outcomes with three of seven (43%) patients requiring dialysis, with two (29%) progressing to ESRD. In two patients, loss of eGFR was clearly accelerated. These findings support the view that concurrent RAAS blockade, particularly in older CKD patients, exacerbates contrast-induced nephropathy. Also, lower baseline eGFR predicted worse renal outcomes. We support the recommendation to withhold RAAS blockade, 48 hours before contrast exposure, to improve renal outcomes.",

The scanning electron microscopy of granules showed differences in morphology, and X-ray powder diffraction technique presented some modification in crystalline structure of captopril in granules coated with PVP and ethyl/methylcellulose. The dissolution profile of granules coated with ethylcellulose showed a median time release of 4 hr whereas for granules coated with ethyl/methylcellulose, this time was 3.5 hr.

    "518": "The beneficial effect achieved by the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in chronic cardiovascular diseases is already an evidence belonging to the basic treatment of the disease. Given the fact that the vascular system is uniform and consubstantial both physiologically, pathophysiologically and in terms of therapy, and that it plays a key role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)--a disease leading to tragic loss of vision with its etiology and therapy being unknown--endothelial dysfunction should be treated. The pleiotropic effects of ACE-inhibitors, AR-blockers and statins help to restitute the balance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in endothelial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress, the balance of growth factors and their inhibitors, pro- and anti-inflammatory substances and prothrombotic and fibrinolytic factors, inhibit the formation of oxidative stress and its harmful effects; while aspirin with its pleiotropic effects acting as an antiaggregation substance on platelets helps to set the endothelial layer back to its normal balance regarding its vasodilating, antithrombotic, antiadhesive and anti-inflammatory functions; trimetazidine as an adjuvant agent helps to normalize, to restore the disturbed metabolism of the retinal tissue functioning insufficiently, in the end. For the above reasons it is suggested that, as a part of long term primary and/or secondary prevention, the following groups of patients with AMD receive--taking into consideration all possible side effects--ACE-inhibitor and/or AR blocker and statin and aspirin treatment, and trimetazidine as adjuvant medicine 1. those without maculopathy but being above the age of 50 and having risk factors inducing endothelial dysfunction; 2. those, who already developed AMD in one eye as a prevention in the second, unaffected eye; and 3. those patients who developed AMD in both eyes in order to ameliorate or merely slow the progression of the disease. Besides, it is advisory to eliminate AMD risk factors inducing oxidative stress with consecutive endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "519": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and is both common and amenable to treatment. Several major new studies have appeared recently and in response the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the British Hypertension Society have collaborated to update their respective guidelines on primary hypertension, and to agree joint recommendations. The update focuses only on pharmacological aspects of treatment. Wherever possible, the recommendations are based on the clinical outcomes of mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and new onset diabetes mellitus, rather than on blood pressure lowering. A brief treatment algorithm is included. In summary, either calcium channel inhibitors or thiazide-type diuretics should be the preferred initial agent for use in primary hypertension in most patients, although angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (including angiotensin-II receptor inhibitors if ACE-intolerant) are preferred in patients younger than 55.", 
    "520": "Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) represents the most common discharge diagnosis in patients over age 65, and has an exceptionally high mortality and read-mission risk. ADHF is characterized by abnormal hemodynamics, including increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and peripheral vasoconstriction, although cardiac index may be reduced, normal, or increased. Myocardial injury, which may be related to decreased coronary perfusion, activation of neurohormones, and/or renal dysfunction, may contribute to short-term and postdischarge cardiovascular events. Recent ADHF registries have provided valuable insights into the characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of these patients. Most patients with ADHF present with either normal systolic blood pressure or elevated blood pressures; hypotension is relatively uncommon. These patients have significant cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities that may contribute to the pathogenesis and/or adverse outcomes in ADHF. Therapies for ADHF have been targeted to improve symptoms and hemodynamics, as well as preserve or improve renal function, prevent myocardial damage, modulate neurohumoral and inflammatory activation, and manage other comorbidities that may cause and/or contribute to the progression of this syndrome. Concomitant therapies proven to provide long-term benefits in chronic heart failure are also essential. There remains an unmet need for therapeutic approaches for the early management of ADHF that may improve short- and long-term outcomes. Ongoing clinical trials are intended to provide data that will better define the benefits and risks of therapies for ADHF.", 
    "521": "Recent trials of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) have provided a wealth of data regarding diagnosis, risk factors, and treatment. Aggressive risk factor management has been shown to improve patient survival, reduce recurrent events and the need for interventional procedures, and improve the quality of life in patients with known CVD. There have been impressive reductions in blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and improved diabetes control. Medical therapy with options such as angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aspirin has been shown to have positive effects. Patients in current trials are more likely to be receiving appropriate treatment upon study entry than were patients in older trials. Changes in the risk profile of high-risk patients have reduced the overall rates of cardiovascular events and will continue to affect outcomes in randomized clinical trials. Such changes should be considered in the design of new clinical trials and in the interpretation of current data.",

We describe a case of reninoma and provide a review of the literature, with a discussion emphasizing the diagnostic evaluation for such patients. The subject had persistent elevation of both plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone. Imaging studies revealed the presence of a lesion in the renal cortex, which was further identified as a renin-producing lesion via selective venous catheterization following administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I). Following partial nephrectomy, the PRA and plasma aldosterone levels declined rapidly and the blood pressure and potassium supplementation requirements normalized. This case demonstrates the utility of both appropriate imaging studies and selective venous catheterization following provocative administration of an ACE-I for diagnosis.",

Mesenteric resistance arteries were studied on a pressurized myograph, whereas cardiac effects were assessed by histology and immunohistochemistry. BP of SHRSP was lowered by combined valsartan/NEPI and ACEI/NEPI slightly more than valsartan, whereas NEPI was ineffective. Valsartan, valsartan/NEPI and ACEI/NEPI normalized resistance artery relaxation responses to acetylcholine, and significantly decreased media/lumen ratio and collagen deposition. All treatments decreased vascular NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated superoxide production. Valsartan/NEPI and ACEI/NEPI decreased media/lumen ratio of intramyocardial coronary arteries, while valsartan alone had no effect. Valsartan/NEPI and ACEI/NEPI increased vascular matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity, and decreased tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-2 activity and macrophage infiltration.",

    "535": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is thought to counterbalance ACE by breakdown of angiotensin (Ang) II and formation of Ang(1-7). Both enzymes are highly expressed in the kidney, but reports on their regulation differ. To enhance our understanding of the regulation of renal ACE and ACE2, we investigated renal ACE and ACE2 expression during conditions of physiological (low-sodium diet) and pharmacological changes (ACE inhibition) in activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Healthy rats were treated with vehicle or lisinopril with either a control or a low-sodium diet, and renal ACE2, ACE and plasma angiotensins were studied. During vehicle treatment, low sodium reduced renal ACE mRNA and activity without affecting ACE2 mRNA or activity and plasma Ang(1-7) and Ang II balance. Lisinopril significantly reduced renal ACE activity without affecting renal ACE2 activity. During ACE inhibition, low sodium reduced both ACE and ACE2 mRNA without affecting ACE2 activity or further reducing ACE activity. Measurements of renal neprilysin activity revealed no significant differences between any of the treatment groups. Plasma Ang(1-7) and Ang II balance is positively shifted towards the beneficial vasopeptide Ang(1-7) by the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, especially during a low sodium intake. In conclusion, modulation of the RAAS, by low sodium intake or ACE inhibition, does not affect renal ACE2 despite major variations in renal ACE. Thus, ACE and ACE2 are differentially regulated by low sodium and ACE inhibition. Therefore, we propose that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors are predominantly mediated by modulation of ACE and not ACE2. Whether this also applies to renal disease conditions should be investigated in future studies.",

Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an exogenous NO donor, prevented significantly the effects of imidaprilat on MMP-2 inhibition. Imidaprilat alone didn't affect MMP-2 activity and expression.

Body fat content and distribution were assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and Magnetic Resonance Imaging at 12 weeks. Animals administered with perindopril had a body fat proportion that was half that of controls. This was consistent with, but disproportionately greater than the observed differences in food intake and body weight. Perindopril treatment completely removed hypertension.

The demonstration of the pro-fibrogenesis role of angiotensin II in chronic liver diseases brought up the idea that anti-angiotensin II agents may be effective on improvement of hepatic fibrosis by either blocking the angiotensin II receptor or inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). This study is aimed at comparing the anti-fibrogenesis effects of two ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, in the livers of rats with bile duct ligation through biochemical and histopathological parameters. Male Albino Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n=4-5 each), including sham operated, bile duct ligated, captopril and enalapril treated. After 28 days of treatment, the liver was removed and the levels of hepatic hydroxyproline, glutathione and lipid peroxidation were determined. The degree of the development of fibrosis was evaluated through histopathological numerical scores. The results demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors increased GSH, decreased lipid peroxidation and improved hepatic fibrosis as shown by histopathology as well as decreased hepatic content of hydroxyproline. Enalapril was significantly more effective than captopril (p<0.001) in improvement of hepatic fibrosis. Also it was shown that enalapril has a significant antioxidative effect (p<0.05) in comparison with captopril.

There may be a role in the progression of heart failure, as the deleterious effects of even \"mild\" renal impairment seem to be borne out in predicting outcome, in a broad range of heart failure patients including those with heart failure and preserved systolic function.

For the above purpose, the response of mesenteric arterioles of anesthetized neonatal streptozotocin-induced (n-STZ) diabetic and control rats was evaluated using intravital microscopy. In n-STZ diabetic rats, enalapril treatment restored the reduced response to BK but not the potentiation of BK by Ang-(1-7) present in non-diabetic rats. The restorative effect of enalapril was observed at a dose that did not correct the altered parameters induced by diabetes such as hyperglycemia, glicosuria, insulin resistance but did reduce the high blood pressure levels of n-SZT diabetic rats. There was no difference in mRNA and protein expressions of B1 and B2 kinin receptor subtypes between n-STZ diabetic and control rats. Enalapril treatment increased the B2 kinin receptor expression. From our data, we conclude that in diabetes enalapril corrects the impaired BK response probably by increasing the expression of B2 receptors. The lack of potentiation of BK by Ang-(1-7) is not corrected by this agent.",

Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is implicated in the development of various cancers. As we previously reported, AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), a class of antihypertensive agent, have the potential to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and tumors through the AT1 receptor.

However, while large-scale, randomized controlled intervention trials have demonstrated that treatment of ISH reduces rates of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality and stroke in older hypertensives, control of ISH in the elderly remains poor. The aim of this review of drug treatment of ISH in the elderly is to provide a succinct, practical and clinically orientated guide that summarizes international recommendations and practices with special emphasis on newer approaches. Knowledge of pathophysiological changes in older subjects (decreased elastic artery compliance, reduced plasma renin activity, increased salt sensitivity) and evidence from epidemiological surveys and randomized controlled trials give clear clues that thiazide(-like) diuretics and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists are the drugs of choice in the treatment of ISH. Thus, based on this evidence, American, European and international guidelines for hypertension management still offer the best available recommendations for optimal treatment of ISH in the elderly. Newer combination treatments, especially the fixed combination of a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist and an ACE inhibitor, have valuable benefits in terms of efficacy and tolerability. Use of nitrates added to other antihypertensive medications can provide the practising physician with a further unconventional therapeutic strategy.", 
    "580": "Peptides play an important primary role as a supply of essential amino acids and a source of nitrogen. Recent studies have reported on another role of peptides: having specific amino acid sequences that can express some biological functions in vivo. For an exhaustive study and supply of biologically active peptides, a large-scale screening of protein sources is necessary. Various physiologically functional peptides, such as opioid, immunostimulating, mineral carrier, ACE inhibitory, antihypertensive, and antimicrobial peptides, have been derived from milk protein: both caseins and whey proteins (Meisel, 1998; Korhonen & Pihlanto-Lepp\u00e4l\u00e4, 2001). Milk is known to be a rich source for the supply of bioactive peptides compared to other protein sources such as animal and fish meat, wheat, and soybean proteins. Among the bioactive peptides, ACE inhibitory peptides and antihypertensive peptides have been extensively researched worldwide, because hypertension is a major risk factor in cardiovascular disease, such as heart disease (FitzGerald & Meisel, 2000; Kitts & Weiler, 2003). We discuss the isolation, utilization, and application of bioactive peptides, especially ACE inhibitory peptides and antihypertensive peptides including our recent human studies on their use as a functional food material.", 
    "581": "The protein C (PC) pathway plays an important role in vascular and immune function, and acquired deficiency during sepsis is associated with increased mortality in both animal models and in clinical studies. However, the association of acquired PC deficiency with the pathophysiology of lung injury is unclear. We hypothesized that low PC induced by sepsis would associate with increased pulmonary injury and that replacement with activated protein C (APC) would reverse the activation of pathways associated with injury. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of polymicrobial sepsis, we examined the role of acquired PC deficiency on acute lung injury assessed by analyzing changes in pulmonary pathology, chemokine response, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), and the angiotensin pathway. Acquired PC deficiency was strongly associated with an increase in lung inflammation and drivers of pulmonary injury, including angiotensin (Ang) II, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, and iNOS. In contrast, the protective factor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 was significantly suppressed in animals with acquired PC deficiency. The endothelial protein C receptor, required for the cytoprotective signaling of APC, was significantly increased post-CLP, suggesting a compensatory up-regulation of the signaling receptor. Treatment of septic animals with APC reduced pulmonary pathology, suppressed the macrophage inflammatory protein family chemokine response, iNOS expression, and PAI-1 activity and up-regulated ACE-2 expression with concomitant reduction in AngII peptide. These data demonstrate a clear link between acquired PC deficiency and pulmonary inflammatory response in the rat sepsis model and provide support for the concept of APC as a replacement therapy in acute lung injury associated with acquired PC deficiency.",

Captopril and enalaprilat inhibited the purified enzymes. The immunofluorescence studies indicated that ACE is present in the membrane, cytoplasm and in the cell nucleus. Kinin B1 and B2 receptors were detected by immunofluorescence and showed to be activated by BK and DesR9 BK, increasing the acidification rate which was enhanced in the presence of enalaprilat.

    "583": "Obesity is considered a worldwide public health problem showing an increased prevalence in developing countries, with urgent need for new and more efficient drugs and therapies. Enalapril, an angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), is classically used in anti-hypertensive therapies, however, earlier publications have shown that this drug could also have significant impact on body weight in rats as well as in humans, besides reducing blood pressure. The effect of this drug in the white adipose tissue has been neglected for long time, even considering that most components of the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin system are expressed in this tissue. Furthermore, the adipose tissue is considered today as one of the most important sites for endocrine/inflammatory regulation of appetite and energy output and AngII has been linked to the metabolism in this tissue. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of chronic enalapril treatment in normotensive rats at earlier ages, evaluating body weight, energy homeostasis, lipid profile and serum levels of the hormones leptin and insulin, in the presence of a standard or a palatable hyperlipidic diet regimen for one month. Our results show that enalapril treatment is able to reduce body fat on both diets, without alteration in serum lipid profile. Furthermore, animals receiving enalapril showed reduction in food intake, leptin level and energy intake. In summary, these findings show for the first time that the ACEi enalapril reduces body fat in young normotensive rats and highlights a novel target to treat obesity and associated diseases.", 
    "584": "Angiotensin (AT) II and noradrenaline play major roles in hypertension, stroke and coronary heart disease, which are themselves interlinked. Harmful effects of AT II are not blocked solely by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as it is now evident that AT II is generated by other enzymes such as chymase. Angiotensin II also stimulates noradrenaline release modulated by presynaptic receptors on sympathetic nerves. Numerous studies have defined the action of the AT II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) eprosartan as controlling noradrenergic and adrenergic effects, resulting from actions on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system. Clinical studies have been carried out to assess the effects of ARBs on morbidity and mortality. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial compared the effects of valsartan and the calcium channel blocker (CCB) amlodipine in over 15,000 patients at high risk of a cardiac event. Results showed that blood pressure was reduced by both treatments and cardiac mortality/morbidity was similar in both groups. By contrast, the Morbidity and mortality after Stroke, Eprosartan compared with nitrendipine for Secondary prevention (MOSES) study (n = 1405) generated results which differed from the VALUE study, in that blood pressure was reduced by both eprosartan and nitrendipine, but eprosartan reduced all cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events to a greater extent than nitrendipine. It is also possible that any delayed clinical benefit of eprosartan could be due to reverse cardiac remodelling. Eprosartan, by blocking AT II receptors, reducing noradrenaline release and blocking catecholamine actions, may, therefore, provide greater protection against vascular events than CCBs or other ARBs.", 
    "585": "Moderate elevations in blood pressure translate to significant increases in cardiovascular and cerebro vascular risk. Beneficially, this relationship allows small decreases in blood pressure to be associated with risk reduction. Both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system are involved in hypertension, hence targeting these systems is likely to be of benefit in the treatment of hypertension. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are used for controlling blood pressure and treating heart failure in a broad range of patients, including those with diabetes and the elderly. Not only have ARBs shown good efficacy and tolerability, they also appear to have a protective effect that goes beyond that expected from the reduction of blood pressure. The ARB eprosartan is a nonbiphenyl nontetrazole angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist, which acts to decrease total peripheral resistance. Eprosartan acts at vascular AT1 receptors (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic AT1 receptors, where it inhibits noradrenaline release. In clinical studies, eprosartan has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, whilst avoiding the persistent cough that commonly occurs with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Eprosartan can also be differentiated from other ARBs due to its noradrenergic effects, which other ARBs used at therapeutic doses do not possess. Eprosartan, therefore, represents a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with hypertension, including those with a history of stroke or with co-morbid type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "607": "Impaired fibrinolysis is associated with thromboembolic complications in hypertensive patients. Cardiovascular morbidity/mortality rates have been reported high even after lowering the elevated blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs. We investigated the effects of clinically used dosages of cilazapril on the fibrinolytic system in hypertensive patients. The present study was performed among 30 hypertensive patients (22 women, eight men), who received 2.5-5.0 mg cilazapril daily for 1 month. Before and after the cilazapril treatment, patients' venous blood was drawn for fibrinolytic tests. The fibrinolytic activity was examined utilizing the euglobulin clot lysis time and fibrin plate methods. Using the fibrin plate method, as compared with the pretreatment group, we observed a 57% increased activity in the hypertensive patients receiving cilazapril (P < 0.001). When assessed by the euglobulin clot lysis time method, the activity due to cilazapril treatment was found to be relatively low, although highly significant (approximately 20%, P < 0.001). Changes in fibrinolytic activity were observed in 23 (77%) hypertensive patients after cilazapril treatment; however, their blood pressure remained normal. The remaining seven patients' (23%) blood pressures and fibrinolytic activity did not change significantly after cilazapril treatment. In conclusion, we suggest that the observed differential fibrinolytic activity between the pre and post cilazapril treatment values is due to the plasminogen activators released from the vascular endothelium, which may have been stimulated by cilazapril. It appears that cilazapril is not only an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor but also a stimulator for fibrinolytic activity, which may be an added component in reducing thromboembolic complications in hypertensive patients.",

The authors have summarized findings from key clinical trials published in recent years that contribute to clinician's understanding of how best to optimize therapy. The goals for the management of NSTE-ACS and STEMI are rapid and accurate risk stratification, appropriate and institution-specific triage to interventional versus medical strategies and optimal pharmacologic therapy - all of which provide for a smooth and seamless transition of care between the emergency department and the cardiology service. High-risk features or absolute treatment trigger criteria that support more aggressive medical therapy (i.e., addition of a small molecule gylcoprotein [GP] IIb/IIIa inhibitor to a core regimen of aspirin, enoxaparin or other anticoagulants, and in most cases, clopidogrel) and/or that would direct clinicians toward percutaneous interventional strategies as the preferred modality include, but are not limited to the presence of one or more of the following: 1) elevatedcardiac markers (troponin and/or CK-MB); 2) age older than 65 years; 3) presence of ST-T-wave changes; 4) TIMI Risk Score >/= 5; 5) clinical instability in the setting of suspected NSTE-ACS. Although additional refinements and changes in ACS management are still to come, evidence-based strategies suggest that prompt mechanical revascularization is associated with the best possible clinical outcomes, particularly for patients with high-risk features and in whom benefits of adjunctive, pharmacoinvasive antithrombotic therapies can be consolidated. Transfer for cardiac catheterization/percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is strongly recommended in patients who manifest high-risk features and/or aggressive treatment trigger criteria, so that this high-risk subgroup may receive definitive, interventional and/or cardiology-directed specialty care at appropriate sites of care. When available, interventional management is preferred in these patients. The importance of safe and effective anticoagulation in the spectrum of management strategies has been confirmed, and the evidence in support of enoxaparin and other antithrombotic agents has been reviewed. Dosing recommendations for enoxaparin use in the setting of PCI have been issued by the CATH Panel and have been summarized in this consensus report. Similar recommendations have been presented for the use of oral antiplatelet agents and GP IIb/IIIa antagonists. The addition of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers is also stressed as part of a comprehensive secondary cardioprotective strategy for patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "609": "To test the hypothesis that the bradykinin receptor 2 (BDKRB2) BE1+9/-9 polymorphism affects vascular responses to bradykinin, we measured the effect of intra-arterial bradykinin on forearm blood flow and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) release in 89 normotensive, nonsmoking, white American subjects in whom degradation of bradykinin was blocked by enalaprilat. BE1 genotype frequencies were +9/+9:+9/-9:-9/-9=19:42:28. BE1 genotype was associated with systolic blood pressure (121.4+/-2.8, 113.8+/-1.8, and 110.6+/-1.8 mm Hg in +9/+9, +9/-9, and -9/-9 groups, respectively; P=0.007). In the absence of enalaprilat, bradykinin-stimulated forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, and net t-PA release were similar among genotype groups. Enalaprilat increased basal forearm blood flow (P=0.002) and decreased basal forearm vascular resistance (P=0.01) without affecting blood pressure. Enalaprilat enhanced the effect of bradykinin on forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, and t-PA release (all P<0.001). During enalaprilat, forearm blood flow was significantly lower and forearm vascular resistance was higher in response to bradykinin in the +9/+9 compared with +9/-9 and -9/-9 genotype groups (P=0.04 for both). t-PA release tended to be decreased in response to bradykinin in the +9/+9 group (P=0.08). When analyzed separately by gender, BE1 genotype was associated with bradykinin-stimulated t-PA release in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-treated men but not women (P=0.02 and P=0.77, respectively), after controlling for body mass index. There was no effect of BE1 genotype on responses to the bradykinin type 2 receptor-independent vasodilator methacholine during enalaprilat. In conclusion, the BDKRB2 BE1 polymorphism influences bradykinin type 2 receptor-mediated vasodilation during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "610": "Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited disorders characterized by impaired neuromuscular transmission. Mutations in the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) collagen-like tail subunit gene (COLQ) cause synaptic basal-lamina associated CMS with end-plate AChE deficiency. Here we present the clinical and molecular genetic findings of 22 COLQ-mutant CMS patients, carrying a total of 20 different COLQ mutations, 11 of them had not previously been reported. Typically, patients with esterase deficiency suffer from a severe, progressive weakness with onset at birth or in early infancy. In addition, patients with a late onset showing a mild course of disease are described. AChE inhibitor therapy, beneficial for other forms of CMS, is of no effect in cases of esterase deficiency. The large cohort of COLQ patients studied here enabled us to define additional clinical presentations associated with COLQ mutations that differ from the 'classical' phenotypes: several patients with disease onset at birth or in early infancy presented an unexpected, mild disease course without significant progression of weakness. Moreover, many patients had clinical features reminiscent of limb-girdle CMS with mutations in the recently discovered DOK7 gene, including sparing of eye movements and a predominantly proximal muscle weakness. There was no long-term objective benefit from esterase inhibitors treatment in COLQ patients. Surprisingly, a short-term beneficial effect was observed in four patients and a Tensilon test was positive in two. Treatment with ephedrine was efficient in all five cases where it was administered. The variability of phenotypes caused by COLQ mutations, the divergence from the previously published classical clinical features and an initial positive response to esterase inhibitors in some patients may obscure AChE deficiency as the molecular cause of the disease and delay the start of appropriate therapy. Moreover, overlap with other CMS subtypes and potentially absence of a repetitive compound muscle action potential should be considered in the diagnosis of COLQ-mutated patients.", 
    "611": "Met-Arg-Trp (MRW) has been isolated as an inhibitor for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) from a pepsin-pancreatin digest of spinach ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (IC(50)=0.6 microM). It has been reported that hypotensive activity of ACE-inhibitory peptides derived from food proteins are weakened in spontaneously hypertensive rats older than 25 weeks (old SHR). However, MRW reduced blood pressure after oral administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg in old SHR as well as in younger SHR. MRW exhibited vasorelaxing activity above 1 microM in isolated mesenteric artery from adult and old SHR. The vasorelaxing activity of MRW was blocked by indomethacin and BW A868C, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and an antagonist for DP(1) receptor, respectively. However, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor for nitric oxide synthase, had no effect on the relaxation. The hypotensive activity of MRW was also blocked by indomethacin and BW A868C, respectively, in adult and old SHR. Taken together, the vasorelaxing and hypotensive activities of MRW may be mediated by prostaglandin D(2) and the DP(1) receptor. These findings suggest that the hypotensive activity of MRW is mainly caused by vasorelaxation rather than by ACE-inhibition.",

    "617": "Anemia in heart failure (HF) is increasingly recognized and treated, but little is known about the prevalence and its relation to outcomes in patients hospitalized for decompensated HF in a situation of both reduced and preserved systolic function. We hypothesized that lower hemoglobin is correlated with death during hospitalization and 60 to 90 days postdischarge in patients with HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Patients with Heart Failure is a registry and performance improvement program for hospitalized patients with HF. Study cohorts were defined by admission hemoglobin quartile. Data from 48,612 patients at 259 hospitals showed that half of the total cohort had low hemoglobin (<12.1 g/dl) and that 25% were moderately to severely anemic (lowest hemoglobin quartile, 5 to 10.7 g/dl). Patients with low hemoglobin were older, were more often women and Caucasian, and had preserved systolic function and elevated creatinine. They were also less likely to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers at discharge. Anemic patients had higher in-hospital mortality (4.8% vs 3.0%, lowest vs highest quartile), longer hospital length of stay (6.5 vs 5.3 days), and more readmissions by 90 days (33.1% vs 24.2%) (all p <0.0001). In conclusion, these data reveal a higher prevalence of low hemoglobin in hospitalized patients than noted in randomized HF trials and outpatient registries. Lower hemoglobin is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with HF.",

Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockers have been shown to improve survival in patients with HF and low ejection fraction. However, no large national study has investigated these agents in patients with HF and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. We evaluated a nationwide sample of 13,533 eligible Medicare beneficiaries aged >or=65 years who were hospitalized with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF and had chart documentation of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction between April 1998 and March 1999 or between July 2000 and June 2001. In Cox proportional hazard model accounting for demographic profile, clinical characteristics, treatments, physician specialty, and hospital characteristics, discharge statin therapy was associated with significant improvements in 1- and 3-year mortality (RR 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 0.78; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.79, respectively). Irrespective of total cholesterol level or coronary artery disease status, diabetes, hypertension, and age, statin therapy was associated with significant differences in mortality rates. Similarly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were associated with better survival at 1 year (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95) and 3 years (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98). Beta-blocker therapy was associated with a nonsignificant trend at 1 year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.10) and significant survival benefits at 3 years (RR 0.92%, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97).

In a cohort study, 1693 consecutive patients > or =65 years undergoing major non-cardiac vascular surgery were preoperatively screened for cardiac risk factors and medication. During follow-up (median: 8.2 years), mortality was noted. Hospital mortality occurred in 8.1% and long-term mortality in 28.5%. In multivariate analysis, age, coronary artery disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal failure and diabetes were significantly associated with increased hospital and long-term mortality. Perioperative aspirin (OR: 0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.83), beta-blockers (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.19-0.54) and statins (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18-0.68) were significantly associated with reduced hospital mortality. In addition, aspirin (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53-0.81), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.59-0.92), beta-blockers (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48-0.76) and statins (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87) were significantly associated with reduced long-term mortality. Heterogeneity tests revealed a gradient decrease of mortality risk in patients from low to high age using statins (p=0.03). In conclusion, age is an independent predictor of hospital and long-term mortality in elderly patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Aspirin, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and statins reduce long-term mortality risk. Especially the very elderly may benefit from statin therapy.", 
    "620": "Several large, randomized, multicenter studies in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with chronic proteinuric nephropathies have clearly demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are able to reduce urinary protein excretion and retard renal disease progression. However, the number of patients who reach end-stage renal failure is still considerable and there is a great need to identify therapies that can arrest evolution of kidney damage. Maximizing renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade through combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy has been shown to further increase antiproteinuric and nephroprotective effects of each drug class. However, in order to slow to the greatest extent progression of renal disease, the ideal therapeutic approach for patients with proteinuric nephropathies should be a multimodal strategy including dual RAS blockade, antialdosterone therapy, lipid-lowering agents, smoking cessation, and tight glucose control for diabetes.", 
    "621": "There is a high incidence of hypertension after kidney transplantation, which has been associated with the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, an increased risk for acute rejection, lower graft survival, and increased mortality. The pathogenesis of post-transplant hypertension is multifactorial, and therefore optimum therapy for it is not clearly defined. Historically, use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade in post-transplant hypertension has been limited given concerns of inducing worsening allograft function. Recent data demonstrated that subjects with post-transplant hypertension can be treated effectively with RAS blockers, and that these agents may offer significant additional benefits beyond blood pressure control. Review of the literature suggests that RAS blockers should be considered as useful agents for treatment of post-transplant hypertension not due to transplant renal artery stenosis.", 
    "622": "Diabetic nephropathy and hypertension are the major causes of chronic kidney disease. The renin system plays a key role in the control of blood pressure (BP), as well as in the regulation of renal and adrenal function. Chronic activation of the renin system can lead to organ damage, particularly renal damage; increasing evidence indicates that suppression of the renin system can provide renal protection. Despite the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), the renin system is not completely suppressed. The direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) provide suppression of the entire renin system at the rate-limiting step. Studies in humans with early DRIs indicated potential renoprotective effects, but these agents failed in clinical development due to poor oral bioavailability. Aliskiren is a new orally active DRI with proven BP-lowering effects. Animal studies indicate that aliskiren may provide renal protection, and data from human studies are anticipated.", 
    "623": "In chronic kidney disease (CKD) sympathetic overactivity is stimulated by signals from the diseased kidney activating hypothalamic centers. In addition, breakdown of circulating catecholamines is decreased. Indications for beta-blockers are cardio- and renoprotection. Cardioprotection is important because cardiovascular (CV) death is two- to 20-fold more likely in CKD than end-stage kidney disease; consequently, beta-blockers, with their adverse effect on CV risk profile, should be avoided. Controlled prospective evidence for renoprotection by beta-blockers in nondiabetic CKD with hard end points is lacking, but renoprotection by antihypertensive agents was first documented by administering beta-blockers in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Renoprotection by beta-blockers was seen experimentally. Furthermore, controlled studies documented a beneficial effect on albuminuria as a surrogate marker for renoprotection in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Renin-angiotensin system blockade is the undoubted first-line treatment in CKD. Several points argue for ancillary treatment with beta-blockers: in CKD often four or more different antihypertensive drugs are required and cardiac indications are frequent.", 
    "624": "There is no question about the contributory risk of hypertension in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular (CV) disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Another independent risk factor for CV disease and CKD is proteinuria, which is most commonly caused by dysfunction of the kidney glomerular filter, in particular of the podocyte. Podocytes are highly differentiated pericyte-like cells that are essential to normal kidney function. Moreover, loss of podocytes is a hallmark of diabetic and nondiabetic progressive CKD. Recent data point to an important role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and calcium signaling in the structural and functional integrity of podocytes. Given this scenario, it is desirable to treat hypertension with agents targeting the RAS, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1-receptor blockers (ARB). These agents have proven effects on lowering blood pressure (BP) and can reduce podocyte injury. Here we review the dual effects of RAS blockade on BP and on podocyte function and emphasize BP-dependent and BP-independent effects of this regimen.", 
    "625": "Clinical practice guidelines from many professional societies endorse renin-angiotensin system (RAS) antagonists as first-line antihypertensive agents in diabetes and chronic kidney disease, largely based on putative renoprotective properties that may be blood pressure (BP) independent. To evaluate the relevance of these recommendations to early stage, nonproteinuric nephropathy, studies of primary and secondary prevention of kidney disease were reviewed. Primary prevention studies were reviewed only for diabetic populations. Secondary prevention studies included hypertensive and normotensive, and diabetic and nondiabetic patients with microalbuminuria or low glomerular filtration rate. Overall, use of RAS antagonists as first-line agents does not appear to be as important as control of BP. To achieve protective levels of BP, multiple antihypertensive agents are usually required. Long-term studies with clinically relevant outcomes (death and loss of kidney function) are needed to clarify whether specific agents provide benefits beyond that of BP control in early stage, nonproteinuric nephropathy.", 
    "626": "Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 or higher, affects approximately 20 million people in the United States. Aggressive management of blood pressure is critical to slow the decline in renal function. Despite adequate control, however, patients continue to progress to end-stage renal disease. A surrogate marker for renal parenchymal injury is the presence of proteinuria. Blood pressure reduction per se has been shown to decrease proteinuria. However, certain classes of antihypertensive agents, namely the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, exert antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects that are in addition to, but independent of, blood pressure lowering. This article reviews the beneficial renoprotective effects of various classes of antihypertensive agents in chronic kidney disease.", 
    "627": "Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains uncontrolled despite using at least three antihypertensive medications in effective doses, ideally including a diuretic. Stricter blood pressure goals, higher obesity rates, older age, and increased use of certain exogenous substances are related to an increasing prevalence of resistant hypertension. The evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension focuses on identifying contributing factors and secondary causes of hypertension including hyperaldosteronism, obstructive sleep apnea, renal artery stenosis, and pheochromocytoma. Hyperaldosteronism is now recognized as the most common secondary cause and all patients with resistant hypertension should be screened with a plasma aldosterone-renin ratio even if the serum potassium level is normal. Treatment includes reversal of contributing factors, appropriate treatment of secondary causes, and use of effective multidrug regimens. Recent studies indicate that the addition of spironolactone to standard treatment regimens induces significant blood pressure reduction in patients with resistant hypertension.",

    "629": "After determination of genotypes of RAS polymorphism by PCR, 64 renal transplant recipients were randomly allocated to one of four groups: the first and second groups were treated with E (E+: 10 mg/day) and L (L+: 50 mg/day) alone, respectively. The third group received E+L (E+L+: 10 + 50 mg/day), and the forth group received no medication (E-L-). The subjects were followed for 8 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, the E group changed to L and vice versa as a cross-over design. They were followed for another 8 weeks. Before and after treatment, we checked 8-OHdG and malondialdehyde (MDA) as biomarkers of DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, respectively.", 
    "630": "8-OHdG levels were significantly decreased after treatment in the E+L+ and L+ groups (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, respectively). Only the TT genotype of AGT had the most antioxidative role regarding the treatment (P = 0.01). We found a remarkable correlation between MDA and DNA damage levels before and after intervention (r = 0.48, P < 0.001; r = 0.35, P = 0.006).",

At the same level of blood pressure (BP) control, we evaluated which is superior, dual blockade of the rennin-angiotensin system (RAS) with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) receptor blockade (ARB) or single blockade of ARB to reduce proteinuria and to preserve renal function in patients with CGN.", 
    "633": "In this prospective, parallel, open study of 86 patients with CGN, we compared the effects on proteinuria and renal functions of 36 months with comparable blood pressure (BP) control achieved by candesartan cilexetil (candesartan, 4-12 mg/day) or benazepril hydrochrolide (benazepril, 2.5-10 mg/day) with candesartan (4 mg/day). Aiming at BP 125/75 mmHg or less, the dose of candesartan (single blockade) or benazepril (dual blockade) was increased.", 
    "634": "Dual blockade decreased proteinuria more than single blockade with ARB (-42.3 vs. -60.5%, P < 0.01). Renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration fraction (GFR) did not change significantly in either group. The filtration fraction (FF) decreased dual blockade more than single blockade (-1.7 vs. -19.0%, P < 0.05). Decreased FF was associated with the reduction of proteinuria (P < 0.05). Six percent of patients with dual blockade were not able to continue the study because of a dry cough.", 
    "635": "Long-term dual blockade decreased proteinuria more than single blockade with ARB. Although ARB and ACEI have a glomerular size-selective function for proteinuria, a greater antiproteinuric effect may depend on renal hemodynamics, especially FF. Increased levels of bradykinin after ACEI can decrease FF and ameliorate proteinuria. Dry cough is a significant adverse effect of ACE inhibitor.",

Thirty-three relevant publications in 2000-2006 describing care in 77,588 CKD patients were reviewed. Baseline demographic traits and provider specialty were considered as correlates of delivered care. Testing consistent with K/DOQI guidelines and prevalence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEi/ARB) medication prescriptions were ascertained from billing claims.

Nephrology referral correlated with increased likelihood of testing for parathyroid hormone and phosphorus after adjustment for baseline patient factors. Use of ACEi/ARB medications was more common among patients with nephrology contact (50.0 vs. 30.0%; P = 0.008) but appeared largely driven by higher comorbidity burden.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (beta = -0.381, p = 0.02) and GPx (beta = -0.509, p < 0.001) were independently related to proteinuria levels. Both cilazapril and simvastatin significantly improved GPx, SOD, PCO, and proteinuria. When HBO was combined with either drug, the above markers further improved (p < 0.001). Both regimens caused distinct histological features, while the combination of HBO made much significant histological improvement.",

Aliskiren taken once a day, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, has been shown to be effective in reducing blood pressure and is generally well tolerated. Based on an extensive clinical trials program, aliskiren was approved for the treatment of hypertension in March 2007 (as Tekturna; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ, USA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and in August 2007 (as Rasilez, Enviage, Sprimeo, Tekturna and Riprazo, all from Novartis) for the treatment of essential hypertension by the European Commission. Although the indication for aliskiren is treatment of essential hypertension, benefits similar to those demonstrated with certain angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are anticipated for aliskiren. Some of the 44 trials with aliskiren are listed in Table II. Inhibition of renin, which is the first and rate-limiting step in the renin-angiotensin pathway has theoretical advantages over either ACE inhibitors or ARBs.",

We designed a controlled, randomized pilot study aimed to test the hypothesis that the dual RAS blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEi) + angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) can be more effective in decreasing LV hypertrophy and improving diastolic function than a largely employed association such as ACEi + calcium-antagonist (Ca-A).",

Based on discharge use of evidence-based medications, the patients were divided into those using 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 medications. The impact of medications on 1-year mortality was assessed for patients younger than 75 years and 75 years and older. Mean age of the patients was 63+/-13 years (71% male). The unadjusted 1-year mortality post-MI was 18.3% and 52.7% for young and elderly patients, respectively. Compared with patients with 0 medications, the adjusted odds ratio for 1-year mortality was lower in patients with 1, 2, 3, and 4 medications in both groups.

In this study we applied a pig model of renovascular hypertension to investigate the AT(1)R in vivo with positron-emission tomography (PET) and in vitro with quantitative autoradiography. AT(1)R PET measurements were performed with the radioligand [(11)C]KR31173 in 11 control pigs and in 13 pigs with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis; 4 were treated with lisinopril for 2 weeks before PET imaging. The radioligand impulse response function was calculated by deconvolution analysis of the renal time-activity curves. Radioligand binding was quantified by the 80-minute retention of the impulse response function. Median values and interquartile ranges were used to illustrate group statistics. Radioligand retention was significantly increased (P=0.044) in hypoperfused kidneys of untreated (0.225; range: 0.150 to 0.373) and lisinopril-treated (0.237; range:0.224 to 0.272) animals compared with controls (0.142; range:0.096 to 0.156). Increased binding of [(11)C]KR31173 documented by PET in vivo was confirmed by in vitro autoradiography. Both in vivo and in vitro binding measurements showed that the effect of renal artery stenosis on the AT(1)R was not abolished by lisinopril treatment. These studies provide insight into kidney biology as the first in vivo/in vitro experimental evidence about AT(1)R regulation in response to reduced perfusion of the kidney. The findings support the concept of introducing AT(1)R PET as a diagnostic biomarker of renovascular disease.",

During a mean follow-up of 3.01+/-1.86 years postrenal transplant, 66 patients died and 67 additional patients experienced at least one nonfatal cardiac-related complication. Patients with LV systolic dysfunction were at considerably higher risk for cardiac complications (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, P=0.01) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.0, P=0.01) after transplantation.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is pivotal in the pathophysiology of CVD and renal disease and appears to place individuals at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) and renal events. Results from many large-scale, long-term clinical trials have demonstrated that RAAS blockade with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) can significantly decrease CV and renal morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patients. Some of the clinical benefits derived from use of these agents appears to be independent of their ability to lower blood pressure. The combined use of an ACEI and an ARB for antihypertensive therapy has begun to receive considerable attention. Such an approach may seem counterintuitive, but ACEIs and ARBs have distinct and potentially complementary pharmacologic effects. Results from clinical trials thus far suggest that combination therapy with an ACEI plus an ARB may be a rational choice in patients with chronic activation of the RAAS, including those with heart failure or impaired left ventricular systolic function, diabetes, proteinuria, impaired renal function, recent myocardial infarction, or multiple CV risk factors. Results from ongoing, large-scale, clinical endpoint trials will provide important additional information about the benefits of dual RAAS inhibition in patients at high risk for CV morbidity and mortality.",

Moreover, expression of MCP-1 increased by 35.1+/-4.2% in Ad-ACE2 transfected THP-1 after incubation with Ang II and A779 compared to that with AngII alone.

She was found to have high blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. An ACE-inhibitor was prescribed but her renal function rapidly worsened and she was admitted to our nephrology unit. On admission serum creatinine was 9.4 mg/dl, potassium 6.8 mmol/l, haemoglobin 7.7 g/dl, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide 29894 pg/ml. A central venous catheter was inserted and haemodialysis was started. She underwent a renal biopsy which showed kappa LCDD. Bone marrow aspiration and bone biopsy demonstrated kappa light chain multiple myeloma. Echocardiographic findings were consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy. Thalidomide and dexamethasone were prescribed, and a peritoneal catheter was inserted. Peritoneal dialysis has now been performed for 15 months without complications.",

The clinical management initially addressed the cardiovascular symptoms without paying sufficient attention to the pre-existing slight increase in our patient's serum creatinine. However cardiac involvement is a quite uncommon presentation of LCDD, and this unusual case suggests that the onset of acute arrhythmias associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy and impaired renal function might be related to LCDD.",

However, after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, FPH and ultrafiltrate had similar ACE-inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 90 microg/mL), indicating that FPH peptides act as \"pro-drug type\" inhibitors and that enrichment by ultrafiltration may be unnecessary. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry confirmed that the molecular weights of major peaks were <1 kDa regardless of ultrafiltration. ACE-inhibitory activities of digested hydrolysates were not significantly affected by preincubation with ACE ( P > 0.05) and exhibited a competitive inhibitory mode. A permeability assay using fully differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells showed an apical to basolateral transport of peptides that ranged from approximately 2 to 20% after 2 h at 37 degrees C.

The concept of metabolic syndrome, which is a constellation of metabolic disturbances, has crystallized over the last 80 years with the aim of identifying those at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These patients have visceral obesity and insulin resistance characterized by hypertyriglyceridemia. Recently, it has been realized that they are also at an increased risk of chronic renal disease. Release of adipocytokines leads to endothelial dysfunction. There is also activation of systemic and local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress, and impaired fibrinolysis. This leads to glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and ultimately end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Treatment consists of lifestyle modifications along with optimal control of blood pressure, blood sugar and lipids. Metformin and thiazolidenidiones reduce insulin resistance; while angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers reduce proteinuria and have a renoprotective effect. Exciting new medical therapies on the horizon include rimonabant a cannabinoid receptor type 1 antagonist, soy proteins, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist.

However, development of medicines targeting vascular wall disease is complicated by the lack of reliable biomarkers. In this study, we took a novel approach to identify circulating biomarkers indicative of drug efficacy by reducing the complexity of the in vivo system to the level where neither disease progression nor drug treatment was associated with the changes in plasma cholesterol. RESULTS: ApoE-/- mice were treated with an ACE inhibitor ramipril and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin. Ramipril significantly reduced the size of atherosclerotic plaques in brachiocephalic arteries, however simvastatin paradoxically stimulated atherogenesis. Both effects occurred without changes in plasma cholesterol. Blood and vascular samples were obtained from the same animals. In the whole blood RNA samples, expression of MMP9, CD14 and IL-1RN reflected pro-and anti-atherogenic drug effects. In the plasma, several proteins, e.g. IL-1beta, IL-18 and MMP9 followed similar trends while protein readout was less sensitive than RNA analysis. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have identified inflammation-related whole blood RNA and plasma protein markers reflecting anti-atherogenic effects of ramipril and pro-atherogenic effects of simwastatin in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. This opens an opportunity for early, non-invasive detection of direct drug effects on atherosclerotic plaques in complex in vivo systems.",

We combine analysis of data from a randomized trial with a theoretical model of the influence that IT has on the acquisition of new medical knowledge. Although the theoretical framework we develop is conventionally microeconomic, the model highlights the non-market and non-pecuniary influence activities that have been emphasized in the sociological literature on technology diffusion. We report three findings. First, empirical evidence and theoretical reasoning suggests that computer-based decision support will speed the diffusion of new medical knowledge when physicians are coping with information overload. Second, spillover effects will likely lead to \"underinvestment\" in this decision support technology. Third, alternative financing strategies common to new IT, such as the use of marketing dollars to pay for the decision support systems, may lead to undesirable outcomes if physician information overload is sufficiently severe and if there is significant ambiguity in how best to respond to the clinical issues identified by the computer. This is the first paper to analyze empirically and theoretically how computer-based decision support influences the acquisition of new knowledge by physicians.",

Along with routine tests, the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) measured with ELISA using test-systems (BCM Diagnostics, USA) and reagents (R&D, England) have been determined. The administration of perindopril did not cause side-effects, including arterial hypotonia after the first dosage, in patients in the acute period of atherothrombotic ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Perindopril may decrease the activity of MMP-9 in these patients and produces an anticytokine effect. Some similar mechanisms of ischemic lesions of the heart and the brain and a commonness of biochemical \"response\" to the same medical intervention (the administration of an ACE inhibitor perindopril) in patients of both groups were found.

The incidence of hypertension is increasing globally and the rate of blood pressure control remains inadequate. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a crucial role in volume regulation and maintenance of blood pressure. Pathological activation of RAAS results in chronic hypertension and consequent end organ damage. Most patients with hypertension require combination therapy using agents with complimentary mechanisms of action. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) together with an agent blocking the RAAS such as an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are widely used effective anti-hypertensive therapy. Aliskiren is an orally effective direct renin inhibitor that blocks the generation of angiotensin I from angiotensinogen, the rate limiting step of RAAS activation. Studies have shown equivalent antihypertensive efficacy of aliskiren when compared to existing medications such as HCTZ, ACE inhibitors and ARBs.

The angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) system plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis, and ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) seem to have vasculoprotective and antiproliferative effects as well as a direct anti-atherogenic effect. ACE-I also promote the degradation of bradykinin and the release of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator; further, they have shown important implications for vascular oxidative stress. Other studies have suggested that ACE-I may also improve endothelial dysfunction. ACE-I are useful for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical and subclinical PAD.

Long-term treatment with trandolapril in patients with reduced left ventricular function soon after AMI significantly reduced the risk of overall mortality, mortality from CV causes, sudden death, and the development of severe CHF. Treatment with trandolapril after AMI complicated by left ventricular dysfunction appears to be of considerable importance in patients with diabetes mellitus by saving lives and substantially reducing the risk of progression to severe CHF as well. Moreover, trandolapril reduces progression to proteinuria in high-risk patients. Some of the advantages of trandolapril over other ACE inhibitors are the wide spectrum of patient populations studied, the well established dosage and its proven trough-to-peak effect ratios permitting a safe once-a-day administration.",

In the present work, a biodistribution study in Swiss mice of [(125)I]-BPP 10c in the absence or in the presence of a saturating concentration of captopril, a selective active-site inhibitor of sACE, demonstrated that: (1) [(125)I]-BPP 10c was present in several organs and the renal absorption was significantly high; (2) [(125)I]-BPP 10c showed a clear preference for the kidney, maintaining a high concentration in this organ in the presence of captopril for at least 3h; (3) The residual amount of [(125)I]-BPP 10c in the kidney of animals simultaneously treated with captopril suggest that the peptide can interact with other targets different from sACE in this organ. We also showed that Cy3-labeled BPP 10c was internalized by human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T).

Myocardial diastolic function (Ve) is a known marker of cardiovascular prognosis. It could potentially indicate the effects of preventive therapy if evaluated by tissue Doppler. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramipril has beneficial effects on Ve. In this study, 16 subjects on insulin therapy (eight receiving 10 mg ramipril/day compared to eight matched controls who were not treated with an ACE inhibitor) were followed up for a period of nine months. Myocardial and vascular function were assessed by tissue Doppler and ultrasound. In the ramipril group, Ve improved significantly after nine months of treatment (7.8+/-0.9 cm/s to 8.6+/-0.9 cm/s, p<0.04). Systolic blood pressure and intima media thickness (IMT) demonstrated a trend towards improvement. In controls, Ve remained unchanged and there was a trend towards deterioration in stiffness index beta (p<0.07). In conclusion, the observed improvement of myocardial diastolic function with ramipril in patients with T2DM is an encouraging result.

These agents are contraindicated during the second half of pregnancy because prior studies have demonstrated that use of ACE inhibitors late in pregnancy can cause oligohydramnios, fetal growth restriction, skull defects, infant anuria and renal failure, and death. Interestingly, little was known about the effects of ACE inhibitors when taken early during pregnancy. The purpose of the ACE Inhibitors in Early Pregnancy study was to clarify the safety of the use of ACE inhibitors during pregnancy by conducting an epidemiologic study using a large Medicaid database in which medications prescribed for pregnant women as a part of routine care and infant outcomes were studied. In the study, among 209 infants with first trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors, 7.1% had any major congenital malformation. Compared with 29,096 infants with no exposure to any antihypertensive medication, among whom 2.6% had any major congenital malformation, the adjusted risk of major congenital malformations was increased more than 2-fold. The risks of any congenital malformations and risks of specific organ system malformations, including cardiac malformations, were not increased in 202 infants with first trimester exposure to other antihypertensives when compared with infants with no antihypertensive exposure. Although this was an exploratory study whose findings should be confirmed, there are some important clinical insights that can be drawn from the study's conclusions. Further information on the pregnancy risks of ACE inhibitors and almost every other medication potentially used by pregnant women is needed. Thus, well-controlled studies to identify these risks should be undertaken. Until such information is available, alternative medications to ACE inhibitors should be considered in women of child-bearing age who are pregnant or who are likely to become pregnant while taking the medication.",

We investigated the hypothesis that angiotensin II type 1 or angiotensin II type 2 receptors or NO synthase mediate renal oxygenation responses to ACEI. Three weeks after left renal artery clipping, kidney function, oxygen (O(2)) use, renal blood flow, renal cortical blood flow, and renal cortical oxygen tension (Po(2)) were measured after acute administration of an ACEI (enalaprilat) and after acute administration of ACEI following acute administration of an angiotensin II type 1 or angiotensin II type 2 receptor blocker (candesartan or PD-123,319) or an NO synthase blocker (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester with control of renal perfusion pressure) and compared with mechanical reduction in renal perfusion pressure to the levels after ACEI. The basal renal cortical Po(2) of clipped kidneys was significantly lower than contralateral kidneys (35+/-1 versus 51+/-1 mm Hg; n=40 each). ACEI lowered renal venous Po(2), cortical Po(2), renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and cortical blood flow and increased the renal vascular resistance in the clipped kidney, whereas mechanical reduction in renal perfusion pressure was ineffective. PD-123,319 and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, but not candesartan, reduced the Po(2) of clipped kidneys and blocked the fall in Po(2) with acute ACEI administration. In conclusion, oxygen availability in the clipped kidney is maintained by angiotensin II generation, angiotensin II type 2 receptors, and NO synthase. This discloses a novel mechanism whereby angiotensin can prevent hypoxia in a kidney challenged with a reduced perfusion pressure.",

We examined the effect of pioglitazone on hypertensive cardiovascular injury and the significance of combination of pioglitazone with angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were orally given pioglitazone, candesartan, or combined pioglitazone and candesartan for 4 weeks to compare their effects on cardiovascular injury. Pioglitazone, without lowering blood pressure, significantly suppressed cardiac inflammation and fibrosis and reduced vascular endothelial dysfunction, and these beneficial effects were associated with the reduction of superoxide by inhibition of cardiovascular NADPH oxidase. Thus, pioglitazone protects against hypertensive cardiovascular injury, by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS). Combination of pioglitazone and candesartan suppressed cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis of SHRSP to a greater extent than either monotherapy, and reduced vascular endothelial dysfunction of SHRSP more than either monotherapy. Furthermore, more beneficial effects of their combination on cardiovascular injury were associated with more reduction of NADPH oxidase-mediated cardiovascular ROS. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, we examined cardiovascular NADPH oxidase subunits. Pioglitazone monotherapy significantly attenuated cardiovascular p22(phox) and Rac1 in SHRSP, whereas pioglitazone combined with candesartan more attenuated p22(phox) and significantly reduced Nox1. Thus, additive suppression of cardiovascular NADPH oxidase by the combination was attributed to its additive attenuation of p22(phox) and Nox1 protein levels. In conclusion, we showed that pioglitazone protected against hypertensive cardiovascular damage, and the combination of pioglitazone and candesartan exerted more beneficial effects on hypertensive cardiovascular injury by more suppressing ROS.",

Addition of receptor-associated protein to MPCM-injured mesangial cells with and without ACE-I increased the amount of tissue plasminogen activator protein detected in mesangial cell culture supernatants without affecting the protein levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The ability of ACE-I to reduce fibronectin was diminished in the presence of receptor-associated protein. ACE-I induced an increase in mesangial cell MMP9 mRNA, but reduced the MMP9 enzyme activity detected in mesangial cell supernatants. Mesangial cell lysates from ACE-I-treated cells were able to bind immobilized fibronectin at higher dilutions than cell lysates from untreated cells. Flow cytometry showed that MPCM induced an increase in LRP surface expression in mesangial cells over that in control cells and that this expression was further increased by ACE-I treatment. The increase in LRP expression in response to ACE-I was also observed by Western blotting. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from cells following a 24-h exposure to MPCM with and without ACE-I demonstrated that there was no change in LRP mRNA expression upon ACE-I treatment. In conclusion, we show that ACE-I treatment is able to modulate mesangial cell-surface expression of LRP, providing an additional mechanism whereby ACE-Is can mediate anti-fibrotic actions independent of their hemodynamic actions.",

Before MS analysis, liquid chromatographic method with suitable mobile phase composition was developed. The separation was done on SunFire 100 mm x 4.6 mm 3.5 microm particle size column. The mobile phases which consisted of methanol-ammonium acetate buffer-acetic acid, in different ratios, were used in a preliminary study. Flow rate was 0.3 mL min(-1). Under these conditions, percent of methanol, concentration of ammonium acetate buffer and acetic acid content were tested simultaneously applying central composite design (CCD) and artificial neural network (ANN). The combinations of experimental design (ED) and ANN present powerful technique in method optimization. Input and output variables from CCD were used for network training, verification and testing. Multiple layer perceptron (MLP) with back propagation (BP) algorithm was chosen for network training. When the optimal neural topology was selected, network was trained by adjusting strength of connections between neurons in order to adapt the outputs of whole network to be closer to the desired outputs, or to minimize the sum of the squared errors. From the method optimization the following mobile phase composition was selected as appropriate: methanol-10 mM ammonium acetate buffer-acidic acid (80:19.5:0.5 v/v/v). This mobile phase was used as inlet for MS. According to molecular structure and literature data, electrospray positive ion mode was applied for analysis of fosinopril sodium and its impurities. The proposed method could be used for screening of fosinopril sodium impurities in bulk and pharmaceuticals, as well as for tracking the degradation under stress conditions.", 
    "740": "Various diseases such as arterial hypertension, diabetes and obesity result in renal diseases which are often irreversible and resistant to currently available therapies. Beside the control of glycemia in diabetic patients, only the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is effective in reducing the occurrence of glomerulosclerosis and its development towards terminal renal failure. Inhibition of this system is based on the use of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists. For many years, the beneficial effects of these two classes of drugs were attributed mainly to their interference with angiotensin II. However, recent in vitro and in vivo evidences strongly suggest that bradykinin B2 receptor is also involved in the nephroprotective effects of these drugs. A compelling evidence is the finding that the development of glomerulosclerosis is more severe in knock-out B2 receptor mice. The nephroprotective effect of B2 receptor could be the consequence of a reduction of proteinuria, glomerular and interstitial fibrosis, cell proliferation and of the oxidative stress through the contribution of several well identified mechanisms. It is proposed that B2 receptor agonists can offer a novel therapeutic avenue in the treatment of nephropathies associated with diabetes or other vascular diseases.",

Modulation of ACE activity through the use of inhibitors may thus positively affect disease expression. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the efficacy of an ACE inhibitor (2.5 mg ramipril) in 8 patients with McArdle's disease. End-points were changes in parameters of exercise physiology (cycloergometer and muscle 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy), quality of life (QoL) according to the Short Form 36 (SF-36), and disability according to the World Health Organization-Disability Assessment Scale II (WHO-DAS II). Patients had lower QoL and higher disability than controls. Measures of exercise physiology were not changed by ramipril in the whole group, but treatment induced higher peak VO2 (P = 0.017) in ACE D/D patients, yet not in I/D patients. Treatment significantly improved disability (P < 0.05). McArdle's disease is a disabling condition affecting patients' QoL. Treatment with ramipril improves disability and modifies exercise physiology only in D/D patients, raising the possibility of a differential haplotype-linked sensitivity to the treatment.",

The average concentration of the sum of VPP and IPP in the screened cheese varieties varied to a large extent, and substantial variations were obtained for individual samples within the cheese varieties. The lowest average concentration of the 2 tri-petides was found in L'Etivaz \u00e0 rebibes (n = 3) at 19.1 mg/kg, whereas Appenzeller 1/4 fat (n = 4) contained the greatest concentration at 182.2 mg/kg. In individual samples, the total concentration of VPP and IPP varied between 1.6 and 424.5 mg/kg. With the exception of a 10-yr-old cheese, VPP was always present at greater concentrations than IPP. Milk pretreatment, cultures, scalding conditions, and ripening time were identified as the key factors influencing the concentration of these 2 naturally occurring bioactive peptides in cheese. The results of the present study show that various traditional cheese varieties contain, on average, similar concentrations of the 2 antihypertensive peptides to the recently developed fermented milk products with blood pressure-lowering property. This may serve as a basis for the development of a functional cheese with blood pressure-lowering property.",

    "753": "Hyperglycemia, which is the biochemical hallmark of type 2 diabetes, mainly results from insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the latter is crucial in the development of the disease because diabetes cannot occur without an impairment of insulin secretion. Beta-cell failure is also responsible for progressive loss of metabolic control in type 2 diabetic patients and the eventual need for insulin treatment. An impairment of beta-cell function can be detected in several ways and can be observed already in pre-diabetic individuals. Histopathology studies documented that beta-cell volume is reduced in pre-diabetes and, to a greater extent, in type 2 diabetes mainly because the apoptotic rate of beta-cells is increased whereas neogenesis is intact. All anti-diabetic agents can improve, directly or indirectly, beta-cell function. However, only PPAR-gamma agonists and incretin-mimetic agents seem to have favorable effects on beta-cell morphology and volume. Many trials showed that type 2 diabetes can be prevented but few of them directly addressed the issue of beta-cell protection by the intervention used in the study. It is reasonable to conclude that in these trials diabetes prevention, which was based on the use of lifestyle changes (diet and/or exercise) or different drugs (tolbutamide, acarbose, metformin, glitazones, bezafibrate, orlistat, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or pravastatin), depended also, or mainly, on a protection of the beta-cells but in most studies data on insulin secretion are not available or are insufficient to draw firm conclusions. The mechanisms of beta-cell protection in these trials, if any, remain unknown. They could be various and likely included reduced glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidant stress and/or apoptosis, an amelioration of islet blood flow and/or favorable changes in cation balance within the islets. Contrasting the decline and the eventual failure of beta-cells is crucial in preventing type 2 diabetes as well as in changing the natural history of the disease, when it occurs. The protection can be achieved in several ways but any strategy should include a change in lifestyle in order to generate a healthier islet milieu. Among anti-diabetic drugs, PPAR-gamma agonists and incretin-mimetic agents are the most promising in the protection. Among other drugs, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system might play a significant role. The increased worldwide diffusion of type 2 diabetes and the progressive loss of metabolic control in affected patients are clear demonstrations that the strategies to protect the beta-cells implemented so far, if any, were largely inadequate. Anti-diabetic agents targeting the intimate mechanisms of beta-cell damage might change the scenario in the near future.",

Treatment with C1 inhibitor concentrate (1000u) made the clinical symptoms disappear within 20 minutes.

First, we studied the urinary proteome of 18 IgAN patients (toward 20 healthy controls) who had been chronically treated with ACEi by using 2-D PAGE coupled to nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. We identified 3 proteins, kininogen (p = 0.02), inter-alpha-trypsin-inhibitor heavy chain 4 (35 kDa fragment) (p = 0.02) and transthyretin (p<0.0001), whose urinary excretion was different in IgAN patients' responders when compared to those who had not responded to ACEi. A reduction of daily proteinuria >50% and a stable renal function over time were used to classify patients as responders. Then, we adopted immunoblotting to confirm the predictive power of one of the above proteins, kininogen, in 20 patients with biopsy-proven IgAN, before starting any therapy. Thus, we confirmed that very low levels of kininogen urine excretion were indeed predictive of an inadequate or absent clinical response to ACEi therapy of IgAN patients, after 6-month follow-up. Concluding, the analysis of urine proteome of IgAN patients generated a set of proteins which distinguished subjects responsive to ACEi from those unresponsive to the inhibition of renin-angiotensin system (RAS).",

The apical Gly-Sar uptake rate in Calu-3 cells followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 1.3 +/- 0.3 mM and a Vmax value of 0.60 +/- 0.06 nmol cm(-2) min(-1). Transepithelial apical to basolateral transport of 50 microM [3H]-labelled Gly-Sar across the Calu-3 cell monolayer was pH-dependent. The Gly-Sar flux was significantly reduced in the presence of delta-aminolevulinic acid (2.5 mM), cephalexin (25 mM), and captopril (25 mM; p < 0.05, n = 3). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed the presence of both hPEPT1 and hPEPT2 mRNA in the Calu-3 cells. These findings were confirmed in healthy human bronchial cDNA. Restriction-endonuclease analysis identified hPEPT2 in Calu-3 cells to be the hPEPT2*1 haplotype. Western blotting demonstrated expression of the hPEPT1 protein (approximately 80 kDa), and the immunolabel was mainly localized in the apical membrane as judged by immunolocalization studies using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This work presents for the first time hPEPT1 and hPEPT2*1 expression in human Calu-3 cells.

The relationship between baseline and year-1 hemoglobin and treatment on end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and ESRD or death was evaluated using multivariate Cox models (covariates: baseline hemoglobin, proteinuria, serum albumin, serum creatinine, and year-1 hemoglobin). Compared with placebo, losartan treatment was associated with a significant decrease of hemoglobin, with the largest between-group difference at 1 year. After adjustment, there were significant relative risk reductions for losartan compared with placebo for ESRD and for ESRD or death regardless of the baseline hemoglobin even in those patients with a baseline hemoglobin below 120 g l(-1). Hence, the renoprotective properties of losartan were maintained despite a significant lowering of the hemoglobin concentration.",

Projected data from population-based studies in the US indicate that the number of adults with AF will swell by 2.5-3.0-fold by 2050. Despite advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies for rhythm or rate control in patients with AF, primary prevention with 'upstream' therapy and risk factor modification is likely to produce a far greater effect in the general population than specific interventions. Rapidly developing experimental work has provided new insights into AF pathophysiology that will lead to new mechanism-based therapies. Agents targeting inflammation, oxidative injury, atrial myocyte metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis, have theoretical advantages as novel therapeutic strategies. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, statins, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown antiarrhythmic potential, over and above any effect related to the treatment of underlying heart disease. These agents could be exploited to prevent or delay atrial remodeling in patients with AF, even in the absence of routine indications for such therapy. This Review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the possible preventive and reverse remodeling roles of statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids in AF.",

The proteinuria and effects of eplerenone alone or combined with enalapril on nephrin/podocin abundance in rats with NS have not yet been studied. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the early (beginning 2 days before NS induction) and late (beginning 2 wk after NS induction) effects of eplerenone and enalapril, alone or combined, on proteinuria and nephrin/podocin abundance in rats with adriamycin-induced NS. Adriamycin caused a significant increase in daily protein excretion (U(pr)V; from 26.96 +/- 3.43 to 958.57 +/- 56.7 mg/day, P < 0.001) and cumulative proteinuria [from 900.33 +/- 135.5 to 22,490.62 +/- 931.26 mg (P < 0.001)] during 6 wk. Early treatment with enalapril significantly decreased U(pr)V from 958.6 +/- 56.7 to 600.31 +/- 65.13 mg/day (P < 0.001) and cumulative proteinuria to 12,842.37 +/- 1,798.17 mg/6 wk (P < 0.001). Similarly, early treatment with eplerenone produced a profound antiproteinuric effect: U(pr)V decreased from 958.57 +/- 56.7 to 593.38 +/- 21.83 mg/day, P < 0.001, and cumulative proteinuria to 16,601.84 +/- 1,334.31 mg/6 wk; P < 0.001. An additive effect was obtained when enalapril and eplerenone were combined: U(pr)V decreased from 958.57 +/- 56.69 to 424.17 +/- 38.54 mg/day, P < 0.001, and cumulative protein excretion declined to 10,252.88 +/- 1,011.3 mg/6 wk, P < 0.001. These antiproteinuric effects were associated with substantial preservation of glomerular nephrin and podocin. In contrast, late treatment with either enalapril or eplerenone alone or combined mildly decreased U(pr)V and cumulative proteinuria. Thus pretreatment with eplerenone or enalapril is effective in reducing daily and cumulative protein excretion and preservation of nephrin/podocin. More profound antiproteinuric effects were obtained when enalapril and eplerenone were combined.", 
    "770": "Exposure to mercury at nanomolar level affects cardiac function but its effects on vascular reactivity have yet to be investigated. Pressor responses to phenylephrine (PHE) were investigated in perfused rat tail arteries before and after treatment with 6 nM HgCl2 during 1 h, in the presence (E+) and absence (E-) of endothelium, after L-NAME (10(-4) M), indomethacin (10(-5 )M), enalaprilate (1 microM), tempol (1 microM) and deferoxamine (300 microM) treatments. HgCl2 increased sensitivity (pD2) without modifying the maximum response (Emax) to PHE, but the pD2 increase was abolished after endothelial damage. L-NAME treatment increased pD2 and Emax. However, in the presence of HgCl2, this increase was smaller, and it did not modify Emax. After indomethacin treatment, the increase of pD2 induced by HgCl2 was maintained. Enalaprilate, tempol and deferoxamine reversed the increase of pD2 evoked by HgCl2. HgCl2 increased the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity explaining the result obtained with enalaprilate. Results suggest that at nanomolar concentrations HgCl2 increase the vascular reactivity to PHE. This response is endothelium mediated and involves the reduction of NO bioavailability and the action of reactive oxygen species. The local ACE participates in mercury actions and depends on the angiotensin II generation.", 
    "771": "Clinical studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT(1))-antagonist reduces cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate underlying mechanisms of the AT(1)-antagonist telmisartan in comparison to the ACE-inhibitor ramipril on advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Thirty-two-week-old apolipoprotein E deficient mice (n=60) exhibiting advanced atherosclerotic lesions were fed a chow diet supplemented with ramipril or telmisartan for 16 weeks. Twenty mice received a standard diet. Mice receiving telmisartan had a 38% and mice receiving ramipril had a 18% reduction in progression of atherosclerotic lesion size within the innominate artery. Signs of plaque instability such as frequency of intra-plaque hemorrhage and size of the necrotic cores were reduced in mice receiving telmisartan. Furthermore, telmisartan-treated mice had fewer macrophages and reduced expression of early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) within the lesions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed reduced DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) in the aorta of telmisartan-treated mice. In vitro studies in mouse macrophages demonstrated enhanced promoter activation of the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Target genes of PPARgamma, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase, NFkappaB and Egr-1, showed reduced activity after telmisartan pretreatment. These data suggest that chronic inhibition of the RAS by telmisartan prevails in reducing advanced atherosclerosis and promoting plaque stability over ramipril, possibly through the reduced activity of the pro-inflammatory transcription factors NFkappaB and Egr-1 and through the activation of PPARgamma.", 
    "772": "There is now increasing evidence that endothelial dysfunction is an early event in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases and can be corrected with certain therapies such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin type I receptor antagonists and stains independently of blood pressure lowering effects. Restoring endothelial function appears to be a crucial target since endothelial dysfunction predicts cardiovascular events in various situations such as coronary artery disease peripheral artery disease, or hypertension and in patients undergoing vascular surgery. Preclinical and clinical data strongly support that endothelin receptor antagonists belong to this restricted class of pharmacological agents able to act on the endothelium, and offer a potential therapeutic approach for numerous diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of this review will be therefore, 1) to propose mechanisms by which ET-1 can cause endothelial dysfunction; 2) to provide an overview of pathological situations associated with endothelial dysfunction related to ET-1; and 3) to assemble evidence on efficacy of endothelin receptor antagonists for improvement of endothelial function.",

The percent events free for ESRD or death at 1 year was 80.1% for group 1 and 77.4% for group 2; 2 years, 69.0% for group 1 and 77.4% group 2; 5 years, 69.0% for group 1 and 57.4% for group 2. The percent events free for death at 1 year was 93.4% in group 1 and 90.9% in group 2; at 2 years, 86.7% for group 1 and 90, 9% for group 2; and at 5 years was 86.7% for group 1 and 67.3% (29.5 to 88.0) for group 2. Sixteen patients (25.4%) developed ESRD or died. Prognosis was not different between the groups for ESRD or death (P = 0.22) or death alone (P = 0.63).", 
    "774": "Late capsular contraction around breast implants is one of the most difficult complications to prevent or resolve. The authors studied the mechanisms that control the fibrotic process in an animal model. Using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonist, the authors previously described a significant reduction in fibrosis in different experimental models.", 
    "775": "Four groups of six rats each had a mini breast implant, 12 with a smooth surface and 12 with a textured surface. In two groups, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was administered in drinking water, ad libitum, to determine its effect on both implant types. Two control groups were given plain drinking water. Three months postoperatively, all of the rats were killed and the capsule sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome. Immunolabeling of collagen III and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 was performed using monoclonal antibodies.", 
    "776": "Significant differences were found between smooth and textured implants, with a uniformly low inflammatory response found on textured implants. For both surfaces, the enalapril-treated group had a significant reduction of the inflammatory process that was especially marked in the textured implants. Immunostaining for collagen III and TGF-beta1 showed a consistent reduction in both fibrous tissue and cytokine mediator.", 
    "777": "Enalapril lowers the expression of fibrotic mediators, TGF-beta1, inflammatory markers, anti-ED1, anti-collagen III monoclonals, and the periprosthetic fibrosis process. The reduction of TGF-beta1 indicates that the probable main cytokine mediator of the fibrotic cascade is attenuated. This hypothesis may provide the basis for a safe and cheap therapeutic strategy with which to modify the capsular contracture that sometimes affects women with mammary implants.", 
    "778": "The aim of this review is to look at the role of aldosterone in the progression of chronic kidney disease. The reduction of blood pressure and proteinuria in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease decreases the rate of disease progression. Suppression of angiotensin formation by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and blockade of the angiotensin II receptor by angiotensin II type 1 antagonists are powerful therapeutic strategies that effectively lower blood pressure and slow the progression of renal disease. These therapies, however, provide only imperfect protection, since they cannot always prevent endstage renal failure.", 
    "779": "Aldosterone plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension and renal disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 antagonists are incomplete in suppressing aldosterone production and 'aldosterone breakthrough' can be observed under continued treatment. Aldosterone blockade reduces blood pressure in virtually all patients with hypertension. In proteinuric patients, the addition of an aldosterone antagonist to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or to angiotensin II type 1 antagonists reduces proteinuria.", 
    "780": "The use of aldosterone antagonists in addition to either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 antagonists in proteinuric patients reduces proteinuria, which may translate into preservation of the glomerular filtration rate in the longer term. Therefore, blockade of the aldosterone pathway may prove to be a beneficial therapy for chronic kidney disease.",

The purpose of this article is to highlight the role of NF-kappaB as an intracellular signaling for angiotensin II and clinical perspectives of targeting NF-kappaB signaling in treating hypertensive and renal diseases.", 
    "782": "A selective review of recently published work provides strong evidence that activation of NF-kappaB signaling by angiotensin II mediates the detrimental effects of angiotensin II on the transcription of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Angiotensin II stimulates AT1 receptors to activate NF-kappaB signaling via both canonical (classical) and noncanonical (alternative) pathways. Intracellular angiotensin II may also induce NF-kappaB activation and transactivation of target genes. Nearly 800 NF-kappaB inhibitors have been described, but none has advanced to clinical trials. However, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 blockers are beneficial in treating angiotensin II-induced hypertensive and renal injury in part by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation.", 
    "783": "Angiotensin II induces the transcription of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, leading to target organ injury. These responses to angiotensin II are caused primarily by AT1 receptor-activated NF-kappaB signaling. Targeting NF-kappaB signaling with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 blockers, and specific NF-kappaB inhibitors may represent a novel approach in treating angiotensin II-induced hypertensive and renal diseases.", 
    "784": "Hypertension is a common chronic disease that leads to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Blood pressure control is critical in reducing the end-organ complications, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or kidney disease. Currently available antihypertensive agents work by different mechanisms to reduce blood pressure. Aliskiren, a novel direct renin inhibitor, lowers blood pressure by decreasing renin activity, and angiotensin I and II levels. At the approved dosage (150-300 mg once daily), it reduces systolic blood pressure by 12-16 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 2-12 mm Hg. In studies its efficacy was comparable to losartan 100 mg, irbesartan 150 mg, and valsartan 80-320 mg. When used adjunctively with ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, it provides additional blood pressure reduction compared with placebo or monotherapy. Aliskiren is well tolerated, with the most common side effects being gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, weakness, and headache. In short-term clinical trials, aliskiren caused fewer disturbances in potassium levels when compared with hydrochlorothiazide, ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Long-term data on morbidity and mortality outcomes are not currently available, thus it is unknown whether aliskiren would join ACE inhibitors and ARBs as the preferred hypertensive agents for end organ protection. At this time, aliskiren should be considered as an alternative agent for mild-to-moderate hypertension, or as an adjunctive therapy when preferred agents fail to maintain optimal blood pressure control. It is also an option for those patients who have contraindications or intolerability to other antihypertensive agents, including dry cough induced by ACE inhibitors.",

We investigated whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor imidapril-induced angiogenesis might be mediated via the tissue bradykinin pathway. To rule out the conventional effects of Ang II on angiogenesis, we used Ang II type 1a receptor knockout (AT1aKO) mice. We examined the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor imidapril on angiogenesis in a hindlimb ischemia model using AT1aKO mice. After induction of hindlimb ischemia, AT1aKO mice were treated with or without imidapril (1.0 or 0.1 mg/kg per day for 21 days). Angiogenesis was quantified by laser Doppler blood flowmetry and capillary density. Angiogenesis was reduced in AT1aKO mice compared with wild-type mice. Imidapril with either low or high doses enhanced angiogenesis in AT1aKO mice (P<0.01). Ang II type 2 receptor antagonist (PD123319; 30 mg/kg per day) and B1 receptor antagonist (DesArg9-[Leu8]-bradykinin; 50 nmol/kg per day) suppressed the imidapril-induced angiogenesis in AT1aKO mice to an extent even lower than that of nontreated AT1aKO mice. B2 receptor antagonist (Hoechst 140; 100 microg/kg/d) and NO synthase inhibitor (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; 20 mg/kg per day) moderately attenuated the imidapril-mediated angiogenesis. RT-PCR revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 mRNA was reduced with PD123319, DesArg9-[Leu8]-bradykinin, or Hoechst 140, and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA abundance was suppressed with PD123319 or DesArg9-[Leu8]-bradykinin. In conclusion, imidapril elicited angiogenesis in the setting of tissue ischemia in AT1aKO mice. This angiogenic effect might involve the Ang II-Ang II type 2 receptor pathway in addition to the bradykinin-B1 and bradykinin-B2 receptor/NO-dependent pathways.",

We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to examine the blood pressure lowering potential of 2 ACE-inhibiting lactotripeptides, ie, Isoleucine-Proline-Proline and Valine-Proline-Proline. We included 135 Dutch subjects with elevated systolic blood pressure who were otherwise healthy and who received no current antihypertensive treatment. After a 2-week run-in period on placebo, subjects randomly received a daily dose of 200 mL dairy drink with 14 mg lactotripeptides obtained by concentrating fermented milk, enzymatic hydrolysis, or chemical synthesis, or placebo for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week wash-out. The primary outcome was 8-week change in office systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes were change in diastolic blood pressure, home blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, plasma ACE-activity, and plasma angiotensin II. Blood pressure at baseline was on average 142/84 mm Hg. Lactotripeptides did not significantly change systolic blood pressure (P=0.46) or diastolic blood pressure (P=0.31) compared with placebo. The mean difference (95%-CI) in systolic blood pressure response between treatment and placebo was 2.8 mm Hg (-2.6;8.2) for concentrated fermented milk lactotripeptides, -0.5 mm Hg (-6.0;5.0) for enzymatic lactotripeptides, and 1.6 mm Hg (-3.9;6.9) for synthetic lactotripeptides.

In conclusion, the present study does not support the hypothesis of a blood pressure lowering effect of the lactotripeptides Isoleucine-Proline-Proline and Valine-Proline-Proline.", 
    "809": "The study of thermal-related solid-state reaction monitored by spectroscopic method needs the use of advanced multivariate chemometric approach. It is because visual inspection of spectral data on particular functional groups or spectral bands is difficult to reveal the complete physical and chemical information. The spectral contributions from various species involved in the solid-state changes are generally highly overlapping and the spectral differences between reactant and product are usually quite minute. In this article, we demonstrate the use of multivariate chemometric approach to resolve the in situ thermal-dependent Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) mixture spectra of lisinopril dihydrate when it was heated from 24 to 170 degrees C. The collected FT-IR mixture spectra were first subjected to singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain the right singular vectors. The right singular vectors were rotated into a set of pure component spectral estimates based on entropy minimization and spectral dissimilarity objective functions. The resulting pure component spectral estimates were then further refined using alternating least squares (ALS). In current study, four pure component spectra, that is, lisinopril dihydrate, monohydrate, anhydrate, and diketopiperazine (DKP) were all resolved and the relative thermal-dependent contributions of each component were also obtained. These relative contributions revealed the critical temperature for each transformation and degradation. This novel approach provides better interpretation of the pathway of dehydration and intramolecular cyclization of lisinopril dihydrate in the solid state. In addition, it can be used to complement the information obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).",

However, the sclerosis scores in the 0.26% (0.59 +/- 0.26) and 1.3% (0.58 +/- 0.16) saireito-mixed feed groups were significantly lower than that in the control group. In the captopril-mixed feed group, the sclerosis score was 0.64 +/- 0.34, significantly lower than that in the control group. It was clarified that saireito suppressed mesangial cell proliferation without showing any cytotoxicity. Furthermore, as a result of investigating the mesangial cell proliferation-suppressing effect similarly with the 23 substances constituting saireito, a proliferation-suppressing effect was recognized with isoliquiritigenin (a component of Glycyrrhizae Radix) and oroxylin A (a component of Scutellariae Radix). Oroxylin A and isoliquiritigenin showed an inhibitory effect on PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of oroxylin A and isoliquiritigenin on tyrosine kinase were found to be specific to the PDGF receptor, and showed no influence on the tyrosine kinase activities of other growth-factor receptors examined.",

AT2R antagonist (PD123319, 1 microM) significantly increased Ang-I-induced contraction of MRA from NT but not from HT mice. In addition, PD123319 significantly increased in vivo blood pressure in response to Ang-I. Luminal incubation with ACE-antibody (50 ng/ml) to block only endothelial ACE function significantly enhanced Ang-I-induced contraction of MRA from NT mice. ACE inhibitor (captopril, 10 microM) completely blocked Ang-I-induced contraction of MRA from both animals and prevented the increased blood pressure.

Lisinopril-mediated hypotension was unchanged with concomitant blockade of NEP or NEP/DPPIV (candoxatril+A-899301). However, hypotension was enhanced upon concomitant blockade of APP and further intensified in the presence of NEP inhibition to values not different from omapatrilat alone.",

These results suggest the effects of omapatrilat are mediated by inhibition of three BMEs, ACE/APP/NEP. However, dual inhibition of ACE/NEP or ACE/NEP/DPPIV elicits no increased risk of angioedema compared to ACE inhibition alone. Thus, novel BME inhibitors must display no activity against APP to avoid angioedema risk due to high prevalence of ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",

Half the animals on each diet were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, from birth. Ren-2 rats fed the omega-3 PUFA deficient diet were significantly more hypertensive than those fed the omega-3 PUFA sufficient diet. Perindopril reduced the blood pressure of both omega-3 PUFA-deficient and omega-3 PUFA-sufficient diet-fed Ren-2 rats. Body weight, body fat and plasma leptin were reduced by perindopril treatment but not affected by omega-3 PUFA supply. Given that the elevated blood pressure of the Ren-2 rat is mediated by ANG II, the data suggest that omega-3 PUFA may reduce hypertension via the renin-angiotensin system.",

Although blood pressure, fasting blood sugar and lipid profiles remained unchanged, serum ADMA concentrations decreased significantly (0.51+/-0.08 to 0.46+/-0.07 micromol/l, p<0.01) and CFVR increased significantly (2.78+/-0.36 to 3.35+/-0.46, p<0.001) after the treatment. Moreover, a strong correlation was observed between the difference of ADMA and that of CFVR (r=-0.80, p<0.001). Temocapril reduced serum ADMA concentrations, improved CFVR beyond its blood pressure lowering effect.

We assessed the usefulness of the combined treatment in the Japanese Coronary Artery Disease (JCAD) Study population. In the JCAD Study, 13,812 patients with angiographically shown narrowing in > or =1 of 3 major coronary arteries were followed up for a mean of 2.7 years. The primary end point of the study was all cardiovascular events. In the present study, baseline covariates possibly influencing the event rate were adjusted between the control and treatment groups. Although there were no statistically significant differences in event rates between patients receiving neither statins nor RAS inhibitors and those receiving either drug, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a 22% decrease (p = 0.0286) in the event rate with combined treatment. In conclusion, statins combined with RAS inhibitors may decrease cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease.",

    "825": "This study used data from VALIANT, a randomized comparison of valsartan, captopril, or both in patients with acute myocardial infarction with HF and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We compared baseline characteristics of 825 patients treated with amiodarone at randomization with 13,875 patients not treated with amiodarone. Using Cox models, we examined the association of amiodarone use with subsequent mortality during consecutive periods after randomization (days 1-16, 17-45, 46-198, and 199-1096).", 
    "826": "Patients treated with amiodarone were older, had higher Killip class, and were more likely to have a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Adjusting for baseline predictors of mortality, we found that amiodarone use was associated with a significant increase in mortality during 3 of the 4 periods: hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI (1.1-2.0), P = .02, for days 1 to 16; 2.1 (1.5-2.9), P < .001, for days 17 to 45; 1.1 (0.83-1.46), P = .51, for days 46 to 198; and 1.4 (1.2-1.6), P < .001, for days 199 to 1096.", 
    "827": "In this study, amiodarone use was associated with excess early and late all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. These observational findings are in contrast to earlier randomized trials of amiodarone and need to be validated prospectively.", 
    "828": "We report a case of decompensated porto-pulmonary hypertension closely associated with the development of intra-portocaval shunt thrombosis. A woman with Laennec's cirrhosis was hospitalized because of severe dyspnea and edema. She underwent surgical portocaval anastomosis ten years ago. Imaging studies showed massive intra-shunt thrombosis, portal hypertension, ascites, pleuro-pericardial effusions and enlargement of right cardiac cavities. Cardiac catheterization allowed to rule out coronary and left-sided heart abnormalities and led to the diagnosis of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension. Antithrombotic treatment with low molecular weight heparin was instituted. The management also included ACE inhibitors, spironolactone, low-salt diet and lactulose. The patient was discharged and three months later we observed the disappearance of edema, ascites and pleuro-pericardial effusions, a marked body weight reduction and improved dyspnea and liver function tests. A possible link between the development of intra-shunt thrombosis and clinical decompensation in our patient was hypothesized. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the increased portal pressure, caused by occlusion of portosystemic shunt, reduces renal plasma flow and increases systemic endothelin-1 concentration. In our patient the disappearance of edematous state and improved dyspnea observed after recanalization of the shunt strongly support this hypothesis.", 
    "829": "Apoptosis plays an important role in pathogenesis of primary and secondary cardiomyopathies. It is proposed that antiapoptotic interventions may constitute an effective strategy for these diseases. Some of the antiapoptotic interventions are \"old wine in a new bottle\" measures already included in the conventional pharmacotherapy. As specific antiapoptotic treatment, caspase inhibitors and anti-TNF-alpha antibody are in early phases of clinical trials in non-cardiac diseases or being contemplated for clinical studies. Non-pharmacotherapies such as cardiac resynchronization and left ventricular assist device also exert cardioprotection partly by antiapoptotic mechanisms. In the field of regenerative medicine, myocardial transplantation of bone marrow-derived stem cells has been performed. Although it is controversial whether it is a true regenerative medicine or the cytokine therapy, antiapoptotic effect of transplanted cells may also have a role in cardioprotection. Moreover, apoptosis may develop despite efforts for cardioprotection in some severe situations of heart failure. Cardiac repair and regeneration by cardiac stem cells may compensate a loss of cardiomyocytes avoiding a deleterious situation. Therefore, protection and/or potentiation of such effects by cardiac stem cells appear to be promising therapeutic strategy in the future. In this review, we discuss about the antiapoptotic interventions for cardiomyopathies in the \"real world\" and the future of clinical cardiology.", 
    "830": "Currently, aldosterone is believed to be involved in the development of cardiovascular injury as a potential cardiovascular risk hormone. However, its exact cellular mechanisms remain obscure. This study was undertaken to examine the effect of aldosterone on superoxide production in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells with possible involvement of the small GTP-binding (G) protein Rac1. The aldosterone levels showed a time-dependent (6-24 h) and dose-dependent (10(-8) to 10(-6) m) increase in superoxide generation, whose effect was abolished by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (eplerenone), Src inhibitor (PP2), and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NAD(P)H] oxidase inhibitor (apocynin). Aldosterone activated NADP(H) oxidase and Rac1, whose effects were abolished by eplerenone. The aldosterone-induced superoxide generation was abolished either by nonselective small G protein inhibitor (Clostridium difficile toxin A) or dominant-negative Rac1. Dominant-negative Rac1 also inhibited aldosterone-induced ACE gene expression. Thus, the present study is the first to demonstrate that aldosterone induces superoxide generation via mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated activation of NAD(P)H-oxidase and Rac1 in endothelial cells, thereby contributing to the development of aldosterone-induced vascular injury.", 
    "831": "The combination of negatively-charged membranes and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) evokes hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) during hemodialysis and bradykinin (BK)-related peptides have been hypothesized as being responsible for these complications. In this study, we tested the effects of neutralizing the membrane electronegativity (zeta potential) of polyacrylonitrile AN69 membranes by coating a polyethyleneimine layer (AN69-ST membranes) over the generation of kinins induced by blood contact with synthetic membranes. We used minidialyzers with AN69 or AN69-ST membranes in an ex vivo model of plasma and we showed that plasma dialysis with AN69 membranes led to significant BK and des-Arg(9)-BK release, which was potentiated by ACEi. This kinin formation was dramatically decreased by AN69-ST membranes, even in the presence of an ACEi, and kinin recovery in the dialysates was also significantly lower with these membranes. High molecular weight kininogen and factor XII detection by immunoblotting of the protein layer coating both membranes corroborated the results: binding of these proteins and contact system activation on AN69-ST membranes were reduced. This ex vivo experimental model applied to the plasma, dialysate and dialysis membrane could be used for the characterization of the kinin-forming capacity of any biomaterial potentially used in vivo in combination with drugs which modulate the pharmacological activity of kinins.", 
    "832": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and local activation of the renin-angiotensin system may contribute to insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the involvement of these mediators in the liver. We found that the gene expression of renin-angiotensin system components, together with that of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, is upregulated in the liver of patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. We next examined the role of the renin-angiotensin system on TNF-alpha-induced PAI-1 production in the nonmalignant human hepatocyte cell line THLE-5b. THLE-5b cells expressed genes encoding renin-angiotensin system components including angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor. ACE, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin AT(1) receptor mRNA expression were upregulated time-dependently by TNF-alpha. Moreover, angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha-induced PAI-1 production. Interestingly, high-dose olmesartan, but not candesartan, reduced the increased expression of the angiotensin AT(1) receptor. These results suggest that TNF-alpha and the local renin-angiotensin system coordinately stimulate PAI-1 production in hepatocytes. Selective angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists inhibit both TNF-alpha- and angiotensin II-induced PAI-1 production in hepatocytes, suggesting a cross talk between both systems.", 
    "833": "Screening of a metalloprotease library led to the identification of a thiol-based dual ACE/NEP inhibitor as a potent ACE2 inhibitor. Modifications of the P(1) benzyl moiety led to improvements in ACE2 potency as well as to increased selectivity versus ACE and NEP.",

Adults with hypertension treated with diuretic or beta-blocker monotherapy between 1998 and 2001 were identified from a large US electronic medical records database of primary care practices. Patients were required to have a baseline blood pressure (BP) > or =140/90 mmHg (> or =130/80 mmHg for diabetes mellitus) and recorded BP measurements within 6 months before and 1-12 months following index date. Patients were matched 1:1:1 by propensity score to correct for differences in baseline characteristics. 1875 patients met study criteria and 660 (220 in each cohort) were matched based on propensity scores. Matched cohorts had no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Mean changes in systolic/diastolic BP were -17.5/-8.8, -15.7/-6.3, and -13.0/-8.0 mmHg with DHPs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs, respectively. Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High BP 6/7 goal attainment for each regimen was 47.3%, 40.0%, and 32.2%, respectively. DHPs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs improved BP when added to patients' beta-blocker or diuretic therapy. The greatest benefits were observed with DHPs, followed by ACE inhibitors, then ARBs.",

The course emphasizes integration of previous content, critical thinking, and therapeutic relevance. The content and learning experiences are organized to transition the students' thinking through a constructive process that provides ample opportunities to recall and integrate previous knowledge, learn and apply new knowledge, establish a logical connection between the science and its therapeutic relevance, and finally to apply the science knowledge to predict clinical activity and clinical outcomes as can be expected in a patient.

    "836": "Randomized clinical trials on progression of renal diseases usually include patients according to criteria for BP, renal function, and proteinuria. There are no data showing that this provides groups with similar baseline rates of renal function loss. Accordingly, the impact of preintervention rate of renal function loss (slope) on outcome of studies has not been established.", 
    "837": "Preintervention slope was established in 60 of 89 renal patients without diabetes in whom a 4-yr prospective, randomized intervention had been performed (enalapril versus atenolol), and whether (1) preintervention slope was distributed equally over the groups; (2) treatment benefit, defined as slope improvement, corresponded to study outcome; and (3) preintervention slope was a determinant of intervention slope were analyzed.", 
    "838": "The preintervention slope was different in the groups: -3.7 +/- 3.2 in the group to receive enalapril versus -2.2 +/- 3.3 ml/min per yr in the group to receive atenolol. The intervention slopes were similar: -1.9 +/- 0.8 enalapril and -1.8 +/- 0.7 ml/min per yr atenolol. Accordingly, slope improved during enalapril only. When analyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (I/D) genotype, slope improvement was found only in DD genotype. On multivariate analysis, the preintervention slope was a main predictor of the intervention slope.", 
    "839": "Differences in preintervention slope are relevant to outcome of trials and can induce bias. For future studies, allocation according to preintervention slope, although time-consuming, may be useful to allow conduction of more valid studies in a smaller number of patients.", 
    "840": "Economic analyses of drug therapies are highly dependent on the clinical indications for treatment. The cost effectiveness of ramipril has been evaluated in numerous studies, usually based on the results of one specific clinical trial. We estimated the cost effectiveness of this drug across a range of currently accepted therapeutic indications, using a single health economic model and adjusted for quality of life, to compare the different outcomes observed in four clinical trials.", 
    "841": "The cardiovascular life expectancy model, a validated Markov model, was calibrated to accurately forecast the results of four trials including AIRE, HOPE, Micro-HOPE, and REIN. We then extrapolated these results over the remaining life expectancy of the patients enrolled in each study and adjusted for the quality of life associated with the observed outcomes. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was then calculated from the perspective of the Canadian healthcare system incorporating the estimated direct healthcare costs associated with treatments and outcomes.", 
    "842": "After discounting all costs and outcomes 3% annually, the benefits associated with ramipril ranged from 0.74 QALYs in the AIRE study to 1.22 QALYs in Micro-HOPE. Treatment was estimated to be cost-saving for some patient groups, such as those in REIN. The highest cost-effectiveness ratio was observed among individuals enrolled in HOPE ($Can20 000 per QALY in 2002).", 
    "843": "Treatment with ramipril appears to be economically attractive across a wide range of patient groups, including those with increased coronary risk and/or diabetes mellitus (HOPE and Micro-HOPE), those with congestive heart failure (AIRE), and those with non-diabetic nephropathy (REIN).", 
    "844": "Hypertension is a multifactorial disorder leading to pathophysiologic changes in target organs over time through diverse mechanisms. In addition, hypertension frequently resists control with monotherapy, necessitating combination therapy with two or more antihypertensive agents. Many currently available fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations combine drugs with different, but complementary, mechanisms of action to improve overall efficacy and tolerability. In addition, it is possible to select drug combinations whereby one drug offsets the negative effects of the other drug. Fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations may provide significant advantages over high-dose monotherapy, such as improved BP-lowering efficacy, reduced adverse event frequency, improved patient compliance, potentially lower treatment costs, and shorter time to BP control. Combination therapy has been recommended as potential first-line therapy in recent consensus guideline statements, especially for higher-risk patients, such as those with stage 2 hypertension. The combination of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-targeting agent, such as an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB), and a diuretic or calcium channel antagonist appears to provide synergy with regard to BP lowering. In addition, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have demonstrated beneficial effects beyond BP reduction, reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, inhibiting development and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the progression of renal disease. Preliminary studies of fixed-dose combinations have shown reductions in left ventricular hypertrophy and improvements in markers of renal function. Additional studies currently underway will compare the effects of available fixed-dose combinations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and markers of renal dysfunction.", 
    "845": "Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) has been reported to exhibit an antihypertensive effect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is also an antihypertensive agent. We evaluated the interaction between ALA-enriched oil (test oil) and ACEI concerning the decrease in blood pressure by administering test oil, ACEI, or test oil + ACEI to 7-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). After administration, the systolic pressure decreased significantly in all groups compared with the level before administration, but the diastolic pressure decreased significantly only in the test oil + ACEI group. No significant difference was noted in systolic or diastolic pressure among the 3 groups. These results suggest that the interaction between ALA-enriched oil and ACEI is limited. Our study suggested the safety of consuming foods containing a large amount of ALA in combination with hypotensive agents.", 
    "846": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem that has received increasing attention because of the high rate of associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Mounting evidence indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) safely slow down progression of CKD. There is also growing evidence supporting combination treatment of nephropathies with an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB to more completely block the RAAS and provide greater renoprotection than either an ACE inhibitor-based or ARB-based regimen. The National Kidney Foundation suggests that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be used in combination to reduce proteinuria in patients with kidney disease; however, larger outcomes trials are needed.", 
    "847": "Angioedema (AE) is a problem that all doctors inclusive of emergency room physicians and the otolaryngologists are often asked to treat. We present a six-year experience with this disorder. In this series, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) were related to 60% of admissions for angioedema. Lip and tongue swelling was the most common manifestation. The discontinuation of ACEI therapy and supportive management are the recommended approaches to treatment and prevention of unfavourable outcomes. The authors strongly recommend medic alert bracelets for all patients with this disorder. The use and side effects of ACEI therapy in our population which is predominantly of African descent warrants further investigations.",

    "849": "The Ischemia Management with Accupril post-bypass Graft via Inhibition of the coNverting Enzyme (IMAGINE) trial tested whether early initiation (< or = 7 days) of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor after CABG reduced cardiovascular events in stable patients with left ventricular ejection fraction > or = 40%. The trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 2553 patients randomly assigned to quinapril, target dose 40 mg/d, or placebo, who were followed up to a maximum of 43 months. The mean (SD) age was 61 (10) years. The incidence of the primary composite end point (cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, unstable angina or heart failure requiring hospitalization, documented angina, and stroke) was 13.7% in the quinapril group and 12.2% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.42, P=0.212) over a median follow-up of 2.95 years. The incidence of the primary composite end point increased significantly in the first 3 months after CABG in the quinapril group (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.26, P=0.0356). Adverse events also increased in the quinapril group, particularly during the first 3 months after CABG.", 
    "850": "In patients at low risk of cardiovascular events after CABG, routine early initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy does not appear to improve clinical outcome up to 3 years after CABG; however, it increases the incidence of adverse events, particularly early after CABG. Thus, early after CABG, initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy should be individualized and continually reassessed over time according to risk.", 
    "851": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a regulatory protein of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and a receptor for the causative agent of severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the SARS-coronavirus. We have previously shown that ACE2 can be shed from the cell surface in response to phorbol esters by a process involving TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE; ADAM17). In this study, we demonstrate that inhibitors of calmodulin also stimulate shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain, a process at least partially mediated by a metalloproteinase. We also show that calmodulin associates with ACE2 and that this interaction is decreased by calmodulin inhibitors.", 
    "852": "Atrial fibrillation (AFb) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Once initiated, AFb alters atrial electrical and structural properties (remodeling) that promotes its maintenance and recurrence. Treatment is directed to restore and maintain the sinus rhythm, to control the ventricular rate and to prevent thromboembolic complications. Recent evidence indicates that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists and statins modify atrial remodeling and reduce the incidence of AFb, thus possibly representing a new alternative in the treatment of the arrhythmia.", 
    "853": "The controlled ADVANCE trial compared the incidence of major macrovascular and microvascular complications in 5,569 type 2 diabetic patients randomised to a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide and in 5,571 patients randomised to placebo, followed for a mean duration of 4.3 years. Compared with patients assigned placebo, those assigned active therapy had a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 5.6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 2.2 mm Hg, despite the fact physicians were allowed to adjust antihypertensive therapy ad libitum. The relative risk of a major macrovascular and microvascular event (primary endpoint) was reduced by 9% (p = 0.041) in the active group. The separate reductions in macrovascular and microvascular events were similar but were not independently statistically significant. The relative risk of death was significantly reduced by 14% (p = 0.025), essentially due to a lower death rate from cardiovascular diseases (-18%; p = 0.027). The incidence of any coronary event was also significantly reduced (-14 %; p = 0.020), while only a trend was observed for all cerebrovascular events. Finally, renal events were significantly less frequent (-21%; p < 0.0001) whereas all ocular events were only slightly reduced (-5%; NS) in the active group as compared to the placebo group. The fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide was well tolerated and easy to administer. Overall one death due to any cause would be averted among every 79 diabetic patients assigned active therapy for 5 years. There was no evidence that the effects of the study treatment differed by initial blood pressure level or concomitant use of other treatments at baseline.",

Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed at 4.4 (+/-0.4) years in 52 clinically stable long-term survivors of the index AMI. We assessed the relationships of plasma N-BNP, MMP-2, and MMP-9 with myocardial scarring, and measures of long-term LV remodeling. Compared with a reference population, N-BNP and MMP-9 levels were increased at all time points from the acute phase until > 4 years after MI. Plasma N-BNP and MMP-9 correlated only in the subacute phase (randomization, mean 3.3 days after MI) days after acute MI (r = 0.38, P = .006). At CMR assessment > or = 4 years, log MMP-9 level was inversely related to LV ejection fraction (P = .002) and nonscarred myocardial mass (P = .008). This relationship was independent of MMP-2. Log N-BNP was related to end diastolic volume index (P = .0002). There was no correlation between log MMP-9 and LV volumes.", 
    "856": "There is a time-dependent relationship between plasma N-BNP and MMP-9 levels, these peptides correlating only in the acute phase after MI. In long-term follow-up, plasma MMP-9 and N-BNP levels were related to different parameters of LV remodeling. These findings suggest that in long-term survivors of complicated MI, different mechanisms modulate plasma levels of MMP-9 and N-BNP.",

After exclusion of patients with preoperative BG >120 mg/dL and with missing preoperative BG data, 163 cases were included in the final analysis. Patients with BG > or =200 mg/dL during CPB and remaining > or =200 mg/dL either during or after CPB or at the first postoperative measurement formed the study group (n = 35). One case had insufficient data to determine group assignment and was not used in comparison. The remaining patients formed the control group (n = 127).",

The CCB group compared to non-CCBs displayed a higher mean Cr (as well as a higher rate of increase) and proteinuria.

From Austrian sickness funds claims, we identified all acute MI patients who were discharged within 30 days and who survived >or=120 days after MI in 2004. We ascertained outpatient use of ACEI/ARBs, BBs, statins, and aspirin from all filled prescriptions between discharge and 120 days post MI. Comorbidities were ascertained from use of indicator drugs during the preceding year. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent determinants of study drug use. We evaluated 4,105 MI patients, whose mean age was 68.8 (+/-13.2) years; 59.5% were men. Within 120 days after MI, 67% filled prescriptions for ACE/ARBs, 74% for BBs, and 67% for statin. While 41% received all these classes and 34% two, 25% of patients received only one or none of these drugs. Older age and presence of severe mental illness were associated with lower use of all drug classes. Diabetics had greater ACEI/ARB use. Fewer BBs were used in patients with obstructive lung disease. Statin use was lower in patients using treatment for congestive heart failure (all P<0.001). We conclude that recommended medications were underused in Austrian MI survivors.

We then collected data on blood pressure and medication use in patients seen by these physicians from the health center's information system. We compared the physicians' perceived hypertension control rates with the actual rates, and then evaluated the rate of high overestimation (overestimation by more than 25% of the median degree of hypertension control rate overestimation) among the physicians. The physicians' antihypertensive prescription patterns were also evaluated. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent association between hypertension control and physician-related factors.",

The percentage of physicians with high overestimation was 35.5% (11 physicians). The physicians with lower control rates were more likely to highly overestimate their patients' control rates. Physicians with below-median actual control rates tended to prescribe fewer combination treatments for patients with uncontrolled blood pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or fewer angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with diabetes mellitus. The rate of high overestimation by physicians was 1.31 times higher in patients with uncontrolled blood pressure than in patients with other conditions (OR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.17-1.48).", 
    "870": "Physicians have a tendency to overestimate the rates of hypertension control in their patients. Because physicians have a direct role in treatment outcomes, physicians' overestimation about hypertension management contributes to inadequate blood pressure control. Thus, interventions for improving physician' awareness regarding the management of patients with hypertension are needed.", 
    "871": "An important endpoint in treating chronic kidney disease, a prevalent disease that can lead to kidney failure and cardiovascular disease, is reducing proteinuria. Proteinuria is an independent risk factor for disease progression and the development of cardiovascular disease and is a key factor that can be used to guide therapy designed to maximize kidney protection. Proteinuria is targeted by using pharmacologic agents that suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a regulator of intravascular volume and blood pressure; this has been shown to decrease proteinuria, slow disease progression, and improve coronary disease outcome, independent of effects on blood pressure. The efficacy of RAAS blockers, including angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may be limited by currently recommended doses, which are based on treatment of hypertension. Data are now emerging from clinical trials demonstrating that use of 'supratherapeutic doses' (doses greater than those approved for lowering blood pressure), compared with standard doses, has favorable safety, tolerability, and efficacy in reducing proteinuria in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients with chronic kidney disease. Supratherapeutic dosing may be a valuable approach for optimizing RAAS blockade and providing renoprotection.", 
    "872": "The historical choice of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition as first-line therapy in heart failure is challenged by early activation of the sympathetic system and multiple ways beta blockade (in particular, unselective agents such as carvedilol) may affect cardiac remodeling, its underlying mechanisms, and, hence, progression of heart failure, compared with ACE inhibition. Existing comparisons indicate similar or possible greater efficacy of beta blockade than ACE inhibition. As beta blockade is well tolerated, it could be considered in individual stable patients. However, early combined treatment with both neurohormonal antagonists remains preferable to either neurohormonal antagonist alone and should not be delayed.", 
    "873": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Thus, strategies for the treatment of heart failure have focused on agents that block the RAS.

This article examines the rationale and role of ARBs in the treatment of patients with heart failure on the basis of evidence from clinical trials.",

This study evaluates a combined BNP and clinical algorithm for detecting cardiac dysfunction and the risk of death, in patients receiving cardioactive medication.", 
    "876": "459 stable general practice patients, who were taking typical heart failure drugs for any indication, were included. Echocardiography, ECG, and assay of NT-proANP and BNP (two methods) were performed. Regression models were used to identify items in a Risk Score to detect cardiac dysfunction.",

    "879": "Diabetic nephropathy is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis and natural history of diabetic nephropathy, characterised by a progressive decline in glomerular function, were initially described in patients with type 1 diabetes. Reports that describe the glomerulopathy and progression of renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that the disease process is similar to that observed in patients with type 1 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy. An emerging body of evidence supports the notion that glomerular capillary wall and mesangial alterations in diabetic nephropathy involve pathobiochemical alterations of glycoproteins in these structures. Evidence in experimental animals rendered diabetic, reveal that the administration of heparin and other anionic glycoproteins can effectively prevent the biochemical alterations that promote albuminuria. Clinical reports of the use of sulodexide, a preparation of low molecular weight glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides, have shown that proteinuria is significantly diminished in patients with diabetic nephropathy, even when these patients are receiving either an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor antagonist.", 
    "880": "The metabolic syndrome (MS), a cluster of risk factors, such as obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia, contributes to the development of cardio-vascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Insulin resistance (IR) plays a key role in MS being strongly linked to abdominal visceral fat. Treatment for obese patients with MS should aim at improving IR, delaying the onset of DM2 and at reducing cardio-vascular risk. Weight loss, first therapeutic target, may be obtained through life-style modifications and anti-obesity drugs or bariatric surgery, at need. In these patients drug therapy is necessary if therapeutic life-style changes are not sufficient. Some drugs have adverse metabolic effects, therefore the therapeutic choices must be specific and rational. Metformin, Thiazolidinediones and Acarbose are anti-hyperglycemic drugs of choice: they reduce the incidence of DM2 and IR (or improve insulin sensitivity) and they decrease or stabilize the visceral adipose tissue mass (Thiazolidinediones increases subcutaneous fat only). Also Angiotensin II receptor blockers and Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce the incidence of DM2 and insulin resistance and they are first-line antihypertensive drugs in MS. Calcium channel blockers, Alpha-1 antagonists and Alpha-2 agonists drugs are metabolically neutral and slight weight gains are related to the hydro-sodium retention. Beta-blockers and Diuretics, except for Indapamide and Anti-aldosterone drugs, can reduce insulin sensitivity, impair lipid profile and increase DM2 incidence; they are not first-line therapy yet they are necessary in selected cases only. Statins, Fibrates and omega-3 Fatty acids are indicated to normalize dyslipidemia. Low doses of acetylsalicylic acid are also recommended.", 
    "881": "History of angioedema is a contraindication for ACE-inhibitors. Angioedema is caused by: 1. a decreased degradation of bradykinin, 2. a defect in C 1-esterase-inhibitor with the increased generation of bradykinin or 3. other trigger mechanisms as food, pollen and stress. AT1 receptor antagonists do not inhibit the degradation of bradykinin. Thus angioedema is no contraindication for AT1 receptor antagonists. In patients with an anamnestic angioedema or ACE-induced angioedema AT1 receptor antagonists can be given under close monitoring provided that there is strong indication for inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.",

Progression/regression of CAC was defined as a change > or =2.5 between the square root transformed values of baseline and follow-up volumetric CAC scores.

    "887": "Neuroendocrine activation in heart failure has become the major target of pharmacotherapy for this growing epidemic. Agents targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems have shown cardiovascular and survival benefits in clinical trials. Beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors remain the mainstream initial therapy. The benefits of aldosterone antagonists have been demonstrated in advanced heart failure (spironolactone) and after myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (eplerenone). Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that angiotensin receptor blockers may be a reasonable alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure (candesartan) and following myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction (valsartan). Angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan) also provided incremental benefits when added to ACE inhibitors in chronic heart failure. Thus, combining neuroendocrine inhibitors in heart failure appears both biologically plausible and evidence-based. However, this approach raised concerns about side effects, such as hypotension, renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, and others. Close follow-up and implementation of evidence-based medicine (ie, using agents and doses proven beneficial in clinical trials) should therefore be undertaken when combining neuroendocrine inhibitors.", 
    "888": "Current evidence implicates a prothrombotic state in the development of Shiga-toxin (Stx)-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). We recently reported that Stx modulates procoagulant activity by enhancing functional tissue factor (TF) activity on cytokine-activated human glomerular endothelial cells (HGECs). Since angiotensin II (Ang II), the key effector of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), has been shown to increase TF expression in vascular tissue, we examined the possible involvement of Ang II in TF expression in HGECs. HGECs were exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha +/- Stx-1 +/- Ang II. Exogenous Ang II significantly increased TF activity and TF mRNA in TNF-alpha- +/- Stx-1-activated HGECs. This increase was mediated via Ang II type I receptor (AT(1)R), as losartan, an AT(1)R inhibitor, attenuated Ang-II-induced TF activity. To study the effect of endogenous Ang II in TF expression by TNF-alpha +/- Stx-1, HGECs were incubated with losartan or an AT(2)R inhibitor (PD 123319) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). Losartan but not PD 123319 decreased TF activity induced by TNF-alpha +/- Stx-1 (P < 0.05). Enalapril, also, dose dependently, downregulated TF expression in HGECs exposed to TNF-alpha +/- Stx-1 (P < 0.05). AT(1)R mRNA was upregulated in TNF-alpha- +/- Stx-1-activated HGECs (P < 0.05). These data indicate that TF expression in TNF-alpha- and Stx-1-activated HGECs is enhanced by exogenous Ang II and that endogenous Ang II production may be upregulated by TNF-alpha +/- Stx-1. Hence, local RAS activation may be important in the development of the thrombotic microangiopathy observed in HUS.",

We have previously reported that mice overexpressing angiotensinogen in renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC) develop hypertension, albuminuria, and renal injury. Here, we investigated whether activation of the intrarenal RAS contributes to apoptosis of RPTC in diabetes. Induction of diabetes with streptozotocin in these transgenic mice led to significant increases in BP, albuminuria, RPTC apoptosis, and proapoptotic gene expression compared with diabetic nontransgenic littermates. Insulin and/or RAS blockers markedly attenuated these changes. Hydralazine prevented hypertension but not albuminuria, RPTC apoptosis, or proapoptotic gene expression. In vitro, high-glucose medium significantly increased apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in rat immortalized RPTC overexpressing angiotensinogen compared with control cells, and these changes were prevented by insulin and/or RAS blockers. In conclusion, intrarenal RAS activation and high glucose may act in concert to increase tubular apoptosis in diabetes, independent of systemic hypertension.",

As any new treatment is likely to be used in conjunction with standard ACEI (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) therapy, it is important that the combined effects of these agents are assessed. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Ucn2 and an ACEI (captopril) administered for 3 h, both separately and together, in eight sheep with pacing-induced heart failure. Ucn2 and captopril alone both increased CO (cardiac output; Ucn2>captopril) and decreased arterial pressure (captopril>Ucn2), left atrial pressure (Ucn2>captopril) and peripheral resistance (Ucn2=captopril) relative to controls. Compared with either treatment alone, combined treatment further improved CO and reduced peripheral resistance and cardiac preload, without inducing further falls in blood pressure. In contrast with the marked increase in plasma renin activity observed with captopril alone, Ucn2 administration reduced renin activity, whereas the combined agents resulted in intermediate renin levels. All active treatments decreased circulating levels of aldosterone (Ucn2+captopril>Ucn2=captopril), endothelin-1 and the natriuretic peptides (Ucn2+captopril=Ucn2>captopril), whereas adrenaline (epinephrine) fell only with Ucn2 (Ucn2+captopril=Ucn2), and vasopressin increased during captopril alone. Ucn2, both separately and in conjunction with captopril, increased urine output, sodium and creatinine excretion and creatinine clearance. Conversely, captopril administered alone adversely affected these renal indices. In conclusion, co-treatment with Ucn2 and an ACEI in heart failure produced significantly greater improvements in haemodynamics, hormonal profile and renal function than achieved by captopril alone. These results indicate that dual treatment with these two agents is beneficial.",

Twenty patients were included: Age 37.45 +/- 13.26 years (50% male); 7 patients (35%) were hypertensive; proteinuria 2.2 +/- 1.86 g/day; serum creatinine 1.07 +/- 0.29 mg/dl; mean follow-up 60.10 +/- 31.47 months. IgA nephropathy was subclassified according to Haas criteria. Twelve patients (60%) were class II; seven (35%) were class III and one (5%) class V. All patients received dual renin-angiotensin system blockade as tolerated. Oral methylprednisone was started at 0.5 mg/kg/day for the initial 8 weeks and subsequently tapered bi-weekly until the maintenance dose of 4 mg was reached. Oral steroids were discontinued after 24 weeks (6 months) of therapy but renin-angiotensin inhibition remained unchanged. At 10 weeks of therapy proteinuria decreased to 0.15 +/- 0.07 g/day (P < 0.001) while serum creatinine did not vary: 1.07 +/- 0.28 mg/dl (P = ns). After a mean follow-up of 42.36 +/- 21.56 months urinary protein excretion (0.12 +/- 0.06 g/day) and renal function (serum creatinine 1.06 +/- 0.27 mg/dl) remained stable. No major side effects were reported during the study. Renin-angiotensin blockade plus oral steroids proved useful to significantly decrease proteinuria to < 0.5 g/day in patients with IgA nephropathy without changes in renal function.", 
    "922": "His-His-Leu (HHL), a tripeptide derived from a Korean soybean paste, is an angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. We report here a method of producing this tripeptide efficiently by expressing tandem multimers of the codons encoding the peptide in E. coli and purifying the HHL after hydrolysis of the peptide multiners. The HHL gene, tandemly multimerized to a 40-mer, was ligated with ubiquitin as a fusion gene (UH40). UH40 was inserted into vector pET29b; the UH40 fusion protein was then produced in E. coli BL21. The recombinant UH40 protein was purified by cation-exchange chromatography with a yield of 17.3 mg/l and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry and protein N-terminal sequencing. Leucine aminopeptidase was used to cleave a 405-Da HHL monomer from the UH40 fusion protein and the peptide was purified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 HPLC column, with a final yield of 6.2 mg/l. The resulting peptide was confirmed to be HHL with the aid of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, glutamine-TOF mass spectrometry, N-terminal sequencing, and measurement of ACE inhibiting activity. These results suggest that our production method is useful for obtaining a large quantity of recombinant HHL for functional antihypertensive peptide studies.", 
    "923": "Blood pressure reduction represents a key priority for any preventive strategy in hypertension. However, one of the issues that has been raised repeatedly over the last few years is whether blood pressure reduction is all that matters in the treatment of hypertension, or if other properties related to antihypertensive drugs may be relevant for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. In this view, a long debate has emerged in the scientific and medical community, whether the newer classes of antihypertensive agents have additional properties beyond blood pressure control and, further, are superior to traditional antihypertensive drugs. The evidence accumulated over the last 20 years have consistently demonstrated that \"new\" drugs are as effective as \"old\" drugs in terms of blood pressure-lowering effect and in several clinical trials even more effective than old drugs on major cardiovascular outcomes. In addition, they have been demonstrated to effectively antagonize the progression of the hypertensive disease, as monitored through the development of intermediate end points. Finally, in view of the need for using combination therapy to effectively achieve blood pressure control in the clinical management of hypertension, the antihypertensive combinations based on new drugs, especially those using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers with a low-dose thiazide diuretic or those using calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors, are now considered more effective and safer than those using beta-blockers and low-dose thiazide diuretic, especially in view of their better metabolic profile and their better tolerability.", 
    "924": "The blood pressure (BP) goals set by hypertension management guidelines (<140/90 mm Hg in uncomplicated hypertension; <130/80 mm Hg in type 2 diabetes or kidney disease) are not being achieved in a high proportion of patients, partly because monotherapy is insufficient in many patients. In particular, patients with uncontrolled moderate or severe hypertension and/or associated cardiovascular risk factors remain at high risk for cardiovascular events and hypertensive emergency. In recognition of the urgency of treating moderate and severe hypertension, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) advocates the initial use of 2-drug therapies in patients with systolic BP levels >20 mm Hg above goal or diastolic BP level >10 mm Hg above goal. Regimens should usually include a thiazide diuretic and, for patients with diabetes or kidney disease, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Recently, clinical trial data have shown that first-step antihypertensive treatment of moderate and severe hypertension with carefully chosen fixed-dose combinations provides a high rate of BP goal achievement, a simplified dosing regimen, and superior tolerability compared with monotherapy.", 
    "925": "The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and furosemide on zinc metabolism by assessing serum zinc and urine levels in hospitalized subjects. We recruited 11 patients with heart failure from the Internal Medicine Department; these patients had been hospitalized less than 72 h before. Heart failure was defined using clinical and radiological signs. Serum zinc concentrations were measured using an air/acetylene flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Urine zinc levels were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Data were obtained from the 11 patients and 24 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Results indicate higher urine zinc levels and lower concentrations of zinc in serum in heart failure patients vs matched controls (p<0.05). This study suggests that treating heart failure patients with ACE inhibitors may result in zinc deficiency.", 
    "926": "Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most frequent causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and there has been a dramatic increase in the number of patients entering renal replacement therapy in the last few years. Moreover, diabetic nephropathy is associated with elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy is based on optimal metabolic and blood pressure control, proteinuria reduction, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition. In the normoalbuminuric patient, optimal glycemic control (HbA1c below 7.0%) plays a fundamental role in the primary prevention of ESRD. Furthermore, blood pressure levels below 130/80 mmHg are strongly recommended. In the microalbuminuric stage, strict glycemic control (HbA1c below 7.0%) likely reduces the incidence of overt nephropathy, while blood pressure values less than 130/80 mmHg are recommended. Moreover, there is evidence that inhibition of RAAS, either by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), reduces the development of overt nephropathy, regardless of the blood pressure levels. ACE-I are recommended as the drugs of choice in type 1 diabetes, while both ACE-I and ARB are considered first-choice drugs in type 2 diabetes. Once overt proteinuria has developed, it is uncertain whether glycemic control affects the progression of nephropathy, which is strongly influenced by blood pressure and proteinuria. Optimal blood pressure levels are < 130/80 mmHg in patients with proteinuria < 1 g/day and < 120/75 mmHg in patients with proteinuria > or =1 g/day. In type 1 diabetes there is consensus on the renoprotective role of ACE-I, while in type 2 diabetes, ARB have been shown to be more effective than conventional therapy or calcium-channel blockers in slowing the progression of nephropathy. Lastly, a multifactorial therapeutic approach based on optimal glycemic control, intensive antihypertensive therapy, inhibition of RAAS, statins and aspirin is pivotal in the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "927": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for approximately one-third of all deaths in patients with heart failure, and is generally the result of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or ventricular fibrillation (VF). The mechanisms of VT/VF associated with heart failure are complex and heterogeneous; they include functional and structural remodeling, as well as neurohormonal activation. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is very useful for preventing SCD, but the improvement of outcome is limited in patients with cardiac dysfunction and advanced heart failure. This article reviews the current status of drug therapy for the treatment of VT/VF in patients with heart failure. Chronic beta-blocker therapy reduces SCD and improves survival. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists are thought to reduce SCD by preventing ventricular remodeling. Amiodarone is potentially effective for preventing VT/VF in patients at high risk, especially those with nonischemic heart failure. This may be a result of the complex pharmacodynamics of amiodarone, which affects many kinds of ion channels/transporters, as well as thyroid function. The pure class III antiarrhythmic drug, nifekalant, is useful in the emergency treatment of VT/VF.", 
    "928": "There are multiple factors for the etiology of atrial fibrillation (AF), including stretch, autonomic imbalance, hyperthyroidism, and inflammation. Of these factors for AF, stretch and inflammation increase the angiotensin II level, thereby inducing calcium over load, and inducing ectopic focal activities that initiate AF. Angiotensin II activates the Erk cascade through the AT(1)R and induces interstitial fibrosis of the atria, which compromises intra-atrial conduction. Short atrial refractoriness and slow conduction form multiple re-entry, before maintaining AF. Anti-arrhythmic drugs used for downstream therapy can suppress the focal activities and re-entry, but cannot prevent the development of a structural substrate. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker and statins might constitute upstream therapy through the prevention of structural remodeling that promotes AF.",

The average (SD) baseline blood pressure of 145(22)/81 (11) mmHg fell by 8/3 mmHg during the run-in phase during which participants received one tablet of open-labelled perindopril 2 mg-indapamide 0.625 mg. Only 3.6% of the 12 878 patients who entered the run-in phase withdrew because of suspected intolerance to perindopril-indapamide.

It is anticipated that ADVANCE will provide many new insights including: whether blood pressure lowering with perindopril-indapamide reduces the risk of both macrovascular and microvascular events irrespective of baseline blood pressure; whether more intensive blood pressure lowering with a gliclazide-MR-based regimen targeting on HbA1c levels of 6.5% or less reduces these two outcomes compared with standard guidelines therapy; and finally whether the separate benefits of these two treatment regimens are additive.", 
    "933": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus occur together frequently. There is general consensus in the literature that in patients with hypertension and diabetes, the heart and kidneys are locked in a vice, between arterial stiffening and damage to the microcirculation, with each condition feeding the other in a vicious cycle of events. Decreased glucose tolerance is associated with increased thickness and stiffness of large blood vessels, which contributes to increased blood pressure, macrovascular complications and impaired renal function. Large artery stiffness causes damage to the microvasculature, which in turn increases both capillary rarefaction, initially generated by hypertension and diabetes, and wave reflection. Systolic and pulse pressure are consequently increased, which results in completion of the cycle with more microvascular damage. In addition, macro and microvascular damage appears to increase blood pressure and impair tissue perfusion to target organs, and alterations to the vascular structure of peripheral microvessels in hypertension are related to the impairment of coronary vasodilator capacity. These mechanisms are supported by a large body of data from studies investigating the effects of diabetes and hypertension on the morphology and function of the microvasculature, some of which appear to occur in impaired glucose metabolism, preceding the development of full-blown diabetes. These changes also have important prognostic value, with direct correlations between coronary artery vasoconstriction and the incidence of cardiovascular events. Interventions to break the cycle of events are available, and regimens containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have demonstrated good efficacy in increasing coronary reserve. Some of the mechanisms appear to be centred around the inhibition of bradykinin degradation rather than an effect on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.",

Twenty-two percent of the patients receiving drug therapy were prescribed drug combinations that are potentially harmful. The most common potentially harmful drug combination was an ACE inhibitor with a potassium supplement (33.9% of all combinations). In the multivariate analysis, age and number of drugs are significantly associated with potential DDIs (r = 0.8629). One quarter of elderly patients received a drug potentially inappropriate considering their age. The most commonly prescribed potentially inappropriate drug was amiodarone, followed by diazepam.", 
    "937": "Polypharmacy and older age have been proven to be important risk factors for potential drug interactions.

    "938": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are frequently used for the treatment for glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy because of their albuminuria- or proteinuria-reducing effects. To many patients who are nonresponsive to monotherapy with these agents, combination therapy appears to be a good treatment option. In the present study, we examined the effects of the addition of an ARB (losartan) followed by titration upon addition and at 3 and 6 months (n=14) and the addition of an ACE-I followed by titration upon addition and at 3 and 6 months (n=20) to the drug regimen treatment protocol in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy for whom more than 3-month administration of an ACE-I or the combination of an ACE-I plus a conventional antihypertensive was ineffective to achieve a blood pressure (BP) of 130/80 mmHg and to reduce urinary albumin to <30 mg/day. During the 12-month treatment, addition of losartan or addition of an ACE-I to the treatment protocol reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 10% and 12%, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 7% and 4%, and urinary albumin excretion by 38% and 20% of the baseline value, respectively. However, the effects on both BP and urinary albumin were not significantly different between the two therapies. In conclusion, addition of losartan or an ACE-I to an ongoing treatment with an ACE-I, or addition of an ACE-I to ongoing treatment with a conventional antihypertensive were equally effective at reducing the urinary albumin excretion and BP, and provided renal protection in patients with type-2 diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "939": "Adenosine is known as an endogenous cardioprotectant. We previously reported that plasma adenosine levels increase in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), and that a treatment that further elevates plasma adenosine levels may improve the pathophysiology of CHF. Therefore, we performed a prospective, open-randomized clinical trial to determine whether or not exposure to dipyridamole for 1 year improves CHF pathophysiology compared with conventional treatments. The study enrolled 28 patients (mean+/-SEM: 66+/-4 years of age) attending specialized CHF outpatient clinics with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III, no major complications, and stable CHF status during the most recent 6 months under fixed medications. They were randomized into three groups with or without dipyridamole (Control: n=9; 75 mg/day: n=9; 300 mg/day: n=10) in addition to their original medications and were followed up for 1 year. The other drugs were not altered. Among the enrolled patients, 100%, 4%, 100%, and 79% received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone analogue, loop diuretics, and beta-adrenoceptor blocker, respectively. Fifteen patients suffered from dilated cardiomyopathy, and 7/3/3 patients suffered from ischemic/valvular/hypertensive heart diseases, respectively. Mean blood pressure was comparable among the groups. While the baseline conditions were comparable, we found that echocardiographic ejection fraction (p<0.01 vs. baseline, p<0.01 vs. Control), left ventricular systolic diameter (p<0.05, p<0.05), Specific Activity Scale (SAS) score (p<0.05, p<0.01), maximal oxygen consumption (p<0.05, p<0.05) and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level (p<0.01, p<0.01) were significantly improved in patients with dipyridamole after 1 year, generally in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, we suggest that an additional administration of dipyridamole further improves CHF pathophysiology.",

Aldosterone breakthrough during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy was reported in hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal disease.

Although UAE was significantly decreased in patients with or without aldosterone breakthrough at 6 months, it was increased again at 15 months of treatment in patients with aldosterone breakthrough. Treatment with spironolactone markedly reduced UAE in these patients.",

    "945": "1. The aim of the present study was to determine whether inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) elevates arterial blood pressure and whether any such effect is dependent on genetic background, the sympathetic nervous system and Y(1) receptors. The rationale behind this study was that: (i) neuropeptide (NP) Y(1-36) and peptide YY(1-36) (PYY(1-36)) are endogenous Y(1) receptor agonists and are metabolised by DPP IV to NPY(3-36) and PYY(3-36), which are not Y(1) but rather selective Y(2) receptor agonists; (ii) Y(1) receptors mediate vasoconstriction, whereas Y(2) receptors have little effect on vascular tone; (iii) vaso-constrictor effect of the Y(1) receptor is enhanced in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats; and (iv) NPY(1-36) is released from sympathetic nerve terminals. 2. We examined the effects of acute administration of 3-N-[(2S,3S)-2-amino-3-methylpentanoyl]-1,3-thiazolidine (P32/98; a DPP IV inhibitor) on arterial blood pressure in anaesthetized adult SHR and WKY rats in the absence and presence of either captopril, hydralazine or chlorisondamine to lower basal mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) by different mechanisms (inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, direct vasodilation and ganglionic blockade, respectively). 3. In na\u00efve SHR with severely elevated basal blood pressures (MABP = 176 +/- 3 mmHg; n = 4), i.v. boluses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of P32/98 did not affect blood pressure. 4. When basal blood pressure was reduced by pretreatment of SHR with either captopril (30 mg/kg, i.v.; MABP = 116 +/- 3 mmHg; n = 9) or hydralazine (5 mg/kg, i.p.; MABP = 84 +/- 3 mmHg; n = 7), P32/98 (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) caused significant dose-related increases in arterial blood pressure (4 +/- 2, 10 +/- 2 and 12 +/- 3 mmHg in the captopril-pretreated group, respectively (P < 0.01); 5 +/- 2, 8 +/- 3 and 11 +/- 4 mmHg in the hydralazine-pretreated group, respectively (P < 0.01)). 5. The increases in arterial blood pressure induced by P32/98 in captopril- or hydralazine-pretreated SHR were entirely blocked by pretreatment with the selective Y(1) receptor antagonist N2-(diphenylacetyl)-N-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-d-arginine amide (BIBP 3226; 6 mg/kg per h). 6. When basal blood pressure was reduced in SHR by pretreatment with chlorisondamine (10 mg/kg, s.c.; MABP = 108 +/- 4 mmHg; n = 7), inhibition of DPP IV with P32/98 did not affect arterial blood pressure. Basal heart rate in chlorisondamine-treated SHR was significantly reduced compared with na\u00efve SHR, captopril-pretreated SHR and hydralazine-pretreated SHR, indicating effectiveness of ganglionic blockade. 7. Unlike the results in genetically hypertensive animals, in normotensive WKY rats pretreated with captopril (30 mg/kg, i.v.; MABP = 81 +/- 4 mmHg; n = 6), or hydralazine (5 mg/kg, i.p.; MABP = 63 +/- 4 mmHg; n = 4) or chlorisondamine (10 mg/kg, s.c.; MABP = 63 +/- 4 mmHg; n = 5), P32/98 did not affect arterial blood pressure. 8. We conclude that, in genetically susceptible animals, inhibition of DPP IV increases arterial blood pressure via Y(1) receptors when elevated blood pressure is reduced with antihypertensive drugs provided that the sympathetic nervous system is functional. The results suggest vigilance because DPP IV inhibitors are used more widely in hypertensive patients treated with antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "946": "In this study, we have identified novel antihypertensive peptides derived from egg-white proteins. The sequences YRGGLEPINF and ESIINF produced an acute blood-pressure-lowering effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats upon a single oral administration. Our results suggest that the antihypertensive action could be attributed to a vascular-relaxing mechanism that would occur in vivo independently of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, because neither these peptides nor their main digestion fragments, except for the dipeptide YR, acted as ACE inhibitors in vitro. The vasodilator and antihypertensive activity of the sequences ESI and NF would explain the blood-pressure-lowering effect of ESIINF. With regard to YRGGLEPINF, in addition to NF, YR appeared as the main fragment responsible for its activity. The dipeptide YR, named kyotorphin and previously identified as an endogenous analgesic neuropeptide in the central nervous system, showed strong vasodilator and antihypertensive properties. The structure-activity features of the vasodilator peptides are discussed.", 
    "947": "Two first-line antihypertensive therapies for initiating treatment in hypertension were compared, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) zofenopril and the beta-blocker atenolol. The study was multi-centre and double-blind, and included 304 middle-aged to elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were randomized to receive either zofenopril 30-60 mg once daily (od) or atenolol 50-100 mg od for 4 weeks with the possibility to an up-titration in non-responding patients. The higher dose level was then administered until 12 weeks after randomization. Blood pressures (BPs) were substantially reduced by either treatment, but after 4 weeks, the systolic and diastolic BP reductions were significantly greater (p < 0.05) with zofenopril (-15.6/-13.5 mmHg) compared with atenolol (-13.1/-11.8 mmHg). After 12 weeks and the possibility of dose up-titration, BP differences between treatments were no longer significant. However, control rates (sitting diastolic BP < 90 mmHg) for zofenopril remained significantly higher compared with atenolol. The number of subjects with adverse drug reactions possibly or probably related to the study medication was 14 (9.1%) in the zofenopril group and 30 (20.8%) in the atenolol group (p = 0.008). It is concluded that zofenopril as well as atenolol induces substantial reductions of diastolic BP in middle-aged to elderly patients with hypertension. However, the control rate when initiating antihypertensive therapy with zofenopril is higher than that for atenolol.", 
    "948": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and calcium antagonists are today extensively used as first-line monotherapy as well as appropriate combination therapy in mild to moderate hypertension. In a parallel-group study, using clinically recommended doses, the ACEI zofenopril was compared with the calcium antagonist amlodipine in respect of their antihypertensive properties. In the study, 303 hypertensive patients, aged 18-75 years, were compared in terms of antihypertensive response and adverse effects after treatment with zofenopril, 30-60 mg once daily or amlodipine 5-10 mg od. After receiving the lower starting dose, up-titration was optional at 4 weeks to the higher dose if diastolic pressure (DBP) was 90 mmHg or more or if a decrease from base line of < 10 mmHg was present. After 4 weeks and appropriate up-titration of dose in non-responder patients, there were significant and similar reductions of sitting DBP by -10.0 and -9.9 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) by -13.0 and -13.2 mmHg the in the zofenopril and amlodipine groups, respectively. After 12 weeks of therapy, there were further reductions in blood pressure (BP) by the respective therapies. Thus, the higher zofenopril dose lowered SBP/DBP by 15.7/12.0 mmHg and the higher amlodipine dose by 17.1/ 12.2 mmHg (ns). Also, at the end of the study, the percentage of patients controlled (with sitting DBP < 90 mmHg) was 61.4% in the amlodipine and 62.2% in the zofenopril group and the percentage controlled (with sitting DBP < 90 mmHg and/or a decrease of at least 10 mmHg) was 76.4 in the amlodipine and 70.1 in the zofenopril groups (both ns). We conclude that SBP as well as DBP were substantially reduced in mild to moderate hypertensive patients over 12 weeks treatment with zofenopril or amlodipine in monotherapy. Thus, given the size of the BP reduction, such treatments are likely to produce beneficial cardiovascular outcome effects in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "949": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are used in the management of a range of cardiovascular disorders and are well established in primary as well as secondary cardiovascular prevention programmes. Over the years, several second- and third-generation ACEIs have been introduced into the clinic. In a comparative study in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, the efficacy and safety of zofenopril 30 mg od (with an up-titration to 60 mg od after 4 weeks in non-responder patients) was compared with enalapril 20 mg od (with an up-titration to 40 mg od after 4 weeks in nonresponders) during 12 weeks of treatment. Both treatments significantly reduced systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). BP reduction was significantly greater with zofenopril (30 mg/day) during the initial 4 weeks of treatment compared with enalapril (20 mg/day). A larger proportion of patients needed dose up-titration with enalapril compared with zofenopril to reach preset BP goals. After 12 weeks of treatment and after appropriate dose up-titration, SBP and DBPs were lowered to similar extent in the two treatment groups, resulting in no differences between the groups in terms of response and control rates. A similar number of patients reported adverse events in the two study groups. However, the severity of adverse events were significantly milder with zofenopril compared with enalapril. In mild to moderate hypertensive patients, zofenopril treatment results in a more pronounced lowering of BP compared with enalapril at recommended dose levels. Additionally, at clinical and comparative antihypertensive doses, zofenopril presents a more beneficial adverse event profile compared with enalapril.", 
    "950": "In a parallel double-blind multicentre study, 375 hypertensive patients were enrolled and treated with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) zofenopril 30 mg once daily (titration 60 mg od) or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist losartan 50 mg od (titration 100 mg od). Patients with mild to moderate hypertension, defined as a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 110 mmHg in the sitting position without other signs of cardiovascular disease were enrolled and treated for 12 weeks. BP was assessed in the clinic, and self-measured by the patients at home during a working day and a holiday, as well as before and at the clinic follow-ups. Systolic (SBP) and DBP were significantly reduced in both treatment groups to a similar extent at the end of the 12-week study. However, the immediate or early reduction of DBP as well as DBP reduction over the first month was significantly greater with zofenopril (p= 0 .01 and p= 0 .003, respectively) compared with losartan treatment. After 3 months of treatment and dose up-titration, clinic BP reductions were similar in both groups. However, more subjects with losartan had used a higher dose step (42.1%) compared with zofenopril (33.1%). Home BP assessments demonstrated that systolic and diastolic pressures were substantially lower than the BP measurements made by sphygmomanometer in the clinic. In particular, assessments 2-3 days before the clinic visits during working days and holidays were characteristically lower, while the measurements during the clinic visits were largely similar to the conventional BP measurements by the doctor. The number and the severity of adverse events, related to the study medications, were largely benign and similar in both groups. The present study demonstrates that zofenopril in clinically recommended doses is at least therapeutically equivalent to losartan treatment, when assessed by conventional sphygmomanometry at the doctor's office or at home by self-measured BP assessments by the patients. Zofenopril however, induces a more rapid initial lowering of BP over the first month of therapy."
