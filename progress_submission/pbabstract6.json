    "1": "The medical records of patients treated for N3 positive BC in Hacettepe Cancer Institute between 2005 and 2012 were evaluated. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) users were defined as patients who took these medications for at least 6 months in no evidence of disease (NED) stage after the initial diagnosis. The primary and secondary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models were used.", 
    "2": "A total of 218 pathologic N3 BC patients were included. Follow up ranged from 12 to 212 months (median 49.58). Thirty one patients used ACE inhibitors/ARBs. Univariate analysis showed BC recurrence was lower and OS was higher among patients who used ACE inhibitors/ ARBs, however without reaching statistical significance (p=0.38 and p=0.24, respectively). RAS inhibition was associated with reduced risk of pathologic N3 BC recurrence.", 
    "3": "To the best of our knowledge this is the second study showing that the use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs may be effective in N3 BC. Because of the limited therapeutic options in BC, new drugs or new therapeutic modalities should be considered. In the future, studies with long-term follow-up may be helpful for their implication in clinical practice.", 
    "4": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system attenuates the progression of experimental and clinical Alport syndrome (AS); however, the underlying mechanism(s) remains largely unknown. We evaluated the renin-angiotensin system in 4- and 7-week-old homozygous for collagen, type IV, \u03b13 gene (Col4A3(-/-)) and wild-type mice, a model of AS characterized by proteinuria and progressive renal injury. Renal angiotensin (Ang) II levels increased, whereas renal Ang-(1-7) levels decreased in 7-week-old Col4a3(-/-) mice compared with age-matched controls; these changes were partially reversed by recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) treatment. The expression of both the angiotensinogen and renin protein increased in Col4a3(-/-) compared with wild-type mice. Consistent with the Ang-(1-7) levels, the expression and activity of kidney ACE2 decreased in 7-week-old Col4a3(-/-) mice. The urinary excretion rate of ACE2 paralleled the decline in tissue expression. Expression of an Ang II-induced gene, heme oxygenase-1, was up-regulated in the kidneys of 7-week-old Col4a3(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice by microarray analysis. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression was increased in kidneys of Col4a3(-/-) mice and normalized by treatment with ACE inhibitor. Urinary HO-1 excretion paralleled renal HO-1 expression. In conclusion, progressive kidney injury in AS is associated with changes in expression of intrarenal renin Ang system components and Ang peptides. HO-1 and ACE2 may represent novel markers of AS-associated kidney injury, whereas administration of recombinant ACE2 and/or Ang-(1-7) may represent novel therapeutic approaches in AS.", 
    "5": "Proteinuria is a hallmark of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and a good predictor of clinical outcome. Selective endothelin A (ETA) receptor antagonist used with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors prevents development of proteinuria in CKD. However, whether the improvement in proteinuria would have beneficial effects on CVD, independent of RAS inhibition, is not well understood. In this study, we investigated whether atrasentan, an ETA receptor antagonist, has renal and cardiovascular effects independent of RAS inhibition. Male Dahl salt sensitive (DSS) rats, at six weeks of age, received water with or without different doses of atrasentan and/or enalapril under high salt (HS) diet or normal diet (ND) for 6 weeks. At the end of 12th week, atrasentan at a moderate dose significantly attenuated proteinuria and serum creatinine without reducing mean arterial pressure (MAP), thereby preventing cardiac hypertrophy and improving cardiac function. ACE inhibitor enalapril at a dose that did not significantly lowered BP, attenuated cardiac hypertrophy while moderately improving cardiac function without reducing proteinuria and serum creatinine level. Nonetheless, combined therapy of atrasentan and enalapril that does not altering BP exerted additional cardioprotective effect. Based on these findings, we conclude that BP independent monotherapy of ETA receptor antagonist attenuates the progression of CKD and significantly mitigates CVD independent of RAS inhibition.",

    "10": "The mechanism of a lower incidence of dermatological manifestations in patients treated with enalapril compared to patients treated with other ACE-inhibitors, e.g., captopril, is not known. The finding that prolidase plays an important role in collagen biosynthesis and that some angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect prolidase activity led us to evaluate its effect on collagen biosynthesis in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Since insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) are the most potent stimulators of both collagen biosynthesis and prolidase activity, and prolidase is regulated by \u03b21 integrin signaling, the effect of enalapril and enalaprilat on IGF-IR, TGF-\u03b21, and \u03b21 integrin receptor expressions was evaluated. Cells were treated with milimolar concentrations (0.3 and 0.5\u00a0mM) of enalapril and enalaprilat for 24\u00a0h. The activity of prolidase was determined by colorimetic assay. Collagen biosynthesis was evaluated by radiometric assay. Expression of signaling proteins was evaluated using Western blot. It was found that enalapril- and enalaprilat-dependent increase in prolidase activity and expression was accompanied by parallel increase in collagen biosynthesis. The exposure of the cells to 0.5\u00a0mM enalapril and enalaprilat contributed to increase in IGF-IR and \u03b12\u03b21 integrin receptor as well as TGF-\u03b21 and NF-\u03baB p65 expressions. Enalapril- and enalaprilat-dependent increase of collagen biosynthesis in fibroblasts results from increase of prolidase activity and expression, which may undergo through activation of \u03b12\u03b21 integrin and IGF-IR signaling as well as upregulation of TGF-\u03b21 and NF-\u03baB p65, the inhibitor of collagen gene expression.", 
    "11": "Studies in our laboratory have revealed that furosemide-induced RAAS activation, evaluated via the urine aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio (UAldo:C), was not attenuated by the coadministration of benazepril, while enalapril successfully suppressed amlodipine-induced urinary aldosterone excretion. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of enalapril in suppressing ACE activity and furosemide-induced circulating RAAS activation. Failure to do so would suggest that this failure may be a drug class effect. We hypothesized that enalapril would suppress ACE activity and furosemide-induced circulating RAAS activation. Sixteen healthy hound dogs. The effect of furosemide (2 mg/kg PO, q12 h; Group F) and furosemide plus enalapril (0.5 mg/kg PO, q12 h; Group FE) on circulating RAAS was determined by plasma ACE activity, 4-6 h post-treatment, and urinary A:C on days -1, -2, 1, 4, and 7. There was a significant increase in the average urine aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio (UAldo:C) after administration of furosemide (P < 0.05). Enalapril inhibited ACE activity (P < 0.0001) but did not significantly reduce aldosterone excretion. A significant (P < 0.05) increase in the UAldo:C was maintained for the 7 days of the study in both groups. Enalapril decreased plasma ACE activity; however, it did not suppress furosemide-induced RAAS activation, as determined by the UAldo:C. While enalapril blunts ACE activity, the absence of circulating RAAS suppression may be due to angiotensin II reactivation, alternative RAAS pathways, and furosemide overriding concurrent ACE inhibition, all indicating the existence of aldosterone breakthrough (ABT). Along with similar findings with benazepril, it appears that failure to suppress aldosterone suppression with furosemide stimulation may be a drug class effect. The discrepancy between the current data and the documented benefits of enalapril likely reflects the efficacy of this ACE inhibitor in suppressing tissue RAAS, variable population responsiveness to ACE-inhibition, and/or providing additional survival benefits, possibly through as yet unknown mechanisms.",

    "33": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]/angiotensin II [Ang II] and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]/Ang-1-7) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory response and acute lung injury (ALI). Previous studies have shown that the ACE inhibitor captopril (Cap) may be a potent therapeutic drug for ALI. However, the mechanisms of its protective effects on ALI are still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Cap on preventing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury and further investigated the underlying mechanisms of these protective effects. Rats were intraperitoneally pretreated with Cap (50 mg/kg) 30 min prior to an intravenous administration of LPS (7.5 mg/kg). Furthermore, following a 30-min pretreatment with Cap (10 mol/mL) or combined with the ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 (10 mol/mL), rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were stimulated with LPS (1 mg/mL). Captopril pretreatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced pathophysiological changes in the lung, inhibited secretion of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 6, reduced the ratio of Ang II to Ang-1-7, and reversed the increased ratio of ACE to ACE2, which was remarkably decreased from 7.07 (LPS only) to 1.71 (LPS + Cap). The protective effects of Cap on ALI were also confirmed by in vitro studies, in which Cap suppressed LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and modulated the expression levels of ACE and ACE2. After Cap pretreatment, the ratio of ACE to ACE2 expression was remarkably decreased from 5.18 (LPS alone) to 1.52 (LPS + Cap). Furthermore, Cap given before LPS administration led to inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) phosphorylation in PMVECs, whereas MLN4760 abolished the protective effects of Cap on LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and abolished Cap-induced blockade of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK phosphorylation. Our findings reveal that Cap exerts protective effects on LPS-induced lung injury and the cytotoxicity of PMVECs, and these effects may, at least in part, regulate the balance of ACE and ACE2 expression and inhibit the activation of MAPKs.", 
    "34": "Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) shares structural similarities with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE inhibitors have been described to inhibit MMP-2, but this inhibitory potential was not shown using a highly purified MMP-2. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory potential of captopril and lisinopril regarding MMP-2 activity. The first objective was to test the potential of captopril to change the pH of the buffer solution. The second objective was to test the direct inhibitory effect of captopril and lisinopril on plasma MMP-2 and on recombinant human MMP-2 (rhMMP-2). The in vitro activity assays included gelatin zymography and a fluorimetric assay. Captopril solubilization significantly decreased the pH of the 50 mM Tris buffer solution at the following concentrations: 2 mM (p < 0.05), 4 mM and 8 mM (p < 0.01), while only the 8 mM lisinopril induced a drop in pH (p < 0.05). Thus, only 200 mM buffer solutions were used. Zymography results of plasma MMP-2 and rhMMP-2 showed that inhibition only happened at captopril concentrations \u2265 4 and 1 mM, respectively (p < 0.05), while only the higher concentration of lisinopril (8 mM) inhibited plasma MMP-2 (p < 0.05). In the fluorimetric assay, captopril led to significant inhibition of the rhMMP-2 activity at concentrations \u22652 mM (p < 0.01), whereas aminophenylmercuric acetate-activated rhMMP-2 was inhibited by 0.5 mM captopril (p < 0.01). The captopril and lisinopril concentrations found to inhibit MMP-2 are 3 orders of magnitude higher than those present in vivo after drug administration. We also discuss possible pitfalls for gelatinase inhibitory assays (besides the obvious pH problem already cited). In conclusion, this study's data show that captopril and lisinopril did not inhibit MMP-2 directly at the concentrations reached in vivo.",

    "41": "Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death, and lowering blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs reduces target organ damage and prevents cardiovascular disease outcomes. Despite a plethora of available treatment options, a substantial portion of the hypertensive population has uncontrolled blood pressure. The unmet need of controlling blood pressure in this population may be addressed, in part, by developing new drugs and devices/procedures to treat hypertension and its comorbidities. In this Compendium Review, we discuss new drugs and interventional treatments that are undergoing preclinical or clinical testing for hypertension treatment. New drug classes, eg, inhibitors of vasopeptidases, aldosterone synthase and soluble epoxide hydrolase, agonists of natriuretic peptide A and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2, and a novel mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist are in phase II/III of development, while inhibitors of aminopeptidase A, dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase, and the intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3, agonists of components of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin(1-7)/Mas receptor axis and vaccines directed toward angiotensin II and its type 1 receptor are in phase I or preclinical development. The two main interventional approaches, transcatheter renal denervation and baroreflex activation therapy, are used in clinical practice for severe treatment resistant hypertension in some countries. Renal denervation is also being evaluated for treatment of various comorbidities, eg, chronic heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and chronic renal failure. Novel interventional approaches in early development include carotid body ablation and arteriovenous fistula placement. Importantly, none of these novel drug or device treatments has been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease outcomes or death in hypertensive patients.",

Here, we review the recent literature on the alterations in small and large arteries in hypertension. We discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these abnormalities and we explain how they accompany and often precede hypertension. Finally, we propose an integrated pathophysiological approach to better understand how the cross-talk between large and small artery changes interacts in pressure wave transmission, exaggerates cardiac, brain and kidney damage, and lead to cardiovascular and renal complications. We focus on patients with essential hypertension because this is the most prevalent form of hypertension, and describe other forms of hypertension only for contrasting their characteristics with those of uncomplicated essential hypertension.", 
    "43": "Blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), that is, renin inhibitors, angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ang II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, are a cornerstone in the treatment of hypertension. How exactly they exert their effect, in particular in patients with low circulating RAAS activity, also taking into consideration the so-called Ang II/aldosterone escape that often occurs after initial blockade, is still incompletely understood. Multiple studies have tried to find parameters that predict the response to RAAS blockade, allowing a personalized treatment approach. Consequently, the question should now be answered on what basis (eg, sex, ethnicity, age, salt intake, baseline renin, ACE or aldosterone, and genetic variance) a RAAS blocker can be chosen to treat an individual patient. Are all blockers equal? Does optimal blockade imply maximum RAAS blockade, for example, by combining \u22652 RAAS blockers or by simply increasing the dose of 1 blocker? Exciting recent investigations reveal a range of unanticipated extrarenal effects of aldosterone, as well as a detailed insight in the genetic causes of primary aldosteronism, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers have now become an important treatment option for resistant hypertension. Finally, apart from the deleterious ACE-Ang II-Ang II type 1 receptor arm, animal studies support the existence of protective aminopeptidase A-Ang III-Ang II type 2 receptor and ACE2-Ang-(1 to 7)-Mas receptor arms, paving the way for multiple new treatment options. This review provides an update about all these aspects, critically discussing the many controversies and allowing the reader to obtain a full understanding of what we currently know about RAAS alterations in hypertension.",

This paper traces the research path that culminated in the development of this drug. The first phase, elucidation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, began with Tigerstedt's discovery of renin, followed by isolation of angiotensin, isolation of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and synthesis of its inhibitors and of angiotensin receptor blockers. Phase 2 began with de Bold's discovery of atrial natriuretic peptide, followed by isolation of the enzyme that degrades it (neprilysin) and its inhibitors. Phase 3 consists of blocking both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide-degrading systems simultaneously.

After 6 months, prescription of BB (92% vs 83%), ACE-I/ARB (92% vs 90%) and MRA (68% vs 67%) did not differ significantly between groups. The proportions of patients who achieved \u226550% and \u2265100% of target doses of BB, ACE-I/ARB and MRA were also similar in each group.

In the hypokalemic patients, the most important reasons were gastrointestinal losses in 555 (91.8%) patients and renal losses in 252 (41.7%) patients. The most frequent treatment strategies were correcting the underlying cause and replacing the potassium deficit. Of the 604 hypokalemic patients, 319 (52.8%) were normokalemic at hospital discharge. The most common reason for hyperkalemia was treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in 228 (34.4%) patients, followed by renal failure in 191 (28.8%). Two hundred and ninety-eight (45.0%) patients were followed without any specific treatment. Of the 661 hyperkalemic patients, 324 (49.0%) were normokalemic at hospital discharge.",

    "57": "The goal for this work was to characterize basic biological properties of a novel Arthrospira platensis-based aqueous cyanophyta extract (ACE), enriched in the known anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor phycocyanin (PC), but also containing a high level of non-PC bioactive compounds. Antioxidant properties were tested in parallel in the Folin-Ciocalteu assay (chemical antioxidant capacity) and in the cellular antioxidant protection (CAP-e) bioassay, where both the PC and the non-PC fractions contributed to the antioxidant capacity and CAP of ACE. In contrast to the COX-2 inhibition seen in the presence of PC, the inhibition of enzymatic activity of the inflammatory mediator Lipoxygenase was associated specifically with the non-PC fraction of ACE. Inhibition of formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated using polymorphonuclear cells from healthy human donors. The inhibition of ROS formation was seen for both the PC and non-PC fractions, with ACE showing the most robust effect. The effects of PC, non-PC, and ACE on clotting and clot lysing was tested using a modified Euglobulin fibrinolytic assay in vitro. In the presence of PC, non-PC, and ACE, the time for clot formation and lysis was not affected; however, the clots were significantly more robust. This effect was statistically significant (p<.05) at doses between 125-500 \u03bcg/mL, and returned to baseline at lower doses. Both PC and the non-PC fraction contributed to the antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory effects, without a negative impact on blood clotting in vitro. This suggests a potential benefit for the consumable ACE extract in assisting the reduction of inflammatory conditions.", 
    "58": "Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a good source of protein, vitamins, minerals and complex carbohydrates. The objective was to compare protein profile, including anti-nutrient proteins, and potential bioactive peptides of improved common bean cultivars grown in Mexico and Brazil. Bean protein isolates (BPI) were prepared from 15 common bean cultivars and hydrolyzed using pepsin/pancreatin. Thirteen proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE and protein in-gel tryptic-digestion-LC/MS. Protein profile was similar among common bean cultivars with high concentrations of defense-related proteins. Major identified proteins were phaseolin, lectin, protease and \u03b1-amylase inhibitors. Lectin (159.2 to 357.9 mg lectin/g BPI), Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (inh) (4.3 to 75.5 mg trypsin inh/g BPI), Bowman-Birk inhibitor (5.4 to 14.3 \u03bcg trypsin-chymotrypsin inh/g BPI) and \u03b1-amylase inhibitor activity (2.5 to 14.9% inhibition relative to acarbose/mg BPI) were higher in Mexican beans compared to Brazilian beans. Abundant peptides were identified by HPLC-MS/MS with molecular masses ranging from 300 to 1500 Da and significant sequences were SGAM, DSSG, LLAH, YVAT, EPTE and KPKL. Potential bioactivities of sequenced peptides were angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE), dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor (DPP-IV) and antioxidant capacity. Peptides from common bean proteins presented potential biological activities related to control of hypertension and type-2 diabetes.", 
    "59": "Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetic nephropathy is the most common primary disease necessitating dialysis treatment in the world including Japan. Major guidelines for treatment of hypertension in Japan, the United States and Europe recommend the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, which suppress the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), as the antihypertensive drugs of first choice in patients with coexisting diabetes. However, even with the administration of RAS inhibitors, failure to achieve adequate anti-albuminuric, renoprotective effects and a reduction in cardiovascular events has also been reported. Inadequate blockade of aldosterone may be one of the reasons why long-term administration of RAS inhibitors may not be sufficiently effective in patients with diabetic nephropathy. This review focuses on treatment in diabetic nephropathy and discusses the significance of aldosterone blockade. In pre-nephropathy without overt nephropathy, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist can be used to enhance the blood pressure-lowering effects of RAS inhibitors, improve insulin resistance and prevent clinical progression of nephropathy. In CKD categories A2 and A3, the addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist to an RAS inhibitor can help to maintain 'long-term' antiproteinuric and anti-albuminuric effects. However, in category G3a and higher, sufficient attention must be paid to hyperkalemia. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are not currently recommended as standard treatment in diabetic nephropathy. However, many studies have shown promise of better renoprotective effects if mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are appropriately used.", 
    "60": "Diabetic kidney disease is a leading cause of renal failure in Germany. Albuminuria is an early diagnostic indicator of renal damage in diabetes and, aside from renal failure, a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease. An early diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease is of great importance to reduce associated cardiovascular mortality; glycemic control should aim for HbA1c levels of <\u20097\u2009%. Guidelines on blood pressure differ, but it should generally be reduced to <\u2009140/90\u00a0mmHg; stricter limits should be applied if albuminuria is present. ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be preferred for blood pressure control. A combination of ACE-Is and ARBs or a renin-inhibitor therapy does not improve cardiovascular outcome, instead it increases the rate of adverse events, e.g., hyperkalemia or renal failure. Lipid control, usually with statins, should be started at an early phase of renal failure. Vitamin\u00a0D receptor activation and uric acid reduction might play a future role in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. Pharmacological modification of inflammatory signaling appears to be promising but is not yet of clinical relevance.",

This is particularly the case for patients with multivessel coronary disease who are treated with percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A considerable part of the IHD population are subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS) who participate in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR) programs as a part of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

All subjects were examined twice 2 months apart - at the referral for CCR and after completion of CCR. MetS was diagnosed based on the measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and fasting blood glucose levels. In all subjects, UA level was also measured and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) were calculated. Following clinical evaluation and exercise test, each patient underwent 24 interval training sessions on a cycle ergometer. The patients received drug therapy including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and acetylsalicylic acid. As a part of CCR, the patients also received education regarding healthy lifestyle changes including physical activity, healthy diet, stress coping techniques, effects of nicotine and alcohol, and effective methods to eliminate these habits.",

Irrespective of the type of cardiac intervention, significant increases in exercise capacity and physical effort tolerance were observed after 2 months of CCR (p < 0.00001). TG level increased in all participants (p = 0.0514) and in the PCI subgroup (p = 0.0489). Systolic blood pressure decreased in all participants (p = 0.0216) and in the PCI subgroup (p = 0.0043). Mean UA level also decreased in all patients regardless of the type of cardiac intervention. Overall, the proportion of patients with the diagnosis of MetS did not change significantly after 2 months of CCR (36% vs. 31%, p > 0.05). However, the rate of MetS decreased in the PCI subgroup (from 46% to 29%, p = 0.043) and increased in the CABG subgroup (from 11% do 37%, p = 0.0562).",

The metabolic risk decreased in patients treated with PCI, while it increased in those treated with CABG. In order to reduce the metabolic risk, particularly in CABG patients, a CCR program requires intensification of the patient support including educational activities regarding diet and weight reduction as well as individually prescribed physical activity.", 
    "66": "We investigated the involvement of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the renin-angiotensin system in N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertension. Male Wistar rats were treated with L-NAME (75.0 mg\u00b7(kg body mass)(-1)\u00b7day(-1), in their drinking water) for different durations (1-33 days). COX-2 and renin mRNA were measured using real-time PCR in the renal cortex, and prostanoids were assessed in the renal perfusate, whereas angiotensin II (Ang\u2009II) and Ang\u2009(1-7) were quantified in plasma. In some rats, nitric oxide synthase inhibition was carried out in conjunction with oral administration of captopril (30.0 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) or celecoxib (1.0 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) for 2 or 19 days. We found a parallel increase in renocortical COX-2 and renin mRNA starting at day 2 of treatment with L-NAME, and both peaked at 19-25 days. In addition, L-NAME increased renal 6-Keto-PGF(1\u03b1) (prostacyclin (PGI2) metabolite) and plasma Ang\u2009II from day 2, but reduced plasma Ang\u2009(1-7) at day 19. Captopril prevented the increase in blood pressure, which was associated with lower plasma Ang\u2009II and increased COX-2-derived 6-Keto-PGF(1\u03b1) at day 2 and plasma Ang\u2009(1-7) at day 19. Celecoxib partially prevented the increase in blood pressure; this effect was associated with a reduction in plasma Ang\u2009II. These findings indicate that renal COX-2 expression increased in parallel with renin expression, renal PGI2 synthesis, and plasma Ang\u2009II in L-NAME-induced hypertension.",

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above targets despite treatment with at least three antihypertensive drugs in adequate dose and combination. Nonadherence is a frequent cause of uncontrolled hypertension and can be improved by providing fixed dose (of two or three agents) single pill combination. Triple combination of the most widely used antihypertensive agents (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists, calcium channel blockers and diuretics) is a safe and effective therapy. Fourth line therapy is the use of an aldosterone antagonist. Renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation can be considered in patients who remained uncontrolled despite optimal medical therapy.",

Efforts to include the phosphorus content of foods on the nutrition label in the US have, to date, been fruitless. Another source of phosphorus, largely unrecognized, is prescription medications. These may contain phosphorus as indicated on their package label; the amount is not quantified. We examined the labels of the branded forms of 200 of the most widely prescribed medications in Dialysis Clinic centers in the United States and found that 23 (11.5%) contained phosphorus. A sampling of different doses and manufacturers (generic and branded) of these drugs was analyzed for phosphorus content and found levels as high as 111.5\u2009mg/dose (40\u2009mg paroxetine). Notable were the phosphorus content of a generic 10\u2009mg lisinopril (32.6\u2009mg) and a generic 10\u2009mg amlodipine (40.1\u2009mg). The significant potential for iatrogenic injury accruing from the use of these drugs warrants efforts at remediation. Specific information on the phosphorus content of medications used by dialysis population needs to be made available to the dialysis community.",

Furthermore, Ang 1-7 levels were elevated by both ACE inhibitors, but only lisinopril decreased the Ang 1-5/Ang 1-7 ratio. This indicates LisW-S C-domain specificity as Ang 1-5 is generated by hydrolysis of Ang 1-7 by the N-domain. Further corroboration of LisW-S C-domain specificity is that only lisinopril increased the circulating levels of the N-domain ACE substrate Ac-SDKP.",

    "73": "Skeletal metastases are an incurable complication afflicting the majority of patients who die from advanced breast cancer. They are most often osteolytic, characterized by net bone destruction and suppressed new bone formation. Life expectancy from first diagnosis of breast cancer bone metastases is several years, during which time skeletal-related events - including pain, fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression - significantly degrade quality of life. The bone marrow niche can also confer hormonal and chemo-resistance. Most treatments for skeletal metastases target bone-destroying osteoclasts and are palliative. Recent results from the Breast cancer trials of Oral Everolimus-2 trial suggest that agents such as the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus may have efficacy against breast cancer bone metastases in part via stimulating osteoblasts as well as by inhibiting tumor growth. Selective estrogen receptor modulators similarly inhibit growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers while having positive effects on the skeleton. This review discusses the future role of bone-anabolic agents for the specific treatment of osteolytic breast cancer metastases. Agents with both anti-tumor and bone-anabolic actions have been tested in the setting of multiple myeloma, a hematological malignancy that causes severe osteolytic bone loss and suppression of osteoblastic new bone formation. Stimulation of osteoblast activity inhibits multiple myeloma growth - a strategy that might decrease breast cancer burden in osteolytic bone metastases. Proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib and carfilzomib) inhibit the growth of myeloma directly and are anabolic for bone. Drugs with limited anti-tumor activity but which are anabolic for bone include intermittent parathyroid hormone and antibodies that neutralize the WNT inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin, as well as the activin A blocker sotatercept and the osteoporosis drug strontium ranelate. Transforming growth factor-beta inhibitors have little tumor antiproliferative activity but block breast cancer production of osteolytic factors and are also anabolic for bone. Some of these treatments are already in clinical trials. This review provides an overview of agents with bone-anabolic properties, which may have utility in the treatment of breast cancer metastatic to the skeleton.",

Concomitant nephrotoxic agents, however, including loop diuretics, vasopressors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were significantly associated with the development of nephrotoxicity in medical-surgical and intensive care patients. Based on this analysis, use of loop diuretics and vasopressors increased the odds of developing nephrotoxicity (odds ratio [OR] 42.8 [p=0.001] and 18.4 [p=0.02], respectively).

With morbidity and mortality on par with HF with reduced ejection fraction, it remains a most challenging clinical syndrome for the practicing clinician and basic research scientist. Originally considered to be predominantly caused by diastolic dysfunction, more recent insights indicate that HFpEF in older persons is typified by a broad range of cardiac and non-cardiac abnormalities and reduced reserve capacity in multiple organ systems. The globally reduced reserve capacity is driven by: 1) inherent age-related changes; 2) multiple, concomitant co-morbidities; 3) HFpEF itself, which is likely a systemic disorder. These insights help explain why: 1) co-morbidities are among the strongest predictors of outcomes; 2) approximately 50% of clinical events in HFpEF patients are non-cardiovascular; 3) clinical drug trials in HFpEF have been negative on their primary outcomes. Embracing HFpEF as a true geriatric syndrome, with complex, multi-factorial pathophysiology and clinical heterogeneity could provide new mechanistic insights and opportunities for progress in management.

The PEPS were extracted and added to reconstituted skim milk (12%, wt/vol) at 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125% (wt/vol) and fermented by a non-exopolysaccharide-producing strain, Streptococcus thermophilus Australian Starter Culture Collection (ASCC) 1303 (ST 1303), or an exopolysaccharide-producing Strep. thermophilus ASCC 1275 (ST 1275). Bacterial growth, texture properties, microstructure, proteolytic capacity, and angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activities of fermented milk (FM) were determined during refrigerated storage at 4\u00b0C for 21d. Viable counts of starter bacteria in FM with 0.5% PEPS added were the highest. Changes in pH were consistent with changes in titratable acidities for all samples. The FM samples with added PEPS showed denser protein aggregates containing larger serum pores in confocal micrographs compared with those without PEPS at d 0 and 21during refrigerated storage.

    "98": "Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Updated guidelines emphasize target reduction of overall cardiovascular risks. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension have a synergistic deleterious effect on insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Unregulated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Statins are the most important in patients with hypercholesterolemia to prevent CVD by lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, improving endothelial dysfunction, and other anti-atherosclerotic effects. Unfortunately, statin therapy dose-dependently causes insulin resistance and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. RAS inhibitors improve both endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in addition to blood pressure lowering. Further, cross-talk between hypercholesterolemia and RAS exists at multiple steps of insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. In this regard, combined therapy with statins and RAS inhibitors demonstrates additive/synergistic beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in addition to lowering both cholesterol levels and blood pressure and it did reduce cardiovascular events when compared with either monotherapy in patients. This is mediated by both distinct and interrelated mechanisms. Therefore, combined therapy with statins and RAS inhibitors may be important in developing optimal management strategies in patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome or obesity to prevent or treat CVD.",

METHODS\u2004AND\u2004RESULTS: The French prospective observational cohort \"RIMA\" included 1,461 MI patients. Dosing of BB and ACEI given at 24 h and at time of discharge was assessed as follows: no treatment; <50% of target dose; or \u226550% of target dose. For in-hospital mortality, after MI, the use of BB in the first 24 h, but not ACEI, was associated with significantly lower event rate on multivariate analysis (OR, 5.78; 95% CI: 2.62-12.76, P<0.001). In contrast at 1 year, use of higher doses of ACEI, but not BB, was associated with significantly lower CV mortality, readmission for heart failure and the composite of CV mortality and readmission for heart failure (HR, 2.65; 95% CI: 1.32-5.31, P=0.006 for absence of ACEI at discharge).",

Methods Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (n=480) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) 10 mg enalapril (control group), (2) 10 mg enalapril plus 0.4 mg FA (low-FA group) or (3) 10 mg enalapril plus 0.8 mg FA (high-FA group) daily for eight weeks. The primary outcome was the UA ratio (week 8 UA: baseline UA). Results The final analysis included 450 patients (43.1% men, 27-75 years of age). An adjusted multivariable regression analysis revealed no significant differences in the UA ratio between the three groups after eight weeks of treatment. In the subgroup analysis stratified according to the baseline UA level, the high-FA group demonstrated a significantly greater UA-lowering response among the patients with an elevated baseline UA concentration (UA \u2265310 \u03bcmol/L) [median UA ratio (25th percentile, 75th percentile): 0.94 (0.83, 1.01)], compared with that observed in the control group [0.97 (0.90, 1.00), p=0.025]. Similar results were found in the participants with baseline hyperuricemia (HUA; UA: men >420 \u03bcmol/L, women >350 \u03bcmol/L). Conclusion In this sample of adult hypertensive patients, the administration of a daily dose of 10 mg of enalapril combined with 0.8 mg of FA had a greater beneficial effect on the serum UA levels than did that of 10 mg of enalapril alone in patients with either an elevated UA concentration or HUA.",

Here we aimed to test whether chronic infusion of Ang-(1-7) can dose-dependently ameliorate left ventricular remodeling and function in a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and whether the combination of Ang-(1-7) and Ang-converting enzyme inhibition may be superior to single therapy. Our results showed that Ang-(1-7) treatment dose-dependently ameliorated left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction in diabetic rats by attenuating myocardial fibrosis, myocardial hypertrophy and myocyte apoptosis via both the Mas receptor and angiotensin II type 2 receptor. Furthermore, combining Ang-(1-7) with perindopril provided additional cardioprotection relative to single therapy.

In hypertensive patients with diabetes, no difference was found for amlodipine versus comparators with respect to all-cause death, CV death, MACE, and MI; a decrease in stroke risk, and an increase in CHF risk, was seen. In hypertensive patients with renal dysfunction, no difference was found for amlodipine versus comparators with respect to all-cause death, CV death, MACE, MI, and CHF; a decrease in stroke risk was seen. Amlodipine was found to be at least as efficacious as all the other classes of antihypertensive agents in reducing systolic and diastolic BP. Long-term control of BP is critical for avoiding complications of hypertension in high-risk patients, particularly CV and cerebrovascular events such as stroke.

Data on cardiovascular events and new onset of diabetes were used from the Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study, a randomized clinical trial comparing diuretic-based (hydrochlorothiazide) versus ACEI-based (enalapril) treatment in 6083 elderly (age \u226565 years) hypertensive patients over a median 4.1-year period. For this economic analysis, the total study population was stratified into 2 groups. Group A was restricted to participants diabetes free at baseline (n\u200a=\u200a5642); group B was restricted to participants with preexisting diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) at baseline (n\u200a=\u200a441). Data on utility scores for different events were used from available published literatures; whereas, treatment and adverse event management costs were calculated from direct health care costs available from Australian government reimbursement data. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 5% per annum. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty around utilities and cost data.After a treatment period of 5 years, for group A, the ICER was Australian dollars (AUD) 27,698 (&OV0556; 18,004; AUD 1-&OV0556; 0.65) per QALY gained comparing ACEI-based treatment with diuretic-based treatment (sensitive to the utility value for new-onset diabetes). In group B, ACEI-based treatment was a dominant strategy (both more effective and cost-saving). On probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the ICERs per QALY gained were always below AUD 50,000 for group B; whereas for group A, the probability of being below AUD 50,000 was 85%.Although the dispensed price of diuretic-based treatment of hypertension in the elderly is lower, upon considering the potential enhanced likelihood of the development of diabetes in addition to the costs of treating cardiovascular disease, ACEI-based treatment may be a more cost-effective strategy in this population.",

The aim of this article is to review the effect of anaphylaxis on the heart, the potential impact of medications for CVD on anaphylaxis and anaphylaxis treatment, and the cardiovascular effects of epinephrine. The therapeutic dilemmas arising from these issues are also discussed and management strategies proposed. PubMed searches were performed for the years 1990-2014 inclusive, using terms such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, adrenaline, allergic myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-adrenergic blockers, epinephrine, and Kounis syndrome. Literature analysis indicated that: cardiac mast cells are key constituents of atherosclerotic plaques; mast cell mediators play an important role in acute coronary syndrome (ACS); patients with CVD are at increased risk of developing severe or fatal anaphylaxis; and medications for CVD treatment, including beta-adrenergic blockers and ACE inhibitors, potentially exacerbate anaphylaxis or make it more difficult to treat. Epinephrine increases myocardial contractility, decreases the duration of systole relative to diastole, and enhances coronary blood flow. Its transient adverse effects include pallor, tremor, anxiety, and palpitations. Serious adverse effects (including ventricular arrhythmias and hypertension) are rare, and are significantly more likely after intravenous injection than after intramuscular injection. Epinephrine is life-saving in anaphylaxis; second-line medications (including antihistamines and glucocorticoids) are not. In CVD patients (especially those with ACS), the decision to administer epinephrine for anaphylaxis can be difficult, and its benefits and potential harms need to be carefully considered. Concerns about potential adverse effects need to be weighed against concerns about possible death from untreated anaphylaxis, but there is no absolute contraindication to epinephrine injection in anaphylaxis.",

In this review, we discuss the key features of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and the numerous mediators that have been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy affecting gene transcription, calcium handling, protein synthesis, metabolism, autophagy, oxidative stress and inflammation. We also discuss new mediators including signaling proteins, microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs and new findings related to the role of calcineurin and calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. We also highlight mediators and processes which contribute to the transition from adaptive cardiac remodeling to maladaptive remodeling and heart failure. Treatment strategies for heart failure commonly include diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and \u03b2-blockers; however, mortality rates remain high.

Serum creatinine, GFR, and ESRD were not significantly different between the two groups. In severe DN, the occurrence of hyperkalemia and AKI were higher with combination therapy. However, in mild DN, the prevalence of hyperkalemia and AKI were the same in both the groups.

The peptide concentration affected the encapsulation efficiency and the stability of the resulting liposomes, which remained with a high zeta potential value (-54.3 mV) for at least 1 week at the most suitable peptide concentration. The optimal peptide concentration was established as 1.75 g L(-1).

    "197": "As the age of pregnant women and prevalence of obesity and diabetes are increasing, so is the prevalence of medical disorders during pregnancy, particularly hypertension and the associated CKD. Pregnancy can worsen kidney function in women with severe disease, and hypertension puts them at risk for pre-eclampsia and the associated complications. There are no specific guidelines for hypertension management in this population, and tight control will not prevent pre-eclampsia. Women with end-stage kidney disease should be placed on intense dialysis regimens to improve obstetric outcomes, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are best avoided. This article will review the rationale for a management plan that includes a multidisciplinary team to discuss risks and develop a plan before conception, antepartum monitoring for maternal and fetal morbidity, individualization of medical management using medications with established records during pregnancy, and balancing the level of blood pressure control proved to protect kidney function against the potential effects that aggressive blood pressure control could have on the fetal-placental unit.", 
    "198": "Hypertension is a prevalent problem in kidney transplant recipients that is known to be a \"traditional\" risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease leading to premature allograft failure and death. Donor, peritransplant, and recipient factors affect hypertension risk. Blood pressure control after transplantation is inversely associated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Calcineurin inhibitors, the most commonly used class of immunosuppressives, cause endothelial dysfunction, increase vascular tone, and sodium retention via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system resulting in systemic hypertension. Steroid withdrawal seems to have little impact on blood pressure control. Newer agents like belatacept appear to be associated with less hypertension. Transplant renal artery stenosis is an important, potentially treatable cause of hypertension. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers mitigate calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity and may be associated with improved estimated GFR. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are not recommended in the first 3 to 6\u00a0months given their effects on reduced estimated GFR, anemia, and hyperkalemia. The use of \u00df-blockers may be associated with improved patient survival, even for patients without cardiovascular disease. Living donation may increase blood pressure by 5\u00a0mm Hg or more. Some transplant centers accept Caucasian living donors with well-controlled hypertension on a single agent if they agree to close follow-up.", 
    "199": "Besides its epithelial effect on sodium retention and potassium excretion in the distal tubule, aldosterone promotes inflammation and fibrosis in the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels. As glomerular filtration rate falls, aldosterone is inappropriately elevated relative to extracellular fluid expansion. In addition, studies in CKD patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and/or direct renin inhibitors have shown that aldosterone levels paradoxically rise in approximately 30% to 40% of patients on these renin-angiotensin system-blocking drugs. Hence, there is interest in using mineralocorticoid receptor blockers that directly target the inflammatory and fibrotic effects of aldosterone in CKD patients. This interest, however, is tempered by a number of unresolved issues, including the safety of using such drugs in advanced CKD and ESRD populations, and the potential for differences in drug efficacy according to race and ethnicity of patient populations. A better understanding of mineralocorticoid receptor blocker pharmacology should help inform future research directions and clinical practice decisions as to how best to use these agents in CKD.", 
    "200": "Mice lacking functional neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1R-/-) display behavioural abnormalities resembling attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): locomotor hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattentiveness. The preferred ligand for NK1R, substance P, is metabolised by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), which forms part of the brain renin angiotensin system (BRAS). In view of evidence that the BRAS modulates locomotor activity and cognitive performance, we tested the effects of drugs that target the BRAS on these behaviours in NK1R-/- and wildtype mice. We first tested the effects of the ACE inhibitor, captopril, on locomotor activity. Because there are well-established sex differences in both ADHD and ACE activity, we compared the effects of captopril in both male and female mice. Locomotor hyperactivity was evident in male NK1R-/- mice, only, and this was abolished by treatment with captopril. By contrast, male wildtypes and females of both genotypes were unaffected by ACE inhibition. We then investigated the effects of angiotensin AT1 (losartan) and AT2 (PD 123319) receptor antagonists on the locomotor activity of male NK1R-/- and wildtype mice. Both antagonists increased the locomotor activity of NK1R-/- mice, but neither affected the wildtypes. Finally, we tested the effects of captopril on the performance of male NK1R-/- and wildtype mice in the 5-choice serial reaction-time task (5-CSRTT) and found that ACE inhibition prevented the impulsivity of NK1R-/- mice. These results indicate that certain behaviours, disrupted in ADHD, are influenced by an interaction between the BRAS and NK1R, and suggest that ACE inhibitors could provide a novel treatment for this disorder.",

Thalassophryne nattereri is a small venomous fish inhabiting the northern and northeastern coast of Brazil, and represents a relatively frequent cause of injuries. Its venom causes severe inflammatory response followed frequently by the necrosis of the affected area. This venom presents characterized components such as proteases (Natterins 1-4) and a lectin (Nattectin) with complex effects on the human organism. A specific inhibitor of tissue kallikrein (TKI) reduces the nociception and the edema caused by the venom in mice. Our study sought to investigate the proteolytic activities against vasopeptides Angiotensin I, Angiotensin II, Angiotensin 1-9 and Bradykinin. The venom indicated angiotensin conversion against angiotensin I, as well as kininase against bradykinin. Captopril conducted the total inhibition of the converting activity, featuring the first report of ACE activity in fish venoms.",

    "203": "Myocardial fibrosis plays a key role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The chronic pressure overload of the heart activates collagen that leads to its excessive accumulation, fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy. Myocardial injury is often accompanied by liver damage. These two processes are closely linked. One of the links of this chain is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). There is impressive evidence base for drugs that block the RAAS, and thus break the vicious cycle of cardiovascular continuum. Fibrogenesis is nonspecific process and prospect of drug application affecting the activity of the RAAS may be useful for fibrosis prevention not only for the heart and liver, but also for other organs.",

We studied 210,641 U.S. registered nurses participating in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II). Information on antihypertensive medication use was collected on biennial questionnaires in both cohorts, and breast cancer cases were ascertained during this period. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate relative risks of invasive breast cancer over follow-up (1988-2012 in NHS, 1989-2011 in NHS II) across categories of overall antihypertensive medication use and use of specific classes (diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). During follow-up, 10,012 cases of invasive breast cancer developed (6718 cases in NHS and 3294 in the NHS II). Overall, current use of any antihypertensive medication was not associated with breast cancer risk compared with past/never use in NHS (multivariable-adjusted relative risk\u00a0=\u00a01.00, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.95-1.06) or NHS II (multivariable-adjusted relative risk\u00a0=\u00a00.94, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.86-1.03). Furthermore, no specific class of antihypertensive medication was consistently associated with breast cancer risk. Results were similar when we considered hypertensive women only, and when we evaluated consistency and duration of medication use over time. Overall, antihypertensive medication use was largely unrelated to the risk of invasive breast cancer among women in the NHS cohorts.",

UUO was performed for 3 days (3UUO) and 7 days (7UUO) in C57BL/6 mice with or without aliskiren injection.

Aliskiren treatment was also associated with a reduced inflammatory response in obstructed kidneys of UUO mice. Aliskiren significantly decreased mRNA levels of several proinflammatory factors, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, seen in obstructed kidneys of UUO mice. Interestingly, mRNA and protein levels of the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome components apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2 were dramatically increased in obstructed kidneys of 7UUO mice, which were significantly suppressed by aliskiren. In primary cultured inner medullary collecting duct cells, IL-1\u03b2 significantly decreased AQP2 expression.

Etiological factors associated with autonomic neuropathy include insufficient glycemic control, a longer period since the onset of diabetes, increased age, female sex and greater body mass index. The most commonly used methods for the diagnosis of CAN are based upon the assessment of heart rate variability (the physiological variation in the time interval between heartbeats), as it is one of the first findings in both clinically asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Clinical symptoms associated with CAN generally occur late in the disease process and include early fatigue and exhaustion during exercise, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, presyncope and syncope.

The aims of this study were to determine TGF-\u03b21 levels in serum (s) and drained dialysate (dd), to assess their relations to sex, age, diabetes, dialysis modality, peritonitis and use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEi) and/or statins in 20 patients, 11 men and 9 women, mean age 62.90\u2009\u00b1\u200912.69 years, free of peritonitis during the first 6 months of PD treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in TGF-\u03b21 concentrations in serum and drained dialysate at the beginning and after first 6 months of chronic PD, in patients of different sex, age and diabetic patients versus non-diabetic. The significant positive correlations between sTGF-\u03b21 levels and glycemia at the beginning and cholesterolemia after 6 months of PD treatment suggest higher TGF-\u03b21 concentrations in patients with unfavorable metabolic profile. Expression of TGF-\u03b21 in effluent dialysate was significantly lower in patients on chronic PD using ACEi therapy, suggesting ACEi to have a protective effect on peritoneal membrane. Patients on ESA had slightly lower sTGF-\u03b21 concentrations after the first 6 months of PD treatment.",

Clinical studies have shown that ExT is a safe, effective, and inexpensive way to improve quality of life, work capacity, and longevity in patients with CHF. This review discusses the potential neural interactions between ANG II and sympatho-excitation in CHF and the modulation of this interaction by ExT. We briefly review the current understanding of the modulation of the angiotensin type 1 receptor in sympatho-excitatory areas of the brain and in the periphery (i.e., in the carotid body and skeletal muscle). We discuss possible cellular mechanisms by which ExT may impact the sympatho-excitatory process by reducing oxidative stress, increasing nitric oxide. and reducing ANG II. We also discuss the potential role of ACE2 and Ang 1-7 in the sympathetic response to ExT. Fruitful areas of further investigation are the role and mechanisms by which pre-sympathetic neuronal metabolic activity in response to individual bouts of exercise regulate redox mechanisms and discharge at rest in CHF and other sympatho-excitatory states.",

Munich Wistar Fr\u00f6mter (MWF) rats were used as a model of hypertension-related glomerular lesions. Young (9-week-old) MWF rats were nonproteinuric, similar to what was observed in control Wistar rats. However, urinary albumin excretion in the MWF rats gradually increased during aging, averaging 0.00062 \u00b1 0.0001 at age 9 weeks and 0.0054 \u00b1 0.0003 (mg/mOsmol per liter) at age 52 weeks (P < 0.0001). Albuminuria in aged MWF rats was accompanied by structural changes, which were indicative of glomerular lesions. The GSCA was low in young MWF rats but increased markedly during aging, averaging 0.00057 \u00b1 4.7 \u00d7 10(-5) (n = 25) in young MWF rats and 0.0027 \u00b1 0.00036 in 52-week-old MWF rats (n = 36; P < 0.0001). Treatment of proteinuric 12-month-old MWF rats with enalapril over a 4-week period reduced the GSCA from 0.0027 \u00b1 0.00036 to 0.00139 \u00b1 0.00013 (P = 0.0005). Similarly, urinary albumin excretion was reduced, averaging 0.0051 \u00b1 0.0003 and 0.0036 \u00b1 0.0005 mg/mOsmol per liter before and after enalapril administration, respectively (P = 0.0089).

    "249": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a dipeptidyl peptidase transmembrane bound enzyme. Generally, ACE inhibitors are used for the cardiovascular disorders. ACE inhibitors are primary agents for the management of hypertension, so these cannot be avoided for further use. The present Review focuses on the implications of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy. ACE inhibitors such as ramipril, captopril, perindopril, quinapril, lisinopril, enalapril, and trandolapril have been documented to ameliorate the above neurodegenerative disorders. Neurodegeneration occurs not only by angiotensin II, but also by other endogenous factors, such as the formation of free radicals, amyloid beta, immune reactions, and activation of calcium dependent enzymes. ACE inhibitors interact with the above cellular mechanisms. Thus, these may act as a promising factor for future medicine for neurological disorders beyond the cardiovascular actions. Central acting ACE inhibitors can be useful in the future for the management of neuropathic pain due to following actions: (i) ACE-2 converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin(1-7) (hepatapeptide) which produces neuroprotective action; (ii) ACE inhibitors downregulate kinin B1 receptors in the peripheral nervous system which is responsible for neuropathic pain. However, more extensive research is required in the field of neuropathic pain for the utilization of ACE inhibitors in human.", 
    "250": "Coronary artery ectasia (CAE) or aneurysm is usually defined as dilation \u22651.5-fold the normal vessel diameter. It has an incidence of 1.4-5.3% and is associated with a wide variety of etiologies-mainly congenital, atherosclerotic, and inflammatory ones. CAE is very common in sickle cell disease, and possibly sickle cell trait, with an incidence of 17.7%. It is likely related to the inflammatory process associated with hemoglobin S. Prognosis depends mainly on the underlying etiology. Atherosclerotic CAE does not carry additional risks compared to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (ACAD) without ectasia. However, isolated CAE in the absence of ACAD carries an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) due to vasospasm, slower coronary blood flow, and thrombosis, typically within the dilated segments. Due to lack of studies and guidelines, management recommendations are based on personal experiences. Therapy should be tailored to each individual case after assessment of severity, history of complications, underlying etiology, and comorbidities. Treatment of underlying condition and avoidance of exacerbating factors are essential. Medical therapy in general may include antiplatelets, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors statins, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. In severe CAE or history of MI, the addition of anticoagulation therapy after assessing bleeding risk may be warranted. In acute MI, the large thrombus burden in the dilated segment makes the percutaneous approach very challenging. Aspiration attempts can result in distal thromboembolization. Survival is better in bypass grafting than with medical therapy. Nonetheless, bypass grafting does not improve survival in atherosclerotic CAE. Depending on the physical characteristics of aneurysm, different surgical approaches can be sought; however, the ideal one is unclear.",

We demonstrated that incubation of H9c2 cells for 48 h with testosterone causes the apoptotic death of 60-70% of the cells and co-treatments with Eta, Los, or AC-DEVD-CHO reduced this effect. Testosterone also induces apoptosis (concentration dependent) and increases the proteolytic activity of Casp-3, which were reduced by co-treatments. TNF-\u03b1 and ACE activities were elevated by testosterone treatment, while co-treatment with Los and Eta reduced these effects. We concluded that an interaction between testosterone, angiotensin II, and TNF-\u03b1 induced apoptosis and Casp-3 activity in cultured cardiomyocytes, which contributed to the reduced viability of these cells induced by testosterone in toxic concentrations.",

To further mine the characterization of donkey milk, an extensive peptidomic study was performed. Two peptide purification strategies were compared to remove native proteins and lipids and enrich the peptide fraction. In one case the whole protein content was precipitated by organic solvent using cold acetone. In the other one the precipitation of the most abundant milk proteins, caseins, was performed under acidic conditions by acetic acid at pH4.6, instead. The procedures were compared and proved to be partially complementary. Considered together they provided 1330 peptide identifications for donkey milk, mainly coming from the most abundant proteins in milk. The bioactivity of the isolated peptides was also investigated, both by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant activity assays and by bioinformatics, proving that the isolated peptides did have the tested biological activities.", 
    "266": "The rationale behind this study is that peptides in food matrices often play an important biological role and, despite the extensive study of the protein composition of different samples, they remain poorly characterized. In fact, in a typical shotgun proteomics study endogenous peptides are not properly characterized. In proteomics workflows one limiting point is the isolation process: if it is specific for the purification of proteins, it often comprises a precipitation step which aims at isolating pure protein pellets and remove unwonted interferent compounds. In this way endogenous peptides, which are not effectively precipitated as well as proteins, are removed too and not analyzed at the end of the process. Moreover, endogenous peptides do often originate from precursor proteins, but in phenomena which are independent of the shotgun digestion protocol, thus they can be obtained from cleavage specificities other than trypsin's, which is the main proteolytic enzyme employed in proteomic experiments. For this reason, in the end, database search will not be effective for identification of these peptides, thus the need to provide different workflows for peptide analysis. In the work presented in this paper this issue is considered for the first time for the analysis of the peptides isolated in donkey milk samples, which have been chosen for its nutritional interest. This study provides additional knowledge on this milk, already characterized by traditional proteomics studies and peptidomic studies after simulated digestion. This type of study is not just a description of the naturally occurring peptidome of a sample, but also represents a starting point to discover and characterize those naturally occurring peptides responsible for the observed bioactivities of biological samples, as in the case of donkey milk, which would remain uncharacterized by other approaches. In this paper an analytical protocol was described for the efficient isolation and purification of peptides in donkey milk, assessing the effect of the purification protocol on the final identifications. Purified peptide samples were also checked to empirically elucidate any ACE inhibitory or antioxidant activity. Finally, the peptidomic results were also further mined by a bioinformatic-driven approach for bioactive peptide identification in the donkey milk samples. In our opinion, the main strengths of this study are related to the improved analytical workflow (either as purification protocol comparison or analytical platform development) which provides a high number of identified peptides, for which the biological significance as potential bioactive peptides has also been investigated.",

    "271": "No specific drugs are licensed for the treatment of ACE inhibitor (ACEI)-acquired angioedema (ACEI-AAE). Icatibant, an antagonist of the B2 receptor of bradykinin, is a potential treatment for this condition; however, its use in this setting is poorly documented. We report here clinical outcomes of 13 patients with ACEI-AAE treated with icatibant, in a real-life setting. Thirteen patients on ACEI seen in an Emergency Department (ED) with angioedema involving face, lips or the upper airways were analyzed. Angioedema due to known causes other than ACEI treatment was excluded. Initially, all patients received standard therapy (antihistamine, corticosteroids and epinephrine). Due to the lack of response and a worsening severity of symptoms, all patients received one subcutaneous injection of icatibant (30\u00a0mg/mL). Following icatibant treatment, all patients experienced improvement in the symptoms. The median time from onset of clinical symptoms to injection of icatibant was 3\u00a0h (IQR 2.5-5.5\u00a0h). Symptom relief was reported at 30\u00a0min (IQR 27.5-70\u00a0min). A complete resolution of symptoms was observed at 5\u00a0h (IQR 4-7\u00a0h). Ten patients had previously experienced angioedema attacks. The Median time to complete resolution of the previous attacks was higher (54\u00a0h; IQR 33-63\u00a0h), than after icatibant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) therapy. No patients required tracheal intubation or tracheotomy, and all patients were discharged within 24\u00a0h. No adverse events were reported. Before discharge, all patients were instructed to discontinue ACEI, and to take a different antihypertensive agent. This case series supports the efficacy of icatibant in improving symptoms of ACEI-AAE.", 
    "272": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates blood pressure homeostasis and vascular injury and repair responses. The RAAS was originally thought to be an endocrine system critically important in regulating blood pressure homeostasis. Yet, important local forms of the RAAS have been described in many tissues, which are mostly independent of the systemic RAAS. These systems have been associated with diverse physiological functions, but also with inflammation, fibrosis and target-organ damage. Pharmacological modulation of the RAAS has brought about important advances in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Yet, traditional RAAS blockers such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) only reduce the risk of disease progression in patients with established cardiovascular or renal disease by \u223c20% compared with other therapies. As more components of the RAAS are described, other potential therapeutic targets emerge, which could provide improved cardiovascular and renal protection beyond that provided by an ACE inhibitor or ARB. This Review summarizes the present and future pharmacological manipulation of this important system.", 
    "273": "Recent studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (Ang) -(1-7)/Mas axis activation is able to improve the metabolic profile, enhance glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, improve metabolic parameters, and counteract deleterious effects of Ang II. The effects of endogenous ACE 2 activation on the metabolic profile of mice are poorly studied. In this study, 12 weeks old male mice were treated with the ACE 2 activator (diminazene aceturate, DIZE, 1 mg/kg/day, gavage) or saline (control) for 30 days followed by glucose tolerance tests, insulin sensitivity tests, and blood analysis. Epididymal ACE2, ACE, angiotensinogen, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. ACE 2 activation treatment lowered body weight (DIZE vs control) (28.69 vs 30.28g, P < 0.001), serum cholesterol (140,0 vs 177.5; P < .05), and serum triglycerides (75,00 vs 165,0; P < .05) as well as epididymal (0.008 vs 0.016; P < .05) and retroperitoneal (0.0024 vs. 0.0068; P < .01) adipose tissue weights. These effects were associated with significantly increased epididymal ACE 2 and decreased ACE and angiotensinogen (AGT) expression. Additionally, DIZE decreased adipogenesis-related gene transcription, such as ACC and FAS mRNA. In conclusion, these results indicate that activation of ACE2 by oral DIZE treatment improves the metabolic profile and reduces fat deposition in mice. These results, along with the reduction of lipogenesis markers open a new perspective for metabolic disorder pharmacotherapy.",

Large-scale clinical trials had many faults, among them a lack of focus on the elderly. However, it would be difficult to conduct clinical trials of a similar scale in elderly CKD patients. Besides, progression of kidney disease is often slow in elderly persons, and the vast majority of older adults with CKD will die before reaching end stage renal disease. Moreover, since it is not clear that progression of kidney disease, and even of proteinuric diabetic nephropathy, is not inhibited through the use of RAS inhibitors, the most patient-centric goal of therapy for many elderly individuals should be individualized.",

These subtypes are believed to have different pathophysiological backgrounds and are referred to in recent guidelines as bradykinin-mediated (e.g. caused by angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors), mast cell-mediated (e.g. angioedema with wheals) or idiopathic (cause unknown). Bradykinin-mediated subtypes are more closely related to hereditary angioedema than the other forms. Because clinical features of these non-HAE subtypes have not been studied in detail, we have looked at the clinical characteristics of symptoms and potential differences in clinical presentation of bradykinin-mediated and mast cell-mediated angioedema (AE) subtypes.",

Most patients (62%) reported prodromal symptoms while 63% reported multiple locations for an attack. Face and oropharynx were the main locations of AE attacks of any subtype while swelling was the symptom most frequently reported as severe. Overall severity of the last attack was indicated as severe by 68% of the patients. There were no differences between the subgroups.",

Exercise has been shown to improve physical function, though response to exercise is variable. Conversely, drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathway, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are also reported to improve physical function. In the past decade, significant strides have been made to understand the complexity and specificity of the RAS system as it pertains to physical function in older adults. Prior findings have also determined that interactions between antihypertensive medications and exercise may influence physical function above and beyond either factor alone. We review the latest research on RAS, exercise, and physical function for older adults. We also outline future research aims in this area, including genetic influences and clinical phenotyping, for the purpose of maintaining or improving physical function through tailored treatments.",

To examine whether the effect is more immediate and independent of suppression of pathological remodelling, we tested the antiarrhythmic effect of short-term ACE inhibition in healthy normotensive rats. Wistar rats were administered with enalaprilat (ENA, i.p., 5 mg/kg every 12 h) or vehicle (CON) for 2 weeks. Intraarterial blood pressure in situ was measured in A. carotis. Cellular shortening was measured in isolated, electrically paced cardiomyocytes. Standard 12-lead electrocardiography was performed, and hearts of anaesthetized open-chest rats were subjected to 6-min ischemia followed by 10-min reperfusion to examine susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. Expressions of calcium-regulating proteins (SERCA2a, cardiac sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase; CSQ, calsequestrin; TRD, triadin; PLB, phospholamban; Thr(17)-PLB-phosphorylated PLB at threonine-17, FKBP12.6, FK506-binding protein, Cav1.2-voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel alpha 1C subunit) were measured by Western blot; mRNA levels of L-type calcium channel (Cacna1c), ryanodine receptor (Ryr2) and potassium channels Kcnh2 and Kcnq1 were measured by qRT-PCR. ENA decreased intraarterial systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure (by 20%, and by 31%, respectively, for both P < 0.05) but enhanced shortening of cardiomyocytes at basal conditions (by 34%, P < 0.05) and under beta-adrenergic stimulation (by 73%, P < 0.05). Enalaprilat shortened QTc interval duration (CON 78 \u00b1 1 ms vs. ENA 72 \u00b1 2 ms; P < 0.05) and significantly decreased the total duration of ventricular fibrillations (VF) and the number of VF episodes (P < 0.05). Reduction in arrhythmogenesis was associated with a pronounced upregulation of SERCA2a (CON 100 \u00b1 20 vs. ENA 304 \u00b1 13; P < 0.05) and complete absence of basal Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of PLB at Thr(17). Short-term ACEI treatment can provide protection against I/R injury-induced ventricular arrhythmias in healthy myocardium, and this effect is associated with increased SERCA2a expression.",

Renal biopsy indicated mild focal segmental mesangial proliferation with dominant mesangial IgA deposition on immunofluorescence. Electron microscopy showed marked proliferation of abnormal mitochondria in the proximal tubular cells. Enzyme activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and IV in cultured skin fibroblasts was significantly decreased. This case indicated the possible co-occurrence of IgAN and MD.

In patients with chronic HF, prevalence of DM is 24% compared with 40% in those hospitalized with worsening HF. Patients with concomitant HF and DM have diverse pathophysiologic, metabolic, and neurohormonal abnormalities that potentially contribute to worse outcomes than those without comorbid DM. In addition, although stable HF outpatients with DM show responses that are similar to those of patients without DM undergoing evidence-based therapies, it is unclear whether hospitalized HF patients with DM will respond similarly to novel investigational therapies. These data support the need to re-evaluate the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy of HF patients with concomitant DM. This paper discusses the role of DM in HF patients and underscores the potential need for the development of targeted therapies.",

Aromatic ketones were reduced to (R)-enantiomers, whereas keto esters were reduced to (S)-hydroxy esters with different enantioselectivities. The data indicate that GoKR does not obey Prelog's rule and exhibits anti-Prelog enantiopreference. Enzyme-substrate-cofactor docking analysis showed that hydride transfer occurred at the si faces of carbonyl group for ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE), which was then selectively reduced to the chiral (S)-alcohol.

The major findings were that ATP, ADP, and CD73 values were higher in atherosclerotic patients than in controls without clinically evident peripheral artery disease (P<0.0001). Low CD39 activity was associated with disease progression (P=0.01). In multivariable linear regression models, high CD73 activity was associated with chronic hypoxia (P=0.001).

However, it is not clear whether upregulation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis prevents LPS-induced injury in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) by inhibiting the MAPKs/NF-\u03baB pathways. Primary cultured rat PMVECs were transduced with lentiviral-borne Ace2 or shRNA-Ace2, and then treated or not with Mas receptor blocker (A779) before exposure to LPS. LPS stimulation resulted in the higher levels of AngII, Ang-(1-7), cytokine secretion, and apoptosis rates, and the lower ACE2/ACE ratio. Ace2 reversed the ACE2/ACE imbalance and increased Ang-(1-7) levels, thus reducing LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation, while inhibition of Ace2 reversed all these effects. A779 abolished these protective effects of Ace2. LPS treatment was associated with activation of the ERK, p38, JNK, and NF-\u03baB pathways, which were aggravated by A779. Pretreatment with A779 prevented the Ace2-induced blockade of p38, JNK, and NF-\u03baB phosphorylation. However, only JNK inhibitor markedly reduced apoptosis and cytokine secretion in PMVECs with Ace2 deletion and A779 pretreatment. These results suggest that the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis has a crucial role in preventing LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation of PMVECs, by inhibiting the JNK/NF-\u03baB pathways.", 
    "354": "The numbers of women of childbearing age with pregestational diabetes mellitus (diabetes existing before pregnancy) are increasing, primarily because more patients are developing type 2 diabetes at younger ages. The teratogenicity associated with hyperglycemia in early pregnancy is well documented, and tight glucose control minimizes the risk of congenital malformation. Preconception planning is essential; thus contraception that does not worsen complications of diabetes is desirable. In addition, because contraceptives are not 100% effective, the treatment of elevated blood glucose levels, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in these women requires consideration of unplanned pregnancy. We summarized the literature to aid clinicians in choosing individualized treatment that minimizes risk in case pregnancy occurs and maximizes benefit in preventing the complications of diabetes. In women with well-controlled diabetes without vascular disease, all contraceptive methods are safe. Intrauterine devices are recommended due to their minimal effects on risk factors for diabetic complications and their lack of reliance on patient adherence for efficacy. Among insulins, the insulin analogs-insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin detemir-offer patients greater convenience than regular insulin and NPH insulin, and they are safe in case of unplanned pregnancy. Of the noninsulin agents, glyburide and metformin are the safest during pregnancy, but many of the other agents pose minimal risk as long as they are withdrawn during early pregnancy. The risks and benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in women with compelling indications must be weighed individually. In hypertensive patients at a high risk for unplanned pregnancy, nifedipine should be considered due to literature supporting its safety during early pregnancy. Pravastatin is recommended for women with dyslipidemia who are using effective contraception because there have been no reports of birth defects with this statin when used during early pregnancy in humans and animals.",

Functional properties (water holding capacity: WHC, water solubility index: WSI, swelling capacity: SC, oil holding capacity: OHC, foaming, and emulsion properties) and ACE activities were also investigated using well-established procedures. The FT-IR spectra obtained for the CPWSP revealed two significant peaks, at about 3500 and 500 cm(-1), which corresponded to the carbohydrate region and were characteristic of polysaccharides. All spectra showed the presence of a broad absorption between 1500 and 670 cm(-1), which could be attributed to CH, CO, and OH bands in the polysaccharides. CPWSP had an XRD pattern that was typical for a semi-crystalline polymer with a major crystalline reflection at 19.6 \u00b0C. They also displayed important techno-functional properties (SWC, WSI, WHC, and OHC) that can be modulated according to temperature.

Multiple arrhythmic therapies that intervene by influencing cardiac sympathetic tone are common in clinical practice. These vary from pharmaceutical (\u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists) to percutaneous/surgical (cardiac sympathetic denervation) interventions. In some patients, however, these therapies have insufficient prophylactic and therapeutic capabilities. A safe and effective additional therapy wherein sympathetic drive is further attenuated would be expedient. Recently, renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) has been subject of research for various sympathetic nervous system-related diseases. By its presumed afferent and efferent sympatholytic effects, RSD might indirectly attenuate sympathetic outflow via the brain to the heart but might also reduce systemic catecholamine excretion and might therefore reduce catecholamine-sensitive arrhythmias. RSD is subject of research for various sympathetically driven arrhythmias, both supraventricular and ventricular. In this review, we give an overview of the rationale behind RSD as potential therapy in mediating arrhythmias that are triggered by a disrupted sympathetic nervous system and discuss the presently available results from animal and human studies.",

Silybum marianum had moderate pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibitory activities (30% at 100\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) whereas Cynara scolymus showed moderate ACE inhibitory activity (31% at 100\u00a0\u00b5g/ml). The combination had moderate to weak effects on the tested enzymes. In conclusion, our results indicate some moderate potential of the dietary supplement Boldocynara\u00ae and its single ingredients for the prevention of metabolic disorders.",

The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of ACEI or ARB use in dialysis patients. We performed a population-based cohort study with time-to-event analyses to estimate the relation between the use of ACEI/ARB and their outcomes. We used a nationwide database (Registry for Catastrophic Illnesses) for Taiwan, which has data from 1995 to 2008 nearly of all patients who received dialysis therapy. The records of all dialysis patients aged \u226518 with no evidence of cardiovascular (CV) events in 1997 and 1998 (133,564 patients) were examined. Users (n\u200a=\u200a50,961) and nonusers (n\u200a=\u200a59,913) of an ACEI/ARB were derived. We then used propensity score matching and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and CV events in users and nonusers of an ACRI/ARB. The 15,182 patients, who used an ACEI/ARB, and the 15,182 nonusers had comparable baseline characteristics during the 14 years of follow-up. The mortality was significantly greater in patients who did not use an ACEI/ARB (HR\u200a=\u200a0.90, 95% confidence interval\u200a=\u200a0.86-0.93). Subgroup analysis of 3 tertiles of patients who used different total amounts of ACEI/ARB during the study period indicated that CV events were more common in patients who used an ACEI/ARB for a short duration (tertile 1: HR\u200a=\u200a1.63), but less common in those who used an ACEI/ARB for long durations (tertile 2: HR\u200a=\u200a1.05; tertile 3: HR\u200a=\u200a0.94; trend for declining HR from tertile 1 to 3: P\u200a<\u200a0.001). The mortality benefit provided by use of an ACEI/ARB was consistent across most patient subgroups, as was the benefit of ARB monotherapy rather than ACEI monotherapy. Independent of traditional risk factors, overall mortality was significantly lower in dialysis patients who used an ACEI/ARB. In addition, subjects who used an ACEI/ARB for longer durations were significantly less likely to experience CV events.",

Risk factors include rapid skin thickening, use of certain medications such corticosteroids or cyclosporine, new-onset microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, cardiac complications (pericardial effusion, congestive heart failure, and/or arrhythmias), large joint contractures, and presence of anti-RNA polymerase III antibody. Since the 1970s, with the advent of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, mortality associated with SRC decreased from 76% to <10%.

Given its presence in patients with clinical evidence of chronic sun exposure and its histopathological finding of solar elastosis, acquired brachial cutaneous dyschromatosis is likely a disorder caused by cumulative UV damage.

Dual RAAS blockade may reduce residual proteinuria but without translating into improved cardiorenal outcomes at least in diabetic nephropathy; rather, dual RAAS blockade may increase the risk of adverse events. These findings have challenged the concept of residual proteinuria as an absolute treatment target. Therefore, new strategies must be explored to address whether by further reduction of residual proteinuria using interventions not primarily targeting the RAAS benefit in terms of cardiorenal risk reduction would accrue. Both clinical and experimental intervention studies have demonstrated that vitamin D can reduce residual proteinuria through both RAAS-dependent and RAAS-independent pathways. Future research should prospectively explore vitamin D treatment as an adjunct to RAAS blockade in an interventional trial exploring clinically relevant cardiorenal end points.",

The fetopathy induced by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is characterized by anuria, hypotension and growth restriction, but can also be associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. In the kidney, this fetopathy includes atrophy of the medulla, reduced number of glomeruli, developmental lesions of tubules and vessels, tubulointerstitial inflammation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Although angiotensin II (Ang II) inhibition during nephrogenesis interferes with normal growth and development, this review will focus on effects of the heavily accumulated matrix component hyaluronan (HA). An important mechanism of HA accumulation during nephrogenesis is disruption of its normal reduction as a consequence of lack of Ang II activation of hyaluronidase. Hyaluronan has very large water-attracting properties and is pro-inflammatory when fragmented. The ensuing inflammation and interstitial oedema affect kidney function. Hyaluronan is colocalized with CD44 overexpression and infiltrating immune cells. These properties make HA a plausible contributor to the observed structural and functional kidney defects associated with the fetopathy. Available data support an involvement of HA in kidney dysfunction of the foetus and during adulthood due to the physico-chemical characteristics of HA. No clinical treatment for HA accumulation exists. Treatment with the HA-degrading enzyme hyaluronidase and an HA synthesis inhibitor has been tested successfully in experimental models in the kidney, heart and pancreas. Reduced HA accumulation to reduce interstitial oedema and inflammation may improve organ function, but this concept needs to be tested in a controlled study before causal relationships can be established.",

Current standard treatment e.g. ACE-inhibitors like enalapril merely offers a delay in the progression leading to DN. Herein, we describe in two preclinical models evidence to local effects on the inflammatory signatures after intervention treatment with enalapril which provides enhanced understanding of the mechanism of ACE inhibitors. Enalapril transiently reduced albuminuria in both the db/db and the STZ-induced DN models with established disease, without modulating the HbA1c%. Albuminuria was strongly associated with loss of leukocytes, particularly B cells, but also of sub-populations of macrophages and CD4(+) T cells. The remaining kidney macrophages were polarized into a M2-like sub-population with reduced surface expression of the M1-like macrophage marker CD11c and enhanced expression of galectin-3. Enalapril treatment counteracted the reduction of leukocytes in the diabetic kidney towards levels noted in the non-diabetic kidney. Particularly, a subset of macrophages was increased and a clear expansion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was observed. However, enalapril failed to modulate the B cell compartment. Interestingly, enalapril treatment resulted in a re-polarization of the macrophages towards a M1-like phenotype characterized by elevated levels of CD11c with moderate down-regulation of the M2 marker galectin-3. The data demonstrate that ACE inhibition in pre-clinical models of DN shows a transient beneficial effect on albuminuria which is unexpectedly associated with restoration of T cells and M1-like macrophages in the kidney.",

IH is traditionally considered a tumor of the microvasculature. However, recent data show the critical role of stem cells in the biology of IH with emerging evidence suggesting an embryonic developmental anomaly due to aberrant proliferation and differentiation of a hemogenic endothelium with a neural crest phenotype that possesses the capacity for endothelial, hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and neuronal differentiation. Current evidence suggests a putative placental chorionic mesenchymal core cell embolic origin of IH during the first trimester. This review outlines the emerging role of stem cells and their interplay with the cytokine niche that promotes a post-natal environment conducive for vasculogenesis involving VEGFR-2 and its ligand VEGF-A and the IGF-2 ligand in promoting cellular proliferation, and the TRAIL-OPG anti-apoptotic pathway in preventing cellular apoptosis in IH. The discovery of the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the biology of IH provides a plausible explanation for the programed biologic behavior and the \u03b2-blocker-induced accelerated involution of this enigmatic condition. This crucially involves the vasoactive peptide, angiotensin II, that promotes cellular proliferation in IH predominantly via its action on the ATIIR2 isoform. The role of the RAS in the biology of IH is further supported by the effect of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, in inducing accelerated involution of IH. The discovery of the critical role of RAS in IH represents a novel and fascinating paradigm shift in the understanding of human development, IH, and other tumors in general.",

Secondary medical prevention therapies of same magnitude as that for coronary artery disease are recommended for peripheral arterial disease patients also. Available evidence indicates that this condition commonly remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. There is lack of any report about management of these patients in India. The objectives of the present study were to characterize the atherosclerotic risk factor profile and pattern of drug prescription for patients of peripheral arterial disease at a tertiary care teaching hospital and to compare this management with standard guidelines. Data were collected from prescriptions of patients attending cardiothoracic and vascular surgery outpatient department with diagnosis of atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease from July 2012 to Jun 2013. One hundred twenty prescriptions were analysed. The mean age (\u00b1SD) of patients was 53\u00b17.18 years and 23.3% were females. History of smoking, either past or present, was present in 91.6% patients. History of ischemic heart disease was present in 25%, while 26.7% patients were diabetic. Mean number of cardiovascular risk factors was 2.6. The percentage of eligible patients who were receiving a particular drug was 100% for aspirin and statins, 48.3% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 46.7% for beta blockers and 66.7% for cilostazol.

Secondary prevention with aspirin and beta-blockers at 80% coverage (and at lower rates) would be highly cost-effective, and the addition of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors would also be cost-effective. Introducing the polypill dominates a strategy of a 4-drug regimen with the aforementioned drugs and statins.

    "489": "The novel function of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is cardiovascular homeostasis. While the major active mediator angiotensin II (ANG II) produces most of the physiologic responses via angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), recent insights have looked at the implications of ANG II and its impact on solid tumor formation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the direct effect of ANG II on the stimulation of angiogenesis via VEGF and other proliferative mediators. RAS components have thus been identified in numerous malignant tissues. Inhibition of the AT1R via angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) has demonstrated a decrease in solid tumor development and metastasis. Numerous retrospective analyses have demonstrated a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence, polyp formation, and distant metastasis in patients taking inhibitors of the RAS. The use of commonly prescribed anti-hypertensive medications as a chemo-preventative medication may have a remarkable impact in the colorectal cancer community. Further investigation and prospective clinical trials may provide further insight into the potentially beneficial use of ACE-Is and their impact on colorectal cancer.",

The starting points for these pathways are different--risk factors or aortic ageing--but they conclude in the same way: end-stage heart disease. Together these interlinked pathways form the extended cardiovascular continuum. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors have been shown to interrupt or slow the progression of cardiovascular disease along one pathway, the cardiovascular atherosclerotic continuum. Cardiovascular protection with RAAS inhibitors varies; different RAAS inhibitors offer different levels of protection. Similarly, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) also have clearly shown protective effect of cardiovascular system, especially as it regards cerebrovascular disease risk. The AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) showed that a combination of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril and CCB amlodipine offered better cardiovascular protection in at-risk hypertensive patients than beta-blocker and thiazide. By attenuating the deleterious effects of cardiovascular disease at multiple stages of the extended cardiovascular continuum on top of lowering blood pressure (BP), perindopril and amlodipine could interrupt and slow the progression of cardiovascular disease. These antihypertensive agents have complementary vascular effects that enhance cardiovascular protection and reduce side-effects. Evidence from ASCOT shows that antihypertensive and vascular effects of amlodipine with and without perindopril have translated into real-life clinical benefits. A strategy using ACE inhibitors and CCBs, such as perindopril and amlodipine, to target multiple stages in both pathways of cardiovascular disease could effectively reduce cardiovascular risk and lower BP.",

SBP and HR were measured over 10.7\u00b12.2 (mean\u00b1SD) visits. Mean SBP, mean HR, and SBP-CV were associated with cognitive decline, dysfunction, and deterioration (all P<0.01, unadjusted). After adjustment, only SBP-CV (P=0.0030) and mean HR (P=0.0008) remained predictors for cognitive dysfunction (odds ratios [95% confidence intervals], 1.32 [1.10-1.58] for 5th versus 1st quintile of SBP-CV and 1.40 [1.18-1.66] for 5th versus 1st quintile of mean HR). Similar effects were observed for cognitive decline and deterioration. SBP-CV and mean HR showed additive effects. In conclusion, SBP-CV and mean HR are independent predictors of cognitive decline and cognitive dysfunction in patients at high CV risk.",

    "529": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a membrane-bound zinc metallopeptidase, catalyzes the formation of Angiotensin-II (AngII) and the deactivation of bradykinin in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and kallikrein-kinin systems. As a hydrolysis product of ACE, AngII is regarded as an inhibitor and displays stronger competitive inhibition in the C-domain than the N-domain of ACE. However, the AngII binding differences between the two domains and the mechanisms behind AngII dissociation from the C-domain are rarely explored. In this work, molecular docking, Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area calculation, and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) are applied to explore the structures and interactions in the binding or unbinding of AngII with the two domains of human somatic ACE. Calculated free energy values suggest that the C-domain-AngII complex is more stable than the N-domain-AngII complex, consistent with available experimental data. SMD simulation results imply that electrostatic interaction is dominant in the dissociation of AngII from the C-domain. Moreover, Gln106, Asp121, Glu123, and Tyr213 may be the key residues in the unbinding pathway of AngII. The simulation results in our work provide insights into the interactions between the two domains of ACE and its natural peptide inhibitor AngII at a molecular level. Moreover, the results provide theoretical clues for the design of new inhibitors.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II AT-1 receptor antagonists (also known as sartans or ARBs) are potent modulators of these systems and are highly effective as first-line treatments for hypertension, diabetic nephropathies, and diseases of the brain and coronary arteries. However, these agents are mechanistically distinct and should not be considered interchangeable. In this mini-review, we provide novel insights into the often neglected roles of the KKS in the beneficial, protective, and reparative actions of ACEIs.

Partial abdominal aortic ligation was carried out in Sprague-Dawley rats. Angiotensin AT1 receptor blockade and ACE inhibition were achieved by losartan and enalapril treatment, respectively. Results showed that aortic constriction increased left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma renin activity (PRA) and cardiac ACE levels, but decreased the expression of cardiac ACE2 and Mas receptor. Losartan treatment significantly decreased MAP, left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH), fibrosis, and increased cardiac ACE2 and Mas expression. Enalapril also improved the cardiac parameters with a rise in cardiac ACE2, but did not change the Mas level. In conclusion, aortic constriction results in cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and a rise of cardiac ACE expression. Both AT1 receptor blocker and ACE inhibitor play a cardioprotective role in aortic constriction. However, AT1 receptor blocker particularly promotes cardiac ACE2 and Mas receptor levels.

The study aimed to explore associations between perinatal outcomes and maternal exposure to drugs for chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, and autoimmune disease.We reviewed 521 cases of adverse reactions due to drug exposure during pregnancy who were reported to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, a regulatory authority in Japan. The primary outcomes were fetal and neonatal death and malformation of infants. Associations between perinatal outcomes and exposure to each drug category for hypertension, diabetes, and autoimmune disease were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.Of the 521 cases (maternal age: 15-47 years; mean 32.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a5.5), fetal and neonatal deaths were reported in 159 cases (130 miscarriage; 12 stillbirth; 4, neonatal death; and 13 abortion due to medical reasons), and malformations of infants were observed in 124 cases. In contrast to the trend of association between diabetes with or without medication and fetal and neonatal death (odds ratio [OR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-1.36), exposure to oral antidiabetics tended to be associated with fetal and neonatal death (OR, 4.86; 95% CI, 0.81-29.2). Malformation tended to be correlated with exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 0.76-11.7). This association showed trends opposite to that of the association with hypertension itself (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18-1.02) or overall antihypertensives (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.15-1.13). Occurrence of multiple malformations was associated with exposure to biologics (OR, 8.46; 95% CI, 1.40-51.1), whereas there was no significant association between multiple malformations and autoimmune disease with or without medication (OR 1.07; 95% CI, 0.37-3.06).These findings suggest that drugs of different categories may have undesirable effects when used during pregnancy.

    "576": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is an enzymatic cascade functioning in a paracrine and autocrine fashion. In animals and humans, RAAS intrinsic to tissues modulates food intake, metabolic rate, adiposity, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. A large array of observations shows that dysregulation of RAAS in the metabolic syndrome favors type 2 diabetes. Remarkably, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, suppressing the synthesis of angiotensin II (ANG II), and angiotensin receptor blockers, targeting the ANG II type 1 receptor, prevent diabetes in patients with hypertensive or ischemic cardiopathy. These drugs interrupt the negative feedback loop of ANG II on the RAAS cascade, which results in increased production of angiotensins. In addition, they change the tissue expression of RAAS components. Therefore, the concept of a dual axis of RAAS regarding glucose homeostasis has emerged. The RAAS deleterious axis increases the production of inflammatory cytokines and raises oxidative stress, exacerbating the insulin resistance and decreasing insulin secretion. The beneficial axis promotes adipogenesis, blocks the production of inflammatory cytokines, and lowers oxidative stress, thereby improving insulin sensitivity and secretion. Currently, drugs targeting RAAS are not given for the purpose of preventing diabetes in humans. However, we anticipate that in the near future the discovery of novel means to modulate the RAAS beneficial axis will result in a decisive therapeutic breakthrough.",

    "581": "In adults, membranous nephropathy (MN) is a major cause of nephrotic syndrome. However, the etiology of approximately 75% of MN cases is idiopathic. Secondary causes of MN are autoimmune diseases, infection, drugs, and malignancy. The pathogenesis of MN involves formation of immune complex in subepithelial sites, but the definite mechanism is still unknown. There are three hypotheses about the formation of immune complex, including preformed immune complex, in situ immune-complex formation, and autoantibody against podocyte membrane antigen. The formation of immune complex initiates complement activation, which subsequently leads to glomerular damage. Recently, the antiphospholipase A2 receptor antibody was found to be associated with idiopathic MN. This finding may be useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of MN. The current treatment includes best supportive care, which consists of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, lipid-lowering agents, and optimal control of blood pressure. Immunosuppressive agents should be used for patients who suffer from refractory proteinuria or complications associated with nephrotic syndrome. Existing evidence supports the use of a combination of steroid and alkylating agents. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and the treatment of MN.",

    "587": "On the basis of strong research evidence, the prevalence of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is decreasing worldwide, although it still remains the leading cause of glomerulonephritis in children. The overall decrease in prevalence of PSGN has been mainly driven by a significant decrease in pyoderma seen in the last half-century, such that postpharyngitic PSGN is most commonly seen in developed nations. On the basis of primarily consensus because of a lack of relevant clinical studies, the latency period between streptococcal infection and the development of nephritis is a hallmark of PSGN, with this period lasting 1 to 2 weeks with pharyngeal infections or 2 to 6 weeks with skin infections. Concurrent infectious and nephritis symptoms should elicit further suspicion of other causes of glomerulonephritis. On the basis of expert opinion, PSGN is one of a handful of nephritic disorders with hypocomplementemia (low C3 level). The decrease in C3 is found in more than 90% of PSGN cases and is typically seen earlier than an increase in antistreptolysin O titers. Measuring C3 and C4 may also be helpful in the evaluation of other causes of acute nephritis. On the basis of primarily consensus because of a lack of relevantclinical studies, the main sequelae of PSGN (hypertension, edema,gross hematuria, and impaired renal function) are greatest in thefirst 7 to 10 days of disease. Therefore, this period requires themost vigilance for adverse effects. On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, the most effective treatment of hypertension and edema in PSGN is loop or thiazide diuretics, which may also address hyperkalemia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may be effective in hypertension control but carry the risk of hyperkalemia and temporarily impairing recovery of renal function. On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, the prognosis for PSGN, even long term, is good. Despite being the most prevalent of the childhood glomerulonephritides, it often does not cause chronic kidney disease, but persistent microscopic hematuria and proteinuria may be seen in less than 10% of patients.",

Griess reagent method was applied to measure NO contents in cell culture supernatant, RT-PCR to detect the expression of eNOSmRNA in HUVEC, and Western blot to detect the expression of eNOS and phosphorylated eNOS. In Ang II intervention group, NO contents were significantly lower than control group (P < 0.05). Through rhACE2 treatment, the NO contents in cell culture medium and the expression level of phosphorylated eNOS were significantly higher than in Ang II intervention group (P < 0.05), but eNOSmRNA and non-phosphorylated eNOS protein expression level showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). After HUVEC was intervened by PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002, the expression level of phosphorylated eNOS was significantly lower than that in the rhACE2 30 min treatment group (P < 0.05). rhACE2 may reduce the activity of Ang II inhibited endothelial cell eNOS, which can be blocked by PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002, suggesting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays an important role in rhACE2's promotion of the activity of endothelial cell eNOS.",

Various pathophysiologic mechanisms underlie cardiorenal syndrome including hemodynamic derangements, reduced cardiac output leading to impaired renal perfusion, reduced stroke volume, raised atrial filling pressures, elevated atrial pressures, sodium and water retention, venous congestion, right ventricular dysfunction and venous hypertension causing increased renal venous pressure, intra-abdominal hypertension, various neurohormonal adaptations including activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, adaptive activation of the sympathetic nervous system, cytokine release and oxidative stress. Although there are standardized clinical guidelines for the management of heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, respectively, there are no similar consensus clinical guidelines for the management of the cardiorenal syndromes. RAAS inhibition is advocated in treating systolic heart failure. There is evidence that RAAS inhibition is also useful in cardiorenal syndrome. However, RAAS inhibition, while potentially useful in the management of cardiorenal syndrome, is not the 'magic bullet', is sometimes limited by adverse renal events, is not applicable to all patients, and must be applied by physicians with due diligence and caution. Nevertheless, a more comprehensive multidisciplinary multipronged approach to managing patients with cardiorenal syndrome is even more pragmatic and commonsense given the multiple mechanisms and pathogenetic pathways implicated in the causation and perpetuation of cardiorenal syndrome.",

    "619": "Capecitabine is an orally administered chemotherapeutic agent that is metabolized at the tumor site to 5-fluorouracil and thought to be without significant cardiac toxicity. We report a rare case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy that is thought to be related to capecitabine where the patient presented with chest pain, and ST elevation within 48 hours of capecitabine therapy. Workup included cardiac catheterization and coronary angiogram that showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease and anteroapical left ventricular wall motion abnormality with left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. The drug was stopped, and the patient was treated with beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitor. Six weeks later, she had a repeat echocardiogram that was normal. Capecitabine-related cardiomyopathy seems to be very rare because only 5 cases have been reported in the literature (including our case). The condition has to be anticipated and treated to prevent the serious consequence of cardiac dysfunction. All reported cases have eventually recovered after stopping capecitabine.", 
    "620": "There is growing interest in using functional foods or nutraceuticals for the prevention and treatment of hypertension or high blood pressure. Although numerous preventive and therapeutic pharmacological interventions are available on the market, unfortunately, many patients still suffer from poorly controlled hypertension. Furthermore, most pharmacological drugs, such as inhibitors of angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE), are often associated with significant adverse effects. Many bioactive food compounds have been characterized over the past decades that may contribute to the management of hypertension; for example, bioactive peptides derived from various food proteins with antihypertensive properties have gained a great deal of attention. Some of these peptides have exhibited potent in vivo antihypertensive activity in both animal models and human clinical trials. This review provides an overview about the complex pathophysiology of hypertension and demonstrates the potential roles of food derived bioactive peptides as viable interventions targeting specific pathways involved in this disease process. This review offers a comprehensive guide for understanding and utilizing the molecular mechanisms of antihypertensive actions of food protein derived peptides.",

Rats were randomly divided into five groups as: sham (sham operated, n\u2009=\u20097); vehicle group 1 (torsion-detorsion, n\u2009=\u20097) with 2\u2009h ischemia and 2\u2009h reperfusion; vehicle group 2 (torsion-detorsion, n\u2009=\u20097) with 2\u2009h ischemia and 5 days' reperfusion; zofenopril group 1 (torsion-detorsion, n\u2009=\u20097) with 2\u2009h ischemia, 2\u2009h reperfusion and a signal dose of oral 15\u2009mg/kg zofenopril; and zofenopril group 2 (torsion-detorsion, n\u2009=\u20097) with 2\u2009h ischemia, 5 days' reperfusion and 5 days' oral 15\u2009mg/kg zofenopril. A scoring of histopathologic evaluation was performed on the ovaries according to congestion, bleeding, edema, and cellular degeneration. Biochemical assessments included catalase, tissue malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl.",

    "625": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the mainstay of treatment for diabetic nephropathy to slow progression of disease. Diabetic women of childbearing age with nephropathy should be treated with ACE inhibitors as per guidelines in the pre-pregnancy period. ACE inhibitor use and exposure in the first trimester is controversial and requires counselling pre-pregnancy regarding the risks and benefits of use up to the first trimester, as well as the need to stop ACE inhibitors prior to the second trimester. Current evidence does not suggest that ACE inhibitors in the first trimester are associated with a greater risk of fetal malformations when compared to other antihypertensives. This topic is reviewed in depth, along with blood pressure targets in pregnant women with diabetic proteinuric disease, evidence for prevention of pre-eclampsia, self-monitoring of blood pressures at home in the latter half of pregnancy and the signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia, proteinuria evolution in pregnancy, renal function prognosis, and restarting ACE inhibitors when breast feeding in the post-partum period.", 
    "626": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a well-known metallopeptidase that is found in vertebrates, invertebrates and bacteria. We isolated from the anterior gill of the crab Ucides cordatus an isoform of ACE, here named crab-ACE, which presented catalytic properties closely resembling to those of mammalian ACE. The enzyme was purified on Sepharose-lisinopril affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity and a band of about 72 kDa could be visualized after silver staining and Western blotting. Assays performed with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) selective ACE substrates Abz-FRK(Dnp)P-OH, Abz-SDK(Dnp)P-OH and Abz-LFK(Dnp)-OH, allowed us to verify that crab-ACE has hydrolytic profile very similar to that of the ACE C-domain. In addition, we observed that crab-ACE can hydrolyze the ACE substrates, angiotensin I and bradykinin. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by the specific ACE inhibitor lisinopril (Ki of 1.26 nM). However, in contrast to other ACE isoforms, crab-ACE presented a very particular optimum pH, being the substrate Abz-FRK(Dnp)-P-OH hydrolyzed efficiently at pH 9.5. Other interesting characteristic of crab-ACE was that the maximum hydrolytic activity was reached at around 45\u00b0C. The description of an ACE isoform in Ucides cordatus is challenging and may contribute to a better understanding of the biochemical function of this enzyme in invertebrates.",

Protein contents of NBM significantly reduced when treated with L. bulgaricus and L. plantarum B1-6, and the electrophoresis patterns showed the preferable proteins for LAB strains to hydrolyze were \u03b1- and \u03b2-type phaseolins, whereas \u03b3-type phaseolin was resistant to hydrolysis. RP-HPLC analysis demonstrated all fermented NBM had higher intensities of peaks with retention times between 2.5 and 3.5 min indicative of formation of small peptides. All fermented NBM showed higher ACE inhibitory activity compared to the unfermented ones, for which 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h were found to be the optimum fermentation periods for respectively L. plantarum 70810, L. plantarum B1-6 and L. bulgaricus, with IC50 values of 109 \u00b1 5.1, 108 \u00b1 1.1, and 101 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcg protein ml(-1).

To investigate in human intestine the potential effect of ACEIs or ARBs on ACE2, we analysed intestinal biopsies taken during routine gastroduodenoscopy and ileocolonoscopy from 46 patients of which 9 were under ACEI and 13 ARB treatment. Analysis of transcript expression by real-time PCR and of proteins by immunofluorescence showed a co-localization of SIT1 and B(0)AT1 with ACE2 in the brush-border membrane of human small intestine enterocytes and a distinct axial expression pattern of the tested gene products along the intestine. Patients treated with ACEIs displayed in comparison with untreated controls increased intestinal mRNA levels of ACE2, peptide transporter PEPT1 (SLC15A1) and AA transporters B(0)AT1 and PAT1 (SLC36A1).

Consistently, in humans, a multidrug individually tailored antiproteinuric treatment based on combination therapy with maximum tolerated doses of ACEi and ARB (Remission Clinic protocol) reduced proteinuria and prevented end-stage renal disease (ESRD) more effectively than ACEi/ARB monotherapy, in particular in subjects with non-diabetic CKD. Fixed doses of an ACEi or renin inhibitor added to losartan failed to exert any additional renoprotective effect as compared with losartan monotherapy in patients at increased cardiovascular risk (ONTARGET study) or with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy (ALTITUDE study). The VA NEPHRON D study found that losartan and lisinopril combination therapy reduced by 34% the risk of predefined reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate, ESRD or death as compared to losartan in 1,448 type 2 diabetes patients with overt nephropathy. Unfortunately, the treatment effect failed to achieve the nominal significance (p = 0.07) because of premature trial interruption. Thus, the Remission Clinic protocol is the most powerful tool to prevent progression to ESRD in non-diabetic proteinuric CKD. Results of the ongoing VALID trial will show whether this approach can be safely extended to type 2 diabetes patients.",

The Alcalase/protease gelatin hydrolysate below 1 kDa (SAP) exhibited the highest angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition compared to other hydrolysates. SAP can decrease systolic blood pressure significantly in spontaneously hypertensive rats. SAP inhibited vasoconstriction via PPAR-\u03b3 expression, activation and phosphorylation of eNOS in lungs. Moreover, the expression levels of endothelin-1, RhoA, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, cleaved caspase 3 and MAPK were decreased by SAP in lungs. Vascularity, muscularization and cellular proliferation in lungs were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Finally, two purified peptides (LGPLGHQ, 720Da and MVGSAPGVL, 829Da) showed potent ACE inhibition with IC50 values of 4.22 and 3.09 \u03bcM, respectively.

The Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living With Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial showed that the combination of benazepril+amlodipine (B+A) is superior to benazepril+hydrochlorothiazide (B+H) in reducing CV events. We aimed to investigate whether the treatment effects in the ACCOMPLISH trial were dependent on baseline PP. High-risk hypertensive patients (n=11,499) were randomized to double-blinded treatment with single-pill combinations of either B+A or B+H and followed for 36 months. Patients were divided into tertiles according to their baseline PP and events (CV mortality/myocardial infarction or stroke) were compared. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the treatment effect (B+A over B+H) were calculated in a Cox regression model with age, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus as covariates and were compared across the tertiles. The event rate was increased in the high tertile of PP compared with the low tertile (7.2% vs 4.4% P<.01). In the high and medium PP tertiles, HRs were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.95; P=.018) and 0.74 (CI, 0.56-0.98, P=.034), respectively, in favor of B+A. There was no significant difference between the treatments in the low tertile and no significant differences in treatment effect when comparing the HRs between tertiles of PP. B+A has superior CV protection over B+H in high-risk hypertensive patients independent of baseline PP although the absolute treatment effect is enhanced in the higher tertiles of PP where event rates are higher.",

We hypothesized that the effect of ACE gene I/D polymorphism on mortality may be influenced by concurrent ACE inhibitor therapy in this population. In this prospective, multicenter cohort, observational study, data was collected from 716 prevalent chronic hemodialysis patients, blood samples were genotyped for I/D single nucleotide polymorphism. Patient mortality was assessed in tree genotype groups insertion/insertion, insertion/deletion and deletion/deletion (I/I, I/D, and D/D) using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. The most frequent genotype was I/D (42.6%), followed by D/D (37.7%) and I/I (19.7%) genotypes. The mean age was 54.9\u00b115.5 years, 53.2% of all patients were male and in the total group the prevalence of diabetes was 19.3%. ACE inhibitor therapy was prescribed for 47.9% of all patients. The median duration of dialysis before blood sampling was 23.8 months (IQR 11.2-47.1). Patients were followed for 10 years, the median follow-up time was 29.8 months (IQR 12.6-63.4). Patient characteristics were well balanced among the genotype groups. D/D genotype, was associated with inferior survival (I/I vs D/D: log-rank test: P=0.04) in patients not receiving ACE inhibitor therapy, and the presence of this therapy diminished this difference. There was no difference in survival among unselected patients with different genotypes. In multivariate Cox regression models, D/D genotype (compared to I/I) was a significant predictor of mortality only in patients without ACE inhibitor therapy (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.97, P=0.03). Our data suggests that hemodialyzed patients with the deletion/deletion (D/D) genotype might have inferior outcome, and ACE inhibitor therapy may be associated with improved survival in this subgroup.",

A number of rare mutations linked to familial AD (FAD) on the A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP), Presenilin-1 (PS1), Presenilin- 2 (PS2), Adamalysin10, and other genetic risk factors for sporadic AD such as the \u03b54 allele of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE-\u03b54) foster the accumulation of A\u03b2 and also induce the entire spectrum of pathology associated with the disease. A\u03b2 accumulation is therefore a key pathological event and a prime target for the prevention and treatment of AD. APP is sequentially processed by \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, a multisubunit PS1/PS2-containing integral membrane protease, to generate A\u03b2. Although A\u03b2 accumulates in all forms of AD, the only pathways known to be affected in FAD increase A\u03b2 production by APP gene duplication or via base substitutions on APP and \u03b3-secretase subunits PS1 and PS2 that either specifically increase the yield of the longer A\u03b242 or both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. However, the vast majority of AD patients accumulate A\u03b2 without these known mutations. This led to proposals that impairment of A\u03b2 degradation or clearance may play a key role in AD pathogenesis. Several candidate enzymes, including Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), Neprilysin (NEP), Endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), Plasmin, and Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been identified and some have even been successfully evaluated in animal models. Several studies also have demonstrated the capacity of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors to paradoxically increase the yield of A\u03b2 and we have recently established that the mechanism is by skirting A\u03b2 degradation. This review outlines major cellular pathways of A\u03b2 degradation to provide a basis for future efforts to fully characterize the panel of pathways responsible for A\u03b2 turnover.",

We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to <2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (>3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is <30mL/min/1.73m(2). We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73m(2)) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is <30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.",

Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors and affects nearly every major aspect of cancer biology. Previous studies have shown that hypoxia can regulate RAS expression in somatic tissues and cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of hypoxia on local RAS expression in mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. For hypoxia treatment, LLC cells were cultured in a hypoxia incubator or treated with hypoxia-mimetic cobalt chloride. Hypoxia up-regulated angiotensin II, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), and down-regulated ACE2 and angiotensin II type 2 receptor in LLC cells. Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, and losartan, an AT1R blocker, decreased expression of ACE and AT1R, but increased expression of ACE2 and angiotensin II type 2 receptor in LLC cells under hypoxia. Captopril and losartan also suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor-A expression in LLC cells under hypoxia. These findings suggest that hypoxia induces dysregulation of local RAS in LLC cells. The pathophysiological importance of hypoxia-induced RAS dysregulation and potentially therapeutic effects of RAS inhibitors on hypoxic tumor cells should be further examined.",

This study investigated carrier status for insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in introne 16 of ACE gene in 71 women with two or more pregnancy loss in preplacentation period (between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation) and 75 women without pregnancy complications. DD genotype for I/D polymorphism was found respectively in 31% and 24% in patients and controls. Heterozygosity of D allele was found correspondingly in 47.9% and 54.7%. The dominant genetic model was used for allele prevalence comparison. D allele in DD genotype was not significantly prevalent in women with early pregnancy wastage compared with the control subjects, OR = 1.42, 95% CI (0.64-3.15). The study found a weak association between I/D polymorphism and preplacentation pregnancy loss. The additive effect over the pregnancy loss risk of I/D polymorphism could be supposed in a presence of other inherited or acquired factors connected with endometrial receptivity and implantation process.", 
    "731": "Apart from the well-documented role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in regulating the blood pressure and other related parameters, its role in modulating different physiological/pathological functions, including pain, has also been described. Like its dual role in regulating stress-related anxiety and cognitive functions, its dual role has also been documented in pain modulation in different disease states. Drugs blocking the RAAS activation, viz., renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, AT(1) receptor antagonists and aldosterone antagonists, have been shown to produce beneficial effects in migraine and neuropathic and nociceptive pain. Their beneficial effects have been mainly attributed to inhibition of the inflammatory cascade of reactions by inhibiting the generation of key cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. On the contrary, clinical as well as preclinical studies have also shown the pain-inducing actions of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocking drugs. Furthermore, the pain-relieving actions of angiotensin II (AngII) and pain-inducing actions of AT(1) blockers have also been described. The pain-inducing actions of ACE inhibitors have been mainly attributed to interference with metabolism of bradykinin and substance P, while the analgesic actions of AngII have been mainly related to activation of brain localized AT(2) receptors and release of endogenous opioids. The present review describes the dual role of the RAAS in different states of pain.", 
    "732": "Vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists (VDRAs) are commonly used to manage hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with CKD experience extremely high risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Clinical observations show that VDRA therapy may be associated with cardio-renal protective and survival benefits in patients with CKD. The 5/6 nephrectomized (NX) Sprague-Dawley rat with established uremia exhibits elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), hypertension, and abnormal cardiac function. Treatment of 5/6 NX rats with VS-105, a novel VDRA (0.05 and 0.5 \u03bcg/kg po by gavage), once daily for 8 wk in the presence or absence of enalapril (30 mg/kg po via drinking water) effectively suppressed serum PTH without raising serum calcium. VS-105 alone reduced systolic blood pressure (from 174 \u00b1 6 to 145 \u00b1 9 mmHg, P < 0.05) as effectively as enalapril (from 174 \u00b1 6 to 144 \u00b1 7 mmHg, P < 0.05). VS-105 improved cardiac functional parameters such as E/A ratio, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening with or without enalapril. Enalapril or VS-105 alone significantly reduced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH); VS-105 plus enalapril did not further reduce LVH. VS-105 significantly reduced both cardiac and renal fibrosis. The lack of hypercalcemic toxicity of VS-105 is due to its lack of effects on stimulating intestinal calcium transport and inducing the expression of intestinal calcium transporter genes such as Calb3 and TRPV6. These studies demonstrate that VS-105 is a novel VDRA that may provide cardiovascular benefits via VDR activation. Clinical studies are required to confirm the cardiovascular benefits of VS-105 in CKD.", 
    "733": "Cardiac ischaemia and reperfusion leads to irreversible injury and subsequent tissue remodelling. Initial reperfusion seems to shift arginine metabolism from nitric oxide (NO) to polyamine formation. This may limit functional recovery at reperfusion. The hypothesis was tested whether ischaemia/reperfusion translates such a shift in arginine metabolism in a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-dependent way and renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-dependent way into a sustained effect. Both, the early post-ischaemic recovery and molecular adaptation to ischaemia/reperfusion were analysed in saline perfused rat hearts undergoing global no-flow ischaemia and reperfusion. Local TNF-\u03b1 activation was blocked by inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 sheddase ADAM17. To interfere with RAS captopril was administered. Arginase was inhibited by administration of Nor-NOHA. Long-term effects of ischemia/reperfusion on arginine metabolism were analysed in vivo in rats receiving an established ischaemia/reperfusion protocol in the closed chest mode. mRNA expression analysis indicated a shift in the arginine metabolism from NO formation to polyamine metabolism starting within 2 hours (h) of reperfusion and translated into protein expression within 24 h. Inhibition of the TNF-\u03b1 pathway and captopril attenuated these delayed effects on post-ischaemic recovery. This shift in arginine metabolism was associated with functional impairment of hearts within 24 h. Inhibition of arginase but not that of TNF-\u03b1 and RAS pathways improved functional recovery immediately. However, no benefit was observed after four months. In conclusion, this study identified TNF-\u03b1 and RAS to be responsible for depressed cardiac function that occurred a few hours after reperfusion.",

Carboxylesterases (CESs), with the main isoforms CES1 and CES2, are important in the metabolism of ester-type prodrugs. However, influences of immunological liver injury on the activity of CES remain undefined. In the present study, we demonstrated treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) suppressed the activities of CES1 and CES2. The decreased activities of CES1 and CES2 were preliminarily assessed by the hydrolysis assay for their common substrate p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA) with rat hepatic microsomal enzyme. Subsequently, RT-PCR results showed that the levels of CES1 mRNA and mRNA of CES2 (AB010635) and CES2 (AY034877) in the model group were significantly lower than those of the normal control group (P<0.05). Western blot results showed that the expressions of CES1 and CES2 proteins were decreased (P<0.05). To further clarify the effects of LPS on the metabolic activities of CESs, pharmacokinetic studies were performed in rats by utilizing imidapril and irinotecan (CPT-11) as the specific substrates for CES1 and CES2, respectively. After treatment with LPS, AUC0-\u221e and Cmax of imidaprilat were decreased from 2084.86\u00b1340.66ng\u00b7h(-1)\u00b7mL(-1) and 234.66\u00b168.85ng\u00b7mL(-1) to 983.87\u00b1315.34ng\u00b7h(-1)\u00b7mL(-1) and 113.1\u00b119.69ng\u00b7mL(-1) (P<0.05), respectively.

Angiotensinogen, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE)-1, ACE-2, angiotensin type 1a and type 1b receptors, and vasopressin (VAP) mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus were increased along with the concentration of renin and Ang II in the plasma; these changes were accompanied by decreased glutathione peroxidase activity and increased lipid peroxidation levels and plasma corticosterone concentrations. Both candesartan and captopril suppressed not only the increases in SBP but also the increases in VAP expression in the hypothalamus and RAS components in the central nervous system and the circulatory system.

Hypokalemia plays a role in several cardiovascular diseases, but little is known about the association with AF. Objective: D-dimer values are frequently increased in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) compared with subjects in sinus rhythm. Hypokalemia plays a role in several cardiovascular diseases, but little is known about the association with AF. The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between D-dimer and serum potassium in acute-onset AF (AAF). Methods: To investigate the potential correlation between the values of serum potassium and D-dimer in patients with AAF, we retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory data of all emergency department visits for AAF in 2013. Results: Among 271 consecutive AAF patients with D-dimer assessments, those with hypokalemia (n = 98) had significantly higher D-dimer values than normokalemic patients (139 versus 114 ng/mL, p = 0.004). The rate of patients with D-dimer values exceeding the diagnostic cut-off was higher in the group of patients with hypokalemia than in those with normal serum potassium (26.5% versus 16.2%; p = 0.029). An inverse and highly significant correlation was found between serum potassium and D-dimer (r = -0.21; p < 0.001), even after adjustments for age and sex (beta coefficient -94.8; p = 0.001). The relative risk for a positive D-dimer value attributed to hypokalemia was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.02 to 2.63; p = 0.040). The correlation remained statistically significant in patients free from antihypertensive drugs (r = -0.25; p = 0.018), but not in those taking angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or diuretics. Conclusions: The inverse correlation between values of potassium and D-dimer in patients with AAF provides important and complementary information about the thromboembolic risk of these patients.Fundamento: Valores de D-d\u00edmero s\u00e3o frequentemente aumentada em pacientes com fibrila\u00e7\u00e3o atrial (FA) em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com indiv\u00edduos em ritmo sinusal.

All 6972 people from the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) with diabetes but without macroalbuminuria were studied. CKD progression was defined as decline in GFR of more than 5% per year, progression to end-stage renal disease, microalbuminuria, or macroalbuminuria at 5.5 years. Lifestyle/social factors included tobacco and alcohol use, physical activity, stress, financial worries, the size of the social network and education. Adjustments were made for known risks such as age, diabetes duration, GFR, albuminuria, gender, body mass index, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers use. Competing risk of death was considered. At study end, 31% developed CKD and 15% had died. The social network score (SNS) was a significant independent risk factor of CKD and death, reducing the risk by 11 and 22% when comparing the third to the first tertile of the SNS (odds ratios of CKD 0.89 and death 0.78). Education showed a significant association with CKD but stress and financial worries did not. Those with moderate alcohol consumption had a significantly decreased CKD risk compared with nonusers. Regular physical activity significantly decreased the risk of CKD. Thus, lifestyle is a determinant of kidney health in people at high cardiovascular risk with diabetes.",

Cardiovascular comorbidities, with the exception of heart failure, were more common in men. Women were more often treated with diuretics, and men with ACEI, as were hypertensive patients with diabetes. Comorbidities could not entirely explain gender differences in antihypertensive treatment in a regression model. Women had higher systolic and lower diastolic blood pressure; this was also true in subgroups with cardiovascular comorbidity. Men more often than women were prescribed ACEIs/ARBs and interrupted treatment. Women and men are treated with different antihypertensive drugs, and this is not fully explained by differences in comorbidities. Women have higher systolic blood pressures, irrespective of comorbidity. Men have interrupted treatment more often with ACEIs/ARBs. These gender differences could affect outcome and warrant further investigation.", 
    "774": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common reasons for physician visits and hospitalizations in North America. Rates of CAP increase with age and CAP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly. Though there is much written about the epidemiology and risk factors of incident (first episode) pneumonia, much less is known about recurrent pneumonia. Rates of recurrent pneumonia within 3-5-years of an episode of CAP are 9-12% with a median time to recurrence of 123-317 days and mortality ranging from 4 to 10%. Age \u226565-years-old and impaired functional status are the only patient characteristics that are independently associated with increased risk of recurrence. In terms of modifiable risk factors, only the use of proton-pump inhibitors and systemic and inhaled corticosteroids have consistently been associated with increased risk of recurrent pneumonia, while angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may exert a protective effect. Many chronic medical conditions typically associated with increased incident pneumonia-such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neurological disease (resulting in dysphagia or silent aspiration), and heart failure-were not associated with increased risk of recurrent pneumonia. However, those who are immune-suppressed (e.g., immunoglobulin deficiencies) may be at increased risk of recurrent pneumonia. In summary, among those who survive an episode of pneumonia, recurrence is not uncommon, particularly in the elderly. Following recovery from an episode of pneumonia, patients should be evaluated for risk factors that would predispose to a second episode including seeking evidence of immunosuppression in younger patients and medication optimization, particularly in the elderly.",

However, it remains unclear what factors predispose patients to renal toxicity during treatment. Here, we assessed the predictors and outcomes of patients experiencing AKI during chemoradiation. We carried out a retrospective cohort study to assess the maximum changes in serum creatinine (Cr) in 173 patients with stage III-IV head and neck cancer treated with chemoradiation between 1999 and 2012. We defined AKI as Cr increases 26.5\u2009\u00b5mol/l or more over the pretreatment baseline. AKI was associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use (33.0 vs. 11.0%; P=0.0004), but no other medications or comorbidities. On multivariate analysis, ACEI use, weight loss 10% or more of body weight, and performance status 70 or more predicted for Cr increments 26.5\u2009\u00b5mol/l or more, whereas only ACEI use predicted for Cr increments of 44.2\u2009\u00b5mol/l or greater. Furthermore, on multivariate analysis, AKI predicted for more interventions during radiotherapy including intravenous fluid use (P=0.0005) and hospitalizations (P=0.007), as well as long-term renal dysfunction (P<0.0001). Renal toxicity was not associated with worse locoregional control, progression-free survival, or overall survival. Renal toxicity during chemoradiation was associated with ACEI use alone or coupled with weight loss 10% or more of body weight during therapy. Our results suggest that actively managing ACEI use and intravascular volume status during chemoradiation may avoid AKI, minimize subsequent interventions, and reduce the risk for long-term renal dysfunction.", 
    "786": "Experiments were performed to determine whether or not acute exposure to elevated pressure would disrupt endothelium-dependent dilatation by increasing local angiotensin II (ANG II) signaling. Vasomotor responses of mouse-isolated carotid arteries were analyzed in a pressure myograph at a control transmural pressure (PTM) of 80 mmHg. Acetylcholine-induced dilatation was reduced by endothelial denudation or by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, 100 \u03bcM). Transient exposure to elevated PTM (150 mmHg, 180 min) inhibited dilatation to acetylcholine but did not affect responses to the nitric oxide donor diethylamine NONOate. Elevated PTM also increased endothelial reactive oxygen species, and the pressure-induced endothelial dysfunction was prevented by the direct antioxidant and NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (100 \u03bcM). The increase in endothelial reactive oxygen species in response to elevated PTM was reduced by the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists losartan (3 \u03bcM) or valsartan (1 \u03bcM). Indeed, elevated PTM caused marked expression of angiotensinogen, the precursor of ANG II. Inhibition of ANG II signaling, by blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme (1 \u03bcM perindoprilat or 10 \u03bcM captopril) or blocking AT1Rs prevented the impaired response to acetylcholine in arteries exposed to 150 mmHg but did not affect dilatation to the muscarinic agonist in arteries maintained at 80 mmHg. After the inhibition of ANG II, elevated pressure no longer impaired endothelial dilatation. In arteries treated with perindoprilat to inhibit endogenous formation of the peptide, exogenous ANG II (0.3 \u03bcM, 180 min) inhibited dilatation to acetylcholine. Therefore, elevated pressure rapidly impairs endothelium-dependent dilatation by causing ANG expression and enabling ANG II-dependent activation of AT1Rs. These processes may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension-induced vascular dysfunction and organ injury.",

Five RCTs (18\u200a,724 patients; SBP/DBP difference -10.5/-7 \u200ammHg) showed beta-blockers significantly reduced stroke, heart failure and major cardiovascular events. In RCTs comparing calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with placebo smaller SBP/DBP differences were achieved, mostly because in the majority of these later RCTs the antihypertensive drug and placebo were added on a background treatment with other antihypertensive agents. Nonetheless, significant reductions of stroke, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular and all-cause death were obtained with calcium antagonists (10 RCTs, 30,\u200a359 patients); stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure and major cardiovascular events by ACE inhibitors (12 RCTs, 35,\u200a707 patients); and stroke, heart failure and major cardiovascular events by ARBs (13 RCTs, 65,\u200a256 patients).",

RAS in SHR is also an important target for the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril. We aimed to determine if ultrafine carbon black (UCB) could affect antihypertensive effect of captopril in SHR. The rats were randomly divided into six groups. Group 1 did not receive intratracheal instillation; group 2 received saline instillation plus captopril administration; groups 3, 4 and 5 received 0.15\u2009mg/kg, 0.45\u2009mg/kg and 1.35\u2009mg/kg UCB per instillation plus captopril administration, respectively; group 6 received 1.35\u2009mg/kg UCB instillation only. Rats in the above groups were intratracheally instilled with saline or UCB once every two days for three times and captopril was administered to group 2-5 after the final UCB treatment, once a day for one week. The BP was measured 24\u2009h after each intratracheal instillation. During captopril administration and 24\u2009h after last captopril administration, we measured BP every two days for four times. Our results showed that UCB at the dose of 1.35\u2009mg/kg induced pulmonary and systemic inflammation in SHR. Captopril reduced BP in rats exposed to 0, 0.15 and 0.45\u2009mg/kg UCB seven and eleven days after the first UCB instillation, and had no effect on BP in rats exposed to 1.35\u2009mg/kg UCB. Captopril also reduced angiotensin II (AngII) in rats exposed to saline. The reduction, however, was attenuated with increasing doses of UCB. We conclude that UCB attenuated the antihypertensive effect of captopril in SHR, and the effect was accompanied by a systemic increase in the concentration of AngII.",

These results may indicate independent mechanisms by which H(2)S influences MAP and heart and breathing rates. The effect of Na(2)S in decreasing MAP was less pronounced in the presence of captopril (2 micromol/l), which may indicate that the renin-angiotensin system is partially involved in the Na(2)S effect.

The pathophysiology of HFPEF is heterogeneous but with a final common pathway leading to congestion. HF remains a clinical diagnosis but the plasma concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide (eg BNP/N-terminal prohormone BNP (NT-proBNP)), a marker of congestion, is an essential component. Imaging, usually by echocardiography, is required to determine the cardiac phenotype (ie valve disease, left ventricular ejection fraction) underlying HF. A superficially normal echocardiogram does not exclude a diagnosis of HF. No treatment has been shown conclusively to alter the prognosis of HFPEF. However, treatments directed at congestion and hypertension, such as diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors, may improve symptoms and probably do improve outcomes.

The purity of the isolated \u03b2-CN was determined by HPLC, variants were verified by mass spectrometry, and molar extinction coefficients at \u03bb=280nm were determined. \u03b2-Casein from each of the variants was subjected to in vitro digestion using pepsin and pancreatic enzymes. Antioxidant and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory capacities of the hydrolysates were assessed at 3 stages of digestion and related to that of the undigested samples. Neither molar extinction coefficients nor overall digestibility varied significantly between these 4 variants; however, clear differences in digestion pattern were indicated by gel electrophoresis. In particular, after 60min of pepsin followed by 5min of pancreatic enzyme digestion, one \u22484kDa peptide with the N-terminal sequence (106)H-K-E-M-P-F-P-K- was absent from \u03b2-CN variant B. This is likely a result of the (122)Ser to (122)Arg substitution in variant B introducing a novel trypsin cleavage site, leading to the changed digestion pattern. All investigated \u03b2-CN variants exhibited a significant increase in antioxidant capacity upon digestion, as measured by the Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity assay. After 60min of pepsin + 120min of pancreatic enzyme digestion, the accumulated increase in antioxidant capacity was \u22481.7-fold for the 4 \u03b2-CN variants. The ACE inhibitory capacity was also significantly increased by digestion, with the B variant reaching the highest inhibitory capacity at the end of digestion (60min of pepsin + 120min of pancreatic enzymes), possibly because of the observed alternative digestion pattern. These results demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms affect the digestion pattern and bioactivity of milk proteins.

The data also indicate that CPT was effective in reversing these cardio-respiratory disorders, suggesting that ACEi could be a potential therapeutic target for PAH.", 
    "867": "The present study was performed to investigate the peripheral cardiovascular effects of opiorphin in anesthetized rats. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of opiorphin (50-500nmol/kg) caused marked dose-dependent increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The pressor and tachycardic responses induced by opiorphin (300nmol/kg, i.v.) were significantly decreased by pretreatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist valsartan, which suggested that endogenous angiotensin may be involved in the response to opiorphin. Pretreatment with \u03b1-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol respectively attenuated the pressor response induced by opiorphin. Propranolol, but not phentolamine, inhibited the tachycardic response. Moreover, reserpine blocked both responses to opiorphin. These findings indicated that the effects of opiorphin to increase blood pressure and heart rate might be due to the stimulation of sympathetic ganglia. Additionally, studies with bilaterally adrenalectomized rats showed that adrenal medulla may be involved in the cardiovascular regulation of opiorphin. In addition, pretreatment with nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone did not modify the cardiovascular responses to opiorphin, suggesting that the effects of opiorphin were not related to the opioid system. Furthermore, radioimmunoassay (RIA) showed that opiorphin significantly increased endogenous levels of angiotensin II and angiotensin III. In summary, all the results indicate that the cardiovascular effects induced by opiorphin are mediated through the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla, but not the opioid system.", 
    "868": "A new strategy of the convergence of high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) and bioactive assay technique was developed for rapidly screening and separating the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors from the aerial parts of Desmodium styracifolium. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the crude extract was first established to target the bioactive fractions based on HSCCC coupled with in vitro ACE inhibitory assay. Subsequently, the bioactive fractions were further separated by the recycling complexation HSCCC respectively, using 0.10 mol/L copper sulfate in the lower phase of two-phase solvent system composed of n-butanol/water (1:1, v/v). Five C-glycosylflavones, vicenin 2 (1), carlinoside (2), vicenin 1 (3), schaftoside (4) and vicenin 3 (5), were successfully obtained. Their chemical structures were identified using ESI-MS and NMR. All the isolates showed in vitro ACE inhibitory activity with the IC50 values between 33.62 and 58.37 \u03bcM. The results demonstrated that the established method was proposed as an excellent strategy to systematically screen and purify active compounds from traditional Chinese medicines.", 
    "869": "To improve the management of resistant hypertension, the French Society of Hypertension, an affiliate of the French Society of Cardiology, has published a set of eleven recommendations. The primary objective is to provide the most up-to-date information, based on the strongest scientific rationale and which is easily applicable to daily clinical practice for health professionals working within the French health system. Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) both on office measurements and confirmed by out-of-office measurements despite a therapeutic strategy comprising appropriate lifestyle and dietary measures and the concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents including a thiazide diuretic, a renin-angiotensin system blocker (ARB or ACEI) and a calcium channel blocker, for at least four weeks, at optimal doses. Treatment compliance must be closely monitored, as most factors that are likely to affect treatment resistance (excessive dietary salt intake, alcohol, depression and drug interactions, or vasopressors). If the diagnosis of resistant hypertension is confirmed, the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist to screen for potential target organ damage and secondary causes of hypertension. The recommended treatment regimen is a combination therapy comprising four treatment classes, including spironolactone (12.5 to 25mg/day). In the event of a contraindication or a non-response to spironolactone, or if adverse effects occur, a \u03b2-blocker, an \u03b1-blocker, or a centrally acting antihypertensive drug should be prescribed. Because renal denervation is still undergoing assessment for the treatment of hypertension, this technique should only be prescribed by a specialist hypertension clinic.",

Two mathematical models were developed to show the effect of each variable and their combinatorial interactions on ACE inhibitory activity. The optimum levels of the parameters in SFU were determined using uniform design, which revealed these as follows: total ultrasonic time 1.5 h, on-time of pulse 18 s and off-time of pulse 3 s. Under optimized conditions, the experimental values of SFU and SFCU were 65.88% and 67.78%, which agreed closely with the predicted values of 63.44% and 67.33%. The SFU and SFCU pretreatments both resulted in higher ACE inhibitory activity compared with untreated garlic (p<0.05). However, there were no significant differences in the ACE inhibitory activities and IC\u2085\u2080 values obtained from SFCU and SFU pretreatments under optimum conditions (p>0.05).", 
    "871": "Prehypertension should be treated with lifestyle measures and not with antihypertensive drug therapy in older adults. Lifestyle measures should be encouraged both to retard development of hypertension and as adjunctive therapy in those with hypertension. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials of 40,325 older persons showed that antihypertensive drug therapy significantly reduced all-cause mortality 13% (7-19%), cardiovascular death 18% (7-27%), cardiovascular events 21% (13-27%), stroke 30% (23-37%), and fatal stroke by 33% (9-50%) (Ostrowski et al., 2014 [32]). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2011 expert consensus document on hypertension in the elderly recommended that the systolic blood pressure be lowered to <140 mm Hg in older persons younger than 80 years and to 140-145 mm Hg if tolerated in adults aged 80 years and older. A meta-analysis of 147 randomized trials including 464,000 persons with hypertension showed that except for the extra protective effect of beta blockers given after myocardial infarction and a minor additional effect of calcium channel blockers in preventing stroke, the use of beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics, and calcium channel blockers cause a similar reduction in coronary events and stroke for a given decrease in blood pressure. The choice of specific antihypertensive drugs such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers depends on efficacy, tolerability, presence of specific comorbidities and cost.",

ALLHAT compared cardiovascular disease outcomes in participants initially treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), or a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone). We report stroke outcomes in 1517 participants in-trial and 1596 additional participants during post-trial passive surveillance, for a total follow-up of 8-13 years. Stroke rates were higher with lisinopril (6-year rate/100 = 6.4) than with chlorthalidone (5.8) or amlodipine (5.5) in-trial but not including post-trial (10-year rates/100 = 13.2 [chlorthalidone], 13.1[amlodipine], and 13.7 [lisinopril]). In-trial differences were driven by race (race-by-lisinopril/chlorthalidone interaction P = .005, race-by-amlodipine/lisinopril interaction P = .012) and gender (gender-by-lisinopril/amlodipine interaction P = .041), separately. No treatment differences overall, or by race or gender, were detected over the 10-year period. No differences appeared among treatment groups in adjusted risk of all-cause mortality including post-trial for participants with nonfatal in-trial strokes. Among Blacks and women, lisinopril was less effective in preventing stroke in-trial than either chlorthalidone or amlodipine, even after adjusting for differences in systolic blood pressure. These differences abated by the end of the post-trial period.", 
    "873": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is now recognized as an important modulator of body metabolic processes. The discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has renewed interest in the potential therapeutic role of RAS modulation. Recent studies have pointed out the importance of the local balance between ACE/Ang-II/AT1 and ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas arms to avoid liver metabolic diseases. Furthermore, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is an increasing health problem that includes a spectrum of hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Some new studies revealed that RAS imbalance appears to promote hepatic fibrogenesis; while the activation of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas counter-regulatory axis is able to prevent liver injuries. In this context, the aim of the present review is to discuss the importance of RAS in the development and prevention of liver disease. AT1 receptor activation by Ang II induces hepatic stellate cell contraction and proliferation, causes oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, cell growth and inflammation. In addition, both AT1 blocker administration and ACE inhibitors lead to a reduction in inflammation and improvement of hepatic fibrosis. Conversely, Ang-(1-7) infusion reduces fibrosis and proliferation mainly by suppression of hepatic stellate cell activation; Mas receptor antagonism aggravates liver fibrosis and severe liver steatosis. In conclusion, the use of ACE/Ang II/AT1 axis inhibitors associated with ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas axis activation is a promising new strategy serving as a novel therapeutic regimen to prevent and treat chronic liver diseases as well as acute liver injury.",

GLP-1 agent users were matched 1:2 to control subjects with the use of propensity matching based on age, race, sex, coronary disease, HF, diabetes duration, and number of antidiabetic medications. The association of GLP-1 agents with time to HF hospitalization was tested with multivariable Cox regression. All-cause hospitalization and mortality were secondary end points. We identified 1,426 users of GLP-1 agents and 2,798 control subjects. Both were similar except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker use, number of antidiabetic medications, and age. There were 199 hospitalizations, of which 128 were for HF, and 114 deaths. GLP-1 agents were associated with reduced risk of HF hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.77; P = .002), all-cause hospitalization (aHR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38-0.74; P = .001), and death (aHR 0.31, 95% CI 0.18-0.53; P = .001).",

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) continues to be a problem for clinicians, with no clear consensus on how to investigate and assess the clinical significance of stenotic lesions and manage the findings. RAS caused by fibromuscular dysplasia is probably commoner than previously appreciated, should be actively looked for in younger hypertensive patients and can be managed successfully with angioplasty. Atheromatous RAS is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular events and increased cardiovascular mortality, and is likely to be seen with increasing frequency. Many patients with RAS may be managed effectively with medical therapy for several years without endovascular stenting, as demonstrated by randomized, prospective trials including the cardiovascular outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trial, the Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) trial. These trials share the limitation of excluding subsets of patients with high-risk clinical presentations, including episodic pulmonary edema and rapidly progressing renal failure and hypertension. Blood pressure control and medication adjustment may become more difficult with declining renal function and may prevent the use of angiotensin receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The objective of this review is to evaluate the current management of RAS for cardiologists in the context of recent randomized clinical trials. There is now interest in looking more closely at patient selection for intervention, with focus on intervening only in patients with the highest-risk presentations such as flash pulmonary edema, rapidly declining renal function and severe resistant hypertension.",

    "882": "Previous report showed that angiotensin II accelerates osteoporosis, and recent clinical studies suggest that several antihypertensive drugs, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, reduced bone fractures. However, the underling mechanism by which angiotensin II induces bone dysfunction is largely unknown. Here in this study, we show that angiotensin II induces mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. We find that the protein and RNA levels of mitochondrial catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) are decreased in osteoblasts in the presence of angiotensin II. Further, we show that angiotensin II inhibits the protein level of SIRT1, but not SIRT3, which results in the hyperacetylation of the forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) and inhibition of the expression of catalase and MnSOD. Finally, we show that SRT3025 (Sirt1 activator) and Mn (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP, a MnSOD mimetics) can markedly reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress and mtDNA damage. In summary, we identify a novel SIRT1\u2013FoxO3a\u2013MnSOD axis in angiotensin II-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress and mtDNA damage in osteoblasts.",

We confirmed that the gene expression levels of 2005 among these proteins also increased by performing an RNA sequencing transcriptomics. Expression of proteins involved in carboxylic acid metabolism, small-molecule metabolic processes, hormone regulation, and lipid metabolism was significantly enhanced in wild-type ovules. Quantitative real-time PCR verified the increased expression of 26 genes involved in these processes. Cotton 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase (GhPAS2) catalyzing the third reaction of very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) biosynthesis, accumulated at anthesis in wild-type ovules. Heterogeneous expression of GhPAS2 restored viability to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid psh1-deletion strain deficient in PAS2 activity. Application of VLCFA biosynthesis inhibitor acetochlor (2-chloro-N-[ethoxymethyl]-N-[2-ethyl-6-methyl-phenyl]-acetamide; ACE) and gibberellic acid to the unfertilized cotton ovules significantly suppressed fiber cell protrusion. In this study, the profiling of gene expression at both transcriptome and proteome levels provides new insights into cotton fiber cell initiation.",

In consistence with these findings, we characterized GhPAS2 gene coding for the enzyme that catalyzes VLCFA production. VLCFA biosynthesis inhibitor, acetochlor, was shown to significantly suppress fiber initiation.

The aim of the present study was to develop a versatile casting solution suitable for the extemporaneous production of ODFs to which active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can be added. Different combinations of film forming agents and other excipients and different casting heights were tested for their suitability for production of ODFs. The best suitable casting solution contained hypromellose, carbomer, glycerol, disodium EDTA and trometamol. This casting solution was used to prepare ODFs containing water-soluble APIs (enalapril maleate and prednisolone disodium phosphate) and a poorly water-soluble API (diazepam) for which ethanol 96% was used as co-solvent.The water-soluble APIs as well as ethanol influenced the viscosity of the casting solution, mechanical properties and disintegration time of the ODFs. All ODFs containing API met the requirements on uniformity of mass and uniformity of content set by the European Pharmacopoeia (2014) (Ph. Eur.) 8th edition. In conclusion, ODFs of good pharmaceutical quality can be prepared on small scale. Hereby opening the perspective of using ODFs for individualized pharmacotherapy.", 
    "886": "Alpha2-adrenergic, gabaergic or opioidergic activation in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) increases sodium intake. In the present study, we investigated the effects of single or combined blockade of opioidergic and gabaergic receptors in the LPBN on the increase of 0.3M NaCl intake induced by \u03b12-adrenoceptor activation in the LPBN. Male Holtzman rats (n=5-9/group) with cannulas implanted bilaterally in the LPBN were treated with the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg b wt.) combined with low dose of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg b wt.) subcutaneously. Bilateral injections of moxonidine (alpha2-adrenergic/imidazoline receptor agonist, 0.5 nmol) into the LPBN increased furosemide+captopril-induced 0.3M NaCl intake (25.8\u00b11.4, vs. vehicle: 3.8\u00b11.1 ml/60 min). The opioidergic receptor antagonist naloxone (100 nmol) or the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (5 nmol) injected into the LPBN partially reduced the increase of 0.3M NaCl intake produced by LPBN moxonidine (11.8\u00b14.0 and 22.8\u00b14.5, respectively, vs. vehicle+moxonidine: 31.6\u00b14.0 ml/60 min, respectively). Similar to the treatment with each antagonist alone, the combined injections of naloxone (100 nmol) and bicuculline (5 nmol) into the LPBN also partially reduced moxonidine effects on 0.3M NaCl intake (15.5\u00b16.5 ml/60 min). The GABAB receptor antagonist saclofen (5 nmol) injected into the LPBN did not change the effects of moxonidine on 0.3M NaCl intake (24.3\u00b17.8 ml/120 min). These results suggest that the increase of 0.3M NaCl intake by \u03b12-adrenergic receptor activation in the LPBN is partially dependent on GABAA and opioid receptor activation in this area.", 
    "887": "While there have been significant recent advances in the medical management of chronic HF (including the use of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and aldosterone blockers), the ability to characterize, monitor, and predict a patient's response to HF therapy is poor. Risk stratification is important in patients with chronic heart failure and enables informed decisions about treatment and end-of-life care. Clinical parameters, such as advanced age, higher NYHA functional class, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, lower body mass index, renal dysfunction, and anemia have all been associated with poor outcomes in HF. More recently, heart failure biomarkers have considerably changed the way we take care of our HF patients. BNP and NT-proBNP are endorsed by current guidelines and are now the gold standard biomarkers to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate the prognosis of heart failure. Studies on natriuretic peptide-guided HF therapy look promising. Novel biomarkers, such soluble ST2, growth differentiation factor-15, highly sensitive troponins and Galectin-3, show potential in assessing prognosis beyond the established natriuretic peptides, but their role in the clinical care of the patient is still partially defined and more studies are needed.", 
    "888": "One of the best-studied diets for cardiovascular health is the Mediterranean diet. This consists of fish, monounsaturated fats from olive oil, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes/nuts, and moderate alcohol consumption. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce the burden, or even prevent the development, of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, depression, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, asthma, erectile dysfunction, and cognitive decline. This diet is also known to improve surrogates of cardiovascular disease, such as waist-to-hip ratio, lipids, and markers of inflammation, as well as primary cardiovascular disease outcomes such as death and events in both observational and randomized controlled trial data. These enhancements easily rival those seen with more established tools used to fight cardiovascular disease such as aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and exercise. However, it is unclear if the Mediterranean diet offers cardiovascular disease benefit from its individual constituents or in aggregate. Furthermore, the potential benefit of the Mediterranean diet or its components is not yet validated by concrete cardiovascular disease endpoints in randomized trials or observational studies. This review will focus on the effects of the whole and parts of the Mediterranean diet with regard to both population-based and experimental data highlighting cardiovascular disease morbidity or mortality and cardiovascular disease surrogates when hard outcomes are not available. Our synthesis will highlight the potential for the Mediterranean diet to act as a key player in cardiovascular disease prevention, and attempt to identify certain aspects of the diet that are particularly beneficial for cardioprotection.",

For clinicians dealing with HF patients, risk prediction in both acute, chronic, and new onset HF remains a challenge. Biomarkers might help in risk stratification and may guide the proper use of limited resources and therapy. Galectin-3 is an emerging biomarker which has been linked to tissue fibrosis, a hallmark in cardiac remodeling and HF. Galectin-3 can reliably be measured in the circulation, and several recent studies have shown the prognostic value of galectin-3 in acute and chronic HF, and its potential utility in the general population.

    "895": "IBD is an established risk factor for venous thromboembolism. In the past few years, studies have suggested that patients with IBD might also be at an increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. The increased risk is thought to be similar to the level of risk seen in patients with other chronic systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The risk of developing these conditions is particularly increased in young adults with IBD, and more so in women than in men. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors are not over-represented in patients with IBD, so the increased risk could be attributable to inflammation-mediated atherosclerosis. Patients with IBD often have premature atherosclerosis and have biochemical and genetic markers similar to those seen in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The role of chronic inflammation in IBD-associated cardiovascular disease merits further evaluation. Particular attention should be given to the increased risk observed during periods of increased disease activity and potential modification of the risk by immunosuppressive and biologic therapies for IBD that can modify the disease activity. In addition, preclinical studies suggest that cardiovascular medications such as statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might also favourably modify IBD disease activity, which warrants further evaluation.", 
    "896": "Cardiac dysfunction of both systolic and diastolic origins leads to increased left atrial pressure, lung capillary injury and increased resistance to gas transfer. Acutely, pressure-induced trauma disrupts the endothelial and alveolar anatomical configuration and definitively causes an impairment of cellular pathways involved in fluid-flux regulation and gas exchange efficiency, a process well identified as stress failure of the alveolar-capillary membrane. In chronic heart failure (HF), additional stimuli other than pressure may trigger the true remodeling process of capillaries and small arteries characterized by endothelial dysfunction, proliferation of myofibroblasts, fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition. In parallel there is a loss of alveolar gas diffusion properties due to the increased path from air to blood (thickening of extracellular matrix) and loss of fine molecular mechanism involved in fluid reabsorption and clearance. Deleterious changes in gas transfer not only reflect the underlying lung tissue damage but also portend independent prognostic information and may play a role in the pathogenesis of exercise limitation and ventilatory abnormalities observed in these patients. Few currently approved treatments for chronic HF have the potential to positively affect structural remodeling of the lung capillary network; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are one of the few currently established options. Recently, more attention has been paid to novel therapies specifically targeting the nitric oxide pathway as a suitable target to improve endothelial function and permeability as well as alveolar gas exchange properties.", 
    "897": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic, neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive decline and psychiatric disturbances. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) is an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which thereby reduces production of ATP. It induces neurotoxicity by causing striatal degeneration, energy deficit and oxidative stress. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is an important protease in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) responsible for the conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. Angiotensin-II stimulates mitochondrial oxidant release leading to depression of energy metabolism. ACE inhibitors have shown promise in disorders like stress, anxiety, and depression in addition to showing beneficial effects in cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's. Angiotensin-II inhibition enhances energy production by lowering mitochondrial oxidant production, and hence protects mitochondrial structure. Trandolapril is a centrally active ACE inhibitor. 3-NP administered systematically (20mg/kg, i.p) for 4 days consecutively induced HD like symptoms - loss of body weight, neurobehavioral alterations like memory dysfunction (elevated plus maze, Morris water maze performance), Hind-limb impairment (Narrow beam test), motor incoordination (locomotor activity). Biochemical studies on brain tissue showed increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite levels and acetylcholinesterase activity along with decreased levels of reduced glutathione, catalase activity. Mitochondrial enzyme complex activities (I, II, IV and MTT assay) were found to be significantly lowered in brain mitochondria. Administration of Trandolapril (4 and 6 mg/kg, p.o) daily for 12 days showed significant improvement in body weight, neurobehavioral parameters, oxidative stress and mitochondrial enzyme activities in rat brain. These findings were further confirmed by histopathological studies which showed improvement in 3-NP induced brain lesions. This study indicates that Trandolapril could be an effective treatment option for the management of HD.", 
    "898": "The aim of this study is to obtain swelling controlled release matrix tablets of captopril using the Quality by Design methodology (ICH Q8) and to know the transport mechanisms involved in captopril release. To obtain the area of knowledge, the design of experiments studying the effect of two components (HPMC K15M and ethylcellulose) at different levels has been applied, with the captopril dissolution profile as the product's most important critical quality attribute (CQA). Different dissolution profiles have been obtained with the design of experiments performed, which is a key factor in the development of controlled release matrix tablets. Kinetic analysis according to the equations of Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas demonstrates that the release mechanism is a mechanism of erosion when the whole percentage of the polymer is ethylcellulose, and a diffusion mechanism when the whole percentage of the polymer is HPMC K15M. The physico-chemical characteristics of the gel layer determine the release rate of captopril. The thickness of the gel layer, the porosity which is formed in the matrix upon contact with water, pore size, the swelling rate, the erosion rate of the matrix, and the physico-chemical characteristics of captopril, are factors related to the kinetic equations described and that allow us to predict the release mechanism of captopril. A new relationship of the kinetic equations governing the in vitro behavior with the physical characteristics of the gel layer of the different formulations has been established. This study shows that the size of water-filled pores and the degree of crosslinking between the chains of HPMC K15M of the matrix are related to the exponent n of the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation and the type of transport of the captopril from within the matrix to the dissolution medium, that is, if the transport is only through water-filled pores, or if a combination of diffusion occurs through water-filled pores with a transport through continuous polymeric networks.", 
    "899": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), participated by kidney, liver, vascular endothelium, and adrenal cortex, and counter-regulated by cardiac endocrine function, is a complex endocrine system regulating systemic functions, such as body salt and water homeostasis and vasomotion, in order to allow the accomplishment of physiological tasks, such as orthostasis, physical and emotional stimuli, and to react towards the hemorrhagic insult, in tight conjunction with other neurohormonal axes, namely the sympathetic nervous system, the endothelin and vasopressin systems. The systemic as well as the tissue RAAS are also dedicated to promote tissue remodeling, particularly relevant after damage, when chronic activation may configure as a maladaptive response, leading to fibrosis, hypertrophy and apoptosis, and organ dysfunction. RAAS activation is a fingerprint of systemic arterial hypertension, kidney dysfunction, vascular atherosclerotic disease, and is definitely an hallmark of heart failure, which rapidly shifts from organ disease to a disorder of neurohormonal regulatory systems. Chronic RAAS activation is an indirect or direct target of most effective pharmacological treatments in heart failure, such as beta-blockers, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers. Biomarkers of RAAS activation are available, with different feasibility and accuracy, such as plasma renin activity, renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone, which all accompany the increasing clinical severity of heart failure disease, and are well recognized prognostic factors, even in patients with optimal therapy. Polymorphisms influencing the expression and activity of RAAS pathways have been recognized as clinically relevant biomarkers, likely influencing either the individual clinical phenotype, or the response to drugs. This solid, growing evidence strongly suggests the rationale for the use of biomarkers of the RAAS activation, as a guide to tailor individual therapy in the current practice, and their implementation as a rule-in marker for future trials on novel drugs in the heart failure setting.", 
    "900": "Patients with hypertension have a high risk of ischemic stroke and subsequent stroke-associated pneumonia. Stroke-associated pneumonia is most likely to develop in patients with dysphagia. The present study was designed to compare the ameliorative effects of different treatments in rat model of dysphagia. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) to induce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion causing disorders of the swallowing reflex. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (perindopril, imidapril and enalapril), an angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker (losartan), a vasodilator (hydralazine) and an indirect dopamine agonist (amantadine) were dissolved in drinking water and administered to the rats for six weeks. The blood pressure, the swallowing reflex under anesthesia, the substance P content in the striatum and the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the substantial nigra were measured. Compared to the vehicle control, the decrease in the swallowing reflex induced by BCAO was attenuated significantly by enalapril, imidapril and perindopril, but only slightly by losartan. Hydralazine had no effect on the swallowing reflex. Amantadine significantly attenuated the decreased swallowing reflex but increased the blood pressure. Cerebral hypoperfusion for six weeks decreased the TH expression and substance P level. Perindopril improved both the TH expressions and substance P level, but imidapril, enalapril and amantadine only improved the substance P level. The present findings indicate that perindopril could be useful for preventing dysphagia in the chronic stage of stroke by attenuating the decrease in TH expression and the decrease in the substance P level.",

Perindopril arginine (10mg/kg) raised the convulsive threshold for LEV administered at doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. This interaction could be pharmacodynamic in nature because the brain concentration of LEV remained unchanged by perindopril. The adverse effects of the combined treatment with LEV and cardiovascular drugs were not observed in the passive avoidance task or the chimney test.", 
    "904": "Although experimental data can be hardly extrapolated to clinical practice, it is suggested that perindopril arginine may positively influence the anticonvulsant action of LEV in epileptic patients. The use of losartan potassium, candesartan cilexetil, captopril, hydrochlorothiazide or ethacrynic acid in patients treated with LEV seems neutral regarding its anticonvulsant activity.",

An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-(14)C]Lys-Pro ((14)C-MKP) showed that orally administered (14)C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.",

SSF extracts showed high soluble phenolic compound content (31-36 mg/g) and antioxidant activity (508-541 \u03bcg trolox equivalents/g), whilst LSF extracts exhibited potential antihypertensive activity due to their large \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content (6.8-10.6 mg/g) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) activity (>90%).

Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of the addition of dietary flavonoids (DF) to antihypertensive treatment (AHT), based on telmisartan (Tms) or captopril (Cpr), on blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio, leptin, lipid profile and inflammation in hypertensive young patients. An open-label, randomized, controlled trial was performed among 79 patients aged 20-55 years with grade I or grade II systemic arterial hypertension. The subjects were assigned to one of four groups for AHT plus DF during 6 months: Cpr (n = 14), Cpr + DF (n = 19), Tms (n = 25) and Tms + DF (n = 21). DF consisted of dark chocolate, dehydrated red apple and green tea in an infusion to obtain a daily dose of 425.8 \u00b1 13.9 mg epicatechin equivalents. The BP and anthropometric parameters were measured every 2 weeks. Lipid profile, leptin and hsCRP were determined by standard methods. The combination AHT-DF produced an additional and significant reduction in (i) SBP/DBP of -5/-4 mmHg, being -7/-5 for Cpr + DF and -4/-3 for Tms + DF; (ii) triglyceride levels (-30.6%) versus AHT alone (-9.6%); and (iii) leptin: Cpr + DF versus Tms + DF (p < 0.005). Finally, C-reactive protein plasma levels were reduced significantly in all groups independently of the applied treatment. We conclude that the addition of flavonoids to pharmacological antihypertensive therapy shows additional benefits on BP, lipid profile, leptin, obesity and inflammation.",

The aim of this work is to determine the influence of the addition of fresh pumpkin pulp directly into wheat flour on physical, sensorial and biological properties of bread. The bioaccessibility of active compounds was also studied. An increase in the addition of pumpkin pulp from 5 to 20% (converted to dry matter) caused a decrease of bread volume and increase of crumb hardness and cohesiveness. The sensory characteristics of the bread showed that a partial replacement of wheat flour with up to 10% of pumpkin pulp gave satisfactory results. The taste, aroma and overall acceptability of control bread and bread containing 5 or 10% of pulp had the highest degree of liking. The addition of higher levels of pumpkin pulp caused an unpleasant aroma and taste. Pumpkin pulp is a good material to complement the bread with potentially bioaccessible phenolics (including flavonoids) and, especially, with peptides. The highest antioxidant activity was observed, in most cases, of the samples with added 10 and 15% of pumpkin pulp. The addition of the pulp significantly enriched the bread with potentially bioaccessible angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The highest activity was determined in the bread with 15 and 20% pumpkin pulp. ACE inhibitors from the tested bread were highly bioaccessible in vitro. Pumpkin pulp seems to be a valuable source of active compounds to complement the wheat bread. Adding the pulp directly to the wheat flour gives satisfactory baking results and reduces the cost of production. Additionally, pumpkin pulp is sometimes treated as waste material after the acquisition of seeds, thus using it as bread supplement also has environmental and economic benefits.

The surface free energy results obtained show that hydroxypropylmethylcellulose K15M hinders the spreading of water on the surface of the tablet, such that the concentration of HPMC K15M increases the reaction rate of the hydrophobic interactions between the chains of HPMC K15M which increases with respect to the rate of penetration of water into the tablet. In this study, we developed a new method to characterize the swelling of the tablets and established a relationship between the new method based on microswelling and the swelling ratio parameter.

Here, we designed and developed an antagonistic peptide, PRO20, to block prorenin binding to the PRR. Fluorescently labeled PRO20 bound to both mouse and human brain tissues with dissociation constants of 4.4 and 1.8 nmol/L, respectively. This binding was blocked by coincubation with prorenin and was diminished in brains of neuron-specific PRR-knockout mice, indicating specificity of PRO20 for PRR. In cultured human neuroblastoma cells, PRO20 blocked prorenin-induced calcium influx in a concentration- and AT(1) receptor-dependent manner. Intracerebroventricular infusion of PRO20 dose-dependently inhibited prorenin-induced hypertension in C57Bl6/J mice. Furthermore, acute intracerebroventricular infusion of PRO20 reduced blood pressure in both DOCA-salt and genetically hypertensive mice. Chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of PRO20 attenuated the development of hypertension and the increase in brain hypothalamic angiotensin II levels induced by DOCA-salt. In addition, chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of PRO20 improved autonomic function and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity in mice treated with DOCA-salt. In summary, PRO20 binds to both mouse and human PRRs and decreases angiotensin II formation and hypertension induced by either prorenin or DOCA-salt. Our findings highlight the value of the novel PRR antagonist, PRO20, as a lead compound for a novel class of antihypertensive agents and as a research tool to establish the validity of brain PRR antagonism as a strategy for treating hypertension.",

    "974": "The deterioration of renal function, which is linked to chronic heart failure by a chronological and causal relationship (ie, the so-called cardiorenal syndrome [CRS] type 2), has recently become a matter of growing debate. This debate has concerned the efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of the therapies that have been implemented thus far for this syndrome (for example, the intravenous [IV] loop diuretics, such as repeated IV boluses or slow IV infusions, as well as mechanical fluid removal, particularly by means of isolated ultrafiltration [IUF]). Further controversies have also emerged concerning the optimal dosage and timing of some evidence-based drugs, such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. The present review summarizes the currently used diagnostic tools for detecting renal damage in CRS type 2. Subsequently, the meaning of worsening renal function is outlined, as well as the sometimes inconsistent therapeutic schemes that have been implemented in order to prevent or counteract worsening renal function. The need to elaborate upon more detailed and comprehensive scientific recommendations for targeted prevention and/or therapy of CRS type 2 is also underlined. The measures usually adopted (such as the more accurate modulation of loop diuretic dose, combined with the exploitation of other diuretics that are able to achieve a sequential blockade of the nephron, as well as the use of IV administration for loop diuretics) are briefly presented. The concept of diuretic resistance is illustrated, along with the paramount operational principles of IUF in diuretic-resistant patients. Some controversies regarding the comparison of IUF with stepped diuretic therapy in patients with CRS type 2 are also addressed.",

Baseline adiponectin, leptin, and LAR levels did not differ significantly between the three groups. After 6 months of treatment, LAR was significantly higher in group 3 than group 1 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007) or group 2 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.023). Differences between effects of high (32\u00a0mg) and conventional doses (16\u00a0mg) of Candesartan on LAR were not observed (P\u00a0=\u00a0.678). Marginal across-group differences were detected for posttreatment circulating adiponectin level (P\u00a0=\u00a0.064). Univariate general linear model (GLM) analysis of posttreatment LAR detected significant by-group differences even after adjustment for age, gender, baseline values of LAR, and blood pressure. In this model, group was the only significant predictor of LAR after controlling for these variables. Treatment with high doses of the ARB, candesartan, is associated with significantly reduced LAR and marginally increased circulating adiponectin levels in hypertensive patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors.",

    "979": "The direct impact of de novo synthesis of homocysteine (Hcy) and its reactive metabolites, Hcy-S-S-Hcy and Hcy thiolactone (HCTL), on vascular function has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that Hcy synthesized within endothelial cells affects activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by direct homocysteinylation of its amino- and/or sulfhydryl moieties. This covalent modification enhances ACE reactivity toward angiotensin II (ANG II)-NADPH oxidase-superoxide-dependent endothelial dysfunction. Mesenteric and coronary arteries isolated from normal rats were incubated for 3 days with or without exogenous methionine (Met, 0.1-0.3 mM), a precursor to Hcy. Incubation of arteries in Met-free media resulted in time-dependent decreases in vascular Hcy formation. By contrast, vessels incubated with Met produced Hcy in a dose-dependent manner. There was a notably greater de novo synthesis of Hcy from endothelial than from smooth muscle cells. Enhanced levels of Hcy production significantly impaired shear stress-induced dilation and release of nitric oxide, events that are associated with elevated production of vascular superoxide. Each of these processes was attenuated by ANG II type I receptor blocker or ACE and NADPH oxidase inhibitors. In addition, in vitro exposure of purified ACE to Hcy-S-S-Hcy/HCTL resulted in formation of homocysteinylated ACE and an enhanced ACE activity. The enhanced ACE activity was confirmed in isolated coronary and mesenteric arteries that had been exposed directly to Hcy-S-S-Hcy/HCTL or after Met incubation. In conclusion, vasculature-derived Hcy initiates endothelial dysfunction that, in part, may be mediated by ANG II-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase in association with homocysteinylation of ACE.",

The interparticle interactions were characterized by monitoring the evolution of the surface plasmon resonance band using the spectrophotometric method. The original gold nanoparticles were efficiently modified by small amounts of Mn(+2) ions, which are adsorbed onto the surface of 15.4 nm citrate-capped gold nanoparticles, giving rise to manganese-gold nanoparticles (Mn-AuNPs) that, in mild acid medium, have proved to be highly sensitive and a rapid colorimetric detection method for thiols. Depending on the concentration of the Mn(+2) ions the aggregation of AuNPs can be rapidly induced. The kinetics of the assembly process has been studied. Good first-order kinetics has been observed, with the exception of captopril-mediated nanoparticle aggregation at low concentration of either cap or acid. The rate of Cys-mediated assembly of gold nanoparticles in aqueous 10 mM acetic acid is more than 20-times faster than pure AuNPs and concentrations of Cys as low as 34 nM can be detected in less than 40 min under conditions of stable Mn-AuNPs.

This 20 percent difference means that the rate of persistence was higher by 58.8/2%. Considering only the 360-day study period, the mean duration of persistence was 272 days in patients on the fixed, and 206 days in those taking the free combination. Analyzing persistence on treatment with these combinations showed that the actual rate of discontinuation was about twice higher during treatment with the free, compared with the use of the fixed combination (hazard ratio = 1.94, p<0.001).",

Inadequately controlled hypertension is a significant cardiovascular risk factor. The markedly higher persistence of patients on therapy with the fixed combination of ramipril and amlodipine can lead to a reduction in cardiovascular risk, which might prove - on the longer term - a positive outcome of public health significance.",

    "1020": "In this study, a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory tripeptide (IVR) was isolated and identified from unfertilized soft-shelled turtle egg white (SSTEW). The IC50 value of IVR was measured in vitro as low as 0.81 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcM, and its inhibition type was suggested as competitive according to the Lineweaver-Burk plot. This peptide can be generated from either thermolysin followed by trypsin digestion (two stages) or only trypsin digestion (one stage). Quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis indicated that two-stage digestion gave 3.14 \u00b1 0.17 mg of IVR from 1 g of SSTEW, better than that from one-stage digestion (1.31 \u00b1 0.12 mg). In vivo antihypertensive activity of the tripeptide IVR after single oral administration (0.1 and 1 mg/kg of body weight) led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure 2-4 h after administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In addition, the binding mechanism of IVR has been rationalized through docking simulations using the testicular ACE (tACE)-lisinopril complex at 2 \u00c5 resolution (PDB 108A ). The best docking pose was located at the tACE catalytic site resembling the mode of inhibition exerted by lisinopril, an effective hypertensive synthetic drug. The degree of inhibition of this peptide correlated with the H-bond interaction between the C-terminal of IVR and Lys511 and Tyr520 residues of tACE, a significant inhibitor registration for lisinopril. This study illustrated that IVR behaves as a transition-state analogue inhibitor and is useful in therapeutic intervention for blood pressure control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an efficient ACE-inhibitory tripeptide generated from the unfertilized egg of soft-shelled turtle.",

The local RAS influences the survival and tissue repairing ability of transplanted stem cells. We have previously reported that angiotensin II (Ang II) pretreatment can significantly increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis in MSCs through the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways via the Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R). However, the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has not been clarified. Furthermore, whether Ang II pretreatment activates hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) in MSCs has not been elucidated. Our data show that both ACE and HIF-1\u03b1 are involved in promoting VEGF expression in MSCs, and that both are upregulated by Ang II stimulation. The upregulation of ACE appeared after the rapid degradation of exogenous Ang II, and led to the formation of endogenous Ang II. On the other hand, the ACE inhibitor, captopril, attenuated Ang II-enhanced HIF-1\u03b1 upregulation, while HIF-1\u03b1 suppression markedly attenuated ACE expression. This interesting finding suggests an interaction between ACE and HIF-1\u03b1. We conclude that Ang II pretreatment, as a trigger, activated the AT1R/HIF-1\u03b1/ACE axis that then mediated Ang II-induced VEGF synthesis in MSCs.",

Myosin heavy chain polymerization levels were also achieved in the presence of microbial transglutaminase (MTG) added at various concentrations in the surimi. The breaking strength and breaking strain rate were markedly increased during suwari treatment up to 60 min in accordance with the increased levels of myosin heavy chain polymerization. MTG enhanced myosin heavy chain polymerization during suwari treatment for 15 and 30 min, resulting in the increase of breaking strength. The solubilization in 8 M urea and pepsin digestibility of these gels as well as angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of their pepsin digests were decreased with the increased levels of myosin heavy chain polymerization.

Although hemodynamic stress on arterial walls can be reduced with use of beta-adrenergic blockers or other medications including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor 1 (ATIIR1) antagonists such as losartan, the efficacy of these treatments has not been established in ATS and caution is warranted when using blood pressure-lowering medications in the presence of arterial stenosis (anatomic or functional due to severe tortuosity), especially renal artery stenosis. Aneurysms and focal stenoses are amenable to surgical intervention. Skeletal manifestations such as scoliosis require management by an orthopedist, and ocular manifestations require management when possible by an ophthalmologist with expertise in connective tissue disorders. Wound healing may be delayed following surgery; thus, stitches should be placed without traction and remain in place ~10 days. A supporting mesh can be used in the surgical repair of hernias to reduce recurrence risk. Surveillance: Regular cardiovascular follow up (with MRA or CT scan with 3D reconstruction from head to pelvis) starting at birth or at the time of diagnosis. Routine follow-up for: pulmonary manifestations, refractive errors and keratoconus; orthopedic complications, such as scoliosis, especially during periods of rapid growth; possible dental crowding secondary to palatal abnormalities. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; scuba diving; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system (including routine use of decongestants); tobacco use; sun tanning. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband with ATS in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from treatment and surveillance for complications. Pregnancy management: Data on the management of women with arterial tortuosity syndrome during pregnancy and delivery are limited. Preconception counseling should include possible pregnancy-associated risks to the mother (mainly aortic root dilatation and dissection) and recommendation to discontinue medications with possible teratogenic effects (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-I], angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonists [ATIIR1] such as losartan, and anticoagulant therapy) and to begin therapy with \u03b2-blockers.",

This is an update of a review first published in 2004.Objectives To review systematically the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological or nutritional treatments for improving exercise performance and quality of life in McArdle disease.Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE on 11 August 2014.Selection criteria We included RCTs (including cross-over studies) and quasi-RCTs. We included unblinded open trials and individual patient studies in the discussion. Interventions included any pharmacological agent or nutritional supplement. Primary outcome measures included any objective assessment of exercise endurance (for example aerobic capacity (VO2) max, walking speed, muscle force or power and fatigability). Secondary outcome measures included metabolic changes (such as reduced plasma creatine kinase and a reduction in the frequency of myoglobinuria), subjective measures (including quality of life scores and indices of disability) and serious adverse events.Data collection and analysis Three review authors checked the titles and abstracts identified by the search and reviewed the manuscripts. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of relevant studies, with comments from a third author. Two authors extracted data onto a specially designed form.Main results We identified 31 studies, and 13 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. We described trials that were not eligible for the review in the Discussion. The included studies involved a total of 85 participants, but the number in each individual trial was small; the largest treatment trial included 19 participants and the smallest study included only one participant. There was no benefit with: D-ribose,glucagon, verapamil, vitamin B6, branched chain amino acids, dantrolene sodium, and high-dose creatine. Minimal subjective benefit was found with low dose creatine and ramipril only for patients with a polymorphism known as the D/Dangiotens in converting enzyme(ACE) phenotype. A carbohydrate-rich diet resulted in better exercise performance compared with a protein-rich diet. Two studies of oral sucrose given at different times and in different amounts before exercise showed an improvement in exercise performance. Four studies reported adverse effects. Oral ribose caused diarrhoea and symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia including light-headedness and hunger. In one study, branched chain amino acids caused a deterioration of functional outcomes. Dantrolene was reported to cause a number of adverse effects including tiredness, somnolence, dizziness and muscle weakness. Low dose creatine (60 mg/kg/day) did not cause side-effects but high-dose creatine (150 mg/kg/day) worsened the symptoms of myalgia.Authors' conclusions Although there was low quality evidence of improvement in some parameters with creatine, oral sucrose, ramipril and a carbohydrate rich diet, none was sufficiently strong to indicate significant clinical benefit.", 
    "1074": "About half of all patients who experience an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in Australia have their conditions managed non-invasively - that is, they do not undergo coronary angiography and revascularisation in hospital. ACS patients whose conditions are managed non-invasively may not receive the same level of evidence-based care as those who receive coronary revascularisation. This article reviews the optimal pharmacological management of ACS managed non-invasively. There is strong evidence to support the prescription of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin with a P2Y12 inhibitor). DAPT should continue for 12 months after an ACS, then aspirin should be continued indefinitely. Anticoagulation with warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be needed if atrial fibrillation occurs; the combination with DAPT increases the risk of bleeding. Unless contraindicated, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed for all post-ACS patients irrespective of their cholesterol level. Non-statin lipid therapy has not been shown to improve outcomes. Use of \u03b2-adrenergic blockers is recommended in most guidelines, but the clinical trials to support this recommendation were performed more than 30 years ago, and routine long-term use may not be relevant to modern treatment, except when there is cardiac failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are also widely recommended, but the evidence for benefit is stronger when there is left ventricular dysfunction. Calcium-channel blockers, nitrates, antiarrhythmic drugs, digoxin and diuretics do not improve outcomes in post-ACS patients.",

In fact, these drugs are primarily used in the management of cardiovascular system-related diseases and renal insufficiency. Their mechanism of action involves the adjustment of balance between vasoconstrictive, hypertrophic and salt/water-retentive angiotensin II and vasodilatory and natriuretic bradykinin by the inhibition of angiotensin II biosynthesis and bradykinin degradation. Currently there are thirteen family members approved for use in humans. They differ in structure, chemistry and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties yet they display a similar pharmacologic and toxicologic profile. All of them are effective in the treatment of hypertension as well as in cardiac insufficiency or diabetic nephropathy. Although they are generally well-tolerated several serious side-effects including life-threatening angioedema, renal failure and persistent dry cough could occur during the administration of ACE-Is, which may require the cessation of therapy. Furthermore, to provide maximum safety and efficiency of ACE-Is-based therapy, the knowledge of the related drug interactions and chronokinetics seems to be an absolute requirement.

Surveillance: Annual monitoring for hypertension and renal disease; screening for glaucoma as soon as a child is compliant. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Chronic use of NSAIDs because of the detrimental effect on kidney function. Pregnancy management: The risk of developing preeclampsia may be increased in pregnant women with NPS; hence frequent urinalysis and blood pressure measurement is recommended during pregnancy.

This study included 41 patients with CAD and 20 subjects without CAD (non-CAD). Plasma TLR4-responsive miRNA samples were analysed using a microarray assay for 1700 human miRNA. The candidate miRNAs were verified with real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Patients with CAD were randomized to 12 months of combined treatment with either telmisartan and atorvastatin [angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)] or enalapril and atorvastatin [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)]. Plasma samples were obtained from peripheral blood at baseline and after 12 months. The microarray assay showed significant differences in seven TLR4-responsive miRNAs between the CAD and non-CAD groups (P<0.05). Real-time PCR verified that miR-31, miR-181a, miR-16 and miR-145 were significantly lower in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (P<0.01). Levels of TLR4 protein were higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (P<0.01) and were negatively correlated with levels of TLR4-responsive miRNAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that a panel of these four miRNAs was sensitive and specific enough to distinguish CAD from non-CAD [area under the curve (AUC)=0.93, 95% CI (confidence interval)=0.99-0.87]. Both ARB and ACEI groups showed increased TLR4-responsive miRNAs and diminished levels of TLR4 protein (P<0.05). Changes in miRNAs and TLR4 levels were greater in the ARB group than in the ACEI group (P<0.05). Circulating TLR4-responsive miRNAs including miR-31, miR-181a, miR-16 and miR-145 were significantly lower in patients with CAD compared with controls and these miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of CAD.",

    "1101": "An international double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was performed to determine the efficacy and safety of a new first-line strategy in mild to moderate hypertension based on a single-pill combination of perindopril/amlodipine versus a validated stepped-care strategy (initiation with valsartan monotherapy, up-titrating to valsartan/amlodipine after 2 months).", 
    "1102": "At inclusion, patients received perindopril/amlodipine 3.5/2.5\u200amg or valsartan 80\u200amg. At 1, 2, and 3 months, patients were up-titrated if they had uncontrolled hypertension (\u2265140/90\u200ammHg). The up-titration steps were: perindopril/amlodipine 7/5\u200amg, 14/10\u200amg, and 14/10\u200amg + indapamide sustained release 1.5\u200amg; or valsartan 160\u200amg, valsartan/amlodipine 160/5\u200amg, and 160/10\u200amg. The two groups were similar at baseline (55.5 years, 53% men, blood pressure 163.5/100.2\u200ammHg); 881 perindopril/amlodipine and 876\u200avalsartan/amlodipine patients were analyzed for efficacy.", 
    "1103": "After 1 month, the rate of controlled hypertension was 33% with perindopril/amlodipine versus 27% with valsartan/amlodipine (estimate of difference, +6.1%; P\u200a=\u200a0.005); this between-strategy difference remained significant at every visit (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). After 3 months, blood pressure was 137.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a12.4/83.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.7 and 139.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a13.3/84.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a9.0\u200ammHg, respectively, with greater reductions from baseline with perindopril/amlodipine (primary endpoint -2.0/-1.5\u200ammHg; both P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Similar results were observed at all other visits (all P\u200a\u2264\u200a0.001). The safety of the two strategies was equivalent.", 
    "1104": "The three-step strategy of initiation with single-pill perindopril/amlodipine produces greater reductions in blood pressure, and better and quicker rates of control of hypertension. This can be expected to be associated with benefits beyond blood pressure control, notably improved compliance and better cardioprotection.", 
    "1105": "Neuropeptidases specialize in the hydrolysis of the small bioactive peptides that play a variety of signaling roles in the nervous and endocrine systems. One neuropeptidase, neurolysin, helps control the levels of the dopaminergic circuit modulator neurotensin and is a member of a fold group that includes the antihypertensive target angiotensin converting enzyme. We report the discovery of a potent inhibitor that, unexpectedly, binds away from the enzyme catalytic site. The location of the bound inhibitor suggests it disrupts activity by preventing a hinge-like motion associated with substrate binding and catalysis. In support of this model, the inhibition kinetics are mixed, with both noncompetitive and competitive components, and fluorescence polarization shows directly that the inhibitor reverses a substrate-associated conformational change. This new type of inhibition may have widespread utility in targeting neuropeptidases.", 
    "1106": "Nitroxyl (HNO), the protonated one-electron reduction product of NO, remains an enigmatic reactive nitrogen species. Its chemical reactivity and biological activity are still not completely understood. HNO donors show biological effects different from NO donors. Although HNO reactivity with molecular oxygen is described in the literature, the product of this reaction has not yet been unambiguously identified. Here we report that the decomposition of HNO donors under aerobic conditions in aqueous solutions at physiological pH leads to the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) as a major intermediate. We have specifically detected and quantified ONOO(-) with the aid of boronate probes, e.g. coumarin-7-boronic acid or 4-boronobenzyl derivative of fluorescein methyl ester. In addition to the major phenolic products, peroxynitrite-specific minor products of oxidation of boronate probes were detected under these conditions. Using the competition kinetics method and a set of HNO scavengers, the value of the second order rate constant of the HNO reaction with oxygen (k = 1.8 \u00d7 10(4) m(-1) s(-1)) was determined. The rate constant (k = 2 \u00d7 10(4) m(-1) s(-1)) was also determined using kinetic simulations. The kinetic parameters of the reactions of HNO with selected thiols, including cysteine, dithiothreitol, N-acetylcysteine, captopril, bovine and human serum albumins, and hydrogen sulfide, are reported. Biological and cardiovascular implications of nitroxyl reactions are discussed.", 
    "1107": "The effects of multiple medications may impair or enhance wound healing. A review of the literature for drug side effects identified cell culture and case studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) impairing collagen deposition in cutaneous wounds; these medications have also been used to prevent or minimize keloid formation.", 
    "1108": "A 71-year-old male patient presented with a venous leg ulcer (VLU), having incurred a crushing injury and fracture requiring surgical repair 16 years earlier. The patient's history was significant for obesity, smoking 1 cigar daily, hypertension, and lower extremity venous insufficiency; medications included amlodipine and lisinopril. The wound initially responded well to advanced wound products and compression, but wound healing subsequently stalled. A collagen-containing alginate dressing was added to the treatment regimen and the wound closed within 2 weeks.", 
    "1109": "We postulate that lisinopril may have contributed to the observed delayed healing and targeted this potential impediment to wound healing with a readily available topical collagen-containing product resulting in a rapid wound closure after a significant delay in progress toward wound healing."
