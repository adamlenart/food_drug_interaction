Primary prevention involves avoidance of root technique, graft repalcement of aneurysmal aorta, or modifications of the root technique. Use of beta-receptor antagonist or angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors for secondary prevention is still empirical. Indications to resection of root aneurysm are based on maximum root area indexed to body height.

In a time-dependent analysis for drug use, comparing obese with normal-weight patients, the HRs for mortality differed significantly (P=0.047) between patients without (HR 1.86) and those with (HR 0.97) neurohormonal blockade.", 
    "42": "In patients after AMI or with CAD, high BMI was associated with increased mortality risk among patients not receiving neurohormonal blockade, but with decreased or neutral mortality risk among those receiving neurohormonal blockade. Tests for interaction indicate that neurohormonal blockade may attenuate the relationship between high BMI and increased mortality risk. Neurohormonal blockade may thus partly explain the so-called obesity paradox.", 
    "43": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers antagonists (ARAs) are widely used compounds in various cardiovascular disorders. ACEIs, but not ARAs, inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase which is involved in the conversion of angiotensin I to II and degradation of kinins like bradykinin and substance P. Bradykinin and substance P are potent mediators of inflammation and pain. Hence the study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of captopril (an ACEI) and losartan (an ARA-AT1 receptor antagonist) on thermal and chemical induced nocioception by employing hot plate and acetic acid induced writhing tests respectively in mice. Inbred albino mice weighing between 25-30 g were used and they were divided into two sets, each set containing 7 groups. Control groups received normal saline and the remaining six groups received three doses (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) of captopril and three doses (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) of losartan. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally fifteen minutes before placing the animal over the hot plate or 30 minutes before injecting 0.6% acetic acid. Both drugs dose dependently reduced the reaction time in hot plate method. In chemical induced writhing test, both the drugs reduced the latency of onset of writhing and in captopril pretreated groups, acetic acid induced sustained abdominal contraction without any intermittent relaxation. However, in losartan pretreated animals acetic acid just increased the number of writhings without sustained abdominal contraction. Thus, our study suggests that both drugs have hyperalgesic effects.", 
    "44": "The goal of this study was to compare the effects of lisinopril, losartan, and their combination on microalbuminuria in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups: group 1 (n=9), group 2 (n=9), and group 3 (n=8) received 10 mg lisinopril, 50 mg losartan, and 10 mg lisinopril plus 50 mg losartan, respectively, each day. For 12 mo, the 24-h urine albumin excretion rate was assessed at 3-mo intervals. At study completion, the urine albumin excretion rate had been reduced significantly in each group (P=.001); however, no significant differences were noted among groups (P=.587). Investigators in the present study have concluded that lisinopril, losartan, and their combination have similar effects on microalbuminuria in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and that combination therapy does not provide additional benefit.",

Sensitivity and specificity to detect RAS were compared for each technique on both a patient and kidney basis. Discrepancies were evaluated separately and classified as borderline, method dependent, or operator dependent.",

The sensitivity/specificity of ultrasonography, captopril renography, CTA, and MRA in detecting kidneys with RAS was 73/71%, 52/63%, 94/62%, and 93/91%, respectively. Ultrasonography had a significantly lower sensitivity than CTA and MRA (P<0.001) but higher than captopril renography (P = 0.013). Borderline RAS was the main cause for discrepancies.", 
    "48": "MRA and CTA were significantly better than duplex ultrasonography and captopril renography in detecting hemodynamically significant RAS. The ultrasonography criteria for RAS based on the evaluation of renal peak systolic velocity and renal/aortic ratio are questionable. Captopril renography cannot be recommended for assessing RAS.", 
    "49": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), a bioactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the Ang II forming enzyme, or specific blockade of Ang II binding to angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) through which it exerts its deleterious effects, were shown to provide some protection against progression of CVD. The ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis has been challenged over the last few years with RAAS components able to counterbalance the effects of the main axis. The ACE homologue ACE2 efficiently hydrolyses Ang II to form Ang (1-7), a peptide that exerts actions opposite to those of Ang II. In contrast to the Ang II axis, the role of the ACE2-Ang (1-7) axis in cardiac function is largely obscure. Ang (1-7) is present in the viable myocardium, and its formation depends on Ang II as a substrate. The expression of this peptide is associated with cardiac remodeling: it is lost in the infarcted area and significantly increased in the border area. Low doses of Ang (1-7) improve cardiac output and antagonize Ang II-induced vasoconstriction. The type of Ang (1-7) biological activity is tissue specific and dose dependent. These findings point to a possible protective role for Ang (1-7) in abating the Ang II-induced actions. The elevated expression of Ang (1-7) in failing heart tissue paralleled the expression of its forming enzyme, ACE2. Several observations and experimental evidence suggest a beneficial role for ACE2 in cardiovascular function. Elevated ACE2 expression at the initial stage of several pathologies which decline with progression of disease might indicate a protective role for ACE2. Genetic manipulation of ACE2 expression, either targeted disruption or overexpression, point to the possible significance of this enzyme in cardiac function. Based on the above, a therapeutic approach that will amplify the ACE2-Ang (1-7) axis could provide further protection against the development of CVD. It turns out that the merits of currently used drugs--ACE inhibitors, AT1R blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRB) - lay beyond their direct effects on suppression of the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis as they also increase cardiac ACE2 and Ang (1-7) significantly.",

Western blot was used to analyze target protein expression in the kidney.", 
    "52": "MAP responses to AT1 receptor inhibition and exogenous Ang II were attenuated in castrated NZGH. The increase in RVR (mm Hg/ml/min/g kidney) at the maximum dose of Ang II was significantly lower in castrated NZGH than in sham operated NZGH. Testosterone replacement restored RVR responses to Ang II in castrated rats. Fasudil treatment reduced both MAP and RVR responses to Ang II in each group. In addition, the differential MAP and RVR responses to Ang II amongst the three groups were significantly attenuated by Rho kinase inhibition. Western blot showed that Rho kinase protein expression was reduced by castration, while testosterone replacement restored the Rho kinase protein levels in castrated rats. The phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), a downstream target of Rho kinase, was also increased by androgens.",

The antihypertensive effect of omapatrilat/MO-nanoparticles in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after oral administration was evaluated. The results indicated that the variables involved in the process did not have an influence on particle size, and that the former is directly determined by the amphiphilic properties of MO. When SHR were orally treated with omapatrilat/MO-nanoparticles, blood pressure was significantly reduced and completely normalized after three days. This effect was markedly higher than that observed with omapatrilat suspensions. The effect of omapatrilat/MO-nanoparticles can be attributed to: (i) The molecular dispersion of the drug into the lipophilic domain of monolein's bicontinuous phase; (ii) the adhesive properties of the nanodispersion on the gastrointestinal mucosa; (iii) the high surface area of the dispersion; (iv) the intraluminal interaction between MO, the mixed micelles arising from the digestive process, and omapatrilat; and (v) the well-known absorption-promoting properties of lipids, and in particular, of MO.

It is therefore important to find a well-tolerated and economic therapy capable of decreasing their risk of high proteinuria and blood pressure levels. The aim of this multicenter open-label randomized clinical trial is to test whether blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) decreases the risk of progression in patients aged 3-60 years with biopsy-proven benign IgA glomerulonephritis, proteinuria levels of 0.3-0.9 g/24 hours, and normal renal function and blood pressure. The RAS is blocked by first using a single drug class (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker), and then combining the 2 classes as soon as the 1-drug blockade has become ineffective. We plan to enroll 378 patients over the next 3 years and randomize them to receive ramipril 5 mg/day (3 mg/m2 in children) (group A), irbesartan 300 mg/day (175 mg/m 2 in children) (group B) or supportive therapy (group C); if an increase in proteinuria of at least 50% from baseline is detected after 6 months of treatment, the other RAS inhibitor will be added.

From normal to overt proteinuria levels, albuminuria shows a continuous marked increase in cardiovascular risk. This association is independent of other \"classical\" cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia or smoking. Furthermore it has a predictive value not only for patients with diabetic or renal disease, but also for hypertensive individuals or the general population. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to display not only reno--but also cardioprotective effects.

The ARB ameliorates the CHF by decreasing oxidative stress [Funabiki K, et al., Combined angiotensin receptor blocker and ACE inhibitor on myocardial fibrosis and LV stiffness in dogs with heart failure, Am J Physiol, 2004; 287(6): H2487-92].

    "79": "Our previous microdialysis study demonstrated that both ethanol (EtOH) and acetaldehyde (ACe) decrease in vivo acetylcholine (ACh) release in the medial frontal cortex of freely moving rats. To better understand the mechanisms of EtOH and ACe's effects on the cholinergic system in the brain, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression was examined at 40 and 240 min after a dose of EtOH (1 g/kg) in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. The control group was treated with 0.9% saline, and other groups received EtOH or cyanamide (CY, 50 mg/kg, a potent aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor) and 60 min later by EtOH intraperitoneally. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that ChAT mRNA levels were decreased by 72.8% and 71.6% in the EtOH and CY+EtOH groups, respectively, at 40 min after EtOH injection compared with saline in the frontal cortex. The hippocampal ChAT levels were reduced by 76.5% and 53.0% in the EtOH and CY+EtOH groups, respectively, at this time. CY+EtOH-induced depletion in ChAT mRNA levels was markedly higher than EtOH in the hippocampus. A similar decrease pattern of ChAT was observed at protein levels as determined by Western blot, but the reduced ChAT levels were significantly higher in the CY+EtOH group as compared with the EtOH group both in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. At 240 min after EtOH injection, the EtOH group had no effect on ChAT at mRNA levels, as compared with saline, whereas CY+EtOH group induced a significant decrease in ChAT mRNA expression to 62.0% and 65.5% in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, respectively. These data were consistent with the results of the Western blot analysis. AChE expression at mRNA levels was not changed at either 40 or 240 min after EtOH dosing in either of these groups in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Within 40 and 240 min, a statistically significant difference in ChAT expression at mRNA and protein levels was found in the EtOH and CY+EtOH groups both in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The data obtained from this study demonstrate that EtOH and ACe concentrations decreased ChAT expression at 40 and 240 min after EtOH administration in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and this result suggests that reduced ChAT expression is strongly related to a decrease in ACh release in the rat brain.",

We report the case of a 37-year-old man with recently diagnosed scleroderma who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. He was found to have scleroderma renal crisis as well as cardiac tamponade. He responded hemodynamically to emergent pericardiocentesis and blood pressure control with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. However, the renal function deteriorated further leading to development of end-stage renal disease and required chronic hemodialysis.Although pericardial effusions are common in scleroderma, cardiac tamponade is rare. Coexistent hypertension and cardiac tamponade in scleroderma have not been described previously. Elevated systemic blood pressure can accompany and should not be used to exclude the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. We emphasize the importance of pericardial disease as an uncommon but important cause of chest pain in patients with scleroderma.", 
    "88": "Macula densa cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandins serve as important modulators of the renin-angiotensin system, and cross-talk exists between these two systems. Cortical COX-2 induction by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or AT(1) receptor blockers (ARBs) suggests that angiotensin II may inhibit cortical COX-2 by stimulating the AT(1) receptor pathway. In the present studies we determined that chronic infusion of either hypertensive or nonhypertensive concentrations of angiotensin II attenuated cortical COX-2. Angiotensin II infusion reversed cortical COX-2 elevation induced by ACE inhibitors. However, we found that angiotensin II infusion further stimulated cortical COX-2 elevation induced by ARBs, suggesting a potential role for an AT(2) receptor-mediated pathway when the AT(1) receptor was inhibited. Both WT and AT(2) receptor knockout mice were treated for 7 days with either ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Cortical COX-2 increased to similar levels in response to ACE inhibition in both knockout and WT mice. In WT mice ARBs increased cortical COX-2 more than ACE inhibitors, and this stimulation was attenuated by the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319. In the knockout mice ARBs led to significantly less cortical COX-2 elevation, which was not attenuated by PD123319. PCR confirmed AT(1a) and AT(2) receptor expression in the cultured macula densa cell line MMDD1. Angiotensin II inhibited MMDD1 COX-2, and CGP42112A, an AT(2) receptor agonist, stimulated MMDD1 COX-2. In summary, these results demonstrate that macula densa COX-2 expression is oppositely regulated by AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and suggest that AT(2) receptor-mediated cortical COX-2 elevation may mediate physiologic effects that modulate AT(1)-mediated responses.", 
    "89": "Human angiotensin-converting enzyme is an important drug target for which little structural information has been available until recent years. The slow progress in obtaining a crystal structure was due to the problem of surface glycosylation, a difficulty that has thus far been overcome by the use of a glucosidase-1 inhibitor in the tissue culture medium. However, the prohibitive cost of these inhibitors and incomplete glucosidase inhibition makes alternative routes to minimizing the N-glycan heterogeneity desirable. Here, glycosylation in the testis isoform (tACE) has been reduced by Asn-Gln point mutations at N-glycosylation sites, and the crystal structures of mutants having two and four intact sites have been solved to 2.0 A and 2.8 A, respectively. Both mutants show close structural identity with the wild-type. A hinge mechanism is proposed for substrate entry into the active cleft, based on homology to human ACE2 at the levels of sequence and flexibility. This is supported by normal-mode analysis that reveals intrinsic flexibility about the active site of tACE. Subdomain II, containing bound chloride and zinc ions, is found to have greater stability than subdomain I in the structures of three ACE homologues. Crystallizable glycosylation mutants open up new possibilities for cocrystallization studies to aid the design of novel ACE inhibitors.",

    "94": "Premature cardiovascular disease is the largest cause of mortality, and a major cause of morbidity, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at extreme risk, but cardiovascular event rates are increased even in early CKD. There is little controlled trial evidence on which to base treatment, as most therapeutic trials have excluded CKD patients. Current treatment strategies are therefore based upon small prospective studies or retrospective analyses of controlled trials and registry data. It is thus unclear whether CKD patients benefit from modern secondary preventive treatments in the same manner as patients with normal renal function. There is a need for randomized trials to identify effective drugs to prevent and treat coronary artery disease in CKD. Revascularization by CABG in CKD has been widely reported in registry data to provide better results than medical treatment or angioplasty. Recent angioplasty data in patients with CKD, however, show improving results, and the risks of CABG in CKD remain high. It is not clear which revascularization technique has a better outcome in patients 'equally suitable' on angiographic criteria for either procedure. The high rate of late adverse cardiovascular events after both CABG and angioplasty accentuates the need for effective secondary preventive therapy disease in these high-risk patients.", 
    "95": "Recent studies indicate that adding the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone (SP) to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or ACEI and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), which is known as a triple blockade, enhances the more beneficial effects on urinary protein excretion of patients with chronic kidney diseases. In this study, we explored the effects of SP on urinary protein excretion in patients with Alport syndrome featuring persistent proteinuria in spite of the long-term use of ACEI (lisinopril) or both ACEI and ARB (candesartan). Five patients with Alport syndrome were enrolled and SP treatment (25 mg/day) was started. At the start of SP administration, all patients showed good renal function and none of them suffered from hypertension. We decided to assess the effect of SP by determining the morning urinary protein/creatinine ratio (U-P/C) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR). After SP treatment was started, U-P/C was significantly reduced at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months, while EGFR did not change. The drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was statistically significant and serum potassium level was slightly elevated. None of the patients showed signs of severe hyperkalemia (>5.0 mEq/l). These results suggest that aldosterone receptor blockade combined with ACEI and ARB therapy offers a valuable adjuvant treatment for the reduction of proteinuria in patients with Alport syndrome as in those with other chronic kidney diseases. SP can thus be expected to constitute a good renoprotective agent for Alport syndrome. These preliminary data indicate that large-scale trials of this therapy should be done.",

However such reports markedly diminished after the onset of ACE inhibitor use. Recently, reports again have surfaced that describe scleroderma patients presenting with clinical evidence of TTP. We describe a 50-year-old female with longstanding limited cutaneous scleroderma who presented with hematochezia and thrombocytopenia along with other findings suggesting TTP. A colon biopsy revealed thrombi within the lumen. Her course was complicated by renal failure and hypertension that did not respond to ACE inhibitor therapy alone. She improved after a course of plasma exchange. She was discharged home only to return 2 months later with grand mal seizures and hypertension. During her course she developed adult respiratory distress syndrome. She again responded to plasma exchange and she was discharged home. She has remained stable for 2 years. This report emphasizes the importance of fully evaluating patients with longstanding limited cutaneous scleroderma who present with renal failure, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia in association with multiorgan complications. All possible etiologies, including SRC, TTP, vasculitis, and sepsis should be considered. Tissue biopsies (in this case, a colon biopsy revealed thrombi within the vessel lumen) may prove beneficial in assisting with the diagnosis.

Control of hypertension in both of these settings may attenuate progressive LV hypertrophy and remodeling and improve clinical outcomes. Guidelines for the management of heart failure recommend that hypertension should be treated in all patients with preclinical heart failure as well as in those with heart failure with reduced or preserved LV systolic function. Consistent with national hypertension guidelines, the goal for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with heart failure is less than 140/90 mm Hg, but lower targets (< 130/80 mm Hg) may be desirable in those with concomitant diabetes mellitus or renal disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists are first-line options for hypertension treatment in heart failure. Calcium channel antagonists and the alpha blocker doxazosin should be avoided. Episodes of recurrent pulmonary edema and hypertension may also indicate underlying severe renovascular disease that may respond to percutaneous renal artery intervention.",

We found that in a consequence of uniformed antihypertensive therapy which in patients lasted minimum one year and consisted of one of ACE inhibitors (enalapril or perindopril or captopril), one of beta-antagonists (metoprolol or bisoprolol) and diuretic agent (indapamid), while SHR lasted 8 days and consisted of ACE inhibitor (chinapril), blood pressure lowered and red blood cell rheology was significantly improved. For the first time we observed that antihypertensive treatment which advantageously decreased the aggregability of erythrocytes was diminished by a high dose of aspirin (300 mg/day).", 
    "104": "Regular endurance training has established itself as a major therapeutic principle in the specter of nonpharmacological measures in arterial hypertension. An initial medical check as well as an adequate technique, dosage and intensity of the prescribed exercise training are mandatory. With respect to the concomitant pharmacological treatment, it should be considered that the beneficial effects of lifestyle modification will not be counteracted by the chosen antihypertensive drug but, ideally, synergistically supported. Based on the individual clinical situation, principally all antihypertensive drugs recommended by the current European guidelines, may be prescribed as mono- or combination therapy.beta-receptor blockers are especially capable of controlling excessive exercise-induced blood pressure increase; however, they have metabolic and exercise physiological limitations. The neutrality concerning metabolic and exercise physiological parameters as well as the positive profile of side effects favor ACE inhibitors, long-acting calcium channel blockers and especially AT(1) antagonists in physically active hypertensive patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome.", 
    "105": "Experimental evidence suggests that aldosterone contributes to progressive kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists suppress the renin-angiotensin system but they do not effectively reduce plasma aldosterone. Hence, administration of aldosterone receptor antagonists may provide additional renal protection. In the present prospective randomized open-label study, we evaluated the effects of spironolactone (25 mg/day for 1 year) on proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate in 83 patients with chronic kidney disease already treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists. Eighty-two patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists alone and served as controls. After 1 year of therapy, proteinuria decreased from 2.1+/-0.08 to 0.89+/-0.06 g/g creatinine (P<0.001) in patients treated with spironolactone, but it did not change in control patients. Baseline aldosterone levels were significantly correlated with proteinuria (r=0.76, P<0.0001), and predicted the degree of reduction in proteinuria with spironolactone (r=0.42, P<0.0002). Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was similar in patients treated with spironolactone and controls (62.4+/-2.4 and 62.2+/-2.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively). After 1 month of therapy with spironolactone, estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased more in patients treated with spironolactone than in controls. However, by the end of 1 year the monthly rate of decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline was lower in patients treated with spironolactone than in controls (0.323+/-0.044 vs 0.474+/-0.037 ml/min/1.73 m(2), P<0.01). Spironolactone caused a significant rise in serum potassium levels (from 4.2+/-0.04 at baseline to 5.0+/-0.05 mEq/l after 12 months of treatment, P<0.001). In conclusion, this study has shown that spironolactone may reduce proteinuria and retard renal progression in chronic kidney disease patients.", 
    "106": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is one of the most powerful maneuvers to slow progression of renal disease. Angiotensin II (AngII) has emerged in the past decade as a multifunctional cytokine that exhibits many nonhemodynamic properties, such as acting as a growth factor and profibrogenic cytokine, and even having proinflammatory properties. Many of these deleterious functions are mediated by other factors, such as TGF-beta and chemoattractants that are induced in the kidney by AngII. Moreover, understanding of the RAAS has become much more complex in recent years with the identification of novel peptides (e.g., AngIV) that could bind to specific receptors, elucidating deleterious effects, and non-angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-mediated generation of AngII. The ability of renal cells to produce AngII in a concentration that is much higher than what is found in the systemic circulation and the observation that aldosterone may be engaged directly in profibrogenic processes independent of hypertension have added to the complexity of the RAAS. Even renin has now been identified to have a \"life on its own\" and mediates profibrotic effects via binding to specific receptors. Finally, drugs that are used to block the RAAS, such as ACE inhibitors or certain AngII type 1 receptor antagonists, may have properties on cells independent of AngII (ACE inhibitor-mediated outside-inside signaling and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma stimulatory effects of certain sartanes). Although blockade of the RAAS with ACE inhibitors, AngII type 1 receptor antagonists, or the combination of both should be part of every strategy to slow progression of renal disease, a better understanding of the novel aspects of the RAAS should contribute to the development of innovative strategies not only to completely halt progression but also to induce regression of human renal disease.", 
    "107": "It was reported recently that treatment of kidney transplant recipients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) is associated with strikingly improved long-term graft and patient survival. This finding has important implications for future posttransplantation therapy recommendations. In an analysis of 17,209 kidney and 1744 heart transplant recipients, an association of treatment with ACEI/ARB with improved transplant outcome could not be confirmed. It is concluded that recommendations for a widespread use of ACEI/ARB treatment in transplant recipients are unwarranted.", 
    "108": "We describe a comprehensive translational approach for identifying candidate genes for alcoholism. The approach relies on the cross-matching of animal model brain gene expression data with human genetic linkage data, as well as human tissue data and biological roles data, an approach termed convergent functional genomics. An analysis of three animal model paradigms, based on inbred alcohol-preferring (iP) and alcohol-non-preferring (iNP) rats, and their response to treatments with alcohol, was used. A comprehensive analysis of microarray gene expression data from five key brain regions (frontal cortex, amygdala, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus) was carried out. The Bayesian-like integration of multiple independent lines of evidence, each by itself lacking sufficient discriminatory power, led to the identification of high probability candidate genes, pathways and mechanisms for alcoholism. These data reveal that alcohol has pleiotropic effects on multiple systems, which may explain the diverse neuropsychiatric and medical pathology in alcoholism. Some of the pathways identified suggest avenues for pharmacotherapy of alcoholism with existing agents, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Experiments we carried out in alcohol-preferring rats with an ACE inhibitor show a marked modulation of alcohol intake. Other pathways are new potential targets for drug development. The emergent overall picture is that physical and physiological robustness may permit alcohol-preferring individuals to withstand the aversive effects of alcohol. In conjunction with a higher reactivity to its rewarding effects, they may able to ingest enough of this nonspecific drug for a strong hedonic and addictive effect to occur.",

The plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, arginine vasopressin (AVP) and angiotensin II, and haemodynamic variables were measured before (T1) and 15 min after (T2) the start of CPB, before aortic unclamping (T3) and at skin closure (T4).

Compared with the control group, the AVP level was lower at T1 in the ARA group and at T2 in the ARA and ACEI groups. The angiotensin II level was higher at T1, T2 and T3 in ARA group compared with ACEI and control groups. There were no significant differences in the epinephrine and norepinephrine levels among the three groups. The amount of administered phenylephrine during CPB was greater and MAP was lower in the ARA group compared with the ACEI and control groups.",

    "113": "Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for stroke, including first-ever and recurrent stroke. The association between blood pressure (BP) and stroke risk is continuous and may be documented as low as 115/75 mm Hg. Because of this continuum of risk, and because most strokes occur in individuals with mild hypertension or even normal BP values, we are now beginning to recognize \"prehypertension\" as a stage in which early recognition and intervention may confer benefit. In addition to increased risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, hypertension may be associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment. Reductions in BP are reliably associated with reduced stroke risk. Some evidence suggests that certain agents, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, may have protective effects beyond BP lowering. Overall, the degree of BP lowering is key, and therefore most classes of BP-lowering agents may be recommended at this point. Many patients with hypertension will require more than one BP-lowering agent to control BP. Lifestyle modification is appropriate at all levels of intervention. Further studies are needed to ascertain the mechanisms of benefit of different classes of antihypertensive agents in the reduction of stroke and cardiovascular disease risk.",

The AdRem study is based on seven-field stereoscopic retinal photographs of both eyes. These are taken within 3 months after randomization in ADVANCE (baseline), at the biennial and at the final visit. The primary outcome is progression of two or more steps in ETDRS classification. Secondary outcomes include progression of retinal vascular lesions and distortion of retinal vascular geometry. Retinal photographs are made on film and digitized at a central laboratory. The AdRem study uses fully digitized quality control and grading. Between August 2002 and January 2004 1978 patients were included in the AdRem study, from 39 centers in 14 countries. Approximately 85% comply with the strict AdRem quality requirements. Publication of the results is expected in early 2008.

    "128": "Hepatic steatosis is a recognized problem in patients after orthotopic liver transplant (OLT). However, de novo development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been well described. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of de novo NAFLD after OLT. A retrospective analysis was performed on 68 OLT patients with donor liver biopsies and posttransplantation liver biopsies. Individual medical charts were reviewed for demographics, indication for OLT, serial histology reports, genotypes for hepatitis C, comorbid conditions, and medications. Liver biopsies were reviewed blindly and graded according to the Brunt Scoring System. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study the risk factors for developing NAFLD. The interval time from OLT to subsequent follow-up liver biopsy was 28 +/- 18 months. A total of 12 patients (18%) developed de novo NAFLD, and 6 (9%) developed de novo NASH. The regression model indicated that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) was associated with a reduced risk of developing NAFLD after OLT (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.010-0.92; P = 0.042). Increase in body mass index (BMI) of greater than 10% after OLT was associated with a higher risk of developing NAFLD (odds ratio, 19.38; 95% confidence interval, 3.50-107.40; P = 0.001). In conclusion, de novo NAFLD is common in the post-OLT setting, with a significant association with weight gain after transplant. The use of an ACE-I may reduce the risk of developing post-OLT NAFLD.", 
    "129": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is caused by upper airway collapse during inspiration, causing intermittent hypoxemia, hypercapnia, acidosis, sympathetic nervous system activation, and arousal from sleep. Nighttime blood pressure is higher, but unexpectedly, daytime hypertension occurs. The prevalence of hypertension is very high and the incidence of hypertension increases as the number of apneic and hypopneic events per hour rises. Obesity is a major predisposing factor for the development of obstructive sleep apnea. Daytime sleepiness, snoring, and breathing pauses are important symptoms to elicit from the patient or sleep partner. Resistant hypertension is an important clue. Overnight polysomnography is required for diagnosis. Weight loss, avoidance of nocturnal sedatives, cessation of evening alcohol ingestion, and avoidance of the supine position during sleep are initial therapeutic actions in mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice for patients unable to find relief from lifestyle changes. Blood pressure modestly improves with treatment.", 
    "130": "Many antihypertensive drugs have important interactions with drugs used for different purposes; when these are used concomitantly, adverse effects on blood pressure can result. Fortunately, in recent years, the drug development process has generally discouraged the approval and marketing of antihypertensive drugs with this problem, although some anomalies still exist (eg, telmisartan + digoxin). Physicians who work in emergency departments are more familiar with illicit or unregulated drugs that affect blood pressure; chief among these are cocaine and other opioids, and methylphenidate and its congeners. The most important prescription drugs that affect blood pressure are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including selective inhibitors of the second isoform of cyclooxygenase) and steroids. Phenylpropanolamines, some antidepressants, and sibutramine can often be avoided, as they raise blood pressure in a significant proportion of those who take them. Conversely, the hypertensive effects of calcineurin inhibitors and erythropoietin are most commonly overcome by increasing the intensity of antihypertensive drug treatment, since these drugs are essentially unavoidable in most patients who receive them.", 
    "131": "Insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension are associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Lifestyle modifications effectively decrease the risk of progression to diabetes in high-risk patients, but intensive interventions can be costly and difficult for patients to maintain. The addition of pharmacotherapy is often necessary to treat hyperglycemia and hypertension and lower the risk of cardiovascular complications. Clinical trial data suggest the use of insulin-sensitizing and antihyperglycemic agents to delay the progression to diabetes. Similarly, analysis of data from clinical trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers indicate that the use of these agents results in fewer cases of new-onset diabetes among patients with hypertension, when compared with other antihypertensive agents. Angiotensin II has direct and indirect effects on insulin and its signaling pathways, providing support for the biologic mechanism underlying the benefits of renin-angiotensin system inhibition in preventing diabetes and cardiovascular events. Clinical trials now under way will further evaluate the role of renin-angiotensin system inhibition in preventing diabetes and its microvascular and macrovascular complications.",

There was an increase in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in diabetics but no other condition affected drug choice. Although there was an increase in the use of diuretics as initial therapy in 2003 and 2004, this decreased in 2005. The increase in initial diuretic use was not reflected in patterns of ongoing antihypertensive use from 1997 to 2005.

The 2K1C rats received by gavage one of the following: water, ramipril, losartan, atenolol, amlodipine, or hydrochlorothiazide. Sham-operated normotensive rats received water. After 15 days of treatment AP was continuously sampled from an indwelling catheter in awake rats during a 2-h period and systolic AP and pulse interval (PI) were submitted to autoregressive spectral analysis with oscillatory components quantified in low (LF: 0.25 to 0.75 Hz) and high (HF: 0.75 to 3.0 Hz) frequency bands. The AP measured by tail-cuff was 170 +/- 2 mm Hg in 2K1C and 131 +/- 3 mm Hg in normotensive rats. Pooled data indicated that all antihypertensive agents reduced the AP of 2K1C rats to 127 +/- 2 mm Hg, whereas 2K1C rats treated with water remained hypertensive (206 +/- 11 mm Hg). Variance of systolic AP was found increased in 2K1C rats treated with water (34 +/- 2 mm Hg2), whereas 2K1C rats treated with ramipril, atenolol, amlodipine, or hydrochlorothiazide presented AP variance similar to normotensive rats (16 +/- 2 mm Hg2). Losartan normalized AP of 2K1C rats but variance of systolic AP remained increased (34 +/- 7 mm Hg2). The 2K1C rats treated with water had increased LF of systolic AP, whereas 2K1C rats treated with losartan showed higher LF of systolic AP and PI. Atenolol presented lower LF and higher HF of PI. In conclusion, losartan normalized AP but did not reduce AP variability, suggesting an autonomic imbalance characterized by higher sympathetic modulation of the cardiovascular system.",

    "140": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis in vertebrates. Production of the precursor protein, angiotensinogen, is regulated by other components within the RAS. Angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates the production and secretion of angiotensinogen in many mammalian models. However, the existence of a similar positive feedback mechanism for angiotensinogen has not been demonstrated for any non-mammalian species. In the present study, we have cloned the angiotensinogen for silver sea bream (Sparus sarba) and investigated the role of Ang II on angiotensinogen expression. The nucleotide sequence of angiotensinogen for S. sarba only exhibits a fair resemblance to other fish angiotensinogens and shows 76.6% similarity to that of Takifugu rubripes and 57.2% similarity to that of Danio rerio. Angiotensinogen transcripts have been identified in the brain, liver, kidney, and various parts of the intestine of sea bream, an observation, which probably implies the presence of a local RAS at the tissue level. The liver is probably the major source of angiotensinogen, as it exhibits the highest angiotensinogen transcript abundance among different tissues. Differential angiotensinogen expression was found among different regions of the intestine where the pyloric caeca exhibits the highest expression. Putative Ang I is identified at the N-terminal of the deduced protein with a novel sequence [Asn1, Ile5, His9]-Ang I. Hepatic angiotensinogen expression in sea bream adapted to different salinities remained constant and this is probably due to desensitization of the angiotensin receptors by angiotensin. A positive feedback mechanism of angiotensinogen by Ang II has been demonstrated as exogenous Ang II increased the amount of angiotensinogen transcript in isolated hepatocytes in vitro. Blockade of endogenous RAS by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, significantly lowered the hepatic expression of angiotensinogen in vivo. The effect of Ang II stimulation on angiotensinogen expression is more potent in fish than that in mammals. These data suggest that the positive feedback mechanism of angiotensinogen by Ang II has already evolved in teleosts and such mechanism may be involved in the maintenance of angiotensinogen secretion under resting and hypertensive conditions.",

The study group (I) consisted of 20 children with SDNS aged 5-18 years, with a subsequent proteinuria relapse at the time of prednisone dose reduction. All nephrotic syndrome (NS) children were examined three times: A--at proteinuria relapse, before CyA treatment; B--after 3 months; C--after 12 months of CyA administration. The control group (II) consisted of 20 healthy children. CD3/P-gp was measured using a flow cytometry assay. The serum CyA level was assessed by means of the immunofluorescence method. The expression of CD3/P-gp in NS relapse, prior to CyA+ACE-I administration, was much higher (median 9.15%, range 1.50-13.50%) when compared to healthy controls (median 1.20%, range 0.30-5.70%). The absolute number of CD3/P-gp in this examination was almost five times higher when compared to healthy controls (p<0.01). After 3 months of CyA+ACE-I therapy, the expression of CD3/P-gp decreased dramatically and was similar to the controls. Similar results were obtained after 12 months of treatment. A strong negative correlation was found between CD3/P-gp and serum CyA concentration in both examinations (r=-0.624, p<0.01; r=-0.464, p<0.01). We conclude that the results of our studies indicate that CyA+ACE-I in SDNS inhibits the expression of P-gp. CyA is an alternative therapy that may lead to the optimization of glucocorticoid (GC) doses, thus, reducing the risk that is associated with the treatment.",

In humans, deletions spanning the TFII-I locus are associated with a cognitive defect, the Williams-Beuren cognitive profile. We report an unanticipated role of TFII-I outside the nucleus as a negative regulator of agonist-induced calcium entry (ACE) that suppresses surface accumulation of TRPC3 (transient receptor potential C3) channels. Inhibition of ACE by TFII-I requires phosphotyrosine residues that engage the SH2 (Src-homology 2) domains of phospholipase C-g (PLC-g) and an interrupted, pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain that binds the split PH domain of PLC-g.

Urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is a well-established marker of microalbuminuria and can be conveniently performed on the DCA 2000 point-of-care testing (POCT) analyser (Bayer Australia; Melbourne, VIC, Australia) with an on-site result available in 7 min. The application of the urine ACR POCT for renal disease risk assessment was pioneered by our group in the Umoona Kidney Project. This article describes the results of the management arm of the Umoona Kidney Project, which used point-of-care urine ACR testing for the first time within a management framework to monitor albuminuria in patients at highest risk of renal disease. The article also examines the analytical quality of POCT results and overall community acceptance of the Umoona Kidney Project.", 
    "153": "Adults clinically assessed by Flinders Medical Centre renal specialists as being at greatest risk for renal disease were offered the ACE inhibitor (ACEI) perindopril on a voluntary basis. Selected renal markers, including POCT urine ACR (conducted on-site by Umoona's Aboriginal health worker team), plasma electrolytes, urea, creatinine, calculated glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure were measured six monthly. Regular quality control testing was undertaken to monitor the analytical performance of the POCT analyser. A culturally appropriate questionnaire was designed and implemented to assess community satisfaction with the project.", 
    "154": "In all, 231 patient management consultations were conducted over a two year period, with over 70% of patients having four or more (up to a maximum of eight) consultations; 35 patients (mean age 49.2 [+/-2.3] years, 54% males) participated voluntarily in the management arm. All were overtly hypertensive, hypertensive with other risk factors or had diabetes. The renal status of these patients was followed for a mean of 63 +/- 4.5 weeks. In total, 111 POCT urine ACR tests were performed for patient management (mean 3.2 tests per patient). There was no significant difference in POCT urine ACR in the study period with a median (and inter-quartile range) of 5.7 mg/mmol (1.2-15.2) pre-ACEI and 4.3 mg/mmol (1.3-16.7) post-ACEI treatment (p = 0.50, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). The calculated glomerular filtration rate altered from 110 to 118 mL/min (p = 0.019, paired t-test). There was no change in the group plasma potassium, urea and creatinine. Collectively these results indicate a stabilisation in renal function among the management group. Blood pressure (both lying and standing) fell significantly in the study period. The imprecision for urine ACR quality control POCT conducted during the management program was within nationally and internationally accepted precision goals for urine albumin, creatinine and ACR. Fifty community members completed the satisfaction questionnaire. Three-quarters of respondents felt there were no cultural barriers in providing a urine sample for urine ACR POCT.",

    "156": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression has been shown to be altered in renal tubules from diabetic mice. This study examined the localization of ACE and ACE2 within the glomerulus of kidneys from control (db/m) and diabetic (db/db) mice and the effect of chronic pharmacologic ACE2 inhibition. ACE2 co-localized with glomerular epithelial cell (podocyte) markers, and its localization within the podocyte was confirmed by immunogold labeling. ACE, by contrast, was seen only in glomerular endothelial cells. By immunohistochemistry, in glomeruli from db/db mice, strong ACE staining was found more frequently than in control mice (db/db 64.6 +/- 6.3 versus db/m 17.8 +/- 3.4%; P < 0.005). By contrast, strong ACE2 staining in glomeruli from diabetic mice was less frequently seen than in controls (db/db 4.3 +/- 2.4 versus db/m 30.6 +/- 13.6%; P < 0.05). For investigation of the significance of reduced glomerular ACE2 expression, db/db mice were treated for 16 wk with a specific ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760) alone or combined with telmisartan, a specific angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker. At the end of the study, glomerular staining for fibronectin, an extracellular matrix protein, was increased in both db/db and db/m mice that were treated with MLN-4760. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) increased significantly in MLN-4760-treated as compared with vehicle-treated db/db mice (743 +/- 200 versus 247 +/- 53.9 microg albumin/mg creatinine, respectively; P < 0.05), and the concomitant administration of telmisartan completely prevented the increase in UAE associated with the ACE2 inhibitor (161 +/- 56; P < 0.05). It is concluded that ACE2 is localized in the podocyte and that in db/db mice glomerular expression of ACE2 is reduced whereas glomerular ACE expression is increased. The finding that chronic ACE2 inhibition increases UAE suggests that ACE2, likely by modulating the levels of glomerular angiotensin II via its degradation, may be a target for therapeutic interventions that aim to reduce albuminuria and glomerular injury.", 
    "157": "Recent studies suggest that cardiac myocyte apoptosis contributes to the progress of CHF (congestive heart failure). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that metoprolol in conjunction with the standard treatment regime for CHF [an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor, diuretics and digoxin] may significantly reduce the plasma concentrations of the apoptotic mediators sFas (soluble Fas) and sFasL (soluble Fas ligand) in patients with CHF. An ELISA was used to determine the plasma concentrations of sFas and sFasL in 106 patients with stable CHF at recruitment. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and after 1 year of treatment with metoprolol in conjunction with the standard treatment regime for CHF (i.e. an ACE inhibitor, diuretics and digoxin). The dose of metoprolol was doubled on a biweekly basis up to 50 mg twice a day or maintained at the maximum tolerated dose. Data after 1 year were available for 92 patients and were analysed. The plasma concentrations of sFas and sFasL in patients with CHF decreased significantly (P<0.01) after 1 year of treatment with metoprolol in conjunction with the standard treatment regime compared with at baseline (5.4+/-0.2 compared with 3.2+/-0.1 ng/ml respectively for sFas, and 52.1+/-2.3 compared with 26.7+/-1.0 pg/ml respectively for sFasL). Compared with baseline, after 1 year of treatment with metoprolol in conjunction with the standard treatment regime there were significant improvements in LV (left ventricular) ejection fraction (from 32.6+/-0.9 to 51.5+/-0.8%; P<0.01), LV end-diastolic dimension (from 69.8+/-0.6 to 57.7+/-0.3 mm; P<0.01), LV end-systolic dimension (from 53.9+/-0.6 to 40.5+/-0.5 mm; P<0.01), LV end-diastolic volume (from 254.7+/-5.0 to 164.1+/-2.2 ml; P<0.01) and LV end-systolic volume (from 142.0+/-4.2 to 72.2+/-2.0 ml; P<0.01). In addition, the distance walked in a 6-min walk test increased markedly (P<0.01) from 260.3+/-5.2 m at baseline to 440.9+/-5.7 m after 1 year of treatment. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that metoprolol in conjunction with an ACE inhibitor, diuretics and digoxin in patients with CHF can lead to a reverse in LV remodelling potentially through its anti-apoptotic effects.", 
    "158": "Pravastatin, irbesartan and captopril are frequently used in the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes. These drugs also exert beneficial metabolic effects, causing an improved glucose tolerance in patients, but the precise mechanisms by which this is achieved remain elusive. To this end, we have studied whether these drugs influence insulin secretion in vivo through effects on islet blood perfusion. Captopril (3 mg/kg of body weight), irbesartan (3 mg/kg of body weight) and pravastatin (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) were injected intravenously into anaesthetized female Wistar rats. Blood flow rates were determined by a microsphere technique. Blood glucose concentrations were measured with test reagent strips and serum insulin concentrations were measured by ELISA. Pancreatic blood flow was markedly increased by pravastatin (P<0.001), captopril (P<0.05) and irbesartan (P<0.01). Pancreatic islet blood flow was significantly and preferentially enhanced after the administration of captopril (P<0.01), irbesartan (P<0.01) and pravastatin (P<0.001). Kidney blood flow was enhanced significantly by pravastatin (P<0.01), irbesartan (P<0.05) and captopril (P<0.01). Captopril and pravastatin also enhanced late-phase insulin secretion and positively influenced glycaemia in intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests. In conclusion, the present study suggests that a local pancreatic renin-angiotensin system and pravastatin treatment may be selectively controlling pancreatic islet blood flow, augmenting insulin secretion and thereby improving glucose tolerance. Our findings indicate significant gender-related differences in the vascular response to these agents. Since statins and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are frequently used by diabetic patients, the antidiabetic actions of these drugs reported previously might occur, in part, through the beneficial direct islet effects shown in the present study.", 
    "159": "Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events, but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests. The ACTIVE-W (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. Idraparinux, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling. Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion. Finally, percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high-risk patients.",

Recent studies have shown candesartan to be an effective therapy for heart failure patients, producing a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that candesartan is effective in heart failure patients who are intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in patients already receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and for heart failure patients with preserved systolic function. The primary end point in the latter group failed to achieve statistical significance due to the small number of events. This paper will review the data supporting the use of candesartan to treat all heart failure patients, regardless of their ejection fraction.",

Comparative therapeutic trials have shown that it is as effective as other dihydropyridines, in particular amlodipine, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Lercanidipine is well tolerated, with most treatment-emergent events related to vasodilation. Lercanidipine produces less reflex tachycardia and peripheral oedema. Common adverse events included headache and flushing. Because of its efficacy and favorable safety profile, lercanidipine has the potential to improve blood pressure control in a wide range of patients, including those who have not responded to, or who have been unable to tolerate other antihypertensive agents.",

    "166": "The decision to offer patients with myocardial ischemia a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery has been largely determined by extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular function, since the early 1970's. Based upon subset analyses, and long-term follow-up, of three moderate-sized trials of stable patients and two small trials of unstable angina (excluding recent myocardial infarction, MI) patients, the notion has persisted that patients with left main narrowing >50% or three-vessel stenoses >70%, or even two-vessel stenoses >70%, where one of the vessels is the proximal left anterior descending, derive a \"survival benefit\" relative to medical therapy (MED), from CABG (anatomic paradigm). The MED of the original CABG versus MED trials consisted of little more than anti-anginal medications, used on an as-needed basis. In the ensuing 3 decades, multiple large, well done, randomized clinical trials have established a survival benefit for 4 different forms of MED among a broad spectrum of CAD patients. Aspirin; lipid lowering, especially with statins; b-blockers; and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blocking agents; have all been shown to enhance survival, as well as reduce other objective adverse outcomes of CAD. The advances in MED, coupled with the small but significant mortality and morbidities of both CABG and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), are among the reasons to skeptically consider potential \"survival benefit\" of revascularization. A more common and far more easily justified reason to consider revascularization is to relieve \"medically refractory\" myocardial ischemia, particularly when the ischemia is accompanied by symptoms. Accordingly, documentation of medically refractory myocardial ischemia provides the answer to the first question of myocardial revascularization, \"Is this patient likely to derive clinical benefit from revascularization, at this time?\" It is only after this question has been answered that one needs to consider the relative advantages and disadvantages of PCI versus CABG (physiologic paradigm). Two of the relative advantages of PCI, namely speed of reperfusion, and relatively low morbidity, are among the reasons that most randomized trial data, and most clinical application of revascularization to patients with MI (ST-elevation MI [STEMI], and non-STEMI) have been by PCI. In contrast, for stable patients with medically refractory ischemia, anatomic considerations continue to be relevant to the choice between CABG and PCI. Specific advantages of CABG include: its potential to revascularize chronically occluded vessels with collaterals supplying viable myocardium; the fact that conduits protect territories rather than simply treating lesions; and the greater durability of conduits compared to bare-metal stents (drug-eluting stents may change the picture). Based on these principles, physiologic, rather than anatomic, considerations are most useful in determining whether to revascularize, and how urgently to revascularize (STEMI is an emergent indication and high-risk non-STEMI an urgent indication). Coronary anatomy, including both number of vessels and lesion characteristics, continues to help decide between CABG and PCI, and in formulating patient specific strategies.",

    "168": "Prolonged sevoflurane anesthesia with fresh gas flow less than 1 l min is unlikely to lead to clinically significant renal injury. When used as maintenance agents for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, sevoflurane anesthesia at a fresh gas flow of 3 l min, isoflurane and propofol are associated with similar rates of postoperative renal dysfunction. Less compound A is produced with smaller soda lime containers. High flow sevoflurane anesthesia (fresh gas flow of 4-6 l min) in combination with perioperative ketorolac is unlikely to lead to renal injury. Chronic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is associated with an increased incidence of postoperative renal impairment in patients undergoing elective aortic surgery. Thoracic epidural anesthesia and postoperative analgesia are associated with a decreased incidence of renal failure in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Compared with open surgical repair, endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm is associated with less renal injury.",

    "173": "Kinins are synthesized from their precursors by different enzymes and participate in the regulation of cardiovascular function through bradykinin (BK) B1 and B2 receptors. They modulate blood coagulation by exerting antithrombotic and profibrinolytic actions. By activating B2 receptors that results in the release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, kinins inhibit vascular smooth muscle growth and neointima formation, which may play an inhibitory role on the atherosclerosis development, while through the activation of B1 receptors, they may play a deleterious role in this disease. Kinins are potent endogenous vasodilators that are involved in the regulation of coronary vascular tone. However, due to their metabolic characteristics, these peptides act mainly as an autocrine/paracrine factor to locally regulate blood perfusion of organs. By modulating cellular energy metabolism and myocardial oxygen consumption, they protect cardiac and vascular endothelial function in myocardial ischemia and heart failure. Finally, mounting evidence indicates that kinins are involved in the actions of some drugs actually used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists. Taken together, the kinin system constitutes a potential therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases. Experiments in animals attempted to explore the kinin system as a therapeutic means, including the mobilization of endogenous kinins using pharmacological agents, searching BK analogs with long-acting properties and gene therapies. However, the potential values of the kinin system have not been taken into consideration in clinical practice for cardiovascular indications.", 
    "174": "There is significant evidence that both angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and type 1 and type 2 angiotensin 2 (A2) receptor blockers may inhibit tumor growth. The finding is supported by many reports where these two classes of drugs showed cytostatic effects on the cultures of several lines of both normal and neoplastic cells. These drugs often transformed the cellular biochemical structures, especially in neoplastic cell lines. The same drugs also delayed the growth of different types of tumors in a variety of experimental animals (breast and lung carcinoma in mice; sarcomas, squamous cell carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas in rats), and there are a few reports of successful treatment of a limited number of cases of Kaposi sarcoma and gliomas with these drugs. Retrospective studies in hypertensive subjects treated with ACEI or A2 receptor blockers also seem to indicate that the incidence and growth of different neoplasms was delayed when these patients were compared to hypertensive patients receiving alternate medications. There is strong indication that the pharmacologic effect of these drugs may be exerted by reduction or inhibition of the synthesis of angiotensin 2. A2 is a powerful mitogen and its effect on cellular growth is exerted through stimulation of many factors, including transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), epidermal growth factor (EGF), smooth muscle actin (SMA), and tyrosine kinase. A2 also regulates apoptotic mechanisms and angiogenesis. The pharmacologic action of most of these drugs, however, is not necessarily limited to downregulaton of A2. Many ACEI, especially those containing the sulfhydryl (SH group), possess antioxidant or metalloprotease inhibitory properties per se. These experimental and retrospective data justify clinical testing of these drugs in appropriate randomized trials. Several such trials are currently in process. If these trials confirm the experimental and retrospective studies, these agents will provide a significant contribution to the therapeutic treatment of many malignancies in humans.",

First dipstick test identified 594 individuals positive for albuminuria. Repeat dipstick could be done in only 576, of whom 212 showed persistent albuminuria. Significant proteinuria was detected in 24 individuals of the 208 who had 24 h urine protein measured. Of these 24 patients, 3 were found to have chronic renal failure, 12 were presumed to have diabetic nephropathy clinically, one each had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and biopsy proven diabetic nephropathy, and 7 patients had proteinuria of unknown aetiology.",

The patients were treated with temocapril (1 mg; n = 14), losartan (12.5 mg; n = 16), or a combination therapy (n = 13) for 12 months. We prospectively evaluated blood pressure (BP), urinary protein excretion (UPE), biochemical parameters and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system before and after 12 months of treatment.", 
    "181": "Although the overall plasma aldosterone concentrations values did not change after any of the treatments administered for 12 months, they eventually increased in 23 (temocapril, seven patients; losartan, eight patients; combination, seven patients) of the 43 patients (53.4%; aldosterone breakthrough), and fell in the remainder (46.6%). Blood pressure and renal function did not differ among the three groups at 12 months. In contrast, UPE was significantly higher in patients with, than without aldosterone breakthrough during temocapril and losartan administration. However, combination therapy induced a more remarkable reduction in UPE regardless of aldosterone breakthrough.",

    "183": "Cardiovascular secondary prevention plays a fundamental role due to the rising average age of the population. The reorganization of the health care system is also becoming more important. Especially the needs of high-risk patients have to be prioritized. A change of habits (e. g. abnegation of nicotine, change in eating habits, obtaining a BMI<25) is the basis of preventive measures in order to maximize the effectivity of drug therapy. Here the application of statins takes center stage (if there are no contraindications) which minimizes the risk of coronary incidences by 30%. In case of high lipid blood level, fibrates have to be applied at a low level of HDL-cholesterol and omega-3 fatty acids at high values of triglycerides. Omega-3 fatty acids must be given in the form of 1 g ethyl esters of EPA and DHA, otherwise a significant reduction of fatal cardiovascular incidences cannot be proven. Recently ACE inhibitors have gained in importance because of their ability to reduce the formation of plaques. Furthermore beta-blockers and aspirin can be applied for therapeutic measures, whereas different periods of treatment are recommended by the guidelines. With the aid of algorithms it is possible to specify the risk of experiencing a second myocardial infarction.", 
    "184": "The major long-term benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have now clearly been demonstrated in patients with arterial hypertension, cardiac insufficiency, coronary artery disease and several renal diseases. Such long-term treatment markedly alters the cardiovascular response to anaesthesia and surgery, whereas preliminary data suggest that short-term renin angiotensin system blockade might provide perioperative organ protection and improved circulatory conditions. Besides the classic view that the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II is mainly due to ACE, alternative pathways have recently been identified, including cathepsin G as well as chymostatin- and aprotinin-sensitive serine proteases that are released from mastocytes and endothelial cells and which are insensitive to the effects of ACE inhibitors. These proteases are thought to contribute to tissue perfusion under hypoxic conditions and to structural remodelling. In clinical practice, ACE inhibitors may be preferred to angiotensin II receptor antagonists since the former, besides reducing angiotensin II synthesis, also lead to an accumulation of kinins (e.g. bradykinin), which have important cardio- and renal protective effects through liberation of prostacyclin and nitric oxide in endothelial cells and through stimulation of guanylate cyclase to form cyclic GMP.",

The rate of compliance with guidelines in 50 control patients was measured at discharge. A multidisciplinary team including cardiac surgeons, nurses, dieticians, physical therapists, and clinical pharmacists evaluated the guideline compliance in the control group and developed interventions to assure guideline compliance at the time of discharge. A subsequent study group of 50 patients was then assessed prospectively to measure the guideline compliance after institution of intervention programs. The multidisciplinary team agreed on predefined acceptable compliance limits as follows: (1) >80% of patients receive ACE inhibitors at discharge, (2) 100% of patients receive beta-blockers, aspirin, and lipid-lowering agents at discharge, and (3) 100% of patients receive lifestyle modification counseling at discharge.

The present study examined the influence of the ACEi, perindopril, on cognitive performance and anxiety measures in rats. Two groups of rats were treated orally for one week with the ACEi, perindopril, at doses of 0.1 and 1.0mg/kg/day. Learning was assessed by the reference memory task in the water maze, comparing treated to control rats. Over five training days both perindopril-treated groups learnt the location of the submerged platform in the water maze task significantly faster than control rats. A 60s probe trial on day 6 showed that the 1.0mg/kg/day group spent significantly longer time in the training quadrant than control rats. This improved performance in the swim maze task was not due to the effect of perindopril on motor activity or the anxiety levels of the rats as perindopril-treated and control animals behaved similarly in activity boxes and on the elevated+maze. These results confirm the anecdotal human studies that ACEis have a positive influence on cognition and provide possibilities for ACEis to be developed into therapies for memory loss.",

The development and progression of calcific aortic valve disease are based on an active process that shares a number of similarities with atherosclerosis.

    "192": "Stable angina is an age-related condition that typically affects men at an earlier age than women, adversely affects quality of life, and increases mortality. Stable angina is the result of an increase in myocardial oxygen demand in the setting of coronary arteries chronically narrowed by large, stable atherosclerotic plaques and a diminished myocardial oxygen supply. The characteristics of the chest pain or discomfort contribute to the clinical presentation. Treatment guidelines call for efforts to modify CHD risk, antianginal drug therapy, and patient education. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel may be used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and death. A beta-blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be used as initial antianginal drug therapy, and a long-acting nitrate or dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be added. The choice among antianginal drug therapies often hinges on patient characteristics, contraindications, and adverse effects. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery is an option for ischemia refractory to maximum tolerated dosages of antianginal therapy.", 
    "193": "Various drug therapies may be used to manage stable angina, with coronary revascularization as an option in patients who are refractory to drug therapy. However, antianginal drug therapies may prove inadequate for managing anginal episodes for a variety of reasons, and revascularization is not always effective.", 
    "194": "Increased blood pressure (BP) in genetic hypertension is usually caused by high activity of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) which is enhanced by central angiotensin II but lowered by central nitric oxide (NO). We have therefore evaluated NO synthase (NOS) activity as well as neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) protein expression in brainstem and midbrain of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) characterized by enhanced sympathetic vasoconstriction. We also studied possible participation of brain NO in antihypertensive effects of chronic captopril treatment of adult SHR. NOS activity was increased in midbrain of SHR compared to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. This could be ascribed to enhanced iNOS expression, whereas nNOS expression was unchanged and eNOS expression was reduced in this brain region. In contrast, no significant changes of NOS activity were found in brainstem of SHR in which nNOS and iNOS expression was unchanged, but eNOS expression was increased. Chronic captopril administration lowered BP of adult SHR mainly by attenuation of sympathetic tone, whereas the reduction of angiotensin II-dependent vasoconstriction and the decrease of residual BP (amelioration of structural remodeling of resistance vessels) were less important. This treatment did not affect significantly either NOS activity or expression of any NOS isoform in the two brain regions. Our data do not support the hypothesis that altered brain NO formation contributes to sympathetic hyperactivity and high BP of adult SHR with established hypertension.", 
    "195": "Systemic hypertension is a common disorder in clinical practice and causes significant morbidity and premature death. A small percentage (< 5%) of patients with hypertension may have renovascular hypertension. Strictly speaking, the term renovascular hypertension should be applied only when the blood pressure rises as a consequence of renal ischemia. Thus, the mere presence of renal artery stenosis is not synonymous with renovascular hypertension. Treatment strategies should be directed at ''renovascular hypertension'' rather than an anatomic renal artery stenosis (which may be discovered accidentally). Management of renal artery stenosis/renovascular hypertension is imprecise at best. This article discusses the patho-physiology of renovascular hypertension and how to approach a patient with renal artery stenosis.",

The imbalance of serum potassium is important because it can lead to life-threatening events. Potassium balance may be lost both through the neurohormonal mechanisms involved in cardiovascular diseases and through the drugs used in the treatment of this illness. Avoiding both hypo- and hyperkalemia is beneficial in several cardiovascular diseases, especially heart failure. Electrolyte abnormalities are frequently seen complications in subjects with heart failure. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are particularly feared complications in K+ instability.", 
    "197": "We describe two newborn infants with aortic arch obstructive malformations who became anuric after initiation of captopril. Since angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can alter renal blood flow by reduction in angiotensin II and blocking autoregulation phenomenon, it is important to use them with great caution in neonates with aortic arch obstructive malformations, while monitoring their renal function closely.", 
    "198": "Recently, it was shown that myocardial infarction aggravates preexistent mild renal damage that is elicited by unilateral nephrectomy in rats. The mechanism behind this cardiorenal interaction likely involves the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and/or vasoactive peptides that are metabolized by neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The renoprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) as well as combined ACE/NEP inhibition with a vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI) was investigated in the same model to clarify the underlying mechanism. At week 17 after sequential induction of unilateral nephrectomy and myocardial infarction, treatment with lisinopril (ACEi), AVE7688 (VPI), or vehicle was initiated for 6 wk. Proteinuria and systolic BP (SBP) were evaluated weekly. Renal damage was assessed primarily by proteinuria, interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) staining, and the incidence of focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS). At start of treatment, proteinuria had increased progressively to 167 +/- 20 mg/d in the entire cohort (n = 42). Both ACEi and VPI provided a similar reduction in proteinuria, alpha-SMA, and FGS compared with vehicle at week 23 (proteinuria 76 +/- 6 versus 77 +/- 4%; alpha-SMA 60 +/- 6 versus 77 +/- 3%; FGS 52 +/- 14 versus 61 +/- 10%). Similar reductions in systolic BP were observed in both ACEi- and VPI-treated groups (33 +/- 3 and 37 +/- 2%, respectively). Compared with ACEi, VPI-treated rats displayed a significantly larger reduction of plasma (41 +/- 5 versus 61 +/- 4%) and renal (53 +/- 6 versus 74 +/- 4%) ACE activity. It is concluded that both ACEi and VPI intervention prevent renal damage in a rat model of cardiorenal interaction. VPI treatment seemed to provide no additional renoprotection compared with sole ACEi after 6 wk of treatment in this model, despite a more pronounced ACE-inhibiting effect of VPI.",

Treatment consisted of chemotherapy followed by a partial pancreaticoduodenectomy. Due to ischemia, resection of the small intestines was performed the same day. After admission, a transesophageal echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 40%. Because enteral administration of drugs was impossible, intravenous enalaprilat 2 mg once a day for 1 day followed by sublingual captopril 25 mg twice a day were started. Blood samples were taken before and after administration. After 1 day of sublingual captopril treatment the angiotensin II level decreased with more than 50%, comparable to the decrease seen after intravenous administration of enalaprilat. Sublingual captopril has been used in the treatment of hypertensive crisis and heart failure. Although frequently reported, no study has investigated the effect on angiotensin II levels after sublingual administration in heart failure patients. This case-report demonstrated that sublingual administration of 25 mg captopril twice a day yielded a considerable decrease in angiotensin II plasma levels which was comparable to the effect seen after an intravenous administration of 2 mg enalaprilat.", 
    "208": "Evolvement and progression of cardiovascular diseases affecting the venous and arterial system are influenced by a multitude of environmental and hereditary factors. Many of these hereditary factors consist of defined gene polymorphisms, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or insertion-deletion polymorphisms, which directly or indirectly affect the hemostatic system. The frequencies of individual hemostatic gene polymorphisms in different normal populations are well defined. However, descriptions of patterns of genetic variability of a larger extent of different factors of hereditary hypercoagulability in single populations are scarce. The aim of this study was i) to give a detailed description of the frequencies of factors of hereditary thrombophilia and their combinations in a German population (n = 282) and ii) to compare their distributions with those reported for other regions. Variants of coagulation factors [factor V 1691G>A (factor V Leiden), factor V 4070A>G (factor V HR2 haplotype), factor VII Arg353Gln, factor XIII Val34Leu, beta-fibrinogen -455G>A, prothrombin 20210G>A], coagulation inhibitors [tissue factor pathway inhibitor 536C>T, thrombomodulin 127G>A], fibrinolytic factors [angiotensin converting enzyme intron 16 insertion/deletion, factor VII-activating protease 1601G>A (FSAP Marburg I), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-675 insertion/deletion (5G/4G), tissue plasminogen activator intron h deletion/insertion], and other factors implicated in influencing susceptibility to thromboembolic diseases [apolipoprotein E2/E3/E4, glycoprotein Ia 807C>T, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677C>T] were included. The distribution of glycoprotein Ia 807C>T deviated significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and a comparison with previously published data indicates marked region and ethnicity dependent differences in the genotype distributions of some other factors.", 
    "209": "Although the association of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) with a negatively charged membrane is thought to be responsible for hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) during hemodialysis, we hypothesize that these complications are due to changes in plasma aminopeptidase P (APP) activity and genotype. To test this hypothesis, we measured plasma APP activity in 14 patients who suffered HSR (HSR+) while dialyzed with an AN69 membrane and simultaneously treated with an ACEi. APP activity was also studied in a control group (n=39) dialyzed under the same conditions, but who did not suffer any side effect (HSR-). We found significantly decreased plasma APP activity (P=0.013) in HSR+ subjects as well as altered degradation of endogenous des-Arginine(9)-bradykinin, with a significantly lower beta value (P<0.001). The same analytical approach was taken in 171 relatives of HSR+ patients. Variance component analysis suggested that genetic differences may explain 61% of the phenotypic variability of plasma APP activity (P<0.001) and the kinetic parameters that characterized kinin degradation. We also showed that the C-2399A single-nucleotide polymorphism at the XPNPEP2 locus was a significant predictor of APP activity in the 39 HSR- controls (P=0.029). Furthermore, a recessive genetic model for the A allele disclosed a significant difference in mean APP activity by genotype (P<0.001). Finally, our study defined the nonspecific inhibition of recombinant APP by some ACEis. In conclusion, this paper highlights the complexity of HSR in hemodialysis, suggesting, as with angioedema, that these rare, but life-threatening adverse events are governed by several metabolic and genetic factors.",

    "215": "An increase in bradykinin has been suggested to contribute to the enhanced insulin sensitivity observed in the presence of ACE inhibitors. To investigate a potential direct, nonvascular effect on an insulin target tissue, the effect of bradykinin on glucose uptake and insulin signaling was studied in primary rat adipocytes. Whereas basal glucose uptake was not altered, bradykinin augmented insulin-stimulated glucose uptake twofold, which was blocked by HOE-140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. The bradykinin effect on glucose uptake was nitric oxide (NO) dependent, mimicked by NO donors and absent in adipocytes from endothelial NO synthase-/- mice. Investigation of insulin signaling revealed that bradykinin enhanced insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) Tyr phosphorylation, Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation, and GLUT4 translocation. In contrast, insulin-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 and Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation were decreased in the presence of bradykinin, accompanied by decreased IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation. Furthermore, bradykinin did not enhance insulin action in the presence of the JNK inhibitor, SP-600125, or in adipocytes from JNK1-/- mice. These data indicate that bradykinin enhances insulin sensitivity in adipocytes via an NO-dependent pathway that acts by modulating the feedback inhibition of insulin signaling at the level of IRS-1.",

The studies of ACE inhibitors have found conflicting results in their ability to improve digit blood flow and reduce both frequency and severity of RP attacks. Two studies have focused on the use of losartan for RP treatment, with both finding a statistically significant reduction in attacks and one showing improvement in symptoms of RP in comparison with the commonly utilized calcium-channel blocker, nifedipine. Most of the studies were short term (< or =12 wk) and included a limited number of patients (<60).", 
    "224": "ACE inhibitors and ARBs may provide some minor benefits in the relief of RP, although no definite evidence exists to suggest that they are superior to traditionally used treatments such as calcium-channel blockers.

    "225": "Anaemia and hypertension are common in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. The correction of anaemia with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) can improve survival and decrease the decline of renal function. Angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (AIIRA) can also slow the progression of renal failure, but the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system can worsen anaemia. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of antihypertensive therapy (ACEI plus AIIRA) in the requirements of darbepoietin in a group of elderly predialysis patients. We included 71 patients (m = 39, f = 32), mean age of 76.3 years with a mean creatinine clearance of 17.5 ml/min. Patients were divided in two groups according to their antihypertensive therapy: G-I patients under ACEI or AIIRA therapy and G-II normotensive patients or hypertensive patients under antihypertensive drugs other than ACEI or AIIRA. The groups were compared regarding demographic, nutritional, biochemical and inflammatory parameters. We also compared the mean darbepoietin dose. In GI the mean dose of darbepoietin was higher than in GII (0.543 vs. 0.325 microg/kg/week, P = 0.032). We did not find any difference regarding other parameters analysed. We conclude that ACEI and AIIRA can increase the needs of darbepoietin in predialysis elderly patients. However, when formally indicated to treat hypertension in a specific patient, they should not be switched to another antihypertensive agent. Instead, in such cases, higher doses of ESA should be used, if necessary.", 
    "226": "Urinary albumin excretion is a predictor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. We investigated which parameters determine baseline urinary albumin excretion in nondiabetic subjects, without renal disease. In addition, we evaluated the parameters that predict the albuminuria-lowering efficacy of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In this substudy of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular Endstage Disease Intervention Trial, 384 microalbuminuric patients were included. Patient and biochemical characteristics were obtained at baseline and after 3 months of double-blinded, randomized treatment (fosinopril 20 mg or placebo). Mean age was 51.1+/-11.5 years, and 65.6% were male. Median urinary albumin excretion was 22.2 mg per 24 hours. At baseline, mean arterial pressure (beta(standardized)=0.161; P=0.006), urinary sodium excretion (beta(standardized)=0.154; P=0.011), and estimated renal function were independently associated with albumin excretion. In these predominantly normotensive to prehypertensive subjects, fosinopril reduced albumin excretion by 18.5% versus a 6.1% increase on placebo after 3 months (P<0.001). Fosinopril use and blood pressure reduction independently predicted the change in urinary albumin excretion. Baseline urinary albumin excretion independently predicted the antialbuminuric effect of fosinopril (beta(standardized)=-0.303; P<0.001). In conclusion, at baseline, sodium intake and blood pressure were positively associated with urinary albumin excretion. Fosinopril reduced albuminuria more than might be expected from its blood pressure-lowering effect alone, and this effect was more outspoken in subjects with higher baseline albumin excretion. Based on our data, we hypothesize that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may result in superior cardiovascular protection when compared with other blood pressure-lowering agents in subjects with higher baseline levels of albuminuria.", 
    "227": "The renin-angiotensin system is a key regulator of blood pressure (BP), with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) used clinically to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. ACE2 is a newly identified member of this system, which converts angiotensin II to angiotensin, and of which the occurrence in plasma has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the heritability of circulating ACE, ACE2, and neprilysin (NEP), which may also be a regulator of BP, in a family study, and to determine covariates that contribute to the variation in plasma activity. ACE, ACE2, and NEP activities were measured in plasma from 534 subjects in the Leeds Family Study using selective fluorogenic substrates. Genetic factors accounted for 24.5%, 67%, and 22.7% of the phenotypic variation in circulating ACE, ACE2, and NEP, respectively. ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism and other measured covariates accounted for 23.8% of variance in circulating ACE. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was a significant determinant of circulating ACE2. Measured covariates accounted for 17.3% of variation in circulating NEP. ACE and NEP were associated with systolic and diastolic BP in univariate analyses; however, only ACE was independently associated with systolic and diastolic BP after accounting for covariates and shared childhood household.", 
    "228": "The presence of edema in different phases and stages of essential hypertension may be due to antihypertensive treatment. Some drugs may cause edema by inducing vasodilatation, increasing the capillary exchange surface and capillary filtration. Pycnogenol has an important anti-edema effect in diabetic microangiopathy and chronic venous insufficiency. This 8-week study evaluated capillary filtration in 2 comparable treatment groups with hypertension treated with a calcium antagonist (nifedipine) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to define its efficacy in preventing edema caused by antihypertensives. A significant decrease in filtration was observed in the Pycnogenol groups. Pycnogenol controls this type of edema, it helps to prevent and limit long-term damage in the microcirculation in hypertensive patients, and allows the dose of anti-hypertensive drugs to be reduced in most patients.",

New-onset AHF (de novo AHF) was diagnosed in 37%, of which 42% was due to acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Clinical classification according to the guidelines divided AHF patients into (i) decompensated HF (65%), (ii) pulmonary oedema (16%), (iii) HF and hypertension (11%), (iv) cardiogenic shock (4%), and (v) right HF (3%). Coronary heart disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation were the most common underlying conditions. Arrhythmias, valvular dysfunction, and ACS were each present as precipitating factor in one-third of cases. Preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (> or =45%) was observed in 34%. Valvular disorders were common, especially mitral regurgitation (MR) which was reported on echocardiography in 80% of patients. Median length of stay was 9 days, and in-hospital mortality 6.7%.

Despite treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and captopril he required hospitalization twice during his first 2 months of life for congestive heart failure (CHF). The VSD was closed at three and one-half months of age without resection of the diverticulum and CHF symptoms resolved. At 26 months of age he is doing well despite the residual RV diverticulum.

In assessing drug reactions, a detailed clinical history and careful documentation of reactions are most important. Elucidating the nature and time course (first versus subsequent exposure, immediate versus non-immediate) of a reaction can help to distinguish immune from non-immune hypersensitivity, as well as IgE-mediated from T cell-mediated allergy. Skin testing and in-vitro tests are of predictive value for only a limited group of IgE-mediated drug allergic reactions. Drug provocation challenges can be used to eliminate suspicion of a low-probability drug reaction, find a safe alternative to a proven or probable drug reaction, or as a means of desensitisation. If a patient taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor develops angioedema, the cause must be assumed to be the ACE inhibitor until proven otherwise.",

The increased expression of Gialpha and blood pressure was restored toward WKY levels by captopril treatment, suggesting a role for angiotensin (Ang) II in the enhanced expression of Gialpha protein and blood pressure. This study was undertaken to investigate whether 1 kidney 1 clip (1K-1C) hypertensive rats that exhibit enhanced levels of Ang II also express enhanced levels of Gialpha proteins. Aortas from 1K-1C hypertensive rats were used. The expression of G-proteins was determined at protein levels with immunoblotting techniques, using specific antibodies for different isoforms of G-proteins. The levels of Gialpha-2 and Gialpha-3 proteins were significantly higher in aortas from 1K-1C hypertensive rats than in control rats; Gsalpha levels were unchanged. The inhibitory effect of low concentrations of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTPgammaS) on forskolin (FSK)-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity was significantly enhanced in aortas from 1K-1C hypertensive rats; the inhibitory effect of C-ANP(4-23), which specifically interacts with the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-C receptor, and Ang II on AC was attenuated. GTPgammaS, isoproterenol, glucagon, NaF, and FSK stimulated the AC activity in aortas from control and hypertensive rats to varying degrees; however, the stimulations were significantly lower in hypertensive rats than in control rats. These data suggest that aortas from 1K-1C hypertensive rats exhibit enhanced expression of Gialpha proteins and associated functions.",

    "240": "Statins have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events and overall mortality in primary and secondary prevention trials. This study was designed to examine the effect of statin use on overall death. Cross-sectional data were obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Integrated Service Network 16 database for approximately 1.5 million veterans followed up in 10 hospitals in the southern United States. Statins were prescribed more often to elderly subjects with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, and using cardiovascular drugs (beta blockers, aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers). The predictors of death were, as expected, cancer, diabetes mellitus, the use of cardiac drugs, and age. Importantly, using statins showed a highly significant negative association with death (odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.69, p <0.0001), even after adjustment for all other variables. Overall, the mean age at death among statin users was 2 years older than among nonstatin users, despite statin users being at a higher risk of death. In conclusion, the results of this study have shown that using statins is a potent life-saving strategy. The benefit observed in this study is unique because almost 1/2 the patients were >or=70 years of age when statin therapy was initiated.",

This is particularly relevant because the standard of care, beta blockers combined with diuretics, may contribute to adverse metabolic risk. The INternational VErapamil SR-trandolapril STudy compared a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil SR) and a beta-blocker-based (atenolol) strategy with trandolapril and/or hydrochlorothiazide added to control blood pressure (BP) in patients with CAD. The 16,176 patients without DM at entry were investigated with regard to newly diagnosed DM during follow-up. Newly diagnosed DM was less frequent in the verapamil SR versus atenolol strategy (7.0% vs 8.2%, hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.95, p <0.01). Characteristics associated with risk for newly diagnosed DM included United States residence, left ventricular hypertrophy, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, Hispanic ethnicity, coronary revascularization, hypercholesterolemia, greater body mass index, and higher follow-up systolic BP. Addition of trandolapril to verapamil SR decreased DM risk and addition of hydrochlorothiazide to atenolol increased risk. In conclusion, clinical findings associated with more severe vascular disease and Hispanic ethnicity identify a group at high risk for developing DM, whereas lower on-treatment BP and treatment with verapamil SR-trandolapril attenuated this risk.",

All patients underwent coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsy and were clinically stable for at least 6 months before enrollment. The combined primary end point included mortality, urgent heart transplantation, and readmission to hospital due to heart failure progression. The secondary end point was to determine the severity of heart failure (serum level of N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide), cardiac function (LV ejection fraction by radionuclide ventriculography), LV diameters by echocardiography, exercise capacity (changes in NYHA class, changes in peak oxygen consumption), and changes in quality of life (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire).

Renal dysfunction, baseline serum potassium, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, New York Heart Association functional class, and treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor are factors associated with the development of hyperkalemia in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. More specifically, our results suggests that before initiating drugs that can cause hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure, a strong consideration should be given to calculate creatinine clearance and that patients with a creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min should undergo a close monitoring of their serum potassium to prevent the development of hyperkalemia.",

    "257": "Hypertension is one of the main risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension in childhood is defined as blood pressure > or = 95. percentile for healthy children population. The prevalence of hypertension in childhood is considerably lower than in adults and is about 1%. The aetiology of hypertension in childhood differs from adult population--in children secondary forms are more common than primary, however, in adolescents primary form already prevails. In general, the younger the child and the higher the blood pressure, the more probably it is a secondary form of hypertension. The most common causes of secondary hypertension are renal diseases (renoparenchymal or renovascular). Cardiac diseases (aortic isthmus stenosis), endocrinopathies, central nervous system disorders or use of hypertensinogenic drugs are less frequent causes of secondary hypertension. Each child with hypertension has to be carefully examined; the extent of the examination depends on the age of the child and severity of hypertension. The main task for the investigation is to exclude or reveal secondary form of hypertension, which could be causally treated (e.g. angioplasty in renal artery stenosis). Treatment of hypertension is non-pharmacological and pharmacological (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers).", 
    "258": "The aim of this study was to verify an approach for calculating pharmacokinetic parameters suitable for adjusting dosage regimens in patients with renal dysfunction. We carried out a retrospective analysis of the pharmacokinetic profiles of 12 new quinolone antibiotics and 11 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in patients with normal and impaired renal function to obtain the renal excretion ratio (R(renal)) of each drug. We demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of each drug in a patient with renal dysfunction can be adequately estimated using the R(renaI) value of each drug together with the creatinine clearance as an index of the individual's renal function. Using the R(renaI) value obtained, we could successfully simulate pharmacokinetic profiles of the drugs in publications other than that used to obtain the R(renal) values. On the other hand, age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics of new quinolone antibiotics are not always adequately predicted using the R(renal) value compared to using creatinine clearance alone as an index, and the reasons for this are not fully understood. These results demonstrate that dosage regimens of quinolone antibiotics and ACEIs in patients with renal dysfunction can be adequately optimized using the R(renal) value for each drug using the present approach.", 
    "259": "Renin is the rate-limiting enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system and thus dictates the level of the pressor hormone angiotensin-II. The classical site of renin expression and secretion is the renal juxtaglomerular cell, where its expression is tightly regulated by physiological cues. An evolutionarily conserved transcriptional enhancer located 11 kb upstream of the human RENIN gene has been reported to markedly enhance transcription in renin expressing cells in vitro. However, its importance in vivo remains unclear. We tested whether this enhancer is required for appropriate tissue- and cell-specific expression, or for physiological regulation of the human RENIN gene. To accomplish this, we used a retrofitting technique employing homologous recombination in bacteria to delete the enhancer from a 160-kb P1-artificial chromosome containing human RENIN, two upstream genes and one downstream gene, and then generated two lines of transgenic mice. We previously showed that human renin expression in transgenic mice containing the wild type construct is tightly regulated as is expression of the linked genes. Deletion of the enhancer had no effect on tissue-specific expression of human RENIN, but using the downstream gene as an internal control, found that human RENIN mRNA levels were 3-10-fold decreased compared with constructs containing the enhancer. Despite this decrease in expression, renin protein remained localized to renal juxtaglomerular cells and was appropriately regulated by cues that either increase or decrease expression of renin. Our results suggest that sequences other than the enhancer may be necessary for tissue-specific, cell-specific, and regulated expression of human RENIN.",

The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and, recently, the angiotensin receptor blockers (with their low adverse-effect profile) have added a new dimension to the drug treatment of hypertension. Just a decade after the introduction of angiotensin receptor blockers, physicians treating hypertension are now offered another exciting approach to achieving blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through the inhibition of renin.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether lisinopril treatment has any biochemical and/or histopathological effect on rat liver tissue in a L-NAME-induced hypertension model. Forty-eight 6-weeks-old male Spraque-Dawley rats were used in the study. The animals used in the study were randomly divided into four equal groups. To induce hypertension, L-NAME was added to drinking water at a concentration of 600 mg/l and each rat was given 75 mg/kg/day of L-NAME for 6 weeks. Tail cuff systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured at first, third, and sixth weeks. There was a significant difference between the experiment groups and controls. In only lisinopril given and L-NAME plus lisinopril administered groups, each rat was given 10 mg/kg of lisinopril for 6 weeks. At the end of the study, the animals were sacrificed. Blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical and histopathological analysis. It has been observed that mean NO level was significantly decreased in L-NAME given group (p<0.05). Mean ALT levels were significantly increased in lisinopril and L-NAME plus lisinopril given groups, when compared with the control group (p<0.05). AST levels were in normal range in all groups (p>0.05). Hepatocyte degeneration was prominent in lisinopril given group, whereas mononuclear cell infiltration was significant in L-NAME given groups. Although the beneficial effects in L-NAME-induced hypertension treatment, lisinopril can lead to some unexpected results like hepatocyte degeneration, serum enzyme level elevation, and slight mononuclear cell infiltration.",

However, non-pharmacological options have recently emerged as frequently used first-line tools for the treatment of various supraventricular and ventricular heart rhythm disturbances. Nevertheless, antiarrhythmic drug treatment is frequently used as a bridging or adjunctive therapy in conjunction with catheter ablation or implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Antiarrhythmic agents constitute a very heterogeneous group prone to various drug interactions and side-effects.

    "263": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are a family of host-derived enzymes involved in the turnover of extracellular matrix molecules. We have previously reported enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinases in Chlamydia muridarum urogenital tract infection of female mice. Kinetics and patterns of MMP expression as well as enhanced expression in susceptible strains of mice in the prior study implied a role for MMP in pathogenesis. To explore this further, we infected a susceptible strain of mice (C3H/HeN) with C. muridarum and treated two groups of mice with either one of two chemical inhibitors of MMP (MMPi; captopril and a chemically modified tetracycline) and reserved infected sham-treated mice as controls. Neither of the treatments affected shedding of viable chlamydiae from the lower urogenital tract, but the administration of either MMPi protected mice from the formation of hydrosalpinx-a surrogate marker of oviduct occlusion and infertility. Interestingly, the mechanism of protection for mice treated with chemically modified tetracycline 3, appeared to be related to prevention of ascending upper genital tract infection. These results imply that MMP are involved in pathogenesis of chlamydial infection in this model by mediating ascension of the infection into the upper genital tract.",

Patients who are receiving ACEIs are predisposed to developing angioedema which may be triggered by trauma, airway instrumentation, infection, and irritant fumes, particularly in those who are at increased risk. Cases of acute facial and airway oedema, due to ACEI drug administration, may be misdiagnosed as an anaphylactic reaction, and the association with ACEIs may be ignored. Some cases of intraoperative and postoperative airway edema may be precipitated by airway instrumentation in patients receiving ACEI drugs. The severity of airway compromise ranges from mild facial edema to severe laryngeal or subglottic edema which may prove life-threatening.",

    "268": "Yak milk casein derived from Qula, a traditional Tibetan acid curd cheese, was hydrolyzed by six commercially available proteases (Trypsin, Pepsin, Alcalase, Flavourzyme, Papain and Neutrase). These hydrolysates were assayed for their inhibitory activity of Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE). The hydrolysates obtained by Neutrase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity. The IC50 value of Neutrase-hydrolysate was 0.38 mg/ml. The hydrolysate obtained by Neutrase was further separated by consecutive ultra-filtration with 10 kDa and then with 6 kDa molecular weight cut-offs into different permeated parts and fractionated by gel filtration chromatography with a Sephadex G-25 column. The active fraction was subjected to RP-HPLC, in which five peaks were purified and identified. Amino acid sequence analysis confirmed that the peptides and origins were as follows: YQKFPQY (alphas2-CN; f89-95), LPQNIPPL (beta-CN; f70-77), SKVLPVPQK (beta-CN; f168-176), LPYPYY (kappa-CN; f56-61) and FLPYPYY (kappa-CN; f55-61). Their amino acid sequences matched well with those of known bioactive peptides from bovine casein. The results indicated that yak milk casein could be a resource to generate antihypertensive peptides and be used as multifunctional active ingredients for many value-added functional foods as well as a traditional food protein.", 
    "269": "Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and/or heart failure (HF) are frequent complications of hypertension and myocardial infarction (MI), placing affected patients at increased risk of significant morbidity and premature death. Given that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated and of pathophysiological importance in such patients, a strong therapeutic rationale exists to target the main effector mechanism (that is, angiotensin II [Ang II]) in order to lessen the associated morbidity and mortality burden. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and LV dysfunction and to slow disease progression in patients with HF, including high-risk, post-MI patients. However, ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) may not provide optimal long-term RAAS blockade (a finding that is associated with a worse prognosis) and many patients are unable to tolerate such therapy (because of troublesome dry cough, for example). In contrast, Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) may block the RAAS more completely than ACE-Is and appear to be better tolerated. Several large-scale trials gave evaluated the efficacy of ARBs in patients with LV dysfunction and/or HF (including high-risk, post-MI patients), and have confirmed their utility as an efficacious and well-tolerated alternative to ACE-Is in this setting.", 
    "270": "Glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy occur with end-stage kidney failure, irrespective of the primary etiology. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a key factor in these alterations either directly, by stimulating synthesis of extracellular matrix components and reducing collagenase production, or indirectly through other profibrogenic factors such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). TGF-beta is important for the proliferation of intrarenal fibroblasts and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition through which tubular cells become fibroblasts. Although several factors induce TGF-beta expression in the kidney, one very interesting aspect is the link between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (Aldo) system (RAAS) and TGF-beta. Angiotensin II (ANG II) stimulates TGF-beta expression in the kidney by various mechanisms and upregulates receptors for TGF-beta. ANG II can directly phosphorylate Smads without inducing TGF-beta. Recent data provide compelling evidence that other components of the RAAS including ANG III, renin, and Aldo also activate the TGF-beta system. As direct modulation of the TGF-beta system is not yet feasible in humans, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 (AT1)-receptor blockers are currently the most potential drugs to interfere with this ANG II-mediated TGF-beta expression. This review highlights some current aspects of the interaction between the RAAS and the TGF-beta axis.",

Enalapril produced significant morphological alterations only in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. The volumes of this area and the corresponding endocrine cells were lower than in the control. Enalapril produced a delayed modifying effect on the structure of the adrenal zona glomerulosa by moderating hyperplasic alterations, which are characteristic of intact mature NISAG rats.",

    "273": "Monitoring national patterns of antihypertensive drug therapy is essential to assessing adherence to treatment guidelines and the impact of major scientific publications on physician prescribing. We analyzed data from 2 US National Ambulatory Care Surveys to examine trends between 1993 and 2004 in the prescription of antihypertensive drug classes for uncomplicated hypertension and the association between thiazide and beta-blocker prescribing and physician and patient characteristics. Diuretic prescriptions remained level through 2001 (39%; 95% CI: 34% to 44%) but increased to 53% (48% to 58%) in 2003, largely because of a 72% increase in thiazide prescriptions in the first quarter of 2003 (50%; 95% CI: 40% to 59%). However, these increases did not sustain in 2004. Beta-blocker prescriptions increased modestly from 1993 (24%; 95% CI: 19% to 29%) to 2004 (33%; 95% CI: 28% to 39%). Prescription of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors declined significantly following the sixth Joint National Committee report, but both subsequently rebounded to prereport levels. Prescription of angiotensin II receptor blockers increased continuously from 1% in 1995 to 23% by 2004. Polytherapy prescriptions, particularly those involving > or = 3 drug classes, became increasingly prevalent, accounting for 60% of antihypertensive drug visits by 2004. Prescriptions of thiazides and beta-blockers were both more likely in 1998-2004 (versus 1993-1997). Blacks, women, and hospital outpatients were more likely to receive thiazides. Also, cardiologists were more likely to prescribe beta-blockers. Evidence-based guidelines for antihypertensive drug therapy do impact physician prescribing, but the impact seems to be short lived. Future interventions are imperative for promoting long-term adherence to published guidelines.", 
    "274": "It has been suggested that the effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers are in part because of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) signaling. Interactions between the AT2R and kinins modulate cardiovascular function. Because AT2R expression increases after vascular injury, we hypothesized that the effects on vascular remodeling of the AT1R blocker valsartan and the ACE inhibitor benazepril require AT2R signaling through the bradykinin 1 and 2 receptors (B1R and B2R). To test this hypothesis, Brown Norway rats were assigned to 8 treatments (n=16): valsartan, valsartan+PD123319 (AT2R inhibitor), valsartan+des-arg9-[Leu8]-bradykinin (B1R inhibitor), valsartan+HOE140 (B2R inhibitor), benazepril, benazepril+HOE140, amlodipine, and vehicle. After 1 week of treatment, carotid balloon injury was performed. Two weeks later, carotids were harvested for morphometry and analysis of receptor expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Valsartan and benazepril significantly reduced the intima:media ratio compared with vehicle. Blockade of AT2R, B1R, or B2R in the presence of valsartan prevented the reduction seen with valsartan alone. B2R blockade inhibited the effect of benazepril. Injury increased AT1R, AT2R, B1R, and B2R expression. Treatment with valsartan but not benazepril significantly increased intima AT2R expression 2-fold compared with vehicle, which was not reversed by inhibition of AT2R, B1R, and B2R. Functionally, valsartan increased intimal cGMP levels compared with vehicle, and this increase was inhibited by blocking the AT2R, B1R, and B2R. Results suggest that AT2R expression and increased cGMP represent a molecular mechanism that differentiates AT1R blockers, such as valsartan, from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors like benazepril.", 
    "275": "There is growing evidence to suggest a role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Experimental animal data suggest RAS-dependent mechanisms for the development of a structural and electrophysiologic substrate for AF. This is consistent with clinical data demonstrating the effectiveness of RAS blockade in preventing new-onset or recurrent AF in a variety of patient populations including patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, and those undergoing electrical cardioversion for AF. This review summarizes experimental and clinical evidence to date relating to the role of RAS in the pathogenesis of AF, and the efficacy of its inhibition in managing this common arrhythmia.", 
    "276": "This review summarises the recent epidemiological data on hypertension, the aims of the treatment of hypertension, and emphasizes the importance of the modification of target organ damages and accelerated clinical conditions. Because the pathogenesis of hypertension is extremely complex, the therapy most likely requires a combined drug administration. The modern third generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, not only has a favourable antihypertensive and anti-ischemic effect, but anti-atherosclerosis properties as well. There are plenty of evidence which demonstrate that lisinopril, a first line antihypertensive agent, has a positive effect in the treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy and nephropathy, and also has a favourable outcome after myocardial infarction and in heart failure. The combined administration of the two drugs leads to a favourable additive effect, with a decrease in the number and severity of side effects. The results of the ASCOT study proved a favourable effect with amlodipine based, combination therapy with an ACE-inhibitor, compared with the traditional beta-blockers and diuretics. The data of the CAFE sub-study showed, that in spite of the similar peripheral antihypertensive effect, the amlodipine based therapy decreased the central aortic pulse pressure to a greater extent. The central aortic pressure showed a good correlation with the end-points of the study, respectively. The results of the Hungarian multicenter study (HAMLET) proved the effective and safe administration of the two drugs in combination. Based on the above evidence, the fixed-dose combination of the CCB-ACE inhibitor (amlodipine-lisinopril) has not only effective blood pressure reducing properties, but also results in cardiovascular risk reduction, good tolerability and favourable compliance.",

Three of them, FCVLRP (a), IFVPAF (f) and KPPETV (j), were novel ACE inhibitory peptides. Their IC50 values were 12.3 microM, 3.4 microM and 24.1 microM, respectively, and their recoveries were 30 mg/100 g (solid basis of shrimp), 19 mg/100 g and 33 mg/100 g, respectively. Lineweaver-Burk plots for the three novel peptides showed that they are all competitive inhibitors. To test the ACE inhibitory activity of peptide a, f, j after they were digested by digestive enzymes in vivo, 12 derived peptides from FCVLRP and IFVPAF were synthesized based on their amino acid sequences and the cleavage sites of digestive enzymes. No digestive enzyme cleavage site was found in KPPETV. The IC50 values of the derived peptides were determined and the result showed that except for VPAF, FC and FCVL, the ACE inhibitory activity of the other nine derived peptides did not significantly change when compared with their original peptides. Surprisingly, five peptides had lower IC50 values than their original peptides, particularly for RP (IC50 value = 0.39 microM), which is about 30 times lower than its original peptide and almost the lowest IC50 value for ACE inhibitory peptides reported. Therefore, the novel peptides identified from A. chinensis hydrolysates probably still maintain a high ACE inhibitory activity even if they are digested in vivo. This is the first report about novel ACE inhibitory peptides from hydrolysates of marine shrimp A. chinensis. The novel peptides from hydrolysate of A. chinensis and some of their derived peptides with high ACE inhibitory activity probably have potential in the treatment of hypertension or in clinical nutrition.",

Aim of our study was to test the hypothesis, whether insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene and M235T polymorphism on angiotesinogen gene (AGT) correlates with parameters of insulin sensitivity and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) levels in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients as compared with normotensive controls. Blood pressure (BP), fasting plasma glucose, insulin, epinephrine, norepinephrine and PAI-1 concentrations were determined in 30 male patients with hypertension grade 1 (HT) and in 31 matched healthy subjects (NT). Insulin resistance was estimated using IR HOMA formula. Patients with HT had increased levels of PAI-1, norepinephrine, fasting plasma insulin levels, IR HOMA (p<0.001) compared to controls. Subjects (HT and NT) with DD and ID genotype had a significantly higher systolic BP (p<0.05) and PAI-1 compared to those with II genotype. Homozygous subjects 235T had a higher systolic BP and higher levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine than heterozygous or homozygous M235 (p<0.05). In conclusion, no association was found between M235T polymorphism and insulin resistance or PAI-1 levels, but results indicate relationship between I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and plasma PAI-1 levels in the early stage of hypertension.", 
    "283": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to improve splanchnic perfusion in distinct shock states. We hypothesized that enalaprilat potentiates the benefits of early fluid resuscitation in severe experimental sepsis, particularly in the splanchnic region. Anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs received an intravenous infusion of live Escherichia coli over a period of 30 min. Thereafter, two interventions were performed: fluid infusion (normal saline, 32 mL/kg over 30 min) and enalaprilat infusion (0.02 mg kg(-1) min(-1) for 60 min) in randomized groups. The following groups were studied: controls (fluid infusion, N = 4), E1 (enalaprilat infusion followed by fluid infusion, N = 5) and E2 (fluid infusion followed by enalaprilat infusion, N = 5). All animals were observed for a 120 min after bacterial infusion. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output (CO), portal vein blood flow (PVBF), systemic and regional oxygen-derived variables, and lactate levels were measured. Rapid and progressive reductions in CO and PVBF were induced by the infusion of live bacteria, while minor changes were observed in mean arterial pressure. Systemic and regional territories showed a significant increase in oxygen extraction and lactate levels. Widening venous-arterial and portal-arterial pCO2 gradients were also detected. Fluid replacement promoted transient benefits in CO and PVBF. Enalaprilat after fluid resuscitation did not affect systemic or regional hemodynamic variables. We conclude that in this model of normotensive sepsis inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme did not interfere with the course of systemic or regional hemodynamic and oxygen-derived variables.",

Primary myocardial involvement is common in SSc and, when clinically evident, appears as a poor prognostic factor. An increasing body of evidence suggests that myocardial involvement is due, at least in part, to microcirculation impairment with abnormal vasoreactivity, with or without associated structural abnormalities of the small coronary arteries or arterioles. Using conventional methods, myocardial perfusion impairment, systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular dysfunction have been reported in SSc. Recently, tissue Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging have confirmed these results. Vasodilators, such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, improve both myocardial perfusion and function abnormalities.",

    "293": "In crotaline venoms, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs, also known as bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs)], are products of a gene coding for an ACEI/BPP-C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) precursor. In the genes from Bothrops jararaca and Gloydius blomhoffii, ACEI/BPP sequences are repeated. Sequencing of a cDNA clone from venom glands of Crotalus durissus collilineatus showed that two ACEIs/BPPs are located together at the N-terminus, but without repeats. An additional sequence for CNP was unexpectedly found at the C-terminus. Homologous genes for the ACEI/BPP-CNP precursor suggest that most crotaline venoms contain both ACEIs/BPPs and CNP. The sequence of ACEIs/BPPs is separated from the CNP sequence by a long spacer sequence. Previously, there was no evidence that this spacer actually coded any expressed peptides. Aird and Kaiser (1986, unpublished) previously isolated and sequenced a peptide of 11 residues (TPPAGPDVGPR) from Crotalus viridis viridis venom. In the present study, analysis of the cDNA clone from C. d. collilineatus revealed a nearly identical sequence in the ACEI/BPP-CNP spacer. Fractionation of the crude venom by reverse phase HPLC (C(18)), and analysis of the fractions by mass spectrometry (MS) indicated a component of 1020.5 Da. Amino acid sequencing by MS/MS confirmed that C. d. collilineatus venom contains the peptide TPPAGPDGGPR. Its high proline content and paired proline residues are typical of venom hypotensive peptides, although it lacks the usual N-terminal pyroglutamate. It has no demonstrable hypotensive activity when injected intravenously in rats; however, its occurrence in the venoms of dissimilar species suggests that its presence is not accidental.

The application of these methods to live animals permits direct observation of acute physical responses that lack chemically detectable signals in the blood or urine and would otherwise remain unknown. With the use of special fluorescent dyes, chemical/hormonal responses may also be detected. The delivery and site-specific effects of drugs can be monitored in real-time. The capacity to simultaneously visualize both proximal and distal segments of the nephron permits observation of the dynamic processes within the living kidney and a quantitative assessment of the various operations. Consequently, a clinically valuable and pending application for multi-photon microscopy will be to provide real-time, quantitative imaging of basic organ functions and their responses to therapeutic intervention. Imaging of the intra-renal renin content and enzymatic activity of renin in situ and in real-time is a new, more informative measure of RAS activity. Direct visualization of the molecular and cellular components of renin release signals and the interactions between the vascular endothelium, tubular epithelium, local mediators, and the renin producing cells provides great insight for drug development. Examples of how the effects of various RAS inhibitors can be visualized in the intact kidney are provided: including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (captopril), angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade (olmesartan), and renin inhibition (aliskiren). The site-specific actions of diuretics, like furosemide, have also been visualized.

Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and selective blockade of Ang II AT1 receptors are two approaches through which the pathophysiological effects of Ang II can be targeted. Numerous clinical studies have established the benefits of ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) in lessening the morbidity and mortality burden of CVD. There are, however, tolerability concerns associated with ACE-Is, such as angioedema and dry cough. By blocking Ang II at the AT1 receptor level, Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) provide a more specific and complete blockade of the deleterious effects of Ang II and tend to have more favourable tolerability. A number of clinical trials have shown that ARBs are not only associated with positive outcomes across the CVD continuum but mat also have a role in the prevention or delay of diabetes (a major cardiovascular risk factor). Ongoing trials are aiming to define the place of such agents in lessening morbidity and mortality from CVD.",

However, there is controversy about whether specific classes of drug therapy have deleterious or beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Myths and misconceptions have thus arisen. Although \"old\" classes of antihypertensives, such as diuretics and beta-blockers, seem to have deleterious effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, the \"newer\" agents appear to have either neutral or beneficial profiles. The long-term significance of these metabolic changes is still debated. It is known that insulin resistance plays a major role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Treatment with beta-blockers appears to be less effective. The relative efficacy of various classes of antihypertensive drugs for lowering pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure is determined in part by their differing abilities to reduce pulse-wave reflection.

Similar results were obtained with the AT II type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan (8 mg): GFR remained stable, Na(+) excretion rose by 35 % and K(+) excretion was not changed. The effect of the Ca(2+) channel blocker amlodipine (5 mg) on GFR and HCT-induced Na(+) excretion equalled that obtained with the AT(1) blocker, yet with this treatment K(+) excretion rose in proportion to Na(+) excretion. The beta-blockers propranolol (80 mg) or bisoprolol (5 mg) reduced GFR but maintained TGF. HCT-induced Na(+) excretion was significantly reduced in the presence of a beta-blocker, whereas K(+) excretion was not changed. The inhibition of cyclooxygenase by diclofenac (50 mg) or rofecoxib (25 mg) significantly reduced the diuretic/natriuretic effect of HCT, but K(+) excretion was unchanged, and TGF was still demonstrable.", 
    "326": "In conclusion, AT(1) receptors, as well as the Ca(2+) channels in the smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole, are considered prerequisites for TGF function; their blockade increases the diuretic/natriuretic efficacy of thiazide diuretics. In contrast, beta-blockers and COX inhibitors do not interfere directly with TGF. These first dose effects reflect the primary response of the kidney to the drugs. They cannot, however, predict the benefits of long-term treatment.",

The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and unplanned heart failure related hospitalization with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. A total of 850 patients were randomized. Their mean age was 76 (SD 5) years and 55% were women. Median follow-up was 2.1 (IQR 1.5-2.8) years. Enrollment and event rates were lower than anticipated, reducing the power of the study to show a difference in the primary endpoint to 35%. Many patients withdrew from perindopril (28%) and placebo (26%) after 1 year and started taking open-label ACE-inhibitors. Overall, 107 patients assigned to placebo and 100 assigned to perindopril reached the primary endpoint (HR 0.919: 95% CI 0.700-1.208; P = 0.545). By 1 year, reductions in the primary outcome (HR 0.692: 95% CI 0.474-1.010; P = 0.055) and hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.628: 95% CI 0.408-0.966; P = 0.033) were observed and functional class (P < 0.030) and 6-min corridor walk distance (P = 0.011) had improved in those assigned to perindopril.",

In older subjects, systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are higher, whereas diastolic blood pressure is lower than in younger subjects.", 
    "354": "Patients with peripheral vascular disease are less likely to receive optimal medical management than patients with coronary artery disease. However, early medical treatment is critical because it is profoundly beneficial and the benefits are maximized. Even in patients with advanced disease requiring invasive intervention, medical management has been proven to improve outcome, prolong the success of the intervention, improve functional capacity, and prolong life. The vascular surgeon should be knowledgeable enough to initiate basic medical therapy and to define for their patients the goals that need to be met to optimize their medical management. The vascular surgeon should be instrumental in assuring that the peripheral vascular patient receives medical therapy of the same standard as the patient with coronary disease. The major modifiable risk factors in the vascular patient are: smoking, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes. In addition, the use of beta blockers for patients with coronary disease and antiplatelet therapy as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are recommended for all patients with peripheral vascular disease. Statins have favorable effects on multiple interrelated aspects of vascular biology important in atherosclerosis. In particular they have beneficial effects on inflammation, plaque stabilization, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombosis. Statins have also been shown to be beneficial in acute vascular events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with peripheral arterial disease regardless of the presence or absence of hypertension. A number of the pleiotropic effects of statins are shared by ACE inhibitors. In summary, patients with known vascular disease should be treated aggressively with a combination of a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an antiplatelet agent and a beta blocker if there is a history of coronary disease. They should also receive tight control of their blood pressure and blood sugar. Smokers should be encouraged to stop smoking and should be provided with pharmaceutical and emotional support by their physicians. All of these patients should have their body mass index as close to normal as possible and be on a therapeutic lifestyle diet. Regular aerobic exercise is also indicated. Patients with symptomatic claudication should be considered for cilostazol. Patients with multiple risk factors for vascular disease, but who do not have documented disease should also be on statin therapy. As more studies define the linear relationship between lower LDL-C levels and lowered risk of vascular events, indicating that the lower the LDL-C level, the lower the risk, experts are advocating more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. In patients with peripheral arterial disease, some experts now advocate lowering the goal of LDL therapy to 70 mg/dL.", 
    "355": "Some di-peptides have been proven to exert an antihypertensive effect in mild-hypertensive subjects. The aim of this study was to clarify whether combined administration of an ACE inhibitor, captopril, with an antihypertensive di-peptide Val-Tyr (VY) would alter their potent antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Single oral administration of captopril (2.5 mg/kg), VY (25 mg/kg), or captopril (2.5 mg/kg)+VY (25 mg/kg) to 18-week-old male SHRs was performed. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured up to 9 h, and plasma captopril concentrations were determined. A transport study of captopril and/or VY across living rat jejunum from SHRs was also performed to evaluate the kinetics of absorption. Combined administration of captopril with VY failed to lower the BP during the 9-h experiment. A transport study of captopril or VY revealed that VY inhibited captopril transport, and vice versa, in a competitive manner and exhibited an approximately 1/3-fold lower Ki value for captopril compared with that for VY; indicating that both compounds compete for the same membrane transport pathway. A 50% decrease in plasma captopril levels by combined administration with VY supported that the attenuation of the BP lowering effect was due to inhibition of captopril uptake by VY. Consequently, our findings suggest that subjects treated with ACE inhibitors for hypertension should avoid combined-intake with antihypertensive foods that are rich in small peptides due to the competitive inhibition of drug uptake by these peptides.",

At admission, discharge and at 12 months, acetylsalicylic acid was used in 71%, 92% and 87% of cases, respectively, and some form of antiplatelet agent was used in 74%, 94% and 89% of cases, respectively. The use of antilipid agents remained constant, from 55% at admission to 57% at discharge. However, 24% of patients were not receiving antilipid agents at 12 months. The use of beta-blockers was 57% at admission, 71% at discharge and 64% at 12 months. The use of calcium channel blockers and nitrates decreased modestly from admission to discharge and remained stable at approximately 20% and 22%, respectively, at 12 months. ACE inhibitor use remained stable, from 33% at admission to 38% at 12-months. Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity and pre-CABG surgery left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% were all found to be important determinants of 12-month medication use.

The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), the largest antihypertensive study conducted to date, randomized 42,418 participants to a diuretic (chlorthalidone), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), or an alpha-blocker (doxazosin). Patients who developed angioedema were compared for baseline characteristics and changes in antihypertensive drug administration. Fifty-three participants developed angioedema during active follow-up: 55% were black, 60% men, and 70% were assigned to lisinopril (including 62% of black participants with angioedema), 15% to chlorthalidone, 9% to doxazosin, and 6% to amlodipine. Six percent occurred within a day of randomization and 23% within the first week. Over half did not have an increase in their assigned (blinded) antihypertensive drug before angioedema onset; 3 (6%) had a dose increase within a week before onset. One patient died following an angioedema episode. The occurrence of angioedema in the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor arm corresponds with previously reported angioedema-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor associations.",

After 2 months (level 2), nonresponders received a low-dose thiazide diuretic, and after 4 months (level 3), amlodipine (groups E, C, and L) and carvedilol (group A). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure was significantly lowered in all treatment groups. Blood pressure control was more pronounced in patients receiving two or three drugs. At the end of the study, the carotid intima-media thickness decreased in group L (P<.01), left ventricular mass index in groups E and L (P<.05 and P<.001, respectively), with a concomitant reduction in cholesterol in group L (P<.03). Diastolic function improved significantly in group L (P<.05). This study describes the need to control blood pressure with two or more drugs in most hypertensive patients and illustrates good clinical outcomes, independent of blood pressure lowering, using combination therapy with losartan, low-dose thiazide, and amlodipine.",

We report on three cases of hypertension-induced LVH in the pediatric population and its regression after treatment with antihypertensive medications. This report brings to light the need for larger, prospective studies on the incidence, natural history, and treatment of LVH associated with hypertension in the pediatric population.",

    "366": "Heart failure (HF) remains a major public health problem, affecting 5 million patients in the United States. The personal burden of HF includes debilitating symptoms, activity limitations, frequent hospitalizations, arrhythmias, and increased mortality. Despite the compelling scientific evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists reduce hospitalizations and mortality in patients with HF, these life-prolonging therapies continue to be underutilized. Device therapy for HF, including implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy, has recently been demonstrated to also result in substantial mortality reduction. Accurate evaluation of patients with HF is critical for the appropriate selection and monitoring of therapy to reduce symptoms as well as for the prevention of recurrent hospitalizations. A number of studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of patients with HF are not receiving treatment with guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapies. Treatment gaps have also been documented in providing other components of care for patients with HF, including assessment for congestion and patient education. Recent studies demonstrate that hospital-based systems can improve medical care and education of hospitalized HF patients and accelerate use of evidence-based, guideline-recommended therapies by administering them before hospital discharge. HF disease management programs have also been shown to improve HF treatment, resulting in substantial reduction in hospitalizations and mortality. Application of validated and reproducible noninvasive techniques to monitor patients with chronic HF is an important step in maximizing interventions to improve outcomes in this patient population. Further efforts are clearly needed to improve the monitoring of HF patients in the hospital and outpatient settings, as well as to ensure the implementation of effective strategies and systems that increase the use of evidence-based therapies, in order to reduce the substantial HF morbidity and mortality risk.",

PRC was measured in plasma obtained by tail vein puncture. Basal PRC was significantly lower in COX-2-/- than WT mice independent of genetic background (51, 10, and 17% of WT in mixed, 129J, and C57BL/6). All five acute interventions caused significant increases of PRC in both COX-2+/+ and -/- mice, but the response was consistently less in COX-2-deficient mice (e.g., DeltaPRC in ng ANG I x ml(-1) x h(-1) caused by furosemide, isoproterenol, hydralazine, quinaprilate, or candesartan 4,699 +/- 544, 3,534 +/- 957, 2,522 +/- 369, 9,453 +/- 1,705, 66,455 +/- 21,938 in 129J WT, and 201 +/- 78, 869 +/- 275, 140 +/- 71, 902 +/- 304, 2,660 +/- 954 in 129J COX-2-/-). A low-NaCl diet and enalapril for 1 wk caused a 14-fold elevation of PRC in COX-2-/- mice and was associated with a greatly increased PRC response to acute furosemide (DeltaPRC 201 +/- 78 before and 15,984 +/- 2,397 after low Na/enalapril). As measured by radiotelemetry, blood pressure and heart rate responses to furosemide, hydralazine, isoproterenol, candesartan, or quinaprilate were not different between COX-2 genotypes. In conclusion, chronic absence of COX-2 reduces renin expression, release, and PRC and is associated with a reduced ability to alter PRC during acute stimulation regardless of the nature of the stimulus. COX-2 activity does not appear to be a mandatory and specific requirement for furosemide-stimulated renin secretion.",

These channels are located in the lipid layer of cell membranes where they exist as water channels through which ion transport is performed. Based on the type of genetic disorder and clinical presentation, Bartter's syndrome is classified as neonatal, classical and Gitelman's syndrome. Most of the cases have been noted in pediatric age groups and adult-onset cases are very rare. Moreover, an association between Bartter's syndrome and empty sella has recently been reported in 3 children. We report here the second case of an adult patient affected by Bartter's syndrome with partial empty sella. The patient showed some clinical and histological characteristics of both classic Bartter's syndrome and Gitelman's syndrome, suggesting that genotype and phenotype of Bartter's syndrome are not so clear-cut and that phenotypic overlap may occur, according to a recent hypothesis. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a partial empty sella. A thorough endocrinological investigation showed normal hypophyseal, thyroidal, adrenal and gonadal function.

It is also associated with underuse of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, yet the effect of these drugs in these (SHF-CKD) patients has not been well studied. The objective of this analysis was to determine if ACE inhibitor use was associated with reduction in mortality and hospitalization in SHF-CKD patients.",

Propensity scores for ACE inhibitor use were calculated for each of the 1707 patients and were used to match 104 of the 127 no-ACE inhibitor patients with 104 ACE inhibitor patients. We estimated the effect of ACE inhibitor use on outcomes at 2 years using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses. Overall, 35% of patients died and 67% were hospitalized.

Due to the age structure of our population and the increasing morbidity and comorbidity, one has to assume that this arrhythmia will reach an even higher prevalence. The therapeutic successes are often insufficient. First of all, it is important to diagnose and treat the underlying disease. Secondly, antiarrhythmic therapy has to be considered in symptomatic patients. In those patients and in the case of a persistent form, electrical cardioversion should be performed. Repetitive cardioversions in asymptomatic patients yield no advantage for mortality. Antiarrhythmic therapy consists of drugs of the classes Ia, Ic, and III. Concomitant anticoagulation is necessary; ASS in indicated only in patients without structural heart disease and lacking thromboembolic risk factors. If risk factors are present, effective therapy with coumarin derivatives is required. Therapy with ACE inhibitors and AT blockers leads to an advantage in patients with arterial hypertension and/or heart failure concerning the stability of sinus rhythm after cardioversion and the incidence of arrhythmia. Newer medications for anticoagulation and newer antiarrhythmic drugs raise the hope of a future therapy with higher efficacy and lower rate of side effects.",

All of the rats underwent right nephrectomy, and the rats in the IR and zofenopril+IR groups also underwent IR.then the left kidneys were removed for biochemical analyses and microscopic examination. There were no abnormalities in the biochemical and microscopic findings in the preoperative right kidneys. The lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and nitric oxide levels as well as xanthine oxidase and myeloperoxidase activities were increased and the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were decreased in the IR group; zofenopril treatment prevented these changes (p <0.05). In the IR group, the kidney sections showed severe acute tubular damage including brush border loss, nuclear condensation, cytoplasmic swelling, and loss of nuclei; in the zofenopril+IR group, the normal glomerular morphology was preserved and there was slight edema of the tubular cells. The renal damage score was significantly reduced in the zofenopril+IR group vs the IR group (p <0.05).

The purposes of this study were to describe the response to enalapril and its relation to dystrophin mutation type, ventricular size, or age at the onset of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Serial clinical and echocardiographic data from 50 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (aged 10 to 20 years) were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven patients (46%) developed LV systolic dysfunction (mean age 13.2 +/- 2.4 years). Ten (43%) responded to enalapril with the normalization of function. Responders and nonresponders developed LV systolic dysfunction at similar ages (p = 0.91). At the onset of LV systolic dysfunction, only 2 patients (1 responder, 1 nonresponder) had dilated left ventricles. The positive response to enalapril was sustained in 7 patients (median follow-up 23 months, range 5 to 58). No specific mutation was associated with the response to enalapril (p = 0.66) or predictive of the development of LV systolic dysfunction (p = 0.8).

Most patients had systolic HF (71%), and the remainder had HF with preserved ejection fractions (EFs). Patients with HF with preserved EFs tended to be generally older (67 vs 57 years, p = 0.01) and were more likely to be women (69% vs 42%, p = 0.02). There were no significant differences between patients with systolic HF and those with HF with preserved EFs in the prevalence of coronary artery disease (23%), diabetes mellitus (44%), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (38%). Gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia were significant contributors to admission in patients with preserved EFs, with baseline hematocrits being significantly lower (34.9 vs 38.3, p = 0.01).

Beta blockers and aspirin decrease the rate of AMI and blunt the peak incidence, but such an effect has not been evaluated for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The effect of ramipril on onset of symptomatic AMI was evaluated in 4-hour periods over a 24-hour cycle in men and women who were > or =55 years of age, had cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with > or =1 other risk factor, and participated in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial. During the 4.5-year follow-up, AMI was documented in 383 of 4,596 participants allocated to ramipril and in 491 of 4,598 participants allocated to placebo (8.3% vs 10.7%, p <0.001). Ramipril decreased rates of AMI at each period and attenuated, but did not blunt, the peak incidence.

    "385": "Anemia is prevalent in renal transplant recipients (RTRs), as it is in all chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations. Mild anemia occurs in up to 40% of RTRs, and more severe anemia (110 g/L) occurs in about 9% to 22% of patients. As in CKD, impaired graft (renal) function is a major predictor of anemia identified in nearly all studies, suggesting a major role for erythropoietin deficiency. Chronic inflammation, malnutrition, iron deficiency, and medications (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, mycophenolate, azathioprine, and sirolimus) are contributory factors seen in some, but not all, studies. Although pathophysiologic and observational data strongly support a causal association between low hemoglobin levels and cardiovascular outcomes in RTRs, no randomized controlled trial to date has been able to show a clear benefit of anemia treatment on cardiovascular outcomes or mortality in either RTR or other CKD populations. This important paradox has led some investigators to question the causal nature of the association between anemia and heart disease. Resolution of this paradox, at least for patients with stage 2/3 CKD, will depend on the outcome of randomized controlled trials currently in progress. Similar trials sorely are needed in renal transplant populations. In the interim, current opinion favors treating persistent anemia in RTRs to achieve targets similar to those recommended for dialysis and CKD patients.",

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a chronic, progressive disease representing the advanced stage of cardiac illnesses. Cognitive impairment is known to be a frequent feature of CHF patients. The epidemiologic pictures of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and CHF are predicted to worsen with the demographic expansion of the elderly population. Nevertheless, there has been little structured research on cognitive impairment in patients with CHF. This is unfortunate not only because CHF is the leading cause of hospitalization in the elderly and a leading cause of disability and death, but also for important clinical and socioeconomic implications including those related to comorbidity in advanced age and the need to early detect factors which may precipitate the conversion of MCI to AD. In this review, several aspects of the role of CHF in cognitive impairment are evaluated. Owing to the lack of studies focusing on CHF in AD, the pathophysiology of cardiac failure in cognitive impairment is addressed in light of possible preventive strategies against the onset of AD. These include prevention of oxygen radical and peroxynitrite production, supplementation of nitric oxide (NO) donors, as well as the achievement of an adequate antioxidant supply, better if obtained with a targeted and individualized nutritional approach. A systematic neuropsychologic testing of older patients with heart failure is to identify those with early cognitive impairment and promptly establish traditional therapies such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digoxin or beta-blockers. The neuropsychologic assessment in CHF patients is also fundamental to disclose conditions potentially favoring the onset of cognitive impairment such as depression. Finally, management schemes should include exercise training programs as well as patient and caregiver education.",

Emerging evidence from the prospective evaluations of secondary and tertiary outcomes and from retrospective evaluations in randomized controlled trials suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) may reduce the occurrence of new-onset diabetes. Therefore, we each independently searched MEDLINE for randomized controlled trials from January 1966-October 2005 that used an ACE inhibitor or ARB as a primary intervention versus a control group not receiving an ACE inhibitor or ARB and that reported the occurrence of diabetes. Thirteen trials were identified. In each of the 13 studies, the frequency of diabetes in the ACE inhibitor or ARB groups was lower than that in the control groups. In addition, it was consistent in that no study significantly excluded any benefit from ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the rate of new-onset diabetes.

The frequencies of the 235T allele are significantly different in black and white subjects. We analyzed the independent contribution of the angiotensinogen M235T mutation to the development of recurrent coronary events (coronary-related death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or unstable angina) in a cohort of 916 black (n=145) and white (n=771) postmyocardial infarction patients who were prospectively studied during an average follow-up of 28 months. The frequency of the 235T allele was significantly higher among black (82%) than among white (44%) patients (P<0.001). There was no evidence for Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. During follow-up, 41 cardiac events (28%) occurred in blacks and 197 (26%) in whites (P=0.49). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that 235T homozygosity was independently associated with increased risk of coronary events among black (hazard ratio: 2.37; P=0.04) but not white (hazard ratio: 0.93; P=0.68) patients, with a significant ethnic-related interaction effect (P for the difference=0.04). Among hypertensive black patients, the TT genotype was associated with a 3.3-fold (P=0.02) increase in the risk of coronary events. Our findings suggest that homozygosity for the 235T mutation in the angiotensinogen gene is an independent risk factor for coronary events in black postmyocardial infarction patients.

    "415": "C-reactive protein (CRP) plays a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. It is a marker and predictor of cardiovascular disease. CRP possesses numerous cardiovascular effects (clotting, generation of oxygen radicals, increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, plaque destabilization) that could result in cardiovascular disease. This review describes the effects of various cardiovascular drugs on the levels of CRP in health and disease. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin, rofecoxib, celecoxib), platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, abciximab), lipid lowering agents (statins, ezetimibe, fenofibrate, niacin, diets), beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists and antioxidants (vitamin E), as well as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ramipril, captopril, fosinopril), reduce serum levels of CRP; while enalapril and trandolapril have not been shown to have the same effect. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (valsartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, telmisartan) markedly reduce serum levels of CRP. The findings with other ARBs (losartan and candesartan) were inconsistent. Antidiabetic agents (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) reduce CRP levels, while insulin is ineffective. Calcium channel antagonists have variable effects on CRP levels. Hydrochlorothiazide and oral estrogen do not affect CRP. The CRP-lowering effect of statins is more pronounced than their lipid lowering effect and is not dependent on their hypolipemic activity. The effect of atorvastatin on CRP seems to be dose-dependent. CRP-lowering effect of statins is likely to contribute to the favorable outcome of statin therapy. The data suggest that lipid lowering agents, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, antidiabetic agents, antiinflammatory and antiplatelet agents, vitamin E, and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists lower serum or plasma levels of CRP, while vitamin C, oral estrogen and hydrochlorothiazide do not affect CRP levels.",

There were no changes in normal kidney function group (4.58 +/- 0.37 vs. 4.63 +/- 0.44). At baseline plasmatic creatinine was higher in the CRF group (2.09 +/- 0.60 0.20 mg/dl vs. 0.99 +/- 0.20 mg/dl, p < 0.001, Student's t-test) and creatinine clearance was lower (48.6 +/- 20.7 ml/min vs. 107.0 +/- 0.30 ml/min, p < 0.001, Student's t-test). There was a small increase in creatinine along the follow-up when compared with the normal renal function group (p < 0.001, anova). Conversely, creatinine clearance remain unchanged in the normal renal function group, and there was a decrease in creatinine in CRF patients (p < 0.001). Dual RAS blockade seems to be safe in renal patients even when mild to moderate renal failure is present. Severe hyperkalaemia is uncommon. Small increments in plasmatic creatinine can be seen but they are hardly dangerous. Combined treatment does not significantly influence erythropoiesis.", 
    "417": "Today management of atrial fibrillation (AF) centers on restoration and maintenance of normal sinus rhythm or control of the ventricular rate response to AF. Current guidelines state that rhythm and rate control strategies should be considered therapeutically equivalent, but recognize that no \"one size fits all,\" an approach consistent with growing recognition of the heterogeneity of AF. As data from the Sotalol Amiodarone Atrial Fibrillation Efficacy Trial clearly demonstrate, conventional antiarrhythmics have a role in highly symptomatic AF accompanied by decreased quality of life. However, for many AF patients such drugs lack efficacy, have potentially serious side effects, and are poorly tolerated. In parallel with the development of more effective and safer antiarrhythmics, nontraditional approaches to prevention and treatment of AF are being explored. Treatments not considered \"antiarrhythmic\" that may prevent or forestall AF include aggressive antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and some, but not all, beta-blockers and calcium channel antagonists, especially when used as adjunctive therapy. Other approaches include statins, steroids, and fish oil to reduce atrial fibrosis and inflammation, and pacemakers to prevent bradycardia-mediated AF and as a pacing preventive strategy in selected patients. Ablative techniques with potential to cure AF are gaining popularity, but are not yet simple, straightforward, and risk-free procedures. In the future, treatment of AF will progress beyond today's focus on AF as a purely electrocardiographic disease toward a patient and context-specific management strategy involving multiple treatment modalities.",

International recommendations currently stress the importance of reaching values of below 140/90 mmHg in each patient or even lower in the case of concomitant diabetes or renal impairment. It is currently considered crucial to control the systolic pressure as well as the diastolic pressure, in particular because the relationship between cardiovascular risk and blood pressure is closer for the systolic than the diastolic value. An increase in systolic pressure is in itself a sign of the stiffening of the arterial tree. In most patients, the target pressure may only be reached by combining several different antihypertensive agents. In the STRATHE Study, a greater antihypertensive efficacy, in particular on systolic pressure, was obtained by instituting treatment with a fixed low-dose combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) and a diuretic (indapamide), in comparison with other therapeutic strategies based on single-agent therapy. Fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations have now become a validated option for initiating antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "425": "Structural alterations in the microcirculation form a major link between hypertension and target organ damage. More than 60% of the overall peripheral resistance of the circulatory system arises at the level of the microcirculation. The primary function of the microcirculation is to supply oxygen and nutrients to tissues. In hypertension, remodelling of the microvascular vessels occurs, leading to an early, functional then anatomical reduction in the number of arterioles or capillaries in a given vascular bed. Such changes have been seen in the structure and density of the microvasculature of different target organs such as the myocardium and the kidneys. In hypertension, capillary rarefaction induces an increase in blood pressure, a relative decrease in tissue perfusion and an increased cardiovascular risk. Recent in-vivo non-invasive techniques for exploring the human microcirculation have allowed the detection of myocardial and renal microvascular impairment in hypertensive patients. In comparative therapeutic studies, antihypertensive drugs have been shown to have different capacities for preventing or reversing changes to the microvasculature of affected organs.",

Since it had been established that simultaneous administration of both drugs may alter the antihypertensive effect of captopril. In order to find out the kinetics and energitics of captopril in presence of NSAID's, these studies were carried out in buffers of pH 4, 7.4 and 9 at 37 degrees C and at elevated temperatures. These studies clearly indicate that most of the NSAID's bind to captopril, forming charge-transfer complexes revealing that the availability of captopril can be affected by the concurrent administration of NSAID's. Accordingly coadministration of both the drugs should be avoided.",

The LVH cats were assigned to the placebo group or the enalapril group (0.5 mg/kg, PO, sid) 3 months following surgery, and each received its respective drug for 4 weeks. Each week, blood pressure, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in blood, and creatinine clearance were measured, and complete blood count (CBC), biochemical examination of the blood, echocardiography, and chest radiography were carried out. The interventricular septum thickness (IVSd, IVSs), fractional shortening (FS), and ejection fraction (EF) increased significantly in the LVH cats following surgery (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the placebo group and the enalapril group with respect to general physical parameters, CBC, biochemical parameters and renal function. In the enalapril group, systolic arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure, and ACE activity in blood decreased significantly following administration (P<0.05). In addition, the left ventricular free wall thickness in diastole and IVSd decreased significantly following administration (P<0.05). These results suggest that, in a pressure overload model, enalapril (0.5 mg/kg, sid) inhibits cardiac hypertrophy, reduces blood pressure, and does not adversely affect renal function.",

    "442": "The addition of new agents to the armamentarium of treatment options for heart failure in pediatric patients is exciting and challenging. Administration of these therapies to pediatric patients will require careful scrutiny of the data and skilled application. Developmental changes in drug metabolism, excretion, and distribution are concerning in pediatric patients, and inappropriate evaluation of these parameters can have disastrous results. Manipulation of the neurohormonal pathways in heart failure has been the target of most recently developed pharmacologic agents. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), aldosterone antagonists, beta-blockers, and natriuretic peptides are seeing increased use in pediatrics. In particular, calcium sensitizing agents represent a new frontier in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure and may replace traditional inotropic therapies. Endothelin receptor antagonists have shown benefit in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, but their use in heart failure is still debatable. Vasopressin antagonists, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and neutral endopeptidase inhibitors are also targeting aspects of the neurohormonal cascade that are currently not completely understood. The future of pharmacologic therapies will include pharmacogenomic studies on new and preexisting therapies for pediatric heart failure.

This study aims to review the incidence and mechanisms of chronic nephropathy following heart transplantation, and suggest therapeutic directions. The proportion of pediatric heart-transplant recipients with impaired renal function varies from 22 to 57%, and end-stage renal failure from 3 to 10%, depending on the method used for estimating the glomerular filtration rate. The pathophysiology of renal dysfunction is in part due to calcineurin inhibitor-induced renal vasoconstriction, through activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system, TGF-beta1 upregulation and TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms. Overproduction of angiotensin II, associated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme genotype, might be associated with poor prognosis and pharmacological factor gene polymorphisms, and may contribute to variation of calcineurine inhibitor exposure in the kidney. Strategies to prevent renal dysfunction include reducing calcineurine inhibitor exposure or delaying calcineurine inhibitor administration from the early post-transplant period. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, blockade of angiotensin II, or anti-TGF-beta1 antibodies might limit nephrotoxicity. No accurate marker can predict the potential of renal lesions to develop. Lowering calcineurine inhibitors levels with immunosuppressive agents that are either less nephrotoxic or non-nephrotoxic should be formally studied. Of high interest is the impact of genetic polymorphism on the development of renal dysfunction.",

    "449": "Primary aldosteronism is caused by bilateral idiopathic hyperplasia in approximately two-thirds of cases and aldosterone-producing adenoma in one-third. Most patients with primary aldosteronism are normokalemic. In the clinical setting of normokalemic hypertension, patients who have resistant hypertension and hypertensive patients with a family history atypical for polygenic hypertension should be tested for primary aldosteronism. The ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity has been generally accepted as a first-line case-finding test. If a patient has an increased ratio, autonomous aldosterone production must be confirmed with an aldosterone suppression test. Once primary aldosteronism is confirmed, the subtype needs to be determined to guide treatment. The initial test in subtype evaluation is CT imaging of the adrenal glands. If surgical treatment is considered, adrenal vein sampling is the most accurate method for distinguishing between unilateral and bilateral adrenal aldosterone production. Optimal treatment for aldosterone-producing adenoma or unilateral hyperplasia is unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The idiopathic bilateral hyperplasia and glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism subtypes should be treated pharmacologically. All patients treated pharmacologically should receive a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, a drug type that has been shown to block the toxic effects of aldosterone on nonepithelial tissues.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type I receptor blockers slow progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN); however, as drugs of this class are not IgAN specific and are therefore unlikely to alter significantly its natural course, many other therapeutic approaches have been proposed. Most have been tested in a relatively small number of patients and have not yet proven to be effective in the long term. Conflicting and variable data, and a lack of long-term prospective randomized studies, mean that most treatments cannot be recommended as standard therapy for IgAN. Steroids seem to be the best treatment for patients with proteinuria, as drugs in this class ameliorate this symptom and protect against deterioration of renal function. Combined treatment with corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs has yielded interesting results in several studies, especially in progressive patients with severe IgAN. In this review, we critically analyze the data on these treatments.",

Accordingly, we reviewed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists because these drugs prolong life and are included in current clinical practice guidelines for treating patients with chronic HF. We also reviewed the implications of chronic HF for patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia and discuss how best to provide intensive treatment for acute exacerbations of symptoms, such as might be caused by excessive intravascular volume, inappropriate drug \"holidays,\" or worsening of the underlying cardiac disease.",

Despite this, patients with PAD had a nearly twofold higher risk of major cardiovascular events at 6 months than non-PAD patients (7.3% vs 4.1%; P < .0001). After adjustment for multiple confounding factors, the presence of PAD at baseline continued to predict a heightened risk of adverse vascular sequelae (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.01; P < .0001).",

    "456": "This study was designed to examine the in vivo and in vitro effects of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on nicotine-induced endothelial dysfunction in rats. Endothelial dysfunction was induced by exposing isolated rat mesenteric arteries to nicotine (0.01, 0.1, or 1 mM) for 24 hr using an organ culture system, or by treating rats with nicotine (2 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally) for 4 weeks. The protective effects of captopril were tested by exposing isolated mesenteric arteries to captopril (0.01, 0.03, or 0.1 mM) + nicotine (0.1 mM) for 24 hr, or by treating rats with captopril (3 mg/kg/day, intravenously) + nicotine (2 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally) for 4 weeks. Exposure of the isolated mesenteric arteries to nicotine induced a significant concentration -dependent inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation. Co-culture of segments of mesenteric artery with captopril (0.03 or 0.1 mM) attenuated the nicotine-induced impairment of vasorelaxation in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of nicotine to rats for 4 weeks significantly impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation compared with control rats. This impairment was accompanied by a reduction in nitrite/nitrate, nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the serum and aorta. Chronic captopril treatment not only improved the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation, but also prevented the reduction of nitrite/nitrate contents and of NOS and SOD activities in the serum and aorta. However, there were no significant differences in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity among the three groups. These results indicate that captopril can be used to attenuate nicotine-induced endothelial dysfunction, an effect that may be related not only to antioxidation, but also to enhancing NO production by preventing the decrease in NOS.",

In addition, significantly more patients with effective aspirin inhibition were hypertensive (80% vs 62%; p < 0.05). Patients who had effective platelet aggregation were significantly more likely to be taking beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (75% vs 55%; p < 0.05) and ACE inhibitors (70% vs 50%; p < 0.05), whereas patients with ineffective platelet aggregation were significantly more likely to be taking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) [52% vs 38%; p < 0.05].

    "460": "The mechanisms underlying aspirin resistance are multifactorial. Higher fibrinogen concentrations increase RBC aggregation and can also result in increased platelet aggregation. The higher rate of hypertension in patients with effective platelet aggregation on aspirin could explain the differences in beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and ACE inhibitor use between these patients and aspirin-resistant patients. Furthermore, an additive effect of these drugs may contribute to effective antiplatelet therapy. It is also possible that drug interactions with statins might reduce aspirin bioavailability and/or activity, thereby reducing platelet inhibition in aspirin-resistant patients.",

This finding raises the question on the pathophysiological role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the Metabolic Syndrome. Inappropriate activation of the RAAS in the circulation but also on the tissue level, suggests profound changes in the regulation of this system in the Metabolic Syndrome. Possible physiological and molecular mechanisms that link the RAAS with the Metabolic Syndrome include interactions between insulin and angiotensin type 1-receptors, hemodynamic effects that change nutrient partition to tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, inhibition of adipogenesis which may limit the storage capacity of adipose tissue and allows ectopic lipid storage which leads to lipotoxicity, influence on adipokine secretion, and influence on insulin secretion from pancreatic Beta-cells. Most of these mechanisms are linked with decreased insulin sensitivity. Convincing experimental evidence on these possible mechanisms, however, is rare, and several obscurities remain, which are partly due to species differences between rodent models and humans. Thus, data from clinical trials clearly suggest that the RAAS plays an important role for the pathophysiology of the Metabolic Syndrome, but the molecular mechanisms are not understood very well at present.",

    "474": "The total number of 'serious' ADRs registered in the French PharmacoVigilance Database in patients older than 70 years was similar in 2003 (a year with heat wave) and in 2002 (a year without heat wave). Sixty-eight ADRs [27 'possible' (I1), 27 'plausible' (I2) and 14 'likely' (I3)] related to heat occurred in 2003, with a maximal peak between the 28th July and the 17th August. The most frequently ADRs were metabolic (dehydratation, hydroelectrolytic disturbances) and neuropsychiatric (confusion, falls, coma). Drugs more frequently involved were diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, antidepressants (mainly serotonin reuptake inhibitors), proton pump inhibitors, digoxin, benzodiazepines, oral hypoglycemics and sartans.",

    "476": "The influence of diabetes mellitus on the process of cell communication and impulse propagation was investigated in trabeculae isolated from the ventricle of diabetic rat hearts. Diabetes was produced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/Kg). Cell-to-cell spread of Lucifer yellow CH was studied with the cut-end method. Measurements of the diffusion coefficient of Lucifer Yellow CH (D) was made by fitting the experimental results to theoretical points using an interactive computer program for non-linear regression. The results indicated an average value of D of 3 +/- 0.8x10(-7 )cm(2)/s for the controls (n = 5) and 3.8 +/- 0.5x10(-8 )cm(2)/s (n = 7) (p < 0.05) for diabetic hearts. No change of efflux of the dye through the surface cell membrane was found in diabetic rat compared to controls (p > 0.05). Moreover, the dye binding in the cytosol of diabetic heart was not significantly different from controls. The calculated values of junctional permeability for the dye was found to be p (j) = 1.5x10(-3 )cm/s for control and 1.5x10(-5 )cm/s for diabetic heart. To investigate the possible role of the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on the change in cell communication, diabetic rats were treated with enalapril (25 mg/Kg/day) for a period of 14 days. Measurements of the diffusion coefficient (D) of the dye indicated a significant increase of D (6.7 +/- 1.1x10(-7 )cm(2)/s) (n = 4) (p < 0.05) compared with diabetic rats not exposed to enalapril. No change on efflux of the dye or cytoplasmic binding was found in animals treated with enalapril. The calculated value of junctional permeability showed a significant increase (p (j) = 3.9x10(-4 )cm/s) in presence of enalapril compared with controls. In addition, angiotensin II (10(-8 )M) added to the bath caused a significant decrease of conduction velocity in cardiac muscle of diabetic heart. In conclusion, Cell communication and impulse propagation are significantly impaired in the ventricle from diabetic rats, a phenomenon partly related to the activation of the RAS.",

The study consisted of 2 phases, 3 months each, for an overall 6-month observation time. During phase 1 (3 months), each child was assigned randomly to treatment with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist alone. During phase 2, each child was advanced to combination therapy with the addition of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, respectively.

At 2 months after diagnosis, 75% of those who eventually recovered had an EF >45%. Factors associated with lack of recovery at initial assessment were a left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension >5.6 cm, the presence of LV thrombus, and African-American race.

In the present study, we tested whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril) could mediate delayed preconditioning and, thus, cardioprotection. 2. New Zealand white rabbits received 15 mL infusion of either saline (control group; n = 7) or drugs (0.3 mg/kg captopril (CAP group; n = 7) or 0.3 mg/kg captopril + 0.1 mg/kg HOE 140 (CAPHOE group; n = 7)) via a marginal ear vein over 30 min. After 24 h, hearts were connected to a Langendorff apparatus and buffer perfused. The experimental protocol consisted of 20 min global normothermic hypoxia, followed by 120 min reperfusion. 3. Compared with baseline, the mean (SEM) contractile state (= dP/dt(max)) at 120 min reperfusion was decreased to 42 +/- ;23, 72 +/- ;16 (*P < 0.05 vs control) and 49 +/- ;22% in the control, CAP and CAPHOE groups, respectively. Early relaxation (= dP/dt(min)) was reduced to 55 +/- ;28, 73 +/- ;15 (*P < 0.05 vs control) and 52 +/- ;19% in the control, CAP and CAPHOE groups, respectively. The estimate for myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO(2)= rate-pressure product) was decreased to 52 +/- ;15, 69 +/- ;24 (*P < 0.05 vs control) and 56 +/- ;15% in the control, CAP and CAPHOE groups, respectively. Similarly, coronary flow was decreased in the control, CAP and CAPHOE groups to 49 +/- ;20, 67 +/- ;18 and 46 +/- ;19%, respectively. In contrast, ventricular extrasystoles during reperfusion were significantly elevated in both the CAP and CAPHOE groups (1.3 +/- ;0.2 and 1.1 +/- ;0.3 /min, respectively) compared with control (0.4 +/- ;0.2 /min). 4. Captopril confers delayed preconditioning against stunning via a B(2) receptor-mediated pathway. This pharmacological preconditioning protects against systolic and diastolic stunning, against vascular stunning and preserves cardiac metabolism. In addition to its accepted cardioprotective effects in early preconditioning, captopril should induce delayed preconditioning (e.g. for routine interventional cardiology or in elective cardiac surgery).", 
    "494": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metallopeptidase which plays a key role in the regulation of important vasoactive peptides through its proteolytic activity. Effective inhibitors of ACE were until recently designed in the absence of the solved 3D structure of this enzyme. About 15 ACE inhibitors are currently commercially available, all of which nonspecifically inhibit both active domains of ACE. Vasopeptidase inhibitors are mixed inhibitors of ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). They contemporarily inhibit the catalytic function of two enzymes and currently are undergoing clinical trials exhibiting better efficacy in the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, but in the same time higher risk of adverse side effects compared to ACE inhibitors.", 
    "495": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) in elderly patients and patients with renal and hepatic impairment were examined, and a role for an AUC/EC50 ratio to guide dosing was evaluated. A Medline and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts search was used to identify human studies and abstracts. Relevant data were evaluated and summarized. Dosing regimens were compared using an AUC/EC50 ratio. Most studies evaluating ACE inhibitors in renal impairment report a strong linear correlation between creatine clearance and drug elimination. AUC and EC50 values for these drugs in elderly subjects appear similar to younger and hypertensive patients. There is increased AUC in some patients with hepatic impairment. Pharmacodynamic data are conflicting. Prolonged ACE inhibition is evident in renal impairment but not necessarily other disease states. ACE inhibitor dosing for hypertension is reasonable based on pharmacokinetics and EC50 values. Further individualization of therapy may improve outcomes, and using the threshold AUC/EC50 ratio may help guide appropriate dosing.", 
    "496": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a disorder in which initial left ventricular systolic dysfunction and symptoms of heart failure occur between the late stages of pregnancy and the early postpartum period. It is common in some countries and rare in others. The causes and pathogenesis are poorly understood. Molecular markers of an inflammatory process are found in most patients. Clinical presentation includes usual signs and symptoms of heart failure, and unusual presentations relating to thromboembolism. Clinicians should consider PPCM in any peripartum patient with unexplained disease. Conventional heart failure treatment includes use of diuretics, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Effective treatment reduces mortality rates and increases the number of women who fully recover left ventricular systolic function. Outcomes for subsequent pregnancy after PPCM are better in women who have first fully recovered heart function. Areas for future research include immune system dysfunction, the role of viruses, non-conventional treatments such as immunosuppression, immunoadsorption, apheresis, antiviral treatment, suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, and strategies for control and prevention.",

For primary prevention, we used aspirin, a calcium-channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and a statin, and assessed them in four groups with different thresholds of absolute risks for cardiovascular disease. For secondary prevention, we assessed the same combination of drugs in one group, but substituted a beta blocker for the calcium-channel blocker. To compare strategies, we report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), in US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).",

Across six developing World Bank regions, primary prevention yielded ICERs of US746-890 dollars/QALY gained for patients with a 10-year absolute risk of cardiovascular disease greater than 25%, and 1039-1221 dollars/QALY gained for those with an absolute risk greater than 5%. ICERs for secondary prevention ranged from 306 dollars/QALY to 388 dollars/QALY gained.",

Adjustment for demographic characteristics, risk factors for rupture, comorbidities, contraindications to ACE inhibitors, measures of health-care use, and aneurysm screening yielded similar results (0.83, 0.73-0.95). Consistent findings were noted in subgroups at high risk of rupture, including patients older than 75 years and those with a history of hypertension. Conversely, such protective associations were not observed for beta blockers (1.02, 0.89-1.17), calcium channel blockers (1.01, 0.89-1.14), alpha blockers (1.15, 0.86-1.54), angiotensin receptor blockers (1.24, 0.71-2.18), or thiazide diuretics (0.91, 0.78-1.07).",

    "505": "Hypertension is a cardiovascular risk factor commonly associated with insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent in vitro data indicate that certain angiotensin receptor antagonists, for example, telmisartan, activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and increase adiponectin protein content in adipocytes. By this means, they may improve insulin sensitivity in vivo. To investigate the effect of antihypertensive treatment on insulin sensitivity and fasting adiponectin serum levels, 37 nondiabetic patients with essential hypertension were randomized to receive telmisartan, the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine, or their combination for 6 weeks in a prospective, parallel group study. Fasting serum glucose, insulin, and adiponectin were evaluated before, 3 weeks (low dose), and 6 weeks (high dose) after initiation of treatment. Furthermore, the effect of telmisartan on PPAR-gamma receptor activity was investigated in vitro using a PPAR-gamma reporter gene assay. As reported previously, telmisartan significantly enhanced PPAR-gamma receptor activity in vitro. At baseline, a positive correlation between insulin serum levels and body mass index of investigated subjects was observed, whereas body mass index and serum adiponectin levels were negatively associated. High-dose treatment with telmisartan but not with nisoldipine reduced serum insulin levels as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, but did not affect serum adiponectin levels. In conclusion, in our study cohort of nondiabetic patients with essential hypertension, telmisartan improved insulin sensitivity by mechanisms apparently not involving adiponectin induction. Future studies will demonstrate whether these telmisartan-induced effects may contribute to a blood pressure-independent reduction in cardiovascular morbidity.",

The measurement of acute physical status needs to be completed with examination of genotype, which is related to the athletic excellence also, because the D allele could be associated with good performance by endurance athletes in future world championships. Further studies are needed to assess the view that the ACE D allele has a significant role in athletic efficiency.",

The drug is well tolerated, and its metabolic effects include improvements in blood glucose and lipid control. Vascular effects consist of improvements in endothelial function and hypertension, and a reduction in surrogate markers of artherosclerosis. In a large, placebo-controlled, outcome study in secondary prevention, PROactive study, the use of pioglitazone in addition to an existing optimized macrovascular risk management resulted in a significant reduction of macrovascular endpoints within a short observation period that was comparable to the effect of statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in other trials.

    "511": "Our laboratory uses a model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) induced by placental insufficiency in the rat to examine the developmental origins of adult disease. In this model only male IUGR offspring remain hypertensive in adulthood, revealing sex-specific differences. The purpose of this study was to determine whether testosterone with participation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) contributes to hypertension in adult male IUGR offspring. At 16 wk of age a significant increase in testosterone (346 +/- 34 vs. 189 +/- 12 ng/dl, P < 0.05) was associated with a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured by telemetry in IUGR offspring (147 +/- 1 vs. 125 +/- 1 mmHg, P < 0.05, IUGR vs. control, respectively). Gonadectomy (CTX) at 10 wk of age significantly reduced MAP by 16 wk of age in IUGR offspring (124 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.05 vs. intact IUGR) but had no effect in control (125 +/- 2 mmHg). A significant decrease in MAP in intact IUGR (111 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.05 vs. untreated intact IUGR) and castrated IUGR (110 +/- 4 mmHg, P < 0.05 vs. untreated CTX IUGR) after treatment with enalapril for 2 wk suggests a role for RAS involvement. However, the decrease in blood pressure in response to enalapril was greater in intact IUGR (Delta36 +/- 1 mmHg, P < 0.05) compared with CTX IUGR (Delta15 +/- 2 mmHg), indicating an enhanced response to RAS blockade in the presence of testosterone. Thus these results suggest that testosterone plays a role in modulating hypertension in adult male IUGR offspring with participation of the RAS.",

In order to avoid the high risks involved in handling SARS-CoV and to facilitate the study of viral fusion mechanism, we established the cell lines: SR-COS7 cells that stably express both SARS-CoV S protein and red fluorescence protein, R-COS7 cells that stably express red fluorescence protein, and AG-COS7 cells that stably express both ACE2 and green fluorescence protein, respectively. When SR-COS7 cells or R-COS7 cells were cocultured with AG-COS7 cells, syncytia with yellow fluorescence were conveniently observed after 12 h in SR-COS7 cells plus AG-COS7 cells, but not in R-COS7 cells plus AG-COS7 cells. The cell-to-cell fusion efficiency was simply determined for quantitative analysis based on the number of syncytium detected by flow cytometry. Such new cell-to-cell fusion model was further assessed by the potent HR2 peptide inhibitor, which led to the obvious decrease of the cell-to-cell fusion efficiency. The successful fusion and inhibition of cell-based binding assay shows that it can be well used for the study of SARS-CoV entry and inhibition.",

The patients were randomized on A) ACE-inhibitor--Fosinopril and B) without ACE inhibitor--atenolol, and they were followed up 9 months. The groups were not different by age, sex, and metabolic status. Color Duplex ultrasonography of the carotid arteries was performed by Acuson Sequia C236 with high-frequency linear probe of 8 MHz. The intima-media thickness of the common carotids on the left and the right was measured in diastole at 1.5 cm from the highest point of bifurcation under maximal magnification. Using the same device, the left ventricle mass and other parameters of the left ventricle were determined in M-mode and by means of 2D image.",

The thickness of the intimomedial complex in patients using Fosinopril was decreased by 0.0278 +/- 0.03 mm, while in the group of patients that did not use the ACE-inhibitor, it was increased by 0.078 +/- 0.13 mm. The left ventricle mass in patients using Fosinopril was decreased by 5 grams (312 +/- 72 g vs. 307 +/- 77 g), while in group B patients, it was increased by 15 grams (323 +/- 79 g vs. 328 +/- 58 g. Diastolic function expressed through relation E/A was improved minimally in the group A, while it worsened by 0.1 in the group B. After 9 months, serious cardiovascular events were recorded (one infarction of myocardium and one hospitalization due to the unstable angina pectoris) in two patients of the group A, while four patients of the group B had serious CV events (1 cerebrovascular stroke and 3 hospitalizations due to unstable angina pectoris).", 
    "517": "The results of our study showed that the application of Fosinopril in patients with the arterial hypertension and the left ventricle hypertrophy could efficiently block further progression of the intima-medial thickness of the common carotid artery, reduce the left ventricle mass, and improve diastolic function of the left ventricle.", 
    "518": "The cardiovascular continuum describes the progression of pathophysiologic events from cardiovascular risk factors to symptomatic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and life-threatening events. Pharmacologic intervention early in the continuum may prevent or slow CVD development and improve quality of life. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is central to the pathophysiology of CVD at many stages of the continuum. Numerous clinical trials of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown that RAAS blockade provides benefits to patients across the continuum. ARBs are as effective as ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension; however tolerability and adherence to therapy appear to be improved with ARBs. Large clinical trials have shown that ARBs may provide therapeutic benefits beyond blood pressure control in patients with diabetes, heart failure or at risk of heart failure following a myocardial infarction. In addition, ARBs have been shown to provide protective effects in patients with impaired renal function or left ventricular hypertrophy. Additional clinical trials are ongoing to further characterize the role of ARBs in CVD management.",

The development of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has provided physicians with effective and well-tolerated inhibitors of the RAS. However, it remains open to question whether ACE inhibitors and ARBs have fully delivered the reductions in cardiovascular risk that we might have expected. There is little doubt that in conditions such as chronic and acute heart failure or diabetic nephropathy these drugs have provided significant protection. But, in patients with high-risk hypertension, for instance, the anticipated benefits of RAS blockade have been less obvious. This article provides a critical assessment of the results of clinical trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs across a variety of clinical conditions and assesses the potential need for new methods for blocking the renin system, including the use of renin inhibitors.",

    "521": "In a prospective double-blind study, patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease were treated with either 40 mg telmisartan (n = 21) or placebo (n = 21) for 12 weeks. General markers of inflammation, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cell adhesion molecules, such as soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (s-ICAM-1) and the leucocyte adhesion molecule soluble-L-selectin (sL-selectin), as well as the lymphocytic expression of the beta2 integrin MAC-1, were assessed before and after treatment. Telmisartan therapy significantly decreased the lymphocyte beta2 integrin MAC-1 expression, whereas hs-CRP, IL-6, s-ICAM and sL-selectin remained unaltered. In-vitro experiments were conducted to clarify the mode of action. Cultured human lymphocytes were stimulated with either angiotensin II or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin, alone or after pretreatment with telmisartan.

    "523": "Stroke represents the most devastating cardiovascular disease in the Western world, accounting for approximately 700,000 cases each year, including 500,000 first attacks and 200,000 recurrent episodes. High blood pressure is the most relevant modifiable risk factor for developing stroke.", 
    "524": "In hypertensive patients, especially those with additional cardiovascular risk factors or clinical settings such as diabetes, target organ damage or associated clinical conditions, even small decreases in blood pressure levels are associated with large reductions in the incidence of cerebrovascular events. The benefits of blood pressure reductions, however, are not strictly proportional to stroke incidence, and it has been recently postulated that the different classes of antihypertensive drugs may have specific properties for organ protection and cerebrovascular accident prevention.",

Metabolic syndrome can be considered as a prediabetic state very frequently associated with arterial hypertension, requiring pharmacological therapy.", 
    "527": "All antihypertensive therapies have been shown to reduce the risk of total major cardiovascular events. Recently, the relevance of the type of hypertensive therapy used to treat hypertensive patients in facilitating the development of diabetes has been demonstrated in different trials. The recognition of the risk present in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome for developing diabetes reinforces the need to consider the ideal antihypertensive therapy, either mono or combination, in these patients.", 
    "528": "This brief review contains the available evidence showing that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker is the most suitable therapy to be started in these patients, alone or in combination, due to their capacity to prevent or retard the development of diabetes, and the strong relationship between metabolic syndrome and arterial hypertension, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of different antihypertensive drugs.",

Underprescription of these medicines, and failure to reach goals for blood pressure and urinary protein loss have contributed to this epidemic. Solutions to these problems require flexible analysis that contrasts with the more linear, rigid approaches recently popularized in various disease-management guidelines. The application of renin-angiotensin inhibitors, in an individualized goal-oriented manner sensitive to patient variations, is discussed. A similar approach to hypertension, emphasizing assessment of individual hemodynamic parameters, is proposed. The elimination of rigid limitations to increases in serum potassium and serum creatinine is suggested as a means to enhance prescription of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.",

Four characteristics were deemed relevant for the determination of first-line antihypertensive drug class: effectiveness, persistence with treatment as a measure of tolerability, cost, and clinical experience. Weight factors were determined by sending questionnaires to cardiologists, pharmacists, general practitioners (GPs), and internists in The Netherlands.

Giovanni Battista Hospital in Turin. We evaluated 16.055 patients among ED visits in a period of five months; the mean age was 59.6 +/- 20.2 year (range 17-93 y; 8.054 women and 8.001 men); 426 (2.6%) had ADRs, and 91 (21.4%) were admitted to the hospital. In multivariate analysis only the number of medicines was positive correlated with ADR. The drugs most frequently ADR-related were: anticoagulants (21.8%), antibiotics (17.6%), NSAIDs (9.9%), hypoglycaemic agents (9.6%), ACE-inhibitors (4.7%), antipyretics (4%) and alfa-litics (3.3%); the most common clinic events were: gastrointestinal bleeding (21.1%), rash (19.7%), confusion (23.9%), hypoglycaemia (8.4%), dyspnoea (7.0%), syncope and wheezing (5.6%), gastrointestinal bleeding (2.8%), anaemia (2.8%), haematomas (4.2%), vomiting (4.2%). Factor associated with increased ADR-hospital admission were increasing age (over 65 years old), gastrointestinal diseases, dementia and ADL-dependence. ADR-patients' Emergency Department mortality was higher than noADR-patients' one. The mean duration of hospitalization was higher in ADR-patients. It is necessary to reduce the number of drugs and improve studies and prevention strategies targeted to reduce the impact of ADR, specially in the elderly population.", 
    "543": "The renal impairment due to hypertension causes the disturbance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which is accompanied with increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors decreases the production of angiotensin II, secretion of aldosterone, sodium and water retention and peripheral vascular resistance which altogether lead to the reduction of blood pressure. The nephro-protective efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was also proved by plenty of extensive international trials both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with renal diseases. On evidence based medicine we may consider angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers--provided there are no contraindications as the standard therapy in all hypertensive and renal diseases.", 
    "544": "The deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Normally, the accumulation of beta-amyloid is prevented in part by the activities of several degradative enzymes, including the endothelin-converting enzymes, neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme, and plasmin. Recent reports indicate that another metalloprotease, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), can degrade beta-amyloid in vitro and in cellular overexpression experiments. In addition, ACE gene variants are linked to AD risk in several populations. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme function as vasopeptidases and are the targets of drugs designed to treat cardiovascular disorders, and ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed. We investigated the potential physiological role of ACE in regulating endogenous brain beta-amyloid levels for two reasons: first, to determine whether beta-amyloid degradation might be the mechanism by which ACE is associated with AD, and second, to determine whether ACE inhibitor drugs might block beta-amyloid degradation in the brain and potentially increase the risk for AD. We analyzed beta-amyloid accumulation in brains from ACE-deficient mice and in mice treated with ACE inhibitors and found that ACE deficiency did not alter steady-state beta-amyloid concentration. In contrast, beta-amyloid levels are significantly elevated in endothelin-converting enzyme and neprilysin knock-out mice, and inhibitors of these enzymes cause a rapid increase in beta-amyloid concentration in the brain. The results of these studies do not support a physiological role for ACE in the degradation of beta-amyloid in the brain but confirm roles for endothelin-converting enzyme and neprilysin and indicate that reductions in these enzymes result in additive increases in brain amyloid beta-peptide levels.", 
    "545": "This study was undertaken to compare and verify the antihypertensive effects of various delapril doses versus placebo on office and ambulatory blood pressure (BP). After a 2-wk placebo period, 303 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomized in a double-blind study to 8 wk of treatment with placebo, or delapril 7.5 mg twice daily, delapril 15 mg twice daily, delapril 30 mg twice daily, or delapril 30 mg once daily. BP changes versus baseline and rates of normalized office systolic blood pressure (SBP) <140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <90 mm Hg, as well as responder office SBP <140 mm Hg or reduction > or = 20 mm Hg and office DBP <90 mm Hg or reduction > or = 10 mm Hg, were calculated. In the intention-to-treat population (n=296), office SBP and DBP reductions were more notable with 30 mg twice daily (15.6/11.5 mm Hg) and 15 mg twice daily (14.8/12.5 mm Hg) than with other delapril regimens (30 mg once daily: 11.8/10.5 mm Hg; 7.5 mg twice daily: 12.9/10.1 mm Hg) and placebo (P<.05 for DBP; P<.01 for SBP). The same was true for frequency of responders (63.8% and 60.3%; P< or =.05 vs placebo) and normalized patients (58.6% and 53.4%; P<.05 vs placebo). Analysis of ambulatory BPs confirmed the accuracy of office BPs. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 3.4% to 6.7% of patients given delapril and in 6.5% of those given placebo. The lowest effective dose of delapril, 15 mg twice daily, may be recommended as the initial dose for patients who begin treatment with this agent.",

Although EPO was significantly higher in anaemic patients compared with non-anaemic patients, the EPO response was inappropriate for the degree of anaemia. Of patients with PSN, 66.7% had low EPO but there was no significant difference in EPO between patients with and without PSN. Log EPO correlated significantly with urine microalbumin:creatinine ratio and logistic regression analysis showed that haemoglobin, age and urine microalbumin: creatinine ratio were the main determinants of EPO.",

In favour of the preferred use of angiotensin receptor antagonists stand their excellent tolerance and the possible therapeutic escape seen with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. For the preferential use of the latter, the arguments are the absence of a real proof of any superiority of the angiotensin receptor blockers and their higher cost. The wisdom is to initially use angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in secondary prevention excepted when they are not well tolerated. The large ONTARGET cardiovascular prevention trial should help solve this controversy.",

Participation of CGRP in hypertension and related diseases, such as preeclampsia or vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrage, is one of the most studied topics. In this review we summarize the published roles of CGRP in pathophysiology of hypertension in humans and in experimental models. We also discuss the effects of direct administration of CGRP in the treatment of hypertension and of anti-hypertensive drugs that enhance the release or response of endogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, selective antagonists for the angiotensin II receptor, beta-blockers, magnesium sulphate for preeclampsia and rutaecarpine, as well as the possibilities using CGRP in gene therapy for prevention of vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrage.",

The aim of our study was to analyze the effects of the addition of AT1B to ACEi-based renoprotection in children with chronic kidney disease. We examined 11 children with a mean age of 10.5 years (range, 0.5-18 years) with a mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 61+/-61 ml/min/1.73 m(2). In four patients, the primary renal disease was hemolytic uremic syndrome, in three congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS), in two reflux nephropathy, prune-belly syndrome in one and acute cortical necrosis in one. All patients were treated with complex hypotensive ACEi-based therapy. AT1B losartan was added in a mean dose of 0.9 mg/kg/day. The change in GFR, proteinuria and blood pressure at two 12-month intervals before and after adding AT1B was compared. The results showed that during the 12 months preceding AT1B therapy, there was no change in blood pressure and proteinuria, but the GFR declined in 7 of 11 patients. After the 12th month of add-on therapy with AT1B, there was a significant decrease in both absolute and indexed blood pressure values. Proteinuria decreased in eight patients, did not change in one and increased in two, including one with CNS. The GFR stabilized or increased in eight patients and decreased in three patients with CNS. In 7 of 11 patients, there was a significant, but not threatening increase in serum potassium. In conclusion, add-on renoprotection with AT1B added to ACEi is safe and significantly improves the renoprotective effects of ACEi treatment in children with progressive nephropathies, including patients with advanced CKD.", 
    "560": "We report a patient with homozygous factor H deficiency leading to permanent alternate complement activation and early onset of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. He was successfully treated with weekly infusions of fresh frozen plasma over 4 years, displaying normal blood pressure while only treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a steady level of haptoglobin, low-range proteinuria and normal creatinine clearance. By the end of the fourth year of treatment, he dramatically developed a relapse of hemolytic and uremic syndrome, displaying undetectable haptoglobin, nephrotic range proteinuria and progressive renal failure. Despite a ten-fold increase in the dosage of plasma infusion through daily plasma exchange, haptoglobin remained undetectable while circulating antigenic factor H levels reached 22-24% (normal values 65-140%). Three months following the biological onset of the relapse, a bilateral nephrectomy was performed owing to uncontrolled hypertension and rapidly progressive renal failure. The molecular mechanism of plasma resistance remained unclear while antifactor H antibodies were not detected in the plasma. We suggest that protracted administration of exogenous factor H might not be a long-term strategy in homozygous factor H deficiency.",

Sham-operated rats were used as controls. Coronary artery ligation caused myocardial infarction, hypertrophy, and dysfunction 8 weeks after surgery. At week 1, circulating Ang II and Ang-(1-9) levels as well as left ventricular and plasma ACE and ACE2 activities increased in myocardial-infarcted rats as compared with controls. At 8 weeks post-myocardial infarction, circulating ACE activity, ACE mRNA levels, and Ang II levels remained higher, but plasma and left ventricular ACE2 activities and mRNA levels and circulating levels of Ang-(1-9) were lower than in controls. No changes in plasma Ang-(1-7) levels were observed at any time. Enalapril prevented cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction as well as the changes in left ventricular ACE, left ventricular and plasmatic ACE2, and circulating levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-9) after 8 weeks postinfarction. Thus, the decrease in ACE2 expression and activity and circulating Ang-(1-9) levels in late ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction were prevented with enalapril. These findings suggest that in this second arm of the renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may act through Ang-(1-9), rather than Ang-(1-7), as a counterregulator of the first arm, where ACE catalyzes the formation of Ang II.", 
    "562": "The venom from Australian elapid snakes contains a complex mixture of polypeptide toxins that adversely affect multiple homeostatic systems within their prey in a highly specific and targeted manner. Included in these toxin families are the recently described venom natriuretic peptides, which display similar structure and vasoactive functions to mammalian natriuretic peptides. This paper describes the identification and detailed comparative analysis of the cDNA transcripts coding for the mature natriuretic peptide from a total of nine Australian elapid snake species. Multiple isoforms were identified in a number of species and represent the first description of a natriuretic peptide from the venom gland for most of these snakes. Two distinct natriuretic peptide isoforms were selected from the common brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis), PtNP-a, and the mulga (Pseudechis australis), PaNP-c, for recombinant protein expression and functional analysis. Only one of these peptides, PtNP-a, displayed cGMP stimulation indicative of normal natriuretic peptide activity. Interestingly, both recombinant peptides demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, which is predictive of the vasoactive effects of the toxin. The natriuretic peptides, however, did not possess any coagulopathic activity, nor did they inhibit or potentiate thrombin, adenosine diphosphate or arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation. The data presented in this study represent a significant resource for understanding the role of various natriuretic peptides isoforms during the envenomation process by Australian elapid snakes.",

Rates of prothrombin and factor V activation (FVa), fibrinogen (Fbg) cleavage and FVa inactivation showed that both quinapril and atorvastatin decreased the rates of: formation of thrombin B-chain (by 30.6%, P=0.007; and by 34.3%, P=0.003), formation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes (by 30.4%, P=0.0002; and by 40%, P=0.001), FV activation (by 19.1%, P=0.03; and by 21.8%, P=0.005) and Fbg depletion (by 29.2%, P=0.004; and by 32.7%, P=0.001).

Addition of atorvastatin to quinapril, but not quinapril to the statin, enhanced the anticoagulant effects.

    "566": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-related angioedema is a well documented condition, which seems to occur in up to 1% of treated patients. It represents a problem for both the clinician and the patient: for the clinician, the diagnosis may be difficult due to its peculiar clinical characteristics, whereas for the misdiagnosed patient the delay prolongs a potentially dangerous situation. If the drug is not discontinued, the attacks tend to become worse and even life-threatening. There are now evidences that increased levels of bradykinin have an important role in the pathophysiology of attacks and, moreover, there are genetic factors that render certain individuals susceptible to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-related angioedema. In this review, the authors analyse the pathogenetic mechanism, the clinical presentation, the management and future perspectives of research on this condition.", 
    "567": "Angiotensin (Ang) II plays important roles in the development of hypertension and cardiovascular and renal injury. Pharmaceutical approaches to block its activity led to the development of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Numerous trials have documented their efficacy in controlling blood pressure, minimising left ventricular remodelling, preventing progression to heart failure, ameliorating proteinuria and retarding renal disease progression. Although they are considered safe in general, there remain concerns about the potential for adverse events in certain target populations. Recently, several novel, low molecular weight renin inhibitors without the extended peptide-like backbone of previous renin inhibitors were developed with favourable pharmacokinetic properties. They have been shown to successfully reduce Ang II levels in normal volunteers and to lower blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. In this review, the authors summarise current knowledge about these renin inhibitors.",

From this group the most special attention was attracted to peridopril-esbumin. High efficiency of this preparation has been corroborated by numerous controlled, multicentral investigations. Study of the effect of dosage and peculiarities of peridopril appears to be the most important taking into account age factor that has been insufficiently studied. The goal of our investigation was to study effect of 4 mg and 8 mg of peridopril on functional indices of the heart of patients with hypertonic disease and their psychoemotional sphere in the aspect of age. Total of 78 patients with hypertension and without clinical manifestations of cardiac insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and having had myocardial infarction were examined. According to the age patients were divided into two groups: <65 and >65. The investigations lasted for 12 months. Besides ECG investigations, patients were subjected to echoscopic and doplerographic investigations. For the estimation of life quality a questionnaire of evaluation of general health state (SF-36 Health Status Surveu) containing 11 questions was used. It was shown that peridopril has the different action among patients of different age groups. In older patients (>65 years) it increases indices of physical activity, while in younger patients it has a beneficial effect on the emotional parameters.", 
    "569": "Early clinical studies investigating the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure unexpectedly demonstrated a possible reduction in coronary heart disease endpoints. Two large scale clinical trials, HOPE and EUROPA, both studies in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) but without clinical evidence of heart failure, showed a highly significant improvement in coronary heart disease outcomes on treatment with ramipril and perindopril, respectively, in contrast, in a similar population, PEACE was unable to demonstrate such benefit with trandolapril. Meta-analyses of all trials involving ACE-inhibitors showed a highly significant improvement in coronary heart disease endpoints. Current ESC guidelines recommend ACE-inhibitor therapy in CAD patients with co-existing indications for ACE-inhibitors, such as hypertension, heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, prior MI was left ventricular dysfunction, or diabetes (class I, level of evidence A). These guidelines also recommend ACE-inhibitor therapy in all patients with angina and proven coronary disease (class IIa, level of evidence B). However, in angina patients without independent indication for ACE-inhibitor treatment, the anticipated benefit should be weighted against the costs and risks of side effects; in these patients, only agents and doses of proven efficacy for secondary prevention should be employed.",

As an attempt to describe the transcriptional activity of the venom gland, ESTs of a cDNA library constructed from B. jararaca venom gland were generated and submitted to bioinformatics analysis. The results showed a clear predominance of transcripts coding for toxins instead of transcripts coding for proteins involved in cellular functions. Among toxins, the most frequent transcripts were from metalloproteinases (52.6%), followed by serine-proteinases (28.5%), C-type lectins (8.3%) and bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) (6.2%). Results were similar to that obtained from the transcriptome analysis of B. insularis, a phylogenetically close sister of B. jararaca, though some differences were observed and are pointed out, such as a higher amount of the hypotensive BPPs in B. insularis transcriptome (19.7%). Another striking difference observed is that PIII and PII-classes of metalloproteinases are similarly represented in B. jararaca in contrast to B. insularis, in which a predominance of PIII-class metalloproteinase, which present a more intense hemorrhagic action, is observed. These features may, in part, explain the higher potency of B. insularis venom. The results obtained can help in proteome studies, and the clones can be used to directly probe the genetic material from other snake species or to investigate differences in gene expression pattern in response to factors such as diet, aging and geographic localization.", 
    "571": "Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Three large trials have assessed the effect of ACE inhibitors in stable patients without these conditions but with atherosclerosis. We undertook a systematic review of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE), the European trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril among patients with stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA), and the Prevention of Events with ACE inhibition (PEACE) studies to determine the consistency with which ACE inhibitors reduce total mortality and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events.", 
    "572": "We computed cardiovascular outcomes and total mortality in the 29,805 patients of these three trials, randomly assigned an ACE inhibitor or placebo and followed up for a mean of about 4.5 years. The results were also analysed within the context of five large trials of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure or LVSD.", 
    "573": "When the findings of the HOPE, EUROPA, and PEACE trials were combined, ACE inhibitors significantly reduced all-cause mortality (7.8 vs 8.9%, p=0.0004), cardiovascular mortality (4.3 vs 5.2%, p=0.0002), non-fatal myocardial infarction (5.3 vs 6.4%, p=0.0001), all stroke (2.2 vs 2.8%, p=0.0004), heart failure (2.1 vs 2.7%, p=0.0007), coronary-artery bypass surgery (6.0 vs 6.9%, p=0.0036) but not percutaneous coronary intervention (7.4 vs 7.6%, p=0.481). The composite outcomes of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 1599 (10.7%) of the patients allocated ACE inhibitor and in 1910 (12.8%) of those allocated placebo (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CIs 0.76-0.88; p<0.0001). Except for stroke and revascularisation, these results were similar to those of the five trials in patients with heart failure or LVSD.",

Results showing these benefits in intermediate-risk patients complement existing evidence of similar benefit in higher-risk patients with LVSD or heart failure. Therefore, use of ACE inhibitors should be considered in all patients with atherosclerosis.", 
    "575": "Diastolic heart failure is a common form of congestive heart failure that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. In contrast to heart failure caused by systolic left ventricular dysfunction, diastolic heart failure is harder to diagnose and less likely to be accepted as a diagnosis. In addition, treatment strategies are much less defined than those for heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction.",

We report two cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome that developed ARF following captopril (an ACEI) treatment for prednisolone-induced hypertension. The two cases further alert us to the potential risk of ACEI-induced ARF in any nephrotic child on ACEI treatment. Low or high dose ACEIs should be given with extreme caution in active nephrotics in view of their relative hypovolemic state that may provoke ARF. The nephrotic children, who must be treated with ACEIs with or without diuretics, should be closely monitored for the development of ARF during the use of ACEIs.",

Here, we report a rare case of early onset nephrotic syndrome developing de novo in the 17th week of pregnancy. A renal biopsy was done and the specimens revealed typical features of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient had a progressive clinical course of disease despite steroid treatment. Suffering from severe intrauterine growth restriction, the fetus died in utero. After delivery, steroid treatment was continued. The patient had normal renal function with a decrease in proteinuria in the second and fifth month postpartum. This report points out the poor fetal prognosis associated with an early onset nephrotic syndrome. Pregnant patients with early onset nephrotic syndrome should be carefully evaluated for the presence of chronic renal disease, and primary renal pathology should be included in the differential diagnosis of massive proteinuria in early pregnancy.",

Of the 56 patients, 35 had a final diagnosis of essential burning mouth disorder (EBMD). Five patients with EBMD had a family history of diabetes and two had been diagnosed with late-onset diabetes. Other oral burning diagnoses included sialoadenitis (burning lips syndrome), irritation or allergic reactions to triclosan, diabetic neuropathy, subclinical oral candidiasis, nutritional deficiency/neuropathy, and a drug reaction to an ACE inhibitor (scalded mouth syndrome) that resulted in oral burning.",

Because of continuous proteinuria we performed a left renal biopsy which showed moderate mesangial hypercellularity. Her overt orthostatic proteinuria disappeared after a treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Nutcracker syndrome remains a rare but important cause of elevated protein excretion, which can induce mesangial changes and be improved by ACE inhibitor treatment.",

Despite their effectiveness, treatment with these drugs is characterized by chronic and acute side effects with variable expression depending on the clinical context. Angioedema occurs in patients with hypertension or heart failure. Anaphylactoid reaction is also reported in hemodialysis patients and severe hypotensive reaction in patients receiving transfused blood products and plasmapheresis. In this paper, we describe the role of kinins and metallopeptidases in the pathophysiology of these acute side effects. We also propose different experimental and clinical evidences which plead for an ecogenetic nature of these rare but life-threatening events.",

The effect of agents alone or combined was also evaluated at the time of overt proteinuria (late treatment, 52-61 weeks).", 
    "583": "When given early, 1D11 displayed marked antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects. Glomerulosclerosis was reduced to the extent that a remarkable percentage of glomeruli without sclerosis appeared after treatment. Podocyte number was normalized. Renoprotection of 1D11 was comparable to enalapril. Despite control of blood pressure, in late treatment single agents did not reduce proteinuria significantly. Glomerulosclerosis and podocyte loss were partially limited by 1D11 or enalapril, but full protection was achieved by combination.", 
    "584": "Renoprotective effect of TGFbeta antagonism crucially depends on the time at which treatment started. Effectiveness of early treatment with 1D11 would indicate that TGFbeta is a major mediator of damage in early diabetes. To tackle the renal damage in the phase of advanced disease, a combined treatment with ACE inhibitor is needed.", 
    "585": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common clinical problem, especially affecting the elderly. Current strategies of neurohormonal blockade with medications like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have improved morbidity and mortality, but further improvement in outcomes requires new strategies. Both anemia and chronic renal disease commonly accompany congestive heart failure; their close relationship, in which one disease exacerbates the other, has been termed the cardio-renal-anemia syndrome. Correction of anemia in CHF patients using recombinant erythropoietin is feasible; small studies suggest that anemic congestive heart failure patients may have improved morbidity with this therapy. Recent animal and human studies of erythropoietin have shown that its benefit may be derived from both hematological and newly discovered non-hematological properties. Anemia might soon be considered a modifiable risk factor for optimal CHF management.",

Prevalence of HF with a normal left ejection fraction increases with age and is higher in older women than older men. Both underlying and precipitating causes of HF should be treated when possible. Hypertension, especially isolated systolic hypertension, should be treated with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta blockers. Myocardial ischemia should be treated with nitrates and beta blockers. Anemia should be treated, as should hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and obstructive sleep apnea. Use of inappropriate drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, should be avoided.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 up-regulates the cellular renin-angiotensin system, resulting in ANG II synthesis, which activates p53 creating a positive feedback loop. One hundred and fourteen rabbits were separated into groups A (control), B (sham-operated), C and D. In groups C and D, an aortic stenosis was performed, and in group D the animals were treated with enalapril. For p53 determination, LV specimens were examined by Western blot analysis and an immunohistochemical study was performed, except for samples from group D. In conclusion, LVH was significantly induced at 7 and 28 days after aortic stenosis with no difference between the two periods, while enalapril prevented hypertrophy in these two groups. p53 was transcriptionally activated and immunoreactively present after acute pressure overload as well as in the sham-operated group. Enalapril decreased the p53 expression at 180 min, 7 and 28 days following aortic stenosis.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cardiovascular diseases and their concomitant medications use on the incidence of ED. The target population consisted of men aged 55, 65 or 75 years old residing in the study area in Finland in 1999. Questionnaires were mailed to 2837 men in 1999 and to 2510 of them 5 years later. The follow-up sample consisted of 1665 men (66% of those eligible) who responded to both baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Men free of moderate or severe ED at baseline (N=1000) were included in the study. ED was assessed by two questions on subject ability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for intercourse. Poisson regression model was used in the multivariable analyses. The risk of ED was higher in men suffering from treated hypertension or heart disease than in those with the untreated condition. The risk of ED was higher in men using calcium channel inhibitor (adjusted relative risk (RR)=1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-2.4), angiotensin II antagonist (RR=2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.7), non-selective beta-blocker (RR=1.7, 95% CI 0.9-3.2) or diuretic (RR=1.3, CI 0.7-2.4) compared with non-users. ED was not associated with using organic nitrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, selective beta-blockers and serum lipid-lowering agents. In summary, calcium channel inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, non-selective beta-blockers and diuretics may increase the risk of ED.",

Antiarrhythmic medications have not demonstrated a survival benefit. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have been revalidated in recent studies to improve survival and reduce risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with myocardial infarction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists should also be used in these patients. Data from randomized trials demonstrate significant survival benefit with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and indications have expanded. Patients with established ischemic cardiomyopathy do not require electrophysiologic studies for induction of tachyarrhythmias based on these trials.

    "603": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with an elevated polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count and a PMN rheological impairment. In this study we evaluated two major rheological aspects (membrane fluidity and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration) in a group of young adults with AMI. We enrolled 41 AMI patients (39 men and 2 women; mean age 41.0 +/- 4.0 years), who were examined 5-10 days after AMI (T1) and 12 months later (T2). The membrane fluidity was obtained labelling granulocytes with the fluorescent probe 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) and considering the degree of fluorescence polarization, inversely correlated to the membrane lipid fluidity. The cytosolic Ca2+ content was obtained marking PMN cells with the fluorescent probe Fura-2AM and considering the ratio between the Fura 2-Ca2+ complex and the unchelated Fura 2 fluorescence intensity. Both parameters were evaluated at baseline and after in vitro activation with 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at the concentration of 4.5 muM, prolonged for 5 and 15 minutes. At T1 the PMN membrane fluidity and cytosolic Ca2+ content in AMI patients were respectively decreased and increased in comparison with control group. At T2 the membrane fluidity was not any more different from control subjects, but there was also a further increase in cytosolic Ca2+ content. In vitro, PMN activation caused no significant variation of these parameters in the control group, while in AMI patients membrane fluidity significantly decreased and cytosolic Ca2+ content increased not only during the initial stage, but also after 12 months. The long-term functional alteration of PMN cells observed in young adults with AMI confirms the role of these cells in the inflammatory response following AMI. In the light of these data, the use of molecules able to modulate granulocyte activity, such as calcium channel blockers or pentoxifylline, should be reconsidered in myocardial infarction, together with the usual pharmacological treatment.", 
    "604": "The rheologic characteristics of blood and its formed elements continue to be of basic science and clinical interest, with numerous publications dealing with topics such as blood and plasma viscosity, RBC aggregation and cell deformability. Alterations of blood's rheologic behavior in pathologic states have been extensively studied, with the findings usually indicating changes assumed to be detrimental to tissue perfusion (e.g., increased RBC aggregation). However, the current literature contains relatively few studies dealing with two important areas: (1) relations between altered rheologic behavior and in vivo hemodynamics; (2) the effects of therapy in those clinical states associated with altered rheologic behavior. This paper presents brief and selective comments on the assumed importance of two rheologic \"abnormalities\" (i.e., increased plasma viscosity, increased RBC aggregation), and on whether clinical therapy in diabetes, hypertension and sepsis leads to normalization of the \"abnormalities\". Finally, a few gratuitous comments are presented regarding possible future directions in the field of hemorheology and hemodynamics.", 
    "605": "Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 +/- 2.5 and 157 +/- 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 +/- 5.8, DBP = 38.8 +/- 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 +/- 8.2, DBP = 29.5 +/- 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 +/- 3.7, DBP = 8.7 +/- 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 +/- 4.1, DBP = 9.4 +/- 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 +/- 5.8, DBP = 21.64 +/- 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 +/- 2.74, DBP = 9.19 +/- 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.", 
    "606": "The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities of peptides in water-soluble extracts, obtained from raw and sterilized ovine and caprine cheeselike systems coagulated with enzymes from the plant Cynara cardunculus, were assessed. Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from beta-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from alpha(s1)-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity.

    "607": "The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize new inhibitory peptides of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) from goat milk and to analyze the effect of long-term intake of a goat milk hydrolysate-supplemented (GP-hyd) diet on the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Three new inhibitory peptides for ACE (TGPIPN, SLPQ, and SQPK) were isolated. The inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values of individual peptides were 316, 330, and 354 micromol/L, respectively. Only TGPIPN was found to pass intact a monolayer of Caco-2 cells in small amounts. The SHR fed for 12 wk a diet (GP-hyd) enriched in a hydrolysate containing these peptides (estimated intake of TGPIPN was 230 mg/kg per d) showed lower (approximately 15 mmHg) systolic blood pressure than animals fed a control diet. The ACE activities in the aorta, left ventricle, and kidney were significantly decreased in the GP-hyd group compared with those of the control group and were similar to those found in SHR fed captopril (130 mg/kg per d). Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine by aortic rings from SHR was improved in those fed the GP-hyd diet. The left ventricle weight and kidney weight index were significantly reduced in the GP-hyd group and captopril groups. Moreover, long-term treatment of SHR with a diet enriched in goat milk hydrolysate, or captopril, attenuated the development of hypertension, cardiac and renal hypertrophy, and endothelial dysfunction. These effects might be related to the in vivo inhibitory effects of the hydrolysate on tissue ACE activity.", 
    "608": "Omapatrilat (OMA), a vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI), presently being tested in clinical trials for its antihypertensive properties, inhibits both angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, and raises tissue bradykinin levels. Recent studies from our laboratory and those of others have demonstrated that VPIs enhance muscle glucose uptake in animal models, and this effect is mediated by the bradykinin-nitric oxide pathway. The mechanism of the effect of OMA on muscle glucose uptake, however, is presently unknown. To investigate the effect of OMA on insulin signaling, soleus muscle was isolated 2 or 5 min after an i.v. bolus of insulin or saline from male Zucker fatty rats (8-10 weeks of age), following a 5-day treatment period of oral OMA (15 mg/kg per day) or drug vehicle (placebo). OMA resulted in significantly lower systolic blood pressure compared with the placebo-treated group (84.4+/- 7.52 mmHg in OMA vs 112+/-2.18 mmHg in controls, P<0.01). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) revealed no changes in protein mass with OMA treatment. OMA did not enhance basal or insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation or its subsequent association with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, OMA treatment did not alter the protein mass or the phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B, p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase or adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, or GLUT4 protein expression. We conclude that the ability of OMA to enhance whole body and specifically muscle glucose uptake in Zucker fatty rats is not mediated by enhancing insulin or AMPK signaling. Future studies should examine whether hemodynamic effects of the drug, independent of insulin signaling, enhance glucose uptake in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle.", 
    "609": "Previous studies by our group have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the developing kidney modulates transforming growth factor-beta receptors. Blocking of angiotensin II (ANG II) mainly through angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) has been implicated in mediating this ACE inhibition. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of an AT1 antagonist, losartan, on transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), TGF-beta receptor I [TbetaRI, activin-like kinase (ALK)-1, ALK-5], TGF-beta receptor II (TbetaRII), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression in the developing kidney. Newborn rat pups were treated with losartan (30 mg/kg per day) or normal saline for 7 days. Kidneys were removed for immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Western blotting of TGF-beta1, ALK-1, ALK-5, TbetaRII, and alpha-SMA. Renal ALK-5 and TbetaRII protein expressions in the losartan-treated group were found to be significantly increased (P<0.05), whereas TGF-beta1, ALK-1, and alpha-SMA protein expressions were not changed by losartan treatment. The losartan-treated group also showed significantly increased mean tubular diameter and interstitial area of the kidney (P<0.05). These results suggest that AT1 inhibition in the developing kidney impairs renal growth and development and modulates the expression of ALK-5 and TbetaRII.", 
    "610": "Obesity-induced hypertension and essential hypertension in lean patients are two different forms of hypertension. The main goal of this study was to test whether there are differences in biochemical parameters between subjects with obesity-associated hypertension and those with essential hypertension. We examined whether the biochemical responses to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) ramipril therapy reveal properties of these two conditions that might explain the differences in clinical outcome. Before ramipril therapy, the hypertensive group exhibited increases in ACE activity (p<0.05), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the malondialdehyde/nitric oxide end-product ratio (MDA/NO(x)) (p<0.05), and decreases in xanthine oxidase (XO) activity (p<0.05) and plasma nitric oxide end-product (NO(x)) level (p<0.01). Before medication, plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1), plasma leptin, and leptin receptor levels were normal. Following ramipril treatment, ACE activity normalized. Before ACE inhibitor treatment, the obese-hypertensive group exhibited elevated levels of plasma ET-1 (p<0.05), plasma leptin (p<0.01), XO activity (p<0.05), plasma MDA and MDA/NO(x) (p<0.05), and reduced levels of plasma NO(x)(p<0.01) and leptin receptors (p<0.001). Following medication, the plasma NO(x) level, MDA/NO(x), and XO activity returned to normal while ACE activity decreased (p<0.001). In patients with essential hypertension, NO availability and ACE activity, and in those with obesity-associated hypertension, hyperleptinemic effects, NO level, endothelin-1 concentration and XO activity, may be important factors in the pathology.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in arterial distensibility using antihypertensive drugs. This treatment focused on the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the changes produced in blood pressure. Measurements were taken at baseline and throughout 60 months in 66 previously untreated hypertensive patients (22 men and 44 women, aged 54 +/- 9.5 years, range 38-73 years at baseline). All patients received either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or, in case of adverse effects, angiotensin receptor blockers. To control blood pressure, diuretics, calcium channel blocking agents, or beta blockers were added when appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed by means of ANOVA with alpha = 0.05. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased during the first year without significant changes thereafter. There were no significant changes in pulse pressure. Pulse wave velocity showed a continuous and significant decrease throughout the follow-up period, but its reduction since the third year was more evident than the decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.0001 for both). This observation could be related to changes in arterial remodeling probably due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or renin angiotensin system blockade. Further investigations are needed to establish this relationship.", 
    "612": "Despite the evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the influence of ACE2 on angiotensin metabolism within the kidney is not well known, particularly in experimental models other than rats or mice. Therefore, we investigated the metabolism of the angiotensins in isolated proximal tubules, urine, and serum from sheep. Radiolabeled [(125)I]ANG I was hydrolyzed primarily to ANG II and ANG-(1-7) by ACE and neprilysin, respectively, in sheep proximal tubules. The ACE2 product ANG-(1-9) from ANG I was not detected in the absence or presence of ACE and neprilysin inhibition. In contrast, the proximal tubules contained robust ACE2 activity that converted ANG II to ANG-(1-7). Immunoblots utilizing an NH(2) terminal-directed ACE2 antibody revealed a single 120-kDa band in proximal tubule membranes. ANG-(1-7) was not a stable product in the tubule preparation and was rapidly hydrolyzed to ANG-(1-5) and ANG-(1-4) by ACE and neprilysin, respectively. Comparison of activities in the proximal tubules with nonsaturating concentrations of substrate revealed equivalent activities for ACE (ANG I to ANG II: 248 +/- 17 fmol x mg(-1) x min(-1)) and ACE2 [ANG II to ANG-(1-7): 253 +/- 11 fmol x mg(-1) x min(-1)], but lower neprilysin activity [ANG II to ANG-(1-4): 119 +/- 24 fmol x mg(-1) x min(-1); P < 0.05 vs. ACE or ACE2]. Urinary metabolism of ANG I and ANG II was similar to the proximal tubules; soluble ACE2 activity was also detectable in sheep serum. In conclusion, sheep tissues contain abundant ACE2 activity that converts ANG II to ANG-(1-7) but does not participate in the processing of ANG I into ANG-(1-9).", 
    "613": "Kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) is associated with ischemic and proteinuric tubular injury; however, whether dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can also induce Kim-1 is unknown. We studied Kim-1 expression in homozygous Ren2 rats, characterized by renal damage through excessive RAS activation. We also investigated whether antifibrotic treatment (RAS blockade or p38 MAP kinase inhibition) would affect Kim-1 expression. At 7 wk of age, homozygous Ren2 rats received a nonhypotensive dose of candesartan (0.05 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) sc) or the p38 inhibitor SB-239063 (15 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) sc) for 4 wk; untreated Ren2 and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats served as controls. Kim-1 mRNA and protein expression were determined by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, and related to markers of prefibrotic renal damage. Urinary Kim-1 was measured in 8-wk-old Ren2 and SD rats with and without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ramipril, 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) in drinking water for 4 wk). Untreated Ren2 rats showed a >20-fold increase in renal Kim-1 mRNA (expressed as Kim-1-to-GAPDH ratio): 75.5 +/- 43.6 vs. 3.1 +/- 1.0 in SD rats (P < 0.01). Candesartan and SB-239063 strongly reduced Kim-1 mRNA: 3.1 +/- 1.5 (P < 0.01) and 9.8 +/- 4.2 (P < 0.05), respectively. Kim-1 protein expression in damaged tubules paralleled mRNA expression. Kim-1 expression correlated with renal osteopontin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and collagen III expression and with tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Damaged tubular segments expressing activated p38 also expressed Kim-1. Urinary Kim-1 was increased in Ren2 vs. SD (458 +/- 70 vs. 27 +/- 2 pg/ml, P < 0.01) rats and abolished in Ren2 rats treated with ramipril (33 +/- 5 pg/ml, P < 0.01). Kim-1 is associated with development of RAS-mediated renal damage. Antifibrotic treatment through RAS blockade or p38 MAP kinase inhibition reduced Kim-1 in the homozygous Ren2 model.",

    "619": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are frequently associated. Cardiovascular morbidity is a major burden in these patients. Furthermore a renal disease appears in 40% of them that may lead to chronic terminal renal failure. Whatever the stage of the renal disease, it increases the cardiovascular risk. A majority of type 2 diabetic patients will eventually died of cardiovascular complications before having reached chronic terminal renal failure. Many large clinical trials including type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension have been performed in the last 20 years with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as primary outcomes. These trials mainly evaluated the role of glycemic control, of hypertension as well as the decrease of LDL-cholesterol. Based on these trials, the prescription type of hypertensive type 2 diabetic patient should include, besides hygienic and dietary advices, antidiabetic treatment, thiazide and/or betablocker and platelet inhibitor. Statin should be prescribed for secondary prevention if serum LDL-cholesterol is above 1,3 g/l and for primary prevention depending on serum LDL-cholesterol and on the number of cardiovascular risk factors. The objectives are an HbA1c below 6,5%, a LDL-cholesterol below 1g/l and a blood pressure below 150/80 mmHg. The appearance of diabetic nephropathy alters the treatment and the therapeutic objectives. Many large trials aimed at preventing microalbuminuria (primary prevention), macroproteinuria (secondary prevention), and chronic renal failure (tertiary prevention) have been conducted. For primary prevention, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors should be prescribed in case of hypertension because they delay the appearance of microalbuminuria. For secondary prevention, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers decrease albuminuria excretion rate and delay the appearance of macroproteinuria whatever the blood pressure. Tertiary prevention is based on angiotensin-receptor blockers since they slow down the decrease of renal function. The objectives are a blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg and the regression or the reduction of albuminuria excretion rate. Intensified and target-driven interventions aimed at multiple risk factors implicated in cardiovascular and renal lesions, as successfully performed in the STENO-2 study, reduce the risk of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. In this article, large clinical trials having the prevention of cardiovascular and renal risks as primary outcomes were analyzed.", 
    "620": "1. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of hypotensive therapy with a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) on selected oxidative stress parameters in the blood of elderly patients with essential hypertension. 2. Studies were performed in 45 elderly patients with essential hypertension at baseline and after the 45th day of perindopril (n = 25) or hydrochlorothiazide (n = 20) therapy, as well as in 25 young and 25 elderly normotensive subjects. The following parameters were measured: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, nitric oxide (NO), carbonyl groups and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, as well as the activity of ceruloplasmin (Cp) oxidase, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) and catalase (CAT). 3. The activity of SOD-1 and NO levels were reduced with age. 4. Compared with elderly controls, hypertensive subjects showed increases in baseline MDA, carbonyl group concentrations and Cp oxidase activity and decreases in NO levels and SOD-1 and CAT activities. 5. Treatment with perindopril, but not hydrochlorothiazide, resulted in significant increases in SOD-1 and CAT activities and decreases in MDA concentration and Cp oxidase activity. Both therapies decreased the level of carbonyl groups and increased NO levels. 6. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy has significant anti-oxidant effects that may be important in the treatment of elderly patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "621": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) exists as two isoforms: somatic ACE (sACE), comprised of two homologous N and C domains, and testis ACE (tACE), comprised of the C domain only. The N and C domains are both active, but show differences in substrate and inhibitor specificity. While both isoforms are shed from the cell surface via a sheddase-mediated cleavage, tACE is shed much more efficiently than sACE. To delineate the regions of tACE that are important in catalytic activity, intracellular processing, and regulated ectodomain shedding, regions of the tACE sequence were replaced with the corresponding N-domain sequence. The resultant chimeras C1-163Ndom-ACE, C417-579Ndom-ACE, and C583-623Ndom-ACE were processed to the cell surface of transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and were cleaved at the identical site as that of tACE. They also showed acquisition of N-domain-like catalytic properties. Homology modelling of the chimeric proteins revealed structural changes in regions required for tACE-specific catalytic activity. In contrast, C164-416Ndom-ACE and C191-214Ndom-ACE demonstrated defective intracellular processing and were neither enzymatically active nor shed. Therefore, critical elements within region D164-V416 and more specifically I191-T214 are required for the processing, cell-surface targeting, and enzyme activity of tACE, and cannot be substituted for by the homologous N-domain sequence.", 
    "622": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are viewed by many as important treatment options for both the management of hypertension and the provision of end-organ protection. ACE inhibitors have not been looked on as having any clearly recognizable direct pulmonary benefits; rather, their pulmonary effects have been felt to be a nuisance by virtue of their association with cough. ACE inhibitor-related cough is well characterized. What is less well appreciated is the relationship between sleep apnea, pneumonia, and ACE inhibitor-related cough. These new pulmonary observations in patients afflicted with an ACE inhibitor-related cough should revive interest in this bothersome side effect.", 
    "623": "Doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors used in the landmark heart failure trials that demonstrated survival benefit are rarely reached in routine practice. The authors review the current literature regarding optimal dosing of ACE inhibitors in heart failure with specific focus on neurohormonal, functional capacity, and clinical outcomes. Neurohormonal studies have shown that lower ACE inhibitor dosing may provide inadequate suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Higher doses of ACE inhibitors have resulted in greater increments in exercise and functional capacity. Clinically, patients on high-dose ACE inhibitor therapy had significant reductions in all-cause mortality or hospitalization, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and heart failure-specific hospitalizations. There is, however, conflicting evidence, and so continued uncertainty exists regarding optimal dosing. Despite underutilization of ACE inhibitors, there is insufficient evidence to support lower doses. Likewise, limited data exist for doses higher than those used in the landmark trials. Clinicians should therefore attempt to reach target doses in heart failure whenever possible.", 
    "624": "Identification and management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, is essential not only for prevention of cardiovascular disease, but also for slowing the progression of existing cardiovascular disease. A major underlying mechanism that links various cardiovascular risk factors and manifestations of cardiovascular disease is endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired nitric oxide bioactivity. Oxidative stress is an important cause of impaired nitric oxide bioactivity, and a major pathogenic mechanism of atherosclerosis. Several pharmacologic therapies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, statins, and the vasodilating beta blocker nebivolol, have been shown to enhance nitric oxide bioactivity and improve endothelial function. This effect may help explain the cardioprotective benefits of these agents and may stimulate further use of nitric oxide modulation for the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and manifestations of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "625": "Many diabetic hypertensives are inadequately managed because of the doctor's misplaced emphasis on possible differences in efficacy and risk profile of antihypertensive drugs. These patients are at higher risk of various cardiovascular events, and evidence shows they experience greater reduction in adverse clinical outcomes as a result of tight control of blood pressure than do nondiabetic hypertensives. It is, therefore, critically important that such patients be identified and that the blood pressure is tightly treated. Several drugs often have to be used in combination in order to achieve adequate blood pressure control. Nonpharmacologic measures, such as exercise, have been shown to reduce blood pressure and to reduce the rate complications in diabetic patients. All classes of antihypertensives have been shown to be equivalent in reducing all adverse cardiovascular events in diabetic hypertensives. Although there is nothing to choose between diuretics, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, the choice of drug should be tailored for the individual patient. Drug selection should be based on the complication that is most likely in the given patient. Available data suggests that the lower the blood pressure the better the prognoses, with no threshold of the lower limit of the ideal value. Many professional associations advise that a target blood pressure in the diabetic hypertensive under treatment should be below 130/80 mm Hg. There is no evidence to support the avoidance of thiazide diuretics in these patients, and indeed some patients derive specific benefits from the use of these drugs. Tight control of blood pressure is the overriding priority, and this takes precedence over the theoretical debate of which drug is the best choice or concern over possible adverse reactions.", 
    "626": "Inhibition of the metalloprotease ECE-1 may be beneficial for the treatment of coronary heart disease, cancer, renal failure, and urological disorders. A novel class of indole-based ECE inhibitors was identified by high throughput screening. Optimization of the original screening lead structure 6 led to highly potent inhibitors such as 11, which bears a bisaryl amide moiety linked to the indole C2 position through an amide group. Docking of 11 into a model structure of ECE revealed a unique binding mode in which the Zn center of the enzyme is not directly addressed by the inhibitor, but key interactions are suggested for the central amide group. Testing of the lead compound 6 in hypertensive Dahl S rats resulted in a decrease in blood pressure after an initial period in which the blood pressure remained unchanged, most probably the result of ET-1 already present. Indole derivative 6 also displays a cardio-protective effect in a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction after oral administration. The more potent chloropyridine derivative 9 antagonizes big-ET-1-induced increase in blood pressure in rats at intravenous administration of 3 mg kg-1. All ECE inhibitors of the indole class showed high selectivity for ECE over related metalloproteases such as NEP and ACE. Therefore, these compounds might have further potential as drugs for the treatment of coronary heart diseases.", 
    "627": "Essential fatty acids (EFAs), linoleic acid (LA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) are essential for humans, and are freely available in the diet. Hence, EFA deficiency is extremely rare in humans. To derive the full benefits of EFAs, they need to be metabolized to their respective long-chain metabolites, i.e., dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), and arachidonic acid (AA) from LA; and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from ALA. Some of these long-chain metabolites not only form precursors to respective prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), and leukotrienes (LTs), but also give rise to lipoxins (LXs) and resolvins that have potent anti-inflammatory actions. Furthermore, EFAs and their metabolites may function as endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme and 3-hdroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, nitric oxide (NO) enhancers, anti-hypertensives, and anti-atherosclerotic molecules. Recent studies revealed that EFAs react with NO to yield respective nitroalkene derivatives that exert cell-signaling actions via ligation and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The metabolism of EFAs is altered in several diseases such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Thus, EFAs and their derivatives have varied biological actions and seem to be involved in several physiological and pathological processes.", 
    "628": "We studied the effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, or a combination of benazepril/amlodipine or benazepril/HCTZ on systolic blood pressure (BP) and end-organ injury (left ventricular hypertrophy, proteinuria, and endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine) in hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed either a normal-salt (0.5% NaCl) or high-salt (4% NaCl) diet for 6 weeks. Rats fed a high-salt diet developed hypertension and significant end-organ injury. Monotherapy with HCTZ (75 mg/L in drinking water) or amlodipine (10 mg/kg/day by gavage) reduced systolic BP and proteinuria; benazepril (40 mg/kg/day by gavage) decreased proteinuria without significantly lowering systolic BP. In rats receiving a high-salt diet, only HCTZ reduced left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas endothelium-dependent relaxation was improved by amlodipine and benazepril but not by HCTZ. Combining benazepril with either amlodipine or HCTZ dramatically reduced systolic BP and end-organ injury. These data clearly support clinical studies suggesting that combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy for systolic BP control and prevention of end-organ injury. Complementary mechanisms of action of agents from different antihypertensive classes appear to facilitate the greater benefit on BP and end-organ injury.", 
    "629": "The development of nitrate tolerance has been found to be associated with vascular production of superoxide anion (O2-*), generated mainly by the eNOS and NADPH oxidase pathways. The aim of our study was to investigate whether long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by ramipril is able to protect against nitrate tolerance in the aortas of eNOS-deficient (eNOS-/-) mice and to assess the implication of the NADPH oxidase pathway. Therefore, 3 types of treatment were given to wild-type (WT) and eNOS-/- mice: group 1 received ramipril for 5 weeks and a co-treatment with ramirpil plus nitroglycerine (NTG) during the last 4 days, group 2 received only NTG, and group 3 served as control. Relaxations to NTG (0.1 nmol/L to 0.1 mmol/L) were determined on U44619, a thromboxane analogue, precontracted rings, and O2-* production were assessed on aorta homogenates with the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence technique. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate and reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed on whole mouse aortas. In WT group 2, the concentration-effect curves to NTG were significantly shifted to the right: the pD2 was 6.16 +/- 0.17 (n = 6) vs 6.81 +/- 0.10 (n = 6) in WT group 3 (not exposed to NTG; P < 0.05) and O2-* production was enhanced from 100% +/- 11% (n = 9) to 191% +/- 21% (n = 6; P < 0.01). In contrast, in WT group 1, the rightward shift was abolished: the pD2 value was 6.73 +/- 0.13 (n = 6; NS vs group 3 WT) and O2-* production was 117% +/- 6% (n = 7; NS vs group 3 WT). In eNOS groups 1 and 3, similar data were observed: the pD2 values were 7.58 +/- 0.08 and 7.38 +/- 0.11 (NS) vs 6.89 +/- 0.20 in eNOS group 2 (n = 6; P < 0.01). In the WT mice aortas, ramipril treatment significantly increased the cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels (reflecting nitric oxide availability), which returned to control values after in vivo co-treatment with a bradykinin BK2 antagonist (Icatibant). In both strains, candesartan, an AT1 blocker, was also able to protect against the development of nitrate tolerance. Moreover, before NTG exposure, ramipril treatment decreased p22phox and gp91phox (essential NADPH oxidase subunits) mRNA expression in aortas from both mice strains. In conclusion, long-term ramipril treatment in mice protects against the development of nitrate tolerance by counteracting NTG-induced increase in O2 production, which involves a direct interaction with the NADPH oxidase pathway and seems to be completely independent of the eNOS pathway.", 
    "630": "The Valsartan-Heart Failure trial formulated the hypothesis that combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers with an angiotensin-receptor blocker had a deleterious interaction. Furthermore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved heart failure indication for valsartan included the statement that concomitant use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-blocker was not recommended. The Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM)-Added and the VALsartan In Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT) provide reassuring evidence to support concomitant use of angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers. The FDA-approved heart failure indication for candesartan included the statement of additive benefits with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers and led to a change in the valsartan label. These considerations have great clinical and public health importance given the increasing numbers of patients with heart failure, their high morbidity and mortality, and the relatively limited number of effective drug therapies.", 
    "631": "The incidence of resistant hypertension, the failure to reduce blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg, despite the use of 3 antihypertensive medications at optimal doses including a diuretic, is estimated to be less than 5% of the hypertensive population. Resistant hypertension increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and renal failure. Evaluation of the patient with resistant hypertension should include 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home measurements and a limited search for secondary causes. Treatment should focus on optimizing the drug regimen in a logical way, based on the patient's comorbidities and tolerability. Long-acting, well-tolerated once-daily medications are preferred, and the regimen should include in sequence a diuretic, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor-blocker inhibitors, and a calcium-channel blocker. This article reviews the definitions and causes and provides specific recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with this life-threatening condition.",

Four-week-old streptozotocin induced spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were randomized for no treatment, or for treatment with captopril, losartan or triple therapy (hydrochlorothiazide, reserpine and hydralazine) for 20 days. Increase in systolic blood pressure was equally prevented by captopril (118+/-15 mmHg), losartan (111+/-9) and triple therapy (112+/-14, p<0.0001). Glomerular size was higher (p<0.005) in diabetic SHR (27,300+/-2130 microm(2)) compared with non-diabetic SHR (23,800+/-307). The antihypertensive therapy with captopril (23,900+/-175), losartan (23,800+/-120), and triple therapy (23,400+/-210) prevented the glomerular enlargement in diabetic SHR. Glomerular expression of fibronectin was increased in diabetic SHR (7.61+/-1.22 densitometric unit) as compared to the controls (2.27+/-2.15, p<0.0001), and was decreased (p<0.0001 vs diabetic SHR) with captopril (2.49+/-1.42), losartan (1.57+/-1.1) and triple therapy (2.04+/-1.42). The number of replicating glomerular cell significantly decreased in diabetic SHR and it was restored by all three antihypertensive regimes. The glomerular expression of p27(Kip1) was increased in diabetic SHR but it was not modified by antihypertensive treatment. Strict blood pressure control, in diabetic SHR independently of the class of antihypertensive agent, restores glomerular hypertrophy and renal cellular replication, and prevents the increment in glomerular fibronectin.", 
    "637": "Renal involvement is relatively common in certain systemic autoimmune diseases, but can be clinically silent. Active surveillance is, therefore, essential because the early recognition of renal involvement may influence the extent of renal recovery. Blood pressure control is also essential, regardless of the underlying disease. In systemic lupus erythematosus, therapy usually depends on the renal biopsy findings as not all forms of renal involvement respond in the same way. Typically, for aggressive disease, therapy is with steroids and a cytotoxic agent, usually cyclophosphamide initially and then azathioprine. In systemic vasculitis with renal involvement, a similar approach is adopted, therapy including steroids and cyclophosphamide initially and then steroids and azathioprine. With severe fulminant disease, plasma exchange or pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone is added initially. Scleroderma renal crises are managed by blood pressure control using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other agents as required. Dialysis and transplantation can be successful in these conditions.",

However, the molecular mechanism of this recognition process (induced fit or prebinding and adaptive selection among multiple conformers) in several cases remains unexplored. In order to shed light toward this step of the recognition process in the case of human angiotensin I converting enzyme (hACE) and its inhibitor captopril, we have established a novel combinatorial approach exploiting solution NMR, flexible docking calculations, mutagenesis, and enzymatic studies. We provide evidence that an equimolar ratio of the cis and trans states of captopril exists in solution and that the enzyme selects only the trans state of the inhibitor that presents architectural and stereoelectronic complementarity with its substrate binding groove.",

The GRDFs should remain in the stomach for a prolonged period of time due to their size. The dosage forms were prepared from collagen sponges. The sponges were manufactured by freeze-drying a riboflavin-containing collagen solution. A computer controlled material supply was constructed to transport precompressed collagen into a tablet machine. A second type of tablet was manufactured by combining compressed collagen sponges with hydrophilic matrix layers of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. Matrix layers containing captopril or aciclovir were developed. In vitro experiments were performed with both types of dosage forms. The collagen tablets expand within a few minutes after contact with artificial gastric juice and form a drug delivery system with a size of 8 mm x 18 mm x 60 mm. Riboflavin is released over 16 h. If two layer tablets are used, the release of aciclovir or captopril can be controlled by the composition of the sustained release layer.",

However, the effects of these substances on the cardiovascular system of higher vertebrates are not very well documented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a cardioexcitatory substance (CES) isolated from the eyestalk of the shrimp Peneaus vanameii on rat cardiovascular function. The administration of a purified fraction of this substance raised mean arterial pressure by 37.33 +/- 5.00 mm Hg, pulse pressure 35.00 +/- 4.93 mm Hg and heart rate 80.00 +/- 12.83 beats/min over basal values (p < 0.01). Evaluation of the possible underlying mechanisms of this hypertensive and tachycardic effect reveled that dihydroergotamine pretreatment (20 microg/0.2 mL) reduced the effect of CES on mean blood pressure, but not on heart rate. Propranolol pretreatment (4 microg/0.2 mL) reduced the tachycardia, but not the hypertensive response. Enalapril pretreatment (5 microg/0.2 mL) did not modify the effects induced by CES on heart rate or blood pressure, and the verapamil pretreatment (1 microg/0.2 mL) reduced both cardiovascular changes by 85% (p < 0.01). These results indicate that CES isolated from the shrimp eyestalk produces hypertension and tachycardia mediated by adrenergic receptors in association to calcium channels activation.",

Once the patient with stroke has stabilized, all patients should receive blood pressure-lowering therapy, irrespective of their blood pressure levels. Combination therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus a diuretic is an established regimen, but an angiotensin II-receptor blocker may provide an alternative regimen in patients who do not tolerate an ACE inhibitor, especially in combination with a diuretic.

We evaluated the clinicopathologic predictors of response to CEI+ARB in 43 patients with primary glomerulonephritis (GN), never treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and with persistent proteinuria after CEI alone. Main histological lesions were analyzed by obtaining on 557 glomeruli and 165 arteries formal score of mesangial cellularity, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage, mononuclear cell infiltration, arteriosclerosis, and arteriolar hyalinosis. Duration of CEI and CEI+ARB therapy was similar (4.7+/-2.4 and 5.0+/-1.5 months). Proteinuria (g/day) decreased from 3.5+/-2.9 to 2.4+/-2.3 after CEI, and to 1.5+/-1.3 after CEI+ARB (P<0.0001). Reduction of proteinuria after CEI+ARB was greater in proliferative versus non-proliferative GN (-63.3+/-23.4 versus 42.4+/-23.7%, respectively; P=0.006). When patients were categorized in responders and non-responders to CEI+ARB, no difference between the two groups was detected in any demographic or clinical variable, whereas histology showed in responders a greater prevalence of proliferative GN (71.4 versus 31.8%, P=0.009) and higher score of mesangial cellularity (1.76+/-0.53 versus 1.20+/-0.22, P<0.0001). At multiple regression analysis (r(2)=0.476, P=0.001), response to CEI+ARB resulted independently related only to mesangial cellularity (P<0.0001). In conclusion, the best independent predictor of antiproteinuric efficacy of CEI+ARB in patients with primary GN is the degree of mesangial cellularity. This finding supports the experimental evidence that high angiotensin II contributes to proliferation of mesangial cells.",

Therapy with Q was associated with \"escape\" of blockade of aldosterone synthesis and \"reactivation\" of angiotensin II formation after 6 months. The use of V and combination of V+Q allowed to achieve more stable but incomplete control of aldosterone activity.

Under normal conditions the endothelium induces NO-mediated vasodilation, and opposes cell adhesion and thrombosis. Angiotensin II-induced generation of reactive oxygen species plays a key role in the pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction by reducing NO bioavailability. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with several pathologic conditions, including hypertension and diabetes, and is characterized by altered vascular tone, inflammation, and thrombosis in the vascular wall. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has induced beneficial effects on endothelial function in animals and humans.

It has a large impact in terms of associated morbidity and mortality for the individual patient and in terms of costs for healthcare. Several studies have demonstrated that micro- and macroalbuminuria predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus.Current nephroprotective therapies for diabetic nephropathy include the pursuit of normoglycemia and normotension, and a consensus is emerging that there is a necessity to also achieve as low a level of albuminuria as possible. However, the search for innovative and ancillary approaches to the prevention and treatment of this diabetic complication is warranted since strict metabolic control can be difficult, and sometimes dangerous, to achieve and even diabetic patients responding to ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs) and metabolic control show progressive renal damage and eventually ESRD. A number of drugs are currently being investigated; glycosaminoglycans are particularly interesting since, in theory, they target the generalized endothelial dysfunction and metabolic defect in matrix and basement membrane synthesis which, according to the Steno hypothesis, are responsible for diabetic nephropathy and macroangiopathy.Treatment with glycosaminoglycans, and with sulodexide in particular, significantly improves albuminuria in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria. The albuminuria-lowering effect of sulodexide enhances the effect of ACEI/ARB therapy. Most studies have shown that the effect of sulodexide on albuminuria is sustained, strongly suggesting that favorable chemical and anatomic remodeling is induced by exogenous glycosaminoglycans in renal tisues, as observed in the experimental model.",

In animals with a model edema syndrome caused by subdiaphragm constriction of the interior vena cava, a hyper-NaCl diet enhances the Na-diuretic action of enalapril in both subacute and chronic stage of circulation insufficiency. In addition, enalapril increases the creatinin secretion in rats with this model (but not in intact animals). The administraton of enalapril in animals with caval obstruction receiving excess NaCl, in contrast to the case of standard diet, decreases the consumption of water, thus preventing the development of a positive balance of water.",

Those with existing hypertension are more likely to see a blood pressure elevation, although the magnitude of the effect is less predictable and may vary with age, baseline blood pressure, type of NSAID and concurrent antihypertensive therapy. The magnitude of the blood pressure increase appears to be similar for both NSAIDs and paracetamol, while low-dose aspirin may have more modest effects. In hypertensive adults who experience deterioration of blood pressure control on NSAIDs, there is some, albeit suboptimal, evidence that the blood pressure-raising effects of NSAIDs are less when used in conjunction with dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

The beneficial impact of lipid-lowering drugs on AF risk was independent of their effects on the lipid profile. In patients in whom data on specific lipid-lowering drugs were available, 92% of the patients undergoing lipid-lowering therapy received statins, and 98% received statins and/or fibrates.", 
    "705": "Use of lipid-lowering drugs in patients with reduced LVEF is associated with a significant reduction in the prevalence of AF independent of the lipid profile and other known arrhythmia risk factors. This effect is larger than that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers or beta-blockers and may be the result of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of statins and fibrates.", 
    "706": "Hypertension (HT) and aortic valve regurgitation (AR) often coexist but the specific impacts of AR + HT on the left ventricle (LV) are still unknown. The best treatment strategy for this combination of diseases is also unclear. The objectives of this study were 1) to evaluate LV function, remodeling and 2) to assess the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (C) in rats with AR +/- HT in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).", 
    "707": "Animals were grouped as follows: normotensive (NT) Wistar-Kyoto, NT + AR, hypertensive SHR (HT), and HT + AR receiving or not captopril (150 mg/kg/d). Hearts were evaluated in vivo by echocardiography and harvested for tissue analysis after 6 months of evolution.", 
    "708": "The HT + AR rats had the worst LV hypertrophy (LVH), subendocardial fibrosis, and lowest ejection fraction. Captopril normalized BP in HT and HT + AR, but could not prevent LVH in HT + AR as well as it did in isolated HT. The LV ejection fraction remained below normal in HT + AR + captopril compared to HT alone + captopril. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy remained in HT + AR + captopril but was normalized in HT + captopril. Subendocardial fibrosis was reduced by captopril in HT + AR.", 
    "709": "The AR + HT rats had the most severe myocardial abnormalities. High dose captopril was effective to slow LVH and preserve normal LV ejection fraction in isolated HT or AR, but was less effective when both pathologies were combined. Prohypertrophic stimuli clearly remain active in HT + AR despite ACE inhibition. These results suggest that a very aggressive medical treatment strategy may be required to optimize LV protection when AR and HT co-exist.", 
    "710": "Few antihypertensive therapies have been systematically studied in children and dosages for many agents are either extrapolated from adult studies or obtained from small homogenous pediatric populations. It is well established that adult patients of different races show disparate response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, however no such studies have been performed in children.", 
    "711": "Two hundred fifty three children ages 6-16 with hypertension or with high normal blood pressure with an associated medical condition requiring antihypertensive therapy were enrolled at 78 clinical sites in the US, Russia, and Israel in a double blind study to evaluate the efficacy of fosinopril compared to placebo.", 
    "712": "The racial composition of the cohort included 60.1% white (152/253), 20.6% black (52/253), 13.8% Hispanic (35/253), 2.0% Asian (5/253), 0.4% Native American (1/253), and 3.2% (8/253) children classified as other or of mixed race. After adjusting for baseline blood pressure and body surface area (BSA) there was no significant dose response seen in non-black patients. Non-blacks randomized to the low, medium, and high dosages of fosinopril all had a mean decrease of 12 mm Hg in their sequential systolic BP (SBP). Blacks, however, demonstrated a significant dose response to fosinopril; those who received the low dosage had a 5 mm Hg decrease in SBP, and those who received the high dosage had a mean 13 mm Hg decrease in SBP.", 
    "713": "Fosinopril was effective in treating hypertension, but black children required a higher dose per body weight in order to achieve adequate control. This suggests that black children treated with fosinopril for hypertension on average require higher doses to achieve adequate systolic blood pressure control that non-black children.", 
    "714": "Little is known regarding the risk factors for early and late death after hospital discharge among pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery.", 
    "715": "Statewide hospital discharge data from California in 1989 to 1999 were used to study outcomes of children <18 years old who had a procedure code (by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) indicating cardiac surgery. The outcome variable was death occurring after hospital discharge. Postdischarge deaths were identified by linking hospital discharge data to statewide death registry data. Cardiac surgical procedures were grouped into 23 categories to adjust for risk involved with the procedures. We used logistic regression to evaluate risk factors for postdischarge mortality, including variables age, sex, race and ethnicity, type of insurance, home income, date and month of surgery, type of admission, hospitals case volume, and the various types of procedures.", 
    "716": "There were 25,402 cardiac surgery cases with 1505 inhospital deaths. Of 23,897 hospital discharges, 148 deaths (0.62%) occurred within 365 days after discharge, including 37 deaths within 30 days; 44 deaths at 31 to 90 days; and 67 deaths at 91 to 365 days. Logistic regression showed young age was an important risk factor for postdischarge death with an odds ratio of 4.8 for neonates and 3.5 for infants, compared with children >1 year old. Another significant risk factor was the type of procedure. For death <30 days after discharge, Norwood operation (odds ratio 8.4 compared with closure of ventricular septal defect) was a risk factor. For death that occurred between 31 and 365 days, significant risk factors were truncus arteriosus repair, total anomalous pulmonary vein repair, aortopulmonary shunt, and open valvotomy. Sex, race/ethnicity, home income, and hospital case volume were not significant predictors of postdischarge deaths.", 
    "717": "Many demographic and socioeconomic variables affecting inhospital death were not significant predictors for postdischarge death. Important risk factors for postdischarge death were young age and the type of surgery performed.", 
    "718": "Prior studies have reported conflicting findings concerning the association of socioeconomic status (SES), treatment, and outcomes in patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF).", 
    "719": "We conducted a retrospective analysis of medical record data from a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with HF between March 1998 and April 1999 (n = 25,086) to assess the association of patient SES, treatment, and outcomes. Patients' SES was designated as lower, lower-middle, higher-middle, and higher using residential ZIP code characteristics. Patients were evaluated for left ventricular systolic function assessment, prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at discharge, readmission within 1 year of discharge, and mortality within 30 days and 1 year of admission. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to assess the association of SES, quality of care, and outcomes adjusting for patient, physician, and hospital characteristics.", 
    "720": "Lower SES patients (relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.96) were modestly less likely to have had a left ventricular systolic function assessment, but had a similar adjusted likelihood of being prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93-1.11) compared with higher SES patients after multivariable adjustment. Socioeconomic status was not associated with 30-day mortality after multivariable adjustment, but lower SES patients had a higher risk of 1-year mortality (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.19) and readmission within 1 year of discharge (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.12) compared with higher SES patients.", 
    "721": "Socioeconomic status in patients hospitalized with HF was not strongly associated with quality of care or 30-day mortality. However, the increased risk of 1-year mortality and readmission among patients of lower SES suggest SES may influence outcomes after hospitalization for HF.", 
    "722": "Few recent studies have demonstrated similar quality of care for hospitalized black and white patients with heart failure (HF). However, systematic evaluation of racial differences in both the quality of care and outcomes is needed in the outpatient setting, where most patients with HF are treated and where care may be more fragmented.",

    "724": "Black patients were more likely to have left ventricular ejection fraction assessment than whites (risk-adjusted OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49). In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, blacks were as likely as whites to be on treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (risk-adjusted OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85-1.33) and beta-blockers (risk-adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.07). However, black patients more frequently had uncontrolled hypertension and were more likely to be hospitalized for any cause (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08-1.33) or for HF (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.23-1.66), although 1-year mortality did not differ by race (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89-1.20).", 
    "725": "In a financially \"equal access\" health care system, the quality of outpatient HF care assessed by select quality measures and 1-year mortality was similar in black compared to white patients. However, blacks were more likely to be hospitalized, especially with HF. Identifying and targeting potentially modifiable factors such as uncontrolled hypertension in black patients may narrow the racial gap in hospitalizations.",

    "728": "PubMed and Cochrane clinical trials database were searched from 1980 through March 2005 together with the review of citations. Nine randomized controlled human trials reporting the prevention of new-onset AF by inhibition of renin-angiotensin system were identified. Information about study design, follow-up, intervention, population, outcomes, and methodology quality was extracted.", 
    "729": "The mean follow-up of the studies ranged from 6 months to 6.1 year. The pooled estimate using random effects model was 0.82 (95% CI 0.70-0.97) for prevention of new-onset AF and 0.61 (95% CI 0.46-0.83) for primary prevention of AF. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.99) had greater protective effect than angiotensin receptor blockers (0.81, 95% CI 0.62-1.06). Patients with heart failure benefited the most (0.57, 95% CI 0.37-0.89). The test for heterogeneity between studies was significant. There was no consistent visual or statistical evidence of publication bias.",

    "731": "Animal blood is potentially an untapped source of drugs and value-added food production. More than 400 million pigs are slaughtered each year but porcine blood is usually discarded in China. This study describes the isolation and characterization of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides derived from porcine hemoglobin. The most active hydrolysate was obtained from the peptic digestion of porcine hemoglobin. After the purification of ACE-inhibitory peptides with Sephadex LH-20 gel chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on C(18) column, two active fractions were obtained. They were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). They were LGFPTTKTYFPHF and VVYPWT, corresponding to the 34-46 fragment of the alpha chain and the 34-39 fragment of the beta chain of porcine hemoglobin, with IC(50) values of 4.92 and 6.02 microM, respectively. They were the first found from porcine hemoglobin; in particular, LGFPTTKTYFPHF was a novel ACE-inhibitory peptide. In addition, the purified ACE inhibitors both competitively inhibited ACE, and maintained inhibitory activity even after incubation with gastrointestinal proteases. This suggests that these peptides might have a potential antihypertensive effect.", 
    "732": "The aim of the study was to compare the hypotensive effect and safety of carvedilol, a non-selective alpha-beta blocker, and monopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), in patients with arterial hypertension and a chronic renal disease. The main group (MG), 26 patients, was treated with carvedilol, which was administered as a hypotensive agent instead of the ACEi. The control group (CG) included 24 patients on a \"standard\" therapy with hypothiazide 12.5 mg a day, amlodipine 10 mg a day, and monopril 20 mg a day. Patients who received carvedilol displayed an earlier hypotensive effect (HE). Together with HE realization, the patients of both groups displayed a moderate increase in glomerular filtration (not more than by 10 ml/min), and an increase in creatinine blood level (not more than by 15%) during the first two weeks, which can be explained by a decrease in intraglomerular hypertension. A significant decrease in total cholesterol level and a more pronounced regress of left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy were noticed in the MG vs. the CG. Measurement of the serum levels of cortisol, aldosterone, and angiotensin I showed that the patients of the MG displayed a significant decrease in aldosterone level together with a clear tendency of cortisol level increase. The concentrations of these hormones in CG patients did not change significantly. The result demonstrate that prolonged administration of carvedilol leads to a noticeable decrease in the serum level of aldosterone, an increase in cortisol level, and electrolyte changes, such as an increase in sodium level and a decrease in potassium level in blood plasma.",

    "734": "This prospective community-based study assessed the impact of early nephrology referral on the drug treatments of a consecutive series of patients. More than 98% of patients with end-stage renal disease, living in a French region, who began kidney replacement therapy (KRT) between 1997 and 1999 were enrolled. They were classified into 5 groups according to the timing of the 1st serum creatinine reading in excess of 2 mg/dL and the 1st visit to a nephrologist. The drugs prescribed and the appropriateness of therapeutic care at the initiation of KRT and 6 months later were compared between groups.", 
    "735": "Five hundred and two patients were included. On initiation of KRT, early referral patients were more likely than other groups to be receiving epoetin, iron salts, phosphate binders, synthetic vitamin D, and/or ACE inhibitors. The earlier the nephrology care, the more appropriate was treatment by epoetin, phosphate binders and vitamin D. Six months later, the 5 groups did not differ in the drugs prescribed or their appropriateness.", 
    "736": "This study provides evidence of an association between the timing of nephrology referral and the quality of therapeutic drug care at the start of KRT. Later, when all patients are under the care of a nephrologist, drug treatments are no longer related to the timing of referral.", 
    "737": "A series of metallopeptides based on the amino terminal copper/nickel (ATCUN) binding motif have been evaluated as classical inhibitors and catalytic inactivators of both rabbit and human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE), and human endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (hECE-1). The cobalt complex [KGHK-Co(NH3)2]2+, where KGHK is lysylglycylhistidyllysine, displayed similar K(I) and IC50 values to those found for [KGHK-Cu]+, in spite of the enhanced charge, and so either the influence of charge is offset by the steric influence of the axially coordinated ammine ligands, or binding is dominated by contributions from the amino acid side chains, especially the C-terminal lysine that mimics the binding pattern observed for lisinopril. Moreover, the inhibition observed for [KGHK-Co(NH3)2]2+ contrasts with the activation of hACE by Co2+(aq), reflecting the stimulation of enzyme activity following replacement of the catalytic zinc cofactor by cobalt ion at each of the two active sites. Quantitative analysis of the dose-dependent stimulation of activity by Co2+(aq) yielded apparent affinities of 1.3 +/- 0.2 and 56 +/- 8 microM for the two sites in the presence of saturating Zn2+ (10 microM). Catalytic inactivation of hACE by [KGHK-Cu]+ at subsaturating concentrations had previously been characterized, with k(obs) = 2.9 +/- 0.5 x 10(-2) min(-1). Under similar conditions, the same complex is found to catalytically inactivate hECE-1, with k(obs) = 2.12 +/- 0.16 x 10(-2) min(-1), demonstrating the potential for dual-action activity against two key drug targets in cardiovascular disease. Irreversible inactivation of a drug target represents a novel mechanism of drug action that complements existing classical inhibitor strategies that underlie current drug discovery efforts.",

More men were smokers and had low HDL cholesterol, but more women had elevated total and LDL cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes. More men had Q wave acute myocardial infarction, but more women had angina. Over 5 years, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia decreased substantially from 82.7 to 65%. Eighty-three percent of patients received aspirin and this percentage did not change during the study. The use of diuretics, calcium antagonists and nitrates did not change either. The reported use of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers increased significantly.", 
    "741": "This survey shows a high prevalence of modifiable risk factors in Croatian patients with coronary heart disease. Although the higher use of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers is encouraging, the fact that most coronary heart disease patients are still not achieving the recommended goals remains a concern. There is real potential to reduce the very high coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in Croatia.",

Patients > or =65 years of age, those with higher HbA(1c), those with cardiovascular disease (CVD), and those without hyperlipidemia were less likely to be screened. Of the patients with positive screening tests, 47% began ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy. Initiation of therapy was associated with positive screening test results, BMI > or =25 kg/m(2), treatment with insulin or oral antidiabetic agents, peripheral neuropathy, systolic blood pressure > or =140 mmHg, and CVD. Of the patients receiving ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy or with known DKD, 63% were tested for albuminuria.", 
    "745": "Screening for albuminuria was inadequate, especially in older patients or those with competing medical concerns. The value of screening could be increased if more patients with positive screening tests initiated ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy. The efficiency of screening could be improved by limiting screening to diabetic patients not receiving ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy and without known DKD.",

The following data were collected: patient demographics, history of cigarette smoking, presence of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; and anesthetic technique, including: preanesthetic anxiolytic medication, prior use of atropine, epidural lidocaine, a priming dose of vecuronium, and the dose of i.v. fentanyl. Associations between individual variables in the clinical evaluation model and the likelihood of fentanyl-induced cough were characterized by calculating odds ratios. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the independent contribution of each variable while controlling for all variables.",

Total survivin and survivin-DeltaEx3 were highest in samples with advanced histological grade, whereas patients with 4-9 involved lymph nodes expressed less survivin-2B mRNA than those with 1-3 involved nodes. All variants were higher in tumors negative for steroid hormone receptors. Total survivin, survivin 2alpha, and survivin-3B were associated with poor relapse-free survival in univariate analyses. Survivin 2alpha and survivin-3B added to the prognostic value of total survivin in multivariate analyses. In addition, the prognostic value of total survivin was evident only in the presence of higher expression levels of these 2 variants.",

The present study consisted of a pre-specified subset of these subjects divided into patients receiving (n = 1352) and not receiving (n = 1314) preoperative statin therapy. To control for potential bias related to use of statin therapy, the study estimated propensity scores by logistic regression to determine the predicted probability of inclusion in the \"statin\" group. Multivariate, stepwise logistic regression was then performed, controlling for patient demographics, medical history, operative characteristics, and propensity score to determine whether preoperative statin therapy was independently associated with a reduction in the risk of early (DOS-POD3) cardiac death and/or nonfatal, in-hospital postoperative myocardial infarction.",

The first method is based on the oxidation of the drug with 1-chlorobenzotriazole reagent (CBT) in strong alkaline medium followed by measuring the absorbance at 350 nm. The method obeys Beer's law over concentration range 15-50 microg ml(-1). For the second and third, both are non-extractive methods based on the formation of ternary complex between copper (II), eosin and ramipril in the presence of methylcellulose as surfactant. Spectrophotometrically, under the optimum condition, the ternary complex showed an absorption maximum at 543 nm. The method obeys Beer's law over concentration range of 20-80 microg ml(-1). A fluorescence quenching method for the determination of ramipril by forming this ternary complex was also investigated for the propose of enhance the sensitivity of the determination. The methods are simple, sensitive, and accurate. The results obtained are reproducible with a coefficient of variation less than 2%. The proposed have been successfully applied to the assay of ramipril in tablets. The results compare favorably with official method.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate if the connection between tea and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and nitric oxide (NO) might be an explanation of the pharmacological effects of tea on the cardiovascular system. Cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical veins (HUVEC) were incubated with extracts of Japanese Sencha (green tea), Indian Assam Broken Orange Pekoe (black tea) and Rooibos tea, respectively. The main flavanols and purine alkaloids in green and black tea were examined for their effects on ACE and NO. After incubation with green tea, black tea and Rooibos tea for 10 min, a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of ACE activity in HUVEC was seen with the green tea and the black tea. No significant effect on ACE was seen with the Rooibos tea. After 10-min incubation with (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechingallate and (-)-epigallocatechingallate, a dose-dependent inhibition of ACE activity in HUVEC was seen for all four tea catechins. After 24-h incubation, a significantly increased dose-dependent effect on NO production in HUVEC was seen for the green tea, the black tea and the Rooibos tea. After 24-h incubation with (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechingallate and (-)-epigallocatechingallate, a dose-dependent increased NO production in HUVEC was seen.

However, the potential role of RAS inhibition on expression transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-Smads in hepatic fibrosis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan) on TGF-beta1 and TGF receptor II (TRII) mRNA, Smad3 and Smad7 in fibrotic hepatic livers in rats.", 
    "765": "Sixty Wistar rats were randomly divided into four study groups (n = 15 for each group), including normal controls, hepatic fibrosis models, and two treated groups with either perindopril or valsartan, starting from the fourth week after being exposed to carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) for 4 weeks. The levels of TGF-beta and TRII mRNA in liver tissue were analyzed by RT-PCR. The expressions of TGF-beta1, Smad3 and Smad7 in liver tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The liver histopathology was examined by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and by electron microscopy, respectively. The liver function and serum hyaluronic acid were also assayed by biochemistry and radioimmunoassay.", 
    "766": "Compared with the hepatic fibrosis models, the levels of TGF-beta1, TRII mRNA and the expression Smad3 significantly decreased in the two treated groups, and the expression of Smad7 was significantly increased in the liver of rats treated with perindopril or valsartan (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The histological changes and ultrastructure of fibrotic liver, liver function and hyaluronic acid also remarkably improved in the treated rats.", 
    "767": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors perindopril and valsartan have a protective effect on liver injury and can ameliorate hepatic fibrosis in rats induced by CCl(4).

    "768": "Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at a markedly higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with evidence indicating that risk-reduction pharmacotherapy can serve to attenuate cardiovascular events in these patients. Given the central role of vascular surgeons in the treatment of patients with PAD, we sought to determine their perceptions and knowledge of risk-reduction pharmacotherapy in patients with PAD. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 79 Canadian vascular surgeons who attended the 2004 annual meeting of the Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery, the largest and most representative meeting of its kind in Canada. The recommended targets of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood glucose, and blood pressure were known to 53.8%, 40.4%, and 57.7% of vascular surgeons, respectively. The majority of vascular surgeons (65.4%) reported screening for risk factors in <50% of cases. Although 90.4% of vascular surgeons would recommend antiplatelet therapy for PAD, only 5.8% would recommend angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 19.2% would recommend lipid-lowering therapy with statins. Eighty-four percent of Canadian vascular surgeons indicated that their self-assessment of risk reduction in PAD was average to below average, yet 90.4% of them believed that risk-reduction therapy should be recommended or initiated by vascular surgeons. Canadian vascular surgeons' perceptions toward risk reduction in PAD identify knowledge and action gaps, despite the recognition that recommending and instituting therapy is important to patient care. Given the heightened risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with PAD, these data have important implications.", 
    "769": "Cardiovascular events (CVEs) are the leading cause of death in chronic hemodialysis patients. Results of trials in non-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients cannot be extrapolated to patients with ESRD. It is critical to test cardiovascular therapies in these high-risk patients who are usually excluded from major cardiovascular trials. The study objective was to evaluate the effect of fosinopril on CVEs in patients with ESRD. Eligible patients were randomized to fosinopril 5 mg titrated to 20 mg daily (n=196) or placebo (n=201) plus conventional therapy for 24 months. The primary end point was combined fatal and nonfatal first major CVEs (cardiovascular death, resuscitated death, nonfatal stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, or revascularization). No significant benefit for fosinopril was observed in the intent to treat analysis (n=397) after adjusting for independent predictors of CVEs (RR=0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-1.26, P=0.35). The per protocol secondary supportive analysis (n=380) found a trend towards benefit for fosinopril (adjusted RR=0.79 (95% CI 0.59-1.1, P=0.099)). In the patients who were hypertensive at baseline, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased in the fosinopril as compared to the placebo group. After adjustment for risk factors, trends were observed suggesting fosinopril may be associated with a lower risk of CVEs. These trends may have become statistically significant had the sample size been larger, and these findings warrant further study.", 
    "770": "The term microalbuminuria--a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) between 20 and 200 microg/min--has been introduced to identify subjects at increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between albuminuria and risk is not restricted to the microalbuminuric range and extends to as low as 2-5 microg/min. On the contrary, the increase of UAE above 200 microg/min (macroalbuminuria) heralds the onset of proteinuria (urinary protein excretion above 0.5 g/24 h) and progressive renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria is a component of the metabolic syndrome and may represent a marker of the increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease associated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Proteinuria is a sign of established kidney damage and plays a direct pathogenic role in the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria reflects functional and potentially reversible abnormalities initiated by glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria, a size-selective dysfunction of the glomerular barrier normally associated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline that may result in end-stage renal disease. Thus, the limit of 200 microg/min segregates patients with albuminuria or proteinuria who are at quite different risk. Among subjects with albuminuria, however, there is a continuous relationship between albumin excretion and risk and no lower bound between normal albuminuria and microalbuminuria can be identified that segregates subjects at different risk. Thus, the terms microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria could be replaced by the concepts of albuminuria- and proteinuria-associated diseases. Future studies are needed to identify levels of albuminuria below which therapy is no longer beneficial.", 
    "771": "We report a rare case of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia type II with membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type I in which HCV was not found. Long-term history of palindromic rheumatism, skin leukocytoclastic vasculitis attacks and micro-normocytic anemia preceded the appearance of cryoglobulinemia. Cryoprecipitate consisted of monoclonal IgMk-RF and polyclonal IgG (essential mixed type II). The newly appreciated cryoglobulinemia was associated with Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. The MPGN in this case had a benign course and responded to complex simple therapies including prevention of exposure to cold, low antigen content diet, treatment of provoking factors such as UTI, and maximal dose of ACE inhibitor. Responsiveness of skin vasculitis to colchicine therapy was restored after a two-month colchicine withdrawal period and therefore corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy was postponed.", 
    "772": "The beneficial effect exerted by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on vascular endothelium has been attributed to restoration of endothelial cell survival properties and improvement of angiogenesis. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 is an angiogenic factor for the microvascular endothelium, which tonically promotes endothelial cell growth and survival through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Here, we formulate the hypothesis that FGF-2 might contribute to the prosurvival/proangiogenic effect of ACEI. We investigated zofenoprilat and, in selected experiments, lisinopril, as representatives of ACEI. These compounds induced formation of pseudocapillaries in vessel fragments isolated from porcine coronary and human umbilical arteries by increasing endothelial cell growth up to 5-fold. Angiogenesis was abolished by inhibitors of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) pathway and by anti-FGF-2 antibodies. Consistently, in cultured coronary endothelial cells (CVECs), ACEI up-regulated endothelial NOS (eNOS) and FGF-2 and induced mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. The overexpression of eNOS/FGF-2 produced, at the functional level, enhanced cell proliferation and migration, the latter effect being dose-dependent and maximal at 0.1 microM zofenoprilat. The importance of FGF-2 for the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype elicited by ACEI was clearly demonstrated by the impairment of endothelial functions following transfection of CVECs with small interference RNA for FGF-2. Moreover, FGF-2 silencing greatly affected the nuclear translocation of the FGF receptor (FGFR)-1, highlighting the autocrine mode of action of FGF-2. At the endothelial membrane level, zofenoprilat appeared to activate the bradykinin B1 receptor, a known stimulant of FGF-2 expression. In conclusion, we show that ACEI exert protective/proangiogenic effects in microvascular coronary endothelial cells by activating the endogenous FGF-2/FGFR-1 system.", 
    "773": "Lowering blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients reduces morbidity and mortality. However the long-term safety of some antihypertensive agents was a matter of concern. Diuretic, the gold standard treatment in hypertension may impair glucose tolerance and thereby accelerate the development of diabetes mellitus. It was also associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients. However, recent evidence showed that low-medium dose of thiazide diuretic especially when given in combination with potassium sparing agent is effective in reducing BP and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Beta blockers are less effective than other antihypertensive agents in the elderly. Therefore they may be appropriate as a first choice in young and middle-age hypertensives, and in those with fast heart rate, but they should not be considered appropriate as the first-line therapy in the elderly with uncomplicated hypertension. Several years ago a plethora of publications showed that short-acting calcium antagonists may increase the risk for myocardial infarction and cancer. A few years ago two studies showed that calcium antagonists are less effective than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing cardiovascular events in diabetic hypertensive patients. However, recent results from large prospective randomized studies showed that calcium antagonists reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic and non-diabetic hypertensive patients. Some investigators have suggested that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients. However, recent meta analyses refuted this conclusions and showed that ARBs are probably as effective as other antihypertensive agents in prevention of myocardial infarction. Despite the concern that has been raised regarding the long-term safety of some antihypertensive agents, it is clear that lowering BP is safe and beneficial.", 
    "774": "We investigated the effect of adding spironolactone to treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, imidapril, in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) hypertensive heart failure rats with preserved systolic function. Male DS rats were fed laboratory chow containing 8% NaCl from 7 weeks of age. Rats were divided into four groups and treated for 9 weeks with vehicle alone (water; n = 23), the ACE inhibitor imidapril (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1); n = 16), spironolactone (2 mg kg(-1) day(-1); n = 15), or a combination of imidapril and spironolactone at the doses above (n = 16). The left ventricular weight to body weight (BW) ratio was significantly lower in the imidapril group (3.28 +/- 0.30 mg g(-1)) and the combination group (3.34 +/- 0.38 mg g(-1)) than in the vehicle group (3.71 +/- 0.46 mg g(-1)). Adding spironolactone to imidapril inhibited an increase in the ratio of lung weight to BW (4.38 +/- 0.50 mg g(-1)) related to high salt intake, while monotherapy (imidapril group, 4.61 +/- 0.90 mg g(-1); spironolactone group, 5.40 +/- 2.50) did not significantly change the ratio from that seen with vehicle treatment (6.32 +/- 3.62 mg g(-1)). All active treatments (imidapril, 0.66% +/- 0.67%; spironolactone, 0.51% +/- 0.55%; both together, 0.31% +/- 0.26%) inhibited a salt-intake related increase in the percentage area representing fibrous tissue compared with vehicle treatment alone (1.81% +/- 1.51%). These findings suggest that adding spironolactone to an ACE inhibitor is more effective in improving pulmonary congestion and edema in hypertensive heart failure with preserved systolic function than an ACE inhibitor alone.",

Diagnoses included Duchenne muscular dystrophy (n=25), Fukuyama muscular dystrophy (n=2), and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (n=1). Echocardiographic parameters of the left ventricle were measured during the 2-3 years of follow-up. In the carvedilol group, combination therapy of carvedilol and an ACEI for 2 years resulted in a significant increase in left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS). In the ACEI group, there was no significant change in LVFS. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased in the ACEI group, but not in the carvedilol group.",

    "778": "The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) provides a unique opportunity to compare the long-term relative safety and efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium channel blocker-initiated therapy in older hypertensive individuals. Patients were randomized to amlodipine (n=9048) or lisinopril (n=9054). The primary outcome was combined fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, combined cardiovascular disease (CVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cancer, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. Blood pressure control was similar in nonblacks, but not in blacks. No significant differences were found between treatment groups for the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, ESRD, or cancer. Stroke rates were higher on lisinopril in blacks (RR=1.51, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.86) but not in nonblacks (RR=1.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.28), and in women (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.79), but not in men (RR=1.10, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.31). Rates of combined CVD were higher (RR=1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12) because of higher rates for strokes, peripheral arterial disease, and angina, which were partly offset by lower rates for heart failure (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.96) on lisinopril compared with amlodipine. Gastrointestinal bleeds and angioedema were higher on lisinopril. Patients with and without baseline coronary heart disease showed similar outcome patterns. We conclude that in hypertensive patients, the risks for coronary events are similar, but for stroke, combined CVD, gastrointestinal bleeding, and angioedema are higher and for heart failure are lower for lisinopril-based compared with amlodipine-based therapy. Some, but not all, of these differences may be explained by less effective blood pressure control in the lisinopril arm.", 
    "779": "Alterations in the vascular angiotensin II system may play a role in the pathophysiology of vascular disease after menopause. In previous studies we have shown that an increase in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels in aging rats because of estrogen deficiency may result in vascular dysfunction. In this study we investigated the effect of TNF-alpha inhibition in angiotensin II modulation of vascular function in aging female animals. Female rats approaching reproductive senescence (12 to 15 months old) were ovariectomized and treated with placebo, estrogen, or a selective TNF-alpha inhibitor (etanercept) for 4 weeks. Expression of angiotensin II in mesenteric arteries was evaluated by immunofluorescence, and the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin type I receptor (AT(1)R) was investigated by Western immunoblot. Vascular function was assessed in mesenteric arteries using the myograph system, and the role of endogenous angiotensin II on adrenergic vasoconstriction was evaluated in vitro by selective AT(1)R blockade (Candesartan; 10 micromol/L). Our data demonstrate that estrogen-depleted rats have higher serum levels of TNF-alpha and greater sensitivity to phenylephrine vasoconstriction compared with estrogen-replaced animals, which was attenuated by AT(1)R blockade. In vivo TNF-alpha inhibition or estrogen replacement reduced phenylephrine constriction of mesenteric arteries and decreased the modulation of this vasoconstriction by candesartan. These functional changes were accompanied by a reduction in the vascular expression of angiotensin II, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and AT(1)R. These observations indicate that upregulation of TNF-alpha during estrogen deficiency may contribute to enhance vascular constriction by altering the vascular angiotensin II system.",

    "814": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is one of main predecessors of chronic heart failure (CHF), for the treatment of which angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are recommended at present. It seems logical to prescribe ACEI in early period of MI in order to prevent development of CHF in postinfarction period. For assessment of benefit and risk related to prescription of ACEI early after onset of acute MI multiple placebo controlled trials have been carried out. Data obtained in these trials evidence for inexpediency of wide use of ACEI in acute period of MI. Several categories of patients with acute MI with stable hemodynamics have been established in whom benefit of early prescription of ACEI noticeably outweighs possible risk. Those are patients with clinical manifestations of CHF or echocardiographical signs of systolic left ventricular dysfunction as well as patients with high risk of development of CHF in postinfarction period. The latter group comprises patients with transmural MI of the anterior left ventricular wall in whom thrombolytic therapy either have not been carried out or have been ineffective, patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension in anamnesis. In all other cases prescription of ACEI in early period of acute MI might be dangerous because hypotension induced by them can worsen blood flow and aggravate ischemic injury of the myocardium and increase dimensions of MI.", 
    "815": "Hypotensive, organoprotective, and metabolic effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor moexipril (7.5-15 mg/day for 16 weeks) with or without combination with hydrochlorothiazide was studied in 34 women (mean age 59.6+/-1.6 years) with postmenopausal metabolic syndrome and hypertension. Thirty four women had dyslipidemia, 22 -- disturbances of carbohydrate metabolism, 18 -- obesity (mean body mass index 31.1+/-0.8 kg/m(2)). Treatment was associated with lowering of office systolic(-20.1%) and diastolic (-17.4%) blood pressure (BP). Target BP (140/90 mm Hg) was achieved in 27 patients. There also occurred significant lowering of mean 24 hour, diurnal, and nocturnal systolic and diastolic BP (p<0.05), significant changes of values of systolic and diastolic BP time indexes, normalization of which was observed both during day and night hours. Significant lowering of total cholesterol (-11.6%, p<0.05), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (-16.3%, p<0.02), and in patients with obesity of triglycerides (-27%, p<0.02) was revealed at the background of treatment with moexipril. In a group as a whole we observed significant lowering of excretion of albumins and b2-microglobulin; most pronounced antiproteinuretic effect was noted in patients with high microproteinuria and obesity. Vasodilating function of vessels improved in all patients with postmenopausal metabolic syndrome, mainly at the account of increment of endothelium dependent vasodilation and normalization of index of vasodilatation.", 
    "816": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are contraindicated in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis due to risk of azotemia resulting from preferential efferent arteriolar vasodilation in the renal glomerulus due to inhibition of angiotensin II. Patients with renal artery stenosis who can derive survival benefit from ACE inhibition, therefore, may not receive ACEI therapy. We evaluated the safety of ACEI therapy in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis following successful revascularization using renal artery stenting. This study is a retrospective analysis of 25 patients who underwent bilateral renal artery stenting for refractory hypertension and had a strong clinical indication for long-term ACEI use (left ventricular dysfunction or diabetes). Eighteen of the 25 patients (72%) have been safely maintained on a target dose of ACEIs, 2 of the 25 have been treated with angiotensin receptor blockers due to cough, and 5 of the 25 are being treated with a hydralazine/nitrate combination due to cough (2 patients) or baseline renal insufficiency (3 patients). We conclude that patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses that have been successfully revascularized using renal stenting may be safely treated with long-term ACEI therapy.", 
    "817": "Food sources such as soybeans and fish contain angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides with antihypertensive properties. Methionine-tyrosine (Met-Tyr) is an ACE inhibitory dipeptide derived from sardine muscle. The present study investigates the effect of Met-Tyr on the expression of the antioxidant stress proteins, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and ferritin, in endothelial cells derived from the human umbilical vein and their contribution to the decrease in radical formation that occurs under the influence of this dipeptide. Preincubation of endothelial cells with Met-Tyr (10-300 micromol/L) followed by washout markedly diminished subsequently induced NADPH-mediated radical formation. This indirect protection was associated with a significant increase in protein expression of HO-1 and ferritin and abolished by the HO inhibitor zinc deuteroporphyrin IX 2,4-bis-ethylene glycol (ZnBG). The HO product bilirubin produced antioxidant effects comparable to those of Met-Tyr. Met-Tyr raised HO-1 mRNA levels by enhancing mRNA stability. Antioxidant effects were specific for Met-Tyr and not observed with other methionine-containing dipeptides or ACE inhibitory agents. Our results demonstrate that Met-Tyr protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress via induction of HO-1 and ferritin but independently of its ACE inhibitory properties. This pathway represents a novel, potentially antiatherogenic mechanism of Met-Tyr and dietary proteins releasing Met-Tyr during gastrointestinal digestion.", 
    "818": "Hypertension is common in children with end-stage renal disease who have undergone renal transplantation. We performed ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in renal allograft recipients who were on stable maintenance immunosuppressive medications and were more than six months post-transplant. Echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was obtained at the time of ABPM. Twenty-nine children with a mean age of 14.8 yr (8-18 yr) were evaluated 4.3 yr (0.6-12.8 yr) after deceased donor (n = 13) or living donor (n = 16) transplantation. BP levels were higher during sleep compared with when awake using the 95th percentile to standardize mean BP for each period: mean BP was expressed as a standard deviation score (SDS) for each time period, awake vs. sleep: systolic (s) BP SDS were 0.43 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.29 +/- 1.2 (p < 0.001) and diastolic (d) BP SDS were 0.04 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.34 +/- 1.2 (p < 0.001). Significant differences between awake and sleep BP were also confirmed using the mean BP for each period expressed as a BPI. Hypertension (HTN) during sleep was more common than awake HTN. Based upon BPI, 21% had sHTN when awake compared with 48% during sleep and 7% had dHTN when awake compared with 41% during sleep (p < 0.05). Based upon mean BP load, 38% had sHTN when awake compared with 55% during sleep and 21% demonstrated dHTN when awake compared with 52% during sleep (p < 0.05). Left ventricular mass (LVM) was abnormally increased in six of 17 children (35%); LVM was not correlated with BP. Children prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB) had significantly lower systolic BP compared with those on calcium channel blocking agents (CCB). Mean sSDS was -0.11 +/- 1.1 in those children on ACEi/ARB compared with 1.6 +/- 1.2 in those on CCB (p = 0.02): sSDS during sleep was significantly lower in the ACEi/ARB group compared with CCB (0.70 +/- 1.1 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.1, p = 0.04). Isolated nocturnal HTN is more common than daytime HTN among clinically stable pediatric renal allograft recipients. Detection and treatment of nocturnal HTN in pediatric allograft recipients could potentially affect graft survival.", 
    "819": "Arterial hypertension (AH) is encounted in 20-30% of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Alpha1-adrenoblockers have limited application in such patients and should be used as a first-line therapy only in those BPH patients who already receive them for BPH. In other cases AH is managed with thiaside diuretics, beta-adrenoblockers, ACE inhibitors or calcium antagonists. A drug of choice for correction of urination disorders in BPH hypertensive patients is alpha1A-adrenoblocker tamsulozin.", 
    "820": "A retrospective study was performed in 68 patients diagnosed as having idiopathic nephrotic syndrome with steroid-dependent, steroid-resistant or frequent relapse subtypes at the Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital during Jan 1996-Dec 2004. Male to female ratio was 3.3:1 and mean age (+/- SD) was 8.4 +/- 3.5 years. Mean follow up time (+/- SD) was 47.4 +/- 30.5 months. Renal biopsy was done in 60 patients, showing IgM nephropathy in 73.3%. Fifty-four patients (79.4%) received cyclophosphamide at a dose (+/- SD) of 2.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/d for 11.6 +/- 3.4 weeks. Negative proteinuria at 1 year was found in 70% and prednisolone was discontinued in 52%. Leucopenia was found in 9.2%. At last follow up, 34% of the patients were still in remission. Enalapril was prescribed in 50 patients for 12.4 +/- 10.0 months. Thirty-six patients also received cyclophosphamide. Remission at 1 year was achieved in 66% and prednisolone discontinued in 28%. Twelve patients (24%) were still in remission at last follow up. The results of 3 regimens: cyclophosphamide, enalapril, and cyclophosphamide plus enalapril were compared using chi-square test. Remission was significantly better in cyclophosphamide group (p = 0.014). Dipyridamole was prescribed in 14 patients due to thrombocytosis. Only 2 of 14 patients achieved remission although 11 patients received cyclophosphamide plus enalapril, and another 2 patients received only cyclophosphamide. Complications included hypertension (44%), cataract (40%), glaucoma (15%), short stature (17.6%), and obesity (5.9%). Recurrent infection was found in 69%, including dental caries (16.29%), urinary tract infection (14.7%), intestinal parasitic infestration (10.3%), respiratory tract infection (8.8%), and skin infection (7.4%). Chronic renal failure was found in 3 patients and portal vein thrombosis was found in 1 patient. We suggest that cyclophosphamide should be used as first line drug in difficult-to-treat nephrotic syndrome patients. Enalapril may be beneficial in some patients. Thrombocytosis may be associated with poor response to both medications. Difficult-to-treat patients also need long-term follow up and surveillance for complications due to disease and/or treatment.", 
    "821": "Pulse pressure (PP) is emerging as a major pressure predictor of cardiac disease. The study comprised 10 185 untreated patients with essential hypertension. A total of 5395 men and 4790 women 56+/-13 years old, with uncomplicated essential hypertension, after a 15-day washout period and after 6 months of antihypertensive monotherapy were included. All patients included in the final cohort were responders and had normalized their blood pressure. PP was decreased least with diuretics (-5 mm Hg) and most with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium antagonists (-15 mm Hg), followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (-12 mm Hg) alpha- and beta-blockers (-10 and -9 mm Hg), differentiating among antihypertensive classes (P<0.001). The magnitude of PP fall was related to the degree of left ventricular (LV) mass reduction (P<0.001), seen best with ARBs (r=0.42) and least with ACEIs (r=0.18). Of the antihypertensive medications used in everyday practice, PP decrease may be achieved best with ARBs and calcium antagonists, whereas diuretics confer poor response. PP was decreased least with diuretics (-5 mm Hg) and most with ARBs and calcium channel blockers (-15 mm Hg), followed by ACEI (-12 mm Hg) alpha- and beta-blockers (-10 and -9 mm Hg), differentiating among antihypertensive classes (P<0.001). Of the antihypertensive medications used in everyday practice, PP decrease may be achieved best with ARBs and calcium antagonists.", 
    "822": "The incidence of diabetes among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is increasing. Despite advances in therapy for CHF, mortality remains about 30% higher for diabetics with CHF than non-diabetics. Multiple mechanisms are responsible for development of CHF in diabetes with ischemic heart disease and its attendant complication of left ventricular dysfunction playing a major role. The prevalence of diabetes is rising worldwide. Thus in the foreseeable future, it appears that physicians will have to deal with increasing numbers of subjects with diabetes, coronary disease and heart failure. Management of diabetes and co-morbid conditions plays a vital role in the prevention of development CHF in subjects with diabetes. Treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and management of CHF has been evolving over last few years with major clinical trials advancing our knowledge. This review highlights some of the new developments in this field."
