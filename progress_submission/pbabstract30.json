The surviving persons (n = 339) were re-examined in 2003. Of them 85% (n = 289) were home-dwelling and 15% (n = 50) lived in institutional care. Data on their use of medication and their physical and mental health was collected from interviews conducted by trained nurses.", 
    "2": "From 1998 to 2003 regular use of one or more cardiovascular medicine increased from 80% to 87% among all the survivors (n = 339, P < 0.001). The mean number of regularly used cardiovascular medicines increased from 2.1 (95% CI 1.9-2.3) to 2.7 (95% CI 2.5-2.9, P < 0.001) during the follow-up period. The most commonly used cardiovascular medicines were beta-blocking agents. The proportion of users of beta-blocking agents was in 1998 45% and in 2003 51%. The proportion of users of diuretics increased from 27% to 40% (P < 0.001), users of cardiac therapy from 35% to 43% (P < 0.001), users of ACE inhibitors and AT 1 receptor antagonists from 20% to 30% (P < 0.001) and users of lipid modifying agents from 7% to 12%.",

    "4": "The metabolic syndrome (MS), a cluster of metabolic abnormalities with insulin resistance as its central component, is increasing in prevalence and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Current evidence supports an aggressive intervention approach that comprises lifestyle modification in conjunction with drug treatment of the MS components. Healthier eating and regular exercise greatly reduce waistline and body mass index, lower blood pressure and improve lipid profile. Lifestyle modification has been proven to prevent T2DM development. Nevertheless, appropriate treatment of MS components often requires pharmacologic intervention with insulin-sensitizing agents, such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, while statins and fibrates, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are the first-line lipid-modifying or antihypertensive drugs. Only severely obese patients require specific drug treatments. Very often, drug combinations will be necessary to manage multiple risk factors. As we progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the MS, new targets for therapies will probably be identified and new treatments will prove to be even more efficacious than those currently available for the management of this life-threatening condition.", 
    "5": "The pathophysiology of essential hypertension and its complications has been a focus of much research and clinical interest. More recent attention has been directed towards inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, especially since inflammation can promote endothelial dysfunction and the latter has been intimately related to thrombogenesis and atherogenesis. Hypertension is also associated with a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state, and this may contribute to the observation that despite the blood vessels being exposed to high pressures in hypertension the common complications of the latter are paradoxically thrombotic rather than hemorrhagic--the so-called 'thrombotic paradox of hypertension' (or 'Birmingham paradox'). Despite these thrombotic complications, the role of antithrombotic therapy for primary prevention in hypertension is less defined, unless the patient is at significant risk of cardiovascular events or has renal impairment. Antithrombotic therapy for secondary prevention in hypertension is recommended, but unanswered questions regarding the interactions between aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remain.", 
    "6": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) growth plays a key role in the pathophysiology of vascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling gene transcription in VSMC remain poorly understood. We previously identified, by differential display, a new gene (6A3-5) overexpressed in proliferating rat VSMC. In this study, we have cloned the full-length cDNA by screening a rat foetal brain cDNA library and investigated its functions. The 6A3-5 protein shows 4 putative conserved functional motifs: a DNA binding domain called ARID (AT-rich interaction domain), two recently described motifs (Osa Homology Domain), and a nuclear localization signal. The deduced protein sequence was observed to be 85% identical to the recently described human Osa2 gene. Immunolabelling, using an anti-6A3-5/Osa2 monoclonal antibody, showed a nuclear localization of the 6A3-5/Osa2 protein. In addition, PDGF upregulated 6A3-5/Osa2 expression at both the transcript and protein levels in a dose and time-dependent fashion. The pattern of upregulation by PDGF was reminiscent of the early responsive gene c-fos. The PDGF-induced upregulation of 6A3-5/Osa2 and proliferation of VSMC were significantly inhibited in a dose and sequence-dependent fashion by an antisense, but not by sense, scrambled or mismatched oligonucleotides directed against 6A3-5/Osa2. In VSMC of aortas derived from hypertensive (LH) rats, 6A3-5/Osa2 is overexpressed as compared to that in normotensive (LL) rats. The 6A3-5/Osa2-gene expression is downregulated by an ACE inhibitor and upregulated by exogenous AngiotensinII in LH rats. In summary, these results indicate that 6A3-5/Osa2 is an early activated gene that belongs to a new family of proteins involved in the control of VSMC growth.",

    "19": "For half a century, controlled hypotension has been used to reduce bleeding and the need for blood transfusions, and provide a satisfactory bloodless surgical field. It has been indicated in oromaxillofacial surgery (mandibular osteotomy, facial repair), endoscopic sinus or middle ear microsurgery, spinal surgery and other neurosurgery (aneurysm), major orthopaedic surgery (hip or knee replacement, spinal), prostatectomy, cardiovascular surgery and liver transplant surgery. Controlled hypotension is defined as a reduction of the systolic blood pressure to 80-90 mm Hg, a reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 50-65 mm Hg or a 30% reduction of baseline MAP. Pharmacological agents used for controlled hypotension include those agents that can be used successfully alone and those that are used adjunctively to limit dosage requirements and, therefore, the adverse effects of the other agents. Agents used successfully alone include inhalation anaesthetics, sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, trimethaphan camsilate, alprostadil (prostaglandin E1), adenosine, remifentanil, and agents used in spinal anaesthesia. Agents that can be used alone or in combination include calcium channel antagonists (e.g. nicardipine), beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) [e.g. propranolol, esmolol] and fenoldopam. Agents that are mainly used adjunctively include ACE inhibitors and clonidine. New agents and techniques have been recently evaluated for their ability to induce effective hypotension without impairing the perfusion of vital organs. This development has been aided by new knowledge on the physiology of peripheral microcirculatory regulation. Apart from the adverse effects of major hypotension on the perfusion of vital organs, potent hypotensive agents have their own adverse effects depending on their concentration, which can be reduced by adjuvant treatment. Care with use limits the major risks of these agents in controlled hypotension; risks that are generally less important than those of transfusion or alternatives to transfusion. New hypotensive drugs, such as fenoldopam, adenosine and alprostadil, are currently being evaluated; however, they have disadvantages and a high treatment cost that limits their development in this indication. New techniques of controlled hypotension subscribe to the use of the natural hypotensive effect of the anaesthetic drug with regard to the definition of the ideal hypotensive agent. It must be easy to administer, have a short onset time, an effect that disappears quickly when administration is discontinued, a rapid elimination without toxic metabolites, negligible effects on vital organs, and a predictable and dose-dependent effect. Inhalation agents (isoflurane, sevoflurane) provide the benefit of being hypnotic and hypotensive agents at clinical concentrations, and are used alone or in combination with adjuvant agents to limit tachycardia and rebound hypertension, for example, inhibitors of the autonomic nervous system (clonidine, beta-blockers) or ACE inhibitors. When they are used alone, inhalation anaesthetics require high concentrations for a significant reduction in bleeding that can lead to hepatic or renal injury. The greatest efficacy and ease-of-use to toxicity ratio is for techniques of anaesthesia that associate analgesia and hypotension at clinical concentrations without the need for potent hypotensive agents. The first and oldest technique is epidural anaesthesia, but depending on the surgery, it is not always appropriate. The most recent satisfactory technique is a combination treatment of remifentanil with either propofol or an inhalation agent (isoflurane, desflurane or sevoflurane) at clinical concentrations. In light of the current literature, and because of their safety and ease of use, these two techniques are preferred.", 
    "20": "Diabetes mellitus affects about 8% of the adult population. The estimated number of patients with diabetes, presently about 170 million people, is expected to increase by 50-70% within the next 25 years. Diabetes is an important component of the complex of 'common' cardiovascular risk factors, and is responsible for acceleration and worsening of atherothrombosis. Major cardiovascular events cause about 80% of the total mortality in diabetic patients. Diabetes also induces peculiar microangiopathic changes leading to diabetic nephropathy conducive to end-stage renal failure, and to diabetic retinopathy that may progress to vision loss and blindness. In terms of major cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Peripheral arterial disease frequently occurs, and is more likely to be conducive to critical limb ischaemia and amputation than in the absence of diabetes. Although there are a number of differences in the pathogenesis and clinical features of diabetic macroangiopathy and microangiopathy, these two entities often coexist and induce mutually worsening effects. Endothelial injury, dysfunction and damage are common starting points for both conditions. Causes of endothelial injury can be distinguished into those 'common' to nondiabetic atherothrombosis, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, hypercoagulability and platelet activation; and those more specific and in some cases 'unique' to diabetes and directly related to the metabolic derangement of the disease, such as (i) desulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of the vascular matrix; (ii) formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) and their endothelial receptors (RAGE); (iii) oxidative and reductive stress; (iv) decline in nitric oxide production; (v) activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS); and (vi) endothelial inflammation caused by glucose, insulin, insulin precursors and AGE/RAGE. Prevention of major cardiovascular events with the antithrombotic agent aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is widely recommended, but reportedly underutilised in patients with diabetes. However, some data suggest that aspirin may be less effective than expected in preventing cardiovascular events and especially mortality in patients with diabetes, as well as in slowing progression of retinopathy. In contrast, a recent study found picotamide, a direct thromboxane inhibitor, to be superior to aspirin in diabetic patients. Clopidogrel was either equivalent or less active in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients, depending upon different clinical settings.Recent studies have shown that some GAG compounds are able to reduce micro- and macroalbuminuria in diabetic nephropathy, and hard exudates in diabetic retinopathy, but it is as yet unknown whether these agents also influence the natural history of microvascular complications of diabetes. Lifestyle changes and physical exercise are also essential in preventing cardiovascular events in diabetic patients. Available data on the control of the metabolic state and the main risk factors show that careful adjustment of blood sugar and glycated haemoglobin is more effective in counteracting microvascular damage than in preventing major cardiovascular events. The latter objective requires a more comprehensive approach to the whole constellation of risk factors both specific for diabetes and common to atherothrombosis. This approach includes lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and smoking cessation and the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which are able to correct the lipid status and to prevent major cardiovascular events independently of the baseline lipidaemic or cardiovascular status. Tight control of hypertension is essential to reduce not only major cardiovascular events but also microvascular complications. Among antihypertensive measures, blockade of the RAAS by means of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists recently emerged as a potentially polyvalent approach, not only for treating hypertension and reducing cardiovascular events, but also to prevent or reduce albuminuria, counteract diabetic nephropathy and lower the occurrence of new type 2 diabetes in individuals at risk.", 
    "21": "Hypertension is the major risk factor for ischaemic and haemorrhagic clinical strokes as well as for silent brain infarcts with a continuous association between both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Epidemiological data highlight the increasing burden to come over the next decades. Without any doubt, antihypertensive treatment is the most important therapy to reduce the risk of stroke by approximately 30-40%. International guidelines recommend antihypertensive treatment for primary prevention with evidence level A. Recurrent strokes or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are an important practical, clinical and economic problem, and have a major impact on the development of vascular dementia. All stroke patients and patients with TIA have to be regarded as very high-risk patients. Hypertension increases the risk of recurrent strokes. Only limited data directly address the role of blood pressure treatment among individuals with stroke or TIA. There is a general lack of definitive data regarding when to start antihypertensive treatment in the initial phase, and treatment of hypertension in the acute period after stroke is still under debate. Experimental and clinical data suggest that reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) may have beneficial effects beyond the lowering of blood pressure. There is increasing evidence of cerebroprotective effects for medication influencing the RAAS, such as angiotensin receptor antagonists or ACE inhibitors. The MOSES study showed for the first time superiority of an angiotensin receptor antagonist compared with a calcium channel antagonist in antihypertensive treatment for secondary stroke prevention. Optimal blood pressure range in secondary prevention seems to be 120-140/80-90 mm Hg, but questions about a J- or U-shaped curve are still not answered sufficiently. The effects of additional antihypertensive treatment in the evening for stroke patients with 'non-dipping' blood pressure need to be investigated.Currently, the most important goal in primary and secondary prevention of stroke is a strict normotensive blood pressure control. Antihypertensive treatment is recommended for both prevention of recurrent stroke and prevention of other vascular events in individuals who have had an ischaemic stroke or TIA (class I, level of evidence A). Many open questions remain and funding of stroke research needs to be increased in the near future.", 
    "22": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) has powerful sodium-retaining, growth-promoting and pro- inflammatory properties in addition to its physiological role in maintaining body salt and fluid balance and blood pressure homeostasis. Increased circulating and local tissue Ang II is one of the most important factors contributing to the development of sodium and fluid retention, hypertension and target organ damage. The importance of Ang II in the pathogenesis of hypertension and target organ injury is best demonstrated by the effectiveness of angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists in treating hypertension and progressive renal disease including diabetic nephropathy. The detrimental effects of Ang II are mediated primarily by the AT1-receptor, while the AT2-receptor may oppose the AT1-receptor. The classical view of the AT1-receptor-mediated effects of Ang II is that the agonist binds its receptors at the cell surface, and following receptor phosphorylation, activates downstream signal transduction pathways and intracellular responses. However, evidence is emerging that binding of Ang II to its cell surface AT1-receptors also activates endocytotic (or internalisation) processes that promote trafficking of both the effector and the receptor into intracellular compartments. Whether internalised Ang II has important intracrine and signalling actions is not well understood. The purpose of this article is to review recent advances in Ang II research with focus on the mechanisms underlying high levels of intracellular Ang II in proximal tubule cells and the contribution of receptor-mediated endocytosis of extracellular Ang II. Further attention is devoted to the question whether intracellular and/or internalised Ang II plays a physiological role by activating cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors in proximal tubule cells. This information may aid future development of drugs to prevent and treat Ang II-induced target organ injury in cardiovascular and renal diseases by blocking intracellular and/or nuclear actions of Ang II.", 
    "23": "A number of large randomised controlled trials have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, compared with placebo or other blood pressure-lowering drugs, improve coronary heart disease outcomes (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularisation) in diverse patient groups, e.g. in primary and secondary prevention, those with and without left ventricular dysfunction, and among hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects. An updated meta-regression analysis which included five major trials in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) (EUROPA, INVEST, ACTION, PEACE and CAMELOT) concluded that ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy has clear benefits in secondary prevention, but there are important and unexplained differences between trials in clinical outcome, baseline cardiovascular risk, blood pressure changes and trial design which deserve further discussion of the underlying mechanisms and clinical interpretation. For example, in placebo-controlled trials the biggest (2022%) reductions in primary end points (including mortality) have been observed with perindopril and ramipril, whereas trials using trandolapril and quinapril had no effect on survival or recurrent CAD events. This review summarises and compares the major findings of these recent trials, and provides further analysis of the underlying mechanisms and clinical significance of secondary CAD prevention with ACE-I therapy.",

Mean lisinopril starting and final doses were 0.105 mg/kg/day for hypertensive patients and 0.108 mg/kg/day for patients with renal disease, respectively. The most common adverse event was hypotension (8.6% of the patients). Haematology and serum biochemistry profiles were unaffected by lisinopril. Growth was not different from data recorded by Belgian population studies.

In contrast these drugs have no effect on HAE. Replacement therapy with C1-INH has proved to be effective. The challenge is to realize whether an airway obstruction is due to HAE or not. In this case, careful observation, the right medication and an appropriate airway management are lifesaving.

The clinical features are variable because patients may be asymptomatic despite there being evidence of severe left ventricular dysfunction. Although the mechanism of alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy is not clearly understood, abstinence from alcohol has been associated with improvement in left ventricular function. Conversely, patients with ongoing alcohol abuse and dilated cardiomyopathy have a poor prognosis, with progressive biventricular failure and, ultimately, death.

The objective of this study was to find the effects of short-term treatment of carvedilol on patients with ischemic LV systolic dysfunction (defined as LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <or=30% on 2D echocardiography) undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). There were 74 patients that received ACE inhibitor without any beta-blocker (control) and 67 patients that received carvedilol in addition to ACE inhibitor following CABG (carvedilol group). After 1 month of drug administration following CABG, the control group was found to have significantly greater percent improvement in LVEF (29.1% +/- 5.39%) as compared with the carvedilol group (15.3% +/- 4.89%). However, after 3 and 6 months, LVEF levels were found to be significantly greater in the carvedilol group as compared with the control group. Further, at 6 months of drug administration, LV end systolic diameter was significantly less in the carvedilol group (39.11 +/- 1.10 mm) as compared with the control group (43.49 +/- 1.39 mm). Thus, carvedilol produces beneficial effect on short-term administration in terms of LV contractility when given along with ACE inhibitor as compared with ACE inhibitor therapy alone.",

However, the rates of discontinuation increased significantly during follow-up and, in men, reached 27% by 2 years and 42% by 5 years for beta-blockers. The rates of discontinuation of all four study drugs had a parabolic shape with the youngest and oldest patients having the highest rates.",

    "39": "Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitors comprise some of the most commonly used medications in coronary artery disease (CAD) and its related syndromes. Unfortunately, significant inter-patient variability seems likely in response to these agents; of which, the influence of genetic determinants is of interest. This review summarizes the available RAS inhibitor pharmacogenomic studies which have evaluated RAS polymorphisms that either elucidate mechanism via surrogate endpoint measurements, or predict efficacy via clinical outcomes in CAD related syndromes.Regardless of the endpoint, none of the RAS genotypes conclusively predicts efficacy of RAS inhibitors. In fact, the results of the pharmacogenomic studies were often in direct conflict with one another. Varied results appear due to methodological limitations (e.g., inadequate study power, genotyping error, methods of endpoint measurement), study conceptualization (e.g., overestimating the contribution of polymorphism to disease, lack of haplotype approach), and differences between studies (e.g., genotype frequency, study subject characteristics, the specific medication and dose used). Thus investigators should consider the various methodological limitations to improve upon the current approach to RAS inhibitor pharmacogenomic research in the vast CAD population.", 
    "40": "This review reflects both the variable presentation and the systemic nature of preeclampsia. Recommendations for the comprehensive evaluation and management of organ dysfunction associated with pre-eclampsia are included. The main points in the review are that: (1) Preeclampsia is a systemic disorder that may affect many organ systems. (2) For preeclampsia remote from term (<34 weeks), expectant management improves perinatal outcomes, but requires obsessive surveillance to mitigate maternal risks and is a \"package.\" (3) Initial assessment and ongoing surveillance of women with preeclampsia should include assessment of all vulnerable maternal organs as well as of the fetus. (4) Initiate antihypertensive drug treatment immediately if sBP >160 mmHg or dBP more than 110 mmHg, or if sBP 140-159 mmHg and/or dBP 85-109 mmHg (prepregnancy renal disease or diabetes). (5) The treatment of nonsevere pregnancy hypertension should include a treatment goal of dBP 80-105 mmHg (depending on practitioner preference), with one of the following agents, Methyldopa, Labetalol, Nifedipine, or, with special indications (renal or cardiac diseases), diuretics. (6) Drugs to avoid: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; angiotensin II receptor antagonists; and atenolol. (7) For the acute management of severe hypertension, initially reduce dBP by 10 mmHg and maintain the blood pressure at or below that level with either Nifedipine or Labetalol. (8) For both prophylaxis against and treatment of eclampsia, MgSO4 (4 g IV stat, then 1 g/hr). (9) For recurrent seizures, MgSO4 (2g IV stat, then increase to 1.5 g/hr). (10) Total fluid intake should not exceed 80 ml/hr; tolerate urine outputs as low as 10 ml/hr. (11) Early-onset and/or severe preeclampsia predict later cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; it would seem prudent to offer such women screening and lipid lowering interventions.", 
    "41": "A review of six clinical trials of aliskiren involving >5,000 patients with mild to moderate hypertension indicated that this first of a new class of orally active antihypertensive drugs is no more effective than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or diuretics for lowering blood pressure. The starting dose is 150 mg; 300 mg is usually more effective, but 600 mg is no better than 300 mg. Aliskiren in combination with a diuretic appeared to lower blood pressure more than an aliskiren-ARB combination, but still failed to control blood pressure (<140/90) in 50% of the patients. Although aliskiren suppresses plasma renin activity, it causes much greater reactive rises in plasma renin concentration than does any other antihypertensive class tested. Because aliskiren, like CEIs and ARBs, only blocks 90% to 95% of plasma renin, the pressor consequences of its greater reactive increases in plasma renin concentration appear to offset its net ability to lower blood pressure, especially with higher doses. Patients with hyperreactive renin systems (renovascular, advanced, and malignant hypertension) were excluded from all of the trials.

Echocardiography was used less often for diagnosis in rural towns compared with metropolitan areas (52.0% v 67.3%, P < 0.001). Rates of specialist referral were also significantly lower in rural towns than in metropolitan areas (59.1% v 69.6%, P < 0.001), as were prescribing rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (51.4% v 60.1%, P < 0.001). There was no geographical variation in prescribing rates of beta-blockers (12.6% [rural] v 11.8% [metropolitan], P = 0.32).

We investigated the effects of continuous administration of colors from purple corn (PCC), purple sweet potato (PSC) and red radish (RRC) to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). These are rich in anthocyanins. Animals were fed with diets containing PCC, PSC or RRC (1 mass% of diets) for 15 wk. While the body weight and the daily food intake of administered rats were not different from those of the non-administered control rats through the experimental period, the blood pressure and the heart rate of SHR administered each color decreased as compared to the control group from the early stage of administration. These results suggest that plant-derived colors containing anthocyanins have anti-hypertensive effects on hypertensive animals.", 
    "49": "Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). Recurrent UTI in the presence of the VUR is believed to cause renal scarring, which carries a risk of subsequent hypertension, toxemia of pregnancy, and significant renal damage, including end-stage renal disease. The natural history of VUR is to improve or resolve completely with time in most of the patients. The traditional management consists of prompt treatment of UTI, long-term anti-microbial prophylaxis until the VUR resolves, or surgical intervention in those with persistent high grade VUR, recurrent UTI in spite of prophylaxis with anti-microbial agent, allergy to anti-microbial agents, and patient/parent non-compliance with the medical management. Voiding dysfunction and constipation play an important role, and their diagnosis and appropriate management helps reduce the frequency of UTI and promote the resolution of the VUR. Patients with renal scarring need to be monitored for potential complications such as hypertension, proteinuria, and progression of the renal damage. In patients with hypertension and/or proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are the drugs of choice, because of their reno-protective properties. Recent studies have revealed that there is no convincing evidence that UTI in the presence of VUR predicts renal injury or that the use of long-term anti-microbial prophylaxis or surgical intervention prevents renal scarring or its progression. However, until proven otherwise by a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized study, it is advisable to err on the side of caution and consider VUR and UTI risk factors for renal scarring and treat each patient on individual basis.", 
    "50": "Hypertension is a leading risk factor for vascular dementia. With the increasing burden of dementia, prevention and delay of cognitive decline are becoming a priority. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that patients taking antihypertensive medications have a reduced incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers appear to offer significant neuroprotection, even beyond blood pressure reduction. Evidence is emerging that the angiotensin receptor blockers offer superior neuroprotection. This finding has been attributed to the unique property of sustained blockade of the AT1 receptor, combined with simultaneous activation of the AT2 receptors. The use of angiotensin receptor blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension and cognitive protection in the elderly should be strongly considered.",

Ramipril, candesartan, or combination therapy reduced blood pressure, improved flow-mediated dilation, and increased plasma adiponectin levels when compared with baseline values. However, combination therapy improved these outcome measures to a greater extent than either ramipril or candesartan alone (P < 0.001 and P = 0.016 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, P < 0.001 and P = 0.048 for flow-mediated dilation and adiponectin levels by ANOVA).

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (+/-15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (+/-15), 83.71 (+/-19), and 42.36 (+/-11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 microl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from alpha-, beta-, and kappa-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to beta-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to alpha(s1)-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to beta-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to beta-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to beta-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 microM to 790 microM.

In order to get the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), especially for analysis of fosinopril, key points of the method have been investigated including chromatographic conditions and selection of LC-MS/MS conditions. The analytes were extracted from plasma samples by liquid-liquid extraction, separated on a reversed-phase C(8) column using gradient procedure, and detected by tandem mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole ionization interface. The analytes and internal standard zaleplon were detected using positive electrospray ionization (ESI) in the SRM mode. The LLOQ of the method down to 0.1 ng mL(-1) for fosinopril and 1.0 ng mL(-1) for fosinoprilat were identifiable and reproducible. The standard calibration curves for both fosinopril and fosinoprilat were linear over the ranges of 0.1-15.0 and 1.0-700 ng mL(-1) in human plasma, respectively.

When clinical trials conducted with zofenopril began with a vast study program called SMILE, certain questions remained unanswered, notably the long-term benefit of the ACE inhibitors beyond a short administration period. SMILE (Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-Term Evaluation), begun in 1995, is studying zofenopril to determine the effects of using this ACE inhibitor in the follow-up of myocardial infarction. During the course of the different study phases, zofenopril has successively demonstrated benefits on the reduction of morbidity and mortality after anterior myocardial infarction in STEMI patients, benefits that are maintained over the long term, since at 1 year, the mortality rate is significantly lower in the zofenopril group compared to the placebo group. SMILE's analyses have shown the value of zofenopril in subpopulations, particularly at-risk patients, hypertensive patients, and diabetics, whose prognosis after infarction is more severe than in populations without hypertension or diabetes. Zofenopril can be administered early, even in a more favorable situation, to myocardial infarction patients with no ST-segment elevation (NSTEMI). The SMILE program is continuing, notably with SMILE IV, where it is being compared to ramipril, and in the ZAAMIS trial, designed to confirm its vasculoprotective effects.",

VEGF levels in conditioned media of HS766T and PK9 PDA cells treated with or without AngII (10(-7) mol/L) were measured by ELISA.

ACE protein collocalized with AT1R and VEGF in the malignant ducts and in the stromal cells. Addition of AngII significantly enhanced VEGF mRNA production and protein secretion, an effect that was prevented when cells were preincubated with captopril or losartan. Blocking endogenous AngII by captopril or losartan significantly suppressed cell proliferation.",

    "66": "To evaluate current compliance with recommendations for medical therapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the relation between previous revascularization and use of guideline-recommended therapies was investigated. From 5,400 outpatient practices in 44 countries, we compared baseline characteristics and medical therapy of 40,450 patients with documented CAD (all with previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], or angina pectoris) by previous revascularization status. Approximately 33% of patients had previous CABG, 33% had previous PCI, and 33% had no previous revascularization. Patients with previous CABG were older and often men and diabetic. Patients with previous PCI were the youngest. Guideline-recommended medical therapy use was significantly higher in those with previous revascularization. Antiplatelet therapy in medically managed patients was 80% versus 86% and 91% for those with previous CABG or PCI, respectively. Use of any lipid-lowering agent in those with previous CABG or PCI was 86% in the 2 groups versus 70% in patients who were medically managed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers were used in similar ratios among groups. Previous revascularization appears to be associated with better use of guideline-recommended medical treatment. These trends were similar for patients from the United States versus everywhere else. In conclusion, use of evidence-based, guideline-recommended therapies in outpatients with CAD needs to improve, especially in medically managed patients.", 
    "67": "The prognostic effect of beta-blocker treatment on ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) is controversially discussed in the era of reperfusion therapy. From the German multicenter registry Maximal Individual Therapy of Acute Myocardial Infarction PLUS (MITRA PLUS), 17,809 consecutive patients with STEMI treated with a guideline-recommended therapy with aspirin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were investigated; the prognostic effect of additional acute beta-blocker treatment was analyzed. Patients with cardiogenic shock were excluded. Of included patients, 77.6% received additional acute beta-blocker treatment and 22.4% did not. Patients with beta-blocker treatment were younger and more often received reperfusion therapy. Acute beta-blocker treatment was associated with a lower hospital mortality (univariate analysis 4.9% vs 10.8%, p <0.001; multivariate analysis odds ratio [OR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 0.81). Acute beta blockade was significantly associated with a lower hospital mortality in patients without (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.79) and with (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98) reperfusion therapy. The greatest benefit of acute beta-blocker treatment, measured by the number needed to treat to save 1 life, was found in patients with anterior MI, a heart rate > or =80 beats/min, no reperfusion therapy, female gender, and age > or =65 years. In conclusion, acute beta-blocker therapy in the clinical practice of treating patients with STEMI, in addition to aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, was independently associated with a significant decrease in hospital mortality in patients with and without reperfusion therapy. High-risk patients with STEMI, such as elderly patients and patients without reperfusion therapy, showed a greater benefit of acute beta-blocker therapy than low-risk patients with STEMI.", 
    "68": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were developed based on proline-rich oligopeptides found in the venom of Bothrops jararaca (Bj) previously known as bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs). However, the exact mechanism of action of BPPs remains unclear. The role of the ACE in the cardiovascular effects of two of naturally proline-rich oligopeptides (Bj-BPP-7a and Bj-BPP-10c) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Bj-BPP-7a does not potentiate the cardiovascular response to bradykinin and is a weak inhibitor of ACE C and N sites (K(i) = 40,000 and 70,000 nM, respectively), whereas Bj-BPP-10c is a strong bradykinin potentiator and inhibitor of the ACE C site (K(i) = 0.5 versus 200 nM for N site). Strikingly, both peptides, in doses ranging from 0.47 to 71 nmol/kg, produced long-lasting reduction (>6 h) in the mean arterial pressure of conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (maximal change, 45 +/- 6 and 53 +/- 6 mm Hg for Bj-BPP-7a and Bj-BPP-10c, respectively). The fall in blood pressure was accompanied by variable degrees of bradycardia. In keeping with the absence of relationship between ACE-inhibitory and antihypertensive activities, no changes in the pressor effect of angiotensin I or in the hypotensive effect of bradykinin were observed at the peak of the cardiovascular effects of both peptides. Our results indicate that the antihypertensive effect of two Bj-BPPs containing the motif Ile-Pro-Pro is unrelated to their ability for inhibiting ACE or potentiating bradykinin (BK), indicating as a major component ACE and BK-independent mechanisms. These results are in line with previous observations suggesting ACE inhibition-independent mechanisms for angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "69": "Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at increased risk for ESRD and cardiovascular events. The primary objective was to assess the association between ankle-brachial index (ABI) values and renal outcome. The secondary objective was to evaluate whether statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are associated with improved renal and cardiovascular outcome in patients with PAD. In a prospective observational cohort study of 1940 consecutive patients with PAD, ABI was measured and chronic statin and ACEI therapy was noted at baseline. Serial creatinine concentrations were obtained at baseline, 6 mo, and every year after enrollment. End points were ESRD, all-cause mortality, and cardiac events during a median follow-up period of 8 yr. Baseline estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) was assessed in 27% of patients. ESRD, all-cause mortality, and cardiac events occurred in 10, 46, and 31% of patients, respectively. In multivariate analysis, a lower baseline ABI was significantly associated with a higher progression rate of ESRD (hazard ratio [HR] per 0.10 decrease 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21 to 1.49). Chronic use of statins and ACEI were significantly associated with lower ESRD (HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.28 to 0.63] and 0.74 [95% CI 0.54 to 0.98], respectively), mortality (HR 0.66; [95% CI 0.55 to 0.82] and 0.84 [95% CI 78 to 0.95], respectively), and cardiac events (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.56 to 0.91] and 0.81 [95% CI 0.68 to 0.96], respectively). In patients with PAD, low ABI values independently predict the onset of ESRD. Less progression toward ESRD and improved cardiovascular outcome was observed among patients who were on long-term statins and ACEI.", 
    "70": "It is unclear whether patients with nondiabetic kidney disease benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy when they are at low risk for disease progression or when they have low urinary protein excretion. With the use of a combined database from 11 randomized, clinical trials (n = 1860), a Cox proportional hazards model, based on known predictors of risk and the composite outcome kidney failure or creatinine doubling, was developed and used to stratify patients into equal-sized quartiles of risk. Outcome risk and treatment effect were examined across various risk strata. Use of this risk model for targeting ACEI therapy was also compared with a strategy based on urinary protein excretion alone. Control patients in the highest quartile of predicted risk had an annualized outcome rate of 28.7%, whereas control patients in the lowest quartile of predicted risk had an annualized outcome rate of 0.4%. Despite the extreme variation in risk, there was no variation in the degree of benefit of ACEI therapy (P = 0.93 for the treatment x risk interaction). Significant interaction was detected between baseline urine protein and ACEI therapy (P = 0.003). When patients were stratified according to their baseline urinary protein excretion, among the subgroup of patients with proteinuria > or =500 mg/d, significant treatment effect was seen across all patients with a measurable outcome risk, including those at relatively low risk (1.7% annualized risk for progression). However, there was no benefit of ACEI therapy among patients with proteinuria <500 mg/d, even among higher risk patients (control outcome rate 19.7%). Patients with nondiabetic kidney disease vary considerably in their risk for disease progression, but the treatment effect of ACEI does not vary across risk strata. Patients with proteinuria <500 mg/d do not seem to benefit, even when at relatively high risk for progression.", 
    "71": "The properties of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have largely been attributed to a class effect. However, this opinion is now increasingly challenged in view of the findings from recent clinical trials, which have demonstrated differential effects of ACE inhibitors, in particular with respect to secondary cardiovascular prevention outcomes. In this experimental study, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with five different ACE inhibitors (enalapril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril) at equihypotensive doses. All ACE inhibitors increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and activity in the aorta (both P<0.0001 versus vehicle) and in cardiac myocytes (both P<0.05 versus vehicle). A highly significant effect was observed with perindopril when compared with vehicle in the modulation of eNOS protein expression and activity in aorta (22.52+/-1.09 versus 9.12+/-0.57 AU microg(-1) protein and 1.59+/-0.03 versus 0.77+/-0.02 pmol l(-1) citrulline min(-1)mg protein(-1), respectively) and in cardiac myocytes (17.64+/-0.94 versus 11.30+/-0.59 AU microg(-1) protein and 0.93+/-0.02 versus 0.62+/-0.03 pmol l(-1) citrulline min(-1)mg protein(-1), respectively). On the basis of the eNOS protein expression in the rat aorta, the other ACE inhibitors had similar, but lower effects. Indeed, the rank of potency - based both on eNOS protein expression and activity - was perindopril>trandolapril approximately quinapril approximately ramipril approximately enalapril (P<0.05 perindopril versus trandolapril and ramipril and P<0.01 perindopril versus enalapril, respectively). Levels of circulating nitrite/nitrate, the end-metabolites of nitric oxide, were also significantly affected by ACE inhibition, with the same order of potency. Our findings provide further evidence in favor of differential effects associated with ACE inhibitor therapy and suggest that the clinical benefits associated with these drugs may not solely reflect a class effect extending their benefit beyond blood pressure-lowering effect.",

Although most of the methods available in the literature were analyses of plasma or serum, assays of blood and urine were also included. Additionally, sample pretreatment methods, separation conditions and ionization modes were overviewed. Some information on chemical structures, cis-trans izomerization and stability of compounds in question was also included.

    "73": "The development of atrial fibrillation ablation has revolutionized the field of antiarrhythmic treatment by reducing the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) significantly in patients with paroxysmal atrium fibrillation (PAF). However, the effect of ablation on the patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF) is not as good as it on PAF. Although doctors have created a series of ablation strategy, they still cannot treat PeAF effectively. This phenomenon is caused by structural remodeling and electrical remodeling of atrium during the long period of AF. Many experimental have demonstrated remodeling of atrium correlated with high level of angiotensin in atrial tissue, and blockade of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) through angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can reverse atrial remodeling. Clinical studies also confirmed that blockade of RAS can prevent AF effectively. Thus, for the object of treating PeAF effectively, we can combine the circumferential pulmonary vein isolation with blockade of RAS treatment, this combined strategy eliminate the trigger (pulmonary vein potential ) of AF and reverse the atrial remodeling, may be have a good effect on PeAF.", 
    "74": "Hypertension and type-2 diabetes are frequently observed concomitantly in a same patient. There are possibilities to delay the onset of type-2 diabetes, especially in patients already managed for hypertension. Trials on renin-angiotensin blockers show that compared to other drug therapies, there is a lower incidence of diabetes in patients treated by an ACE-inhibitor or an Angiotensin 11 antagonist and the benefit can be estimated at 22% (relative risk at 0.78 with a confidence interval from 0.74 to 0.83). A higher risk of occurrence of type-2 diabetes is particularly noted in those under beta-blocking therapy combined to diuretics. In ALLHAT, the comparison of a thiazide diuretic, an ACE-inhibitor and a calcium antagonist showed that the incidence of new cases of diabetes was the highest in the diuretic group and the lowest in the ACE-inhibitor group. Hypertensive patients under calcium antagonists presented an incidence in between the two other groups. According to a recent hypothesis, the insulin-resistance decrease as a consequence of renin-angiotensin system blocking is related to the recruitment of pre-adipocytes. The NAVIGATOR and ONTARGET trials will probably confirm the preliminary results obtained in this topic. Their results are expected within the 2 next years.", 
    "75": "ACE2 appears to counterbalance the vasopressor effect of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) in the reninangiotensin system. We hypothesized that ACE2 polymorphisms could confer a high risk of hypertension and have an impact on the antihypertensive response to ACE inhibitors. The hypothesis was tested in two casecontrol studies and a clinical trial of 3,408 untreated hypertensive patients randomized to Atenolol, Hydrochlorothiazide, Captopril, or Nifedipine treatments for 4 weeks. ACE2 rs2106809 T allele was found to confer a 1.6-fold risk for hypertension in women (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.132.06), whereas when combined with the effect of the ACE DD genotype, the risk was 2.34-fold (95% CI, 1.754.85) in two independent samples. The adjusted diastolic blood pressure response to Captopril was 3.3 mm Hg lower in ACE2 T allele carriers than in CC genotype carriers (P=0.019) in women. We conclude that the ACE2 T allele confers a high risk for hypertension and reduced antihypertensive response to ACE inhibitors.",

Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) >or=140/90 mm Hg in subjects with no other risk factors or >or=130/80 mm Hg in subjects with diabetes or kidney disease. Trandolapril therapy was initiated at 1 mg/d and was titrated as required to 2 or 4 mg at 4 and 9 weeks after initiation of treatment, respectively, in those not achieving BP targets. At 14 weeks after treatment initiation, subjects not achieving BP targets could receive a combination of trandolapril 4 mg plus a calcium channel blocker (verapamil 240 mg) with or without a diuretic.

Proniosomes are dry powders, which makes richer processing and packing possible. A surfactant coated carrier method was utilized to formulate proniosomal powder containing captopril as a model drug. This system was evaluated in vitro for drug loading, vesicle size, angle of repose, encapsulation efficiency, and stability studies. This method of proniosome loading resulted in 54.16-70.10% of encapsulation. This study examined critical parameters such as type and composition of surfactant. Proniosomes were investigated by transmission electron microscopy for characterization. Four week stability data for proniosomal powder is reported, and at all sampling points significantly higher drug retention was observed. Thus, it can be concluded that the encapsulation of captopril in proniosomes facilitates the controlled release and constitutes a good choice.",

    "101": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II [ACE]) inhibitors are capable of potentiating bradykinin (BK) effects by enhancing the actions of bradykinin on B(2) receptors independent of blocking its inactivation. To investigate further the importance of ACE kininase activity on BK-induced vasodilation, we investigated the effect of inhibiting ACE, as well as other kininases, on both BK metabolism and vasodilator effect in preparations that exhibit increased ACE activity. Mesenteric arterial beds obtained from 1-kidney, 1-clip hypertensive rats presented augmented ACE and angiotensin I converting activities compared with normotensive rats. The isolated and perfused mesenteric beds were exposed to BK for 15 minutes in the absence or in the presence of kininase inhibitors; then, the perfusate was collected for analysis of the products of BK metabolism by high-performance liquid chromatography. BK was metabolized to the fragments BK(1-8), BK(1-7), and BK(1-5), and the recovery of intact BK was reduced by 47% in the hypertensive group. Recovery of BK was increased in both groups in the presence of a kininase I inhibitor and in the hypertensive group by neutral endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor; however, ACE inhibition did not affect BK metabolism in both groups. In contrast, only the ACE inhibitor potentiated the vasodilator effect of BK in a mesenteric bed preconstricted with phenylephrine; the increase in BK effect, nevertheless, was not greater in arteries from hypertensive rats that presented an increased ACE activity when compared with those in the normotensive group. These data demonstrated that ACE inhibitor-induced potentiation of BK vasodilator effects is not related to their actions on BK degradation.", 
    "102": "The Second Australian National Blood Pressure Trial reported better prognosis for hypertensive subjects randomly assigned to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) compared with a diuretic-based regimen despite no difference in brachial blood pressure control. A possible explanation is that there was a difference in central aortic pressures despite similar brachial pressure reductions. We examined this hypothesis in a subset of the Second Australian National Blood Pressure Trial cohort evaluated both before and after 4 years of treatment. The average age of the 479 subjects was 71.6+/-4.7 years (mean+/-SD), and 56% were women. Brachial systolic and pulse pressures after treatment were 145+/-1 (mean+/-SEM), 143+/-1, 72+/-1, and 70+/-1 mm Hg for diuretic and ACE-I groups, respectively. The respective changes from pretreatment values were -17+/-2, -16+/-2, -9+/-1, and -7+/-1 mm Hg. None of the differences between diuretic and ACE-I groups were significant. Central arterial pressure waveforms were acquired from carotid tonometry and calibrated from brachial pressures. Central systolic and pulse pressures posttreatment were 144+/-2, 144+/-2, 71+/-2, and 72+/-2 mm Hg for diuretic and ACE-I groups, respectively. The respective changes from pretreatment values were -15+/-2, -17+/-2, -6+/-2, and -8+/-2 mm Hg. None of the differences between diuretic and ACE-I groups were significant. The similarity of central and brachial pressures in this cohort of older hypertensive subjects is most likely because of the influences of age and hypertension in increasing arterial stiffness. There is no evidence that the better prognosis for patients randomly assigned to ACE-I in Second Australian National Blood Pressure Trial resulted from a disproportionate lowering of central blood pressure.",

Although the evidence for causal relationships has generally been conflicting, both beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) have been related to depression.

Unlike renin, inhibition of ACE activity was not directly proportional to the aliphatic chain length of SHAs. Ability of SHAs to inhibit enzyme activities and quench protein fluorescence was greater with renin than with ACE. The presence of an ACE substrate (angiotensin I) did not reduce quenching ability of SHAs, suggesting that enzyme-inhibitor interactions did not involve the active site or the substrate was displaced by inhibitor molecules. The results showed that renin is a more sensitive target than ACE for the potential antihypertensive ability of SHAs.", 
    "108": "The kinetics of Z-(cis)/E-(trans) isomerization of enalapril was investigated by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a monolith ODS column under a series of different temperature and pH conditions. At a neutral pH 7, the rate (k(obs)) of Z-(cis)/E-(trans) isomerization of enalapril at 4 degrees C (9.4 x 10(-3)min(-1)) is much lower than at 23 degrees C (1.8 x 10(-1)min(-1)), while the fractional concentration of Z-(cis) isomer is always higher than that of E-(trans) isomer in the pH range 2-7. The fractional concentration of the E-(trans) isomer becomes a maximum (about 40%) in the pH range 3-6, where enalapril exists as a zwitterion. The hydrophobicity (logP(O/W)) of both isomers was estimated by high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC). Normal phase HSCCC separation using a tert-butyl methyl ether-acetonitrile-20mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5) two-phase solvent system (2:2:3, v/v/v) at 4 degrees C was effective in partially separating the isomers, and the partition coefficient (K) of each isomer was directly calculated from the retention volume (V(R)). The logP(O/W) values of Z-(cis) and E-(trans) isomers were -0.46 and -0.65, respectively.", 
    "109": "This study investigates whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can block high glucose-induced increase of angiotensin II (Ang II) levels in cultured rat mesangial cells. Incubation of cells with high glucose for 5 days increased Ang II in the cell media (extracellular) and cell lysates (intracellular) by approximately 1.5-fold and approximately 2.2-fold, respectively. Captopril blocked high glucose-induced increase in extracellular Ang II levels but not in intracellular Ang II levels. Since the inability of captopril to inhibit intracellular Ang II in intact cells could be explained by failure of the drug to enter the cells, further studies were performed using lysates from cells pre-treated with high glucose for 5 days. Addition of captopril to cell lysates was indeed able to inhibit Ang I conversion to Ang II but only partially. These findings suggest the involvement of non-ACE mechanisms in Ang II formation from Ang I in mesangial cells.", 
    "110": "In this study, the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of two peptides isolated from beta-lactoglobulin hydrolysates with thermolysin was evaluated. These peptides, with sequences LLF [beta-lg f(103-105)] and LQKW [beta-lg f(58-61)], showed potent in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity. Two hours after administration, both sequences caused a clear and significant decrease in the blood pressure of these rats. The impact of a simulated gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory and antihypertensive activities of these peptides was also studied. The results showed that both fragments were susceptible to proteolytic degradation after incubation with pepsin and Corolase PP. In addition, their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity decreased after the simulated digestion. It is likely that fragment LQK was the active end product of the gastrointestinal digestion of peptide LQKW. The fragment LL, observed after digestion of peptide LLF, probably exert its antihypertensive effect through a mechanism of action different than ACE-inhibition.",

In particular, the human homologue of ACE (ACE2) has added a higher level of complexity to the RAAS. In a short period of time, ACE2 has been cloned, purified, knocked-out, knocked-in; inhibitors have been developed; its 3D structure determined; and new functions have been identified.

Present prevention strategies, mainly confined to high-risk subjects (proposed implantable cardioverter defibrillators recipients), have a limited effect on SCD burden in the general population. A relatively unexplored strategy for extending SCD prevention could imply targeting the early (upstream) processes of the complex cascade leading to SCD by non-antiarrhythmic drugs (i.e., beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor-blocker agents, statins and omega-3 fatty acids).

The diagnosis was suspected after excluding the lung origin of the mass (observed by plain chest radiography) by thorax computed tomography but it was confirmed only by cardiac-gated magnetic resonance imaging and transthoracic biopsy. Considering both patient's age and comorbidity, and local extension of the lesion, after counseling with cardiac surgeons and oncologists, the patient was treated only by conservative medical therapy. The patient died 6 months after the diagnosis due to a superior vena cava syndrome as an effect of infiltration and obstruction of superior vena cava by the tumor at the site of vein entry in the right atrium.

However, significant improvement of systolic thickening in hybernated segments by SPECT as well as a significant rise of LV EF were recorded only in the treatment with trimethasidine MB. Stress echocardiography with dobutamine had high specificity (85.7%) but low sensitivity (50.4%) in detection of hybernated myocardium.",

    "131": "Ramipril has been used in twice daily dose of 5 mg in most heart failure trials, whereas the dose used in Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study was 10 mg once at bedtime. The HOPE investigators in an ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) substudy observed a fall of nighttime but not daytime blood pressure (BP). We examined the effects of once daily ramipril 10 mg versus 5 mg twice a day. Twenty-nine patients were recruited based on the original criteria for the HOPE study and were given ramipril either in twice-daily dose (5 mg b.d.) or once daily (10 mg o.d.) each morning in randomized, prospective crossover trial. Twenty-four hour ABP recordings were taken just before commencement of ramipril therapy and after treatment with twice-daily and once-daily ramipril. Our results show that ramipril causes a significant reduction of BP over 24-h period as compared with baseline. The mean baseline ABP was 124/73 mm Hg, which reduced to 117/69 mm Hg for the twice-a-day regimen (P<0.001) and 115/68 mm Hg for the once a day regimen (P<0.001). Both regimes effectively lower BP to a similar extent. Ramipril causes significant BP reduction in both once- and twice-daily dosing. The fall in BP after daytime dosing is greater than that observed in the HOPE study (including ABP substudy). Once-daily dosing in the morning seems to be effective in causing a significant reduction in the ABP profile of patients at high-risk of a future vascular event.", 
    "132": "The acute effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers may be important in some clinical settings. To assess the acute impact of such drugs on arterial function, we studied the effects of captopril 25 mg, quinapril 20 mg and telmisartan 80 mg on 100 hypertensive patients, according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Central (aortic) blood pressure (BP) and augmentation index (AIx, a measure of wave reflections), as well as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and forearm blood flow (FBF) (measures of conduit and resistance artery endothelial function, respectively), were evaluated before and 2 h after oral drug administration. Compared to placebo, captopril and quinapril decreased central systolic (by 7.5 mm Hg, P<0.05 and by 12.3 mm Hg, P<0.001) and diastolic BP (by 4.9 mm Hg, P<0.01 and by 8.4 mm Hg, P<0.001), whereas telmisartan had no significant effect (P=NS). Additionally, AIx was reduced after quinapril (absolute decrease of 7.2%, P<0.01) and marginally after captopril (decrease of 4.7%, P=0.07). Only quinapril led to a beneficial change of FMD (absolute increase of 2.7%, P<0.001). No treatment was related to significant changes of peak hyperaemic or 3-min hyperaemic FBF. In adjusted analyses, all the favourable alterations induced by quinapril were independent of potential confounding haemodynamic factors. Our data show that acute RAS inhibition with quinapril (20 mg) may be more beneficial in terms of arterial function and central haemodynamics compared to captopril (25 mg) or telmisartan (80 mg). Further studies are needed to investigate whether these acute arterial effects of quinapril are clinically significant.", 
    "133": "Numerous population studies confirm the high prevalence of hypertension in type II diabetic (DM2) subjects and that intensive antihypertensive treatment is more beneficial to diabetic than to nondiabetic hypertensive subjects, yet not many of these are specific to Spain. To assess the degree of blood pressure (BP) control and the effects of antihypertensive drugs in the medical management of hypertension in diabetic patients in specialist care centres throughout Spain, we studied the socio-demographic, clinical and relevant laboratory parameters of 796 hypertensive patients with DM2 (mean age 66.09 (95% confidence interval (CI): 64.08-68.10). The percentage of diabetic patients responding positively to BP control measures was lower when compared to the nondiabetic population in both Spain and Europe. The degree of control was poorer for systolic than for diastolic BP, yet 40.6% of the patients were only on monotherapy. The fact that antihypertensive treatment was modified in only 40% of the poorly controlled patients was also highly significant and could be attributed to a nonstringent use of clinical guidelines. Among the other differences between well-controlled and poorly controlled patients, we found that well-controlled patients presented with lower levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, a lower prevalence of excess weight/obesity, and a greater prevalence of cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular disease despite having a greater percentage of patients on antiplatelet therapy. Better application of therapeutic guidelines and the prevention and treatment of compounding factors could improve the response rate to BP control measures in poorly controlled patients.",

Strain rate (SR) imaging is a novel echocardiographic technique to quantify left atrial (LA) function. However, it has not been determined whether SR imaging is applicable for detection of LA dysfunction in hypertensive (HT) patients. We used SR imaging to assess alteration in LA function in HT patients and its modification by RAS inhibitors. SR imaging was performed in 80 HT patients and 50 age-matched normotensive (NT) subjects. HT patients were divided into two groups according to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and LA dilatation. Peak SR was measured at each LA segment (septal, lateral, posterior, anterior, and inferior) and mean peak systolic SR (SR-LAs) was calculated by averaging data in each segment. Mean SR-LAs levels in the dilated LA group (1.97+/-0.45 s(-1), n=25) and non-dilated LA group (2.15+/-0.57 s(-1), n=55) were significantly (p<0.05) lower than that in NT subjects (2.53+/-0.71 s(-1)). Irrespective of the presence or absence of LVH, mean SR-LAs in HT patients was lower than that in NT subjects. When RAS inhibitors were used, the mean SR-LAs level in the non-dilated LA group was equivalent to that in NT subjects. In HT patients, mean SR-LAs, an index of LA reservoir function, decreases before development of LA enlargement and LVH. Treatment with RAS inhibitors appears to preserve LA reservoir function in HT patients without dilated LA. SR imaging can detect LA dysfunction in HT patients and is useful for evaluation of the therapeutic benefit on LA reservoir function.",

Hemodynamic studies were performed in 300 participants from 5 PEACE centers a median of 52 months (range, 25 to 80 months) after random assignment to trandolapril at a target dose of 4 mg per day or placebo. Central pulsatile hemodynamics and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity were assessed by using echocardiography, tonometry of the carotid and femoral arteries, and body surface transit distances. Patients randomly assigned to trandolapril tended to be older (mean+/-SD: 64.2+/-7.9 versus 62.9+/-7.7 years; P=0.14), with a higher body mass index (28.5+/-4.0 versus 27.8+/-3.9 kg/m(2); P=0.09) and lower ejection fraction (57.1+/-8.1% versus 58.7+/-8.4%; P<0.01). At the time of the hemodynamic substudy, the trandolapril group had lower mean arterial pressure (93.1+/-10.2 versus 96.3+/-11.3 mm Hg; P<0.01) and lower carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (geometric mean [95% CI]: 10.4 m/s [10.0 to 10.9 m/s] versus 11.2 m/s [10.7 to 11.8 m/s]; P=0.02).

The current study identifies the active components in GFJ responsible for its esterase-inhibitory effect. The esterase-inhibitory potential of 10 constitutive flavonoids and furanocoumarins toward p-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA) hydrolysis was investigated. The furanocoumarins bergamottin, 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, and bergapten, and the glycoside flavonoids naringin and hesperidin, at concentrations found in GFJ or higher, did not inhibit the hydrolysis of PNPA by purified porcine esterase and human liver microsomes. However, the flavonoid aglycones morin, galangin, kaempferol, quercetin, and naringenin showed appreciable inhibition of PNPA hydrolysis in purified porcine esterase, and human and rat liver systems. In Caco-2 cells, demonstrated to contain minimal CYP3A activity, the permeability coefficient of the prodrugs lovastatin and enalapril was increased in the presence of the active flavonoids kaempferol and naringenin, consistent with inhibition of esterase activity. In rats, oral coadministration of kaempferol and naringenin with these prodrugs led to significant increases in plasma exposure to the active acids. In addition, in portal vein-cannulated rats, coadministration of lovastatin with kaempferol (10 mg/kg) led to a 154% and a 113% increase in the portal plasma exposure to the prodrug and active acid, respectively, compared with coadministration with water. The contribution of CYP3A inhibition was demonstrated to be minimal. Overall, a series of flavonoids present in GFJ are identified as esterase inhibitors, of which kaempferol and naringenin are shown to mediate pharmacokinetic drug interaction with the prodrugs lovastatin and enalapril due to their capability of esterase inhibition.",

Nitroglycerin relieves pulmonary congestion primarily through direct venodilation, but may dilate coronary arteries and increase collateral blood flow at higher doses, an effect desirable in patients with ischemia. Tachyphylaxis may develop, necessitating incremental dosing. The major adverse effects of nitrates are hypotension and headache. Nitroprusside is a balanced arterial and venous vasodilator with a very short half-life, facilitating rapid titration. Afterload reduction lowers blood pressure and can increase stroke volume. The major complications of nitroprusside therapy are hypotension, and toxicity from accumulation of cyanide or thiocyanate, usually in patients with renal insufficiency treated for more than 24 h. Nesiritide, a recombinant form of human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), is a venous and arterial vasodilator that may also potentiate the effect of concomitant diuretics. Hypotension is the most common side effect. In addition, meta-analyses have suggested that nesiritide may worsen renal function and decrease survival at 30 days compared to conventional therapies. Resolution of these concerns awaits completion of appropriately powered prospective clinical trials. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have vasodilatory effects, but intravenous infusion of enalapril within 24 h of ischemic chest pain is not recommended. Oral ACE inhibition may be used to reduce afterload in other settings if blood pressure permits. Use of calcium antagonists in acute heart failure is not recommended.",

    "188": "Attraction of mononuclear cells to sites of inflammation requires a close interplay of the inflammatory signal presented via chemokines and specific receptors on effector cells. First studies on acute renal transplant rejection demonstrated the involvement of CC-chemokines, such as RANTES, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and MCP-1, as well as CXC-chemokines such as IL-8 and IP-10, correlating with expression of the corresponding chemokine receptors, CCR1, CCR5 and CCR2 as well as CXCR3. Since then, the pathophysiologic relevance has been extended to chronic allograft nephropathy and transplant glomerulopathy. Chemokine expression can be triggered by different stimuli, e.g. brain death, ischemia, HLA-mismatch and infection. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory chemokines have been identified. Chemokine receptor 7, e.g. enhances homing of lymphocytes to lymphatic tissues and the Duffy antigen receptor, DARC, a non-specific receptor that binds and inactivates different chemokines. While measurement of chemokine expression in clinical transplantation may facilitate the differential diagnosis of allograft dysfunction, knowledge of the chemokine network has also widened the understanding of transplant rejection and opened novel therapeutic approaches. Observations from humans with mutations of the chemokine network as well as transplantation of animals with targeted deletions in this system suggest that manipulations of chemokine signalling may improve the success rates of transplantation. Blocking chemokines unselectively with Met-RANTES or specifically with small molecule inhibitors of various chemokine receptors has lead to improved outcome in animal models. Currently, first human trials are under way to investigate drugs that stimulate lymphocyte homing. Inhibitors of CCR1 and CCR5 are being tested for other human diseases and may eventually be available in transplantation. Nonetheless, chemokine blockade my rather serve as an adjunct in the management of transplant recipients than a new \"magic bullet\".", 
    "189": "The renin-angiotensin system is activated in the developing kidney and is necessary for normal renal development, but is further activated by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). During nephrogenesis, there is a switch from a preponderance of angiotensin AT(2) to AT(1) receptors in the rat. We examined the renal cellular response to angiotensin II receptor inhibition in the neonatal rat subjected to partial UUO under anesthesia within 48 h of birth. Group I (\"early\") received saline vehicle, losartan (AT(1) inhibitor), or PD-123319 (AT(2) inhibitor) during the completion of nephrogenesis in the first 10 days of life. Group II (\"late\") received each of the three treatments throughout the subsequent 10 days of life. Kidneys were harvested at 21 days, and the distribution of renin, apoptosis, macrophages, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and collagen was determined. Losartan and PD-123319 each increased vascular renin distribution in both kidneys. Partial UUO reduced growth and increased apoptosis, macrophages, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and collagen in the obstructed kidney. Early losartan treatment further increased alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen in the obstructed kidney and induced apoptosis, macrophages, and collagen in the contralateral kidney. Late losartan treatment had no effect on any of the parameters in either kidney, and PD-123319 had no effect on either kidney. We conclude that selective inhibition of AT(1) receptors during nephrogenesis (but not during subsequent renal maturation) exacerbates injury to the obstructed kidney and also injures the contralateral kidney. These results suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers should be avoided in the developing hydronephrotic kidney.",

    "193": "In diabetic and nondiabetic chronic nephropathies, high blood pressure and urinary loss of proteins represent major determinants of progressive renal function decline. Reducing blood pressure with drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system also lowers glomerular hypertension and ameliorates glomerular sieving properties, thus reducing proteinuria. Reducing urinary protein levels with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA) limits renal function decline to the point that remission of disease and regression of renal lesions have been observed in experimental animals and in humans. This therapy, however, may not be effective in all patients. For patients who do not achieve complete remission of proteinuria, renoprotective treatment should include intensified blood pressure control (and metabolic control in diabetes) and amelioration of dyslipidemia. Early intervention, before progressive glomerulosclerosis and scarring is initiated by increased protein traffic, may be important to maximize reno- and cardioprotection, especially in diabetes.",

The rats treated with hEW were classed in a different group than the control rats and the rats treated with EW by cluster analysis, taking into account their tissue ACE activities and their systolic blood pressure (SBP). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that SBP in SHR was negatively related with ACE activity in plasma and positively related with ACE activity in aorta and kidney. ACE activity in plasma significantly increased after the long-term treatment with hEW (0.5 g/kg/day). ACE activity in aorta and kidney was significantly inhibited 4 h after the short-term administration of hEW.

Currently available drugs bind both active sites of its two homologous domains, although it is now understood that these domains function differently in vivo. The recently solved crystal structures of both domains (N and C) open the door to new domain-specific inhibitor design, taking advantage of the differences between these two large active sites. Here we present the first crystal structure at a resolution of 2.25 A of testis ACE (identical to the C domain of somatic ACE) with the highly C-domain-specific phosphinic inhibitor, RXPA380. Testis ACE retains the same conformation as seen in previously determined inhibitor complexes, but the RXPA380 central backbone conformation is more similar to that seen for the inhibitor captopril than enalaprilat. The RXPA380 molecule occupies more subsites of the testis ACE active site than the previously determined inhibitors and possesses bulky moieties that extend into the S2' and S2 subsites. Thus the high affinity of RXPA380 for the testis ACE/somatic ACE C domain is explained by the interaction of these bulky moieties with residues unique to these domains, specifically Phe 391, Val 379, and Val 380, that are not found in the N domain. The characterization of the extended active site and the binding of a potent C-domain-selective inhibitor provide the first structural data for the design of truly domain-specific pharmacophores.", 
    "202": "The cerebrovascular remodeling is a prominent feature of hypertension and considered a major risk factor for stroke. Cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells meet volume challenge during this pathophysiological process. Our previous studies suggest that volume regulated chloride channels may be critical to the cell cycle of vascular smooth muscle cells. However, it is unknown whether the volume-regulated chloride movement is altered in hypertension. Therefore, we directly measured the concentration of intracellular chloride ([Cl(-)](i)) in rat basilar arterial smooth muscle cells isolated from control rats and rats that were made hypertensive for 1 to 12 weeks after partial renal artery constriction (2-kidney, 2-clip method) using a 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium iodide fluorescence probe. The [Cl(-)](i) in isotonic solution showed no difference in all of the groups. After hypotonic perfusion, the reduction in [Cl(-)](i) was more prominent in hypertensive cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells than in sham control cells. Genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibited hypotonic-induced reduction in [Cl(-)](i), whereas sodium orthovanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, enhanced hypotonic-induced reduction in [Cl(-)](i) in both groups. The percentage inhibition of reduction in [Cl(-)](i) by genistein on volume-regulated chloride movement has a positive correlation with blood pressure levels in the 2-kidney, 2-clip hypertensive group, as is the case for the percentage increase of reduction in [Cl(-)](i) by sodium orthovanadate. Antihypertensive therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril completely reversed abnormal volume-regulated chloride movement in hypertensive rats. We conclude that volume-regulated chloride movement is augmented in rat cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells in proportion to the severity of hypertension.", 
    "203": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, and declining kidney function are recognized as risk factors for adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure. This analysis was conducted to evaluate whether anemia is a risk factor for kidney function decrease in patients with heart failure. Data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a randomized trial of enalapril versus placebo in patients with ejection fractions <or=35%, were analyzed. After randomization, creatinine measurements were taken at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 4 months, and every 4 months thereafter. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) equation, and GFR slope was calculated. \"Rapid decrease\" was defined as a decrease in the GFR of >or=6 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year. Anemia was defined as baseline hematocrit <36%. Multivariate logistic regression weighted by the number of GFR assessments was used to test the relation between anemia and rapid decrease. We also evaluated whether CKD (baseline GFR </=60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) modified the relation between anemia and rapid decrease. In the 6,360 subjects, the mean age was 59 years, 31% had CKD, and 6% had anemia. Median follow-up was 2 years. In multivariate analysis, anemia was associated with a 1.30 increased odds (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.45) of rapid decrease in GFR. In subjects with CKD, anemia was associated with a 1.71 increased odds (95% confidence interval 1.43 to 2.05) of rapid decrease, while in subjects without CKD, anemia was associated with a 1.16 increased odds (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.31) of rapid decrease (p for interaction <0.001). In conclusion, anemia is associated with a rapid decrease in kidney function in patients with heart failure, particularly in those with underlying CKD.",

Of these patients, 75% will die of some form of heart or vascular disease. Furthermore, recent data suggest that even prediabetic patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Patients with diabetes often have multiple comorbid CV risk factors (e.g., dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia) that synergistically interact to accelerate the pathogenesis of CV disease and dramatically increase the risk for CV events. For example, compared with patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes have a 3- to 5-fold increased risk of death due to congestive heart disease at every cholesterol level and are at increased risk for hypertension and hypertension-related CV events. Patients with diabetes are likely to benefit from intensive therapy incorporating multiple CV risk-reduction strategies. Lipid-modification--primarily reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) through pharmacologic and lifestyle intervention--is an integral part of such therapy. Patients with diabetes will also benefit from intensive blood pressure-lowering therapy with multiple classes of antihypertensives including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in particular, as well as concomitant antiplatelet therapy. An intensive risk-reduction approach combining these treatments would dramatically reduce the incidence of CV morbidity and mortality in this high-risk patient population.", 
    "209": "An abundance of clinical data exists to support the ability of pharmacologic interventions to reduce risk for vascular events significantly; however, there remains a gap between this evidence and current clinical practice. Recent data from large-scale, placebo-controlled statin trials demonstrate that these agents dramatically reduce risk for cardiovascular events, even in moderate-risk patients with normal to moderately elevated cholesterol levels. Data from trials of a broad range of antihypertensives reinforce the value of blood pressure (BP) management and indicate that some of these agents may have additional benefits beyond BP reduction. Similarly, meta-analyses of randomized trials confirm that antiplatelet therapy prevents serious cardiovascular events in a wide range of high-risk patients. Each of these interventions alone has been demonstrated to reduce the risk for vascular events by approximately 25 to 30%. A combination approach utilizing intensive risk-reducing therapy with more than one of these agents has the potential to reduce the risk for vascular events by as much as 75%. Combined with nonpharmacologic risk reduction strategies, including exercise, diet, and smoking cessation, an opportunity exists to reduce the incidence of both first and recurrent cardiovascular events dramatically.", 
    "210": "Chronic treatment of rats with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, results in hypertension mediated partly by enhanced angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. We examined the influence of L-NAME on rat liver morphology, on hepatic glycogen, cholesterol, and triglyceride content, and on the activities of the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A1/2, CYP2B1/2, CYP2C11, and CYP2E1. Male Wistar rats were treated with L-NAME (20 mg/rat per day via drinking water) for 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and their livers were then removed for analysis. Enzymatic induction was produced by treating rats with phenobarbital (to induce CYP2B1/2), beta-naphthoflavone (to induce CYP1A1/2), or pyrazole (to induce CYP2E1). L-NAME significantly elevated blood pressure; this was reversed by concomitant treatment with enalapril (ACE inhibitor) or losartan (angiotensin II AT(1) receptor antagonist). L-NAME caused vascular hypertrophy in hepatic arteries, with perivascular and interstitial fibrosis involving collagen deposition. Hepatic glycogen content also significantly increased. L-NAME did not affect fasting glucose levels but significantly reduced insulin levels and increased the insulin sensitivity of rats, based on an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Immunoblotting experiments indicated enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase B and of glycogen synthase kinase 3. All these changes were reversed by concomitant treatment with enalapril or losartan. L-NAME had no effect on hepatic cholesterol or triglyceride content or on the basal or drug-induced activities and protein expression of the cytochrome P450 isoforms. Thus, the chronic inhibition of NO biosynthesis produced hepatic morphological alterations and changes in glycogen metabolism mediated by the renin-angiotensin system. The increase in hepatic glycogen content probably resulted from enhanced glycogen synthase activity following the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 by phosphorylation.",

The antidepressants with the least potential for altering antiepileptic drug (AED) metabolism are citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, duloxetine, and mirtazapine. The use of established AEDs with enzyme-inducing properties, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, may be associated with reductions in the levels of drugs such as donepezil, galantamine, and particularly warfarin. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital have been reported to decrease prothrombin time in patients taking oral anticoagulants, although with phenytoin, an increase in prothrombin time has also been reported. Drugs associated with increased risk of bleeding in patients taking oral anticoagulants include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (especially fluoxetine), gemfibrozil, fluvastatin, and lovastatin. Other drugs affected by enzyme inducers include cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates, such as calcium channel blockers (e.g., nimodipine, nilvadipine, nisoldipine, and felodipine) and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. Although there have been no reports of AEDs altering ticlopidine metabolism, ticlopidine coadministration can result in carbamazepine and phenytoin toxicity. Also, there is a significant risk of elevated levels of carbamazepine when diltiazem and verapamil are administered. In addition, there are case reports of phenytoin toxicity when administered with diltiazem. Drugs with a lower potential for metabolic drug interactions include (1) cholinesterase inhibitors (although the theoretical possibility of a reduction in donepezil and galantamine levels by enzyme-inducing AEDs should be considered) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine and (2) antihypertensives such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, hydrophilic beta-blockers, and thiazide diuretics. There is a moderate risk that enzyme-inducing AEDs will decrease levels of lipophilic beta-blockers. Newer AEDs have a lower potential for drug interactions. In particular, levetiracetam and gabapentin have not been reported to alter enzyme activity. In summary, there is a significant potential for drug interactions between AEDs and drugs commonly prescribed in geriatric patients with epilepsy.",

A reduction of left ventricular end-systolic diameter (4.94+/-0.85 vs 4.30+/-1.17 cm, P<0.05) was observed in the add-on group. At the end of 1 year, more patients have normal or abnormal relaxation pattern in the add-on group than the control group (82% vs 53% chi(2)=7.1, P=0.02).

    "234": "To evaluate the effect of the standardized aqueous extract (AE) of Cecropia glaziovii Sneth on the plasma angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE-EC 3.4.15.1) activity, rats were treated with a single dose of AE (1 g/kg, p.o.) or repeatedly (0.5 g/kg/bid, p.o.) for 60 days. Captopril (50 mg/kg, p.o.) was used as positive control on the same animals. The effects on the blood pressure were recorded directly from the femoral artery (single dose), or indirectly by the tail cuff method (repeated doses) in conscious rats. The plasma ACE activity was determined spectrofluorimetrically using Hypuril-Hystidine-Leucine as substrate. The arterial blood pressure, heart rate and plasma ACE activity were not significantly modified within 24 h after a single dose administration of AE. Comparatively, blood pressure in captopril treated rats was reduced by 7-16% and heart rate was increased by 10-20% from 30 min to 24 h after drug administration. ACE activity after captopril presented a dual response: an immediate inhibition peaking at 30 min and a slow reversal to 32% up-regulation after 24 h. To correlate the drug effects upon repeated administration of either compound, normotensive rats were separated in three groups: animals with high ACE (48.8+/-2.6 nmol/min/ml), intermediate ACE (39.4+/-1.4 nmol/min/ml) and low ACE (23.5+/-0.6 nmol/min/ml) activity, significantly different among them. Repeated treatment with AE reduced the mean systolic blood pressure (121.7+/-0.5 mm Hg) by 20 mm Hg after 14 days. The hypotension was reversed upon washout 60 days afterwards. Likely, repeated captopril administration decreased blood pressure by 20 mm Hg throughout treatment in all groups. After 30 days treatment with AE (0.5 g/kg/bid, p.o.) the plasma ACE activity was unchanged in any experimental group. After captopril (50 mg/kg/bid, p.o.) administration the plasma ACE activity was inhibited by 50% within 1 h treatment but it was up-regulated by 120% after 12 h in all groups. It is concluded that the hypotension produced by prolonged treatment with AE of C. glaziovii is unrelated to ACE inhibition.", 
    "235": "In myocardial ischaemia and heart failure, beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) e.g. pindolol, xamoterol, bucindolol, nebivolol, have performed poorly in reducing morbidity and mortality. In both indications beta-1 blockade is the vital active ingredient. Beta-1 blockade (bisoprolol) is now an alternative first-line choice to Ace-inhibition in the treatment of heart failure. The therapeutic role of beta-blockers in hypertension is less well understood, particularly since the new recommendations in the UK from the NICE committee stating that: 1. beta-blockers are no longer preferred as a routine initial therapy, 2. the combination with diuretics is discouraged due to the risk of induced diabetes, and 3. in younger patients first-choice initial therapy should be an ACE-inhibitor. Recent data from the Framingham Heart Study and other epidemiological studies have indicated that the development of diastolic hypertension in younger subjects is closely linked to weight-increase and an increase in peripheral resistance; such subjects have a high adrenergic drive and cardiac output. In contrast, elderly systolic hypertension mostly arises de novo via poor vascular compliance. Thus in younger, probably overweight, hypertensives (including diabetics) first-line beta-blockade has performed well in preventing myocardial infarction (a fact hidden by meta-analyses that do not take age into account). Conversely, in elderly hypertensives first-line beta-blockade (atenolol) has performed poorly in reducing cardiovascular risk (due to partial beta-2 blockade atenolol evokes metabolic disturbance and does not improve vascular compliance, or effectively lower central aortic pressure or reverse left ventricular hypertrophy). Thus beta-blockers like atenolol are ill-equipped for first-line therapy in elderly hypertension. Some beta-blockers, e.g. bisoprolol (up to 10 mg/day is highly beta-1 selective) and nebivolol (beta-2/3 intrinsic sympathomimetic activity), do improve vascular compliance and cause no metabolic disturbance. Beta-blockers as second-line to low-dose diuretics (which, by improving vascular compliance and increasing sympathetic nerve activity, create an optimal environment for beta-blockade) in elderly hypertension (including diabetics) have performed well in reducing cardiovascular events (this combination has the added bonus of reducing the risk of bone fracture by about 30%). Meta-analyses which include studies where it is unclear whether a diuretic or beta-blocker was a first-line therapy will dilute the benefit stemming from first-line diuretic/second-line beta-blockade. Hypertensives (of all ages) with ischaemia are well suited to beta-blockade.",

The purification and identification of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide extracted from Bellamya purificata hydrolysate are described. The peptide was purified twice with semi-preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to obtain an active fraction with an inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) of 43.5 micromol/L. The primary structure of the purified peptide was identified by the high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS) and the martix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) combining with the amino acid composition analysis. Finally, it was identified as a tetrapeptide and sequenced as Lys-Glu-Ile-Trp (KEIW), which has the common characters of ACE inhibitory peptide extracted from selfish muscle. The structure identification results from the two methods were also compared in this study. The results from ESI-MS included a lot of information, such as the total ion current chromatogram and ultraviolet scan spectrum. However, the exact structure could only be from the MALDI-TOF MS analysis, in which the exact MS/MS spectrum could be obtained. Furthermore, the m/z measurement precision of MALDI-TOF MS was 0.0001 and much better than that of 0.1 of ESI-MS.", 
    "241": "The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)'s guidelines for lupus state that mycophenolate mofetil has at least equivalent efficacy to and less toxicity than cyclophosphamide for the short-and medium-term treatment of lupus nephritis but that long-term data are available only for cyclophosphamide. New therapies are needed to reduce toxicity and the need for steroids and to offer the possibility of cure. Therapies under investigation include other immunosuppressive agents, anti-cellular therapies, drugs that modify cell-cell interactions, (anti-)cytokine therapy, hormone therapy and lupus-specific immunomodulation. Rituximab has shown promise in patients refractory to conventional immunosuppression, which suggests that targeting B cells may be successful. Other anti-cell therapies include epratuzumab, belimumab and alemtuzumab. Anti-cytokine approaches include tumour necrosis factor alpha blockade with infliximab, anti-interleukin 6-receptor therapy with tocilizumab and interferon-alpha blockade. As antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies correlate with flares of lupus nephritis, they may represent another therapeutic target--as do monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and protein kinase CK2. Therapeutic options to prevent damage in lupus nephritis include non-immunosuppressive treatments aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk (such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aspirin). As was the case with rheumatoid arthritis, a change in therapeutic aims--from survival through prevention of renal failure to induction of remission--may modify outcomes. EULAR's guidelines state that renal biopsy is the best monitor of clinical outcome in lupus nephritis, as immunological tests have limited predictive value. Measurement of urinary mRNA for cytokine and growth factor genes may provide a more sensitive, non-invasive method of monitoring therapeutic response.", 
    "242": "Congestive heart failure is a pathologic condition characterized by progressive decrease in left ventricular contractility and consequent decline of cardiac output. There is convincing clinical and experimental evidence that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its primary effector peptide, angiotensin II, are linked to the pathophysiology of interstitial fibrosis, cardiac remodeling, and heart failure. In addition to the traditional endocrine or circulating RAS, an active tissue RAS has been characterized. Tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme and locally synthesized angiotensin II, for example, by chymase, exert local trophic effects that modulate gene expression, which regulates growth and proliferation in both myocytes and nonmyocytes. The existence of the tissue RAS offers an opportunity for targeted imaging, which may be of considerable value for guiding medical therapy.",

    "247": "Food proteins contain latent biofunctional peptide sequences within their primary structures which may have the ability to exert a physiological response in vivo. A large range of biofunctional peptides have been isolated from food proteins including opioid, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, mineral binding, growth and muscle stimulating, anti-cancer, proteinase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) inhibitory peptides. The biofunctional peptide activity currently most studied in food proteins appears to be those that inhibit ACE. ACE plays a central role in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) through the production of the potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin (Ang) II , and the degradation of the vasodilator, bradykinin (BK). ACE inhibitory peptides may therefore have the ability to lower BP in vivo by limiting the vasoconstrictory effects of Ang II and by potentiating the vasodilatory effects of BK. These ACE inhibitory peptides can be enzymatically released from intact proteins in vitro and in vivo during food processing and gastrointestinal digestion, respectively. ACE inhibitory peptides may be generated in or incorporated into functional foods in the development of 'natural' beneficial health products. Several products are currently on the market or are in development that contain peptide sequences which have ACE inhibitory properties. Detailed human studies are required in order to demonstrate the efficacy of these bioactive peptides prior to their widespread utilisation as physiologically beneficial functional foods/food ingredients.", 
    "248": "Nowadays the endothelium is considered a key determinant of vascular health. NO is the principal mediator of all endothelial protective effects, due to its antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, immunomodulatory and vasorelaxant properties. On the contrary, a growing body of evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular events. Emerging data suggest that acute coronary syndromes (ACS) may involve a complex interplay between endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and thrombosis. Despite the success in reducing the mortality from acute cardiovascular events, the incidence of cardiovascular disease and its complication continues to increase. New insights into mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction, such as a better understanding of the regulation of vascular sources of oxygen radicals, may lead to novel therapeutic strategies with the potential to improve prognosis. The key pharmacological agents that improve clinical outcome in high-risk patients are statins, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Compelling scientific evidence suggests that these medications are effective in improving endothelial function. The present review focuses on the potential importance of benefits on endothelium of these medicaments in the management of acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "249": "The role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) genes on the risk of lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) in elderly people remains unclear. We assessed the relationship of genetic polymorphisms in RAS: G-6A, T174M and M235T of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE_I/D) variant to the risk of LEAD in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study. This analysis included 1228 black and 1306 white men and women whose age ranged between 70 and 79 years at the study enrollment. LEAD was defined as ankle-arm index (AAI) <0.9. Genotype-phenotype associations were estimated by regression analyses with and without adjustment for established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The proportion of LEAD was significantly higher in black (21.1%) than that in white elderly people (10.1%, P<0.0001). The distribution of AGT polymorphisms was also significantly different between black and white participants. There was no statistically significant association between the selected RAS genetic variants and LEAD after adjustment for age, antihypertensive medications, lipid-lowering medication, pack-year smoking, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and prevalent diabetes and coronary heart disease. However, A-T haplotype of G-6A and M235T interacting with homozygous ACE_II (beta=-1.07, P=0.006) and with ACE inhibitors (beta=-1.03, P=0.01) significantly decreased the risk of LEAD in white but not in black participants after adjustment for the selected CVD risk factors. In conclusion, the study observed a gene-gene and gene-drug interaction for LEAD in the white elderly.",

The estimation of the predictive value of the I/D polymorphism is based on a systematic review showing that DD carriers tend to respond well to ACE inhibitors, while II carriers seem not to benefit adequately from this treatment. Data on the ACE inhibitor effectiveness in nephropathy were derived from the REIN (Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy) trial. We calculated the number of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) prevented and the differences in the incremental costs and incremental effect expressed as life-years free of ESRD. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the robustness of the results.",

    "254": "Intraglomerular ANG II has been linked to glomerular injury. However, little is known about the contribution of podocytes (POD) to intraglomerular ANG II homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to examine the processing of angiotensin substrates by cultured POD. Our approach was to use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for peptide determination from conditioned cell media and customized AQUA peptides for quantification. Immortalized mouse POD were incubated with 1-2 microM ANG I, ANG II, or the renin substrate ANG-(1-14) for different time intervals and coincubated in parallel with various inhibitors. Human mesangial cells (MES) were used as controls. POD incubated with 1 microM ANG I primarily formed ANG-(1-9) and ANG-(1-7). In contrast, MES incubated with ANG I primarily generated ANG II. In POD, ANG-(1-7) was the predominant product, and its formation was inhibited by a neprilysin inhibitor. Modest angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was also detected in POD, although only after cells were incubated with 2 microM ANG I. In addition, we observed that POD degraded ANG II into ANG III and ANG-(1-7). An aminopeptidase A inhibitor inhibited ANG III formation, and an ACE2 inhibitor led to ANG II accumulation. Furthermore, we found that POD converted ANG-(1-14) to ANG I and ANG-(1-7). This conversion was inhibited by a renin inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that POD express a functional intrinsic renin-angiotensin system characterized by neprilysin, aminopeptidase A, ACE2, and renin activities, which predominantly lead to ANG-(1-7) and ANG-(1-9) formation, as well as ANG II degradation. These findings may reflect a specific role of POD in maintenance of intraglomerular renin-angiotensin system balance.", 
    "255": "Regulation of protein kinase activities is crucial in both physiology and disease, but analysis is hampered by the multitude and complexity of kinase networks. We used novel peptide array chips containing 1,152 known kinase substrate sequences to profile different kinase activities in renal lysates from homozygous Ren2 rats, a model characterized by hypertension and angiotensin II (ANG II)-mediated renal fibrosis, compared with Sprague-Dawley (SD) control rats and Ren2 rats treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). Five-wk-old homozygous Ren2 rats were left untreated or treated with the ACEi ramipril (1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) for 4 wk; age-matched SD rats served as controls (n = 5 each). Peptide array chips were incubated with renal cortical lysates in the presence of radioactively labeled ATP. Radioactivity incorporated into the substrate motifs was measured to quantify kinase activity. A number of kinases with modulated activities, which might contribute to renal damage, were validated by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry. Relevant kinases identified by the peptide array and confirmed using conventional techniques included p38 MAP kinase and PDGF receptor-beta, which were increased in Ren2 and reversed by ACEi. Furthermore, insulin receptor signaling was reduced in Ren2 compared with control rats, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) activity decreased in Ren2 + ACEi compared with untreated Ren2 rats. Array-based profiling of tissue kinase activities in ANG II-mediated renal damage provides a powerful tool for identification of relevant kinase pathways in vivo and may lead to novel strategies for therapy.",

Six other dogs were sham. We measured regional IZ and non-infarct zone (NIZ) collagens (hydroxyproline; types I/III; cross-linking), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and topography at 6 weeks, and hemodynamics, LV diastolic and systolic function, and remodeling over 6 weeks. Compared to sham, placebo-RSTEMI differentially altered regional collagens, with more pronounced increase in TGF-beta, hydroxyproline, and type I, insoluble, and cross-linked collagens in the IZ than NIZ, and increased IZ soluble and type III collagens at 6 weeks, and induced persistent LV filling pressure elevation, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and LV remodeling over 6 weeks. Compared to placebo-RSTEMI, candesartan and enalapril limited adverse regional collagen remodeling, with normalization of type III, soluble and insoluble collagens and decrease in pyridinoline cross-linking in the IZ at 6 weeks, and attenuation of LV filling pressure, diastolic dysfunction, and remodeling over 6 weeks. The results suggest that candesartan and enalapril during healing after RSTEMI prevent rather than worsen adverse remodeling of IZ collagens and LV diastolic dysfunction, supporting the clinical use of ARBs and ACEIs during subacute RSTEMI.",

    "274": "No consistent or conclusive evidence has been found that hyperglycemia or diabetes mellitus in association with thiazide diuretic use is associated with increased cardiovascular disease outcomes. This benign outcome may be a consequence of the fact that only a segment of such diuretic-associated cases is induced by the usual etiologic mechanisms that are associated with classic 'diabetes mellitus'. Likewise, no evidence has been found that the glucose-lowering effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is associated with decreased cardiovascular disease risk.", 
    "275": "We conclude that thiazide diuretics are safe to use, even in hypertensive individuals at risk for incident glucose disorders. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for protection against glucose disorders and subsequent cardiovascular disease remains to be determined.", 
    "276": "Arterial blood pressure is a major determinant of renal and cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic nephropathy. There is a proportional relationship between the systolic blood pressure and renal and mortality outcomes. Decreasing the diastolic pressure does not significantly decrease these outcomes. Irrespective of the magnitude of pretreatment systolic hypertension in the patient with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, the systolic pressure achieved with antihypertensive therapy is the important determinant of renal and cardiovascular risk. Achieving a lower systolic pressure down to 120 mm Hg is associated with substantial risk reduction. Although the data are limited, systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg may be associated with increased all-cause mortality in this patient population, increasing the possibility of a J-curve response. A marked decrease in diastolic pressure, which is a danger when undertaking aggressive therapy with the goal of decreasing the systolic pressure to 130 mm Hg, can be associated with an increased risk of cardiac events. The renoprotective and proteinuria-decreasing effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers recommend these agents as the standard of care in type 2 diabetic nephropathy. In addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blocker therapy, controlling the systolic blood pressure in this difficult to control patient population may require the use of 3 or more antihypertensive agents.", 
    "277": "Both renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is increased markedly in patients with type 2 diabetes. Besides the classic risk factors and markers such as glucose, blood pressure, blood lipid profile, and lifestyle (smoking, overweight), novel risk markers are identified, among them urine albumin excretion. Levels of urinary albumin excretion greater than normal are observed frequently in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moderately increased levels of albuminuria, so-called microalbuminuria, are predictive both for progressive renal function loss to diabetic nephropathy, and for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality: the higher the albuminuria level, the more chance of renal and cardiovascular complications. More advanced levels of albuminuria (overt albuminuria) are observed in patients in the diabetic nephropathy state. In this condition, renal and cardiovascular risk are extremely high, and again one may observe that the level of albumin excretion is predictive of renal and cardiovascular outcome. Several drug strategies decrease the level of urinary albumin excretion in type 2 diabetic patients. Data on using drugs that intervene in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) are the most extensive and conclusive. RAAS intervention is a very effective strategy to decrease the amount of albumin in the urine, independent from the blood pressure decreasing characteristics of the treatment. RAAS intervention is associated with long-term renal and cardiovascular protection. Importantly, the degree of short-term albuminuria decrease is associated with the degree of renal and cardiovascular protection: the more albuminuria reduction, the more protection. The protective predictive power of the albuminuria effect of RAAS intervention is not related to (or dissociated from) the blood pressure decreasing effect of these drugs. The protective effect of RAAS intervention is present at normoalbuminuric, microalbuminuric, and overt albuminuria levels. This makes albuminuria a target for therapy in type 2 diabetes. New drug strategies that decrease or prevent albuminuria without affecting other risk factors currently are being tested, and not only will add to underscoring the need to treat albuminuria as a separate target, but also will assist in reducing the enormous residual risk burden of individual diabetic patients.", 
    "278": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has key regulatory functions for blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. In addition, dysregulation of the system can have maladaptive effects to promote tissue injury in chronic diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, and kidney disease. These actions for the RAS to promote disease pathogenesis are especially apparent in diabetic nephropathy, the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. Evidence of a role for the RAS in diabetic nephropathy comes from studies in animal models and randomized clinical trials showing efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers to slow the progression of renal disease. Widespread applications of these therapies to a range of renal diseases may have contributed to the recent reduction in the incidence rates for end-stage renal disease. We provide a general review of the RAS and its role in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "279": "The proton-coupled uptake of di- and tri-peptides is the major route of dietary nitrogen absorption in the intestine and of reabsorption of filtered protein in the kidney. In addition, the transporters involved, PepT1 (SLC15a1) and PepT2 (SLC15a2), are responsible for the uptake and tissue distribution of a wide range of pharmaceutically important compounds, including beta-lactam antibiotics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, anti-cancer and anti-viral drugs. PepT1 and PepT2 are large proteins, with over 700 amino acids, and to date there are no reports of their crystal structures, nor of those of related proteins from lower organisms. Therefore there is virtually no information about the protein 3-D structure, although computer-based approaches have been used to both model the transmembrane domain (TM) layout and to produce a substrate binding template. These models will be discussed, and a new one proposed from homology modeling rabbit PepT1 to the recently crystallized bacterial transporters LacY and GlpT. Understanding the mechanism by which PepT1 and PepT2 bind and transport their substrates is of great interest to researchers, both in academia and in the pharmaceutical industries.", 
    "280": "Captopril is effective in the treatment of hypertension of all grades of severity. H2-receptors antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. In view of the fact that, simultaneous administration of both drugs may alter the antihypertensive effect of captopril, present paper deals with the in vitro availability studies of captopril in presence of commonly used H2-receptor antagonists like cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine. In order to simulate various pH levels in GI tract and to find out the kinetics and energetics of captopril-H2-receptor antagonist interactions, these studies were carried out in buffers of pH 4, 7.4 and 9 at 37 degrees C and at elevated temperatures. These studies clearly indicate that most of the H2-receptor antagonists bind to captopril, forming charge-transfer complexes. As a result, the availability of captopril was affected by the concurrent administration of H2-receptor antagonists. Accordingly coadministration of both the drugs should be avoided.", 
    "281": "The renin-angiotensin system is a major regulatory system of cardiovascular and renal function. Basic research has revealed exciting new aspects, which could lead to novel or modified therapeutic approaches. Renin-angiotensin system blockade exerts potent antiatherosclerotic effects, which are mediated by their antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and oxidative stress lowering properties. Inhibitors of the system-ie, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, are now first-line treatments for hypertensive target organ damage and progressive renal disease. Their effects are greater than expected by their ability to lower blood pressure alone. Angiotensin receptor blockers reduce the frequency of atrial fibrillation and stroke. Renin-angiotensin system blockade delays or avoids the onset of type 2 diabetes and prevents cardiovascular and renal events in diabetic patients. Thus, blockade of this system will remain a cornerstone of our strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk.", 
    "282": "There are many causes of sudden death ranging from accidents and suicide to vascular events and arrhythmias. Most sudden deaths will occur in people who have not been diagnosed with a serious heart condition but at a very low annual rate. Many of these events are probably vascular and might be prevented by reducing the risk of developing coronary disease. Only a minority of sudden deaths occur in people with established cardiac disease, but in patients with major structural heart disease, the annual rate is high. The causes of sudden death are many in this clinical setting also, but dominated by ventricular arrhythmias and vascular events. There is good evidence that conventional treatments for heart failure, including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and cardiac resynchronization devices reduce the risk of sudden death. Evidence that statins, aspirin or revascularisation are safe or effective in patients with heart failure is currently lacking. Implantable defibrillators confer a small but definite additional survival advantage by treating arrhythmias that have not been prevented.", 
    "283": "Hypertrophic scars and keloids are 2 forms of excessive cutaneous scarring that occur in predisposed individuals. The healing process varies greatly among patients, and the risk of a bad scar evolution is unpredictable. Keloids create disfiguring scars with associated erythema and pain or pruritus or restricted range of motion, and are a major cause of morbidity. A fortuitous observation was made by the first author of this study who, at age 54, developed an erythematous and painful postsurgical abdominal keloid scar after undergoing left colectomy for colon adenocarcinoma. Four months later, after treatment with low-dose enalapril (10 mg, once a day) for mild arterial hypertension, her keloid scar rapidly improved and she eventually made a complete recovery. second case involved a 70-year-old female with diabetes who was affected by a long-standing postsurgical abdominal keloid scar of 2 years' duration. She was intentionally treated with the same low dose of enalapril, and, after 6 months of therapy, the bad scar showed marked improvement. We conducted an exhaustive search of the literature pertaining to the wound healing process, specifically to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a healing effect on wounds. ACE inhibitors are known to induce reduction of left ventricular collagen content and to attenuate remodeling during the postinfarctual period (thus improving ventricular function), and they have been shown to exert a pulmonary antifibrotic effect. After conducting this literature search, it became apparent that no data on cutaneous scars and ACE inhibitors are available. During the posttraumatic or postoperative stage, it is useful to achieve the best possible aesthetic results and to decrease the risk of a disfiguring keloid scar, thereby avoiding revision surgery; to this purpose, an early treatment with a low dose of enalapril is a possible solution, even if further confirmatory observations are needed.", 
    "284": "In recent studies, benefit has been shown for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists over a beta-blocker in hypertension, through a greater reduction in aortic than brachial systolic and pulse pressure. No data are available on diuretics, even though these are the preferred initial treatment of patients with mild hypertension.", 
    "285": "In this study, 101 patients with mild essential hypertension were randomly assigned to an 8-week period of monotherapy with enalapril 10 mg a day or indapamide 2.5 mg a day. Central as well as brachial systolic, augmented, and pulse pressure were determined using SphygmoCor, as in the REASON and CAFE trials.", 
    "286": "Enalapril and indapamide reduced brachial systolic, diastolic, mean and pulse pressure to the same extent, and the heart rate was unchanged. Although there was no difference in brachial pressure with enalapril and indapamide, enalapril caused a greater fall in estimated aortic systolic, and pulse pressures. The augmentation index, an index of wave reflection, fell from 33.7 to 28.3% with enalapril but was unchanged with indapamide.", 
    "287": "Results infer a reduction in wave reflection with enalapril, causing a fall in aortic pressure augmentation, and a corresponding fall in aortic systolic and pulse pressure. These were not apparent from brachial cuff measurements. Results show that a diuretic, like a beta-blocker agent, is not as effective a therapy as an ACE inhibitor in reducing aortic systolic and pulse pressure, and that the difference is not attributable to a change in heart rate.",

    "290": "From a total of 146 838 individuals with high blood pressure or an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, 22 666 major cardiovascular events were documented during follow-up. The analyses showed comparable blood pressure-dependent reductions in risk with ACEI and ARB (P >or= 0.3 for all three outcomes). The analyses also showed that ACEI produced a blood pressure-independent reduction in the relative risk of CHD of approximately 9% (95% confidence interval 3-14%). No similar effect was detected for ARB, and there was some evidence of a difference between ACEI and ARB in this regard (P = 0.002). For both stroke and heart failure there was no evidence of any blood pressure-independent effects of either ACEI or ARB.",

    "292": "The effect of captopril, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on angiogenesis in several reports remained unclear. Its effect on neovascularization in rat abdominal skin flaps was investigated. Flap elevation, based on the right superficial inferior epigastric artery was performed with or without the administration of captopril (10 mg/kg/d), Ang II (100 microg/kg/d), or captopril and Ang II cotreatment. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), microangiography, capillary density measurement, necrosis area determination, laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), AT1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immunostaining were used to evaluate the effects of captopril and the interaction between captopril and Ang II on the angiogenesis. Ang II and captopril cotreatment improved angiogenesis more than Ang II or captopril alone. The reduction of necrosis, enhancement of vascular network formation, capillary density, VEGF immunostaining, and local blood flow were evident in the cotreated group. We suggest that Ang II and captopril cotreatment improves ischemia-induced angiogenesis and increased viability and vascularity of skin flap in rats.", 
    "293": "Head-up tilt testing is an important tool in the diagnosis of syncope. Several different protocols are in use. We describe the case of a 70-year-old Italian woman admitted to our observation. The patient was in antihypertensive treatment with carvedilol and with a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. A simplified Italian protocol head-up tilt testing was performed. A 4.10 s pause with syncope and a profound hypotension (blood pressure values were 65/50 mm Hg) were observed after 3 min in the provocation phase. Second-degree atrioventricular Block of the 2:1 form, advanced second-degree atrioventricular block and junctional escape rhythm (28 bpm) were observed. A simplified Italian protocol head-up tilt testing was performed after 40 days of withdrawal of carvedilol. A 2 s pause with presyncope and a hypotension (blood pressure values were 80/70 mm Hg) were observed after 2 min in the provocation phase. ECG revealed a bradycardic sinusal rhythm with heart rate of 42 bpm. This case assesses the importance of a pharmacological washout for the correct evaluation of the head-up tilt testing.", 
    "294": "In this work, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and radical-scavenging activities of the beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg)-derived peptides WY f(19-20), WYS f(19-21), WYSL f(19-22), WYSLA f(19-23), WYSLAM f(19-24), and WYSLAMA f(19-25) have been determined. The ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50) varied from 38.3 to 90.4 microM, with the exception of WYS (>500 microM). All beta-Lg-derived peptides also exhibited radical-scavenging activity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values ranged from 4.45 to 7.67 micromol Trolox equivalents/micromol of peptide). The presence and position of amino acids Trp, Tyr, and Met were proposed to be responsible for the antioxidant activity. The equimolar amino acid mixtures of all the peptides showed ORAC values lower than those of the corresponding peptides, indicating that the peptidic bond or the structural conformation had a positive influence on this activity. Finally, positive antioxidant effects of WYS, WYSL, and WYLA with ascorbic acid were observed, whereas WY and WYSLAM showed negative effects, both cases for different molar ratio mixtures. These results should be taken into account in the development of new food ingredients on the basis of peptides from beta-Lg.",

Administration of captopril (20 microg/kg) served as the control. In vitro 0.0-2.0 mg/ml FA-I was added to a mixture of ACE and hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine and assayed by a modification of the colourimetric method of Hurst and Lovell-Smith. All blood pressure measurements were monitored by the Macintosh MacLab set-up. ACE activity was measured by an in vitro assay in which the enzymatic cleavage of hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine to form histidyl-leucine and hippurate was determined colourimetrically by a cyanuric chloride/dioxane reagent.",

Furthermore, FA-I at 10 mg/kg strongly inhibited the angiotensin I-induced rise in MAP (p < 0.01). This response was comparable to that of captopril at 20 microg/kg. In the in vitro assay, ACE activity was inhibited with an IC(50) of 0.8 mg/ml. The qualitative phytochemical analysis of FA-I indicated the presence of glycoconjugates and peptides.",

    "299": "This study was performed to determine whether adult male patients with Fabry disease who demonstrate a continuing decline in renal function despite 2 to 4 yr of conventionally dosed agalsidase alfa therapy (0.2 mg/kg every other week [EOW]) show an improved slope of decline with weekly administration using the same dosage. Eleven (27%) of 41 adult male patients with Fabry disease who participated in long-term agalsidase alfa clinical trials and who had demonstrated a slope of decline in estimated GFR (eGFR) of > or =5 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)/yr while receiving long-term treatment with agalsidase alfa at the currently recommended dosage of 0.2 mg/kg, infused EOW, were enrolled in this open-label, prospective study. Patients were switched from EOW to weekly infusions and followed for an additional 24 mo. Before switching to weekly dosing, eGFR was 53.7 +/- 6.3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (mean +/- SEM), and mean rate of change in eGFR was -8.0 +/- 0.8 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)/yr. During the 24-mo follow-up period after switching to weekly dosing, the mean rate of change in eGFR was observed to slow to -3.3 +/- 1.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/yr (P = 0.01 versus EOW). After switching to weekly dosing, three patients demonstrated an improvement in eGFR and six patients demonstrated a slowing in the rate of eGFR decline; only two patients failed to improve their eGFR slope. A multiple regression model confirmed that the weekly infusion regimen was the strongest explanatory variable for the change in eGFR (P = 0.0008), with a weaker contribution from the concomitant use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (P = 0.02). These results suggest that weekly infusions of agalsidase alfa at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg may be beneficial in the subgroup of patients who have Fabry disease and whose kidney function continues to decline after 2 to 4 yr or more of standard EOW dosing.", 
    "300": "Endothelial dysfunction contributes significantly to acute renal failure (ARF) during inflammatory diseases including septic shock. Previous studies have shown that activated protein C (APC) exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and modulates endothelial function. Therefore, we investigated the effect of APC on ARF in a rat model of endotoxemia. Rats subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment exhibited ARF as illustrated by markedly reduced peritubular capillary flow and increased serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Using quantitative two-photon intravital microscopy, we observed that at 3 h post-LPS treatment, rat APC (0.1 mg/kg iv bolus) significantly improved peritubular capillary flow [288 +/- 15 microm/s (LPS) vs. 734 +/- 59 microm/s (LPS+APC), P = 0.0009, n = 6], and reduced leukocyte adhesion (P = 0.003) and rolling (P = 0.01) compared with the LPS-treated group. Additional experiments demonstrated that APC treatment significantly improved renal blood flow and reduced serum BUN levels compared with 24-h post-LPS treatment. Biochemical analysis revealed that APC downregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA levels and NO by-products in the kidney. In addition, APC modulated the renin-angiotensin system by reducing mRNA expression levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE1), angiotensinogen, and increasing ACE2 mRNA levels in the kidney. Furthermore, APC significantly reduced ANG II levels in the kidney compared with the LPS-treated group. Taken together, these data suggest that APC can suppress LPS-induced ARF by modulating factors involved in vascular inflammation, including downregulation of renal iNOS and ANG II systems. Furthermore, the data suggest a potential therapeutic role for APC in the treatment of ARF.", 
    "301": "Angiotensin II and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have analgesic, anticonvulsant and antidepressive effects and in some cases they can antagonize morphine. In the present study effects of angiotensin II and ACE inhibitor captopril administered intracerobroventricularily (icv) on conditioned place preference induced by morphine as well as on morphine withdrawal signs has been evaluated in rats. Icv canullas were implanted in anesthetized male rats. Rats were allowed to recover from the surgery and conditioned place preference was induced by morphine, and the time spent in morphine compartment was compared in saline, morphine, captopril and Ang II groups. Morphine withdrawal signs were compared in three other groups of rats: morphine alone, captopril+morphine and Ang II+morphine 4 days after morphine injections (three times in each day) with naloxone injection on 4th day. Results with rats conditioned place preference induced by morphine showed that icv captopril decreased significantly the time in morphine compartment (P<0.01) while Ang II had no effect. In morphine dependent rats captopril decreased some withdrawal signs after naloxone precipitation (P<0.05 and P<0.01). Ang II administration augmented some of withdrawal signs than in the morphine group (P<0.01 and P<0.001). In conclusion captopril reduced conditioned place preference induced by morphine and some withdrawal signs in morphine dependent rats.", 
    "302": "Recent experimental and clinical studies report beneficial metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs interfering with angiotensin. Antagonists at the angiotensin AT(1) receptor can reduce blood glucose and triglyceride levels. So far, there is little evidence, however, that angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists can also affect food intake. Particularly unknown is if drugs of this class can have acute effects on short term feeding. To address this issue, the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan was studied in a one-hour feeding paradigm in rats. In this study, irbesartan was investigated in comparison with fenfluramine, an established satiating drug, and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. We found a significant reduction of one-hour food intake following 100-200 mg/kg (i.p.) irbesartan. The ACE inhibitor captopril (25-100 mg/kg i.p.) remained without effect on food intake and fenfluramine showed the expected hypophagic action starting at 1 mg/kg (i.p.). The hypophagic effect of irbesartan could not be attributed to sedation or any gross effect on motor activity as determined both upon feeding and independent activity experiments. Fenfluramine (1 mg/kg) and irbesartan (100 mg/kg) did not reduce the latency to feed, but similarly reduced the eating rate at the beginning of the test meal. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates a hypophagic effect of the angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan that cannot be attributed to sedation or antidipsic effects of the drug.",

Patients in the intervention group who had experienced a claim rejection for an ARB within the first 6 months of program implementation (i.e., had had no ACEI [or ACEI/HCTZ combination] or ARB [or ARB/HCTZ] claim in the preceding 3 months) were followed for 1 year after the ARB claim rejection. The rate of initiation of ARB versus ACEI and other outcomes was compared with similar data from a health plan with approximately 2 million members that did not have a step-therapy intervention for ARBs (comparison group). Mean and median total antihypertensive drug ingredient costs per patient and per day of therapy over 12 months were analyzed for the intervention and comparison groups. One pharmacy benefit manager administered the pharmacy benefits for the intervention and comparison health plans during the entire study period from May 1, 2001, through February 28, 2004, and the drug formulary was similar for all health plans.",

After the eligibility criterion was applied, there were 6,758 intervention health plan members (0.7% of members) and 33,709 comparison health plan members (1.7% of members) in the 2 study groups. In addition to the smaller proportion of total members affected by the intervention in the ARB step-therapy health plans, a smaller proportion of ARB/ACEI patients attempted to obtain an ARB (1,296/6,758 or 19.2%) compared with the health plan without step therapy (8,697/33,709 or 25.8%, P <0.001). Of the 1,296 patients who attempted to obtain an ARB and were rejected in the step-therapy group, 578 patients (44.6%) went through the prior-authorization process and received an ARB as initial therapy, 632 patients (48.8%) received other antihypertensive therapy, and 86 patients (6.6%) did not receive any antihypertensive therapy within the 12-month follow-up period. In the 12 months of follow-up, 51.1% (323/632) of patients in the intervention group who received other antihypertensives as index therapy switched to or added an ARB, and 1,234 of total ACE/ARB patients (n = 6,758, 18.3%) received ARB therapy in the health plan with step therapy compared with 10,498 of 33,709 total ACEI/ARB patients (31.1%) who received ARB therapy in the health plan without step therapy. The mean antihypertensive drug cost per patient was lower in the intervention group ($370.00) than in the comparison group ($445.12; P <0.001), and the average cost per day of antihypertensive drug therapy was 12.8% lower in the step-therapy group ($0.82) than in the comparison group ($0.94).

This protocol describes a fluorescent assay for measuring ACE activity in vitro with high precision and sensitivity. The method relies on the ability of ACE to hydrolyse the internally quenched fluorescent substrate o-aminobenzoylglycyl-p-nitro-L-phenylalanyl-L-proline. The generation of the fluorescent product o-aminobenzoylglycine can be continuously monitored, preferably using a microtiter-plate fluorometer, though the use of a conventional cuvette fluorometer would also be possible. The method has important advantages with respect to other assays, because it involves only a one-step reagent, is easy to carry out and allows the analysis of an elevated number of samples in shorter times. It can be completed in one and a half hours. In addition, the fact that all reagents are commercially available allows the rapid introduction of the assay into the laboratory.", 
    "310": "This year, several studies performed were justified by the increasing importance of diastolic dysfunction, while the systolic dysfunction remains stable. Its prognosis, previously considered as benign, is similar to heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Studies are difficult in this field and we are often satisfied by imperfect results: PEP CHF, limited by the enrollment issue, showed only a trend for a beneficial effect of ACE-inhibitors. However the study can be considered as significant if only limited to the first year of follow-up, which can be justified. The second major field of research is resynchronization therapy: echocardiographic studies keep on providing asynchrony criteria. The benefit is greater in case of less extended fibrosis, and if the heart disease is non-ischemic, and if the paced zone does not contain fibrosis. Finally, a promising study on the interest of left ventricular discharge by a long-term circulatory assistance in case of severe systolic dysfunction should be cited.", 
    "311": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) remains an under-diagnosed affection, and the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a simple diagnostic method, is poorly known and seldom used, and the vascular patient's prescription list is frequently insufficient regarding results obtained in large trials with good methodology. The French ATTEST study underlines the fact that ABI is measured in less than 1 out of 3 patients with PAD. In ATTEST study, less than 10% have the triple therapy validated in PAD : antiplatelet drugs, statins and ACE-inhibitors. The international REACH registry included more than 60 000 patients suffering from atherosclerosis, including 8 000 cases with PAD. This survey evidences that in PAD patients, the annual cardiovascular complication rate is significantly higher than in patients with coronary artery disease (18 vs 13%); again PAD appears systematically under-treated when compared to CAD. These epidemiological surveys highlight the importance of screening of atherosclerotic lesions with the aim of setting an active prevention of CV complications. The new guidelines insist on the screening of PAD in patients at risk, as well as on the importance of the global management after initiating the triple therapy, independent of the CV risk factors. In a 5-year longitudinal study from an initial cohort of 2265 subjects, Aboyans et al. studied the progression of PAD by repeated measurements of ABI at the level of ankles and toes. Factors of progression for large-vessels PAD were active smoking, the total/HDL-cholesterol ratio, Lp(a) and CRP. Importantly, diabetes was not associated to the PAD progression in large vessels, but in contrast, it was the sole factor associated to the progression of PAD in small vessels. In an Austrian study published this year in the NEJM, Schillinger et al. compared balloon angioplasty versus the use of Nitinol stent for the treatment of long stenoses of the superficial femoral artery. In case of claudication, these lesions are usually treated medically, whereas surgery is required for more severe cases. The fact that stenting these long lesions of the superficial femoral artery provides benefits in terms of restenosis opens a approach for the endovascular therapy, to be confirmed by larger trials.", 
    "312": "Throughout the last decade the therapeutic approach to heart failure has undergone a considerable change. Current treatment is not just directed towards the relief of symptoms; additional objectives are prevention and progression of heart failure. Heart failure concerns not only the heart, but also the response of the body to the diminished function of the heart. Consequently the emphasis of treatment is no longer aimed solely at promoting the excretion of salt and water. Additional objectives are limitations of neuroendocrine and cytokine activation and the reversal of the extracardiac abnormalities. This paper concerns the medical treatment of heart failure according to the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology.",

Signaling through angiotensin stimulation of inflammatory cells often amplifies inflammation. Formation of Ang-II from tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been shown to be of greater importance in the development and progression of inflammatory diseases than plasma ACE.", 
    "314": "Quinapril, which is a potent and selective inhibitor of both plasma and tissue ACE, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in many disease states such as atherosclerosis, nephritis, scleroderma, diabetes and arthritis, and, thus, offers new therapeutic possibilities for disease treatment.", 
    "315": "Current guidelines for the treatment of hypertension do not provide specific recommendations for obese hypertensive patients. To identify an optimal treatment regimen for obese hypertensive patients, we studied the interactions between a drug-based weight loss approach by sibutramine and different antihypertensive drug regimens.", 
    "316": "This was a prospective, 16-week double-blind placebo-controlled randomized multicenter study in 171 obese hypertensive patients. After a 2-week run-in period, patients receiving 1 of the 3 antihypertensive combination therapies (felodipine 5 mg/ramipril 5 mg [n=57], verapamil 180 mg/trandolapril 2 mg [n=55], or metoprolol succinate 95 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg [metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide; n=59]) were assigned randomly to sibutramine (15 mg) or placebo. Sibutramine treatment resulted in a significantly greater decrease in body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference and a significant increase in diastolic blood pressure during 24-hour blood pressure monitoring compared with placebo treatment. Sibutramine-induced weight loss and reduction of visceral obesity were markedly attenuated in the metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide group compared with the other groups. Consistently, improvement in glucose tolerance and hypertriglyceridemia by sibutramine was abrogated in the cohort treated with metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide compared with the other groups.", 
    "317": "The present study demonstrates for the first time that an antihypertensive combination therapy regimen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers is more advantageous than a beta-blocker/diuretic-based regimen in supporting the weight-reducing actions and concomitant metabolic changes induced by sibutramine in obese hypertensive patients. These data may help to develop future comprehensive treatment strategies and guidelines for this high-risk patient population.", 
    "318": "The rising tide of chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially diabetic nephropathy, has become a worldwide catastrophe. However, therapeutic options to prevent or retard the progression of CKD still remain very limited. The understanding of its molecular mechanisms and the delineation of tools able to modify them are thus of critical importance. The discovery that some antihypertensive agents inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, protect the kidney opens new therapeutic perspectives. In this article, we focus on their renoprotective actions beyond blood pressure lowering.", 
    "319": "In the last years the treatment of heart failure has radically changed due to the results of multicenter clinical trials. The antagonism of neurohormonal systems has proved to be the only strategy, which favorably modifies the prognosis of the patients with heart failure. Particularly, the effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blockers has been proven in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction; more recently, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone blockers have shown to improve the outcome in heart failure. The public health im portance of translating this body of evidence of research into clinical practice is paramount. We used data from the IN-CHF registry to examine changes in the use of pharmacological treatment from 1995 to 2005. The proportion of patients receiving an ACE-inhibitor was slightly higher in the 1995-2000 than after but this difference is not statistically significant. The use of \"recommended therapies\" as beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and ARBs increased significantly in these 10 years. The use of beta-blockers also increased significantly among elderly patients and patients in advanced NYHA class. Patients treated with the combination of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs are very few (1.1%), even if this association is now recommended by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. The same analysis repeated after the CHARM and Val-HeFT publication shows that this association is used in 2.0% of the patients. The proportion of patients treated with a beta-blocker plus ACE-inhibitors plus ARB is only 0.8%. Use of digitalis and calcium channel blockers fell continuously from 1995 whereas use of diuretics and anticoagulants remained relatively constant. Statins are becoming widely used in this population (from 5 to 20%) even if the information on the effect of these drugs in heart failure is still incomplete.", 
    "320": "Several large scale clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors offer cardiovascular and renal protection independent of their effects on systolic BP. Trandolapril is a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor approved for the treatment of hypertension. The potential advantages of this drug are long duration of action and better tolerability. The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of trandolapril with that of enalapril in mild to moderate hypertension in Indian population. In this double blind, multicentric, parallel comparative clinical study, 120 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to receive trandolapril 2 mg or enalapril 5 mg once daily for 8 weeks. The attainment of sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of 8th week was considered as primary outcome measure and attainment of diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or reduction of at least 10 mmHg diastolic blood pressure compared to baseline at any visit was considered as secondary outcome measures. 98.4% patients treated with trandolapril and 92.6% patients treated with enalapril fulfilled the primary outcome measure. 54, 72 and 62% patients on trandolapril and 52, 61 & 64% patients on enalapril fulfilled secondary outcome measure at the end of 2nd, 4th and 8th week respectively. Also trandolapril was better tolerated than enalapril with no significant abnormality in lab parameters.",

Corresponding factors which influencing the mortality were also analyzed by one-way factor and multiple factors analysis methodologies.", 
    "323": "The mean age of the 1242 AMI patients was 63.0 years old and about one third of them were under 55 years old. In hospitals, the total mortality was 9.10%. 37.9% of the patients had received therapy of the intravenous thrombolysis and emergency PCI with a total rate of reperfusion therapy as 56.0%. The in-hospital rates of drug use were as follows: Nitrates 90.0%, Aspirin 87.8%, heparin 88.7%, beta-blockers 73.4%, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors(ACEI) 77.6%, lipid regulating agents 43.6%. The rate of intravenous therapy of TCM by promoting the blood circulation and supplementing the vital energy was 30.5%. Results from multiple factors analysis showed that the compositive factors which could lower the mortality were reperfusion therapy,lipid regulating agents, intravenous therapy of TCM, beta-blockers, ACEI, lower molecule heparin and digitalis.", 
    "324": "Data from this study showed that there still existed a gap between clinical management on AMI and the guideline in Beijing. To set up a straightway passage of reperfusion therapy, to become more standardized to follow the guideline in undertaking the medical treatment practice, and to go deep into discuss the status of TCM on AMI management seemed the important tasks we are facing.", 
    "325": "A substantial level of evidence supports the use of renin system blockade for many patients with hypertension. Two lines of evidence, based on very high-dose angiotensin blocker treatment or combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker, suggest that more complete blockade leads to improved clinical outcomes. The recent development of a powerful renin inhibitor that acts at the initial, rate-limiting step in the renin cascade would also favor more complete blockade of the system. For many patients, this is likely to lead to improved treatment.", 
    "326": "Aliskiren is a potent, highly specific renin inhibitor with better oral bioavailability than earlier renin inhibitors and a long plasma half-life that makes it suitable for once-daily dosing. The efficacy and safety of aliskiren in treating hypertension has been studied in clinical trials both as monotherapy, comparing it with existing antihypertensive therapies, and in combination with other antihypertensive agents, including the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, and the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. From the extensive database acquired to date, it is clear that aliskiren is an effective antihypertensive agent, with once-daily administration resulting in dose-dependent systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions. Combinations with existing antihypertensives are producing promising additional blood pressure-lowering effects.", 
    "327": "The unraveling of the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in health and disease is an example of how basic and applied scientists can decipher a complex biological system to better understand the pathophysiology of disease. Moreover, clinicians have been provided with drugs to modulate the RAS, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACE inhibitors and ARBs have revolutionized the way in which many diseases are treated, including hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and kidney disease. Yet, despite the undoubted successes of these drugs, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain high. Clearly, lower blood pressure goals may be required. Because ACE inhibitors and ARBs target specific areas of the RAS, more impressive results might be obtained with a more global reduction in RAS activity. This article examines the results of clinical trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs and assesses the potential for improving outcomes through a more global inhibition of the RAS with renin inhibitors.", 
    "328": "Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and combination therapies have been shown to reduce the cardiovascular event rate in susceptible individuals, albeit with remaining significant residual risk. Some of the sources of residual risk, such as genetics and epigenetic phenomena, are not easily modifiable. Still, the risk imposed by these factors may be lowered by implementation of dietary, behavioral, and pharmacologic interventions. Abdominal obesity has emerged as one element in the cluster of factors linked to increased propensity for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. It is a potential therapeutic target to reduce residual cardiometabolic risk. Waist circumference has been shown to be a strong correlate of abdominal obesity, and measurement is a useful tool for the assessment of cardiometabolic risk.", 
    "329": "Current treatment goals in heart failure (HF) aim to improve both survival and quality of life (QoL) of patients. In this brief communication, we reviewed randomized controlled trials that assessed the impact of pharmacological treatment on QoL, and we discussed some methodological limitations of QoL assessment in HF. Studies that assessed QoL with a disease-specific questionnaire were included. We found that at present there is a paradox in HF treatment. Life prolonging therapies, such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers improve modestly or only delay the progressive worsening of QoL in HF. Treatment with beta blockers does not affect QoL in any way. However, this neutral effect of beta blockers may also be due to some methodological limitations, such as the small number of patients included in beta blocker trials or the short duration of follow-up. Disease-specific questionnaires may also have some limitations, e.g. are not sensitive enough to detect small changes in QoL. On the other hand, therapies that significantly improve QoL in HF (e.g. inotropic agents) do not seem beneficial in relation to survival. We conclude that QoL in HF remains an open field, in which new therapies but also clarification of methodology is required. In the mean time, the use of life prolonging therapies appears as a safe measure to modestly improve or maintain QoL.", 
    "330": "The increasing prevalence and costs of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) make strategies to prevent its development vitally important. This analysis was conducted to determine if angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prevent the development of DM. Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1966 to May 2006) were queried for prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled or active-controlled trials of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in adults that reported rates of new-onset diabetes during follow-up. Meta-analyses of summary statistics from individual trials were performed using a random-effects model. Thirteen trials with a total of 93,451 patients were identified. Renin-angiotensin system antagonists reduced the incidence of DM from 9% in nontreated patients to 7.1% in those treated, a 26% reduction in odds (odds ratio [OR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 0.81, p<0.001). The effect sizes were similar in trials that randomized only hypertensive subjects (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.82, p<0.001) and trials that studied the impact of renin-angiotensin system inhibition on outcomes of patients with vascular disease or heart failure (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90, p=0.008). ACE inhibitors and ARBs had comparable effects on the development of DM. In ACE inhibitor trials, the odds of developing DM were reduced by 28% (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.84, p<0.001), and in the 5 ARB studies, there was a 27% reduction (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84, p<0.001) in the odds. In conclusion, evidence accumulated to date indicates that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system may contribute to the prevention of DM.",

Both captopril-treated groups improved EF% similarly. But only captopril plus MSC treatment almost restored cardiac function to control levels, 8 weeks after injection (60.50+/-5.40% vs. 41.00+/-4.50% in Cap.MSC and Cap respectively, P<0.05). Many DAPI-labelled cells were found in the scar tissue of the left ventricle only in the Cap.MSC group.",

    "335": "The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanism(s) of omapatrilat degradation observed during dissolution from modified release (MR) tablet formulations containing colorants. The tablets were manufactured by a dry granulation process employing roller compaction. The colorants were added intragranularly and included red and yellow iron oxides and FD&C Blue No. 2 lake and dye. Dissolution studies in pH 6 or 6.8 media do not indicate any omapatrilat degradation in the absence of colorants. In the presence of colorants the degradation rate of omapatrilat in pH 6.8 media was in the following order: blue lake>blue lake+yellow iron oxide>yellow and red iron oxides. Higher degradation was observed with MR tablets formulated with indigo carmine (dye) as opposed to tablets formulated with aluminum oxide or aluminum hydroxide (dye substrate portion of lake). The inclusion of tartaric acid and the photostabilizer, uric acid, in omapatrilat MR tablets containing the blue lake reduced the degradation significantly. The dissolution instability observed at pH 6.8 in the MR tablet formulated with FD&C Blue No. 2 Lake was attributed to the dye component of the lake. The instability was more pronounced at higher pH and in the absence of a photostabilizer.",

    "337": "We studied a family of eight members, diagnosed of Fabry disease after demonstrating alpha-galactosidase deficiency and genetic mutation. Serial biochemical analyses were performed every six months during the three years of follow-up: creatinine, urea, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, microalbuminuria, urinary sediment, blood pressure and glycemia. If urinary alterations were detected, ACE inhibitors were started. At the end of the study, a simple and Doppler ultrasonography was performed.", 
    "338": "Six of eight patients presented microalbuminuria during the follow-up. Only one of these patients did not develop proteinuria. ACE inhibitors therapy decreased proteinuria in all six patients, however, this decrease was not complete in two of them: in one proteinuria was detected and in the other microalbuminuria persisted. Kidney involvement was not dependent on enzymatic substitution therapy. Renal ultrasonography was normal in patients without biochemical sign of renal affection. In one patient with proteinuria at the moment of the ultrasonography, slightly increased resistance indexes were detected.", 
    "339": "Renal involvement is very frequent in patients with Fabry disease (in six of eight in our series). ACE inhibitors are effective in controlling proteinuria in patients with microalbuminuria y proteinuria. These data must be confirmed in larger series. Doppler ultrasonography fails in early renal involvement detection, but as it constitutes an easy and not dangerous technique, it should be done routinely in Fabry patients in order to evaluate its role in the follow-up of these patients.", 
    "340": "Available information regarding the relation among atherosclerosis, low-density lipoproteins, markers of thrombosis, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction has accumulated, but is still very limited, making only minimal contributions to clinical decision-making. Many more clinical trials are needed, but unless there is a relationship between atherosclerosis prevention, specific markers and a pharmaceutical product, financial support for such trials will be difficult to obtain. The anti-inflammatory effect of statins is well established. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are generally not thought of as having anti-inflammatory effects, but the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease (EUROPA) study observed extensive RR reduction with perindopril. It was explained not simply by control of hypertension, but by reduced activity of multiple factors, supported by specific substudies. The 'cardiovascular continuum' is an excellent unifying term to explain atherosclerosis mechanisms, relate mechanisms to clinical understanding, and assist the clinician in selecting the appropriate prevention and control therapies. This so-called continuum actually describes a relationship among different biochemical, enzymatic and hormonal factors that affect the cardiovascular system. It can be seen in the downregulation of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 by statins, which contributes to hypertension control while lowering low-density lipoproteins. Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma also demonstrates the cardiovascular continuum with activation of the receptor by glitazones. The glitazones increase insulin sensitivity for diabetes control. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma inhibits inflammation, which is possibly related to atherosclerosis, normalization of endothelial function, suppression of metalloproteinases and a decrease in smooth muscle cell migration. All of these effects may decrease atherosclerosis production while improving control of diabetes mellitus, a key disease in the cardiovascular continuum for development of atherosclerosis. Consideration of such interrelationships is just scratching the surface. Nevertheless, it can be seen that the complicated process of atherosclerosis development has a multifaceted explanation that has been minimally defined, but holds the key to prevention and control of this major medical problem faced in modern society.", 
    "341": "Nisoldipine coat-core (CC), a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of hypertension and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. The CC technology allows for extended delivery of the drug and once-daily dosing. Nisoldipine CC tablets are absorbed across the entire gastrointestinal tract, including the colon. Eighty percent of the total dose is in the slow-release outer coat, while the core has immediate-release characteristics suitable for absorption in the distal gastrointestinal tract. Numerous double-blind, randomized studies of this agent have been done in patients with hypertension. The use of nisoldipine CC reduced both clinic and ambulatory blood pressure to a similar degree when compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and the calcium antagonists amlodipine and felodipine. The drug has also been studied in hypertensive African Americans and demonstrated equivalent efficacy to amlodipine. Tolerability of the drug is good, with the most common side effect of edema at a rate similar to other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. Thus, results of more than a decade of clinical trial data support the use of nisoldipine CC as once-daily therapy for the treatment of hypertension.",

A variety of oral and parenteral therapies are approved for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy; methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine have been used safely in pregnancy, as has hydrochlorothiazide in those already taking this medication before conception. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are contraindicated in pregnancy because of adverse fetal effects, and atenolol should be avoided due to concerns with fetal growth. Severe hypertension >160/110 mmHg may require parenteral therapy, and treatment with intravenous labetalol now supplants the use of hydralazine. Women may remain hypertensive for a period postpartum and require treatment for a short interval. Early or severe preeclampsia warrants workup postpartum for secondary causes.

    "354": "Until the mid-1990s, radiation-induced normal-tissue injury was generally assumed to be solely caused by the delayed mitotic death of parenchymal or vascular cells, and these injuries were held to be progressive and untreatable. From this assumption, it followed that postirradiation interventions would be unlikely to reduce either the incidence or the severity of radiation-induced normal tissue injury. It is now clear that parenchymal and vascular cells are active participants in the response to radiation injury, an observation that allows for the possibility of pharmacologic mitigation and/or treatment of these injuries. Mitigation or treatment of chronic radiation injuries has now been experimentally shown in multiple organ systems (eg, lung, kidney, and brain), with different pharmacologic agents (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, pentoxifylline, and superoxide dismutase mimetics) and with seemingly different mechanisms (eg, suppression of the renin-angiotensin system and suppression of chronic oxidative stress). Unfortunately, the mechanistic basis for most of the experimental successes has not been established, and assessment of the utility of these agents for clinical use has been slow. Clinical development of pharmacologic approaches to mitigation or treatment of chronic radiation injuries could lead to significant improvement in survival and quality of life for radiotherapy patients and for victims of radiation accidents or nuclear terrorism.",

Strategies are needed to increase the proportion of patients who are receiving evidence-based therapies. Predischarge initiation of evidence-based therapies has effectively increased utilization in the acute coronary syndrome population. Predischarge initiation of beta-blockade in patients hospitalized for heart failure has also been shown to be safe and effective for improving beta-blocker use at 60 days. Larger registry initiatives have demonstrated improved use of evidence-based therapies associated with implementation of a performance improvement process system.

    "357": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is an increasingly common medical condition and the fastest growing cardiovascular diagnosis in North America. Over one-third of patients with heart failure also have renal insufficiency. It has been shown that renal insufficiency confers worsened outcomes to patients with heart failure. However, a majority of the larger and therapy-defining heart failure medication and device trials exclude patients with advanced renal dysfunction. These studies also infrequently perform subgroup analyses based on the degree of renal dysfunction. The lack of information on heart failure patients who have renal insufficiency likely contributes to their being prescribed mortality and morbidity reducing medications and receiving diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at lower rates than heart failure patients with normal renal function. Inclusion of patients with renal insufficiency in heart failure studies and published guidelines for medication, device, and interventional therapies would likely improve patient outcomes.", 
    "358": "This report describes a newly identified potential of grapefruit juice (GFJ) in mediating pharmacokinetic drug interactions due to its capability to inhibit esterase. The study demonstrates that GFJ inhibits purified porcine esterase activity toward p-nitrophenyl acetate and the prodrugs lovastatin and enalapril. In rat and human hepatic or gut S9 fractions and rat gut lumen, GFJ inhibited the hydrolysis of enalapril and lovastatin, which are known to be metabolized principally by esterases, lovastatin being metabolized also by CYP3A. In Caco-2 cells, with minimal CYP3A activity, permeability of these prodrugs was increased in the presence of GFJ. In rats, oral coadministration of GFJ or an esterase inhibitor, bis-(p-nitrophenylphosphate), with the prodrugs led to respective increases in plasma area under the curve by 70% or 57% for enalaprilat and 279% or 141% for lovastatin acid. In addition, portal vein-cannulated rats pretreated with GFJ at -15 and -2 h before lovastatin administration (10 mg/kg p.o.) as a solution, 1) in water and 2) in GFJ, showed, respectively, a 49% increase (CYP3A-inhibited) and a 116% increase (both CYP3A and gut esterase-inhibited) in the portal plasma exposure to the active acid, compared with a non-GFJ pretreatment group. Overall, along with the CYP3A inactivation by GFJ, the decreased esterase activity also played a significant role in increasing the metabolic stability and permeability of esters leading to enhancement of exposure to the active drugs in rats. These new esterase inhibition findings indicate that the potential of drug interaction between ester prodrugs and GFJ should also be considered in the clinic.",

The administration approach is to fill in stomach by mouth. The blood pressure value was observed for each group. The long term oral administration design was conducted for one month. Twenty four SHRs were randomized into 3 groups. The first group is the blank control, the second group is low dose (RDHP 10 mg/kg) and the third group is high dose (RDHP 20 mg/kg).

    "364": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure as well as cardiovascular function. ACE catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, and also inactivates the antihypertensive vasodilator bradykinin. Inhibition of ACE mainly results an overall antihypertensive effect. Food protein-derived peptides can have ACE-inhibiting properties and thus may be used as a novel functional food for preventing hypertension as well as for therapeutic purposes. In the present study, rice protein was hydrolyzed by protease Alcalase for 2 h and the resulted hydrolysate was determined for ACE inhibitory activity in vitro. The antihypertensive effect of rice protein hydrolysate was also investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The Alcalase-generated hydrolysate showed strong in vitro ACE inhibitory activity with the IC50 value of 0.14 mg/ml. A significant decrease in systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats was observed following single oral administration of this hydrolysate at a dose of 600 mg/kg of body weight. A potent ACE inhibitory peptide with the amino acid sequence of Thr-Gln-Val-Tyr (IC50, 18.2 microM) was isolated and identified from the hydrolysate. Single oral administration of Thr-Gln-Val-Tyr at a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight also significantly decreased blood pressure in SHR. These results suggest that in vitro ACE inhibitory activity and in vivo antihypertensive activity could be generated from rice protein by enzymatic hydrolysis. The rice protein hydrolysate prepared with Alcalase might be utilized to develop physiologically functional food with antihypertensive activity.",

However, many men with ED still report a suboptimal or partial response even after an adequate trial of oral PDE-5 therapy. Since ED is associated with impaired vascular function and both atorvastatin and quinapril have been previously shown to improve vascular function, we examined the effects of adjunctive treatment with these medications in men with vasculogenic ED who were suboptimal responders to 100 mg of sildenafil. Men with ED and suboptimal response to sildenafil were randomly assigned to 3 months of treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg (n = 12), quinapril 10 mg (n = 10), or placebo (n = 13), along with continued adjunctive sildenafil use. Measured variables included: International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), endothelium-independent dilation (EID) via nitroglycerin, penile Doppler blood flow, blood pressure (BP), lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Compared to placebo, quinapril (p < 0.01) significantly improved symptoms of ED as measured by the IIEF-5 questionnaire. There was a trend toward a significant improvement in IIEF-5 with atorvastatin. Similarly, quinapril significantly improved the IIEF ED Domain (p < 0.05). Other peripheral and penile vascular parameters were unchanged with drug therapy as compared to placebo. In conclusion, treatment with quinapril, in combination with sildenafil, improved ED in men with suboptimal response to sildenafil alone. Atorvastatin demonstrated a trend toward improved ED in this group.", 
    "370": "The pathogenesis of arterial hypertension often involves a rise in systemic vascular resistance (vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling) and impairment of salt excretion in the kidney (inappropriate salt retention despite elevated blood pressure). Experimental and clinical evidence implicate an imbalance between endogenous vasoconstrictor and vasodilator systems in the development and maintenance of hypertension. Kinins (bradykinin and lys-bradykinin) are endogenous vasodilators and natriuretic peptides known best for their ability to antagonize angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction and sodium retention. In humans, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, a potent class of antihypertensive agents, lower blood pressure at least partially by favoring enhanced kinin accumulation in plasma and target tissues. The beneficial actions of kinins in renal and cardiovascular disease are largely mediated by nitric oxide and prostaglandins, and extend beyond their recognized role in lowering blood pressure to include cardioprotection and nephroprotection. This article is a review of exciting, recently generated genetic, biochemical and clinical data from studies that have examined the importance of the tissue kallikrein-kinin system in protection from hypertension, vascular remodeling and renal fibrosis. Development of novel therapeutic approaches to bolster kinin activity in the vascular wall and in specific compartments in the kidney might be a highly effective strategy for the treatment of hypertension and its complications, including cardiac hypertrophy and renal failure.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use confers a 16-20% reduction in mortality. beta-Blocker use also confers a significant reduction in mortality, as well as reduces hospitalizations. Angiotensin II receptor blockers also reduce mortality and morbidity. Appropriate use of drugs can reduce other costs associated with heart failure.

The adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium, mediated by endothelial cell adhesion molecules including vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin, is the pivotal early event in atherogenesis. Inflammatory cytokines could activate redox-sensitive transcription factors and induce endothelial expression of adhesion molecules, which could be inhibited to various degrees by different antioxidants suggesting the potential role of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in atherogenesis. Many clinical drugs that against cardiovascular diseases have exhibited antioxidant effects; these drugs simultaneously inhibit endothelial adhesion molecule expression, such as aspirin, probucol, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma ligands, calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, etc. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that Ginkgo biloba extract, a Chinese herb with antioxidant activity, could significantly suppress inflammatory cytokine-stimulated endothelial adhesiveness to human monocytic cells by attenuating intracellular ROS formation, redox-senstive transcription factor activation, and VCAM-1 as well as ICAM-1 expression in human aortic endothelial cells. The similar anti-atherosclerosis effects have been also shown in other Chinese herbs or dietary supplements with antioxidant activity such as magnolol and salvianolic acid B either in vitro or in vivo. Thus, oxidative stress is critical to endothelial adhesiveness in atherogenesis. The inhibition of endothelial adhesion molecule expression by drugs/agents with antioxidant activity may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for clinical atherosclerosis.",

Three-month-old Wistar males treated with L-NAME (60 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks were compared to rats in which L-NAME treatment was combined with simultaneous chronic administration of captopril or NAC. Basal blood pressure (BP) and its acute responses to consecutive i.v. injections of captopril (10 mg/kg), pentolinium (5 mg/kg), L-NAME (30 mg/kg), tetraethylammonium (TEA, 16 mg/kg) and nitroprusside (NP, 20 microg/kg) were determined in conscious rats at the end of the study. The development of L-NAME hypertension was prevented by captopril treatment, whereas NAC treatment caused only a moderate BP reduction. Captopril treatment normalized the sympathetic BP component and significantly reduced residual BP (measured at full NP-induced vasodilation). In contrast, chronic NAC treatment did not modify the sympathetic BP component or residual BP, but significantly enhanced NO-dependent vasodilation. Neither captopril nor NAC treatment influenced the compensatory increase of TEA-sensitive vasodilation mediated by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor in L-NAME-treated rats. Chronic captopril treatment prevented L-NAME hypertension by lowering of sympathetic tone, whereas chronic NAC treatment attenuated L-NAME hypertension by reduction in the vasodilator deficit due to enhanced NO-dependent vasodilation.", 
    "444": "The beneficial effect achieved by the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in chronic cardiovascular diseases is already an evidence belonging to the basic treatment of the disease. Given the fact that the vascular system is uniform and consubstantial both physiologically, pathophysiologically and in terms of therapy, and that it plays a key role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - a disease leading to tragic loss of vision with its etiology and therapy being unknown -, endothelial dysfunction should be treated. The pleiotropic effects of ACE-inhibitors, AR-blockers and statins help to restitute the balance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in endothelial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress, the balance of growth factors and their inhibitors, pro- and anti-inflammatory substances and prothrombotic and fibrinolytic factors, inhibit the formation of oxidative stress and its harmful effects; while aspirin with its pleiotropic effects acting as an antiaggregation substance on platelets helps to set the endothelial layer back to its normal balance regarding its vasodilating, antithrombotic, anti-adhesive and anti-inflammatory functions. For the above reasons it is suggested that, as a part of long term primary and/or secondary prevention, the following groups of patients with AMD receive - taking into consideration all possible side effects - ACE-inhibitor and/or AR-blocker and statin and aspirin treatment: 1) those without maculopathy but being over the age of 50 and having risk factors inducing endothelial dysfunction; 2) those, who already developed AMD in one eye as a prevention in the second, unaffected eye; and 3) those patients who developed AMD in both eyes in order to ameliorate or merely slow the progression of the disease. Besides, it is advisory to inhibit AMD risk factors inducing oxidative stress with consecutive endothelial dysfunction.",

    "455": "This editorial considers the use of the first selective oral renin inhibitor, aliskiren, in reducing angiotensin (Ang) II reactivation or aldosterone (ALDO) escape during renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition. RAAS blockade with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor AT(1) blockers (ARBs) is very useful for the treatment of arterial hypertension, chronic heart failure (CHF), atherosclerosis and diabetes. 'Ang II reactivation' and 'ALDO escape' or 'breakthrough' have been observed during either ACEI or ARB treatment, and may attenuate the clinical benefit of RAAS blockade. Renin and Ang I accumulate during ACE inhibition, and might overcome the ability of an ACEI to effectively suppress ACE activity. There is also data suggesting that 30 - 40% of Ang II formation in the healthy human during RAAS activation is formed via renin-dependent, but ACE-independent, pathways. Moreover, ACE gene polymorphisms contribute to the modulation and adequacy of the neurohormonal response to long-term ACE inhibition, at least in patients with CHF (up to 45% of CHF patients have elevated Ang II levels despite the long-term use of an ACEI) or diabetes. The reactivated Ang II promotes ALDO secretion and sodium reabsorption. ALDO breakthrough also occurs during long-term ARB therapy, mainly by an AT(2)-dependent mechanism. This was related to target-organ damage in animal models. Oral renin inhibition with aliskiren has showed excellent efficacy and safety in the treatment of hypertension. Aliskiren can be co-administered with ACEIs, ARBs or hydrochlorothiazide. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that aliskiren reduces Ang II reactivation in ACE inhibition and ALDO escape during treatment with an ACEI or an ARB, at least to the degree that this is associated with the RAAS. For RAAS-independent ALDO production, the combination of aliskiren with eplerenone might prove useful.",

Laboratory investigations showed elevated sedimentation rate, hepatic cytolysis and renal impairment (hematuria, leucocyturia and proteinuria 1.5 g/24 hours). Anti-parvovirus B19 IgM were positive. Three months after the eruption resolved, IgM were undetectable while anti-parvovirus B19 IgG appeared. Renal injury progressively worsened: elevation of proteinuria (5 g/24 hours) and diminution of creatinine clearance (51 ml/min). Renal biopsy showed glomerulonephritis with mesangial IgA deposits.

They promote the development of metabolically active adipocytes that can lead to a substantial gain in fat mass. Telmisartan is an ANG II type 1 receptor antagonist with partial PPAR-gamma agonistic properties. Recently, telmisartan has been reported to prevent weight gain and improve insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese rodents. The goal of this study was to examine the influence of telmisartan on pioglitazone-induced weight gain and insulin-sensitizing properties in the following two models of insulin resistance: a nongenetic model (high-fat-fed Sprague Dawley rats) and the genetically obese fa/fa Zucker rat. After a 4-wk treatment, the pioglitazone-induced increase in fat mass was modest in the Sprague Dawley rats and severe in the Zucker rats. In both models, these effects were substantially decreased by concomitant treatment with telmisartan. The effects of telmisartan on body weight and fat mass in the Zucker rats were abolished by pair feeding, suggesting that it is the result of a decrease in food intake. Telmisartan did not interfere with the insulin-sensitizing properties of pioglitazone. This study demonstrates that telmisartan attenuates the glitazone-induced increase in fat mass without interfering with its insulin-sensitizing properties.",

The aim of this placebo-controlled crossover study was to assess the bioavailability of Ile-Pro-Pro and 7 other ACE-inhibiting peptides present in a lactotripeptide (LTP)-enriched yogurt beverage and whether meal intake affects Ile-Pro-Pro bioavailability. Six male and female subjects randomly consumed an LTP-enriched yogurt beverage or a placebo in the fasted state and an LTP-enriched yogurt beverage in the fed or fasted state. The area under the curve (AUC) of Ile-Pro-Pro after the LTP treatment in the fasted state was 2.1-fold of that after the placebo treatment (P < 0.001). The maximum peptide plasma concentration (C(max)) value was greater after consumption of the LTP-enriched beverage (897 +/- 157 pmol/L) than after the placebo treatment (555 +/- 0.09 pmol/L; P < 0.001) with a greater time after ingestion when reaching C(max) (T(max)) in the placebo treatment. Plasma concentrations of the peptides Leu-Trp, Phe-Tyr, Ile-Tyr, and Leu-Pro-Pro increased compared with baseline (P < 0.05) in the LTP-enriched and placebo treatment when consumed in the fasted state. However, DeltaC(max) values differed significantly between the placebo and LTP-enriched treatment only for Leu-Pro-Pro. Meal intake affected Ile-Pro-Pro concentrations. When the beverage was consumed after a meal, the AUC of Ile-Pro-Pro was 1.3-fold (P < 0.05) of the AUC derived from premeal intake. This was due to an increase in the plasma elimination half-life (P < 0.05); C(max) and T(max) were not affected by meal intake. In summary, this is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that the tripeptide Ile-Pro-Pro selectively escapes from intestinal degradation and reaches the circulation undegraded.", 
    "462": "It has been known for many years that plasma and tissues contain a variety of enzymes capable of metabolizing kinins. The aim of the present study was to evaluate, by means of functional studies in a capacitance vessel such as the human umbilical vein (HUV), the possible role played by the metallopeptidases angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), neutral endopeptidase (NEP), and aminopeptidase M (APM) as an inactivating pathway of the B(1) receptor endogenous agonist des-Arg(10)-kallidin (DAKD). In HUV rings with and without endothelium, concentration-response curves (CRCs) to DAKD were determined after a 300-min incubation period, and enzymatic inhibitors were added to the organ baths 30 min before construction of the CRC. Presence of endothelial layer was confirmed by histological studies. There was a significant leftward shift observed in control HUV rings devoid of endothelium compared with intact tissues. Exposure to 1 microM captopril (ACE inhibitor) potentiated DAKD-elicited vasoconstrictor responses in HUV rings with endothelium while no such effect was observed in tissues devoid of endothelium. Application of 10 microM amastatin (APM inhibitor) induced a leftward shift of DAKD-elicited contractile responses in HUV with and without endothelium. On the other hand, 10 microM phosphoramidon (NEP inhibitor) showed no potentiating effect in HUV rings either with or without endothelium. However, under concurrent inhibition of ACE, NEP and APM, there was a higher potentiation of DAKD-elicited contractile responses compared with the effect observed with combined inhibition of ACE and APM. Moreover, when we evaluated contractile responses induced by Sar(0)-D-Phe(8)-des-Arg(9)-BK (a metabolically protected B(1) receptor agonist), no potentiating effect was observed under triple enzymatic inhibition. In conclusion, in the present study for the first time, we demonstrated in a capacitance vessel, HUV, that metallopeptidases ACE, NEP and APM represent a relevant functional inactivation pathway of DAKD.", 
    "463": "Data supporting the prognostic significance of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are derived largely from individuals with no overt coronary artery disease or from patients with acute coronary syndromes. In contrast, the ability of hs-CRP to predict outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease and the prognostic significance of the Centers for Disease Control/American Heart Association hs-CRP cut points in such a population remain relatively unexplored.", 
    "464": "We measured hs-CRP in 3771 patients with stable coronary artery disease from the Prevention of Events With Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril. Patients were followed up for a median of 4.8 years for cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, as well as new heart failure and diabetes. After adjustment for baseline characteristics and treatments, higher hs-CRP levels, even >1 mg/L, were associated with a significantly greater risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hs-CRP 1 to 3 mg/L: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.81; P=0.016; hs-CRP >3 mg/L: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.02; P=0.003). Similarly, elevated hs-CRP levels were an independent predictor of new heart failure (adjusted P<0.001 for trend) and new diabetes (adjusted P<0.001 for trend). There were no significant interactions between hs-CRP levels and the effects of trandolapril on any of the above outcomes.", 
    "465": "In stable coronary artery disease, an elevated hs-CRP level, even >1 mg/L, is a significant predictor of adverse cardiovascular events independently of baseline characteristics and treatments.

Recent data have shown that the CYP3A5 genotypes influence blood pressure and that permeability-glycoprotein activity might influence the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Hence, these 2 genes may contribute to blood pressure regulation in humans. We analyzed the association of variants of the ABCB1 and CYP3A5 genes with ambulatory blood pressure, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, endogenous lithium clearance, and blood pressure response to treatment in 72 families (373 individuals; 55% women; mean age: 46 years) of East African descent. The ABCB1 and CYP3A5 genes interact with urinary sodium excretion in their effect on ambulatory blood pressure (daytime systolic: P=0.05; nighttime systolic and diastolic: P<0.01), suggesting a gene-gene-environment interaction. The combined action of these genes is also associated with postproximal tubular sodium reabsorption, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and with an altered blood pressure response to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (P<0.05). This is the first reported association of the ABCB1 gene with blood pressure in humans and demonstration that genes encoding for proteins metabolizing and transporting drugs and endogenous substrates contribute to blood pressure regulation.",

Patients were treated for 3 months with metoprolol (n = 18, 100 mg/day), amlodipine (n = 20, 10 mg/day), doxazosin (n = 18, 4 mg/day), ramipril (n = 20, 5 mg/day) and valsartan (n = 20, 80 mg/day). Blood biochemistry and plasma adiponectin concentrations were measured both before and after the study. Insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis assessment index (HOMA).",

The independent predictors of plasma adiponectin levels were HOMA (beta = -0.199, P = 0.02), body mass index (beta = -0.313, P < 0.001) and systolic blood pressures (beta = -0.483, P < 0.001). Ramipril and valsartan increased the plasma adiponectin levels significantly higher than the other regimens (P < 0.05 for both) while metoprolol did not make a significant effect.",

The effects of antihypertensive drugs on plasma adiponectin levels are parallel to their effects on blood pressures and insulin sensitivities. The different effects of several regimens on plasma adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivities may account for the diversity of the cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension.",

Cases for this study were lisinopril ingestions by children age < or =5 years reported to Texas poison control centers during 1998-2005. The percentage of cases involving serious medical outcomes was identified for selected variables and evaluated for statistical significance by calculating the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Of 691 total cases, 26 (3.8%) involved a serious outcome. Higher serious outcome rates were found with a maximum dose of >4 mg/kg (RR: 2.54, CI: 0.05-25.62), or >80 mg (RR: 7.85; CI: 1.73-29.29), or five or more tablets (RR: 8.18; CI: 2.73-22.54), or the patient was already at or en route to a health care facility when the poison control center was contacted (RR: 13.93; CI: 3.68-77.78), or referred to a health care facility by the poison control center (RR: 33.49; CI: 9.04-194.94). The management of patients with severe outcomes was more likely to involve health care facilities. This information is useful for drafting triage guidelines for the management of pediatric lisinopril ingestions.", 
    "472": "Considering the increasing incidence of diabetic nephropathy and its serious complications, the prevention of nephropathy evolution risk in diabetic patients is the subject of several recently initiated studies. In diabetic patients with advanced nephropathy, the lowering of proteinuria by renin angiotensin system blockers induces an evolution risk reduction, which can be further improved by increasing the dose of angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARA II). Such a synergy can be also obtained with the association of an ARA II and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, provided that the diuretic dose given to the patient is increased. In terms of cardiovascular risk, diabetic patients benefit from this type of treatment, as cardiovascular events increase with the level of proteinuria. In micro-albuminuria patients, sufficient doses of ARA II or ACE inhibitors are needed to avoid relapse after treatment discontinuation. In normo-albuminuria patients also, the treatment with a renin angiotensin system blocker significantly decreases the risk of development of microalbuminuria. Thus, the reduction of proteinuria or the prevention of its appearance with renin angiotensin system blockers is the main therapeutic strategy to prevent the evolution of nephropathy in diabetic patients.",

ALT levels were also lower (109.8 +/- 62.5 U/L vs. 166.0+/-169.5 in normotensive; P < 0.001) as were endothelin-1 levels (0.74 +/- 0.97 vs. 1.77 +/- 1.51 fmol/mL; P < 0.001). The retrospective study confirmed an older age at diagnosis in patients with treated hypertension (48.7 +/- 9.8 vs. 41.9 +/- 11.8 years; P < 0.001) and lower death rates (2.2% vs. 11%; P < 0.05).",

Post-LVAD, Ang II was reduced in the ACE-I group but increased in control subjects (181 +/- 7 fmol/g vs. 262 +/- 41 fmol/g; p < 0.05). Similarly, cross-linked collagen decreased during LVAD support in the ACE-I group. Left ventricular (LV) mass and myocardial stiffness were lower in the ACE-I group. ACE-I normalized the LV and right ventricular (RV) MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio. Collagen content and characteristics of the RV were not affected by ACE-I.",

Among the 376 genes that were differentially expressed between untreated diabetic and control hearts included key metabolic enzymes that account for the decreased glucose and increased free fatty acid utilization in the diabetic heart. ICT or insulin replacements reversed these gene changes with normalization of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and cardiac PKC activation in diabetic rats. Surprisingly, both ruboxistaurin and ACE inhibitors improved the metabolic gene profile (confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and protein analysis) and ameliorated PKC activity in diabetic hearts without altering circulating metabolites. Functional assessments using Langendorff preparations and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a 36% decrease in glucose utilization and an impairment in diastolic function in diabetic rat hearts, which were normalized by all three treatments. In cardiomyocytes, PKC inhibition attenuated fatty acid-induced increases in the metabolic genes PDK4 and UCP3 and also prevented fatty acid-mediated inhibition of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation. Thus, PKCbeta or ACE inhibitors may ameliorate cardiac metabolism and function in diabetes partly by normalization of fuel metabolic gene expression directly in the myocardium.",

Many enzymes are involved in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sources of cardiovascular drugs. Taking the antihypertensive drugs as an example, the variability in blood pressure response is very high in different individuals, some of them having an increase in blood pressure. The most important proteins involved in the patient response to a drug are cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and the ABCB1 transporter. These enzymes, at the origin of important side effects or drug interactions, are responsible, at a great extent, of the cardiovascular drug response variability. Genotyping of the most important CYP today is easy while no reliable tool has been developed for the ABC transporters ATPase dependent and linked to the other phase I and phase II enzymes. The second relevant group of enzymes are involved in pharmacodynamic action of cardiovascular drugs: enzymes of the renin-angiotensin system and enzymes of the lipid metabolism. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is the most studied target with a relevant insertion deletion polymorphism. Contradictory reported data could be explained by ethnic differences or patient sample size which are often too small.",

Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, is characterised in part by the deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the brain. Reduction of Abeta load is now a major therapeutic strategy. In recent years the renin-angiotensin system, already of recognised importance in the pathogenesis of hypertension, has become a source of interest in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This review explores molecular, genetic, and clinical studies that might help explain the relation between the renin-angiotensin system, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease and whether treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and similar treatment strategies have a part to play in the management of the disease.", 
    "500": "Renal tubulointerstitial injury plays an important role in the development of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of glomerulonephritis. Few currently in use biomarkers can sensitively detect the earliest signs of renal tubular injury, hindering our efforts to launch preventive and therapeutic measures for this disorder in a timely manner. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is an acute phase protein that is rapidly released from not only neutrophils but also a variety of cell types upon inflammation and tissue injury. Its small molecular size and protease resistance could render it an excellent biomarker of renal injury in IgAN. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by measuring urinary levels of NGAL, creatinine and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) in 40 healthy individuals and 70 IgAN patients with various disease severities. The urinary NGAL levels and NGAL/creatinine values were significantly upregulated in Lee grade III IgAN patients, in correlation with progressive glomerular mesangial proliferation and tubulointerstitial injury. Compared with urinary NAG levels, the urinary NGAL levels elevated much more drastically and can be readily detected even in Lee grade II IgAN patients when their NAG levels showed almost no change. Our findings suggest the promising use of urinary NGAL as an early biomarker for tubulointerstitial injury of IgA nephropathy and perhaps other types of renal disease in general.", 
    "501": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is strongly associated with atherosclerosis in the coronary and carotid arteries, leading to a highly increased incidence of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and cardiovascular death. Fortunately, pharmacological interventions in large clinical trials have been as effective in subgroups of patients with PAD as in subjects with other atherosclerotic disease. Antiplatelet treatment is indicated in virtually all patients with PAD. Aspirin 75-325 mg day(-1) is considered as first-line treatment, and clopidogrel 75 mg day(-1) is an effective alternative. Statin therapy is indicated to achieve a target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of < or = 2.5 mmol L(-1) in patients with PAD and there is emerging evidence that even lower levels are beneficial. Lowering of plasma homocysteine by supplementing folic acid, vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(6) is not recommended in patients with mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia in the 12-25 micromol L(-1) range, since it does not reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. Antihypertensive treatment is indicated to achieve a goal blood pressure of < or = 140/90 mmHg or < or = 130/80 mmHg in the presence of diabetes or chronic kidney disease. All classes of antihypertensive drugs are acceptable for treatment of hypertension in patients with PAD, but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ramipril or perindopril are especially appropriate because they reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events beyond their blood pressure-lowering effects. Beta-blockers should not be used as first-line antihypertensive treatment. Diabetic patients with PAD should reduce their glycosylated haemoglobin to < or = 7%. In conclusion, pharmacological secondary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with PAD should be as comprehensive as that in patients with established coronary or cerebrovascular disease.",

The patient was intubated bronchoscopically and treated unsuccessfully with cortisone, fresh plasma und C1-esterase inhibitor.

We analyzed our longitudinal data on MA/P in children with sickle cell disease (SS) to define the age of onset, association with age, sex, and hemoglobin, and to explore the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy. Data on 191 patients with SS (ages 3 to 20 y) with a mean follow up of 2.19 years+/-2.05 were available. Urine MA was measured yearly with follow-up testing if abnormal. Prevalence of MA/P was 19.4%. Increasing age and lower hemoglobin levels were related to MA/P but sex was not. Microalbumin excretion normalized in 44% of patients treated with hydroxyurea and 56% of patients treated with ACEI. Hyperkalemia developed in 4 ACEI patients resulting in discontinuation of treatment in 3 children. In summary, MA/P often develops in childhood and preventive and treatment strategies for sickle cell nephropathy should be a focus of pediatric programs. Our preliminary data suggest that although both hydroxyurea and ACEI therapy may be beneficial for MA/P, hyperkalemia may limit the utility of ACEI.", 
    "504": "The proximal tubule (PT) is major site for the reabsorption of filtered HCO(3)(-). Previous work on the rabbit PT showed that 1) increases in basolateral (BL) CO(2) concentration ([CO(2)](BL)) raise the HCO(3)(-) reabsorption rate (J(HCO(3))), and 2) the increase that luminal angiotensin II (ANG II) produces in J(HCO(3)) is greatest at 0% [CO(2)](BL) and falls to nearly zero at 20%. Here, we investigate the role of angiotensin receptors in the [CO(2)](BL) dependence of J(HCO(3)) in isolated perfused PTs. We found that, in rabbit S2 PT segments, luminal 10(-8) M saralasin (peptide antagonist of ANG II receptors), lowers baseline J(HCO(3)) (5% CO(2)) to the value normally seen at 0% in the absence of inhibitors and eliminates the J(HCO(3)) response to changes in [CO(2)](BL). However, basolateral 10(-8) M saralasin has no effect. As with saralasin, luminal 10(-8) M candesartan (AT(1) antagonist) reduces baseline J(HCO(3)) and eliminates the [CO(2)](BL) dependence of J(HCO(3)). Luminal 10(-7) M PD 123319 (AT(2) antagonist) has no effect. Finally, we compared PTs from wild-type and AT(1A)-null mice of the same genetic background. Knocking out AT(1A) modestly lowers baseline J(HCO(3)) and, like luminal saralasin or candesartan in rabbits, eliminates the J(HCO(3)) response to changes in [CO(2)](BL). Our accumulated evidence suggests that ANG II endogenous to the PT binds to the apical AT(1A) receptor and that this interaction is critical for both baseline J(HCO(3)) and its response to changes in [CO(2)](BL). Neither apical AT(2) receptors nor basolateral ANG II receptors are involved in these processes.",

Inhibition of the RAS has beneficial cerebrovascular effects and may reduce the risk of stroke in a manner possibly independent from the alterations of BP. Some clinical trials even suggest that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) exert cerebroprotective effects beyond BP lowering, but the evidence is controversial. Studies on specific protective actions of antihypertensive drugs are generally hampered by the fact that any treatment-related difference in BP may play a dominant role in the prevention of stroke. There are also indications that the protective potency of ARBs might be superior to that of ACE inhibitors, due to their differential activation of angiotensin II type 2 receptors, but the clinical relevance of this mechanism is unclear. Some studies in primary prevention of stroke, acute stroke, and secondary prevention show advantages for ARBs beyond controlling BP alone. In primary prevention, the LIFE randomized trial showed a significant difference in stroke rate in favor of losartan compared with atenolol despite similar reductions in BP. In acute stroke, the role of hypertension and its treatment remains controversial. ACCESS, however, suggested that an ARB is safe in hypertensive acute stroke patients and may offer advantages independent from BP control. In secondary stroke prevention, there are very few antihypertensive trials. These trials show that BP lowering is at least as successful as in primary prevention, but the absolute stroke risk is much higher. An ACE inhibitor was effective compared with placebo in the PROGRESS trial. The MOSES study showed that eprosartan prevented vascular events more effectively than nitrendipine, despite similar BP-lowering effects. Hypertension is not only the most important risk factor for stroke, but is also closely correlated with cognitive decline and dementia. Therefore, prevention of cognitive decline or even improvement of slightly diminished brain function should be an important goal for antihypertensive treatment in the future. Some clinical data suggest advantages for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel antagonists. Currently, however, the existing data are not sufficient for clinical recommendations. Therefore, ongoing trials will further define the exact role of inhibitors of the RAS and are urgently needed in secondary prevention, in acute stroke, and in the prevention of cognitive decline.", 
    "511": "Zofenopril is a specific ACE inhibitor with antihypertensive, remarkable antioxidant, and cardioprotective properties, including the ability to improve endothelial function and protect against ischemia. These beneficial properties of zofenopril are believed to be due primarily to the presence of a sulfhydryl group and the highly lipophilic nature of the agent. As a potent, long-acting ACE inhibitor with tissue selectivity, it is a useful agent for the treatment of a number of cardiovascular diseases. ACE inhibitors block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and are recommended in the management of hypertension with associated risk factors because of their renoprotective and cardioprotective effects. There is a robust body of comparative data supporting zofenopril as an effective and well tolerated ACE inhibitor for treating hypertension. Hypertensive patients frequently require combination therapy to adequately control BP. ACE inhibitors combined with a diuretic make a very effective combination, as a result of the synergistic mechanisms of these two drug classes that allow good efficacy and favorable tolerability at low doses. The combination of zofenopril and hydrochlorothiazide is effective and superior to monotherapy with either agent. Clinical studies have demonstrated that early administration of zofenopril in patients with acute myocardial infarction is effective and well tolerated for reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events in at-risk patients, and it is believed that much of the benefit is a result of the primary cardioprotective effect of zofenopril.",

Meanwhile, the upstream therapy of atrial fibrillation, the management of many components that lead to atrial fibrillation, has been paid much attention to, because its target would be the causes of atrial fibrillation itself. Among many upstream therapies, the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system would be promising from basic and clinical viewpoints, and also from rhythm management and stroke prevention.",

It is the DREAM study which evaluate the therapeutic effects of rosiglitazone and ramipril versus placebo in the prevention of type 2 diabetes in high risk patients: glucose intolerance or impaired fasting glucose. In this clinical study, more than 5000 patients were followed during 3 years. The risk of diabetes was reduced with rosiglitazone of 62% (NNT 9). In the field of negative effects the risk of cardiac insufficiency was multiplied by 7 (NNH 250) but stayed a rare event (to 0,5% of the treated subjects). The ramipril had no preventive effect for the prevention of type 2 diabetes but induced a higher frequency of return towards the normoglycaemia. This treatment can be recommended for these high risk subjects.",

We observed a stepwise augmentation of left ventricular mass index decrease with worsening left ventricular geometry (P<0.001).

Despite the high prevalence of this condition and its associated major morbidity and mortality, diagnosis can be difficult, and optimal treatment remains poorly defined. Identification of the acute triggers for the decompensation as well as noninvasive characterization of cardiac filling pressures and output is central to management. Diuretics, vasodilators, continuous positive airway pressure and inotropes can be used to alleviate symptoms. However, few agents currently available for the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure have been definitively shown in large prospective randomized clinical trials to provide meaningful improvements in intermediate-term clinical outcomes. Multiple novel therapies are being developed, but previous treatment failures indicate that progress in the management of acute decompensated heart failure is likely to be slow.",

Individual immunosuppressive regimens were comparable between those with and those without anaemia. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) administration was not more prevalent in those with anaemia compared with those without (36.2 vs 38.8%, P=0.88). There was a significant inverse correlation between Hb levels and serum EPO levels (R=-0.29, P<0.001), but not between EPO levels and eGFR (R=0.02, P=0.74).

    "523": "Diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common causes of neuropathic pain. The management of DPN consists of excluding other causes of painful peripheral neuropathy, maximising diabetic control and using medications to alleviate pain. The precise relationship between glycaemic control and the development and severity of DPN remains controversial. In this context, drugs such as aldose reductase inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents and alpha-lipoic acid (thioctic acid) may have a useful role to play. There is also evidence that a successful pancreatic transplant may improve symptoms over time, but the mainstay of management continues to be symptomatic control of pain with drugs. Evidence from placebo-controlled studies has shown that opioids, antiepileptic and antidepressant drugs together with capsaicin are effective for alleviating DPN. Tramadol and oxycodone have been shown to be effective in studies of limited duration but their adverse effects, such as constipation and physical dependency, may limit their usefulness as a first-line treatment for DPN. Of the antidepressant drugs, the tricyclic antidepressants have been shown to be effective for alleviating DPN. These medications are widely used but their anticholinergic and sedative properties may not be well tolerated by patients. There is also good evidence that the serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs venlafaxine and duloxetine are effective for treating DPN. However, venlafaxine may cause cardiac dysrhythmias, and patients using this medication require careful cardiac monitoring. Duloxetine appears to be less cardiotoxic and is licensed in the US and EU for alleviating DPN. The gabapentinoid group of drugs, gabapentin and pregabalin, appear to be the most evidence-based of the antiepileptic drugs for treating DPN. Large placebo-controlled studies have been performed with both of these agents. For many patients, it is still unclear what advantages pregabalin has over gabapentin for DPN. Until better evidence emerges, the potential availability of less expensive generic formulations of gabapentin, together with greater experience with its use, favour gabapentin as the main antiepileptic drug for alleviating DPN. Topiramate, lamotrigine, sodium valproate and oxcarbazepine have been shown to be effective in smaller studies but do not have the same evidence base as the gabapentinoid group of drugs. Of the newer antiepileptic drugs, lacosamide appears to be the most promising for alleviating DPN. Capsaicin has the best evidence base of all the topical agents, but local anaesthetic patches may also have a useful therapeutic role. It is not possible to nominate a single drug as the first-line treatment for DPN and there is evidence that a low-dose combination of two or more drugs rather than a single agent may provide better symptomatic relief with fewer adverse effects. Further studies are necessary to clarify the best combination(s) of treatment for DPN.",

Heart rate variability (HRV) is one of the most popular parameters used to assess the autonomic tone. HRV has been reported as a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Currently, three different categories of methods in HRV analysis are being used; the time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis. Both time domain and frequency domain analyses of HRV have been investigated extensively regarding their use as a prognostic marker for cardiovascular mortality. The non-linear dynamic analysis is the latest tool that has shown to have an even higher predictive value than any of the traditional parameters.

We describe a sensitive, quantitative, and high-throughput technique for measuring hepatic collagen synthesis in vivo through metabolic labeling with heavy water ((2)H(2)O). Rats and mice received (2)H(2)O in drinking water for up to 35 days. Deuterium incorporation into collagen-bound amino acids (AA) alanine and hydroxyproline (OHP) was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A threefold stimulation of collagen fractional synthesis was observed under the maximum dosage of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4); 1.67 ml/kg). Deuterium enrichment was systematically 20% higher in AA from monomeric collagen relative to dimeric collagen, consistent with slower turnover of the latter. Administration of 1% griseofulvin to mice resulted in a significant, threefold increase in liver collagen synthesis, observable within 12 days and consistent with predicted interstrain differences (C57/Bl6J > BALB/c). Deuterium enrichments of OHP from total liver proteins correlated well with alanine or OHP from isolated collagen. Fibrogenesis subsided after withdrawal of CCl(4) exposure and was reduced to various degrees by coadministration of interferon-gamma, rosiglitazone, atorvastatin, or enalapril. Changes in isotopically measured collagen synthesis correlated with, but were more sensitive and reproducible than, standard histological staining (trichrome) for fibrosis.

It is believed that treatment with an ARB increases the level of plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) because of a lack of negative feedback on renin activity. However, Ichikawa (Hypertens Res 2001; 24: 641-646) reported that long-term treatment of hypertensive patients with olmesartan resulted in a reduction in plasma Ang II level, though the mechanism was not determined. It has been reported that angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-(1-7)) potentiates the effect of bradykinin and acts as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It is known that ACE2, which was discovered as a novel ACE-related carboxypeptidase in 2000, hydrolyzes Ang I to Ang-(1-9) and also Ang II to Ang-(1-7). It has recently been reported that olmesartan increases plasma Ang-(1-7) through an increase in ACE2 expression in rats with myocardial infarction. We hypothesized that over-expression of ACE2 may be related to a reduction in Ang II level and the cardioprotective effect of olmesartan. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg/day of olmesartan for 4 weeks to 12-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) significantly reduced blood pressure and left ventricular weight compared to those in SHRSP given a vehicle. Co-administration of olmesartan and (D-Ala7)-Ang-(1-7), a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist, partially inhibited the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure and left ventricular weight. Interestingly, co-administration of (D-Ala7)-Ang-(1-7) with olmesartan significantly increased the plasma Ang II level (453.2+/-113.8 pg/ml) compared to olmesartan alone (144.9+/-27.0 pg/ml, p<0.05). Moreover, olmesartan significantly increased the cardiac ACE2 expression level compared to that in Wistar Kyoto rats and SHRSP treated with a vehicle. Olmesartan significantly improved cardiovascular remodeling and cardiac nitrite/ nitrate content, but co-administration of olmesartan and (D-Ala7)-Ang-(1-7) partially reversed this anti-remodeling effect and the increase in nitrite/nitrate. These findings suggest that olmesartan may exhibit an ACE inhibitory action in addition to an Ang II receptor blocking action, prevent an increase in Ang II level, and protect cardiovascular remodeling through an increase in cardiac nitric oxide production and endogenous Ang-(1-7) via over-expression of ACE2.", 
    "568": "Atherosclerosis accounts for most peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD). Although many of the risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) such as hyperlipidemia have been identified as risk factors for peripheral arterial disease, strong evidence is lacking that risk factor modification is effective in halting progression or improving outcomes. A better understanding is needed regarding the clinical and pathophysiologic responses to risk factor modification. This review describes current advances in the medical management for PAD including lipid modification antiplatelet therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, exercise, and endovascular intervention. In addition, we discuss our active ELIMIT Trial (Effect of Lipid Modification on Peripheral Arterial Disease after Endovascular Intervention). We test the hypothesis that an aggressive regimen of serum lipid modification will inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis in femoral arteries and reduce the incidence of restenosis of femoral arteries following endovascular stenting by decreasing thrombosis and inflammation. This study will provide a novel strategy for retarding or preventing progression of atherosclerosis and re-stenosis of peripheral arterial disease following arterial revascularization procedures. Importantly, our magnetic resonance imaging studies will provide quantitative data on the vascular lesions in PAD. These studies will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and thrombosis associated with aggressive lipid modification.", 
    "569": "The objective of this study was to determine whether adrenomedullin, a vasodilator peptide, modulates the process of cell death in cardiomyocytes and whether its effect would be enhanced by the endopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat, which reduces adrenomedullin degradation. Further, we sought to determine whether the effect of adrenomedullin involved an action to preserve mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). Cardiomyocytes in culture were treated with agents that interrupted the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inhibiting glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Cell death was evaluated by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay and DeltaPsi(m) was assessed by fluorescent microscopy. Cytochrome c loss from mitochondria and appearance in cytosol was determined by Western blotting. Potassium cyanide (KCN) plus deoxyglucose or antimycin A, for 24 h, produced significant (p<0.01) concentration-dependent reductions in cell viability or increases in cell death. Adrenomedullin reduced cell death produced in this manner and the effect of adrenomedullin was enhanced by treatment with omapatrilat. In contrast, there was no additional reduction in cell death by lisinopril treatment. Omapatrilat plus adrenomedullin reduced the KCN plus deoxyglucose-induced increase in cytosolic cytochrome c. A likely mechanism centers on the ability of adrenomedullin plus omapatrilat to prevent the decline in mitochondrial DeltaPsi(m) produced by KCN plus deoxyglucose treatment. In summary, adrenomedullin plus omapatrilat limited the decline in mitochondrial DeltaPsi(m) that accompanies interruption of mitochondrial metabolism and limited the extent of cell death in cardiomyocytes treated with KCN plus deoxyglucose or antimycin. Adrenomedullin plus the endopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat may be a useful strategy to protect cardiomyocytes from cell death, in conditions associated with impairment of mitochondrial function.", 
    "570": "A cough is defined as chronic, if it exceeds 8 weeks in length. Post-nasal drip (PND), bronchial asthma and gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD) must be systematically investigated, as these account for 90 percent of chronic cough cases. In addition to medical history and examination which should exclude either a postinfectious cough or coughing related to ACE inhibitor medication, a new evaluation model suggests chest X ray and spirometry as the initial step. A chronic cough is rarely due to one cause as in at least 25% of cases 2 etiologies are present. An effective treatment of chronic cough often relies on several medication trials until its disappearance. After a multidisciplinary approach to chronic cough using this investigative model, the diagnosis of idiopathic or psychogenic cough should remain exceptional.",

Recently, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been shown to promote apoptosis. In addition, pharmacologic ACE inhibition (ACE-I) both prevents apoptosis and reduces TNF-alpha expression in vitro. We hypothesized that ACE-I, using enalaprilat, would decrease colonic epithelial cell apoptosis and reduce colitis severity in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model in mice. We assessed the severity of colitis, and colonic epithelial cell apoptosis, after administration of DSS. Mice were given either daily ACE-I treatment or daily placebo. ACE-I treatment markedly improved clinical outcomes. In addition, ACE-I treatment significantly reduced the maximum histopathologic colitis grade. ACE-I also dramatically reduced the epithelial apoptotic rate. To investigate the mechanism by which ACE-I reduced apoptosis; we measured TNF-alpha, Bcl-2, and Bax expression. TNF-alpha mRNA was significantly lower with ACE-I treatment compared to placebo at every time point, as was the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2.

Iatrogenic nephropathies are manifested by a wide variety of clinical symptoms, including acute renal failure (about 20%), one of the major negative prognostic factors in internal diseases. Occupational kidney disorders induced by exposure to chemical toxins at a work place may coincide with those caused by drugs. This comorbidity can increase the risk of their progression to further deterioration of renal function, leading finally to long lasting work disability among employees. In this paper, we analyzed the mechanism by which major nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, contrast media and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) exert their effect on kidneys. Special attention was paid to over-the-counter medications, which are available in many countries, and thus are frequently abused by the working population.

    "622": "Prevention and regression of diabetic renal disease can be obtained through the combination of strict blood pressure control, which frequently requires the combination of different antihypertensive drugs, with tight glycaemic control. Recent evidence obtained with the angiotensin receptor blockers has allowed the recognition by most guidelines that this class of agents constitutes the first choice to treat hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients presenting with diabetic renal disease at any stage of evolution, from microalbuminuria to advanced renal failure. Of course this must be accompanied by an integral coverture of the increased global cardiovascular risk that always accompanies this situation. This short review contains the most relevant evidence in favour of angiotensin receptor blockers, with particular emphasis on the capacities of candesartan for controlling blood pressure and protecting the kidney. In patients with type 2 diabetes and varying degrees of albuminuria, treatment with candesartan 8-32mg daily was shown to reduce urinary albumin excretion (UAE) by up to 60%. When given in addition to an ACE inhibitor (dual blockade), reductions in UAE of 25-35% relative to ACE inhibitor monotherapy have been found.", 
    "623": "Atherosclerosis is a widespread, chronic progressive disease that mainly involves medium-sized arteries. Clinically, it can become apparent as ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease. In Spain, atherosclerosis is responsible for 124,000 deaths each year. Despite the trend towards a reduction in the aged-adjusted mortality rate for cardiovascular disease, the public health burden is expected to increase. The risk factors are the same for all affected vascular beds, regardless of location, and can be classified as either causal, conditional or predisposing. The presence of atherosclerosis in a particular vascular bed is frequently associated with disease in other vascular territories. Risk assessment tables, inflammatory markers, imaging, and the ankle-brachial index can help in identifying subclinical atherosclerosis. Given the systemic nature of the disease, treatment with statins, antiplatelet agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have consistently proven beneficial, irrespective of the vascular bed affected.",

Long-term mortality was significantly higher in the non-STEMI patients as compared to STEMI patients, 20% vs. 12%, p = 0.006, respectively. However, multivariate analysis showed that age, diabetes, hypertension and no reperfusion therapy (but not non-STEMI presentation) were independent and significant predictors of long-term mortality.", 
    "627": "In an unselected cohort of patients discharged with MI, there were significant differences in baseline characteristics, and (invasive) treatment between STEMI and non-STEMI. Long-term mortality was also different, but this was due to differences in baseline characteristics and treatment. More aggressive treatment may improve outcome in non-STEMI patients.", 
    "628": "Inflammation and cytokine pathways are crucial for the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. In this review, the hypothesis that immunomodulatory drugs provide a possible therapeutic modality for cardiovascular disease is evaluated. Therefore, after a short overview of the specific inflammatory pathways involved in atherosclerosis, literature on the effect of several immunomodulatory drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors and immunosuppressive drugs, used currently in the prevention of rejection after organ transplant, on the development and progression of atherosclerosis is reviewed. In addition, the pleiotropic immunomodulatory effect of two established cardiovascular drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins) is discussed.", 
    "629": "In patients with hypertension and diabetes, atherothrombosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is now compelling evidence demonstrating that lowering elevated blood pressure (BP) is one of the most beneficial aims of therapy in this high-risk population. Indeed, major international guidelines have set a target BP goal of 130/80 mmHg in high-risk patients and recommend combination treatment with two or more drug classes to help achieve this objective. Manidipine plus delapril is a fixed-dose combination of a third-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, which is effective in mild-to-moderately hypertensive patients with an inadequate response to monotherapy. It is also effective in the long-term (50 weeks) management of essential hypertension. Comparative studies have demonstrated that manidipine plus delapril is as effective as enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with hypertension that is unresponsive to monotherapy, and as effective as ramipril plus HCTZ, valsartan plus HCTZ, irbesartan plus HCTZ and olmesartan plus HCTZ in patients with essential hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. In addition, manidipine plus delapril exhibited renoprotective effects in normotensive Type 2 diabetic patients, and improved fibrinolytic function (significantly more than irbesartan plus HCTZ) in hypertensive patients with Type 2 diabetes. Manidipine 10 mg plus delapril 30 mg once daily was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected adverse effects and evidence of a low incidence of ankle edema. Thus, manidipine plus delapril is a fixed-dose combination treatment that significantly reduces elevated BP with once-daily administration. It is well tolerated and has ancillary properties, such as nephroprotective activity and improvement of fibrinolytic balance, which may help reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk patients, such as those with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "630": "Few genetic factors have been identified that determine susceptibility to and progression of IgA-nephropathy (IgAN). Given that IgAN is usually characterized by mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis and that PDGF-B is of central pathophysiological relevance in this process, we analyzed four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PDGF-B gene to evaluate a possible association of these SNPs with disease onset and progression, histological grading and responses to ACE inhibitor (ACEi) therapy.", 
    "631": "The total study population consisted of 195 IgAN patients (127 from southern Italy and 68 from northern Germany) and 200 healthy controls (100 from each region). All four SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and genotype distributions did not differ between patients and controls in either region.", 
    "632": "SNP distribution in Italian patients reaching end-stage renal disease (n=45) also was not significantly different from patients maintaining a serum creatinine below 1.2 mg/dl (n=60) during 5.6 +/- 5.5 years of follow-up. Furthermore, we failed to detect significant effects of any SNP on the slope of 1/serum creatinine, proteinuria level or the antiproteinuric response to ACEi. Additionally, particular PDGF-B genotypes did not correlate with histological grading using the Lee classification.", 
    "633": "We conclude that none of the four PDGF-B SNPs is related to the onset of IgAN in two different populations and that none of them has a major influence on the course of IgAN.", 
    "634": "Individuals with transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke have a high risk of recurrent stroke and death. While acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) is proven and accepted as standard therapy in these patients, recent trials demonstrate that a combination of ASA and dipyridamole (DP) or clopidogrel may be superior to ASA. Blocking the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may also reduce recurrent stroke. The ongoing PRoFESS (Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes) trial is designed to evaluate whether ASA + extended-release DP compared to clopidogrel, and whether telmisartan in addition to usual care in individuals after a stroke, will reduce the risk of further strokes.",

Patients > or = 50 years presenting with an ischemic stroke < 120 days who were stable were randomized. The primary outcome for the trial is recurrent stroke, using a time-to-event analysis. The most important secondary outcome is the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death. Other secondary outcomes include this composite + congestive heart failure, new-onset diabetes, other designated occlusive vascular events (pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusion, transient ischemic attack, cerebral venous thrombosis or retinal vascular accident not classified as stroke), any death, stroke subtype by TOAST criteria and Mini Mental State Examination score. Safety is evaluated by assessing the risk of major hemorrhagic events. The comparison between ASA + DP and clopidogrel is based on an initial assessment of noninferiority, followed by evaluation of superiority, while for telmisartan, we will assess its superiority over placebo.", 
    "636": "With over 20,000 patients randomized, and utilizing a 2 x 2 factorial design, PRoFESS is the largest stroke trial to investigate the prevention of recurrent stroke. The mean age was 66.1 +/- 8.6 years, and 36.0% of the patients were females. The median time from qualifying event to randomization was 15 days with 39.9% of patients randomized within 10 days. According to the TOAST criteria, 28.5% of the strokes were due to large-vessel disease, 52.1% to small-vessel disease, 1.8% to cardioembolism, and 2.0% to other determined etiologies and 15.5% were of undetermined etiology.",

With ramipril, RPF response to L-NMMA increased from 60.1 +/- 12.2 to 87.8 +/- 9.2 ml/min (P = 0.018). The adjusted difference between treatments was -17.1 +/- 13.7 ml/min (P = 0.214). In accordance, telmisartan increased RPF at rest (i.e., without L-NMMA) from 652.0 +/- 27.0 to 696.1 +/- 31.0 ml/min (P = 0.047), whereas ramipril produced no significant changes in RPF. The more the basal NO activity improved, the greater was the vasodilatory effect on renal vasculature (r = 0.47, P < 0.001).",

The later compete with histamine for H(2) receptors and block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. Our studies are focused on the in vitro availability of fosinopril in presence of commonly used H(2) receptor antagonists. Derivative spectroscopy has been employed for the quantitation of fosinopril and H(2) receptor antagonists followed by linear regression analysis. These studies were carried out in buffers of pH 7.4 and 9 at 37, 48 and 60( masculine)C. Stability constant and thermodynamic function had also been calculated in order to evaluate the reaction mechanism. Commonly prescribed H(2) receptor antagonists like cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine were used in these studies. Present study clearly indicated that most of the H(2) receptor antagonists studied decreased the availability of fosinopril which conclude that availability of fosinopril can be affected by the concurrent administration of H(2) receptor antagonists.",

On the other hand, there are only a few reported cases of KS in patients with end stage renal failure receiving hemodialysis. Here, we report a case of HHV-8 positive, disseminated KS, in a 70-year-old man with renal failure, receiving hemodialysis for 7 months. The KS lesions had begun to develop almost at the same time with the onset of dialysis. The patient had been on captopril therapy since the diagnosis of renal failure. Captopril has been reported to inhibit angiogenesis, and by this way, to reduce tumor growth. However, in our patient, the lesions had developed under the treatment of captopril, and showed no evidence of regression after withdrawal of the drug.", 
    "644": "Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that promote the generation and progressive nature of atrial fibrillation. Evidence from both experimental and clinical investigations has implicated an important role for the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inflammation, and oxidative stress, with data that suggest a potential beneficial effect for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, antiinflammatory agents, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, compounds that increase gap junctional conductance or that block 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 receptors have also shown promise in the experimental setting.

In this study, we investigated the effects of a non-depressor dose of imidapril on organ damage induced by diabetes and hypertension. Diabetes was induced by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg) in 15-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Imidapril (2 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was given orally for 28 days, and then the heart weight, left ventricle mass (LVM), urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and endothelial function were examined, as well as the urinary NOx level and local hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression. There were no significant differences between the treated groups in systolic blood pressure and plasma parameters. On the other hand, UAE was significantly suppressed in the imidapril-treated group (450+/-44 mg/day) compared to the vehicle-treated group (963+/-182 mg/day) (p<0.01). Moreover, endothelial function assessed by dilative reaction to acetylcholine as well as cardiac hypertrophy assessed by both heart/body weight ratio and LVM were significantly improved in the imidapril-treated group (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). The urinary NOx concentration and local HGF expression in vessel walls were also significantly increased in the imidapril-treated group (p<0.01). A non-depressor dose of imidapril showed protective effects against organ damage in diabetic SHR, which may be partially due to the increase of HGF and NO.",

However, they poorly applied rational pharmacotherapy principles such as (a) writing a \"good\" prescription which is easily readable by the pharmacist and the patient and that contains full essential information; (b) a medical examination of the patient to assess her/his current clinical condition; and (c) taking care of not prescribing drugs with potential interaction like antihypertensives and NSAIDs together.", 
    "659": "Inhibition of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) produces protective effects on cardio-renal injury in type 2 diabetes. Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI) represent a new pharmacological tool, acting by simultaneous inhibition of the RAAS and neutral endopeptidase. We examined the effects of chronic VPI on renal function and morphology in experimental type 2 diabetes as compared to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-I). Zucker diabetic fatty rats aged 13 weeks were treated with either VPI (AVE7688, ZDF-VPI, n = 8) or ACE-I (Ramipril, ZDF-ACE-I, n = 7) or placebo (ZDF, n = 8). Heterozygous rats served as non-diabetic controls (Ctr, n = 8). Both treatments led to a similar decrease in blood pressure. After 10 weeks of treatment, ZDF developed marked albuminuria. The latter was significantly attenuated in ZDF-VPI as compared to ZDF and ZDF-ACE-I. Renal histology revealed a significant expansion in the glomerular tuft area in all ZDF groups. However, expression of glomerular desmin, which has been recognized as a sensitive marker of early podocyte damage, was significantly increased in ZDF as compared to Ctr. Desmin was reduced in ZDF-VPI but not in animals treated with ACE-I. There was a correlation between albumin excretion and desmin-positive glomerular area. In experimental type 2 diabetes, albuminuria correlates to podocyte damage. These hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy are attenuated by VPI to a greater extent than by ACE-I alone. These findings suggest that podocyte damage is an early critical step in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, and that VPI is a promising pharmacological tool in the treatment of diabetic renal disease.", 
    "660": "ACE-inhibitors are said to cause angioneurotic edema. In spite of the fact that patients with acute angioedema of the head and neck region are usually admitted to an ENT department, there is only limited information available in the otorhinolaryngological literature on the frequency, risk of recurrent episodes and clinical significance of ACE inhibitor related angioedema.",

In 34 patients (=28.1%), edema was related to permanent treatment with ACE inhibitors. The overall frequency of angioedema and the percentage of ACE inhibitor related angioedema showed a continuous increase during the study period. There was a latency from the beginning of ACE inhibitor treatment until the first manifestation of angioedema of up to 13 years. In comparison with the group of edema patients without ACE inhibitor treatment, we found a threefold risk of recurrent edema in the ACE group. Women were affected by recurrent episodes more often than men. Until now, any individual assessment of the probable risk of developing an angioneurotic edema during ACE inhibitor treatment appears to be impossible.",

On the other hand, they modify synthesis and release of PGI(2) and NO via increasing production of other biologically important peptides like bradykinin, Ang-(1-7) or Ang-(1-9). Thus, ACE-Is play a crucial role in the function of endothelium and are effective and important tool for therapy of range of cardiovascular system disorders. Moreover, they are sensitive pharmacological instrument to elucidate and expand our knowledge about the role of RAS in human patophysiology.",

Apoptosis in progenitor CD34+ cells was assessed using the Annexin V-PE/7-AAD detection kit, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed with triple staining for CD34, annexin-V, and 7-AAD. The percentage of apoptotic CD34+ progenitors was determined in the 2 subject groups and correlated with clinical characteristics. The percentage of apoptotic CD34+ progenitor cells was significantly increased in patients with ACS as compared with healthy subjects and was associated with the extent of coronary stenosis by angiography. There was no significant correlation between apoptotic progenitor CD34+ cells and the other parameters that we examined (age, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, ejection fraction, creatinine levels, or taking any of the various medications, including beta blockers, thiazides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium blockers, nitrates, or statins).",

Moreover, diabetes is associated with increased PAD severity. This Review summarizes atherothrombosis and PAD in patients with diabetes, and American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for management of patients with PAD. Patients with PAD and diabetes require optimal limb care and aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction. An LDL cholesterol level of less than 1.8 mmol/l (<70 mg/dl) is the therapeutic goal in these patients, and this target should be pursued using an aggressive statin regimen. Fibrate therapy can also be indicated. beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events in high-risk patient populations, and these agents are recommended for use in patients with both diabetes and PAD. Blood pressure of less than 130/80 mmHg should be achieved, and glycated hemoglobin should be reduced to below 7%. Patients should also receive indefinite antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel. For patients with claudication, a supervised exercise program and cilostazol therapy to improve PAD symptoms and walking distance form the main noninvasive components of therapy. Revascularization can also be indicated in carefully selected patients with claudication. For patients with critical limb ischemia, diagnostic testing by a vascular specialist will determine whether revascularization or amputation is feasible.",

    "670": "Beta-adrenoblockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antithrombotic drugs were the most drug used (76%, 74%, and 76%, respectively) in patients following myocardial infarction. Most of the patients used a three-drug combination (36.8%), more rarely--two-drug (24.1%) or four-drug complex (19.8%). One drug was used only in 12.1% of cases; 7.2% of patients did not use any cardiac drugs. Beta-adrenoblocker with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was the most common (40.3%) used drug combination in patients on two drug complex. The combination of beta-adrenoblocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and antithrombotics was more frequently used in patients on three drug complex. The combination of two or three cardiac drugs with statin was used in several cases (1.6-10.3%).", 
    "671": "These findings underscore that the use of beta-adrenoblockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antithrombotics was high (about 75%) in patients during the first year after myocardial infarction, and the combination of these three drugs was used more commonly. The discordance between existing guidelines for statin use after myocardial infarction and current practice was determined in patients following myocardial infarction.", 
    "672": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enhances the liver regeneration in rats after partial hepatectomy (PH), though the precise mechanisms are unknown. To determine the roles of bradykinin and angiotensin II in the ACE inhibitor-induced enhancement of liver regeneration, we investigated effects of lisinopril (ACE inhibitor), candesartan and losartan (angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists) and icatibant (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist) on the hepatic regenerative response to 70% PH in the rat. The liver regeneration was evaluated by measuring the frequency of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into hepatocyte nuclei 48 h after PH. We found that administration of candesartan or losartan, as well as lisinopril, enhanced BrdU incorporation after PH, and the lisinopril-induced enhancement was inhibited in part (40%) by icatibant. PH induced the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA in remnant liver, and this PH-induced up-regulation of HGF mRNA was further enhanced not only by lisinopril but also by candesartan and losartan. Administration of icatibant inhibited up to 40% of the lisinopril-induced up-regulation of HGF mRNA. These results suggest that the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by either ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor antagonist enhances the hepatic regenerative response to PH, probably through an augmentation of hepatic HGF production. In addition to this mechanism, the activation of B2 receptors may also be involved in the ACE inhibitor-induced enhancement of hepatic regenerative response.", 
    "673": "Premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in subjects with type 1 diabetes dramatically affects quality of life and morbidity and leads to premature death, but there is still little known about the mechanisms and predictors of this complication. In the present study, we explored the role of genetic variants of angiotensinogen (AGT, M235T), ACE (I/D), and angiotensin type 1 receptor (ATR1, A1166C) as predictors of rapid progression of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Five-hundred eighty-five type 1 diabetic patients and 592 similar age and sex control subjects were evaluated for progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical CAD, before and after a 2.5-year follow-up. In logistic regression analysis, CAC progression was dramatically more likely in type 1 diabetic subjects not treated with ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker who had the TT-ID-AA/AC genotype combination than in those with other genotypes (odds ratio 11.6 [95%CI 4.5-29.6], P < 0.0001) and was even stronger when adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors and the mean A1C (37.5 [3.6-388], P = 0.002). In conclusion, a combination of genotype variants of the renin-angiotensin system genes is a powerful determinant of subclinical progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetic patients and may partially explain accelerated CAD in type 1 diabetes.", 
    "674": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme in cardiovascular pathophysiology, consists of two homologous domains (N- and C-), each bearing a Zn-dependent active site. ACE inhibitors are among the most prescribed drugs in the treatment of hypertension and cardiac failure. Fine epitope mapping of two monoclonal antibodies (mAb), 1G12 and 6A12, against the N-domain of human ACE, was developed using the N-domain 3D-structure and 21 single and double N-domain mutants. The binding of both mAbs to their epitopes on the N-domain of ACE is significantly diminished by the presence of the C-domain in the two-domain somatic tissue ACE and further diminished by the presence of sialic acid residues on the surface of blood ACE. The binding of these mAbs to blood ACE, however, increased dramatically (5-10-fold) in the presence of ACE inhibitors or EDTA, whereas the effect of these compounds on the binding of the mAbs to somatic tissue ACE was less pronounced and even less for truncated N-domain. This implies that the binding of ACE inhibitors or removal of Zn2+ from ACE active centers causes conformational adjustments in the mutual arrangement of N- and C-domains in the two-domain ACE molecule. As a result, the regions of the epitopes for mAb 1G12 and 6A12 on the N-domain, shielded in somatic ACE by the C-domain globule and additionally shielded in blood ACE by sialic acid residues in the oligosaccharide chains localized on Asn289 and Asn416, become unmasked. Therefore, we demonstrated a possibility to employ these mAbs (1G12 or 6A12) for detection and quantification of the presence of ACE inhibitors in human blood. This method should find wide application in monitoring clinical trials with ACE inhibitors as well as in the development of the approach for personalized medicine by these effective drugs.", 
    "675": "Nebivolol is a novel beta1-blocker with a greater degree of selectivity for beta1-adrenergic receptors than other agents in this class and a nitric oxide (NO)-potentiating, vasodilatory effect that is unique among beta-blockers currently available to clinicians (nebivolol is approved in Europe and is currently under review in the US). A NO-potentiating agent such as nebivolol may have an important role in hypertensive populations with reduced endothelial function such as diabetics, African-Americans and those with vascular disease. Nebivolol is a racemic mixture with beta-blocker activity residing in the d-isomer; in contrast, l-nebivolol is far more potent in facilitating NO release. Nebivolol is unique among beta-blockers in that, at doses < 10 mg, it does not inhibit the increase in heart rate normally seen with exercise. The efficacy ofnebivolol has been tested successfully in clinical trials against other agents including other beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors and calcium channel antagonists in patients with hypertension, angina, and congestive heart failure. The tolerability of nebivolol has been shown to be superior to that of atenolol and metoprolol. In controlled clinical trials, nebivolol has a side effect profile that is similar to placebo, in particular as it relates to fatigue and sexual dysfunction. This article will review published clinical data regarding this cardioselective beta-blocker.", 
    "676": "Hypertension is one of the most important contributors to atherosclerosis. A possible link between inflammation and elevated blood pressure has been suggested by several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Possible mechanisms include an imbalance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators, amplified thrombogenesis and platelet activation, and perhaps a direct effect of inflammatory mediators. C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory cytokine, may play an essential role in vascular inflammation and can directly decrease the production of nitric oxide, a vasocodilator. Angiotensin II (Ang II) up-regulates several inflammatory cytokines, leukocyte adhesion molecules, and chemokines through the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B leading to a decrease in the bioavailability of vasodilators. The increase in oxidative stress and endothelin-1 production through Ang II may further contribute to vasoconstriction. Adipose tissue can add to the production of CRP and creates a prothrombotic state. The presence of low-grade inflammation, especially elevations of CRP, can help predict the risk of future cardiovascular events and is associated with target organ damage in hypertensive individuals. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, and, to a lesser degree calcium channel antagonists, have shown efficacy in reducing CRP. Lifestyle changes such as exercise, weight loss, and tobacco cessation have also shown a similar efficacy. Whether targeting inflammation in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension can alter the natural history of the disease or lead to improved outcome has yet to be determined.",

ACEI and Epl reduced NADPH oxidase showing an additive effect in their combination; ACEI increased manganese SOD (MnSOD) and Epl increased MnSOD, copper-zinc SOD and catalase, resulting in the lowest levels of oxidative stress with the combination therapy. Glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria were increased in the DSHF rats, and Epl suppressed them more effectively than ACEI to levels not different from the combination of both, showing a positive correlation with NADPH oxidase expression and TGF-beta. Renal TGF-beta was specifically suppressed with Epl",

The present study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enalapril and an NO-releasing enalapril molecule (NCX899) in conscious male beagles. The effects of both enalapril and NCX899 in the arterial hypertension and bradycardia induced by acute NO inhibition in anaesthetized dogs were also investigated. 2. Dogs received either NCX899 (4 micromol/kg, i.v.) or enalapril (4 micromol/kg, i.v.), after which plasma concentrations of the analytes and metabolites were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 3. In the NCX899 group, the area under the time-course curve (AUC(0-24h)) was 29.18 +/- 4.72, 229.37 +/- 51.32 and 5159.23 +/- 514.88 microg.h/L for the analytes nitro-enalapril, enalapril and enalaprilat, respectively. In the enalapril group, the AUC(0-24h) was 704.53 +/- 158.86 and 4149.27 +/- 847.30 microg.h/L for the analytes enalapril and enalaprilat, respectively. Statistical analysis of data from both groups showed a significant difference for the analyte enalapril, but not for enalaprilat. Moreover, NCX899 and enalapril were equally effective in inhibiting the activity of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. 4. In anaesthetized dogs, i.v. administration of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME; 0.1-10 mg/kg) significantly elevated arterial blood pressure, with concomitant bradycardia. The compound NCX899 significantly attenuated both arterial hypertension and bradycardia, whereas enalapril had no significant effect. 5. In conclusion, the present results showed that the NO-releasing derivative of enalapril NCX899 presents a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship similar to its parent compound enalapril. Moreover, NCX899 (but not enalapril) was effective in protecting against the cardiovascular changes induced by acute NOS inhibition.",

Blood pressure (BP) was measured every 4 weeks (JNC 6th report). In patients with inadequate BP control, doxazosin was added and up-titrated. At baseline and after 6 months of treatment, cognitive function was evaluated using the Spanish validated version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Trail Making Test (TMT).",

    "701": "In most patients with hypertension, especially Stage 2 hypertension, adequate control of blood pressure (BP) is only achieved with combination drug therapy. When using combination therapy, antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are recommended, for example, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a beta-blocker + HCTZ, an ACE inhibitor + HCTZ, or a calcium channel blocker + an ACE inhibitor. One such combination is olmesartan medoxomil + HCTZ, which is available as fixed-dose, single-tablet combinations for once-daily administration. In clinical trials, olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ reduced systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) to a greater extent than either component as monotherapy. A clinical study in patients with Stage 1 or 2 hypertension showed that olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ achieved a similar mean reduction in DBP, but a significantly greater mean reduction in SBP and higher rate of BP control (< 140/90 mmHg) than observed with losartan/HCTZ, at US/European-approved starting doses. In a non-inferiority trial, the antihypertensive efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ was comparable to that of atenolol/HCTZ. Furthermore, indirect comparisons have shown that olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ compares favorably with other antihypertensive combination therapies, including other ARB/HCTZ combinations and amlodipine besylate/ benazepril. Olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ is generally well tolerated. In conclusion, olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ is an effective and well-tolerated combination antihypertensive therapy that results in significant BP reductions and BP control in many patients.", 
    "702": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors effectively interfere with the renin-angiotensin system and exert various beneficial actions on vascular structure and function beyond their blood pressure-lowering effects. Zofenopril, a potent sulphydryl ACE inhibitor, is characterized by high lipophilicity, sustained cardiac ACE inhibition, and antioxidant and tissue protective activities. Its ancillary properties, such as antioxidant activity and cardiovascular (CV) protection, make this drug potentially suitable for the treatment and prevention of certain CV diseases. The Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long term Evaluation trials have demonstrated that the early administration of zofenopril to patients with acute myocardial infarction is associated with a significant reduction in the 6-week occurrence of major CV events in high-risk patients with anterior non-thrombolyzed myocardial infarction. The fixed combination of zofenopril-hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 30/12.5 mg/day is approved for the management of mild-to-moderate hypertension in different European countries. In clinical trials comparing zofenopril-HCTZ with each agent administered as monotherapy, combination therapy was clearly more effective in normalizing blood pressure (BP). In addition, combination therapy provided sustained and consistent BP control over the entire 24 hour dosing interval. The efficacy and safety profile of zofenopril-HCTZ highlights that this combination is a potentially useful addition to currently available therapy for patients with BP inadequately controlled by monotherapy, as well as for patients who require more rapid and intensive BP control.", 
    "703": "Olmesartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. In pooled analyses of seven randomized, double-blind trials, 8 weeks' treatment with olmesartan medoxomil was significantly more effective than placebo in terms of the response rate, proportion of patients achieving target blood pressure (BP) and mean change from baseline in diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Olmesartan medoxomil had a fast onset of action, with significant between-group differences evident from 2 weeks onwards. The drug was well tolerated with a similar adverse event profile to placebo. In patients with type 2 diabetes, olmesartan medoxomil reduced renal vascular resistance, increased renal perfusion, and reduced oxidative stress. In several large, randomized, double-blind trials, olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg has been shown to be significantly more effective, in terms of primary endpoints, than recommended doses of losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, or candesartan cilexetil, and to provide better 24 h BP protection. Olmesartan medoxomil was at least as effective as amlodipine, felodipine and atenolol, and significantly more effective than captopril. The efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil in reducing cardiovascular risk beyond BP reduction is currently being investigated in trials involving patients at high risk due to atherosclerosis or type 2 diabetes.",

Previously, we and others have reported that ACE degrades in vitro the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), a putative upstream initiator of Alzheimer disease. These studies support the hypothesis that deficiency in ACE-mediated Abeta proteolysis could increase Alzheimer disease risk and raise the question of whether ACE inhibitors, a commonly prescribed class of anti-hypertensive medications, can elevate Abeta levels in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we administered the ACE inhibitor captopril to two lines of APP transgenic mice harboring either low levels of Abeta or high levels of Abeta with associated plaque deposition. In both models, we show that captopril does not affect cerebral Abeta levels in either soluble or insoluble pools. Furthermore, we find no change in plaque deposition or in peripheral Abeta levels. Data from these Alzheimer models suggest that captopril and similar ACE inhibitors do not cause Abeta accumulation in vivo.", 
    "707": "Retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus, and is an important cause of blindness worldwide. Clinical trials have demonstrated that tight metabolic control inhibits the progression of retinopathy. Good blood pressure control has been shown to be protective in type 2 diabetes, and it may also reduce proliferative retinopathy in type 1 diabetes. However, such control is often difficult to achieve in clinical practice, and may be associated with problems such as hypoglycaemia. New therapies are therefore needed to reduce the risk of retinopathy. There is growing evidence that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, and this has led to interest in RAS inhibitors as agents to prevent retinopathy. Several trials have suggested that ACE inhibitor therapy can inhibit progression of retinopathy. The Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) Programme is currently investigating the effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan on the incidence of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes and its progression in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is hoped that the results from such large-scale clinical trials will provide more specific information about the medical treatment of diabetic retinopathy.", 
    "708": "Type 2 diabetes often occurs in association with hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and markedly increases cardiovascular risk. Strategies to reduce the incidence of diabetes in patients with cardiovascular disease or at high risk for such disease are therefore important. Certain classes of antihypertensive agents, namely the thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, have an adverse impact on the metabolic profile and increase the risk for new-onset diabetes in hypertensive subjects. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which are blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), have been shown to increase insulin sensitivity. They may also reduce the risk of diabetes in patients with hypertension or cardiovascular disorders. Some of the evidence in favour of ACE inhibitors and ARBs has come from studies with active comparators that have potential adverse metabolic effects. However, the Candesartan in Heart failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) programme demonstrated that the ARB candesartan reduced the incidence of diabetes in heart failure patients in comparison to placebo. The mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of RAS blockade remain to be established. Nevertheless, a treatment that can control hypertension and reduce the risk of onset of type 2 diabetes at the same time is certainly desirable.", 
    "709": "An assay using fluorescence resonance energy transfer peptides was developed to assess angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity directly on the membrane of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) stably expressing the full-length somatic form of the enzyme. The advantage of the new method is the possibility of using selective substrates for the two active sites of the enzyme, namely Abz-FRK(Dnp)P-OH for somatic ACE, Abz-SDK(Dnp)P-OH for the N domain, and Abz-LFK(Dnp)-OH for the C domain. Hydrolysis of a peptide bond between the donor/acceptor pair (Abz/Dnp) generates detectable fluorescence, allowing quantitative measurement of the enzymatic activity. The kinetic parameter K(m) for the hydrolysis of the three substrates by ACE in this system was also determined and the values are comparable to those obtained using the purified enzyme in solution. The specificity of the activity was demonstrated by the complete inhibition of the hydrolysis by the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. Therefore, the results presented in this work show for the first time that determination of ACE activity directly on the surface of intact CHO cells is feasible and that the method is reliable and sensitive. In conclusion, we describe a methodology that may represent a new tool for the assessment of ACE activity which will open the possibility to study protein interactions in cells in culture.", 
    "710": "About 5 million Americans suffer from heart failure. Given the correlation of heart failure with age and the rising life expectancy, the prevalence of heart failure continues to increase in the general population. Sympathetic stimulation intensifies with progressive heart failure. The rationale to use beta-blockers in individuals with impaired myocardial function is based on experimental evidence supporting the notion that prolonged alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation leads to worsening heart failure. Until recently, safety concerns have precluded the use of beta-blockers in patients with diabetes and heart failure. However, several large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials such as Metoprolol Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) have shown that beta-blockers can be safely used in patients with diabetes and heart failure. Moreover, beta-blockers significantly improved morbidity and mortality in this population. Based on this evidence, it is now recommended to add beta-blockers such as metoprolol CR/XL with an escalating dosage regimen to the treatment of patients with symptomatic heart failure who already are receiving a stable medical regimen including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, vasodilators, or digitalis.",

This is due to infarct-related complications such as heart failure, cardiac remodeling with progressive ventricular dilation, dysfunction, and hypertrophy, and arrhythmias including ventricular and atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin (Ang) II, the major effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a major contributor to these complications. RAAS inhibition, with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were first shown to reduce mortality and morbidity after MI. Subsequently, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), that produce more complete blockade of the effects of Ang II at the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor, were introduced and the ARB valsartan was shown to be as effective as an ACE inhibitor in reducing mortality and morbidity in high-risk post-MI survivors with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and and/or heart failure and in heart failure patients, respectively, in two major trials (VALIANT and Val-HeFT). Both these trials used an ACE inhibitor as comparator on top of background therapy. Evidence favoring the use of valsartan for secondary prevention in post-MI survivors is reviewed.",

In Switzerland, a population based study in the city of Lausanne (CoLaus) has shown that about 30% of the participants have abnormal glucose homeostasis, and that the prevalence of obesity in the younger age groups has doubled since 1992. In this review, we describe clinical and biological factors associated with an increased risk to develop diabetes and summarize the most important intervention studies that have shown a beneficial effect in the prevention of diabetes.

    "718": "Endothelial dysfunction is a well established response to cardiovascular risk factors and precedes the development of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction is involved in lesion formation by the promotion of both the early and late mechanisms of atherosclerosis including up-regulation of adhesion molecules, increased chemokine secretion and leukocyte adherence, increased cell permeability, enhanced low-density lipoprotein oxidation, platelet activation, cytokine elaboration, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. Endothelial dysfunction is a term that covers diminished production/availability of nitric oxide and/or an imbalance in the relative contribution of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors. Also, when cardiovascular risk factors are treated the endothelial dysfunction is reversed and it is an independent predictor of cardiac events. We review the literature concerning endothelial dysfunction in regard to its pathogenesis, treatment, and outcome.", 
    "719": "Experimental and clinical evidence is now available that antagonism of angiotensin II (Ang II) with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists (AIIAs) is effective in slowing the rate of renal functional loss in patients affected by proteinuric kidney diseases. Among AIIAs, telmisartan has been shown to be characterised by a potent and long lasting antihypertensive effect that may be associated with another specific effect of this molecule, the partial agonism of the peroxisome-activated receptor-gamma. Although this action has also been observed with other AIIAs, telmisartan seems to exert a more effective and specific action as in such a way to influence beneficially adipocyte metabolism, diabetes onset and insulin resistance. Recently, we have demonstrated, at the experimental and clinical level, that sustained blockade of Ang II biological activity with this class of compounds can potentially reduce the progression of renal dysfunction and in some circumstances induce the regression of renal functional and structural changes. In this review we analyse available experimental and clinical data that suggest that blocking Ang II with telmisartan may effectively ameliorate renal dysfunction in patients affected by the now frequently observed condition termed metabolic syndrome.", 
    "720": "We hypothesized that lung inflammation and parenchymal apoptosis in ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) are related to ANG II and assessed the ability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril to attenuate VILI in rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive two ventilation strategies for 2 h: 1) tidal volume of 40 ml/kg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min, and inspiratory O2 fraction of 0.21 [high-volume, 0 positive end-expiratory pressure (HVZP) group] and 2) injection of captopril (100 mg/kg ip) 30 min before HVZP ventilation (HVZP+CAP group). Another group, which did not receive ventilation, served as the control. Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the HVZP+CAP group than in the HVZP group at 2 h of ventilation. Total protein levels were significantly higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) recovered from HVZP-ventilated rats than from controls. BALF macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and lung ANG II were significantly higher in the HVZP group than in the control and HVZP+CAP groups. Lung ANG II levels correlated positively with BALF protein and macrophage inflammatory protein-2. The number of apoptotic airway and alveolar wall cells was significantly higher in the HVZP and HVZP+CAP groups than in the control group and significantly lower in the HVZP+CAP group than in the HVZP group. These results suggest that the efficiency of captopril to attenuate VILI is related to reduction of inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of apoptosis and indicate that VILI is partly mediated by the local angiotensin system.", 
    "721": "In this paper the data on the duplicate use of ACE inhibitors among a community-dwelling elderly population are presented. Using a questionnaire, 1000 subjects were interviewed concerning the use of drugs, 654 females, mean+/-SD age: 72.6+/-6.5 years. They were divided into two groups: Group A (5%) taking at least two ACE inhibitors (n=50) and Group B: those who used either a single ACE inhibitor or no ACE inhibitor (n=950). In Group A, 49 individuals were taking two different ACE inhibitors concomitantly and one was using three. The most commonly used ACE inhibitor was enalapril (29 of 50 subjects). Subjects in Group A consumed significantly more drugs, both of prescription (Rx) and nonprescription (OTC), compared to those in Group B (total means: 8.4+/-2.8 vs. 6.7+/-3.2; p<0.01, Rx means: 6.3+/-2.5 vs. 5.2+/-2.8, p<0.05, OTC means: 2.0+/-1.6 vs. 1.6+/-1.5, p<0.05). Also, they were more likely to have consulted a cardiologist (17/50 vs. 201/950, p<0.05).

The IC(50) values for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of 48 hydrolysates were rapidly determined by capillary electrophoresis (CE). The values ranged from 0.17 to 501.7mg/ml, and were affected by both the marine protein resources and the selected proteases. Hydrolysates of the lowest IC(50) values were from shrimp (Acetes chinensis), shark meat, mackerel bone, Polysiphonia urceolata and Spirulina platensis, indicating these five kinds of marine food proteins contained beneficial materials for the production of ACE inhibitory peptides by proteolysis. The hydrolysates obtained using proteases Protamex and SM98011 had lower IC(50) values, showing these two proteases were superior to others. The CE method achieved the same sensitivity as the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. However, the CE method was faster and, as a result, more economical. Therefore, CE had potential for rapid screening of marine protein hydrolysates enriched in ACE inhibitory peptides.",

One gender-specific therapeutic issue of particular interest to practitioners and the lay public is the role of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Prior to completion of the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study and the Women's Health Initiative Hormone Trials, postmenopausal hormone therapy was believed to exert antiatherosclerotic effects and to thereby reduce coronary heart disease risk in women on the basis of case-control and cohort studies. This review particularly focuses on the role, if any, of postmenopausal hormone therapy for prevention or treatment of PAD, which was a pre-specified secondary outcome for these three randomized trials.",

Pharmacological work has demonstrated that this effect is probably produced by a diuretic activity and inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Two clinical trials have confirmed the antihypertensive effect using watery infusions, in which a natriuretic effect was also detected. To compare therapeutic effectiveness, tolerability, and safety, as well as the effect on serum electrolytes and the ACE inhibitory effect of a herbal medicinal product prepared from the dried extract of H. sabdariffa calyxes (HsHMP) with those of lisinopril on patients with hypertension (HT), a randomized, controlled, and double-blind clinical trial was conducted. Patients of either sex, 25 - 61 years of age, with hypertension stage I or II, were daily treated for 4 weeks with the HsHMP, 250 mg of total anthocyanins per dose (experimental group), or 10 mg of lisinopril (control group). Outcome variables included effectiveness (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] reduction, >or= 10 mmHg), safety (absence of pathological modifications in the biochemical tests of hepatic and renal function), tolerability (absence of intense side effects), effect on serum electrolytes, and effect on ACE activity. Basal analysis included 193 subjects (100 in the experimental group), while outcome variable analysis integrated 171. Results showed that the experimental treatment decreased blood pressure (BP) from 146.48/97.77 to 129.89/85.96 mmHg, reaching an absolute reduction of 17.14/11.97 mmHg (11.58/12.21%, p < 0.05). The experimental treatment showed therapeutic effectiveness of 65.12 % as well as tolerability and safety of 100 %. BP reductions and therapeutic effectiveness were lower than those obtained with lisinopril (p < 0.05). Under the experimental treatment, the serum chlorine level increased from 91.71 to 95.13 mmol/L (p = 0.0001), the sodium level showed a tendency to decrease (from 139.09 to 137.35, p = 0.07), while potassium level was not modified. ACE plasmatic activity was inhibited by HsHMP from 44.049 to 30.1 Units (Us; p = 0.0001). In conclusion, the HsHMP exerted important antihypertensive effectiveness with a wide margin of tolerability and safety, while it also significantly reduced plasma ACE activity and demonstrated a tendency to reduce serum sodium (Na) concentrations without modifying potassium (K) levels. Further studies are necessary for evaluating the dose-dependency of HsHMP and for detecting lower effective doses.",

Material. Patients (n=135) with symptomatic CHF and ischemic (68%) or nonischemic cardiomyopathy (32%) with systolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and sinus rhythm (age 52+/-11.9 years; 42, 40 and 18% with NYHA class II, III and IV, respectively; mean LV ejection fraction 30.1+/-6.7%) At study entry 89 and 78% of patients received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and b-adrenoblockers, respectively. Methods. Holter ECG monitoring with HRV temporal and spectral analysis. Results. During average follow-up of 2.4 years 60 patients (44.4%) died of cardiac causes (92.3% of all deaths). Other deaths were due to surgical pathology (n=1) and stroke (n=2). All standard HRV values with the exception of high frequency power were lowered, this lowering correlated with functional severity of heart failure. According to multifactorial analysis the following characteristics were independent predictors of all cause death: NYHA class III-IV (RR=1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.1-9.6, p=0.002), and SDNN value 90 ms (RR=1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2-2.5, p=0.001). Conclusion. In CHF parameters of HRV are lowered compared to normal values and correlate with functional heart failure severity.

Fifty-five patients with essential hypertension, 11-19 years old, were prospectively studied. All patients received concomitant therapy of hydrochlorothiazide and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Five patients also required angiotensin receptor blocker to achieve the blood pressure goal. Baseline and 12-month follow-up measures of left ventricular mass index (LVMI), determined by echocardiography and urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio (MA/Cr), were collected. MA was defined as MA/Cr >30 microg/mg. LVH was defined as LVMI >38.6 g/m(2.7). The primary end points were reductions in MA and LVMI of 25% or more.

    "750": "After injury, the heart undergoes a remodeling process consisting primarily of myocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis. Although initially beneficial, excess fibrosis gradually results in alteration of left ventricular properties and cardiac dysfunction. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta(1)) is thought to be a primary mediator of fibrosis within the heart after injury. Currently, angiotensin II blockade is used to inhibit the actions of TGF-beta(1). However, recent studies indicate that angiotensin II blockade alone may not be sufficient to prevent TGF-beta(1)-induced fibrosis. Thus far, both in vivo and in vitro models have shown that direct TGF-beta(1) inhibition, NAPDH oxidase inhibitors, growth factors and hormonal treatment regimens targeting TGF-beta(1) may significantly reduce cardiac fibrosis after injury. This study attempts to underline these alternatives to angiotensin II blockade in combating TGF-beta(1)-induced cardiac dysfunction.", 
    "751": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent the front-line pharmacological treatment of heart failure, which is characterized by left ventricular (LV) dilatation and inappropriate hypertrophy. The mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors is still unclear, but evidence suggests that they may act by influencing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. This study sought to determine whether ACE inhibitors can directly regulate MMP activity and whether this results in positive structural and functional adaptations to the heart. To this end, MMP-2 activity in LV tissue extracted from rats with an aortocaval (AV) fistula was assessed by in vitro incubation as well as in vivo treatment with captopril, lisinopril, or quinapril. Furthermore, LV size and function were determined in untreated AV fistula rats, AV fistula rats treated with lisinopril (3, 5, and 8 wk), and age-matched sham-operated controls. In vitro incubation with captopril, lisinopril, or quinapril significantly reduced MMP-2 activity, as did in vivo treatment. This occurred without a reduction in the available pool of MMP-2 protein. Long-term in vivo administration of lisinopril also prevented LV dilatation, attenuated myocardial hypertrophy, and prevented changes in myocardial compliance and contractility. The results herein demonstrate that ACE inhibitors prevent MMP-2 activity and, in so doing, represent a mechanism responsible for preventing the negative structural and functional changes that occur in the rat AV fistula model of heart failure.", 
    "752": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) converts angiotensin II (ANG II) to angiotensin-(1-7) [ANG-(1-7)], and this enzyme may serve as a key regulatory juncture in various tissues. Although the heart expresses ACE2, the extent that the enzyme participates in the cardiac processing of ANG II and ANG-(1-7) is equivocal. Therefore, we utilized the Langendorff preparation to characterize the ACE2 pathway in isolated hearts from male normotensive Sprague-Dawley [Tg((-))] and hypertensive [mRen2]27 [Tg((+))] rats. During a 60-min recirculation period with 10 nM ANG II, the presence of ANG-(1-7) was assessed in the cardiac effluent. ANG-(1-7) generation from ANG II was similar in both the normal and hypertensive hearts [Tg((-)): 510 +/- 55 pM, n=20 vs. Tg((+)): 497 +/- 63 pM, n=14] with peak levels occurring at 30 min after administration of the peptide. ACE2 inhibition (MLN-4760, 1 microM) significantly reduced ANG-(1-7) production by 83% (57 +/- 19 pM, P<0.01, n=7) in the Tg((+)) rats, whereas the inhibitor had no significant effect in the Tg((-)) rats (285 +/- 53 pM, P>0.05, n=10). ACE2 activity was found in the effluent of perfused Tg((-)) and Tg((+)) hearts, and it was highly associated with ACE2 protein expression (r=0.78). This study is the first demonstration for a direct role of ACE2 in the metabolism of cardiac ANG II in the hypertrophic heart of hypertensive rats. We conclude that predominant expression of cardiac ACE2 activity in the Tg((+)) may be a compensatory response to the extensive cardiac remodeling in this strain.", 
    "753": "Vascular inflammation and enhanced production of angiotensin II (ANG II) are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension and diabetes, disease states that predispose the afflicted individuals to ischemic disorders. In light of these observations, we postulated that ANG II may play a role in promoting leukocyte rolling (LR) and adhesion (LA) in postcapillary venules after exposure of the small intestine to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Using an intravital microscopic approach in C57BL/6J mice, we showed that ANG II type I (AT(1)) or type II (AT(2)) receptor antagonism (with valsartan or PD-123319, respectively), inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with captopril, or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor blockade (CGRP8-37) prevented postischemic LR but did not influence I/R-induced LA. However, both postischemic LR and LA were largely abolished by concomitant AT(1) and AT(2) receptor blockade or chymase inhibition (with Y-40079). Additionally, exogenously administered ANG II increased LR and LA, effects that were attenuated by pretreatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist or an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin). Our work suggests that ANG II, formed by the enzymatic activity of ACE and chymase, plays an important role in inducing postischemic LR and LA, effects that involve the engagement of both AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and may be mediated by CGRP and NADPH oxidase.",

Initial assumptions were that these two drug types might be interchangeable, but ongoing research has revealed differences between them in terms of pharmacology and outcomes in clinical trials. Although both groups of drugs lower blood pressure, studies of the ACE inhibitor perindopril have revealed preservation of beneficial vascular and endothelial effects mediated by bradykinin and nitric oxide. The selective blockade exerted by ARBs is not associated with these effects. Furthermore, examination of clinical endpoints in major clinical trials has provoked discussion about outcomes comparing ACE inhibitors and ARBs, with recent debate focusing on the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients receiving these agents.

Although the evidence is strong in vitro, specific actions not shared by other angiotensin receptor blockers have not yet been convincingly demonstrated in vivo or in clinical trials.

Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and control animals were assigned at random to receive the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, the ACEI fosenopril sodium, or vehicle for 24 weeks. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to assess VEGF protein and mRNA expression. Computer-assisted morphometric measurements of transmission electron microscopy photographs were performed to evaluate BMT. Vitreous fluid and retinal VEGF protein and retinal VEGF mRNA expression were significantly higher in diabetic rats than in control rats, with a significant reduction in fosenopril sodium-treated diabetic rats (p<0.01). There was no significant difference in VEGF levels in diabetic rats and propranolol-treated diabetic rats (p>0.05), but there was a significant difference in VEGF protein and mRNA expression in propranolol-treated diabetic rats and fosenopril sodium-treated diabetic rats (p<0.01) without any significant difference in systolic blood pressure in the latter two groups (p>0.05). There was a significant correlation between the level of retinal VEGF expression and changes in retinal BMT (p<0.01).

A total of 57 HT with stage 1 and 2 essential hypertension were included. After 4 weeks run in, a randomized double-blind, three arms, double dummy, independent trial was used. All HT patients were randomly allocated to three treatment arms consisting of losartan (50 mg/daily), ramipril (5 mg/ daily) and combined (losartan 50 mg/daily + ramipril 5 mg/daily) for 24 weeks. TGFbeta1, PIP and PIIIP, LVM, LVM/h(2.7) and other echocardiographic measurements, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and clearance and potassium were determined after run in and after 24 weeks. All groups were comparable for gender, age, body mass index, blood pressure and LVM. The prevalence of baseline left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was not significantly different among three groups. At the end of treatment, a significant (P<0.05) reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), TGFbeta1, PIP, PIIIP, LVM and LVM/h(2.7) was observed in all groups. The absolute and percent reduction in TGFbeta1 and LVM/h(2.7) were significantly higher in combined than losartan or ramipril groups and also in HT patients with LVH. No significant change in absolute and percent reduction of SBP, DBP and MBP were found. Our data indicate an additional cardioprotective effect of dual blockade of renin-angiotensin in HT patients.",

In the CAST study, encanaide and other antiarrhythmic drugs were not only ineffective but also increased mortality after myocardial infarction. Amiodarone had some beneficial effect on arrhythmic events without improving survival, and ICDs failed to improve outcome early after AMI. In comparison, short and long term survival benefits of beta blockers, angiotensine converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists after AMI is well established.

In this study, 4097 subjects with hypertension , aged 55 years and older, were included from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study in The Netherlands, from July 1, 1991 onwards. Follow-up ended at the diagnosis date of MI, stroke, death, or the end of the study period (January 1, 2002). The drug-gene interaction on the risk of MI or stroke was determined with a Cox proportional hazard model with adjustments for each drug class as time-dependent covariates. The risk of MI was increased in current use of ACE-inhibitors with the MT or TT genotype compared to ACE-inhibitors with the MM genotype (Synergy Index (SI): 4.00; 95% CI: 1.32-12.11).

In heart failure, activation of sympathetic nervous system has been described as one of the most important pathophysiologic abnormalities in patients with congestive heart failure and as one of the most important mechanisms that may be responsible for progression of heart failure. The use of beta blockers which may inhibit sympathetic activity, might reduce the risk of disease progression in heart failure, improve symptoms and increase survival. Several large clinical trials with metoprolol, carvedilol and bisoprolol have shown that long term use of these agents can improve left ventricular function and symptoms of CHF, it may also reduce hospital readmission and decrease mortality. Current guidelines recommend the use of beta blocker in mild, moderate and severe CHF, in the absence of contraindications or tolerance in combination with ACE inhibitor and diuretics. Beta blocker should be initiated in patients after maximal medical therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitor and digitalis and patients already stabilized and in compensated conditions. Beta blocker should be started in low doses and require slow titration over weeks or months before patients can attain maintenance doses.",

Risk factor modifications should include smoking cessation as well as blood pressure and cholesterol management. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is the antiplatelet of choice, and clopidogrel should be used as an alternative if ASA therapy is contraindicated or an intolerance is present. Cilostazol has a minimal role for the symptomatic relief in patients with disabling intermittent claudication.

To achieve the target systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) of <140/<90 mm Hg, imidapril was titrated from 5 to 20 mg/d and candesartan was titrated from 4 to 16 mg/d. The main end point was the change from baseline in sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough. Secondary end points were response rate, evaluation of SBP and DBP throughout the study, and change of SBP and DBP in subgroup of patients with moderate hypertension, as well as incidence and severity of adverse events related to treatment reported throughout the study.",

    "805": "In Australia the number of patients developing end-stage kidney disease is growing. Almost 70% of new cases of treated end-stage kidney disease are due to diabetes, hypertension or glomerulonephritis. The majority of these patients have a chronic decline of renal function over many years before dialysis is required, even when the initial insult is no longer present. Hypertension and the degree of proteinuria are the most important determinants for this progression and ample evidence suggests that angiotensin II is the key player in sustaining both hypertension and proteinuria. Angiotensin II mediates not only haemodynamic changes but also profibrotic and pro-inflammatory processes. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system decreases proteinuria and slows the progression of both diabetic and non-diabetic proteinuric renal disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are first-line therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are first-line therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy. Finally, treatment with ACE inhibitors delays the progression of proteinuric nephropathy in non-diabetic patients. Combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and ARB may allow a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and clinical trials show that ACE inhibitor-ARB combinations have an additive antiproteinuric effect of up to 40% compared with ACE inhibitor or ARB alone, without additional blood pressure-lowering effect. Finally, it is important to emphasize that progressive lowering of blood pressure to 120 mmHg is associated with improved renal outcome and that this effect is independent of baseline renal function.",

One hundred twenty CHF patients aged 45 to 74 were examined. The patients were studied clinically; laboratory tests included measurement of the cerum levels of cytokines with solid-phase immune enzyme assay and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with photometric turbidimetric technique; the vasoregulating function and antithrombogenic activity of vascular wall were evaluated. Improvement in the clinical condition of II to III functional class patients receiving standard therapy was associated with a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine and CRP serum levels, as well as a tendency towards improvement in the vasoregulating function and a decrease in the antithrombogenic endothelial activity, mostly due to vascular wall fibrinolytic activity. Standard therapy combined with aspirin led to less prominent changes in the patients' conditions; a simultaneous decrease in the levels of all the cytokines under study was not noted; the vasoregulating activity of the vascular endothelium decreased. The data obtained may be used as additional criteria to objectively evaluate the severity of the condition of CHF patients and to control the effectiveness of the therapy.",

The purified dioscorin having the molecular weight of about 200 kDa exhibited high scavenging activities against hydroxyl radicals (IC50 = 195.1 microg/ml) and superoxide anion radicals (IC50 = 92.7 microg/ml). Moreover, it showed extremely high angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity (IC50 = 41.1 microg/ml).

To asses prospectively the ability of these drugs to prevent type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk for developing this condition. The results provide clear evidence, that among persons with impaired fasting glucose levels or impaired glucose tolerance, the use of 15 mg ramipril for 3 years does not significantly reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes or death but does significantly increase regression to normoglycaemia. In the same population rosiglitazone at 8 mg daily for 3 years substantially reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes and increases the regression to normoglycaemia.",

    "810": "In-vitro and animal studies have shown that increased receptor expression could be linked to high blood pressure and to cardiac and glomerular fibrosis by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases and by upregulating gene expression of profibrotic molecules. Studies also suggest that the receptor is involved in diabetic nephropathy by activating receptor-bound prorenin, thereby increasing angiotensin II tissue generation. Moreover, in diabetic mice, a peptide able to block prorenin binding to the receptor was claimed to be more effective for renal protection than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "811": "The experimental data confirmed the pivotal role of the receptor in cell surface generation of angiotensin and suggested its potential role in tissue fibrosis via receptor activation and intracellular signaling.

This subject is particularly interesting because the existence of an increased cardiovascular risk associated with renal function decline has been demonstrated in many different clinical conditions including arterial hypertension. The increase in global cardiovascular risk accompanying chronic kidney disease would necessitate the use of drugs suppressing the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system for cardiovascular protection irrespective of the influence on renal outcome.",

In recent studies, a decrease in the development or recurrence of AF was found in hypertensive patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-blocking agents. Hypertension is related to an increased wall tension in the atria, resulting in increased stretch of the individual myocyte, which is one of the major stimuli for the remodeling process. In the present study, we used a model of cultured atrial neonatal rat cardiomyocytes under conditions of stretch to provide insight into the mechanisms of the preventive effect of the angiotensin receptor-blocking agent losartan against AF on a molecular level. Stretch significantly increased protein-to-DNA ratio and atrial natriuretic factor mRNA expression, indicating hypertrophy. Expression of genes encoding for the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)), Kir 2.1, and Kir 2.3, as well as the gene encoding for the ultrarapid delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kur)), Kv 1.5, was significantly increased. In contrast, mRNA expression of Kv 4.2 was significantly reduced in stretched myocytes. Alterations of gene expression correlated with the corresponding current densities: I(K1) and I(Kur) densities were significantly increased in stretched myocytes, whereas transient outward K(+) current (I(to)) density was reduced. These alterations resulted in a significant abbreviation of the action potential duration. Losartan (1 microM) prevented stretch-induced increases in the protein-to-DNA ratio and atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA expression in stretched myocytes. Concomitantly, losartan attenuated stretch-induced alterations in I(K1), I(Kur), and I(to) density and gene expression. This prevented the stretch-induced abbreviation of action potential duration. Prevention of stretch-induced electrical remodeling might contribute to the clinical effects of losartan against AF.",

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is highly prevalent and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. The purpose of this review is to assess the clinical impact of recent advances in the epidemiology, prevention, and management of CHD in diabetic patients. A systematic review of publications in this area, referenced in MEDLINE in the past 5 years (2000 to 2005), was undertaken. Patients with CHD and prediabetic states should undergo lifestyle modifications aimed at preventing DM. Pharmacological prevention of DM is also promising but requires further study. In patients with CHD and DM, routine use of aspirin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)--unless contraindicated or not tolerated-and strict glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control are strongly recommended. The targets for secondary prevention in these patients are relatively well defined, but the strategies to achieve them vary and must be individualized. Intense insulin therapy might be needed for glycemic control, and high-dose statin therapy might be needed for lipid control. For blood pressure control, ACE-Is and angiotensin receptor blockers are considered as first-line therapy. Noncompliance, particularly with lifestyle measures, and underprescription of evidence-based therapies remain important unsolved problems.",

    "829": "A sensitive and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detector was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of benazepril (BZL) and its active metabolite, benazeprilat (BZT), in human plasma. The plasma sample, after spiked with riluzole as an internal standard (IS), was subjected to a solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to a HPLC analysis. Chromatographic separations were achieved on a Hypersil BDS C(18) (300 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm). The mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer (pH 2.6; 10mM) and acetonitrile mixture in a gradient mode. Detection was carried out at a wavelength of 237 nm. The retention times of BZL, BZT and IS were at about 6.2, 15.4 and 16.2 min, respectively. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 20-2000 ng/mL for both BZL and BZT (r(2)>0.997). At three quality control concentrations of 100, 500, and 1500 ng/mL, the intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviation ranged from 2.8 to 8.6% for BZL and from 2.2 to 8.5% for BZT, while the mean absolute percentage error ranged from -7.5 to 6.7% for BZL and from -6.0 to 3.2% for BZT. The limit of detection (LOD) was 10 ng/mL and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 20 ng/mL for both BZL and BZT in human plasma. The method was successfully applied to bioequivalence evaluation of benazepril hydrochloride formulations in healthy Chinese.",

The ability of drugs to interfere with specific signal transduction pathways easing the presence of AF in hypertensive patients is promising. To date, the most effective mechanism appears to be the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs). This approach is under active investigation. Several trials have assessed the effectiveness of these drugs in the prevention of AF. Data show that both, ACEIs and ARBs, appear effective to prevent AF. However, a lack of prospective randomized double-blind trials data limits their application in absence of any other indication.",

    "841": "Therapeutic interchange is the practice of switching or dispensing drugs that are chemically distinct but therapeutically similar in terms of their efficacy, safety, and tolerability profiles. The stated goal of therapeutic interchange is to achieve an improved or neutral outcome with the new agent while reducing overall treatment costs. Until recently, most interchange programs have been limited to switches within drug classes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and generally to drugs that use the same routes of administration. Therapeutic interchange now is being applied to some biologic agents, such as those used to treat psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In some cases, these agents differ in structure and mode of administration. Patients who require a biologic agent are often difficult to manage, and the comorbidities that are prevalent in these patients further complicate management and agent selection. Population-based outcomes among various agents may not appear notably different, but because there is no a priori means to determine the effects of a given biologic agent on any individual patient, therapeutic interchange is inadvisable once a patient receiving RA or psoriasis therapy has been stabilized. However, if a biologic agent has been designated as preferred on a formulary, it is reasonable to initiate treatment with that agent in a patient who is naive to biologic therapy if that agent is not contraindicated. Respectful, two-way communication between health care professionals and managed care organizations (MCOs) will help ensure that a patient receives the appropriate therapy at the right time.",

Of 26 patients with ischemic heart disease who underwent elective cardiac catheterization, 8 patients were continuously administered nitrates, 8 patients were eccentrically administered nitrates, and 10 patients were not treated. We compared the coronary response to sublingual nitroglycerin among the 3 groups. In a coronary vessel without significant stenosis, the coronary vessel area, coronary lumen area, and mean coronary blood flow velocity after sublingual nitroglycerin were measured using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In the continuous dosing group, the maximal rate of change in the vessel area after sublingual nitroglycerin was 105 +/- 1 (mean +/- SEM) %, significantly lower than those in the untreated group and the eccentric dosing group (114 +/- 2%, 114 +/- 2%) (p < 0.01, respectively).

Tacrolimus treatment reduced proteinuria and increased serum albumin (time effect, P = 0.047 and 0.032 respectively). Compared with baseline levels, proteinuria improved by more than 50% in five patients (83.3%) and hypoalbuminaemia was corrected in four patients. The efficacy was most prominent in four patients with biopsy-proven membranous lupus nephritis, whose protienuria improved by over 80%. One patient developed biopsy-proven chronic nephrotoxicity after 10 months of tacrolimus treatment, despite non-excessive blood levels.

    "858": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) are known to have antifibrotic effects on the heart and kidney in both animal models and humans. N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline is a natural inhibitor of proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and a natural substrate of ACEi that was reported to prevent cardiac and renal fibrosis in vivo. However, it is not clear whether N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline participates in the antifibrotic effects of ACEi. To clarify this issue, we used a model of aldosterone-salt-induced hypertension in rats treated with the ACEi captopril either alone or combined with an anti-N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline monoclonal antibody. These hypertensive rats had the following: (1) left ventricular and renal hypertrophy, as well as increased collagen deposition in the left ventricular and the kidney; (2) glomerular matrix expansion; and (3) increased ED1-positive cells and enhanced phosphorylated-p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase in the left ventricle and kidney. The ACEi alone significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (P=0.008) with no effect on organ hypertrophy; it significantly lowered left ventricular collagen content, and this effect was blocked by the monoclonal antibody as confirmed by the histological data. As expected, the ACEi significantly decreased renal collagen deposition and glomerular matrix expansion, and these effects were attenuated by the monoclonal antibody. Likewise, the ACEi significantly decreased ED1-positive cells and inhibited p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in the left ventricle and kidney, and these effects were blocked by the monoclonal antibody. We concluded that in aldosterone-salt-induced hypertension, the antifibrotic effect of ACEi on the heart and kidney, is partially mediated by N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline, resulting in decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.",

Strict metabolic control and tight blood pressure control can significantly reduce the risk of developing retinopathy and its progression, but are difficult to achieve in clinical practice. Laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy are effective in preventing severe visual loss from sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy and its complications, but both modalities have potential side-effects.

Available evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) promote collateral growth in both hypertensive humans and animals; however, the specific mechanisms are not established. This study evaluated the hypothesis that collateral growth impairment in hypertension is mediated by excess superoxide produced by NAD(P)H oxidase in response to stimulation of the ANG II type 1 receptor. After ileal artery ligation, mesenteric collateral growth did not occur in untreated, young, spontaneously hypertensive rats. Significant luminal expansion occurred in collaterals of spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with the superoxide dismutase mimetic tempol, the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin, and the ACEI captopril, but not ANG II type 1 (losartan) or type 2 (PD-123319) receptor blockers. The ACEI enalapril produced equivalent reduction of arterial pressure as captopril but did not promote luminal expansion. This suggests the effects of captopril on collateral growth might result from its antioxidant properties. RT-PCR demonstrated that ANG II type 1 receptor and angiotensinogen expression was reduced in collaterals of untreated rats. This local suppression of the renin angiotensin system provides a potential explanation for the lack of effect of enalapril and losartan on collateral growth. The results demonstrate the capability of antioxidant therapies, including captopril, to reverse impaired collateral artery growth and the novel finding that components of the local renin angiotensin system are naturally suppressed in collaterals.", 
    "878": "The microcirculation largely determines peripheral vascular resistance and substantially contributes to arterial hypertension. In both human arterial hypertension and animal models of hypertension, genetic, fetal and other mechanisms associated with hypertension can reduce the formation and number of microvessels (i.e. parallel-connected arterioles and capillaries). Impaired formation of microvessels (impaired angiogenesis) and microvascular rarefaction can, on the other hand, contribute to increased peripheral resistance and raise blood pressure. Interestingly, drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT(1) receptor blockers) induce angiogenesis in vivo in the majority of animal studies. Furthermore, recent clinical studies demonstrate that long-term antihypertensive treatment increases capillary density in the skin of hypertensive patients without diabetes. These effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT(1) receptor blockers can be mediated by activation of bradykinin pathways, resulting in the generation of vascular endothelial growth factor, nitric oxide and, consequently, angiogenesis. In conclusion, specific antihypertensive drugs can induce angiogenesis and reduce or even reverse microvascular rarefaction.

Lisinopril was effectively stabilized by specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in the active site of MMP-9, and its hydrophobic group appeared to interact preferentially with the S1 site compared with the S1' site.

Patients not reaching goal BP (<130/80 mm Hg) after 4-week open-label treatment with quinapril 20 mg/d (n=374) received 40 mg/d quinapril (n=167) or 20 mg/d quinapril plus amlodipine besylate (5 mg/d; n=162) for 6 weeks. Patients receiving combination therapy vs monotherapy had significantly greater reductions in mean +/- SE sitting systolic BP (9.9+/-1.0 mm Hg vs 4.3+/-1.1 mm Hg; P<.001) and diastolic BP (6.5+/-0.6 mm Hg vs 2.7+/-0.6 mm Hg; P<.001). No significant differences between groups were observed in percentage of patients achieving goal BP (10.1% with combination therapy vs 8.2% with monotherapy). A clinically neutral effect was observed on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in both groups. Treatments were well tolerated; fewer than 3% of patients in any group discontinued due to treatment-emergent or treatment-related adverse events. In diabetic hypertensive patients, 20 mg/d quinapril plus 5 mg/d amlodipine besylate was a more effective BP-lowering strategy than monotherapy with 40 mg/d quinapril.",
