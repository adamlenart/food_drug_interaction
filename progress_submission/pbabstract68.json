The patients were treated with enalapril for 3 months in addition to diuretics and digitalis. Biopsies from the lateral vastus muscle were taken before and after treatment. Citrate synthetase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and phosphorylase activities were significantly decreased in the patients compared with controls. The number of capillaries per fibre and the number of capillaries surrounding each fibre were significantly decreased among patients. After 3 months of enalapril treatment functional class improved significantly. The lactate dehydrogenase activity increased whereas the oxidative enzymes did not change significantly. The type I, II and II A fibre areas increased significantly after enalapril treatment. We conclude that patients with chronic heart failure have decreased activity of oxidative enzymes and of phosphorylase in skeletal muscle. They also have decreased capillarization in skeletal muscle. These changes were not influenced by enalapril treatment. The increase in muscle fibre area seen after enalapril treatment could be due to increased physical activity. The cause of increased muscle lactate dehydrogenase activity after enalapril treatment needs further investigation.", 
    "1": "Left ventricular dilatation and a low ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction are independent indicators of a poor prognosis. ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. In the GISSI-3 trial, patients were randomly assigned, within 24 h of onset of myocardial infarction symptoms, to 6 weeks of treatment with lisinopril, nitroglycerin, both or neither, in an open, 2 x 2 factorial design. The study showed that early treatment in relatively unselected patients with lisinopril decreases mortality at 6 weeks and severe left ventricular dysfunction. We assessed (1) the prognostic value of pre-discharge 2-D echocardiographic variables, and (2) the effects of lisinopril on the progression of left ventricular dilatation.", 
    "2": "2-D echocardiograms were available pre-discharge in 8619 GISSI-3 trial patients discharged alive. In 6405 of these patients, a 2-D echocardiographic study was also available at 6 weeks, and at 6 months. Pre-discharge end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, and ejection fraction predicted 6-month mortality and non-fatal clinical congestive heart failure (P < 0.01). The increase in left ventricular volumes over time was significantly reduced by 6 weeks' lisinopril treatment in patients with wall motion asynergy pre-discharge of > or = 27%. Patients with wall motion asynergy < 27% showed no dilatation and lisinopril did not affect volumes at 6 months. Patients randomized to lisinopril also had smaller volumes after withdrawal of treatment at 6 weeks. Lisinopril did not affect left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "3": "2-D echocardiography independently contributes to pre-discharge risk stratification in terms of 6-month mortality and clinical heart failure after myocardial infarction, and early, short-term treatment with lisinopril in unselected myocardial infarction patients attenuates left ventricular dilatation; an effect evident in patients with larger infarcts. These results probably only partly explain the effect of lisinopril on total mortality concentrated in the first week after infarction.",

The present studies compare the early renal response to (a) an endopeptidase-24.11 (E-24.11) inhibitor (candoxatrilat) (b) an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) and (c) the combination of endopeptidase-24.11 and ACE inhibition in the rat A-V fistula model of chronic volume overload. 2. Candoxatrilat (3 and 10 mg kg-1) i.v. produced a prompt 3 fold increase in urinary sodium and cyclic GMP excretion without affecting significantly blood pressure or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 3. Lisinopril (0.03 mg kg-1) alone inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I but had no significant effect on urinary sodium excretion or blood pressure. 4. Lisinopril (0.03 mg kg-1) attenuated significantly the early natriuretic response to candoxatrilat (3 mg kg-1) and the associated rise in urinary cyclic GMP, but sodium excretion eventually reached levels associated with acute E-24.11 inhibition. 5. Doses of the dual E-24.11/ACE inhibitor, sampatrilat, that inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I reduced mean arterial blood pressure and produced a delayed natriuresis and rise in urinary cyclic GMP excretion when compared to candoxatrilat alone. 6. Concurrent administration of an ACE inhibitor reduces the early renal response to E-24.11 inhibition in the A-V fistula rat, an effect attributable to the hypotensive action of this combination.",

    "12": "Chronic hypertension has been reported to produce adverse cognitive effects in elderly individuals, perhaps by altering central nervous system hemodynamics. The beneficial or adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs on these processes are not well understood. We examined the effects of captopril (90 mg/kg/day) and propranolol (80 mg/kg/day) on cognitive function and brain blood flow in hypertensive and normotensive rats. Cognitive function was assessed by the Morris water maze, and regional brain blood flow was measured by the [14C]iodoantipyrine method. Nineteen-month-old propranolol-treated hypertensive rats exhibited poorer performance (p < .05) than control rats and had lower brain blood flows, particularly in white matter regions (p < .01). Captopril-treated hypertensive rats did not differ significantly from control rats with regard to either cognitive performance or brain blood flow. In the normotensive rats, there were no effects of either drug on cognitive performance or brain blood flow. Thus, blood pressure reduction by propranolol but not captopril has an adverse effect on cognitive function and brain blood flow in hypertensive rats.", 
    "13": "Treatment of hypertension with ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients reduces proteinuria and slows progression of nephropathy compared with agents that do not maintain declines in proteinuria. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have variable effects on proteinuria; their long-term effects on progression of diabetic nephropathy are not known. The current study examines the hypothesis that CCBs that maintain reductions in proteinuria slow progression of nephropathy associated with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) by a degree comparable to ACE inhibitors, given similar levels of blood pressure control. To test this hypothesis we randomized 52 patients with NIDDM associated nephropathy and hypertension, mean age of 63 +/- 8 years, to either the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril (N = 18), nondihydropyridine CCBs (NDCCBs), verapamil SR (N = 8) or diltiazem SR (N = 10), or the beta blocker, atenolol (N = 16). Goal blood pressure was < or = 140/90 mm Hg. Patients were followed for a mean period of 63 +/- 7 months. The primary end point was change in creatinine clearance (CCr) slope in each group. There was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure reduction among the groups over the study period (P = 0.14). The mean rate of decline in CCr was greatest in the atenolol group (-3.48 ml/min/year/1.73 m2; P < 0.0001). There was no difference in the CCr slopes between lisinopril and NDCCBs groups (P = 0.36). Proteinuria was reduced to a similar extent in the lisinopril and NDCCBs groups (P > 0.99). Therefore, in persons with renal insufficiency secondary to NIDDM, similar levels of blood pressure control with either lisinopril or NDCCBs slowed progression of renal disease to a greater extent than atenolol. Moreover, this enhanced slowing of renal disease progression correlated with sustained and significant reductions in proteinuria, findings not observed in the atenolol group.",

    "26": "We tested several peptides related to des-Arg9-bradykinin as stimulants or inhibitors of B1 (rabbit aorta, human umbilical vein) and B2 (rabbit jugular vein, guinea pig ileum, human umbilical vein) receptors. We also incubated the compounds with purified angiotensin-converting enzyme from rabbit lung to test their resistance to degradation. We evaluated apparent affinities (in terms of the affinity constant pA2) of compounds and their potential residual agonistic activities (alpha E). Bradykinin and des-Arg9-bradykinin were used as agonists for the B2 and B1 receptors, respectively. Degradation of peptides by the angiotensin-converting enzyme was prevented in the presence of a D-residue in position 7 of des-Arg9-bradykinin. Replacement of Pro7 with D-Tic combined with Leu, Ile, Ala, or D-Tic in position 8 led to weak B1 receptor antagonists, some of which had strong residual agonistic activities on the B2 receptor preparations. The use of D-beta Nal in position 7, combined with Ile in position 8 and AcLys at the N-terminal (eg, AcLys[D-beta Nal7, Ile8]des-Arg9-bradykinin) gave the most active B1 receptor antagonist (pA2 of 8.5 on rabbit aorta and human umbilical vein), which is also partially resistant to enzymatic degradation. Extension of the N-terminal end by Sar-Tyr-epsilon Ahx (used for labeling purposes) and even cold-labeling of Tyr with iodine were compatible with high, selective, and specific antagonism of the B1 receptors. We compared some compounds with some already known B1 receptor antagonists to underline the novelty of new peptidic compounds.", 
    "27": "The interlead variation in QT length on a standard electrocardiograph reflects regional repolarization differences in the heart. To investigate the association between this interlead variation (QT dispersion) and left ventricular hypertrophy, we subjected 100 untreated subjects to 12-lead electrocardiography and echocardiography. Additionally, 24 previously untreated subjects underwent a 6-month treatment study with ramipril and felodipine. In the cross-sectional part of the study, QT dispersion corrected for heart rate (QTc dispersion) was significantly correlated with left ventricular mass index (r = .30, P < .01), systolic pressure (r = .30, P < .01), the ratio of peak flow velocity of the early filling wave to peak flow velocity of the atrial wave (E/A ratio) (r = -.22, P = .02), isovolumic relaxation time (r = .31, P < .01), and age (r = .21, P < .04). In the treatment part of the study, lead-adjusted QTc dispersion decreased from 24 to 19 milliseconds after treatment, and after a subsequent 2 weeks of drug washout remained at 19 milliseconds (P < .01). The changes in left ventricular mass index at these stages were 144, 121, and 124 g/m2 (P < .01). Systolic pressure decreased from 175 to 144 mm Hg and increased again to 164 mm Hg after drug washout (P < .01). The E/A ratio (0.97, 1.02, and 1.02; P = 69) and isovolumic relaxation time (111, 112, and 112; P = .97) remained unchanged through the three assessment points. In conclusion, QT dispersion is increased in association with an increased left ventricular mass index in hypertensive individuals. Antihypertensive therapy with ramipril and felodipine reduced both parameters. If an increased QT dispersion is a predictor of sudden death in this group of individuals, then the importance of its reduction is evident.", 
    "28": "We examined accumulating evidence of the positive contribution of nitric oxide to the pharmacological effects of converting enzyme inhibitors in 36 rats rendered hypertensive, hyperinsulinemic, and hypertriglyceridemic by a fructose-enriched diet. We studied the response of blood pressure, insulin, and triglyceride levels to inhibition of either converting enzyme-kininase II, nitric oxide synthase, or both. Two weeks of the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg/kg) reduced blood pressure from 137 +/- 2 to 105 +/- 7 mm Hg, insulin from 7.6 +/- 2.0 to 2.2 +/- 1.1 pg/mL, and triglycerides from 292 +/- 37 to 163 +/- 37 mg/dL. Treatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 mg/kg) raised blood pressure from 144 +/- 7 to 170 +/- 8 mm Hg without affecting the other parameters. Two weeks of concomitant treatment with both agents blunted the hypotensive and beneficial metabolic effects of enalapril; thus, final blood pressure (141 +/- 7 mm Hg), insulin (6.4 +/- 2.4 pg/mL), and triglyceride (231 +/- 51 mg/dL) values were no different from those of untreated fructose-fed rats. These data suggest that persistent synthesis of nitric oxide contributes to the vasodilator and metabolic effects of enalapril in the fructose-fed rat model.",

    "32": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and multiple electrophysiologic abnormalities that normalize with regression of hypertrophy. For patients who have hypertension, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors produces regression of hypertrophy and a reduction in ventricular arrhythmia. It is unclear whether the reduction in ventricular arrhythmia associated with ACE inhibitor therapy is due to regression of hypertrophy alone, a direct antiarrhythmic effect of ACE inhibition, or both. We performed electrophysiologic studies in normal cats and cats with fixed left ventricular hypertrophy before and after acute intravenous administration of trandolopril. Trandolopril produced a small, consistent prolongation of monophasic action potential duration in normal and hypertrophied ventricles although this prolongation did not reach statistical significance. Trandolopril had no significant effect on effective refractory period, inducibility of arrhythmia, or ventricular fibrillation threshold in normal or hypertrophied ventricles. These data suggest that the reduction in arrhythmia associated with ACE inhibitors is not caused by a direct electrophysiologic effect but is more likely caused by regression of hypertrophy.", 
    "33": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have emerged as a significant advance in the treatment of heart failure; yet only a minority (i.e., 30% to 40%) of eligible patients are being treated with these drugs, and even among treated patients, the doses used in clinical practice are substantially lower than those used in the clinical trials that established the efficacy and safety of these agents. The preference for low doses is based on the belief that low and high doses exert similar benefits but that high doses produce more side effects. Yet, most studies indicate that large doses of ACE inhibitors produce greater hemodynamic and clinical effects than small doses, with no additional toxicity. However, it is uncertain whether the survival effects of these drugs are also related to dose. To address this question, a large multinational, double-blind clinical trial (Assessment of Treatment With Lisinopril and Survival [ATLAS]) was launched to compare the effects of low and high doses of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril on the survival of patients with heart failure. If the study demonstrates that large doses are needed to produce optimal effects on mortality, then the low dose strategies that are now widely used in clinical practice may be inadvertently nullifying the enormous potential benefits that ACE inhibitors might otherwise have on public health.", 
    "34": "This review examines the results of vasodilator therapy in patients with chronic regurgitant lesions of the aortic and mitral valves. The analysis includes those studies which provide data on hemodynamic measurements, left ventricular systolic function, ventricular volumes and regurgitant flow. In patients with chronic aortic or mitral regurgitation, the short-term administration of nitroprusside, hydralazine, nifedipine or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor produces salutary hemodynamic effects. The major difference in the response to combined preload and afterload reduction (i.e., nitroprusside) in patients with aortic versus mitral regurgitation was that forward stroke volume generally increased and ejection fraction remained unchanged in mitral regurgitation, whereas ejection fraction generally increased and forward stroke volume remained unchanged in aortic regurgitation. These observations suggest that a reciprocal relation between regurgitant and forward flow characterizes the response to preload and afterload reduction in mitral regurgitation (through a preload-dependent dynamic regurgitant orifice), whereas correction of afterload mismatch dominates the response in aortic regurgitation. In studies of long-term vasodilator therapy in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation, a reduction in left ventricular volumes and regurgitant fraction, with or without an increase in ejection fraction, has been observed during treatment with hydralazine, nifedipine and ACE inhibitors. Patients with the largest, sickest hearts generally benefit the most from treatment with vasoactive drugs. Nonetheless, favorable ventricular remodeling has been reported in asymptomatic patients, and long-term nifedipine use has delayed the need for operation in asymptomatic patients with chronic aortic regurgitation. For patients with chronic mitral regurgitation, definition of the etiology of the lesion is a prerequisite for choosing appropriate therapy. Excluding patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mitral valve prolapse, and some with fixed-orifice (i.e., rheumatic) mitral regurgitation, the signal importance of preload reduction suggests that the preferred long-term therapy for symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation is an ACE inhibitor. There are no long-term studies that support the use of vasodilator therapy in asymptomatic patients with chronic mitral regurgitation.",

D-penicillamine or alpha-mercaptoproprionylglycine was added for failure of hydration and alkalization to prevent new stones or stone growth, or to cause dissolution. Captopril was added for failure of or intolerance to D-penicillamine or alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine. Radiography was performed every 6 to 12 months, at which time stone events were documented.",

During a total treatment time of 104.1 patient-years 88 stone events occurred in 14 of 16 patients (0.84 events per patient-year).", 
    "38": "D-penicillamine and alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine are effective in decreasing the rate of stone formation in patients in whom hydration and alkalization failed. While captopril may also be beneficial in this setting, it does not appear to be as effective as D-penicillamine or alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine, and it does not clearly add clinical benefit to those thiols. Our study demonstrates that patients with cystinuria are at high risk for recurrence when treated with any contemporary medical program. This natural history must be considered when evaluating the long-term efficacy of newer or alternative modes of medical and urological treatment.", 
    "39": "Angiotensin II antagonists are a promising new class of antihypertensive agents. Unlike angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, these new agents block the renin-angiotensin system by acting directly on the angiotensin II receptor.

Current clinical trials on primary prevention may confirm the indications for this new therapeutic class in a near feature.", 
    "40": "The effects of peptidase inhibitors on the antinociceptive induced by intrathecally (i.t.) administered by dynorphin A and dynorphin B in the mouse formalin test were examined. When administered i.t. 5 min before the injection of 0.5% formalin solution into the dorsal surface of a hindpaw, dynorphin A (0.5-2 nmol) and dynorphin B (2-8 nmol) produced a dose-dependent and significant reduction of the paw-licking response. Dynorphin A (2 nmol) and dynorphin B (8 nmol)-induced antinociception disappeared completely within 90 min and 60 min, respectively. p-Hydroxymercuribenzoate, a cysteine proteinase inhibitor, and phosphoramidon, and endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor simultaneously administered with dynorphin A or dynorphin B. Significantly prolonged antinociception induced by both dynorphins. However, captopril, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, bestatin (a general aminopeptidase inhibitor) and a serine proteinase inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, were active. Dynorphin converting enzyme(s) transform dynorphin-related peptides to [Leu5]enkephalin and [Leu5]enkephalin-Arg6. Neither [Leu5]enkephalin nor [Leu5]enkephalin-Arg6, even at high dose (10 nmol), produced any antinociceptive effect. However, [Leu5[enkephalin-Arg6, but not [Leu5]enkephalin, produced a significant antinociceptive effect when co-administered with phosphoramidon. Therefore, the prolongation of the antinociception induced by both dynorphins in the presence of phosphoramidon, may be due to inhibition of [Leu5]enkephalin-Arg6 degradation. The present results indicate that dynorphin-converting enzyme(s) may be important enzyme(s) responsible for terminating dynorphin-A- and dynorphin-B-induced antinociception at the spinal cord level in mice.", 
    "41": "Water intake was examined in young (3-5 months) and old (20-24 months) rats following peripheral administration of either angiotensin (Ang) II or captopril+bradykinin (BK). Relative to body weight, intake after Ang II showed no age-related difference, while that after captopril+BK was markedly reduced in the old rats. In other rats that were not allowed to drink after captopril+BK, the induction of Fos-like immunoreactivity (IR) was much lower in the subfornical organ, supraoptic and median preoptic nuclei of old rats compared with their young counterparts. Intake of 0.15 M NaCl during chronic dietary administration of enalapril was robust in young rats but was much reduced in old rats, as was their plasma renin activity. Thus, reduced thirst and sodium appetite are found in conjunction with kininase II (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors in aging rats, possibly because they fail to generate the high levels of circulating renin seen in young rats under these conditions.", 
    "42": "The increasing usage of ACE-inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure may increase the incidence of adverse anaesthetic occurrences. Four such cases are described. In two of these cases, the patient reacted with severe hypotension when general anaesthesia was supplemented with epidural bupivacaine. Another patient suffered a heart fatality after severe hypotension in conjunction with the administration of a spinal anaesthetic. Finally, one patient suffered sudden fatal pulmonary oedema after completion of uneventful general anaesthesia, possibly due to late resumption of ACEI-treatment. The cases are discussed in detail, with particular reference to the possible underlying mechanisms. Preoperative discontinuation of ACEI-treatment is controversial. We present some of the issues involved. Most authors lean towards continuing ongoing treatment, even though there is firm evidence that this increases the risk of hypotensive episodes due to hypovolaemia, arguing that such events may be predicted and antagonized with fluid therapy.",

    "47": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in most developed countries. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and vitamin E therapy may retard the atherosclerotic process; however, definitive proof in humans is lacking. The Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound Changes in Patients Treated with Ramipril and Vitamin E (SECURE) is designed to assess the effects of ramipril--an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, at 2 doses: 2.5 mg daily (which has little effect on lowering blood pressure) and 10 mg daily--and the antioxidant vitamin E, 400 IU daily, on atherosclerosis progression in 732 patients using a factorial 3 x 2 study design. High-risk patients with a documented history of significant cardiovascular disease or with diabetes and additional risk factors were enrolled and will be followed for 4 years. The extent and progression of atherosclerosis are assessed noninvasively by B-mode carotid ultrasonography. The SECURE trial is a substudy of the larger Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study of 9,541 high-risk patients evaluating the effects of ramipril and vitamin E on major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke). The 2 studies are complementary. Whereas HOPE is expected to provide information on major clinical outcomes, SECURE will shed light on the mechanisms by which these effects may be mediated.", 
    "48": "The present study enrolled 214 patients, aged 26 to 83 years, with symptomatic New York Heart Association class II through IV congestive heart failure. Patients were continued on their previous therapeutic regimens, which included an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a loop diuretic with or without digitalis. Patients were randomized to 1 of 5 parallel treatment groups: placebo or spironolactone at a single daily dose of 12.5, 25, 50, or 75 mg for 12 weeks. Serum levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium, plasma renin activity, and N-terminal proatrial natriuretic factor (pro-ANF), as well as urinary aldosterone levels, were measured periodically. Measurements at 12 weeks versus baseline values indicated significant increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone excretion and significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pro-ANF. Hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.4 mmol/L) occurred in 10% of placebo-treated patients and in 0.5% of the spironolactone group. The incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > or = 5.5 mmol/L) was 5% for the placebo group, whereas it was 5%, 13%, 20%, and 24% for the 12.5-, 25-, 50- and 75-mg spironolactone treatment groups, respectively. Predictors of hyperkalemia included the use of ACE inhibitors other than captopril, ACE inhibitor dose, and baseline elevation of serum creatinine or potassium levels. Thus, daily doses of 12.5 to 25 mg of spironolactone coadministered with conventional therapy of ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, and digitalis are relatively safe (provided that serum potassium levels are monitored) and effective in blocking the effects of aldosterone, while reducing the potential for hypokalemia in patients with heart failure.",

Participants had an ejection fraction of < 0.35 and either symptomatic CHF (treatment trial, n = 2,465) or asymptomatic CHF (prevention trial, n = 2,560). Baseline assessment of HRQL predicted mortality and CHF-related hospitalizations in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients randomized to enalapril and placebo treatment. Domains that were the stronger univariate predictors of mortality and CHF-related hospitalizations were activities of daily living (relative risk [RR] for mortality: 1.163, p < 0.000; for hospitalization: 1.215, p < 0.000), general health (RR for mortality: 1.205, p < 0.000; for hospitalization: 1.188, p < 0.000), and social functioning (RR for mortality 1.098, p < 0.000; for hospitalization: RR 1.156, p < 0.000). In the multivariate model, activities of daily living (RR for mortality 1.41, p < 0.000; for hospitalization: RR 1.43, p < 0.002), general health (RR for mortality 1.21, p < 0.000; for hospitalization RR 1.16, p < 0.013) and heart failure symptoms (RR for mortality 1.02, p < 0.025; for hospitalization RR 1.03, p < 0.004) were found to be independent risk factors. HRQL independently predicted mortality and CHF-related hospitalizations after adjustment for ejection fraction, age, treatment, and New York Heart Association classification in patients with an ejection fraction of < 0.35, randomized to enalapril and placebo treatment.

Quinapril reduced the development of pulmonary hypertension after 12 days of hypoxia from 26 +/- 1 to 19 +/- 1 mm Hg (P < .05). When started in established pulmonary hypertension, quinapril reduced pulmonary artery pressure and total pulmonary resistance index from 29 +/- 1 to 25 +/- 1 mm Hg and from 0.136 +/- 0.01 to 0.101 +/- 0.005 mm Hg .mL-1.min-1 per kg, respectively (P < .05). Chronically hypoxic rats showed a small pulmonary vasoconstrictor response that was not affected by quinapril. In contrast, percent medial thickness in alveolar duct blood vessels was reduced by quinapril treatment both in developing and in established pulmonary hypertension (10.0 +/- 0.2% versus 8.9 +/- 0.1% [P < .05] and 11.2 +/- 0.2% versus 9.1 +/- 0.2% [P < .05], respectively). 5'-Bromo-deoxyuridine-positive VSMCs were detected in 56 +/- 3% of hypoxic control pulmonary resistance vessels versus 41 +/- 3% of vessels after quinapril treatment (P < .05).",

    "53": "Despite the availability and use of effective methods for limiting infarct size with thrombolytic agents and primary angioplasty, patients experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI) are at increased risk for a second cardiac event in the post-MI period (e.g., reinfarction, heart failure, and sudden death). For this reason, postinfarction risk management is crucial. An extensive data base has firmly established the efficacy of beta blockers in reducing cardiovascular risk following acute MI. The full advantages of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have only recently begun to emerge as the result of a growing understanding of the mechanisms of adverse outcomes following MI. The importance of lipid-lowering agents, in particular the \"statins,\" should be considered in all post-MI patients, especially since recent studies have conclusively shown improved survival and reduced rates of MI and coronary artery bypass surgery in this population with this therapy. Aspirin is now considered a standard part of the early management of the acute infarct patient as well as for secondary prevention in post-MI patients. At present, chronic anticoagulation with warfarin should be reserved for selected patients. The nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists diltiazem and verapamil can be considered for post-MI use only in patients in whom beta blockers are contraindicated and who have preserved systolic function and/or those without clinical heart failure. In contrast, the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, particularly nifedipine, have no role in secondary prevention. Although long-term benefits are minimal, nitrates continue to be useful in post-MI patients with residual ischemia (angina or silent ischemia), heart failure (systolic or diastolic), or postinfarction hypertension. Antiarrhythmic agents, except amiodarone, are relatively contraindicated in post-MI patients. Recent data show that vitamin E reduces the rate of nonfatal MI. Its role in cardiovascular death and overall mortality remains to be clarified. Despite their demonstrated value, agents used in secondary prevention generally appear to be underutilized. In addition, when pharmacologic therapies are administered for secondary prevention, they are often prescribed at lower doses than those tested and proved in trials. A greater appreciation for the efficacy and safety profiles of these agents could lead to more widespread use and more pronounced reductions in morbidity and mortality among post-MI patients.", 
    "54": "Several studies are reviewed in which behavioral aspects of angiotensin (Ang) II on fluid intake have been compared with induction of the immediate early gene product, Fos, as a marker of neuronal activation in rat bain. Either peripheral or central administration of Ang II induced Fos along the lamina terminalis (SFO, MnPO, AV3V) and in the magnocellular neurosecretory groups (SO, PVH). A similar pattern is seen with central injection of renin. Both pharmacological and antisense oligonucleotide probe studies indicate that an AT1 receptor is involved, probably with the initial transduction in the SFO. Treatments that induce sodium appetite all induce Fos along the lamina terminalis, but usually not in the SO or PVN. Kininase II inhibitors, such as captopril, acutely potentiate drinking to Ang I, but after chronic exposure they may inhibit water intake. In contrast, the dipsogenic effect of bradykinin which is manifest in the presence of acute captopril remains unaffected by chronic administration. This suggests that the sodium appetite that appears with chronic captopril treatment may depend in part on peptides other than Ang.", 
    "55": "This study investigated the role of brain angiotensin (Ang II) in thirst induced by hemorrhage. Hemorrhage by blood withdrawal from the femoral artery to 33% and 44% blood volume loss produces a dose response increase in plasma Ang II. In the brainstem there was no Ang II response to hemorrhage. In the hypothalamus, Brain Ang II was maximally elevated to 33% hemorrhage. Thus, plasma Ang II and brain Ang II had an independent response to hemorrhage. To further test the role of central versus peripheral Ang II, we tested the effect of central (50 mg) and peripheral (50 mg/kg) administration of captopril or central injection of 1 mg losartan or 3 mg CGP 42112A prior to a 33% hemorrhage in unanesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g). Drinking was measured and AVP blood samples were taken before and after hemorrhage. The results show that central (i.v.t.) administration of captopril and losartan inhibited drinking compared to controls (0.33 +/- 0.3 ml vs. 2.3 +/- 0.8 ml: P < 0.05 and 0.20 +/- 0.09 ml vs.3.05 +/- 0.81 ml; P < 0.01, respectively) while peripheral (i.p.) captopril alone increased drinking in response to hemorrhage (5.81 +/- 0.81 ml vs. 2.3 +/- 0.8 ml; P < 0.05). AVP levels were elevated at 5 and 15 min, but neither injections of losartan or CGP 42112A i.v.t. affected this response to hemorrhage. We conclude that increased hypothalamic brain Ang II after hypovolemic hemorrhage stimulates thirst and blood pressure restoration and acts through AT1 receptors. The release of AVP in hemorrhage, however, does not rely exclusively on the angiotensinergic pathway in the brain.", 
    "56": "We assessed the effects of idrapril, a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and captopril in the isolated rat heart after ischaemia and reperfusion and measured angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in myocardial tissue. Hearts were perfused and subjected to global ischaemia and reperfusion. Idrapril (0.1, 1, 10, and 50 micrograms/ml), captopril (80 micrograms/ml) or vehicle were given before ischaemia and throughout reperfusion. Post-ischaemic recovery of coronary flow was significantly decreased with 50 micrograms/ml of idrapril (43 +/- 9% compared to 64 +/- 3% in controls) whereas heart rate was unaffected. Recovery of developed pressure and activity of cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme were significantly reduced by idrapril in a dose-dependent manner. This study suggests that protection or lack of protection by idrapril on recovery of contractile function seems to depend on the degree of inhibition of tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in the setting of acute heart ischaemic insult. Our results suggest that while a certain degree of inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the heart is beneficial, marked tissue inhibition may be deleterious.", 
    "57": "In vitro and in vivo data provide evidence for an interaction between the renin-angiotensin and fibrinolytic systems. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is strategically poised to regulate this interaction. ACE catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Ang), and Ang II stimulates release of PAI-1, the major inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase in the vasculature. Conversely, ACE catalyzes the breakdown of bradykinin, a potent stimulus of t-PA secretion. This interaction between the renin-angiotensin and fibrinolytic systems may partially explain the clinical observation that stimulation or suppression of the renin-angiotensin system can alter the risk of ischemic cardiovascular events. \u00a9 1996, Elsevier Science Inc.

    "58": "BACKGROUND: In congestive heart failure with water retention, subtraction of body fluid by ultrafiltration causes greater diuresis and clinical improvement in patients who are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibited, suggesting an influence of ACE inhibitors on fluid metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with moderate congestive heart failure were subjected to ultrafiltration (around 2000 mL) and followed up for 3 months. Usual outpatient therapy, consisting of digoxin, furosemide, and ACE inhibitors (18 patients, group A) and of digoxin and furosemide only (18 patients, group B), was continued throughout the trial. Hemodynamics, renal function, body fluid and electrolytes, plasma norepinephrine, renin activity, aldosterone, and plasma volume were monitored. At 30 and 90 days after ultrafiltration, hormones, renal function, functional capacity (based on cardiopulmonary tests), and extravascular lung water (chest radiograph score) were determined. Soon after ultrafiltration, body weight, plasma volume, and diuresis were reduced (hypovolemia) and hormones were raised (reaction to hypovolemia). In the next 4 days, all these variables reverted to the pre-ultrafiltration values in group B; in group A diuresis and plasma volume recovered, body weight was still reduced, and hormones became lower than baseline. These changes persisted in the next 3 months. An early reduction of extravascular lung water continued long term in group A only, associated with increase of exercise tolerance time and oxygen uptake and decrease of the dead space/tidal volume ratio. CONCLUSIONS: In congestive heart failure, ACE inhibition persistently prevented fluid accumulation once the excess of body fluid had been withdrawn with a nonpharmacologic method, resulting in sustained improvement in functional capacity. Reduction in circulating norepinephrine, aldosterone, and renin did not seem to be the cause but the consequence of this action, whose mechanisms remain undefined.", 
    "59": "The effect of angiotensin II on adrenal cortisol secretion was studied using incubated adrenal tissues of cells preparation of guinea pig and dog. The results showed that: the cortisol secretion in guinea pigs was increased by the addition of angiotensin II in both dose-dependent and time-dependent manner at concentration > or = 10(-9) mol/L (P < 0.01). When ACTH was further added to the angiotensin primed preparation, the output of cortisol was further increased. Deprivation of free calcium largely suppressed the production of cortisol induced by angiotensin II (P < 0.05). These results suggested that angiotensin II exerts a direct effect on the secretion of adrenal cortisol, which required the presence of Ca2+ and is promoted by ACTH.",

They produce a clinical and hemodynamic relief of preload, afterload or both during the resting state or exercise. Although left ventricular hypertrophy is an adaptative response to myocardial stress, in the long run it becomes an independent risk factor leading to diastolic dysfunction. At present, pharmacological regression of ventricular hypertrophy has a prognostic importance. Of the large number of available vasodilators, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have proved to be the most successful drugs. They behave as afterload relievers, counteracting both the renin-angiotensin and adrenergic systems, but also are powerful inhibitors of cardiomyocite enlargement and interstitial connective tissue proliferation.

    "66": "The sensory neuropeptide, substance P (SP), is present in human airway nerves, beneath and within the epithelium where the condensed localization of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), the major enzyme degrading SP, is observed. To test the hypothesis whether SP stimulates the cough reflex and NEP modifies the cough reflex, we studied the cough response to various stimuli in awake guinea-pigs. Inhibition of NEP with phosphoramidon caused cough, which was inhibited by systemic capsaicin treatment and by aerosols of a specific NK1 receptor antagonist FK 888. Aerosols of FK 888 also inhibited cough induced by bronchoconstricting agents such as acetylcholine and histamine in non-sensitized animals and by ovalbumin antigen in animals sensitized to ovalbumin. The number of coughs induced by histamine aerosols was inhibited by systemic capsaicin treatment and enhanced by pretreatment with a NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon. Likewise, FK 888 inhibited the augmented cough response to aerosolized capsaicin in female guinea-pigs treated with a long-term medication of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril. In humans, aerosols of SP did not cause cough in normal subjects, whereas it did in patients with common colds. The SP fragment a major metabolite of SP produced by NEP, was less effective compared with SP in these patients, suggesting that damaged epithelium may facilitate the penetration of SP. These findings suggest that SP released from sensory nerves in response to stimuli may mediate cough and NEP may have a role in modulating SP-induced effects.",

    "76": "Cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction denotes changes of left ventricular shape, chamber size and wall thickness. It involves both the infarcted and the noninfarcted segments. This process begins at the time of acute myocardial infarction, progresses by stages, and can lead to congestive heart failure. The major determinants of lest ventricular remodeling are infarct size and transmural, adequacy of the healing process, mechanical deformation forces, and progressive ventricular dilation. Infarct expansion is a relatively frequent, early occurring alteration of the ventricular shape. It denotes thinning and lengthening of the infarct segment. The progressive ventricular remodeling can be halted by reactive hypertrophy of the viable myocytes, on condition that it is appropriate. The left ventricular increase results from myocytes hypertrophy, partly their hyperplasia, and increase of fibrosis. Major ways of action in order to limit the cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction are: reperfusion of the infarct-related vessel by thrombolysis, nitrate therapy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors administration. Maximum benefit is when therapy is begun very early.",

    "81": "The aim of modern therapy of heart failure is not a pure removal of symptoms but an improvement of survival. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors reduced morbidity and mortality in several large clinical trials in patients with dysfunctional left ventricle or manifestant heart failure. Thus, ACE inhibitors are recommended for heart failure treatment as a drug of primary option, unless contraindications are present, and if tolerated by patient. The mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors in heart failure is hypothetical. Participation of three factors is supposed: improvement in the pumping function of the failing heart, reduction on the risk of sudden death and reduction in myocardial infarction incidence. Reduction of hemodynamic load, antiischemic action and reduction of fibrotic tissue proliferation in failing myocardium are responsible for heart function improvement. These mechanisms together with potential antiatherosclerotic, antiaggregative, fibrinolytic and protective effect on endothelial function are supposed to participate in reduction of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death origin. The mentioned effects are determined by interaction with both circulating and local renin-angiotensin systems. The negative hemodynamic effects and undesirable restructuralisation of the affected ventricle are thus influenced on systematic and local-tissue level. Similarly as any other therapy also the treatment of heart failure with ACE inhibitors needs experience and a rational well tailored individual approach. (Fig.1, Ref. 32.).", 
    "82": "Acute myocardial infarction, major cause of death in Western society, has been the focus of many clinical investigations over the past decade. As the result of randomized trials involving hundreds of thousands of infarct patients worldwide, the life-saving potential of several pharmacologic interventions has been validated, and the usefulness of other commonly used treatments has been disproven or brought into question. Much of the innovative therapy has been targeted toward limiting myocardial damage by eradicating the occlusive thrombus or otherwise restoring flow through the infarct-related artery, reducing oxygen demands in the injured ventricle, and altering vascular dynamics to limit the process of ventricular remodeling. Data have accumulated showing substantially lower mortality of acute myocardial infarction with simple pharmacological interventions such as intravenous thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors. In particular, ACE-inhibitors have recently proven to be effective in infarcted patients, especially in high-risk subjects with acute anterior infarction not treated with thrombolytic agents or patients with left ventricular dysfunction. ACE-inhibitors may limit the process of ventricular remodeling after a large infarction, lessening the risk of sudden death and heart failure. Intravenous heparin has a role in maintaining patency of infarct-related vessel after rt-PA, and it seems that this combination offers some benefits with respect to streptokinase plus subcutaneous heparin. Recent studies have also demonstrated the importance of lipid-lowering agents for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Several previously recommended therapies (routine intravenous lidocaine, calcium channel blockers, magnesium, nitrates) have not been proven to be life-saving.",

Some clinical observations suggest that in many aged patients with long-standing hypertension the appearance of renal failure may be related to atheromatous reno-vascular disease. This disease may be responsible for progressive renal failure through renal artery stenosis and/or cholesterol microembolization.", 
    "84": "The prevalence of microalbuminuria in patients with essential hypertension ranges between 10 and 25%. The level of albuminuria is highly correlated with arterial pressure and more closely ambulatory arterial pressure. The interaction between albuminuria and arterial pressure is clearly enhanced by overweight and smoking. The renal mechanisms of microalbuminuria are not well elucidated; an increase in filtration fraction suggestive of intraglomerular hypertension was observed in patients with hyperfiltration. The significance of micro-albuminuria as a marker of cardiovascular risk or hypertensive renal disease needs to be confirmed through long-term follow-up studies. Antihypertensive treatment has variable influence on albuminuria; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in contrast to other agents, tend to partially correct this abnormality.",

Although mean isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) and transmitral E (early) to A (late) filling velocity (E/A) ratio were not different from normal, a value of 1.0 on the normal frequency plot of the E/A ratio divided the patients bimodally into two groups: 20 patients (group A) with E/A ratio > 1.0 and 10 patients (group B) < 1.0. In group A patients, IVRT was short as was transmitral E wave deceleration time compared to normal (P < 0.001), fulfilling the criteria of restrictive left ventricular physiology. Left ventricular wall motion during IVRT was coordinate and left ventricular end diastolic pressure was raised on the apex-cardiogram (P < 0.001). In group B, E wave deceleration time was longer, relaxation incoordinate, and apexcardiogram normal. With an ACE inhibitor: in group A, left ventricular dimensions fell at end diastole (P < 0.05) and end systole (P < 0.01) but fractional shortening did not change; long axis total excursion (P < 0.01) and peak rate of shortening (P < 0.05) both increased; IVRT increased (P < 0.001) with the appearance of markedly incoordinate wall motion, minor axis lengthening, and long axis shortening (P < 0.001 for both); A wave amplitude also consistently increased (P < 0.001); finally, transmitral E wave velocity fell and A wave velocity increased. ACE inhibition did not alter any of the left ventricular minor and long axis or transmitral Doppler variables in patients in group B.", 
    "90": "Patients with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure differ in their presentation and response to ACE inhibition according to baseline haemodynamics. In restrictive left ventricular physiology, ACE inhibition reduces cavity size and prolongs IVRT, compatible with a fall in left atrial pressure. At the same time, ventricular relaxation becomes very delayed and incoordinate, greatly reducing early diastolic left ventricular filling velocity. Thus ACE inhibition unmasks major diastolic abnormalities in patients with restrictive left ventricular disease.",

    "92": "Cough is one of the commonest symptoms of lung disease and is a frequent problem encountered in general practice as well as in hospital practice. A wide range of disease processes may present with cough and definitive treatment depends on making an accurate diagnosis of the cause. A diagnostic work-up for patients with persistent dry cough is presented. The most common associated conditions are post-viral cough, asthma, rhinosinusitis (post-nasal drip or 'nasal catarrh') and gastro-oesophageal reflux. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can also lead to a persistent dry cough. Specific treatment of the cause should control the cough, but this may not occur in all cases and in a sizeable proportion of patients, no associated cause can be found. An increased sensitivity of the cough reflex can be observed in patients with persistent dry cough. Symptomatic relief must be considered when the cough interferes with the patient's health and sleep but the most effective antitussive opiates cause sedation and may be addictive. Treatment of persistent dry cough remains a challenge in some patients and there is still scope for improvement in its diagnosis and effective therapy.", 
    "93": "Heart failure is common in the elderly and is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. It accounts for about 5% of adult medical admissions and the expenditure of 1% of the total National Health Service budget. Clinical presentation in old age may be with the classical symptoms of heart failure but often, due to multiple pathology and low functional ability, presentation is atypical. Both nonspecific symptoms and signs of heart failure, are often a delayed presentation in this population, make diagnosis difficult. Treatment of the failing heart in an older person is similar to the young however, diligence is required when prescribing due to age-related pharmacokinetic changes and co-existent morbidity. This may result in polypharmacy and an increase in drug interactions which themselves may have deleterious consequences. However, knowledge of the aetiology of heart failure in old age and the possible atypical presentation as well as available treatments, will result in better management and improved quality of life and reduced mortality in the elderly heart failure population.", 
    "94": "Numerous studies suggest that the renin angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study we produced cardiac hypertrophy in rats subjected to abdominal aortic banding and also induced cardiac regression by the administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, at 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. Each drug was administered to the rats for 6 weeks from 6 weeks after aortic banding. The left ventricular weight significantly decreased at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day of enalapril as well as the systolic blood pressure. Using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, the increased levels of ACE and AT1 mRNA were significantly inhibited in the aortic banding rats treated with the above concentrations of enalapril. The ACE activity in both the plasma and heart tissue preparations was significantly inhibited by enalapril. Similar observations were also seen after the administration of angiotensin type 1 receptor blockade, E-4177, into the aortic banding rats. The treatment with enalapril at 3 mg/kg/day did not reduce the left ventricular weight or the systolic blood pressure in the aortic banding rats. However, this low-dose treatment did significantly decrease the left ventricle to body weight ratio in the aortic banding rats without a reduction of the systolic blood pressure. Therefore, using the low-dose enalapril, the ACE activity in plasma was in part inhibited and the levels of ACE mRNA also decreased in the heart tissue of aortic banding rats, while the level of AT1 mRNA showed no such decrease. These results thus indicate that chronic ACE inhibitor at low doses has a beneficial effect on the regression in the pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy. It is thus assumed that this effect may also contribute to the presence of an alternate pathway for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II which might also act as a possible mechanism for cardiac regression.",

In order to study the role of angiotensin II in the increase of cardiac mass, these animals were treated with antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive doses of the angiotensin II receptor AT1 antagonist Telmisartan for 9 weeks. All doses led to significant reductions of heart hypertrophy detected by the evaluation of the diameter of cardiac muscle bundles. We conclude from this study that cardiac hypertrophy in TGR(mREN2)27 is characterized by an increased volume of cardiomyocytes and an unchanged amount of fibrous tissue and that angiotensin II plays an important role in the mechanisms leading to this phenotype.", 
    "96": "Rapid growth of the left ventricle of the newborn pig heart can be restrained by treating piglets with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate. This reduced rate of growth is reflected in vitro by reduced rates of ribosome formation and protein synthesis, and may be due to decreased availability of angiotensin II (AII), a potentially hypertrophic agent; decreased numbers of AII receptors; increased availability of bradykinin, a potentially antihypertrophic agent; or reduced hemodynamic load on the left ventricle. Because enalapril decreases degradation of bradykinin, the role of bradykinin as an inhibitor of cardiac growth in the newborn heart was investigated. Addition of 1 x 10(-5) M bradykinin and 1 x 10(-6) M enalapril to the perfusate of isolated hearts from 2 day old piglets did not significantly alter heart rate, contents of ATP or creatine phosphate or rates of ribosome formation or protein synthesis during 1 h of perfusion. Similarly, exposure of myocytes isolated from the left ventricular free wall of piglets to 5 x 10(-6) M bradykinin for 72 h did not alter the rate of [3H]-phenylalanine incorporation into total protein. The reduced rate of left ventricular growth in vivo caused by enalapril administration was not reversed by simultaneous treatment with the specific bradykinin receptor antagonist, HOE 140. HOE 140 alone did not alter ventricular growth as compared to hearts from untreated piglets. In summary, these results demonstrate that the reduced rate of left ventricular growth in vivo and the reduced rate of ribosome formation and protein synthesis in the left ventricle in vitro after enalapril treatment of piglets is not the result of an inhibitory effect of bradykinin on cardiac growth.",

    "102": "One adverse effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors used for treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure is the production of dry coughs. Imidapril is a new type of ACE inhibitor with a very low incidence of coughs. The magnitude and the mechanism of cough potentiation of imidapril and other ACE inhibitors has been studied in guinea-pigs. In normal guinea-pigs single and repeated dosing of imidapril at 0.1 to 100 mg kg-1 had no effect on capasaicin- or citric acid-induced coughs. Single and repeated dosing of enalapril and captopril at 10 to 30 mg kg-1, respectively, significantly increased the number of capsaicin-induced coughs. Repeated dosing of 1 mg kg-1 enalapril also significantly augmented the capsaicin cough. In bronchitic guinea-pigs imidapril also had no effect on the coughs induced by the two stimulants. Enalapril and captopril significantly increased the number of coughs induced not only by capsaicin but also by citric acid. Lower doses of enalapril were enough to augment the capsaicin-induced coughs, whereas medium to large doses failed to augment the cough irrespective of the protocol of administration. Bradykinin-induced discharges of the vegal afferents from the lower airway were significantly increased by enalaprilat but not by imidaprilat. Capsaicin-induced discharges of the afferents were, on the other hand, significantly depressed by enalaprilat, but not by imidaprilat. Interestingly, enalaprilat depression of the discharges was significantly reversed by Hoe-140, a bradykinin B2 receptor blocker. In guinea-pigs pretreated with a low dose of enalapril, arterial infusion of bradykinin significantly potentiated the coughs induced by capsaicin. The results indicated that imidapril was less potent than enalapril and captopril in potentiating cough responses induced by capsaicin and citric acid in guinea-pigs, and further suggest that bradykinin might be a key substance in the mechanism of the potentiation of coughs associated with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "103": "Although the value of beta-blockers in secondary prevention of infarction has been largely demonstrated, the role of calcium channel blockers has remained controversial for a long time. However, some subgroups of infarction may benefit from these drugs: limited infarction, without Q wave, infarction without left ventricular dysfunction. The beneficial effect is essentially observed with bradycardic calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) and provided treatment is deferred for several days after the acute phase of myocardial necrosis. In the light of the results of the DAVIT II and CRIS studies, verapamil is a reasonable alternative to beta-blockers in secondary prevention of infarction, when beta-blockers are contraindicated especially because of asthma or chronic respiratory failure. It can obviously be associated with other treatments with a demonstrated value in post-infarction (especially aspirin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors).", 
    "104": "The mortality of heart failure remains high despite recent therapeutic progress. The objectives of treatment are to relieve symptoms, but also to improve survival. The secondary objectives are extension of the duration of effort, improvement of the ejection fraction, reduction of arrhythmias and neuroendocrine disturbances, although these criteria are not strictly related to the primary objectives. Diuretics should be used from the first symptoms, but their effect on survival has not been evaluated. Digitalis alkaloids, with no effect on survival, also improve functional signs, even in patients in sinus rhythm. All other positive inotropic agents increase mortality. Nitrates improve symptoms and, when associated with hydralazine, prolong survival. Amiodarone should be reserved to patients with dangerous arrhythmias. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have the best demonstrated effect on survival and must be used as first-line treatment. Their preventive effect on mortality is limited, except in post-infarction ventricular dysfunction. Beta-blockers, which appear very promising for the improvement of survival, functional signs and ejection fraction, are currently under evaluation. Their mechanisms of action and the choice of the most active drugs have yet to be determined.", 
    "105": "Based on animal experiments it has been proposed that antihypertensive agents may differentially influence albuminuria through their divergent effects on glomerular haemodynamics or glomerular sieving properties and may beneficially influence the progression of diabetic nephropathy even without an effect on blood pressure. However, to date this hypothesis has not been tested in normotensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. The main aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effects of the administration of two antihypertensive agents on albuminuria during rest and exercise. The study consisted of 3 x 3 randomised, cross-over periods with five days double blind administration of enalapril (E: 2.5 mg bid), nitrendipine (N: 5 mg bid) and placebo (P) on 18 Type 1 normotensive (blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) diabetic patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy (albuminuria 30-300 mg/24 h, normal glomerular filtration rate, diabetes duration > 6 years and presence of diabetic reinopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of enalapril and nitrendipine on blood pressure values and albuminuria during exercise challenge (bicycle ergometry: 20 min at 75 W and 20 min at 100 W) in comparison to the placebo. Albumin excretion rates during pre-exercise rest (mean +/- SD; E: 6.2 +/- 6.0; N: 7.1 +/- 8.0; P: 7.7 +/- 7.0 mg/mmol creatinine) and during exercise (E: 8.7 +/- 9.4; N: 8.2 +/- 8.2; P: 11.1 +/- 11.4 mg/mmol creatinine) were comparable between the drugs and not significantly different after administration of placebo. Blood pressure values were significantly different between the medications (systolic blood pressure: p = 0.0269; diastolic blood pressure: p = 0.0021, ANOVA for repeated measurements). There were no significant correlations between blood pressure values and albuminuria at any time. In normotensive patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy low-dose administration of enalapril, nitrendipine and placebo does not result in clear cut differences in albuminuria.",

The present patient was also treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril, and the combination of ACE-inhibition and potassium-sparing diuretics is known to induce hyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia was probably induced by the combination of ACE-inhibitor and trimethoprim, and this combination may be as dangerous as the combination of ACE-inhibitors with other potassium-sparing diuretics.", 
    "108": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to minimize fibrosis of the kidney tubulointerstitium in several diseases. In addition to lowering angiotensin II levels, ACE inhibitors can increase kinin levels and subsequently increase nitric oxide formation. To determine whether nitric oxide generation is a component of the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on renal fibrosis, enalapril, enalapril plus NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or L-arginine was administered to rats that had undergone unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Ureteral obstruction caused significant increases in interstitial volume, monocyte macrophage infiltration, interstitial collagen IV and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression, transforming growth factor-beta 1 mRNA, collagen IV mRNA, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 mRNA. Enalapril treatment significantly blunted the increase in all parameters during UUO. Cotreatment of the animals with enalapril and L-NAME reversed the beneficial effect of enalapril in the obstructed kidney for all parameters. Treatment of animals with UUO with L-arginine significantly blunted the increase in all parameters except for transforming growth factor-beta 1 mRNA expression. In the enalapril- plus-L-NAME-treated animals, there were modest but significant increases in monocyte/macrophage infiltration of the interstitium and glomerulus, and collagen IV and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in the interstitium of the contralateral unobstructed kidney. The urine nitrite concentration was significantly increased by either enalapril or L-arginine treatment, whereas L-NAME significantly reduced urine nitrite concentration. These results suggest that treatment modalities that increase nitric oxide formation have a beneficial effect on the progression of cellular and molecular parameters of tubulointerstitial fibrosis caused by obstruction of the ureter.", 
    "109": "The transgenic rat (TGR) (mRen-2)27 is said to have low circulating active renin values in plasma and little or no renin gene expression in the kidney. Nevertheless, intrarenal angiotensin II-related effects appear to be responsible for the rightward shift in pressure-natriuresis curves of TGR. To clarify the role of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system in modulating TGR pressure-natriuresis, TGR were given lifelong lisinopril by treating TGR and their mothers before conception. Rat and mouse renin, AT1 receptor, and angiotensinogen gene expression in the kidneys were studied with in situ hybridization. Neural and endocrine regulatory differences between TGR and Sprague-Dawley Hannover (SDH) rats were eliminated by renal denervation and infusion of vasopressin, aldosterone, 17-OH corticosterone, and norepinephrine. TGR with lisinopril had blood pressures similar to SDH. In TGR with lisinopril, the pressure-natriuresis curve was shifted leftward but not quite to the values observed in SDH given lisinopril. The histology of lisinopril-treated TGR was indistinguishable from normal SDH. Lisinopril increased rat renin and angiotensinogen gene expression both in SDH and TGR, but it did not influence mouse renin gene expression in TGR. Discontinuing lisinopril increased blood pressure in TGR and shifted the pressure-natriuresis relationship rightward. Thus, the components of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system and the mouse renin transgene were present and expressed in kidneys of TGR. The rat gene components responded to lisinopril as expected, but the mouse renin transgene expression was not influenced. Lisinopril normalized TGR blood pressure; however, a detectable leftward shift in pressure-natriuresis remained. These studies underscore the role of angiotensin-mediated effects of the mouse renin transgene in terms of shifting pressure-natriuresis in TGR.", 
    "110": "Glomerular filtration rate is often used to assess the level of renal function and the progression of renal disease. However, the short-term effects of dietary protein restriction, blood pressure reduction, and specific classes of antihypertensive agents on GFR may be opposite in direction from their observed long-term beneficial effects on the progression of renal disease. The purpose of these analyses was to characterize these short-term effects and determine whether they can obscure the relationship between renal structure and function in patients with slowly progressive renal disease. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study was a randomized trial of the effect of dietary protein restriction and strict blood pressure control on the decline in GFR in 840 patients with mean (range) baseline GFR of 36.1 (13 to 55) mL/min per 1.73 m2. In this study, comparisons of the randomized groups and correlational analyses were used to determine the short-term (4-month) effects on GFR of changes in protein intake, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and class of antihypertensive agents (computed as the reduction in GFR associated with starting versus stopping medications) during the first 4 months of follow-up and in subsequent 4-month intervals during the first 2 yr of follow-up. Combining results over the first 2 yr of follow-up, and controlling for changes in antihypertensive medications, the independent effect on GFR of changes in protein intake and MAP was 1.1 mL/min per 0.4 g/kg per day and 0.9 mL/min per 10 mm Hg, respectively (P < 0.001). These effects were observed in patients with increasing or decreasing protein intake or MAP, and in patients with stable or changing antihypertensive regimens. Starting treatment with diuretics, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a 4.4-, 3.2-, or 2.2-mL/min greater GFR decline, respectively, than was stopping this treatment (P < 0.001). The effect of changes in protein intake, MAP, and diuretics was greater in patients with higher initial GFR. After controlling for initial GFR, there were no significant differences between the short-term effects observed during the first 4 months of follow-up and the short-term effects during subsequent follow-up. Changes in protein intake, blood pressure, and antihypertensive agents have small but statistically significant short-term effects on GFR. These effects can lead to clinically significant changes in renal function in patients undergoing multiple interventions and are large enough to confound the results of clinical trials in patients with slowly progressive renal disease. Future studies using GFR to assess the progression of renal disease should take into account these short-term effects when the length of follow-up is being planned.", 
    "111": "Experimental studies indicate that Angll is involved in the process of tissue destruction in chronic renal diseases. This notion has been verified in a number of small-to large-scale clinical studies using angiotensin (ANG) I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). Although the repertoire of the pathophysiologic cascade underlying the progressive destruction of renal tissue has continued to expand over recent years, from proteinuria and physical forces to growth factors and metalloproteinase disregulations, studies now suggest that Angll is involved in many, if not all, of these processes. Because these expanded pathophysiologic potentials of Angll are based primarily on observations in vitro, their significance in vivo, and in humans in particular, needs to be established. Recent studies in animals and humans indicate that the role of Angll in renal tissue destruction is subject to the modulation of multiple environmental and genetic factors, such as dietary habit and ACE genotype. Further delineation of the role of Angll in this respect for specific renal diseases and patients will enable us to design an efficient therapeutic intervention for this otherwise most complex problem of today's nephrology.",

The in vitro incubation of BK and [des-Arg9]BK in the serum of four species with or without enalaprilat and the quantification of the immunoreactivity of both peptides at different time intervals allowed the measurement of the kinetic parameters characterizing their metabolic pathways. Highly sensitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays were used to measure the residual concentrations of BK and [des-Arg9]BK. Half-life (t1/2) of BK showed significant difference among species: rats (10 +/- 1 s) = dogs (13 +/- 1 s) < rabbits (31 +/- 1 s) < humans (49 +/- 2 s). t1/2 values of [des-Arg9]BK were also species dependent: rats (96 +/- 6 s) < < rabbits (314 +/- 6 s) = dogs (323 +/- 11 s) = humans (325 +/- 12 s). Enalaprilat significantly prevented the rapid BK and [des-Arg9]BK degradation in all species except that of [des-Arg9]BK in rat serum. Relative amount of BK hydrolyzed by serum KII was given as follows: rabbits (93.7 +/- 14.8%) = rats (83.6 +/- 6.7%) = humans (76.0 +/- 7.5%) > dogs (50.0 +/- 3.9%). Its importance in the hydrolysis of [des-Arg9]BK was 5.2 +/- 0.5% in rats < < 33.9 +/- 1.5% in humans < 52.0 +/- 1.1% in rabbits < 65.1 +/- 3.4% in dogs. The participation of serum KI in the transformation of BK into [des-Arg9]BK was dogs (67.2 +/- 5.3%) > > humans (3.4 +/- 1.2%) = rabbits (1.8 +/- 0.2%) = rats (1.4 +/- 0.3%). Finally, no significant difference on t1/2 values for BK and [des-Arg9]BK could be demonstrated between serum and plasma treated with either sodium citrate or a thrombin inhibitor. These results revealed striking species differences in the serum metabolism of kinins that could address at least partially some of the controversial data related to the cardioprotective role of kinins.", 
    "120": "The purpose of this study was to investigate if enalapril could be administered with cyclosporin A (CyA) to reduce its nephrotoxicity. Sixty rats were divided into five groups: group I, Control group; group II, rat treated with oral enalapril; group III, rats treated with CyA: group IV, rats treated with CyA and enalapril; group V, rats treated with enalapril before the CyA therapy. At the end of the therapy mean serum creatinine concentrations were not statistically different between the groups (P > 0.05), in groups treated with CyA there were no statistically significant differences between mean CyA levels (P > 0.05), and mean blood urea nitrogen levels of the groups treated with CyA were significantly elevated (P < 0.05) compared with groups not treated with CyA. Morphologically acute CyA nephrotoxicity was evaluated by the following features: (1) tubular vacuolization, (2) tubular necrosis, (3) tubular microcalcification, and (4) peritubular capillary congestion. These lesions were scored semiquantitatively on a scale from 0 to 4+. The most common tubular pathology was tubular vacuolization, which was more severe in groups III and IV. Tubular necrosis was most severe in group III. In conclusion, enalapril seems to suppress the severest form of CyA nephrotoxicity, namely tubular necrosis, if administered prior to CyA treatment.", 
    "121": "The effect of enalapril on urinary protein excretion and renal function was studied in six paediatric patients with various renal diseases causing nephroticrange proteinuria. In three younger children (aged 7-9 years) with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, enalapril at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day given for 24 months yielded a temporary reduction of proteinuria in one child, a moderate and steady decrease in another and a complete disappearance of proteinuria in the third. Three adolescents, aged 17 years, took enalapril for 24 months at a dose of 20 mg/day. We observed no effect on proteiuria in one patient with Alport syndrome, a complete disappearance of urinary protein in one patient with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and a moderate decrease in the third patient who had idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Enalapril therapy resulted in an important reduction of proteinuria in two patients and a moderate decrease in three others. However this therapy was accompanied by a fall in glomerular filtration in all subjects, which was very marked in two patients. This fall in glomerular filtration may, however, simply reflect the natural course of the disease.", 
    "122": "We investigated the constrictor effects of Angiotensin I (Ang I) and Angiotensin II (Ang II) on rabbit peripheral (aorta, carotid artery, mesenteric artery, saphenous artery) and cerebral (basilar artery) vessels and in rat aorta in functional organ bath studies. The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril was also assessed in these preparations. Ang II elicited concentration-dependent contractions with comparable potency in rabbit and rat endothelium-free vascular rings (pD2 about 8.5) which indicates a lack of species and regional variation in the contractile responses to Ang II. The responses to Ang II were reduced by the presence of a functional endothelium in rabbit mesenteric artery and in rat aorta. Since ACE determines the plasma and tissue conversion of Ang I to active Ang II, we calculated the ratio R (EC50 Ang I-induced contraction: EC50 Ang II-induced contraction) as an indicator of the tissue ACE effectiveness. In the aorta without endothelium, Ang I was found to be much less potent than Ang II in the rabbit (R = 44) compared with the rat (R = 3.5). This species difference in the aortic conversion of Ang I to Ang II was confirmed by the use of captopril. Captopril (10(-6) M) shifted the Ang I concentration/ response curve by 2- and 14-fold to the right in rabbit and rat respectively. In other rabbit blood vessels, the rank order of potency to Ang I in endothelium denuded rings was basilar artery > > carotid artery > or = aorta > or = saphenous artery. In addition, the R value was the lowest for the basilar artery (R = 2.5). This is in agreement with the highest rightward shift (78-fold) of the Ang I concentration/response curve by captopril for basilar artery in comparison with only 3-, 8- and 3-fold shifts observed in carotid artery, saphenous artery and aorta respectively. In conclusion, our data provide evidence for a greater influence of ACE in rabbit basilar artery than in peripheral vessels.", 
    "123": "Hypertension results in increased thickness and stiffness of large artery walls. The goal of our study was to assess the respective roles of humoral factors such as Ang II, endothelin and blood pressure in these aortic modifications. For this purpose, uninephrectomized rats received DOCA and high salt diet, and when hypertension was installed, they were treated for 5 weeks with either a long-acting calcium antagonist, mibefradil (30 mg/kg/day), an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (3 mg/kg/day), or a mixed ETA and ETB endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan (100 mg/kg/day). A group of hypertensive rats was left untreated and a sham-operated group of normotensive rats was used for control. At the end of treatment, aortic medial thickness and elastin as well as collagen were evaluated by quantitative morphometry. DOCA-salt hypertensive rats exhibited a marked increase in medial thickness associated with no change in absolute content in extracellular matrix. Elastin relative density decreased in DOCA rats. Enalapril had no effect on arterial pressure. Bosentan decreased slightly (by 12 mm Hg), but not significantly, blood pressure. None of these drugs had an effect on medial thickness suggesting that in DOCA hypertensive rats neither Ang II nor endothelin play a significant role in the remodeling of the aorta. In contrast, mibefradil almost normalized arterial pressure, prevented medial hypertrophy and increased elastin density. Further studies are required in order to assess if this effect is directly linked to the blood pressure decrease or to another mechanism related to the calcium antagonistic property of mibefradil.", 
    "124": "Despite having lower levels of plasma renin activity than younger individuals, elderly patients with hypertension respond well to ACE inhibitors and the drugs have few adverse effects. Plasma concentrations of the active ACE inhibitor are generally higher in the elderly because of decreased renal clearance. These altered pharmacokinetics, combined with impairment of cardiovascular reflexes and the increasing prevalence of heart failure and renal impairment with age, render elderly patients more susceptible to first-dose hypotension. Although many studies have shown that standard dosages are well tolerated it is safer to use lower initial dosages of ACE inhibitors in elderly hypertensive patients because hypotensive reactions are not always predictable. The maintenance dosage may be determined more by the presence of renal disease or heart failure than by age per se. In elderly patients with heart failure, ACE inhibitors should be introduced even more cautiously, using low dosages and preferably under supervision. It may also be necessary to interrupt diuretic treatment for a few days to prevent severe hypotension. The ACE inhibitor dosage should then be titrated up to the maximum that is well tolerated, as this appears to offer the greatest benefit.", 
    "125": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has two enzymatically active domains: a C-domain in the carboxy terminal region and an N-domain in the amino terminal region. We based the pharmacologic characterization of these sites on the rat testis-lung model. In testis, only a truncate form of ACE is present (C-site), whereas both N- and C-sites are present in lung. In this model, captopril was shown to be N-selective and delaprilat to be C-selective. Ro 31-8472, a cilazapril derivative, and enalaprilat proved to be not site selective. We used these drugs to evaluate the affinity of C and N sites in various human tissues involved in the cardiovascular actions of ACE and used [125I]Ro31-8472 as ligand. The number and affinity of ACE binding sites were 17,680 +/- 2,345 fmol/mg protein (Kd = 0.32 +/- 0.04 nM) in lung, 560 +/- 65 (Kd = 0.36 +/- 0.05 nM) in heart, 237 +/- 51 (Kd = 0.37 +/- 0.06 nM) in coronary artery, 236 +/- 63 (Kd = 0.14 +/- 0.05 nM) in saphenous vein, and 603 +/- 121 (Kd = 0.50 +/- 0.06 nM) in mammary artery. The affinity (pKi) of captopril for the N sites ranged from 9.40 +/- 0.14 (lung) to 8.41 +/- 0.10 (coronary artery). The affinity for the C-site by delaprilat ranged from 9.97 +/- 0.15 (coronary artery) to 9.10 +/- 0.14 (mammary artery). Therefore, the affinity of C- and N-sites of ACE for ACE inhibitor (ACEI) drugs is different according to the organ involved. Because ACE is a glycosylated enzyme and glycosylation is organ dependent, we suggest that organ-specific glycosylation affects the binding characteristics of ACE inhibitors to N- or C-site of human tissular ACE.", 
    "126": "Following establishment of its efficacy in hypertension and congestive heart failure, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril has now been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction when administered as early treatment. The ability of lisinopril to attenuate the detrimental effects of left ventricular remodelling is a key mechanism; however, additional cardioprotective and vasculoprotective actions are postulated to play a role in mediating the early benefit. The GISSI-3 trial in > 19 000 patients has demonstrated that, when given orally within 24 hours of symptom onset and continued for 6 weeks, lisinopril (with or without nitrates) produces measurable survival benefits within 1 to 2 days of starting treatment. Compared with no lisinopril treatment, reductions of 11% in risk of mortality and 7.7% in a combined end-point (death plus severe left ventricular dysfunction) were evident at 6 weeks. Advantages were apparent in all types of patients. Thus, those at high risk-women, the elderly, patients with diabetes mellitus and those with anterior infarct and/or Killip class > 1 -also benefited. These gains in combined end-point events persisted in the longer term, despite treatment withdrawal after 6 weeks in most patients. At 6 months, the incidence rate for the combined end-point remained lower than with control (a 6.2% reduction). The GISSI-3 results concur with those from recent large investigations (ISIS-4, CCS-1, SMILE) of other ACE inhibitors as early management in myocardial infarction. However, the results of the CONSENSUS II trial (using intravenous enalaprilat then oral enalapril) were unfavourable in some patients. These findings, together with the development of persistent hypotension and, to a lesser extent, renal dysfunction among patients in the GISSI-3 trial, have prompted considerable debate over optimum treatment strategies. Present opinion generally holds that therapy with lisinopril or other ACE inhibitors shown to be beneficial may be started within 24 hours in haemodynamically stable patients with no other contraindications; current labelling in the US and other countries reflects this position. There is virtually unanimous agreement that such therapy is indicated in high-risk patients, particularly those with left ventricular dysfunction. The choice of ACE inhibitor appears less important than the decision to treat; it seems likely that these benefits are a class effect. Lisinopril has a tolerability profile resembling that of other ACE inhibitors, can be given once daily and may be less costly than other members of its class. However, present cost analyses are flawed and this latter points remains to be proven in formal cost-effectiveness analyses. In conclusion, early treatment with lisinopril (within 24 hours of symptom onset) for 6 weeks improves survival and reduces cardiovascular morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction, and confers ongoing benefit after drug withdrawal. While patients with symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction are prime candidates for treatment, all those who are haemodynamically stable with no other contraindications are also eligible to receive therapy. Lisinopril and other ACE inhibitors shown to be beneficial should therefore be considered an integral part of the early management of myocardial infarction in suitable patients.", 
    "127": "Myocarditis is a poorly understood condition and its prevalence is largely underestimated. A significant proportion of cases may be subclinical and chronic, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy, which represents the first cause of heart transplantation worldwide. Although inflammation of the myocardium can be associated with various causes, particularly viruses, myocarditis is usually idiopathic. Present evidence suggests that some 'idiopathic' and chronic 'postviral' myocarditis cases may be autoimmune, whereas others with acute self-limited disease or with persisting pathogenic virus by molecular methods may represent viral myocarditis. The major obstacle in identifying a specific therapy in myocarditis lies in the difficulty of a thorough clinical characterisation of individual patients in relation to viral and autoimmune involvement. This also explains the inconclusive results of trials of immunosuppressive drugs in myocarditis/dilated cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is based upon endomyocardial biopsy. Management of myocarditis requires avoidance of agents that exacerbate myocarditis or depress myocardial function, and conventional therapy for heart failure (diuretics, ACE inhibitors and, if indicated, digoxin) and arrhythmias. Although at present the use of immunosuppressive therapy cannot be recommended on a routine basis, the recent Myocarditis Treatment Trial, where an aetiologically heterogeneous patient population was treated without significant adverse effects, provides some rationale for applying the same immunosuppression protocol to selected patients, e.g. those with active biopsy-proven myocarditis, unresponsive to conventional therapy, prior to transplantation, and those with idiopathic giant cell myocarditis.", 
    "128": "The results of a recent clinical trial. The Effect of ACE inhibition on Diabetic Nephropathy, demonstrated that captopril reduced the rate of renal failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and death in patients with IDDM and nephropathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of captopril as a therapy in patients with IDDM as well as the potential savings for all patients with diabetes and nephropathy.", 
    "129": "We used the results from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing captopril (207 patients) with placebo (202 patients), whose purpose was to determine whether captopril has kidney-protecting properties independent of its effect on blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy to develop a model of medical treatment for patients before progression to ESRD. To model the course of illness after progression to ESRD and to extend the model to patients with NIDDM, we used data from the U.S. Renal Data System and published literature. Medical resource cost data were based predominantly upon Medicare reimbursement levels, published wholesale drug prices, and surveying health care providers. The economic model uses a payer perspective to estimate direct cost. The cost to society (indirect cost) associated with lost patient productivity due to ESRD was also estimated. Using this information, we predicted the costs incurred annually and over a lifetime if patients with IDDM and NIDDM and overt nephropathy were treated with either placebo or captopril. We also constructed a model of the overall prevalence of diabetic nephropathy to estimate the aggregate savings in total U.S. health care expenditures.", 
    "130": "Treatment with captopril resulted in an absolute direct cost savings or benefit of $32,550 per patient with IDDM over the course of a lifetime compared to treatment with placebo. For patients with NIDDM, the direct cost savings totaled $9,900 per patient. Absolute savings were found for indirect costs as well: $84,390 per patient with IDDM and $45,730 per patient with NIDDM. If captopril therapy were initiated in 1995 for patients with either IDDM or NIDDM and nephropathy, the aggregate health care cost savings (i.e. direct cost savings alone) would be $189 million a year for the year 1999 and $475 million a year in 2004, the present value of cumulative health care cost savings for these 10 years would be $2.4 billion.",

    "132": "Adult male rats (n = 5-7 per group) were water deprived for 24 h with only food available. Then they had access to water for 2 h. At the end of the 2 h, 1.5% NaCl was offered to the animals and the intake was measured for another 2 h. The rats drank an average of 9.8 +/- 3.0 ml/120 min of 1.5% NaCl; water intake during this time was negligible (not more than 1.0 ml/120 min). Captopril injected i.p. at the doses of 12 and 24 mg/ kg induced 60-90% inhibition of the intake. Losartan or PD123319 injected i.c.v. induced 50-80% inhibition of the intake. Losartan (80 nmol) inhibited the intake at a lower dose than PD123319 (160 nmol). Neither losartan nor PD123319 inhibited 10% sucrose intake. The inhibition of 1.5% NaCl intake was not related to alterations in arterial pressure. The results show that the antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system inhibits the 1.5% NaCl intake induced by water deprivation. The inhibition induced by the angiotensin II antagonists suggest that this peptide is important for the control of salt intake induced by water deprivation.", 
    "133": "Diabetic nephropathy is the most frequent cause of chronic renal failure. The onset of microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes mellitus, which seems to be related to blood pressure and the control of glycemia, is predictive of the development of true proteinuria. This multicenter, single-blind, randomized study examined the effects of benazepril and nicardipine on overnight microalbuminuria in 57 normotensive and 46 hypertensive diabetic patients. At the end of a 3-month placebo run-in period, the patients were stratified on the basis of the presence or absence of arterial hypertension and, within each stratum, randomized to receive one daily tablet of 10 mg benazepril or one tablet of 20 mg nicardipine twice daily for 6 months. Renal hemodynamics was investigated in 25 patients. Both drugs decreased overnight microalbuminuria throughout the study period, but benazepril was more effective than nicardipine (p = 0.025); in the patients with hypertension, both drugs led to a similar marked reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This study shows that benazepril was more effective than nicardipine in reducing overnight microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes mellitus, independently of their antihypertensive properties.",

In hand veins preconstricted with the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine, substance P and antagonists of nitric oxide formation (L-NG-mono-methyl-arginine, L-NMMA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent potassium channels (glyburide), angiotensin converting enzyme (enalaprilat), and cyclooxygenase (acetylsalicylic acid) were infused and the venodilator effect was measured.", 
    "136": "Substance P proved to be the most potent venodilator known thus far (the dose-rate exerting 50% of mean maximum dilation [ED50], geometric mean: 0.105 pmol/min). Rapid development of tolerance occurred in seven of eight volunteers studied. Glyburide decreased the venodilator action of a single dose of substance P (1.5 pmol/min) from 81% to 28% of baseline venodilation (p < 0.05), suggesting that substance P acts through release of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. The cyclooxygenase-inhibitor acetylsalicylic acid reduced substance P-induced venodilation from 53% +/- 7% to 34% +/- 8% (p < 0.05), whereas L-NMMA had no effect.", 
    "137": "Unlike in other vessels, substance P-induced venodilation in hand veins is not mediated through nitric oxide but to a significant extent through a glyburide-sensitive pathway. Therefore it appears likely that substance P activates ATP-dependent potassium channels on vascular smooth muscle cells through the release of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor.", 
    "138": "Thirteen patients with mild hypertension (untreated diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 114 mmHg) received, in random order, three successive treatments of four weeks with placebo, spirapril (6 mg daily), or hydrochlorothiazide (HCT2) (24 mg daily). At the end of each treatment, blood samples for assessment of platelet aggregation and platelet release of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and for assessment of fibrinolysis, estimated by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-type 1 (PAI-1), and euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT), were taken, first at rest, then immediately after five to ten minutes of vigorous exercise, and finally after the subsequent hour of recovery rest. Platelet aggregation induced in vitro by adrenaline significantly decreased during treatment with HCT2, the threshold rising to 10 microM as compared with 1.0 with placebo (P < 0.05) at rest, and the threshold for adenosine diphosphate (ADP) aggregation also rose, from 2 microM to 4 (NS). The resting plasma PF4 value fell, although not significantly, during HCT2 treatment from the placebo value of 3.28 to 2.56 ng/mL. During spirapril treatment there was no change in the threshold of either adrenaline or ADP for aggregation of platelets sampled at rest, and the PF4 plasma levels showed no significant reductions at rest. However, during exercise PF4 showed an approximate doubling of the resting value irrespective of therapy. This exercise-induced increase in PF4 was significantly reduced by spirapril as compared with placebo (P < 0.05). ECLT and t-PA did not shift significantly from the placebo level during either therapy. PAI-1 did not change during spirapril therapy, but during HCT2 treatment it fell, although not significantly, to 9.36 IU/mL from 15.91 with placebo (NS). Spirapril and HCT2 did not produce any unwanted side effect on platelet function or fibrinolysis. HCT2 seems to decrease platelet activity at rest, whereas spirapril seems to some extent to decrease platelet activity at exercise.",

When the infusions were stopped, symptoms quickly abated without treatment. Multiple prior transfusions of unfiltered FFP and FFP filtered through a WBC-reduction filter made by a different manufacturer, as well as subsequent transfusions of unfiltered FFP, had not produced such reactions.",

Pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril resulted in bilateral and symmetrical renal abnormalities (increase of parenchymal transit time, time to maximum activity and retained cortical activity, with cortical trapping of the radiopharmaceutical). Baseline scintigraphy was normal. The findings are consistent with Bartter's syndrome pathogenesis.

Only small stenotic and small kidneys with normal renal arteries showed a significant reduced baseline RBF as compared with normal kidneys (both p < 0.05); this difference disappeared after ACE-inhibition only for the small kidneys with normal renal arteries. In patients with stenosed kidneys, RBF tended to be reduced both at baseline and after captopril, but the differences with normal kidneys were not statistically significant.

The effect of angiotensin II (AngII) on the activity of Na,K-ATPase in retinas from normal rats was also studied in vitro. AngII significantly lowered the activities of total Na,K-ATPase (-16%) and its alpha 1 and alpha 3 isozymes. The inhibitory effect of AngII was abolished completely by losartan (0.1 microM), a specific antagonist of the AT1 receptor-subtype of AngII, and by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (50 microM), which at this concentration inhibits the lipoxygenase and cytochrome P-450-dependent pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism. The inhibitory effect of AngII on the Na,K-ATPase activity was not altered significantly by NG-iminoethyl ornithine (10 microM), an irreversible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.",

Although AngII inhibits retinal Na,K-ATPase by a mechanism possibly involving arachidonic acid metabolites, it is unlikely that AngII contributes to the decreased Na,K-ATPase activity because of its reduced formation by retinal ACE in diabetes. The possible importance of reduced retinal ACE activity in diabetes warrants further investigation.",

Perindopril reduced blood pressure and native left ventricular weight and also caused a significant decrease in the weight of the transplanted left ventricle compared with controls. Hoe 140 did not significantly alter blood pressure or native left ventricular weight of perindopril-treated rats but caused a significant increase in the weight of the transplanted left ventricle compared with rats treated with perindopril alone. Angiotensin treatment resulted in a significant increase in blood pressure and native left ventricular weight but no significant change in the weight of the transplanted left ventricle. Blood pressure and left ventricular weight for native but not for transplanted hearts were positively correlated. Therefore, in the absence of mechanical load, the weight of the left ventricle of spontaneously hypertensive rats responds little to angiotensin II but can be reduced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The effect of perindopril on transplanted hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats appears to depend on bradykinin.", 
    "157": "Abnormalities of the arterial pulse waveform reflect changes in cardiovascular structure and function. These abnormalities may occur early in the course of essential hypertension, even before the onset of blood pressure elevation. Previous studies of cardiovascular structure and function have relied on invasive intra-arterial cannulation to obtain the arterial pulse wave. We evaluated arterial structure and function using a noninvasive cuff sphygmomanometer in hypertensive (n = 15) and normotensive (n = 36) subjects stratified by genetic risk (family history) for hypertension. Using a simple physical model in which the aorta was assumed to be a T tube and the brachial artery a straight tube, we determined vascular compliance and peripheral resistance by analyzing the brachial artery pulsation signal from a cuff sphygmomanometer. Essential hypertensive subjects tended to have higher peripheral resistance (P = .06) and significantly lower vascular compliance (P = .001) than normotensive subjects. Vascular compliance correlated with simultaneously determined pulse pressure in both groups (n = 51, r = .74, P < .0001). Higher peripheral resistance (P = .07) and lower vascular compliance (P = .04) were already found in still-normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents (ie, normotensive subjects with a positive family history of hypertension) than in normotensive subjects with a negative family history of hypertension. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that both genetic risk for hypertension (P = .030) and blood pressure status (P = .041), although not age (P = .207), were significant predictors of vascular compliance (multiple R = .47, P = .011). However, by two-way ANOVA, genetic risk for hypertension was an even more significant determinant (F = 7.84, P = .007) of compliance than blood pressure status (F = 2.69, P = .089). Antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (10 days, n = 10) improved vascular compliance (P = .02) and reduced resistance (P = .003) significantly; treatment with calcium channel antagonists (4 weeks, n = 8) tended to improve vascular compliance (P = .07) and significantly reduced peripheral resistance (P = .006). We conclude that arterial vascular compliance abnormalities detected by a noninvasive cuff sphygmomanometer reflect treatment-reversible changes in vascular structure and function. Early changes in vascular compliance in still-normotensive individuals at genetic risk for hypertension may be a heritable pathogenetic feature of this disorder.", 
    "158": "Compaction of extracellular matrix (ECM) lattices by cultured fibroblasts was accelerated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The rate of acceleration was significantly related to the clinical grade of vasospasm. However, the mechanism remains unclear. Evidence exists for an important role in cerebral vasospasm for protein kinase C (PKC). The purpose of this study was to help clarify whether PKC has a role in contraction of the ECM.", 
    "159": "We studied the effects of a myristoylated PKC peptide inhibitor (Myr-Arg-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln-Lys-Asn-Val) (PKC peptide inhibitor), (5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine (HA-1077) (inhibitor of protein kinase A, myosin light-chain kinase, and protein kinase G), 7-deacetyl-6-(N-ace-tylglycyl)-forskolin (forskolin) (adenyl cyclase activator), and diacylglycerol-lactone (DAG-lactone) (PKC activator) on fibroblast-populated collagen lattice compaction with or without CSF from SAH patients. Four sets of fibroblasts were used: three explanted from skin and one from cerebral artery.",

Low concentration of PKC peptide inhibitor enhanced acceleration by CSF but had no effects without CSF. HA-1077 could not inhibit lattice compaction. Forskolin inhibited compaction. DAG-lactone accelerated compaction in early phases.", 
    "161": "In the mechanism of acceleration of contraction of ECM under the influence of CSF, PKC seems to have two different roles. Protein kinase A and myosin light-chain kinase apparently play more minor roles than PKC in the mechanism, but no evidence was found of a role for protein kinase G activation in matrix compaction.", 
    "162": "The circulating and urinary bladder tissue concentrations of angiotensin I (ANG I) and angiotensin II [ANG-(1-8)] were examined in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley male rats given an intravenous bolus infusion of either ANG I, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enalaprilat or ramiprilat, or saline. The mean concentrations of ANG I and ANG-(1-8) were markedly higher in the urinary bladder tissue than in whole blood. There was a significant increase in the concentration of ANG I and ANG-(1-8), both in the urinary bladder tissue and the circulation, after the ANG I infusion. Both ACE inhibitors were associated with an increase in the concentration of whole blood ANG I; however, tissue ANG I levels were significantly increased only following ACE inhibition with ramiprilat but not with enalaprilat. Both plasma and urinary bladder tissue ANG-(1-8) levels decreased significantly following ACE inhibition, but only with ramiprilat. The elevated urinary bladder tissue levels of ANG I and ANG-(1-8) at baseline, compared with circulating levels, and the maintenance of ANG-(1-8) in bladder tissue in the face of inhibition of the circulatory renin-angiotensin system with enalaprilat support the presence of an autocrine/paracrine renin-angiotensin system in the urinary bladder. Under the current experimental conditions, ramiprilat appears to have enhanced bladder activity compared with enalaprilat.", 
    "163": "Exacerbation of anemia associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy has been noted to occur in patients with chronic renal failure, end-stage renal disease, and renal transplantation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to cause anemia through induction of decreased red blood cell production. There are data suggesting that ACE inhibitors may impair erythropoiesis via either suppression of angiotensin-mediated erythropoietin (EPO) production or bone marrow response to EPO. Patients on chronic hemodialysis receive recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) for therapy of anemia and may also receive an ACE inhibitor for hypertension or congestive heart failure. We undertook a retrospective study to evaluate whether patients treated with ACE inhibitors developed a more severe anemia or required a higher dose of rHuEPO to maintain a similar hematocrit. Ninety-five of 108 chronic hemodialysis patients met study criteria (hemodialysis for 4 months and no treatment with an ACE inhibitor for at least 4 months = group 1; therapy with an ACE inhibitor for at least 4 months = group 2). Forty-eight patients (group 1, n = 24; group 2, n = 24) were available for analysis after exclusion for a variety of factors. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of baseline characteristics, number of blood transfusions or hospital days, or other laboratory parameters. There was no statistically significant difference in average hematocrit between group 1 (33.5% +/- 3.9%) and group 2 (32.6% +/- 1.6%). Similarly, no significant difference was observed for the average rHuEPO dose/treatment between group 1 (3,272 +/- 1,532 IU/treatment; 50.69 +/- 26.94 IU/kg/treatment) and group 2 (3,401 +/- 1,009 IU/treatment; 52.87 +/- 19.38 IU/kg/treatment). These results suggest that ACE inhibitors do not significantly induce more severe anemia or alter rHuEPO response in chronic hemodialysis patients.", 
    "164": "ACE inhibitors improve reperfusion function in several animal models. We tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibitor-induced coronary protection and inhibition of reperfusion arrhythmias are mediated by suppression of cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) secretion and action.", 
    "165": "The effects of two ACE inhibitors on ET-1 secretion and mechanical function during ischemia and reperfusion were studied in perfused rat hearts. Drugs were infused during the control (60 minutes), ischemic (60 minutes), and reperfusion (30 minutes) period. ET-1 appearing in coronary effluents and the interstitium was analyzed by radioimmunoassay. We observed (1) in hearts treated with ramiprilat (100 nmol/L) or captopril (5 mumol/L), a significant reduction of ET-1 secretion under all three experimental conditions and fewer ventricular extrasystoles during reperfusion; (2) increased ET-1 secretion and numerous tachyarrhythmic events in the presence of ACE inhibitor and a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant (100 nmol/L); (3) an almost-complete suppression of reperfusion arrhythmias when an ET receptor antagonist, ie, SB 209670 (5 mumol/L) or PD 142893 (200 nmol/L), was infused together with ACE inhibitor and icatibant; and (4) SB 209670 alone to be equally antiarrhythmic as ACE inhibitors. Exogenous ET-1 (40 pmol/L) was proarrhythmic, whereas exogenous bradykinin (100 nmol/L) reduced ET-1 secretion and improved cardiac rhythm.", 
    "166": "ACE inhibitors suppress endogenous ET-1 secretion, which results in improved coronary function and stabilization of cardiac rhythm after ischemia in this model. Suppression of ET-1 results from both removal of endogenous angiotensin II and accumulation of endogenous bradykinin/nitric oxide. ET receptor antagonists may be prime antiarrhythmic drugs worthy of testing in cardiac patients, either alone or together with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "167": "Digoxin has been a controversial drug since its introduction >200 years ago. Although its efficacy in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation is clear, its value in patients with heart failure and sinus rhythm has often been questioned. In the 1980s, reports of some large-scale trials indicated that digoxin, with or without vasodilators or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, reduced signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure and improved exercise tolerance. This beneficial influence was mainly found in patients with more advanced heart failure and dilated ventricles, whereas the effect in those with mild disease appeared to be less pronounced. In the last few years, new data have shown that digoxin may also have clinical value in mild heart failure, either when used in combination with other drugs or when administered alone. As neurohumoral activation has increasingly been recognized to be a contributing factor in the disease progression of chronic heart failure, the modulating effects of digoxin on neurohumoral and autonomic status have received more attention. Also, there is evidence that relatively low doses of digoxin may be at least as effective as higher doses and have a lower incidence of side effects. Further, the recognition that the use of digoxin too early after myocardial infarction may be harmful and the development of other drugs, in particular angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have obviously changed the place of digoxin in the treatment of chronic heart failure. The large-scale survival trial by the Digitalis Investigators Group (DIG), whose preliminary results have recently been presented, has shown that although digoxin has a neutral effect on total mortality during long-term treatment, it reduces the number of hospital admissions and deaths due to worsening heart failure. The potentially new features of the old drug digoxin are discussed in this review.", 
    "168": "In addition to its vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-stimulating action, angiotensin II also drives cell growth and replication in the cardiovascular system, which may result in myocardial hypertrophy and hypertrophy or hyperplasia of conduit and resistance vessels in certain subjects. These actions are mediated through angiotensin II receptors (subtype AT1), which activate the G protein, phospholipase C, diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate pathway, to increase the expression of certain protooncogenes (c-fos, c-myc and c-jun) and growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor-A-chain, transforming growth factor-beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor). The cellular responses to angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle have been shown in different hypertensive vessels to be either hypertrophy alone, hypertrophy and DNA synthesis without cell division (polyploidy) or DNA synthesis with cell division (hyperplasia). In genetic hypertension, the altered structure of small arteries is due to either cellular hyperplasia or remodeling, whereas in renovascular hypertension there is hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin II also increases synthesis of some matrix components, activates blood monocytes and is thrombogenic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent or reverse vascular hypertrophy in animal models of hypertension; this seems to be a class effect, shared to some extent with calcium channel blocking agents. In human hypertension, ACE inhibitors reduce the increased media/lumen ratio of large and small arteries in hypertension and increase arterial compliance. These properties are also shared by losartan, the first of the new class of angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonists. The clinical implications of these findings need to be tested through rigorous and prospective clinical trials.", 
    "169": "The old paradigm states that the greater the stenosis, the greater the risk of cardiac events. Revascularization procedures are the only effective approach to improving prognosis associated with coronary artery disease. In contrast, on the basis of the new paradigm, the nature of the plaque determines the risk of acute cardiovascular events. Dangerous plaques have a lipid-rich core with surrounding inflammation and a thin friable overlying fibrous cap, but they usually appear innocuous on angiography. Effective risk factor modification stabilizes the dangerous plaques and is associated with prompt improvement in endothelial dysfunction and a substantial decrease in the risk of acute cardiovascular events and death.", 
    "170": "Hypertension has been defined and treated as a disease of abnormal systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Recent data have, however, demonstrated that effective blood-pressure control has not resulted in the expected decrease in coronary artery disease. These findings are probably a result of hypertension being a complex inherited syndrome of cardiovascular risk factors, all of which are genetically linked and all of which contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in these patients. Included in the hypertension syndrome are abnormalities of lipid profile, insulin resistance, changes in renal function, left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced arterial compliance. In many patients, high blood pressure is a late manifestation of this disease process. Since all cardiovascular risk factors contribute to heart disease in these patients, they should all be considered in the management of this disease process. Diuretics and beta blockers, when used at high doses, negatively impact lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity, while angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists tend to have a neutral effect on these metabolic risk factors. These findings have resulted in decreased use of diuretics and beta blockers in favor of newer agents such as ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists. However, recent data have demonstrated that when used at low doses (6.25 or 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide), diuretics lack significant metabolic side effects while bringing about significant reductions in blood pressure. Thus, at these doses, hydrochlorothiazide is a useful drug in the treatment of hypertension, both as monotherapy and in combination therapy.", 
    "171": "Diuretic monotherapy has been recommended by the fifth report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-V) as a preferred initial treatment for hypertension. Thiazide diuretics are commonly used to treat hypertension because of their demonstrated efficacy, favorable safety profile, low acquisition cost, and their proven ability to reduce blood pressure-related morbidity and mortality. Once-daily low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/ day) or chlorthalidone (15 mg/day) effectively reduces blood pressure in patients with stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension in comparison with placebo. Blood pressure reductions with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone are comparable to that achieved with higher doses (25 and 50 mg/day). Additional blood pressure reductions can be attained with concomitant use of once-daily low-dose hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a beta blocker, or a calcium antagonist. Once-daily low-dose hydrochlorothiazide provides clinically meaningful blood pressure lowering while minimizing adverse effects, such as electrolyte disturbances, cholesterol elevations, and increases in serum uric acid levels.", 
    "172": "Obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension are common and interrelated medical problems in Westernized, industrialized societies. These medical conditions are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and are more prevalent among minorities, such as African-American and Hispanic populations. The associated cardiovascular risks of these problems are more thoroughly addressed in another review in this supplement. Obesity markedly enhances the development of type II diabetes. Moreover, it enhances the cardiovascular risk associated with other risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Weight reduction in association with an aerobic exercise program improves metabolic abnormalities and reduces blood pressure in individuals with diabetes and hypertension. Frequently, however, pharmacologic treatment is required to lower blood pressure. Individual therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is preferred initially in these individuals, with the addition of either a low dose diuretic or a nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist if additional blood pressure reduction is required. These additive agents are recommended, since each has been shown individually to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and to preserve renal function among diabetic patients. Other issues, such as aggressive therapy of lipids and adequate glycemic control, are also important strategies for reducing cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality in this very high-risk population.", 
    "173": "The aim of this review is to assess the prevalence of complications and responses to various antihypertensive drug therapies in ethnic minority groups in the United States. In some instances, these comments are extended to responses of citizens in their countries of origin. The incidence of hypertension, mortality from hypertensive heart disease, stroke, and hypertensive renal disease are higher in African Americans. Although some Hispanic Americans have a lesser risk for hypertension, they have a greater risk for other risk factors such as diabetes and dyslipidemia. There is a similar association between income and mortality for both African Americans and Hispanic Americans. When compared to European Americans and other ethnic minorities, African Americans respond less favorably to beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Nevertheless, the observed response in African Americans to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers is clinically significant. The available literature indicates that Asian American responses to calcium antagonists seem to be more favorable than responses to ACE inhibitors and equivalent to their responses to diuretic and beta blocker therapy. Although there are few published studies of drug efficacy in Hispanic Americans, there appears to be no hierarchy in response to the various antihypertensive drug classes. Ethnicity is not an accurate criterion for predicting poor response to any class of antihypertensive therapy. Thus, there is little justification to use racial profiling as a criterion for the avoidance of selected drug classes because of presumed lack of efficacy. Observed differences in the incidence of hypertension and its poor outcomes have led some investigators to postulate that the etiology of hypertension in ethnic minority groups is intrinsically different from whites. Awareness of racial differences in hypertension outcomes evolved in the United States within a historical context that does not fully appreciate that race is often a surrogate for many social and economic factors that influence health status and healthcare delivery. Poor outcomes in ethnic minority groups occur in many diseases, not only hypertension. The goal of ethnicity-related research should be to describe the diversity of disease expression in humans and to target at-risk groups for prevention and early intervention. The use of racial descriptors to explain genetic differences in ethnic groups should take a lesser priority.", 
    "174": "The effect of moguisteine, a novel peripherally acting non-narcotic antitussive drug, on coughs associated with enalapril was examined in guinea-pigs. Chronic treatment with enalapril markedly enhanced the number of capsaicin-induced coughs. Moguisteine dose-dependently suppressed the number of coughs at doses between 3-30 mg/kg p.o., in both vehicle-treated and enalapril-treated animals. There was no significant difference in the antitussive ED50 (95% confidence limit) value of moguisteine between vehicle-treated (16.4 (13.7-19.7) mg/kg) and enalapril-treated (13.7 (3.9-47.6) mg/kg) animals. On the other hand, dihydrocodeine also dose-dependently suppressed the number of coughs in the same dose range as moguisteine in both vehicle-treated and enalapril-treated animals. There was no significant difference in the antitussive ED50 (95% confidence limit) of dihydrocodeine between vehicle-treated (11.7 (4.9-28.3) mg/kg) and enalapril-treated (11.2 (9.4-13.3) mg/kg) animals. Furthermore, the antitussive effect of moguisteine was identical to that of dihydrocodeine in both vehicle-treated and enalapril-treated animals. On the other hand, while chronic co-treatment with moguisteine significantly reduced the number of enhanced coughs associated with enalapril, chronic co-treatment with dihydrocodeine had no significant effect on the number of enhanced coughs associated with enalapril treatment. These results suggest that moguisteine may have a therapeutical benefit in reducing the coughing associated with treatment with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "175": "Angiotensin II receptor antagonists represent a new class of drugs that provide a site-specific blockade of the effects of angiotensin II. Losartan potassium, the first compound of this drug class, has recently become available in the United States. The clinical experience with angiotensin II receptor antagonists has demonstrated that these drugs are safe and efficacious for the treatment of hypertension and, possibly, congestive heart failure. Unlike with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the incidence of cough observed with angiotensin receptor antagonists is similar to that with placebo. Although several angiotensin receptors have been characterized, the effects of losartan and other angiotensin receptor antagonists under development are selective for the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists do not inhibit bradykinin metabolism or enhance prostaglandin synthesis. The antihypertensive efficacy of the angiotensin receptor antagonists has been documented to be similar to that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If the findings of clinical studies corroborate the initial reports on efficacy and safety, it seems likely that the angiotensin receptor antagonists will be added to the list of drugs that have been deemed suitable for first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "176": "Recent experimental data suggest marked similarities between the effects of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia on the arterial intima. Both conditions also seem to exert proinflammatory effects on the artery, resulting in the recruitment of monocytes into the intima. These effects may be due to production of oxygen-free radicals, which in turn may stimulate genes involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the arterial wall. Plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction are related to local accumulation of inflammatory cells in vulnerable areas of the plaque. Recent clinical trials using cholesterol-lowering or antihypertensive therapies have shown a decrease in cardiovascular events that may have resulted from withdrawal of inflammatory effects on the arterial wall. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors decrease the rate of myocardial infarction in patients with overt congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. These drugs probably affect several mechanisms related to the inhibition of angiotensin production and the potentiation of bradykinin and resultant enhancement of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. The mechanisms could include reversing the proinflammatory effects of angiotensin and hypercholesterolemia on the arterial wall. Future therapeutic strategies of vascular protection in hypertension may include direct attacks on proinflammatory or pro-oxidant vascular mechanisms.", 
    "177": "To update 2 National High Blood Pressure Education Program working group reports on hypertension and chronic renal failure and renovascular hypertension, a working group was appointed by the director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Literature was searched through MEDLINE and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute information center library. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. The working group members produced initial draft documents that were circulated to additional experts on hypertension and renal disease. This reiterative process occurred for 18 draft documents. The final report was sent to the representatives of the 44 organizations on the Coordinating Committee for vote and unanimously approved September 1, 1995. The report recommended treatment of hypertension to the goal of 130/85 mm Hg with whatever therapy is necessary to prevent the development of hypertensive nephrosclerosis or the progression of established renal disease of diverse causes. It seems reasonable to recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as initial therapy for patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria or overt diabetic nephropathy with and without hypertension. Renovascular disease has emerged as a major cause of end-stage renal disease, especially in the elderly. Newer screening procedures for the noninvasive screening of renovascular disease include the captopril test, renal scintigraphy following captopril administration, duplex scanning, and magnetic resonance angiography.", 
    "178": "In the past 2 decades, deaths from stroke have decreased by 59% and deaths from heart attack by 53%. An important component of this dramatic change has been the increased use of antihypertensive drugs. This remarkable success resulted from broad-based and diverse research programs supported by the federal government, pharmaceutical companies, voluntary health agencies, and private foundations. It included basic research, drug development programs, epidemiologic studies, health surveys of US citizens, clinical research, and large-scale drug trials. Four of the categories of antihypertensive drugs in wide use--diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors--emerged from widely different areas of investigation. In the beginning, the major breakthroughs that led to the development of these drugs were impossible to forecast, and their ultimate applications were impossible to predict. Although decreases in hypertension-related mortality are impressive, enthusiasm must be tempered because the mechanisms of hypertension are still incompletely understood and prevention is not yet possible. Continued research is needed to extend these advances.", 
    "179": "In the USA, diabetic nephropathy is involved in 34% of cases of end stage renal failure. In Europe, five-year survival of diabetics with end renal failure is 31%, compared with 55% in the non diabetic population. Three phenomena are involved in the development of nephropathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients: glomerular hyperfiltration, elevation of urinary albumin excretion and high blood pressure, the latter sometimes being present before the discovery of diabetes. Even if control of blood sugar is improved, various prospective studies have failed to demonstrate any benefic effect in terms of reducing renal failure in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Some data indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can reduce the amount of proteinuria and slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, but data remain controversial in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Specifically, in these patients, there is no evidence pointing to an advantage of lowering blood pressure with angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors to reduce morbidity or mortality.",

In addition, after 6 days of culture of islets at 11 mM glucose, there was a significant increase in G3PD activity compared with the enzyme activity of islets cultured at 5.5 mM glucose. Culture of islets at 5.5 mM glucose for 2 days in the presence of forskolin, 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP also significantly increased G3PD activity compared with control islets, although there was no change in enzyme activity after only 1 day of culture with forskolin. Treatment with forskolin was associated with an increase in the Vmax of G3PD, but no change was observed in the apparent K(m) with NAD. IBMX and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP also increased G3PD activity in islets cultured at 11 mM glucose for 2 days. 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP did not affect or inhibit G3PD activity when added directly to islet homogenates. Islets cultured with 8-bromo-cyclic GMP for 2 days at 5.5 or 11 mM glucose did not show changes in G3PD activity. Increases in G3PD activity did not correlate with significant changes in islet glucose utilization. Thus, G3PD activity is modulated by the duration of glucose stimulation in cultured islets, and cyclic AMP may mediate changes in G3PD activity in islet cells.",

Six of them were newly diagnosed, and the rest had already been treated for hypertension. At the start, after six and 12 weeks, 24-hour monitoring was performed. Casual blood pressure (BP) measurements and detection of side-effects were also performed at 3rd and 9th-week. Prior the study the average daytime BP measured by ABPM was 149.1 +/- 7.7/96.6 +/- 4.7 mmHg. 10 mg of benazepril was first administered in the morning. By the end of the sixth week the average BP was significantly decreased (daily average: 139.1 +/- 9.9/88.2 +/- 7.6 mmHg). The daytime diastolic average BP of 8 patients was lower than 90 mmHg and the other's daily dose was raised to 20 mg. During the 12th-week we found optimal tension in 11 patients, while in two others there was also a significant decrease. The daily average BP was 134.7 +/- 7.5/85.6 +/- 6.6 mmHg. In comparison the data at the beginning of the study here was significant decrease in the 24-hour, daytime and night-time BP, in the hypertension time-index and the hyperbaric impact, both in systolic and diastolic levels. During the 12th-week period the diurnal index was unchanged. The early morning BP decreased by the end of the 3rd month from 148.6 +/- 14.1/98.5 +/- 11.7 mmHg to 135.2 +/- 13.5/93.4 +/- 11.2 mmHg. Sustained side-effect did not occur. The patient's compliance to benazepril was excellent. Authors conclude that benazepril monotherapy lowered in 92.8%, and normalized in 78.5% the blood pressure of patients suffering from mild to moderate essential hypertension. The unchanged diurnal index, and the decrease in the early morning blood pressure suggest the 24-hour effect of benazepril.",

    "206": "1. The availability of orally active specific angiotensin receptor antagonists (AT(1) antagonists) has opened new therapeutic choices and provided probes to test the specific role of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. 2. The data available so far suggest that the antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin receptor antagonists is comparable to that of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This provides further evidence that this latter class of drugs exerts its effect mainly through blockade of the renin-angiotensin enzymatic cascade. As expected, the association of a diuretic exerts an equally strong additive effect to the antihypertensive efficacy of both classes of drugs. 3. The most common side effect of ACE inhibitors, dry cough, does not occur with AT(1) antagonists, which confirms the long-held view that this untoward effect of the ACE inhibitors is due to renin-angiotensin-independent mechanisms. 4. Long-term studies with morbidity/mortality outcome results are needed, before a definite position can be assigned to this newcomer in the orchestra of modern antihypertensive drugs. Notwithstanding, this new class of agents already represents an exciting new addition to our therapeutic armamentarium.", 
    "207": "1. Modification of endogenous angiotensin II (AngII)-mediated processes by inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and antagonists of the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1) ) receptor is dependent upon both the levels of each agent in the plasma and tissues and on the concomitant changes in plasma and tissue AngII levels. 2. Both ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists increase renin secretion and angiotensin peptide formation in plasma and extrarenal tissues. Clinical doses of ACE inhibitors produce incomplete inhibition of ACE and the increased AngI levels act to restore AngII towards basal levels. Clinical doses of AT(1) receptor antagonists produce incomplete blockade of AT(1) receptors and the increased AngII levels in plasma and extrarenal tissues counteract (to an unknown degree) the effects of the antagonist. 3. The effects of ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists on AngII levels show tissue specificity. Angiotensin II-mediated processes in the kidney are most sensitive to inhibition by these agents. ACE inhibitors reduce renal AngII levels at doses much less than those required to reduce AngII levels in plasma and other tissues. Moreover, in contrast to increased AngII levels in plasma and extrarenal tissues, renal AngII levels do not increase in response to AT(1) receptor antagonists. The inhibition of AngII-mediated processes in the kidney may, therefore, play a primary role in mediating the effects of ACE inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists on blood pressure and other aspects of cardiovascular function and structure. 4. Combination of an ACE inhibitor with an AT(1) receptor antagonist prevents the rise in plasma AngII levels that occurs with AT(1) receptor antagonism alone. This combination would, therefore, be predicted to produce more effective inhibition of endogenous AngII-mediated processes than either agent alone. We must await further studies to determine whether the combination of ACE inhibition and AT(1) receptor antagonism results in superior clinical outcomes.",

Several components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are detected in the foetal kidney early in development. 3. Angiotensin II is essential for normal foetal and neonatal renal function. 4. Angiotensin II receptors transduce important signals leading to growth and development. 5. Angiotensin receptor subtypes show spatial and temporal specificity of localization throughout renal development. 6. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or AngII receptor blockade (specifically AT(1) subtype blockade) results in functional and structural abnormalities of the developing kidney in both experimental and clinical situations. 7. While chronic postnatal RAS blockade in rats is associated with structural damage to tubules and blood vessels of the kidney, reports differ on whether treatment also affects glomerular induction and growth. 8. In metanephric organ culture, glomerular induction proceeds despite AngII receptor blockade. 9. In summary, the evidence suggests that AngII is not essential for nephron induction and glomerular development in the rat kidney. However, AngII is essential for normal growth and development of renal tubules and vasculature.",

The values of GFR and FF were significantly higher (P < 0.01 and P < 0.005, respectively) in NIDDM than in normal volunters, whereas ERPF was comparable in both groups. Meanwhile we observed that UAE of early NIDDM was increased before treatment. After CPT treatment, GFR, FF, UAE and urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1a were significantly reduce (all P < 0.005) compared with those of NIDDM before treatment.

    "214": "Renal artery stenosis has become increasingly common as a cause of refractory hypertension and renal insufficiency. There is a high prevalence of bilateral disease and the lesions tend to progress over time. Newer, less invasive, imaging modalities such as doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, and spiral CT scanning are evolving technologies in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. Advances in surgical technique, particularly the development of extra-anatomical procedures such as spleno-renal and hepato-renal by pass, have significantly lowered surgical morbidity and mortality and provides revascularization options for patients with complex vascular disease that would previously not have been considered because of their high surgical risk. Improvements in angioplasty technique and the use of stents are broadening the types of lesions that can be successfully approached with these techniques and may be particularly helpful for patients with more severe cardiac or cerebrovascular disease. The benefits of revascularization may be even greater for preservation of renal function than for control of blood pressure in properly selected patients. It is difficult to predict which patients will benefit from surgical revascularization versus medical management of RAS. Knowledge of the progressive nature of RAS, the high prevalence of bilateral disease, and the clinical characteristics that correlate with progression (e.g., decreasing renal size) are helpful in guiding clinical decisions regarding intervention. Additional studies to determine the predictive value of non-invasive tests such as CRS, doppler ultrasound before and after administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and other tests, are needed to assist the clinician in identifying who will benefit most from revascularization both in terms of renal function and blood pressure control.",

Measurement of renal vein renin levels and renal angiography are invasive tests commonly used. The latter allows an anatomical diagnosis of renal vein stenosis but does not give information about the functional consequences of such lesion and thus, does not predict the response of blood pressure to revascularization. Radionuclide renography has become the most useful non invasive diagnostic test, with a sensitivity and specificity of 83-94 and 85-97% respectively. It also predicts clinical response to revascularization and is useful for follow up after surgery or angioplasty. It also has good results in patients with renal failure, bilateral stenosis or stenosis in a solitary kidney and in transplanted patients.",

In short-term treatment, five doses of perindopril were examined in random order separated by a one week recovery period in each of six rabbits. Two doses of perindopril which resulted in a moderate hypotensive effect (-14 mmHg) and no hypotensive effect, respectively, were then selected for long-term treatment. Each rabbit in the short-term study received perindopril in doses of 0.01, 0.06, 0.32, 1.8 and 10 mg kg-1 day-1 for a week at a time. Rabbits on long-term treatment received either 0.3 or 0.01 mg kg-1 day-1 perindopril for six weeks. All rabbits had their mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate recorded throughout treatment. Plasma angiotensin I (AngI), perindoprilat, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition were also assayed. Perindopril treatment for one week produced a dose-dependent hypotensive effect with the threshold dose, 0.06 mg kg-1 day-1, producing a 6.5 +/- 1.8 mmHg fall in MAP. The highest dose (10.0 mg kg-1 day-1) produced a large fall in blood pressure of -29.6 +/- 4.2 mmHg. The 0.01 and 0.06 mg kg-1 day-1 doses of perindopril produced an average 2.65 fold increase in plasma AngI levels compared to the initial control. The three higher doses (0.32-10.0 mg kg-1 day-1) of perindopril produced an equivalent 5.7 fold increase in plasma AngI levels compared to the initial controls. However, over six weeks 0.01 mg kg-1 day-1 perindopril induced a similar decrease in MAP as the 30 fold higher dose (-9.3 mmHg compared to -11.7 mmHg,). This was in spite of a 3 fold difference in plasma perindoprilat concentrations between the high and low dose perindopril groups. Plasma ACE inhibition was > 80% with both doses of perindopril. The results indicate that while perindopril decreases MAP in a dose-dependent manner in short-term (one week) periods, over longer treatment times (six weeks) low concentrations of perindopril, non-hypotensive with short-term treatment, may be as anti-hypertensive as considerably higher doses.",

None of the treatments induced regression of increased myocardial collagen levels. The slopes of the end-diastolic stress-strain relationships in the isolated beating hearts were significantly higher in HT4W, HT12W and in both treated groups compared with those in the SHAM group, indicating increased diastolic myocardial stiffness.", 
    "248": "Losartan and enalapril treatments decreased blood pressure and induced complete regression of LVH in this model of renovascular hypertension. In contrast, none of the treatments induced regression of increased myocardial collagen levels or reduced the abnormal left ventricular diastolic stiffness. These data suggest that diastolic dysfunction depends more on increased myocardial collagen levels than it does on myocardial mass in this model of pathological LVH.", 
    "249": "This double-blind, randomised, cross-over study investigated the antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril and enalapril was completed by 30 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a four-week placebo run-in phase, the patients received either 2.5mg ramipril or 10mg enalapril once daily for four weeks. The dosages were increased to 5mg ramipril and 20mg enalapril for a further four weeks. After a placebo washout phase of four weeks, the patients were crossed over to the alternative treatment. The decrease in average 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure from week 0 to week 8 was 1.6mmHg greater with ramipril than enalapril (90% confidence interval 0.6-2.7mmHg). The corresponding reduction in for systolic blood pressure was also greater with ramipril than enalapril by 2.4mmHg (90% confidence interval: 0.5-4.2mmHg). For the difference in the drop of 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure between ramipril and enalapril the lower level of the 90% confidence interval (CI) is above the clinically relevant difference of -3mmHg. This is an indication that ramipril (2.5 and 5mg dose) is at least as effective as enalapril (10 and 20mg dose) in decreasing blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. The duration of adequate antihypertensive effect was relatively long for both ramipril and enalapril; however, ramipril tended to have a more prolonged antihypertensive effect. Ramipril had a higher diastolic and systolic trough/peak ratio than enalapril, resulting in a more uniform antihypertensive effect over the 24-hour treatment period. Both ramipril and enalapril were well tolerated and the two treatment groups had similar safety profiles.", 
    "250": "Previous studies have shown that chronic treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is effective in causing the regression of hypertension and vascular structural changes in adult SHR. The purpose of this study was to determine the involvement of angiotensin type 1 receptors in the maintenance of hypertension and vascular changes in adult SHR. Three groups of 15-week-old male SHR were treated with three different doses of the angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist L-158,809. After 12 weeks of treatment, average systolic blood pressure was reduced in a dose-dependent manner from 206 +/- 2 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa) in the control SHR to 154 +/- 7 mmHg in the 0.6 mg/kg group, 172 +/- 3 mmHg in the 0.3 mg/kg group, and 196 +/- 8 mmHg in the 0.1 mg/kg group. Withdrawal of the treatment caused a rapid rise in blood pressure within 1 week, and 14-16 weeks after treatment had been withdrawn, blood pressure of SHR treated with the highest dose had increased to 169 +/- 8 mmHg. Blood pressure of the SHR treated with the two lower doses had increased to the level of the untreated SHR. Mean blood pressure, diastolic pressure, and pulse pressure were significantly reduced in the SHR treated with 0.6 mg/kg L-158,809. The arterial media cross-sectional area and media to lumen ratio were reduced by L-158,809 treatment (0.6 mg/kg dose). Treatment did not affect body weight or heart rate. Contractile response of the mesenteric arteries to nerve or norepinephrine stimulation was not affected by the treatment. However, arteries from treated SHR did not show an angiotensin II potentiation of nerve-stimulated response, as was observed in the control SHR. We conclude that persistent control of blood pressure by treatment with L-158,809 is associated with its effects on the structure and function of the arteries in the SHR.", 
    "251": "The fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension complicating pregnancy primarily results from pre-eclampsia. This review focuses on recent developments in the areas of prevention and management. It specifically analyses studies designed to determine whether low-dose aspirin or calcium supplements, taken throughout pregnancy, reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia, a debate on whether we have been too aggressive in terminating pregnancies in patients with severe pre-eclampsia remote from term, and the efficacy of parenteral magnesium sulfate in the prevention or treatment, or both, of the eclamptic convulsion. We conclude that neither aspirin nor calcium appears to improve the gestational outcome, although large trials currently under way may alter this view. The debate on 'conservative' versus aggressive management of early-onset severe pre-eclampsia seems to be more apparent than real. After years of acrimonious debate there are data to support the superiority of magnesium over phenytoin to prevent pre-eclampsia and the efficacy of the drug in reducing recurrent convulsions in eclampsia. However, whether 'prophylactic' therapy is indeed necessary or whether blood pressure control alone will prevent eclampsia remains to be determined.", 
    "252": "There is no specific treatment to reduce glomerular IgA deposition in IgA nephropathy. The available controlled trials are restricted to patients with proteinuria and progressive renal failure where mechanisms of injury are common to other chronic glomerular diseases. Control of blood pressure is vital, but there is no conclusive evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the agents of choice. Fish oil appears to be beneficial, but the available trial data are not entirely consistent. Immunosuppressive regimens based on corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents may be beneficial, but there is concern over long-term toxicity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphisms may identify cohorts who are at special risk of progressive renal failure for recruitment into future trials.", 
    "253": "There is little published data on the demand for echocardiography services in the U.K. This retrospective survey of echocardiography request forms and reports was performed to assess potential changes in echocardiography request patterns between 1988 and 1993. These years were chosen as they were likely to reflect changes in clinical practice as a result of trials involving Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. A total of 400 consecutive request forms and reports were analysed. There was a 2.46 fold increase in the total number of echocardiograms performed between 1988 and 1993 with a disproportionate 12.5 fold increase in the relative number of requests for assessments of left ventricular function. This large increase is likely to be a result of recent major clinical trials which show morbidity and mortality benefits when patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (including those who are asymptomatic) are treated with ACE inhibitors. Future planning of the echocardiographic services should include provision for the increasing numbers of patients requiring assessment of left ventricular function.", 
    "254": "SURROGATE END-POINTS: Pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular disease has been increasingly validated in large interventional trials to assess its efficacy, safety and costs. As endpoints, morbidity and mortality are evaluated. More recently, surrogate end-points have been included in interventional trials, both to increase our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and for their potential use as markers of risk in patients.", 
    "255": "The endothelium lies in a strategic anatomical position between the circulating blood and vascular smooth muscle and hence is a major local mediator of cardiovascular function. Also, endothelial cells are a target for mechanical forces and cardiovascular risk factors in the circulation. Thus, it is not surprising that their function becomes impaired at an early stage in the disease process. The cells are able to produce numerous proteins and mediators. This review focuses on nitric oxide and endothelin-1, which are endothelium-derived relaxing and constrictor factors, respectively. Nitric oxide also prevents platelet adhesion and aggregation and the adhesion of monocytes. Both substances also affect vascular structure in that nitric oxide inhibits while endothelin stimulates vascular smooth muscle proliferation and migration.", 
    "256": "Endothelial function and the effects of nitric oxide and endothelin in particular can be evaluated in the coronary circulation by quantitative coronary angiography and Doppler flow wire, and in the peripheral circulation with plethysmography and new ultrasound/Doppler devices. In these experimental set-ups, lipid-lowering drugs and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been evaluated. Lipid-lowering drugs improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the coronary and forearm circulation of patients with hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Similarly, ACE inhibitors improve coronary vasomotion in patients with coronary artery disease and normal lipid levels. In hypertension, ACE inhibitors have failed to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation, while studies with other drugs are planned.", 
    "257": "Endothelial function can now be assessed precisely in patients in vivo, in both the coronary and the peripheral circulation. Tests can detect early dysfunction in patients with a risk of cardiovascular disease and the possible effects of drugs on endothelial function. Large interventional trials are needed to establish how far endothelial dysfunction can or cannot predict clinical outcome.", 
    "258": "Microalbuminuria is defined as abnormally elevated urinary albumin excretion below the level of clinical albuminuria (albustix). This represents a urinary albumin excretion rate of 20-200 micrograms/min, equal to 30-300 mg/24 h. Urinary albumin excretion can vary as much as 40% with natural fluctuations, and so several tests should be done. Inexpensive radioimmunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or immunoturbidimetric assays are now routine in many clinical laboratories.", 
    "259": "The prevalence of microalbuminuria in essential hypertension and diabetes is about the same: 25% (range 14-31) and 20% (9-27), respectively.", 
    "260": "Increased transglomerular passage is the major mechanism of microalbuminuria in both the above-mentioned conditions; increased hydraulic glomerular capillary pressure and glomerular lesions probably both contribute. Microalbuminuria is highly predictive of the development of diabetic nephropathy but the predictive power in relation to hypertensive nephropathy remains to be established. However, in both conditions microalbuminuria is associated with an increased risk of retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The following mechanisms have been suggested as a link between microalbuminuria and these findings: endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipoproteinemia and a procoagulant state.", 
    "261": "Blood pressure lowering reduces microalbuminuria in essential hypertension and in diabetes mellitus. Long-term studies in diabetes suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors postpone, and may even prevent, progression to overt clinical nephropathy in normotensive diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria. So far, there have been no long-term comparative trials on the beneficial effects of different antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria.", 
    "262": "METHODS OF CURRENT TRIALS: Several ongoing trials are investigating the anti-atherosclerotic effects of antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients. Changes in carotid intimal-medial thicknesses and atherosclerotic plaques are being explored by a sensitive quantitative B-mode ultrasound technique. MULTICENTER ISRADIPINE/DIURETIC ATHEROSCLEROSIS STUDY (MIDAS): The results from this pioneering study indicated a slower progression, at least in the first 6 months, of carotid plaques in isradipine-treated patients than in diuretic-treated patients. MIDAS has been particularly valuable in giving information on the rate of growth of intimal-medial thickness in hypertensive patients and on the best end-point to use in carotid ultrasound trials. EUROPEAN LACIDIPINE STUDY ON ATHEROSCLEROSIS (ELSA) AND VERAPAMIL IN HYPERTENSION AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS STUDY (VHAS): Baseline data from these two ongoing studies have provided evidence of the very high prevalence of carotid lesions among hypertensive patients: the prevalence of plaques (defined as a carotid intimal-medial thickness of > or = 1.3 mm) was 83% in ELSA, while in VHAS, in which plaques were defined as an intimal-medial thickness of > 1.5 mm), the plaque prevalence was 37%. These observations emphasize the importance of evaluating the atherosclerotic action of antihypertensive agents. PLAQUE HYPERTENSION LIPID-LOWERING ITALIAN STUDY (PHYLLIS): This trial is using a factorial design to explore the anti-atherosclerotic action of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (fosinopril) versus a diuretic, and also intends to evaluate the possible benefits of associating antihypertensive therapy with a statin to induce lipid-lowering to prevent the progression of carotid atherosclerosis.", 
    "263": "To review the beneficial effect on renal function of antihypertensive treatment in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "264": "Several prospective, randomized trials have demonstrated that blood pressure control reduces the incidence of stroke and coronary heart disease mortality but end-stage renal disease secondary to essential hypertension has increased by 16-26% during the last decade. This apparent discordance can be explained by the reduction in brain and heart mortality, so that a greater proportion of renal damage is produced, or by a failure of antihypertensive drugs to protect the kidney as efficiently as other organs. MECHANISMS OF RENAL DAMAGE IN ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION: Two mechanisms have been proposed. One hypothesis is that renal ischemia affects different kidney zones by producing periglomerular fibrosis, intimal amplification with hyaline deposits and reduction of the vessel lumen. The second hypothesis proposes that the elevation of intraglomerular pressure observed with secondary glomerular sclerosis is regulated by afferent-efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction or vasodilation. PARAMETERS FOR MEASURING RENAL FUNCTION: Creatinine clearance is the most appropriate method to measure glomerular filtration rate in routine clinical practice. Serum creatinine is not elevated until renal function is reduced below 50 ml/ min. The Cockcroft formula has been proposed in order to calculate creatinine clearance from plasma creatinine levels. Microalbuminuria and proteinuria are two other parameters that can be used to measure renal damage. ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT: Antihypertensive therapy with concomitant control of blood pressure reduces protein excretion and the hypertension-induced deterioration in renal function. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists have shown good renal protection, and a combination of these two types of drugs may improve results and reduce side effects.", 
    "265": "In the past decade, end-stage renal disease secondary to essential hypertension is increased despite a clear reduction in stroke and coronary heart disease mortality resulting from blood pressure control. Measurements of creatinine clearance, serum creatinine in advanced renal failure, microalbuminuria and proteinuria are adequate indicators of renal damage. Blood pressure control with any class of drugs reduces the progression of renal failure and proteinuria, but ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists seem to provide better renal protection; ACE inhibitors have a greater antiproteinuric effect. The combination of these two types of drugs might further reduce renal damage and side effects.", 
    "266": "Usual blood pressure levels have been shown to be directly and continuously associated with the risks of initial and recurrent stroke. Blood pressure lowering has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of a first stroke in hypertensive patients, but there is uncertainty about the effects of reducing blood pressure in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease, for whom stroke risks are particularly high. The primary objective of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) is to determine the effects of blood pressure reduction on stroke risk in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease.", 
    "267": "PROGRESS is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-based blood pressure lowering treatment regimen. Before randomization, there is a 4-week run-in phase on open-label treatment, after which patients are assigned to continued treatment or to placebo. Following randomization, the trial treatments comprise perindopril (4 mg daily) plus indapamide (2.5 mg daily) or matching placebos for patients without an indication for or contraindication to treatment with a diuretic, and perindopril alone or matching placebo for all other patients. The scheduled duration of treatment and follow-up is a minimum of 4 years.",

However, there is still concern that the full potential for reversing coronary heart disease in the hypertensive patient has not been realized by treatment with established agents, the diuretics and the beta-blockers. TRIALS ON NEWER AGENTS: A question that still remains to be answered is whether treatment regimens based on alternative drugs, including calcium channel blocking agents and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, will confer an advantage over older drugs. This question is at last being addressed in long-term morbidity and mortality trials with these newer agents.",

Although a number of prospective, randomly allocated trials under way at present are investigating the effects of treatment with calcium antagonists on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, these results are not yet available. Therefore, the present approach may be useful. A fuller account of this work has been published in Blood Pressure.",

    "275": "In all trials, 2-6 mg lacidipine was effective in lowering blood pressure. In the controlled trials, systolic/diastolic blood pressure fell from 166/102 to 144/85 mmHg and the heart rate fell from 75.6 to 74.1 beats/min. The estimated event rate for a possible myocardial infarction in all studies was 5.46/1000 person-years; the fatal (all-cause) event rate was 5.27/1000 person-years and the estimated fatal cardiovascular event rate was 2.93/1000 person-years. There were 21 malignant events during treatment with lacidipine, for all studies yielding a crude incidence of 4.10/1000 person-years. In patients treated with lacidipine, the age-standardized (according to the world population) incidences were 1.49 (men) and 0.79/1000 person-years (women) compared with 2.74 (men) and 2.09/1000 person-years (women) in the European Community in 1990. The overall incidence in the comparative studies of one or more adverse events included 30.3% for lacidipine, 43.8% for other calcium antagonists, 18.7% for diuretics, 48.7% for beta-receptor blockers, 10.4% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and 15.7% for placebo. The adverse effects of lacidipine were, as expected, headaches, flushing, pedal oedema and palpitations.", 
    "276": "Lacidipine proved to be an effective and well tolerated drug in almost 19000 hypertensive patients. It displayed a reasonable adverse profile that was typical of a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine group. This analysis has two obvious limitations: (1) it is a retrospective analysis; and (2) the data were obtained from a large cohort of patients, but most were treated with lacidipine for a relatively short period of time. Although we found a lower fatal event rate than that reported by Collins et al., their meta-analysis included 10 times more person-years than our analysis, and therefore our event rate may be less accurate. Further prospective studies are under way at present to determine whether these drugs can produce reductions in atherosclerosis or in the incidence of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "277": "A drug surveillance study was performed to determine the tolerance and safety of quinapril in the treatment of patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension. The trial was noncomparative, open-label, uncontrolled, and nonrandomized. Patients with secondary hypertension, heart failure, other heart diseases, and other serious conditions were excluded. After a washout period of 2 weeks, 752 patients (316 men and 436 women) with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 90 and 115 mm Hg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 140 and 200 mm Hg were entered into the treatment phase. The mean age of patients (+/- SD) was 53.1 +/- 11.4 years. Patients initially received 10 mg/d quinapril for 4 weeks. For nonresponders, the dosage was titrated up to a maximum of 40 mg. Active treatment continued for 12 weeks. Initial blood pressures (mean +/- SD) were DBP, 102 +/- 6.1 mm Hg, and SBP, 163 +/- 14.4 mm Hg. Final blood pressures were DBP, 83 +/- 6.5 mm Hg, and SBP, 135 +/- 11.6 mm Hg. The response rate for the therapeutic goal (DBP < 90 mm Hg and SBP < 140 mm Hg, or a reduction in SBP > or = 20 mm Hg) was 67.1%; 41 patients did not complete the study. The most common adverse events were cough, headache, and dizziness; only 10 patients (1.3%) failed to complete the study because of adverse events. Quinapril, as used in current private clinical practice, is well tolerated and effective for the treatment of patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension.", 
    "278": "Treatment of high blood pressure has considerably postponed the development of heart failure in these patients. The repercussions of high blood pressure on the heart first consist in diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricule and then in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are to be considered as the drugs of first choice in these patients. In the future, beta-blockers could play an important role in the management in some categories of patients.", 
    "279": "Experimental studies have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have an important role in blocking the progression of and/or reversing endothelial dysfunction. The extrapolation of these experimental studies to the clinical situation has, however, been disappointing. Studies of forearm-mediated endothelial vasodilatation in patients with hypertension with captopril, enalapril, and cilazapril have been negative. The finding of the Trial in Reversing Endothelial Dysfunction (TREND) that the administration of quinapril to normotensive patients with coronary artery disease in part restores endothelial-mediated coronary vasodilation, as assessed by intracoronary administration of acetylcholine, has important implications for future therapy and raises several important questions. The differences in the TREND and previous studies of ACE inhibitors on endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. Although in general there has been a good correlation between endothelial dysfunction as assessed by forearm flow and coronary endothelial dysfunction as assessed by acetylcholine, these vascular beds may be affected differently by therapeutic interventions, especially with an ACE inhibitor, which may affect shear stress and angiotensin II formation in different vascular beds differently. Third, one needs to question whether the effect of quinapril on coronary endothelial dysfunction is a class effect or unique to quinapril. It will be necessary to test the effectiveness of other ACE inhibitors on coronary endothelial dysfunction in humans before concluding that the beneficial effects of quinapril are due to a class effect.", 
    "280": "An immunoassay for the quantitation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril in human plasma is described. Antisera very specific for captopril were produced by immunization with captopril conjugated to bovine serum albumin or porcine thyroglobulin via the drug's thiol group. The antibodies were used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a detection limit of 0.3 ng mL-1 and intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 7 and 12%, respectively. Apart from stabilizing captopril by the addition of N-ethyl maleimide, the assay was used to detect the drug in human plasma without further extraction or purification. Our immunoassay provides a very sensitive and rapid (four hours) alternative for the study of captopril pharmacokinetics.", 
    "281": "1. Dogs were exposed to hypoxemia followed by a coronary angiogram at three different times: under control conditions, after ischemia-reperfusion injury, then 30 min later. 2. In the study group, the dogs were treated with trandolapril (0.05 mg/kg) and verapamil (0.1 mg/ kg) just prior to the final hypoxic challenge. 3. Under control conditions, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) dilated in response to hypoxia. Following ischemia-reperfusion injury, however, it constricted significantly in response. 4. In the control group, repeat hypoxia 30 min later resulted in vasoconstriction of the LAD which was comparable to the preceding response. 5. However, in the study group, treatment with trandolapril plus verapamil inhibited the vasoconstriction in response to repeat hypoxia.", 
    "282": "The aim of this study was to investigate if prostaglandin (PG) metabolism is altered by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as determined in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the guinea pig. Enalapril or imidapril was orally administered once a day for 2 weeks to Hartley male guinea pigs. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, BALF was collected and the concentrations of PGI2, thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and PGE2 were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Enalapril significanlty P < 0.05) increased the TXA2 content, which was inhibited by indomethacin treatment and significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the PGI2 content. Imidapril, however, did not affect TXA2 or PGI2 generation. These findings suggest that altered PG metabolism may be associated with coughing as a side effect of enalapril.", 
    "283": "An atheroma-like neo-intima was produced by positioning a flexible collar around the common carotid arteries of normocholesterolaemic rabbits. Vessel segments taken from the mid-region of the collared and control region of the same artery were studied 7 days after surgery. Placebo rabbits were provided ab libitum with regular tap water, and treated animals were supplied with water containing perindopril (0.3 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Perindopril treatment reduced plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity by 88%, but did not significantly alter arterial blood pressure or heart rate. In control rings from placebo rabbits perindoprilat in vitro (0.1-1.0 microM) reduced the sensitivity to angiotension I up to 20-fold but did not affect that of angiotensin II. In placebo rabbits, the collared arterial segments were approximately five-fold more sensitive to the vasoconstrictor action of 5-HT (P < 0.05) than the corresponding control segments. Perindopril treatment did not prevent the supersensitivity of the collared vessels to 5-HT. Development of the lesion in placebo or perindopril-treated rabbits did not alter the vascular sensitivity to either angiotensin I (10(-9)-10(-5)M) or angiotensin II (10(-10)-10(-6)M). The vasorelaxant action of sodium nitroprusside was similar in collared and control rings, whereas the maximum endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant response to acetylcholine was reduced from 68 +/- 5% in control rings, to 44 +/- 8% (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 9, P < 0.05) in collared rings of placebo-treated rabbits. In the perindopril-treated animals, this impairment of relaxation was restored in collared vessels and was no longer significantly different from the control sections. In contrast, perindoprilat in vitro (1.0 microM) did not alter the vasorelaxant response to acetylcholine in control or collared rings in a separate series of placebo rabbits. Morphologically, vessel segments taken from the centre of the collared artery of all placebo rabbits showed a thickened intima filled with cells that had the appearance of synthetic-state smooth muscle. The intimal/medial cross-sectional area ratio was reduced from 0.11 +/- 0.02 (n = 10) in placebo rabbits to 0.05 +/- 0.01 (n = 9) in perindopril-treated rabbits, whereas cross-sectional area of media of the collared vessels was similar in the two groups. Thus ACE may have important roles in the initiation and progression of atheroma-like lesions. Inhibition of ACE with perindopril reduces intimal thickening and restores the defective vasodilatation induced by the endothelial-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine.", 
    "284": "Evaluation of safety and efficacy of new drugs is based largely on data from clinical trials involving a limited number of patients. This approach does not necessarily detect the rare adverse events that may only be observed when very large numbers of patients are studied. Consequently, we designed a double-blind 12-week trial comparing the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril (n = 5,053), with a well-established beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, metoprolol (n = 506). Essentially hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mm Hg) received either 10 mg quinapril or 50 mg metoprolol once daily, and the doses were doubled at 4-week intervals to a maximum of 40 and 200 mg, respectively, in nonresponders. Responder rates were similar under both regimens. Adverse events were assessed by interview as well as by a standard questionnaire. The overall prevalence of adverse events reported by standard questionnaire was higher than that reported spontaneously during interviews. With respect to typical ACE inhibitor adverse reactions (e.g. cough and taste disturbances), there was no difference between quinapril and metoprolol independent of the mode of reporting. In summary, both drugs showed comparable overall tolerance and safety. The discrepancy between spontaneously reported and questionnaire-reported adverse events was noteworthy, and this finding prevailed in a volunteer group of 327 patients who were treated with quinapril for 52 weeks. Thus, a questionnaire is of great significance in addition to the patient history/interview in a large-scale, double-blind study designed to learn about details of drug safety.", 
    "285": "In a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel study, we assessed basal and post-therapeutic sympathetic activity both in supine and standing positions in mildly to moderately hypertensive patients by two different methods: frequency domain indices of heart rate variability (HRV) and plasma levels of both noradrenaline (NA) and its metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DOPEG). Patients were evaluated on placebo and after 8 weeks of treatment with either cilazapril, 2.5-5 mg/day (13 patients) or atenolol, 50-100 mg/day (14 patients). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure was similarly reduced (p < 0.01) by both cilazapril and atenolol. Heart rate decreased with atenolol by 14 beats per min (p < 0.001) but did not change with cilazapril. When compared to the placebo, cilazapril did not modify sympathetic activity indices of HRV but did significantly reduce NA and DOPEG levels in both the supine and standing (p < 0.05) positions. As expected, atenolol reduced (p < 0.05) sympathetic activity indices of HRV but did not modify NA levels in either position. Moreover, while on placebo, patients showed no significant correlations between values of NA or DOPEG, nor in any of the HRV indices. We conclude that: (1) the antihypertensive effects of cilazapril and atenolol are similar, but in these patients, sympathetic activity indices showed divergent results both before and after therapy; (2) this may be due to different aspects of sympathetic activators, assessed independently by different methods, and (3) these discrepancies must be taken into account when evaluating autonomous nervous system parameters.", 
    "286": "Noninvasive diagnostic methods for evaluation of renal arteries continue to improve. Contrast arteriography is the reference standard to which other techniques are compared, and preoperative arteriography before operative or endovascular therapy remains the practice standard. However, noninvasive examination methods have supplanted arteriography as a screening test for renal artery occlusive disease, and they allow more selective use of the invasive technique. ACE inhibitor-enhanced renal scintigraphy has improved on the sensitivity of standard renal scintigraphy, but several investigators found it still lacks when significant renal dysfunction is present. A positive scan implies the renal artery lesion is functionally significant and is predictive of a response to therapy. Although ACE inhibitor-enhanced renal scintigraphy can detect significant renal artery disease, it can neither localize the arterial lesion nor can it characterize the severity of the stenosis. Renal scintigraphy therefore lacks utility as a method to follow progression of the arterial disease. Magnetic resonance and helical CT imaging are advanced technologies that acquire axial imaging data, but with advanced software and powerful image processing hardware, the anatomic information can be represented in multiple planes or with three-dimensional reconstructions. The anatomic information provided is not limited to the renal arteries, but can define relationships to the surrounding anatomy. Validation studies from several institutions suggest that although these methods for renal artery assessment may be sufficiently accurate for screening use, they remain relatively expensive and are just now becoming more widely available. Not all patients can be studied. Helical CT scanning requires a relatively large intravenous contrast dose, which is undesirable in patients with renal insufficiency, and it seems to underestimate severity of some renal artery stenoses. MRA is impractical or unsafe for patients with claustrophobia, cardiac dysrhythmias, pacemakers, certain types of metallic implants or clips, or for seriously ill patients requiring monitoring. Duplex scanning is both sensitive and specific. It is the least expensive of the available diagnostic modalities, and it is completely safe and noninvasive. Not only is the presence of a renal artery lesion detectable, the severity of the stenosis can be categorized and its hemodynamic significance or renal blood flow can be evaluated. Renal artery duplex scanning is the optimal method for renal artery assessment when it is available from a validated vascular laboratory. However, this last point is the key. The utility of the study is entirely dependent on the skill and experience of the examining technologist. Other drawbacks to duplex scanning include the fact that to yield the \"whole picture\" of the anatomy and pathology requires a mental synthesis. Real-time scanning generates a series of images and flow data that must be interpreted with a understanding of how the scan was performed. Clinical circumstances, local expertise, equipment availability, costs, and other important considerations will factor into the decision-making process of planning a work-up for suspected renal artery stenosis. The noninvasive diagnostic technologies continue to advance, and as new methods are validated, the need for arteriography may be further lessened.", 
    "287": "The purpose of this study was to determine the additive value of ibopamine in heart failure patients who are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Ibopamine exerts hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects, and is beneficial in mild heart failure; however, its additive value in more advanced disease in unclear.", 
    "288": "The study was a stand-alone, double-blind, randomized parallel group comparison of ibopamine (100 mg 3 times daily) and placebo in 59 patients with New York Heart Association functional class III-IV heart failure. Patients were clinically stable on drug treatment, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and they were randomized to ibopamine (n = 29) or placebo (n = 30). Assessments were performed at baseline and after 3 months of treatment, and included measurement of peak oxygen consumption, plasma neurohormones, ambulatory arrhythmias, and heart rate variability. At baseline, the two groups were well matched, including age (mean, 63 years), left ventricular ejection fraction (0.23), and peak oxygen consumption (15.4 mL/min/kg). After 3 months, four patients had dropped out of the study because of progressive heart failure (ibopamine, n = 1; placebo, n = 3; not significant) and two because of side effects (n = 1/1). Exercise time and peak oxygen consumption were not significantly affected (exercise time: ibopamine, +54 [95% confidence interval, -12, 120] seconds; placebo, +19 [-42, 81] seconds; peak oxygen consumption: ibopamine, +0.3 [-0.5, 1,2] mL/min/kg; placebo, +0.2 [-0.7, 1.0] mL/min/kg). Plasma neurohormones and ventricular arrhythmias during ambulatory monitoring were also unaffected. In contrast, heart rate variability parameters, in particular those associated with vagal tone (rMMSD, high-frequency power), significantly increased after 3 months on ibopamine (P = .01 vs placebo).", 
    "289": "In this group of patients with clinically stable moderate to severe chronic heart failure, only a marginal and statistically nonsignificant effect on clinical parameters was observed after 3 months of treatment with ibopamine. Heart rate variability parameters, however, were significantly affected by ibopamine, despite the absence of an effect on plasma neurohormones.",

    "291": "Initially, 26 patients were included in the study group. After clinical, radiographic, and radionuclide examination, each patient underwent right heart catheterization (Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter). Plasma noradrenaline levels were measured. In two patients, a favorable hemodynamic response to L-dopa was not observed, another two required permanent pacemaker implantation. These four patients were excluded from the study. Two patients required permanent pacemaker implantation. The remaining 22 patients with favorable hemodynamic response to L-dopa (increase in cardiac index, stroke volume index, reduction in total systemic resistance) were randomized in a nonblinded fashion to the conventional (11 patients) or conventional plus L-dopa (11 patients) treatment groups. During the study period, two patients, one from each group, died. They were excluded from the analysis. The final analyzed study group consisted of 20 men, aged 33-69, in New York Heart Association functional class IV (9 patients) and III (11 patients). The cause of congestive heart failure was primary dilated cardiomyopathy in 11 patients and ischemic heart disease in 9 patients. After 3 months' treatment, all patients were crossed over. Clinical, radiographic, radionuclide, and hemodynamic evaluation was repeated at the end of the 3-month treatment period. After 3 months of therapy with L-dopa in each group (covariance analysis), there was improvement in clinical, radiographic (relative heart volume, -128 mL/m2), radionuclide (left ventricular ejection fraction, +4.6; right ventricular ejection fraction, +4.8%), hemodynamic (mean pulmonary wedge pressure, -8 mmHg; total systemic resistance, -1.8 Wu; total pulmonary resistance, -3.5 Wu), and neurohumoral (noradrenaline, -218 pg/mL) measures.",

    "293": "Effects of isoproterenol (ISO) on the expression of cardiac angiotensinogen mRNA, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and mechanical functions in spontaneously hypertensive rats were investigated. In the acute phase, defined as within 24 h after the subcutaneous injection of ISO 85 mg/kg, cardiac angiotensinogen mRNA was slightly induced, but ACE activity was not. In the subacute phase, defined as within 8 d after ISO treatment on 2 successive d, both angiotensinogen mRNA expression and ACE activity in the heart were markedly induced. ACE activity in serum was not affected by ISO in either phase. In the subacute phase, ISO reduced body weight and blood pressure, increased ventricular weight and calcium content, and impaired cardiac mechanical function. Oral treatment with imidapril (10 mg/kg/d), an ACE inhibitor, 1 h before each ISO treatment and on the following 6 d, improved ventricular hypertrophy, the elevation of the left ventricular end diastolic pressure, the reduction in contractility, and the prolongation of the time constant. Imidapril significantly suppressed both serum and cardiac ACE activity but did not affect cardiac angiotensinogen mRNA expression in the subacute phase. These results indicate that enhancement of cardiac angiotensinogen mRNA and ACE activity is involved in ISO-induced cardiac dysfunction. Imidapril improved ISO-induced cardiac dysfunction, possibly by suppression of the local ACE activity as well as circulating ACE activity.", 
    "294": "The present study was designed to clarify whether modulation of norepinephrine (NE) release by vascular angiotensin (Ang) II is involved in the increased peripheral sympathetic activity of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In the perfusion system of isolated mesenteric vascular beds, periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS)-evoked NE overflow was significantly greater in SHR than Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Administration of Ang II increased PNS-induced NE overflow, which could be reversed by pretreatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist CV-11974 in both types of rats; the facilitation by Ang II was more potent in SHR. Moreover, CV-11974 by itself could attenuate PNS-evoked NE overflow, the extent of which was also significantly greater in SHR, suggesting an augmented sympatho-facilitatory effect of endogenous Ang II in SHR. Consistently, sympatho-facilitation by Ang I, which could be abolished by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidaprilat, was apparently greater than that of Ang II in SHR, despite no difference in WKY. These findings suggest that the increased peripheral sympathetic activity in SHR is attributed not only to the elevated sensitivity of nerve endings to Ang II but also to the increased local generation of Ang II, an effect possibly mediated by augmented vascular ACE activity.", 
    "295": "The cardiovascular consequences of mixed angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase (ACE/NEP) inhibition with alatriopril/alatrioprilat were compared with the consequences of endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition alone with (S)-thiorphan/ecadotril by determining the acute effects of the compounds on hemodynamic, hormonal, and renal parameters in hypertensive transgenic rats harboring an additional mouse renin gene (TGR(mRen2)27). Infusion of alatrioprilat and (S)-thiorphan in anesthetized TGR decreased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner, but heart rate remained unchanged. The renal excretion of water, sodium, and cGMP also increased dose-dependently, with nearly the same maximal effects after infusion of (S)-thiorphan and alatrioprilat. At the end of infusion, plasma ANP and cGMP were elevated both after (S)-thiorphan and after alatrioprilat, whereas plasma renin activity increased only after alatrioprilat. The ACE inhibition effect was studied in ganglion-blocked rats receiving a continous infusion of angiotensin I. Alatrioprilat decreased the mean blood pressure dose-dependently, but about 30 times higher concentrations were needed to produce the same effects as the ACE inhibitor captopril. At a dose of 30 mg/kg p.o., ecadotril, the orally active prodrug of (S)-thiorphan, decreased the systolic blood pressure in conscious TGR by 22 mmHg for 6 h, whereas alatriopril (100 mg/kg p.o.) also reduced the systolic pressure in these rats with a maximal reduction of 22 mmHg. In addition, ecadotril and alatriopril significantly increased the urinary excretion of sodium. In contrast, ACE inhibition with captopril decreased the excretion of sodium dose-dependently in conscious TGR. In conclusion, combined ACE/NEP inhibition produced a comparable lowering of blood pressure and improvement in renal function as those with NEP inhibition in TGR. Dual ACE/NEP inhibition may therefore be useful in cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension or heart failure.", 
    "296": "Recognition of the existence of circadian variation in exacerbation of cardiovascular disease may have relevance to clinical use of cardioactive agents. Physiologic rational for the chronobiology of cardiac disease exists and can provide a basis on which to examine the efficacy of agents to manage cardiac disease. The use of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices have advanced our ability to describe the interplay of chronobiologic rhythms and pharmacodynamic response to antihypertensive medications. This review summarizes the studies evaluating the use of various antihypertensive medications in the context of using 24-hour blood pressure monitoring devices. The studies are described in an attempt to increase awareness of chronobiology and potential implications of designing chronotherapeutic regimens.", 
    "297": "To determine whether prejunctional angiotensin II receptors facilitate norepinephrine (NE) release during exercise, normal volunteers exercised at approximately 25 or approximately 65% of maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) on two occasions. Steady-state NE kinetics were determined at rest and during exercise by using infusions of [3H]NE. Arterial plasma NE and [3H]NE were determined for calculation of NE spillover and clearance. Before the second bout of exercise at approximately 25% of VO2max later that day, enalaprilat (n = 8) or nitroprusside (n = 5) was administered intravenously to lower blood pressure to a comparable level and saline was infused as a time control (n = 4). Exercise at 25% of VO2max increased heart rate from 73 to 100 beats/min, plasma NE from 296 to 626 pg/ml, and NE spillover from 1.56 to 3.32 nmol.min-1.m-2. The exercise effect was significant in each subgroup. At rest and during exercise, the decrease in blood pressure and the increase in plasma NE and NE spillover were similar with enalaprilat and nitroprusside. There was no drug effect in the saline group. In a separate group (n = 7), exercise at approximately 65% of VO2max increased heart rate from 76 to 170 beats/min, plasma NE from 338 to 2,656 pg/ml, and NE spillover from 1.87 to 11.65 nmol.min-1.m-2. In this group, 3 days of oral enalapril did not affect the NE spillover response to exercise. Because the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor did not attenuate the NE spillover response to exercise, we conclude that at the exercise levels tested, prejunctional angiotensin II receptors do not appear to facilitate NE release.", 
    "298": "We used the captopril test (CT) in 32 children, 8 with renovascular hypertension (RVH), 17 with renal hypertension (RH) and 7 with normal blood pressure, in order to study the renin-angiotensin system activation (RASA). All children affected by RVH presented a positive CT: a post-captopril plasma renin activity (PRA) of 12 ng ml-1 h-1 or more, an absolute PRA increase of 10 ng ml-1 h-1 or more and a 150% increase or more, or 400% or more if the baseline PRA was less than 3 ng ml-1 h-1. The CT may be useful for demonstrating the RASA in RVH.", 
    "299": "Clinical trials continue to evaluate the pharmacologic management of myocardial infarction for benefits in mortality, degree of infarct artery patency, and frequency of reocclusion. The discovery of thrombus formation in the development of the myocardial infarction renewed interest in thrombolytic therapy. In appropriate candidates, timely administration of thrombolytics after myocardial infarction restores coronary artery patency, reduces myocardial ischemic damage, and improves left ventricular function. Adjunct therapy for thrombolysis typically includes aspirin, heparin, beta-blockers, nitroglycerin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, if not contraindicated. To reduce cardiac risk, postthrombolysis management generally includes aspirin. beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors together with efforts to reduce known cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "300": "Despite the availability of safe and efficacious antihypertensive agents, hypertension continues to be a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Losartan, the first of a new class of agents, the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, can be administered as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension or to complement existing therapy. The angiotensin II receptor antagonists block the effects of angiotensin II through preferential binding to angiotensin II receptor subtype AT1 on the cell membrane. Compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, they may provide more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and be associated with a lower frequency of cough as a side effect.", 
    "301": "1. The effects of antagonism of the maternal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with either an angiotensin II type 1-(AT1) specific receptor blocker (GR138950) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril) were compared in chronically-catheterised ewes and their foetuses during late gestation. 2. Daily from 127 +/- 1 days of gestation until parturition at 145 +/- 2 days, each ewe received i.v. either GR138950 (3 mg kg-1; n = 10), captopril (3 mg kg-1; n = 6) or an equivalent volume of vehicle solution (0.9% w/v saline; n = 10). 3. Within 2 h of drug administration, GR138950 abolished the maternal, but not the foetal, pressor responses to angiotensin II (AII; 100-188 ng kg-1, i.v.; P < 0.05), whereas captopril abolished both the maternal and foetal pressor responses to angiotensin I (AI; 400-750 ng kg-1, i.v.; P < 0.05). 4. On the first day of treatment, maternal blood pressure decreased in all GR138950-treated (-21 +/- 4 mmHg; P < 0.05) and captopril-treated (-13 +/- 5 mmHg; P > 0.05) ewes at 2 h after drug administration. Captopril also significantly decreased foetal blood pressure by 5 +/- 1 mmHg (P < 0.05). However, foetal blood pressure in the GR138950-treated animals remained unchanged. Maternal and foetal heart rates were unaffected by any treatment. Uterine blood flow was significantly reduced within 2 h of both GR138950 (-130 +/- 20 ml min-1; P < 0.05) and captopril (-72 +/- 16 ml min-1; P < 0.05) administration. 5. On the first day of treatment, maternal arterial haemoglobin (Hb) concentration and oxygen (O2) content increased at 2 h in all GR138950-treated and captopril-treated ewes. Foetal arterial pH and oxygenation (O2 content, O2 saturation and Pao2) were reduced by a similar extent in both groups of drug-treated ewes. 6. After one week of daily GR138950 administration, maternal blood pressure decreased from a pretreatment value of 96 +/- 5 mmHg on day 1 to 79 +/- 2 mmHg by day 7 (P < 0.05). Captopril treatment had no long-term effect on maternal blood pressure. Although foetal blood pressure increased by 3 +/- 1 mmHg over a week of vehicle treatment (P < 0.05), no significant differences were observed between the long-term changes in foetal blood pressure in all three groups of animals. 7. There were no long-term effects of drug administration on maternal Hb concentration or oxygenation, or on the foetal haematological parameters. However, changes in maternal PaCo2 observed in the GR138950-treated (+1.4 +/- 0.5 mmHg; P < 0.05) and captopril-treated (+3.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg; P > 0.05) ewes were significantly different from those seen in the vehicle-treated animals (P < 0.05). 8. There were no apparent adverse effects of maternal GR138950 or captopril treatment on foetal viability. 9. The present study demonstrated that administration of either GR138950 or captopril to pregnant ewes effectively blocked the maternal RAS, and caused hypotension and a decrease in uterine blood flow. However, only captopril appeared to cross the placenta to influence directly the RAS of the sheep foetus. This suggests that the fall in foetal oxygenation observed after AT1-specific receptor blockade and ACE inhibition originates primarily from changes in the maternal and/or placental vasculature. Despite these changes, neither GR138950 nor captopril were detrimental to the outcome of pregnancy when foetal blood loss was kept to a minimum.", 
    "302": "1. We tested the effects on systemic haemodynamics and renal function, of inhibition of endopeptidase (EP) 24.15 (E.C. 3.4.24.15), in conscious uninephrectomized rabbits in which the activities of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, E.C. 3.4.15.1) and neutral endopeptidase (EP 24.11, E.C. 3.4.24.11) were already inhibited. To test the role of bradykinin B2-receptors in mediating the effects following inhibition of these enzymes, the antagonist Hoe 140 was used. 2. Hoe 140 (0.1 mg kg-1, i.v.) did not affect resting mean arterial pressure or heart rate, but antagonized the depressor effect of right atrial administration of bradykinin. The dose-response curve for bradykinin was shifted more than 1000 fold to the right for more than 4 h. Hoe 140 approximately doubled resting urine flow and increased fractional Na+ excretion from 4.2 to 6.0%; consistent with the hypothesis that it exerts a partial agonist effect on the kidney. 3. Combined inhibition of ACE (captopril; 0.25 mg kg-1 plus 0.2 mg kg-1h-1) and EP 24.11 (SCH 39370; 3 mg kg-1 plus 3 mg kg-1h-1) was followed by a sustained reduction in arterial pressure (-6 +/- 2 mmHg) and increase in heart rate (35 +/- 7 beats min-1). There was a small increase in renal blood flow (by 6.5 +/- 3.2% relative to vehicle-treatment) without a change in glomerular filtration rate, and about a 150% increase in Na+ excretion. Hoe 140 (0.1 mg kg-1, i.v.) pretreatment did not influence the renal effects of captopril and SCH 39370, although it did appear to blunt their hypotensive and tachycardic effects. 4. When EP 24.15 was inhibited with N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (cFP-AAY-pAB; 5 mg kg-1 plus 3 mg kg-1h-1, i.v.) in rabbits pretreated with captopril and SCH 39370, no changes in systemic haemodynamics or renal function were observed. 5. We concluded that in conscious uninephrectomized rabbits, EP 24.15 does not play a major role in modulating renal function, at least under conditions where ACE and EP 24.11 are already inhibited. In contrast, ACE and/or EP 24.11 do modulate renal function in this model, but their influences are mediated chiefly through metabolism of peptides other than bradykinin.", 
    "303": "Although heart failure secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction remains a serious disease with high morbidity and mortality, pharmacologic intervention has been shown to be associated with improved survival and a decreased number of hospitalizations. Primary-care providers must be aware of the potential benefits of recent therapeutic advances and current treatment recommendations for patients with heart failure to receive optimal care. Important aspects of nonpharmacologic care are dietary restrictions, exercise training, and through patient education and counseling. Pharmacologic therapy includes diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and other vasodilating agents, and digoxin. ACE inhibitors are currently recommended for all patients with left ventricular dysfunction in whom use of these agents is not contraindicated. The mortality and morbidity from heart failure even with ACE inhibitors remain high, however. Promising clinical findings with such investigational agents as vesnarinone and pimobendan and the new-generation beta-blocker carvedilol suggest future new treatments to further improve the prognosis of these patients.",

Selection of subjects in the first study was restricted to those receiving a discharge diagnosis of congestive heart failure and in the second study to subjects receiving a discharge diagnosis of hypertension. In each of these 2 studies, a single case group was selected along with 2 control groups: a psychiatric control group consisting of subjects receiving a psychiatric diagnosis other than a depressive disorder and a nonpsychiatric control group receiving no psychiatric diagnoses. Drug exposures and other variables were recorded from a chart review.",

    "308": "The effect of administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, alacepril, on 24-hour blood pressure in the elderly hypertensive patients was investigated. Thirteen elderly hypertensive patients (mean age 71 +/- 5; 6 male and 7 female) participated in the present study. After 2 weeks of control period alacepril was administered 25-50 mg/day for 8 weeks. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring with cuff-oscillometric method was performed at the end of both control and treatment periods. Alacepril administration for 8 weeks significantly decreased 24-hour blood pressure while it had little effect on heart rate. Daytime blood pressure was significantly decreased from 154 +/- 10/91 +/- 5 mmHg to 145 +/- 8/85 +/- 5 mmHg, while the change in nocturnal blood pressure was not significant: from 137 +/- 17/79 +/- 7 mmHg to 130 +/- 15/75 +/- 9 mmHg. Hyperbaric area of systolic blood pressure was also significantly decreased (from 295 +/- 185 mmHg x hour/day to 172 +/- 111 mmHg x hour/day), indicating that pressure load to the heart was effectively reduced. Administration of alacepril did not cause tachycardia in response to the decrease in blood pressure. Acrophase of both blood pressure and heart rate was changed to 11:00 a.m. These findings indicate that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in the elderly hypertensive patients decreased blood pressure effectively without causing tachycardia or deterioration of diurnal variations of blood pressure. These hemodynamic changes produced by alacepril administration are favorable for the treatment of the elderly patients with cardiovascular disease.", 
    "309": "ACE inhibitors effectively reduce systemic vascular resistance in patients with hypertension, heart failure or chronic renal disease. This antihypertensive efficacy probably accounts for an important part of their long term renoprotective effects in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease. The renal mechanisms underlying the renal adverse effects of ACE inhibitors--intrarenal efferent vasodilation with a consequent fall in filtration pressure--are held to be involved in their renoprotective effects as well. The fall in filtration pressure presumably contributes to the antiproteinuric effect as well as to long term renoprotection. The former is suggested by the positive correlation between the fall in filtration fraction and the reduction in proteinuria found during ACE inhibition. The latter is suggested by the correlation between the (slight) reduction in glomerular filtration rate at onset of therapy and a more favourable course of renal function in the long term. Such a fall in filtration rate at the onset of ACE inhibitor treatment is reversible after withdrawal, and can be considered the trade-off for long term renal protection in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic chronic renal disease. In conditions in which glomerular filtration is critically dependent on angiotensin II-mediated efferent vascular tone (such as a post-stenotic kidney, or patients with heart failure and severe depletion of circulating volume), ACE inhibition can induce acute renal failure, which is reversible after withdrawal of the drug. Systemic and renal haemodynamic effects of ACE inhibition, both beneficial and adverse, are potentiated by sodium depletion. Consequently, sodium repletion contributes to the restoration of renal function in patients with ACE inhibitor-induced acute renal failure. Our the other hand, co-treatment with diuretics and sodium restriction can improve therapeutic efficacy in patients in whom the therapeutic response of blood pressure or proteinuria is insufficient. Patients at the greatest risk for renal adverse effects (those with heart failure, diabetes mellitus and/or chronic renal failure) also can expect the greatest benefit. Therefore, ACE inhibitors should not be withheld in these patients, but dosages should be carefully titrated, with monitoring of renal function and serum potassium levels.",

There was bilateral parenchymal retention of the tracer suggesting renal artery stenosis. Angiography confirmed bilateral renal artery stenosis and also demonstrated contour irregularities of the abdominal aorta, and stenosis in mesenteric and subclavian arteries with increased collateral circulation consistent with Takayasu's arteritis. In light of this case of renal artery stenosis, it was concluded that Tc-99m EC can be used successfully as a potential renal agent in the diagnosis of renal involvement in patients with Takayasu's arteritis.",

Captopril was stabilized by forming an adduct with p-bromophenacyl bromide. The adduct formed and 4-chloro-2-nitroaniline (internal standard) were extracted with ethyl acetate:benzene (1:1), and then measured by HPLC using a Spherisorb C18 column as stationary phase and a water:acetonitrile:acetic acid mixture (44:55:0.2, v/v/v) as mobile phase. Captopril was quantified by absorbance at 258 nm. The method proved to be linear in the clinical range of 5-500 ng/mL. The lower limit of detection of captopril in plasma was 2 ng/mL. Intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation of assay for captopril in plasma were 5.8%-8.5% (n = 7) and 8.0%-9.5% (n = 5), respectively. The recoveries of captopril were 90%-98% for plasma. The data obtained was fitted with 3P87 program on computer to study the pharmacokinetics. The results showed that the disposition of captopril was conformed to a two-compartment open model with Tmax = 0.56 h, Cmax = 266.5 ng/mL and AUC(zero)-infinity = 380.3 ng.h/mL.

Fifty patients with hypertension < or = 160/100 mm Hg, aged < or = 50 years, normal two-dimensional echocardiographic (2-D echo) measurements, and LVDD were enrolled in this study. The LVDD was defined as a transmitral early (E) to atrial (A) peak velocity ratio of < or = 1. The mean documented hypertension was 6.3 years. The mean daily dose of enalapril was 13 mg. Baseline and 24-month follow-up echocardiograms were evaluated. Thirty-eight age- and sex-matched healthy subjects served to establish the normal reference values of 2-D echo measurements. After treatment, peak early diastolic velocity (E) (49 +/- 6 cm/sec v 48 +/- 10 cm/sec; P = not significant), peak atrial velocity (A) (62 +/- 9 cm/sec v 62 +/- 10 cm/sec; P = not significant), and E/A ratio (0.80 +/- 0.10 v 0.78 +/- 0.13; P = not significant) remained unchanged. Moreover, early to atrial velocity-time integral ratio (1.24 +/- 0.08 v 1.23 +/- 0.11; P = not significant) did not change. The left ventricular mass index, relative wall thickness, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left atrial diameter, fractional shortening, heart rate, and body mass index did not show significant changes in all hypertensive patients. In conclusion, long-term antihypertensive therapy with enalapril did not lead to an improvement of LVDD in young and mild hypertension patients without concomitant LVH.", 
    "318": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, angiotensin II (AII) AT1-receptor blockade, and dihydropyridine calcium antagonism on hypertrophy and on vascular albumin permeability in kidney, heart, and mesenteric artery in a model combining genetic hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus was induced by streptozotocin in 8-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats. The animals were randomized to receive no treatment, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, the AII AT1-receptor blocker valsartan, or the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist lacidipine for 3 weeks. Vascular albumin permeability was measured as the tissue content of intravenously injected Evans blue dye (EB) in kidney, heart, and mesenteric artery and the tissue/plasma EB ratio was calculated. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by all three antihypertensive regimens. Glycemic control was similar in all diabetic groups. Kidney hypertrophy was not affected by any of the antihypertensive drugs. Hypertrophy of the mesenteric artery was enhanced by lacidipine but was not affected by ramipril or valsartan. Relative heart weight was also increased by lacidipine. Vascular albumin permeability, expressed as EB content in micrograms/gram dry weight or as tissue/plasma EB ratio, was higher in the kidneys of lacidipine-treated rats than in any other group of diabetic rats. There was a positive correlation between kidney weight/body weight and kidney/plasma EB ratio in the diabetic rats. These findings indicate that the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist lacidipine is associated with an unfavorable effect on vascular hypertrophy and on vascular albumin permeability in the kidneys in rats with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, there seems to be a coupling in the diabetic kidney between hypertrophy and increased vascular albumin permeability.", 
    "319": "Quality of life is an important attribute of antihypertensive therapy. Previous studies have not addressed the importance of a patient's prior pharmacotherapy on quality of life, which may serve as the basis of reference for a new therapy. Nor have previous studies compared commonly used quality of life instruments for consistency, or investigated whether improvement or worsening of quality of life correlates with adverse events or blood pressure reduction. Two hundred eighteen hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure (95 to 114 mm Hg) after a 4- to 5-week placebo washout period were enrolled in a randomized double-blind, parallel group dose-escalation trial to compare the effects of amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg), bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg)/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 6.25, and enalapril (5 to 20 mg) on blood pressure, adverse events, and quality of life. Three quality of life instruments (General Well-Being Index, Vital Signs Quality of Life, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) were administered during original therapy, after placebo washout, and after 12 weeks of optimally titrated clinical trial pharmacotherapy. Our results demonstrated that removal from prior therapy had no detectable influence on subsequent evaluation of quality of life. The three quality of life instruments were consistent with the changes observed with the three therapies: a trend toward better quality of life with amlodipine and bisoprolol/HCTZ. Adverse events, but not systolic or diastolic blood pressure reduction correlated directly with changes in quality of life.", 
    "320": "Antihypertensive treatment is known to slow down the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with time. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to be more effective in this regard than conventional antihypertensive therapy. In a recent prospective, randomized, double blind trial in 257 patients with essential hypertension, the loss of GFR, determined with 51Cr-EDTA clearance, was significantly less with an ACE inhibitor (cilazapril) than with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (atenolol) during the first year of treatment. However, after 2 years, the two therapies were equally effective in this regard, thereby creating doubts about the long-term superiority of ACE inhibition in this regard. In order to elucidate whether the superior renal preservation with the ACE inhibitor was a transient effect, GFR was measured after 1 more year of treatment, i.e., after 36 months. At that time, the decline in GFR was significantly smaller in the ACE inhibitor group as compared to the beta-adrenoceptor blocker group (-3.0 [-5.5, -1.0; 95% CI] v -7.0 [-9.0, -4.5; 95% CI] mL/min x 1.73 m2; P = .026). This demonstrates that in the treatment of essential hypertension ACE inhibition preserves GFR significantly better than beta-adrenoceptor blockade during long-term therapy.", 
    "321": "In a previous placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study performed in 6 healthy volunteers, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single oral administration of two doses (5 and 20 mg) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), lisinopril. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relation between lisinopril plasma concentrations (C, ng/ml), and lisinopril-induced effects on plasma converting enzyme activity (PCEA, nmol/ml/min), brachial artery flow (BAF, ml/min), and brachial vascular resistance (BVR, mm Hg . s/ml). PCEA and BVR were expressed in percent changes from initial values and BAF was expressed in absolute values. Effects (E) were related to C by the Hill model: E = Emax . C gamma/CE50 gamma + C gamma). For PCEA, the model was fitted to the data of both doses simultaneously. Emax was fixed at -100%, and we obtained (mean +/- SD) CE50 = 1.4 +/- 0.6 ng/ml and gamma = 0.6 +/- 0.1. For BAF and BVR, the model was fitted to the data of the 20-mg dose for 5 subjects and to those of the 5-mg dose for 1 subject. We obtained Emax = 45 +/- 20 ml/min, CE50 = 24.0 +/- 12.4 ng/ml, and gamma = 3.2 +/- 1.3 for BAF, and Emax = -45 +/- 15%, CE50 = 22.0 +/- 10.2 ng/ml, and gamma = 3.1 +/- 1.1 for BVR. Therefore, the concentration-effect relations for BVR (or BAF) and PCEA display quite different shapes (CE50, gamma), which emphasizes the necessity of performing pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling on hemodynamic parameters to determine the optimal dosages of ACEIs.", 
    "322": "We compared the effect of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists on the circadian blood pressure (BP) profile in essential hypertension. We reviewed all studies published between 1980 and August 1993 reporting the circadian efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and using ambulatory BP monitoring. In all, 815 patients with essential hypertension were assessed in 51 studies of eight different beta-blockers, six ACE inhibitors, and eight calcium antagonists. As main outcome measures, relative (percentage) BP reductions during the day and at night were compared between the three classes of antihypertensive drugs. Results were also separated for different dosing schemes (once and more than once daily). With all three classes of antihypertensive agents, the percentage night BP reduction was approximately 1-3% less as compared with percentage reductions during the day. Only for systolic BP (SBP) of the calcium antagonists administered once daily was this difference significant [2.2%, confidence interval (CI) 0.3-4.0%, p < 0.05], due to a higher statistical power in this group of agents. Our results show that beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium antagonists are comparably effective during the day and at night, and no evidence indicates that either of the three agents is preferable to obtain the best possible antihypertensive effect at night.", 
    "323": "The depressor and renal responses to C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) were determined in conscious cynomolgus monkeys treated with vehicle or inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The NEP inhibitor SQ 28603 (100 mumol/kg intravenously, i.v.) significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the depressor responses to 1 and 10 nmol/ kg i.v. CNP from -2 +/- 3 to -22 +/- 10 mm Hg and from -16 +/- 4 to -66 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively. SQ 28603 also significantly increased the cyclic GMP responses to 1 and 10 nmol/kg CNP from 1.4 +/- 1.6 to 11.0 +/- 2.0 nmol/2 h and from 4.2 +/- 0.5 to 53.3 +/- 12.1 nmol/2 h, respectively. Furthermore, the NEP inhibitor significantly increased the natriuretic activity of 1 and 10 nmol/kg i.v. CNP from 235 +/- 99 to 760 +/- 60 microEq/2 h and from 399 +/- 208 to 1,036 +/- 79 microEq/2 h, respectively. A positive correlation between the cumulative natriuretic and cyclic GMP responses suggested a cyclic GMP-mediated mechanism. These data are consistent with the protection of CNP from degradation by renal NEP. Inhibition of ACE by 100 mumol/kg i.v. captopril did not significantly alter the depressor or renal activities of 1 nmol/kg of CNP, neither did it alter the potentiation of CNP activity by SQ 28603. The potentiation of the depressor, cyclic GMP, and natriuretic responses to CNP in nonhuman primates by SQ 28603 suggested that NEP is an important mechanism for in vivo inactivation of natriuretic peptides, including CNP.", 
    "324": "Previous studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs attenuate the progression of proteinuria by their treatments from young age, but few have examined their effects on impaired renal function in older age. In the present study the calcium antagonists efonidipine ((+/-)-2-[benzyl (phenyl)amino]ethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-(5,5-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,3, 2-dioxaphosphorinan-2-yl)-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-3-pyridinecarboxyla te hydrochloride ethanol, CAS 111011-76-8, NZ-105) and nicardipine, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, were examined for their effects on heavy proteinuria in aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Efonidipine (20 mg/kg), nicardipine (20 mg/kg) and captopril (30 mg/kg) were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. The urinary protein excretion (UproE) increased with age (54.9 mg/kg/day at 24 weeks of age to 170.8 mg/kg/day at 36 weeks). The increased UproE was significantly suppressed by daily administration of efonidipine or captopril as compared to that in the non drug treated control group. The UproE in the nicardipine group was maintained at a slightly lower level than in the control. The histological examination showed that the damages of the kidneys were slightly suppressed by efonidipine and captopril. These findings indicate that efonidipine as well as captopril reduce proteinuria in aged SHR and the effect was stronger than that of nicardipine. This beneficial effect of efonidipine on proteinuria suggests its usefulness in antihypertensive therapy.",

Clinicians should titrate the chosen ACE inhibitor on the basis of hemodynamic response to target doses used in major clinical trials.

    "330": "The aim of the present study was to analyse quantitatively, on a cat gastrocnemius muscle preparation in vivo, the effects of local angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by enalaprilat on total regional vascular resistance (tone) and its distribution to the large-bore arterial resistance vessels (> 25 microns), the small arterioles (< 25 microns) and the veins. Associated effects on capillary pressure and fluid exchange were also studied. Close-arterial infusion of enalaprilat (0.05-0.20 mg kg muscle tissue min-1) elicited a moderate dilator response in all three consecutive sections of the muscle vascular bed, an increase in capillary pressure and transcapillary fluid filtration. This dilation could be abolished by the selective bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (2 mg kg-1 min-1, i.a.), indicating that the dilator mechanism of ACE inhibition was an increased local concentration of bradykinin, and hardly at all a decreased concentration of angiotensin (AT) II. The generalized dilator response to ACE inhibition along the vascular bed suggested a relatively uniform distribution of ACE from artery to vein and this was further supported by the finding that a close-arterial infusion of AT I (0.04-0.32 microgram kg-1 min-1), which was vasoactive only after conversion to AT II by local ACE, elicited a generalized constrictor response in all three vascular sections. In contrast, infused AT II (0.01-0.16 microgram kg-1 min-1) constricted almost selectively the large-bore arterial vessels. The specific angiotensin AT1-receptor antagonist losartan (2 mg kg-1 min-1, i.a.) abolished the constrictor response to AT II but did not affect vascular tone under control conditions, indicating that AT II is not involved in the initiation of basal vascular tone in muscle. These results, taken together, indicate that under basal conditions vascular ACE contributes to the local control of vascular tone in skeletal muscle by degrading the endogenous dilator bradykinin, and not by converting AT I into vasoconstrictor AT II.", 
    "331": "To delineate the pathogenesis of the reduction in hemoglobin occurring in renal transplant patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and azathioprine (AZA) a controlled, prospective trial of ACEI withdrawal was conducted. The ACEI was replaced by nifedipine or clonidine in 15 kidney transplant patients immunosuppressed with AZA and prednisone (enalapril in 14 and captopril in 1). Before and during 10 to 12 weeks after withdrawal of the ACEI, AZA metabolites, renal function parameters and hematological parameters including erythropoietin and reticulocytes were evaluated. Enalaprilat levels were measured and compared with 15 similar patients matched for transplant function and enalapril dosage immunosuppressed with cyclosporine and prednisone. AZA metabolites did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of the ACEI. Enalaprilat levels also showed no significant difference between the two patient groups treated with AZA or cyclosporine. Hematocrit and hemoglobin increased significantly from 37.5 +/- 6.4 to 39.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SD, P = 0.02) and 12.8 +/- 2.2 to 13.5 +/- 1.2 g/dl, P = 0.04, respectively, 10 to 12 weeks after ACEI treatment had been discontinued. Simultaneously numbers of reticulocytes and erythropoietin concentrations rose significantly after 2, 4 and 10 weeks, with a peak at two weeks (from 14.1 +/- 3.8 to 20.6 +/- 8.0/1000, P < 0.05 and from 14.3 +/- 12.4 to 29.3 +/- 54.5 mU/ml, P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, ACEI-related anemia in renal transplant recipients seems to be due to the erythropoietin-lowering effect of this group of drugs. A pharmacokinetic interaction between AZA and enalapril is not likely since plasma enalaprilat levels were independent of the immunosuppressive regimen and AZA metabolite levels were unchanged in the presence and absence of the ACEI. Several mechanisms by which angiotensin converting enzyme blockade may cause a decrease in circulating erythropoietin are discussed.", 
    "332": "The selection of the most appropriate therapy for hypertension remains a controversial issue. Little information is available regarding the prescribing patterns of antihypertensives in the primary care setting in Israel. The use of antihypertensives in 200 patients of the Maccabi Health Fund was, therefore, examined from April to June 1994. Sixty-four per cent of patients received monotherapy and 36% combination therapy. The most commonly prescribed medication for monotherapy were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (33.6%), followed by beta-blockers (28.1%) and calcium channel antagonists (26.6%). Diuretics were prescribed to 7.0% of the patients. Analysis of overall drug utilization showed that diuretics were used in 21.5% of patients, beta-blockers in 39.5%, calcium channel blockers in 46% and ACE inhibitors in 40% of patients. Despite the growing evidence of the benefits of diuretics and beta-blockers, our results show a low utilization of these agents in comparison to other countries. It may be speculated that the lack of national guidelines, the absence of utilization reviews by third party providers as well as differences in patient population and climate conditions may all contribute to the current prescribing habits of physicians in the Israeli community.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different antihypertensive agents in the treatment of patients with hypertensive crises. 168 patients (mean age: 52 +/- 12 years) admitted to the emergency department with a hypertensive urgency (systolic (SBP) blood pressure > 210 mm Hg and/or diastolic (DBP) blood pressure > 110 mm Hg) or a hypertensive emergency (DBP > 100 mm Hg and evidence of end-organ damage) were included into the study protocol. Blood pressure (BP) was measured every 5 min automatically using a noninvasive BP measurement unit.

The aim of treatment was to reduce SBP below 180 mm Hg and DBP below 95 mm Hg within 45 min after start of treatment. When evaluating the response rates the highest rate was observed in the urapidil group (96%). The response rate of enalaprilat and both preparations of nifedipine were similar (70-72%). The rate of major side effects was higher in the urapidil compared to the other drugs (4% vs 2% in the nifedipine-group or 0% in the enalaprilat-group). All four drugs are suitable in the treatment of patients with hypertensive crisis in the emergency department. Urapidil should be used as a first choice drug in critically ill patients with hypertensive crisis due to its higher response rate.",

    "351": "Many cardiovascular drugs have been implicated as causes of depression. With the exception of beta-blockers, few have been studied in formal epidemiologic designs. I present a new approach to such analyses that effectively controls for confounders that are stable over time. I analyzed the exposure histories of 11,244 incident antidepressant users, using the Odense University PharmacoEpidemiologic Database. All persons starting both beta-blockers and antidepressants during a predefined period were identified. If beta-blockers do not cause depression, this particular population should show equal numbers of persons starting either drug first. A depression-provoking effect of beta-blockers would generate an excess of persons starting beta-blockers first, that is a nonsymmetrical distribution of prescription orders. Confounders causing the two drugs to be co-prescribed would rarely be expected to affect the symmetry. The initial screening showed nonsymmetrical prescription orders for a wide range of cardiovascular drugs. After adjustment for an increasing incidence of antidepressant prescribing, I found a depression-provoking effect only for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (rate ratio = 1.29; 95% confidence interval = 1.08-1.56) and calcium channel blockers (rate ratio = 1.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.14-1.51).

    "352": "To determine the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on cardiovascular remodeling in a pressure overload model of cardiac hypertrophy, a subdiaphragmatic aortic band was placed in adult male, Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were left untreated (AB) or given captopril (Cap, 400 mg/l) (AB-Cap). Sham-operated controls were either left untreated (S) or given Cap (S-Cap). After 4 wk, rats were catheterized, and carotid and femoral mean arterial pressures (CMAP and FMAP in mmHg, respectively) were recorded. Hearts were isolated, and minimal coronary resistance (MCR) was determined. Hearts were then perfusion fixed, total and regional heart weights were recorded, and sections were processed for vessel morphology. Changes in coronary artery medical thickness and perivascular fibrosis were assessed by quantitative image analysis. CMAP was significantly higher in AB and AB-Cap than S or S-Cap rats (P < 0.05). There was no difference in FMAP in AB vs. S rats, but AB-Cap and S-Cap had lower FMAP values than S rats. Total heart weight and left ventricular weight-to-body weight ratios were increased in AB and AB-Cap rats compared with S and S-Cap rats (P < 0.05). MCR of AB was greater than S and S-Cap rats. MCR of AB-Cap rats was significantly greater than S and S-Cap rats but was significantly less than AB rats. In coronary vessels, medial thickness was greatest in AB, whereas there was no difference among AB-Cap, S, and S-Cap rats. Similarly, the increase in perivascular fibrosis was greatest in AB rats, and there was no difference among AB-Cap, S, and S-Cap rats. These data suggest that the RAS, independent of increased arterial pressure, is critical for the development of the vascular and fibrotic changes that occur in this model of pressure overload hypertrophy.", 
    "353": "Role of ACE inhibitors in the management of asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is well established. More recently, large clinical trials have evaluated the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors early after AMI, ie, within 24 hours of symptom onset. This concept has emerged with the understanding of pathophysiological changes occurring after AMI. Neurohormonal activation and ventricular remodelling after AMI form the basis of these changes, whereas the extent of LV dysfunction remains strongly predictive of poor outcome. The large clinical trials with mortality end point have shown modest benefit with early use of ACE inhibitors in an unselected population. However, the generalized use of ACE inhibitors remains controversial because of an overall small benefit. We review the pathophysiological changes occurring after AMI, the rationale for early use of ACE inhibitors, and the data available from the large clinical trials. We recommend consideration of early ACE inhibitor in all but the lowest risk patients. Clinical features of such a low-risk population would include small and nonanterior infarctions in patients less than 65 years of age and with LV ejection fractions greater than 50%. Objective assessment of LV function is warranted during hospitalization for AMI to appropriately select patients for ACE inhibitor therapy. Dosing should be started carefully to avoid hypotension and should be titrated to the goal of doses used in the large trials. Duration of therapy in patients at high risk for death or ventricular enlargement should be indefinite. Further large-scale secondary prevention trials with long-term treatment are underway to assess the effect of ACE inhibition on coronary disease progression and reinfarction.",

The changes can be due to an alteration in vessel diameter or in the number of small blood vessels. In this study, the effects of prolonged administration of different blockers of the renin angiotensin system on the microcirculation of the cutaneous maximus muscle of young spontaneously hypertensive rats were determined by using the dorsal microcirculatory chamber model. Animals were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) benazeprilat (3 mg/kg/d) or the specific angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan (3 mg/kg/d) for 4 weeks.

Microvascular diameters and density were measured before and during the drug treatment and compared with those in the control group. There was no significant effect of either of the drug treatments on vascular diameters when compared with the control group for any vessel type (arterioles or venules). In contrast, there was a significant decrease in small arteriolar and venular density and in large venular density after treatment with the ACE inhibitor, whereas the angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist had no significant effect. The data do not suggest a role for angiotensin II in the long-term control of striated muscle microvascular tone. However, angiotensin II may be involved in microvascular growth via a non-AT1 receptor-mediated mechanism, or other vasoactive peptides degraded by ACE may contribute to the effects of the ACE inhibitor.", 
    "355": "Periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion of the ischemic tissue are associated with myocardial damage and ventricular arrhythmia. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors limit the occurrence of these arrhythmias. The protective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be due to inhibition of bradykinin (BK) degradation, rather than inhibition of angiotensin II formation. Other enzymes which catabolize BK include the endopeptidases EP24.11 and EP24.15. The purpose of this study was to determine if inhibitors of EP24.11 and EP24.15 decrease ischemia/reperfusion injury and if this protection is mediated by BK receptors. Rabbits were anesthetized and prepared for recording of cardiovascular parameters. The chest was opened and a left ventricular artery occluded for 30 min, followed by a 2-hr reperfusion period. Infarct size was determined using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining immediately after reperfusion. The enzyme inhibitors, ramiprilat, N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Phe-pAB, and N[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-pAb, singly and in combinations were administered 3 min before reperfusion. Compared to saline (32.1 +/- 2.1), ramiprilat (18.3 +/- 2.8) and the EP inhibitors (14.4 +/- 1.4 for the combination) significantly decreased infarct size, with the greatest decrease occurring when all three inhibitors were combined (10.6 +/- 1.5). The protective effect of the EP inhibitors was blocked by the BK2 receptor antagonist, HOE 140 (30.1 +/- 2.6). Enzyme assays demonstrated EP24.11 and EP24.15 in the rabbit heart. We conclude that the EP inhibitors decreased ischemia/reperfusion injury by protecting BK from metabolism and that a combination of inhibitors provides superior protection to that given by a single agent.",

The retinal hemodynamic responses were analyzed using video-based fluorescein angiography (VFA) methodology.

The hyperoxic response in rats (n = 9) injected with 10(-4) M BQ-123 was significantly (P < 0.001) blunted compared to the group injected with vehicle alone. In contrast, intravitreal injection of saralasin, a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist, had no significant effect on the retinal response to hyperoxia (n = 5). Intravitreal phosphoramidon (10(-3) M, n = 6) injection also resulted in a significantly (P < 0.001) blunted circulatory response to hyperoxia compared to rats injected with vehicle alone. This blunted response after ECE inhibition was comparable to that measured after ETA receptor antagonism with BQ-123 injection.",

This study determined the structural benefit of captopril used preventively in radiation nephropathy. Twenty-eight Wag/RijMCW rats, divided in six groups, received 0 to 17 Gray total body irradiation followed by syngeneic bone marrow transplant. Captopril 0, 62.5, 125, 250, or 500 mg/l was given in the drinking water from the time of irradiation, and the rats were killed at 20 weeks. Using light and electron microscopy, kidneys of irradiated no-drug rats showed glomerular tuft capsular adhesions and hyalinization, focal tubular necrosis, severe interstitial fibrosis, and marked thickening and hyaline degeneration of the wall of interlobular arteries and arterioles, with intimal proliferation and periadventitial edema and inflammation. Lumens of the smaller arteries were often occluded. Significant collagen deposition was present in glomeruli, interstitium, and adventitia of interlobular arteries. Marked reduction of glomerular, tubular, vascular, and interstitial damage was seen in irradiated, captopril-treated animals, with only mild focal tubular interstitial injury and fibrosis seen. alpha smooth muscle actin-positive cells, probably myofibroblasts, were enhanced in the irradiated kidneys, and this expression was reduced in a dose-related fashion by captopril. There was also reduction in the arteriolar wall thickening, luminal occlusion, and collagen deposition in captopril-treated animals. The presence of elastin was not affected by radiation or drug treatment. Blood pressure and azotemia were lower and survival was higher in irradiated drug-treated rats compared with irradiated no-drug rats. We conclude that captopril exerts significant functional and structural protection against renal radiation injury. There was notable reduction in radiation-induced fibrosis in captopril-treated animals in this model, as in experimental lung radiation injury.",

Thus, treatment that causes dilation of the afferent arterioles in SHR may inhibit the redevelopment of high blood pressure when treatment is withdrawn. We treated SHR with an ACE inhibitor (cilazapril, 5 to 10 mg/kg per day, high; 1 mg/kg per day, low), a calcium antagonist (mibefradil, 20 to 30 mg/kg per day), and an endothelin receptor antagonist (bosentan, 100 mg/kg per day) from age 4 to 20 weeks. Untreated SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats were also investigated. At 20 weeks, the rats were killed, and morphology of the afferent arterioles was studied. Other SHR (untreated, high cilazapril, low cilazapril, mibefradil) were treated in exactly the same way and then followed to 32 weeks without treatment. The morphometric studies showed that cilazapril increased the lumen diameter in the afferent arterioles and decreased the media-lumen ratio in a dose-dependent manner. On withdrawal of cilazapril treatment, the reduction in blood pressure persisted. Mibefradil tended to increase afferent arteriolar diameter, whereas it did not alter media-lumen ratio. The persistent effect on blood pressure was only moderate after withdrawal of mibefradil. Bosentan had no effect on renal afferent arteriolar structure or blood pressure. In conclusion, cilazapril was more effective than mibefradil in altering afferent arteriolar structure and caused the most persistent effect on blood pressure after treatment withdrawal. The association of increased afferent arteriolar diameter and lower blood pressure level after withdrawal of treatment may suggest a pathogenic role for afferent arteriolar diameter in the development of high blood pressure in SHR.", 
    "366": "We treated with nifedipine or lisinopril 38 essential hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. The study had a single-blind crossover design; nifedipine or lisinopril was given for the first 24 weeks, and then patients were crossed over to the other antihypertensive agent for another 24 weeks. Both nifedipine and lisinopril significantly decreased mean arterial pressure to the same extent. Although lisinopril decreased left ventricular mass index more rapidly than nifedipine, 48 weeks of antihypertensive treatment with nifedipine or lisinopril reduced the extent of left ventricular hypertrophy to the same level. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy may be mainly due to a reduction in mean arterial pressure during the 24-week nifedipine treatment and due to an improvement of aortic compliance during the lisinopril treatment. Both nifedipine and lisinopril are effective in the reversal of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy; however, the agents have disparate actions on hemodynamic factors.", 
    "367": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is a common clinical feature in hypertensive patients and may be associated with structural changes in vessel morphology. In an open prospective trial, we evaluated 14 patients with previously untreated hypertension (163 +/- 2/104 +/- 2 mm Hg) and an echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass index of 141.6 +/- 5.2 g/m2, indicating left ventricular hypertrophy. We obtained a gluteal skin biopsy sample before starting treatment to investigate subcutaneous small-artery (approximately 200 to 400 microns diameter) morphology and function. Patients then received antihypertensive treatment with a combination of spirapril (3 or 6 mg) and isradipine (2.5 or 5 mg). Echocardiographic recordings were made after 6 months and 1 year, and a final biopsy was taken after 1 year. After 1 year, blood pressure was significantly reduced to 142 +/- 3/ 90 +/- 1 mm Hg (P < .001), and left ventricular mass index decreased significantly to 105.3 +/- 5.8 g/m2 (P < .001). Baseline media-lumen ratio (7.64 +/- 0.48%) was not markedly reduced (7.21 +/- 0.55%), although a decrease occurred in 7 of 12 evaluable patients. Norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction was markedly reduced after 1 year. In conclusion, a significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy was obtained after 1 year of treatment with spirapril and isradipine, whereas a similar reduction in medial thickness relative to lumen diameter of subcutaneous small arteries could not be observed in all patients. Reversal of structural changes in resistance vessels may require a longer treatment period in patients with proven left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "368": "Most of the biological effects of the renin-angiotensin system are mediated by the binding of angiotensin II (Ang II) to the type 1 Ang II (AT1) receptor, the predominant receptor subtype present after fetal life. To study tissue-specific regulation of the expression of the AT1 receptor in the rat, we altered activity of the renin-angiotensin system by feeding rats a low (0.07% NaCl), normal (0.3% NaCl), or high (7.5% NaCl) salt chow for 14 days; infusing Ang II (200 ng/kg per minute IP) or vehicle for 7 days; and administering an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 100 mg/dL in the drinking water) or vehicle for 7 days. Renin, angiotensinogen, and total AT1 receptor mRNA levels were measured by slot-blot hybridization with cRNA probes, and AT1 receptor subtypes (A and B) were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the presence of a cRNA internal standard. Plasma renin concentration and renal renin, renal and hepatic angiotensinogen, and hepatic AT1 receptor mRNA levels were all inversely related to salt intake; in contrast, renal AT1 receptor mRNA levels were significantly lower in rats fed low salt, a difference that was exclusively due to a decrease in the AT1A subtype. This difference did not appear to be mediated by a change in the circulating levels of Ang II, because Ang II infusion reduced plasma renin concentration and renal renin mRNA with no effect on either angiotensinogen or AT1 receptor mRNA levels in kidney or liver, renal Ang II receptor density (determined by in situ autoradiography) decreased, presumably via a posttranscriptional mechanism. Similarly, inhibition of Ang II generation with captopril increased plasma renin concentration and renal renin mRNA levels without altering renal or hepatic angiotensinogen mRNA or renal AT1 receptor mRNA levels. Thus, AT1 receptor gene expression is regulated in a tissue-specific manner that is distinct from other components of systemic and local renin-angiotensin systems and that appears to be mediated by a mechanism other than through changes in the circulating levels of Ang II.", 
    "369": "High blood pressure results in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, increased thickness and stiffness of large artery walls, and decreased renal function. The objective of our study was to assess the role of endothelin, angiotensin II, and high blood pressure in the end-organ damage observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). For this purpose, SHR were treated for 10 weeks with either a mixed endothelin-A and endothelin-B receptor antagonist, bosentan (100 mg/kg per day), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg/kg per day), or a long-acting calcium antagonist, mibefradil (20 mg/kg per day). A group of SHR was left untreated, and a group of normotensive Wistar rats was used as control. At the end of treatment, maximal coronary blood flow was measured in isolated perfused hearts. Cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, aortic medial thickness, and extracellular matrix content were evaluated by quantitative morphometry. Proteinuria and urea and creatinine clearances were measured, and renal histopathology was assessed. SHR exhibited cardiac hypertrophy, perivascular fibrosis, and decreased maximal coronary blood flow. Aortic medial thickness was increased, whereas elastin density was decreased. Finally, SHR showed decreased urinary excretion and decreased urea and creatinine clearances. No renal histological lesions were observed. Although bosentan did not affect blood pressure, it normalized renal function and slightly decreased left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis. Enalapril and mibefradil were both effective in significantly decreasing blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and aortic medial thickness and improving coronary blood flow, but in contrast to bosentan, they did not improve creatinine clearance. We conclude that in SHR, high blood pressure plays a major role in end-organ damage and that endothelin may partly mediate renal dysfunction and cardiac remodeling independently of a direct hemodynamic effect.", 
    "370": "Chronic administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) induces a rise in blood pressure that is prevented by angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor (type 1) blockade. Alterations in vascular reactivity in this model have not been extensively studied and could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of L-NAME-induced hypertension. In the present work, we aimed to study the vascular reactivity and cGMP content of aortic ring segments isolated from Wistar rats treated for 3 weeks with L-NAME or L-NAME plus the converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril. Quinapril prevented the rise in blood pressure in L-NAME-treated rats although acetylcholine-induced dilation in aortic rings was suppressed and sodium nitroprusside-induced dilation was increased in both L-NAME- and L-NAME plus quinapril-treated rats. In isolated aortic ring segments, chronic L-NAME decreased the contractile response to K+ (125 mmol/L), phenylephrine, angiotensin II, the G protein stimulator AlF4-, and the protein kinase C activator phorbol dibutyrate. In contrast to the upregulated sodium nitroprusside-induced dilation, the contractile capacity of the aorta in response to angiotensin II, phenylephrine, AlF4-, K+, and phorbol dibutyrate was restored by quinapril. Aortic cGMP was lowered in rats treated with L-NAME (530 +/- 120 fmol/mg protein, n = 12, P < .05) and L-NAME plus quinapril (461 +/- 140 fmol/mg protein, n = 12, P < .05) compared with controls (1798 +/- 522 fmol/mg protein, n = 12). We hypothesize that the continuous nitric oxide blockade by L-NAME might attenuate a continuous endogenous relaxing tone and is associated with an upregulated endogenous vasoconstrictor tone in large arteries. Converting enzyme inhibition interfered more with the increased endogenous constrictor tone than with the decreased vasodilator tone in the wall of large arteries from L-NAME-treated rats.",

The present study determined the time course and the dose-response relationship of radiation-induced hyperpermeability in cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (BPAE) cells. BPAE cells were grown to a confluent monolayer on microcarrier beads, and column chromatography methods were used to evaluate permeability to two low molecular weight compounds: sodium fluorescein (NaFlsc, mol. wt. = 342) and cyanocobalamin (B12, mol. wt. = 1355). This is a novel in vitro model to study mechanisms and modifiers of radiation-induced permeability of endothelial cells under flow conditions using nonradioactive tracers. Cell-covered beads were exposed to a single dose of 10 Gy Of 137Cs gamma rays and placed in the column, and permeability was measured every 30 min for 3 h. There was a time-dependent increase in permeability to both tracers, reaching significance by 2 h. Increased permeability was accompanied by perturbations in F-actin distribution in the BPAE cells as determined by rhodamine-phalloidin fluorescence microscopy. Neither catalase nor captopril ameliorated this hyperpermeability, but dibutyryl cAMP partially prevented it. At 3 h after 0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 Gy irradiation, permeability values of 11.8 +/- 2.1, 13.9 +/- 2.2, 20.9 +/- 3.6, 24.8 +/- 2.8 and 27.2 +/- 3.3 (10(-5) cm/s, +/- SEM), respectively, were observed using NaFlsc. The increase was significant (P < 0.05) at 2 Gy or higher. Permeability to B12 was significantly elevated after 5 or 10 Gy. These results suggest that permeability of endothelial cells to low molecular weight solutes increases within 3 h after therapeutic doses of radiation, and that cAMP ameliorates this response.",

The baseline findings were compared with those obtained in 24 diabetic subjects without hypertension (mean age 32.5 years) and in 24 non-diabetic hypertensive patients (mean age 47.6 years). Cardiovagal autonomic neuropathy was present in 10/13 (77%) of the hypertensive diabetic group, 14/24 (58%) the non-hypertensive diabetic group and 17/24 (71%) the non-diabetic hypertensive group. Heart rate variation was studied by power spectral analysis using total variability and three different frequency bands (low-frequency 0.025-0.075 Hz, mid-frequency 0.075-0.15 Hz and high-frequency 0.15-0.40 Hz). At baseline, the two hypertensive groups showed significantly smaller mid- and high-frequency heart rate variability compared with the diabetes only group. Age and the presence of cardiovagal autonomic neuropathy were important determinants of variability. Both metoprolol and enalapril reduced blood pressure comparably in hypertensive diabetics while metoprolol also reduced heart rate. Metoprolol decreased heart rate variability at the low-frequency and mid-frequency bands even after correction for the change in heart rate. Heart rate variability was not significantly altered by enalapril. In subjects with hypertension, diabetes and autonomic neuropathy, metoprolol almost abolished all heart rate variability. Therefore, an ACE inhibitor is a more neutral treatment alternative in such patients from the point of view of autonomic cardiac control.",

However, the significance of this early neurohumoral activation is unclear. The goals of this study were to determine the prognostic significance of the plasma concentrations of plasma norepinephrine (PNE) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the renin activity (PRA) in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "393": "PNE and PRA were measured before randomization in 514 patients with left ventricular ejection fractions < or = 35% who did not require treatment for congestive heart failure and were enrolled in the SOLVD Prevention Trial. Plasma ANP levels were measured in a subset of 241 patients owing to study design. Using the Cox proportional hazards model that included left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association functional class, age, sex, treatment assignment to placebo or enalapril, and cause of heart failure, we examined whether these neurohormones predicted all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, development of heart failure, or development of ischemic events (myocardial infarction or unstable angina). PNE was the strongest predictor of clinical events in this patient population. PNE levels above the median of 393 pg/mL were associated with a relative risk of 2.59 (P = .002) for all-cause mortality, 2.55 (P = .003) for cardiovascular mortality, 2.55 (P = .005) for hospitalization for heart failure, 1.88 (P = .002) for development of heart failure, 1.92 (P = .001) for ischemic events, and 2.59 (P = .005) for myocardial infarction. PNE remained the most powerful predictor for all-cause mortality and ischemic events when the analysis included only the patients with histories of ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. The increases in other neurohormonal levels were not useful in predicting the subsequent development of clinical events.", 
    "394": "Increased PNE levels in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction appear to predict all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities and development of clinical events related to the onset of heart failure or acute ischemic syndromes. Thus, measurement of PNE may be a possible early marker for assessment of disease progression in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and modulating the release or effect of PNE may lead to improved prognosis and/or a reduction in morbidity.", 
    "395": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) participates in the injury sustained by the remnant kidney. Our studies assessed the importance of aldosterone in that model and the response of aldosterone to drugs interfering with the RAAS. Initially, four groups of rats were studied: SHAM-operated rats, untreated remnant rats (REM), REM rats treated with losartan and enalapril (REM AIIA), and REM AIIA rats infused with exogenous aldosterone (REM AIIA + ALDO). The last group was maintained with aldosterone levels comparable to those in untreated REM rats by constant infusion of exogenous aldosterone. REM rats had larger adrenal glands and a > 10-fold elevation in plasma aldosterone compared to SHAM. REM AIIA rats demonstrated significant suppression of the hyperaldosteronism as well as marked attenuation of proteinuria, hypertension, and glomerulosclerosis compared to REM. REM AIIA + ALDO rats manifested greater proteinuria, hypertension, and glomerulosclerosis than REM AIIA rats. Indeed, by 4 wk of observation all of these features of the experimental disease were similar in magnitude in REM AIIA + ALDO and untreated REM. In separate REM rats spironolactone administration did not reduce glomerular sclerosis but did transiently reduce proteinuria, lowered arterial pressure, and lessened cardiac hypertrophy. In summary, aldosterone contributes to hypertension and renal injury in the remnant kidney model.", 
    "396": "Drosophila melanogaster angiotensin I-converting enzyme (AnCE) is a secreted single-domain homologue of mammalian angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) which comprises two domains (N and C domains). In order to characterize in detail the enzymic properties of AnCE and to study the influence of glycosylation on the secretion and enzymic activity of this enzyme, we overexpressed AnCE (expression level, 160 mg/l) and an unglycosylated mutant (expression level, 43 mg/l) in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant enzyme was apparently homogeneous on SDS/PAGE without purification and partial deglycosylation demonstrated that all three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation were occupied by oligosaccharide chains. Each N-glycosylation sequence (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) was disrupted by substituting a glutamine for the asparagine residue at amino acid positions 53, 196 and 311 by site-directed mutagenesis to produce a single mutant. Expression of the unglycosylated mutant in Pichia produced a secreted catalytically active enzyme (AnCE delta CHO). This mutant displayed unaltered kinetics for the hydrolyses of hippuryl-His-Leu, angiotensin 1 and N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) and was equally sensitive to ACE inhibitors compared with wild-type AnCE. However, AnCE delta CHO was less stable, displaying a half-life of 4.94 h at 37 degrees C, compared with AnCE which retained full activity under the same conditions. Two catalytic criteria demonstrate the functional resemblance of AnCE with the human ACE C domain: first, the kcat/Km of AcSDKP hydrolysis and secondly, the kcat/Km and optimal chloride concentration for hippuryl-His-Leu hydrolysis. A range of ACE inhibitors were far less potent towards AnCE compared with the human ACE domains, except for captopril which suggests an alternative structure in AnCE corresponding to the region of the S1 subsite in the human ACE active sites.",

    "401": "The first model of genetically engineered hypertension, the transgenic rat TGR (mREN2)27, provides a unique opportunity to study the behavioural effects of an altered brain renin-angiotensin system. The TGR (mREN2)27 rats, characterised by fulminant hypertension, show differences in both the peripheral and central angiotensin systems. The behaviour of male transgenic TGR (mREN2)27 and male Sprague-Dawley rats were determined by 4 behavioural tests. While on the elevated X-maze the TGR (mREN2)27 rat showed a greater 'anxiogenic' profile (fewer open arm entries) than the control Sprague-Dawley rats, this 'anxiogenic' profile increased further during a second exposure to the elevated X-maze 24 h later. In comparison the behaviour of the male Sprague-Dawley rats was not different between the two exposures to the elevated X-maze. Locomotor activity did not differ between either the TGR (mREN2)27 or Sprague-Dawley rats when placed in a 1 m2 open-field for 10 min. A short period of fluid-deprivation (3 h) reversed the 'anxiogenic' profile of the TGR (mREN2)27 on the elevated X-maze. Administration of captopril (20 mg . kg-1 body weight) in the drinking water of the TGR (mREN2)27 rats and Sprague-Dawley rats reversed the anxiogenic profile of the TGR (mREN2)27 rat on the elevated X-maze but did not alter the behaviour of the Sprague-Dawley rats.",

We have previously reported that compound 2 (N-[[1-[(2(S)-mercapto-3-methyl-1-oxobutyl) amino]-1-cyclopentyl]-carbonyl]-L-tyrosine) was a potent dual inhibitor in vitro (IC50 (ACE) = 7.0 nM, IC50 (NEP) = 1.5 nM) (Fink et al. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 5023-5030). This compound was found to have oral activity; however, its duration of effect was short. A series of thioacetate carboxylic acid ester analogs of compound 2 was prepared. Modifications were also made to the tyrosine phenol. These compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit plasma ACE activity when administered orally to conscious normotensive rats. Most of the compounds prepared were found to be orally active with longer durations of effect than compound 2. Compound 38 (N-[[1-[(2(S)-(acetylthio)-3-methyl-1-oxobutyl) amino]-1-cyclopentyl]carbonyl]-O-methyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester), administered at 11.7 mg/kg po, was found to be more efficacious than captopril at 10 mg/kg po. This compound was also found to inhibit plasma NEP activity following oral administration to conscious rats and was more efficacious than acetorphan. Compound 38 was found to lower blood pressure in the aorta-ligated rat and the spontaneously hypertensive rat when administered orally. The synthesis and biological activity of these dual inhibitors are discussed.", 
    "403": "Many biologically important ectoproteins that are anchored in the plasma membrane via a hydrophobic domain undergo a proteolytic cleavage process, which releases the ectodomain to the extracellular milieu in a regulated fashion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is one such protein that is secreted from human and mouse cells by its cleavage at one of two alternative sites in the ectodomain. Here, we report similar cleavage-secretion of ACE in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The cleavage site used in yeasts was identical to one of the two sites used in mouse cells. Moreover, as in mammalian cells, ACE secretion in yeast was inhibited by compound 3, a potent inhibitor of the metzincin family of metalloproteases. ACE proteins cleavage-secreted from yeast and from mammalian cells had identical enzymatic properties. These results demonstrate the existence of a secretase activity in yeast whose properties closely resemble those of the mammalian ACE secretase.",

Only group A was treated with perindopril 2 mg a day. We found that 2 years later glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and filtration fraction (FF) in the two groups decreased markedly, but GFR and FF decreased more markedly in group B than in group A. Meanwhile, in group A urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) and insulin sensitivity index (SI) decreased significantly and blood pressure was stable, but in group B UAER and blood pressure elevated significantly and SI was only slightly ameliorated (P > 0.05). The levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol were not markedly different between the two groups during the 2 years. These results indicate that ACEI may play a role in protecting the renal function in diabetic nephropathy, reduce the risk factors of atherosclerosis and improve SI. It is beneficial to retard the development of diabetic nephropathy and to protect in renal function with small dose of ACEI.",

This compound inhibited rat EP-24.15 competitively with an IC50 of 23 nM and Ki of 9.1 nM. These values were, respectively, 9.6 times and 6.3 times smaller than those for N-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-alanyl-alanyl-phenylalanyl-p-aminobenzoate (cFP-AAF-pAB), which was one of the most potent inhibitors thus far reported.

SA898 inhibited ACE significantly, but the potency was about 20-fold lower than that for EP-24.15 in terms of the Ki value. The inhibitory effect of SA898 on EP-24.11 was almost negligible (Ki = 28 microM). In addition, the inhibitory activities of several SA898-related compounds were examined. Based on these data, the structure-activity relationships for EP-24.15 inhibitors are discussed.", 
    "410": "Thiol-containing molecules possess antioxidant properties that are of interest in the pharmacological inactivation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly in the treatment of chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases. In the present study, the in vitro antioxidant activity of a new agent was examined and compared with other thiol containing molecules, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and captopril. Nacystelyn (CAS 89344-48-9, NAL) is a L-lysine salt of NAC having demonstrated several advantages as compared to NAC. The deoxyribose assay used for assessing the scavenging effect of drugs against hydoxyl radicals (.OH) first showed a prooxidant effect for thiols at relatively low concentrations that was attributed to a reduction of Fe(III) ions added in the system. This interference could be corrected by increasing ascorbate concentration. Second order rate constants for reaction with OH were calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of competition plots. Both NAL and NAC appeared as potent .OH scavengers (Ks > 10(10) mol-1 s-1) and reacted faster than captopril. The horseradish peroxidase assay for assessing the activity of thiols against H202 could not be used because thiol derivatives were substrates for the enzyme. By using the dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) assay, first order rate constants for reaction with H2O2 were obtained showing that both NAL and NAC reacted quite slowly with this species (K approximately equal to 0.03 min-1) although faster than captopril. Finally, the elastase-alpha 1-antiproteinase assay for assessing the activity of thiols against HClO again demonstrated the superiority of NAC and NAL over captopril, but this time, NAL was more efficient in maintaining the protease/antiprotease balance than NAC. This last observation may be of importance and deserves further investigation as HClO has been implicated in lung tissue damages during inflammatory respiratory diseases.",

Each dose of telmisartan (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) was given for one week via the drinking water to transgenic rats and cardiovascular parameters were monitored via telemetry. Losartan and captopril were given for comparison. Telmisartan dose-dependently decrease mean arterial blood pressure by -33 mmHg at 0.5 mg/kg/d, -57 mmHg at 1 mg/kg/d, and -72 mmHg at 2 mg/kg/d. Heart rate was lowered by -33 bpm at the lowest dose and -39 bpm at the highest dose of telmisartan. The reference compounds losartan and captopril given via the drinking water also lowered blood pressure in these transgenic rats. The decreases in mean arterial blood pressure amounted to -13 mmHg at 1 mg/kg/d, -22 mmHg at 2 mg/kg/d and -33 mmHg at 4 mg/kg/d losartan and -54 mmHg at 10 mg/kg/d captopril. In general, heart rates slightly decreased after oral administration of both compounds. These data show that telmisartan was an effective antihypertensive agent in these transgenic rats at oral doses of > or = 0.5 mg/kg/d. The compound was more potent than losartan in reducing mean arterial blood pressure in the TGR (mREN)27 transgenic rats.",

Sixty-four experiments were performed with drug in the absence and presence of classic inhibitors of the organic acid (i.e., probenecid and p-aminohippurate) and organic base (i.e., tetraethylammonium and quinine) transport systems of the proximal tubule. Initial perfusate concentrations of quinapril and quinaprilat were approximately 2.36 microM (or 1000 ng/ml), and transport inhibitors were coperfused at 100-10,000 times the drugs' initial microM concentrations. Quinapril and quinaprilat concentrations were determined in perfusate, urine, and perfusate ultrafiltrate using a reversed-phase HPLC procedure with radiochemical detection, coupled to liquid scintillation spectrometry. Perfusate protein binding was determined using an ultrafiltration method at 37 degrees C. Overall, the clearance ratios of quinapril (total renal clearance divided by fu x GFR) and quinaprilat (urinary clearance divided by fu. GFR) were significantly reduced, and in a dose-dependent manner, by the coperfusion of organic acids but not organic bases. The data demonstrate that the organic anionic secretory system is the primary mechanism by which quinapril and quinaprilat are transported into and across renal proximal cells.", 
    "417": "Angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors are now regarded as the cornerstone of congestive heart failure therapy owing to established reduction in mortality and the symptomatic amelioration following their use. Although the response to converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may be influenced by race, we have reported a trend to reduce intra hospital mortality, the correction of hyponatremia and shortened hospitalization in Nigerians treated with converting enzyme inhibitors. We have now conducted an extended retrospective study, to evaluate the trends in the use of enalapril or captopril and its impact on prognosis in Nigerian patients with heart failure alone, admitted between January 1992 to December 1994. The proportion of heart failure treated with (captopril or enalapril) increased from 37pc in 1992, to 50pc in 1993, to 65pc in 1994. The demographic variables and cause of heart disease were similar in patients treated with converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 55) and those treated conventionally (n = 36). The cumulative mortality among converting enzyme inhibitors treated patients, was (8/55, 14pc) compared to patients not treated (17/36, 48pc) x2 = 12.4; p < 0.0001. There was no sex predilection in mortality (M = 25pc, F = 28pc, mean 27pc). However, initial serum Na+,125mmol was significantly (x2 = 11.1; p < 0.001) more common in the dead patients, 25pc compared to the survivors discharged home 7.5pc. The median hospital stay was 17 days in captopril treated survivors (range two to 44 days) and 19 days (range four to 67 days) in conventionally treated patients. Thus converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may reduce intra hospital mortality in Black Africans hospitalized for congestive heart failure and shorten hospital stay, despite the epidemiologically low plasma renin in Blacks. Hyponatremia may be a poor prognostic index in heart failure in our patients, and its reversal by converting enzyme inhibitors may reflect neurohormonal inhibitor. Earlier and more wide spread use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in Nigerian and Black Africans with chronic heart failure is now clearly indicated.",

Besides, enalapril experimentally increases cardiac refractoriness. In this paper, recent advances in these three drugs are described.", 
    "420": "To find out which of the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the fetus are due to their actions in the mother and which are direct effects due to blockade of the fetal renin-angiotensin system, enalapril (150 mg twice daily i.v.), which does not readily cross the sheep placenta, was given for 3 days to nine chronically catheterized pregnant ewes, 5 days after fetal urine and lung liquid had been continuously drained and while drainage of these fetal fluids continued. Drainage of fetal fluids was carried out so that a net sodium deficit would be incurred, and the dependency of the ewe on the activity of her renin-angiotensin system (RAS) for maintenance of her arterial pressure and fluid and electrolyte balance would be increased. During drainage of fetal fluids ewes drank more and increased their net water balance (p < 0.025). With enalapril, ewes became hypotensive (p < 0.005), but heart rate did not change. Maternal plasma potassium (K) levels increased (p < 0.05) and the plasma sodium to potassium ratio (Na:K) decreased (p < 0.005). Enalapril did not reduce maternal water intake nor change her urine output. After 5 days of drainage, fetal plasma K levels (p < 0.05) were higher and plasma Na:K (p < 0.025) was lower. After maternal enalapril, lung liquid flow and electrolyte excretion were transiently reduced (p < 0.05). Fetal plasma K levels increased further (p < 0.025) and plasma Na:K ratio decreased (p < 0.025 - p < 0.01). Fetal arterial PO2 was reduced 2 h after enalapril (p < 0.005) and was low on the last 2 days of treatment. Although fetal fractional reabsorption of K fell (p < 0.01) by the last day of enalapril treatment, the increase in fetal K excretion was not significant, because by this time sufficient enalapril was present in the fetal circulation to reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR, p < 0.025 - p < 0.001). It is concluded that the toxicity of ACE inhibitors may be related to those effects in the ewe that lead to reduced fetal arterial oxygen levels and increased fetal plasma K levels. In the latter case it is postulated that inhibition of the maternal RAS may leave ewe and fetus deficient in aldosterone, leading to the rise in K levels. Thus the toxic effects of ACE inhibitors can be mediated through their effects on the mother, but their ability to cause fetal renal failure and oligohydramnios is due to their direct effects on the fetal RAS.", 
    "421": "Echocardiography is now considered to be the key investigation when heart failure is suspected, and should improve clinical management. An open-access echocardiography service was piloted to 24 general practitioners and the service was audited after 250 cases. The impact on clinical management was assessed by reviewing general practice notes 2 months after the echocardiogram. Significant impairment of left ventricular function was found in 49 patients (20%). Out of these subjects, 38 had been started on an ACE inhibitor. Twenty patients were considered to have a significant valve lesion by echocritiera, of whom 14 had been referred for a cardiological opinion. The provision of an open-access echocardiography service was popular with general practitioners and the information resulted in appropriate management decisions being made.", 
    "422": "Most clinical trials of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction have shown an improved outcome with reduction of morbidity and mortality. In comparable groups of patients, the results are concordant with a decrease in mortality which is all the more significant and early in severe infarction with serious haemodynamic consequences. The clinician has a new arm in his therapeutic arsenal either for use in the acute phase of all cases of myocardial infarction but for only a short period of 4 to 6 weeks after which the treatment is withdrawn when the anatomical sequellae are more moderate, or for use in selected cases for longer periods (patients with severe infarction with cardiac failure and/or severe left ventricular dysfunction). The second attitude has the advantage of treating a selected population which will derive greater benefits. In all cases, treatment should be started orally at low doses, and the dose must be increased rapidly do attain the target dosage under close clinical and biological surveillance. When the classical contraindications are respected, ACE inhibitors seem to be well tolerated even at the relatively high dosages recommended after myocardial infarction. Hypotension and, more rarely, renal failure, are the two most common complications leading to withdrawal of treatment, but neither of these side effects was associated with increased mortality in any of the clinical trials. The mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors exert these beneficial effects after myocardial infarction are not only their haemodynamic effects and their role in ventricular remodelling, but also probably by a vascular protective action which, if confirmed, would further increase the indications of this therapeutic class in cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "423": "The TRACE (TRAndolapril Cardiac Evaluation) study was designed to determine whether long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor is beneficial in patients with early post-myocardial infarction cardiac failure. A total 6,676 consecutive patients with 7,001 myocardial infarctions were included; 2,606 patients had echocardiographic signes of left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 35%), 3 to 7 days after myocardial infarction; 1,749 patients were randomised and given either oral trandolapril (876 patients) or placebo (873 patients). Follow-up ranged from 24 to 50 months. Three hundred and four patients (34.7%) in the trandolapril group died, compared with 369 (42.3%) in the placebo group (p = 0.001). The relative risk of death in the trandolapril group compared with the placebo group was 0.78. Trandolapril was also associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of cardiovascular death and of sudden death. Progression to severe cardiac failure was also less frequent in the treatment group. On the other hand, the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction was not significantly reduced. In conclusion, long-term treatment with trandolapril in patients with early post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular mortality, sudden death and progression to severe cardiac failure.", 
    "424": "Experimental studies and molecular biological techniques have demonstrated the importance of angiotensin II in ventricular and vascular remodelling and in atherogenesis. Large scale clinical trials analysing the effects of converting enzyme inhibitors on the mortality and morbidity in post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction, have shown beneficial effects of these agents on major events of coronary artery disease. Experimental studies have shown reduction of intimal thickening and of the multiplication and migration of smooth muscle cells and of vascular fibrosis. Converting enzyme inhibitors seem to restore endothelial function by acting as donors of NO and could play a role in the stabilisation of atheromatous plaque, the prevention of platelet aggregation and on the activation of intravascular fibrinolytic systems. Large scale clinical trials (SOLVD and the prevention and treatment arms of SAVE) have also shown a 23% reduction in the risk of reinfarction and a 15% reduction in the risk of unstable angina. The results of ongoing trials in patients with coronary artery disease without cardiac failure are awaited with great impatience.",

France is a zone at low risk even if deaths of undetermined causes are taken into account. This gradient is confirmed by the data from the Registries of the MONICA project. In France, the official mortality figures show a decrease of 28% in coronary mortality between 1985 and 1991 in men, throughout France. The differences in incidence of myocardial infarction between Lille and Toulouse in the MONICA project are not important but the differences in mortality are worrying. Between 1985 and 1991, the three registries show a 7% decrease in mortality (p < 0.001) and a 25% decrease in recurrences (p < 0.001) with an increase in primary infarcts of 8.3% (p < 0.05). There has been an increase in the prescription of betablockers, thrombolytics, ACE inhibitors and aspirin during the acute phase and at discharge form hospital. French cardiologists have followed the recommendations of the large scale clinical trials published during this period. The improved hospital mortality corresponds to the beneficial results reported in trials with aspirin, betablockers, ACE inhibitors and thrombolytics.",

The effects of antihypertensive treatment of SHRSP on the tension oscillation were also studied. High doses of noradrenaline induced tension oscillations in endothelium-intact preparations of all strains of young rats. The rate of the occurrence of the tension oscillation decreased age-dependently. The decrease was faster when the blood pressure of the rats was higher. Application of acetylcholine in the presence of noradrenaline induced a relaxation and tension oscillations, both of which were negatively dependent on age and blood pressure. Antihypertensive treatment of hypertensive rats with hydralazine or captopril prevented a decrease in incidence of the tension oscillation. These influences of age and blood pressure as well as antihypertensive treatments on the tension oscillation resembled those on the endothelium-dependent relaxation and are thought to be brought about by functional changes of the endothelium.", 
    "427": "This study characterizes the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system during the normal menstrual cycle in the baboon. Ten animals received a daily dose of an ACE inhibitor or placebo in a randomized blind cross-over design. Data were obtained during the mid-follicular and early luteal phases of normal non-pregnant menstrual cycles. All examinations and blood collections were performed with ketamine sedation: 7-kg by im injection. Blood pressure was recorded by sphygmomanometer. Serum ACE activity was measured by spectrophotometry. Aldosterone (ALDO), angiotensin I (AI), and angiotensin II (AII) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured by AI generation. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was found to be activated in the follicular phase and suppressed during the luteal phase of the normal non-pregnant menstrual cycle in the baboon.", 
    "428": "We tested the utility of qualitative microalbuminuria (MAU) screening in an office practice setting, in assessing the response of MAU to drug treatment. We enrolled general practitioners throughout Germany, who obtained histories, physical examinations, and routine laboratory values as clinically indicated on > 6000 non-treated hypertensive, nondiabetic patients. MAU was measured with an albumin-sensitive, immunoassay test strip. The patients were then assigned to monotherapy by their physicians with carvedilol, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and other single regimens in an open-label fashion. The goal was diastolic pressure < 90 mm Hg or at least a 10 mm Hg decrease in systolic (S) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The patients' mean age was 57 years and 51% were men. The mean known hypertension duration was 69 months. MAU was present in 37% of men and 34% of women. All regimens lowered BP. All regimens caused large numbers of MAU patients to revert by 3 months. MAU reversal occurred in patients less than 65 years as well as in those 65 years or older. Multiple regression analysis indicated that systolic and DBP reduction, duration of hypertension, and body size were most associated with MAU reversal. Thus, MAU determinations reverted to negative with antihypertensive treatment in many patients. BP reduction was the single most important variable in reversing MAU. All drug regimens were effective. We conclude that qualitative MAU detection is useful not only for screening, but also for follow-up nondiabetic patients with hypertension in an office practice setting.", 
    "429": "The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study evaluated the feasibility of carrying out a randomized, multicenter, 7-year clinical trial to determine the effects of two goal levels of blood pressure control and three antihypertensive drug regimens on decline in glomerular filtration rate in African Americans with clinically diagnosed hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Participants were randomized to either a usual mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) goal group (102-107 mm Hg) or a low-MAP goal group (< or = 92 mm Hg) and to a drug regimen (initial therapy with either atenolol, amlodipine, or enalapril). Quality of life was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36 (MOS SF-36) at baseline and the last follow-up visit for 84 of the 94 participants of the AASK Pilot Study. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and throughout the course of therapy by participant self-report. Mean SF-36 scores increased significantly on physical functioning (9.2), role limitations (physical) (19.0), social functioning (9.0), and vitality dimensions (5.6) from baseline to the last follow-up visit in the usual MAP goal group. Scores for the eight health dimensions assessed by the MOS SF-36 did not change significantly during the same time period either in the low-MAP goal group or in any of the drug regimens. The mean score for general health perception was significantly lower at the last follow-up visit in the enalapril drug regimen (49.9) compared to drug regimens with atenolol (65.4) or amlodipine (63.9). Physical functioning, role limitations (emotional), social functioning, mental health, vitality, and general health perception scores were negatively correlated with self-reported symptoms during treatment. We conclude that selected dimensions of quality of life improved during the AASK Pilot Study only in participants randomized to the usual MAP goal group. Significant differences between MAP goal groups and drug regimens at the end of follow-up were observed for only a few health dimensions.", 
    "430": "Hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, especially among African Americans. The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study evaluated the feasibility of conducting a long-term clinical trial to compare the effects of two levels of blood pressure control and three different antihypertensive drug regimens on the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in African Americans with clinically diagnosed hypertensive renal disease. African American men and women aged 18-70 years with a GFR of 25-70 ml/min/ 1.73m2 and hypertension were randomized in a 3 x 2 factorial design to initial treatment with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), or a beta blocker (atenolol) and to a mean arterial blood pressure (goal MAP) of either 102-107 mm Hg or < or = 92 mm Hg. Furosemide, doxazosin, clonidine, hydralazine, and minoxidil were added sequentially until goal MAP was achieved. To compare the pathologic diagnosis with the clinical diagnosis of renal disease, study participants without contraindication were also asked to undergo a renal biopsy. The goals of the AASK Pilot Study were to evaluate recruitment techniques, adherence to prescribed antihypertensive drug regimens, ability of the antihypertensive regimens to achieve blood pressure goals, rates of participation in scheduled clinic visits and procedures, and variability of GFR measurements. A further goal was to obtain renal biopsy data in at least 75% of the randomized study participants. Compared to the ESRD patient population whose renal disease is caused by hypertension, women were underrepresented in the AASK Pilot Study. AASK Pilot Study participants had higher unemployment rates and lower income levels than African Americans in the general U.S. population.", 
    "431": "1. Australian Aborigines have high rates of both cardiovascular mortality and renal failure and the usual male dominance in these conditions is respectively reduced and effaced. 2. In one Aboriginal community, we have demonstrated a strong association between albuminuria and cardiovascular risk factors and a relationship of both with insulin resistance, which is more pronounced in females than males. 3. We propose that albuminuria is a component of Syndrome X and that reduction in levels of albuminuria should prove to be a useful marker of effectiveness in treatment programmes targeting cardiovascular risk as well as renal disease.", 
    "432": "1. Most studies examining the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on atherosclerosis in experimental animals have used doses well in excess of those given clinically. 2. Using a rabbit model of cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis characterized by subendothelial lipid accumulations ('juvenile fatty streaks') in the aorta and atheromatous lesions in the pre-injured carotid artery, we examined the effect of perindopril (at doses approaching clinical relevance) on the development, progression and regression of atherosclerosis. 3. Administration of perindopril during the 6 weeks of cholesterol feeding reduced lipid accumulation in developing atheromatous plaques of the carotid artery and in fatty streaks of the aorta. In animals with pre-existing fat-filled lesions, perindopril inhibited progression of the disease in both vessels and aided lesion regression following return to a normal diet for up to 10 months. The protective effect of perindopril was not related to a decrease in blood pressure nor to an influence on serum cholesterol levels. 4. The bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe140 did not alter the effectiveness of perindopril in inhibiting either the development of atherosclerosis or vessel wall ACE activity, indicating that the anti-atherogenic effect of perindopril is not mediated through the B2 receptor. 5. The angiotensin II (AngII) receptor antagonist losartan had no effect on the development of atherosclerotic plaques in this rabbit model, indicating that inhibition of AngII production is not the mechanism by which perindopril exerts its antiatherogenic effects.", 
    "433": "1. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Both structural and functional improvements have been reported. 2. Hypertension, atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure or ageing are accompanied by endothelial dysfunctions. The vasoactive endothelium-derived relaxing factors, nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and prostacyclin, could be involved, depending on the pathology. 3. Some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors may be due to the augmented release of these endothelial factors resulting from the protection of locally produced bradykinin, particularly at the endothelial level.", 
    "434": "1. The conventional approach to drug therapy of hypertension and heart failure considers only effects of such drugs on peripheral resistance, cardiac output and heart rate. 2. A more complete approach needs to consider the pulsatile nature of cardiac ejection and so the influence of arterial stiffness and wave reflection properties and the effects of drugs on these. 3. Wave reflection normally aids cardiac function when full body height is achieved and arterial distensibility is high. However, with ageing or in hypertension the arteries stiffen and wave reflection returns early, augmenting systolic pressure, increasing pulse pressure and reducing the capacity for coronary perfusion. 4. In mature or older adults, delay of or reduction in wave reflection is an important therapeutic strategy for management of hypertension, angina pectoris and cardiac failure. 5. Beneficial effects of such therapy cannot always be gauged from conventional recordings of blood pressure, but can be inferred from analysis of pulse waveform.", 
    "435": "1. Haemodynamic evidence shows that in essential hypertension minimum vascular resistance and vascular pressor response are increased and that the vascular reserve is decreased. 2. The haemodynamic changes are most easily explained in terms of a generalized narrowing of the vasculature and an increase in the ratio between the thickness of the tunica media and the lumen diameter (media: lumen ratio), with no change in the functional properties of the smooth muscle itself. 3. Histological and in vitro studies of resistance vessels confirm these predictions. Moreover, the evidence indicates that these changes are associated mainly with remodelling (rearrangement of the same amount of material) of the vessels, rather than growth. 4. Although the alteration in small artery structure is usually appropriate to the actual blood pressure, the structure appears not only to be a secondary adaptation, but is also dependent on other factors, including neurohumoral factors. 5. The available evidence shows that normalization of the resistance vessel structure (by increasing lumen diameter and decreasing the media:lumen ratio) should be achieved not by inhibition of growth but by (reverse) remodelling. Recent evidence from clinical investigations shows that this can be achieved in essential hypertensive patients treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril. 6. The role of the resistance vasculature as a primary determinant of blood pressure remains unclear. It is suggested that the requirement for normalization of resistance vascular structure is due to a need to increase the vascular reserve.",

    "438": "Either treatment induced a similar reduction in blood pressure. Patients with PRA > 3 ng/ml per h treated with cilazapril showed a proportional increase in GFR, whereas in those treated with a non-CEI there was a decline in GFR after 8 and 12 months. Only diabetic patients treated with cilazapril showed a mu Alb reduction associated with a stable GFR.",

    "440": "Glucose homeostasis is maintained by a balance between the release and action of insulin, and the counterregulatory responses mediated principally by glucagon, catecholamines, growth hormone and cortisol. Hence, the effects of a drug on glucose metabolism may be mediated by any of these agents singly or in combination. Host factors, such as inherent glucoregulatory mechanisms, concurrent diseases, organ function and concomitant medications also increase the risk of drug-induced disturbances of glucose homeostasis in susceptible individuals. By far the most important agents causing hypoglycaemia are insulin and the sulphonylureas. Alcohol (ethanol), over-zealous glycaemic control, hypoglycaemic unawareness, detective counterregulation especially in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and renal and liver impairment are all important predisposing factors. Although antihyperglycaemic agents such as metformin and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors do not cause hypoglycaemia alone, they may enhance the hypoglycaemic effects of potent hypoglycaemic agents such as insulin and sulphonylureas. On the other hand, the potential hypoglycaemic effects of ACE inhibitors, alpha-blockers, lipid-lowering agents and recombinant human insulin-like growth factor demonstrated in experimental settings, are of potential therapeutic interest. Iatrogenic hypoglycaemia and intensive insulin treatment are associated with hypoglycaemic unawareness which may be obviated by meticulous avoidance of hypoglycaemia. Effective patient education remains an important preventive measure. Oral glucose is used to treat mild hypoglycaemic episodes while more severe episodes are treated by intravenous glucose or glucagon. Nasal glucagon and theophylline are other experimental measures to improve recovery from hypoglycaemia. In refractory hypoglycaemia due to hyperinsulinaemia such as during sulphonylurea overdosage or quinine treatment, the long-acting somatostatin, octreotide, may suppress insulin release and restore euglycaemia. Diuretics, beta-blockers, sympathomimetics, corticosteroids and sex hormones are commonly prescribed drugs which may have adverse effects on carbohydrate metabolism especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or those who are at risk of developing glucose intolerance. Pentamidine was frequently associated with dysglycaemia due to its pancreatic beta-cell cytotoxic effects but is now used less often to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients. Despite the large number of anecdotal reports of drug-induced disturbances of glucose metabolism, many of the so-called adverse drug reactions were either idiosyncratic or coincidental. Nevertheless, they emphasise the complex nature of glucose homeostasis and its potential interactions with drugs, host factors and disease states. An understanding of these relationships may allow more critical interpretation of these clinical observations, better prediction of drug induced adverse effects on carbohydrate metabolism and the implementation of more rational therapy. Hence, the hypoglycaemic effects of a drug may be turned to a therapeutic advantage in patients with glucose intolerance. Similarly, the hyperglycaemic effect of a drug may help to treat refractory hypoglycaemia.", 
    "441": "The role of converting enzyme inhibitor enhanced radionuclide investigations in post-transplant hypertension is not clearly defined. Presence of renal failure, chronic rejection and use of cyclosporin A complicates the results. Captopril-induced changes in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were studied in 10 patients with severe post-transplant hypertension and no evidence of rejection. Angiographic correlation was available in all. Six patients had a significant increase in ERPF after captopril, and all had a negative angiogram. One patient on CsA with a negative angiogram had no change in ERPF. Three patients had a fall in ERPF, and all 3 had transplant renal artery stenosis. Captopril-induced changes in ERPF can differentiate patients with native-kidney-induced hypertension from those with hypertension secondary to transplant renal artery stenosis in patients without evidence of rejection.", 
    "442": "Coronary arteries are regulated by neuronal mechanisms, hormones and paracrine mediators. The importance of endothelium-dependent mechanisms has recently been recognized. The endothelium responds to mechanical and chemical signals from the blood by releasing mediators that modulate vascular tone and structure, platelet function, coagulation and monocyte adhesion. Important relaxing factors are nitric oxide, prostacyclin and a putative hyperpolarizing factor. Nitric oxide also inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and, together with prostacyclin, platelet function. Bradykinin-induced nitric oxide production is reduced by angiotensin-converting enzyme. Endothelin-1, thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2 are contracting factors. Thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2 activate platelets, while endothelin has no direct platelet effects, but causes smooth muscle proliferation. In hypercholestermia, endothelium-dependent relaxation is impaired and contraction as well as adhesion of monocytes and platelets enhanced. Pharmacological correction of hyperlipidemia by statins also improves or normalizes endothelial dysfunction in patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have similar effects.", 
    "443": "Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.", 
    "444": "1. The methylation of captopril was studied in the microsomal fraction obtained from 87 specimens of human liver and 70 specimens of human renal cortex. 2. The rate captopril methylation ranged over one order of magnitude in the liver and kidney. In the human liver, the mean (+/- SD) rate of captopril methylation (pmol/min/mg) was significantly (p < 0.001) greater in women (199 +/- 97) than in men (126 +/- 88), whereas in the kidney no sex-difference was observed, and the mean (+/- SD) of all cases was 47 +/- 23 pmol/min/mg. 3. In the kidney, the statistical analysis revealed the presence of two subgroups in the rate of captopril methylation and their mean (+/- SD) estimates were 42.5 +/- 13.9 and 90.3 +/- 12.0 pmol/min/mg (p < 0.05). Of the population, 84% fell in the former and the remaining 16% in the latter subgroup. 4. Captopril is mainly eliminated by metabolism and its bioavailability is 65%. Methylation is one of the metabolic routes of captopril and its variability may contribute, to some extent, to modulate the intracellular concentration of this drug.", 
    "445": "The present study was undertaken to determine whether trandolaprilat, an active form of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, may improve ischemia/reperfusion-induced contractile dysfunction and metabolic derangement of isolated rat hearts. Ischemia (25 min) and subsequent 60-min reperfusion resulted in a small recovery of post-ischemic left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), a sustained increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, an increase in the release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites from the perfused heart, and changes in myocardial sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium contents. Treatment with 10-100 microM of trandolaprilat for the last 10 min of pre-ischemia recovered approximately 50-90% of pre-ischemic LVDP during reperfusion, whereas that with 30-100 microM of enalaprilat restored approximately 55-65% of the pre-ischemic LVDP. Treatment with either trandolaprilat or enalaprilat at these concentrations attenuated the release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites into the perfusate during reperfusion. Treatment with 30 microM trandolaprilat suppressed ischemia/reperfusion-induced changes in myocardial ion content. Treatment with bradykinin during the last 10 min of pre-ischemia also resulted in a post-ischemic contractile recovery with a degree similar to that of the trandolaprilat-treated hearts. E4177, an AT1-antagonist, showed no effect on ischemia/reperfusion-induced changes in cardiac parameters. The enhancement of post-ischemic contractile recovery by the ACE inhibitor was abolished by treatment with either Hoechst 140, a bradykinin (BK2) antagonist, or diclofenac, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. These results suggest that trandolaprilat is capable of attenuating ischemia/reperfusion injury of isolated perfused hearts and altered BK metabolism is, at least in part, involved in this effect.", 
    "446": "The antihypertensive effectiveness of moexipril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and sustained-release verapamil (verapamil SR) in combination with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide was investigated in patients with moderate to severe (Stages II and III) essential hypertension. Of 147 patients treated for 4 weeks with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day, 108 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 100 to 114 mmHg were randomly assigned to receive either moexipril 7.5 mg/day (n = 56) or verapamil SR 180 mg/day (n = 52) in addition to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day. After 4 weeks of treatment, doses of moexipril or verapamil SR were increased to 15 and 240 mg/ day respectively for patients with SDBP of > or = 90 mmHg. These patients were evaluated for an additional 8 weeks. Electrocardiograms, blood chemistries, blood counts, urinalysis, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone levels were monitored during the study. Moexipril or verapamil SR, in combination with low dose hydrochlorothiazide, resulted in decreased blood pressure in the sitting and standing positions. No correlation between blood pressure response and baseline plasma renin activity was demonstrated. The results of this study indicate that both moexipril and verapamil SR produced an additive hypertensive effect when added to low-dose hydrochlorothiazide. These combinations were well tolerated by the patients and did not result in serious clinical and metabolic side effects.", 
    "447": "The number of atrial angiotensin II binding sites is reduced in end-stage human heart failure. The goals of our study were the development of a quantitative polymerase chain reaction for angiotensin II receptor type 1 mRNA to determine the angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) mRNA content in the atria of patients with end-stage heart failure. We established a quantitative PCR based on coamplification of AT1 wild-type and an internal standard in the same PCR, followed by liquid-phase hybridization of PCR products in microtiter plates and quantitation by ELISA. Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in the same samples was used to relate the AT1 mRNA content to a stably expressed reference gene. Atrial samples from 11 patients with end-stage heart failure obtained at cardiac transplantation were compared with atrial samples from 11 patients with normal cardiac function undergoing routine cardiac surgery. A PCR/ELISA system with a variance of about 6% after reverse transcription and a linear measuring range was established. In the samples from 11 patients with end-stage heart failure a 58% decrease in AT1 mRNA content was found in comparison with 11 controls (heart failure: 185,680 +/- 196,912 AT1 mRNA copies/microgram RNA, controls: 440,555 +/- 268,456, P < 0.02). When AT1 mRNA content was related to glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, a 65% decrease was detected (AT1/glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase: heart failure: 4.84 +/- 5.18; controls: 13.74 +/- 7.77; P < 0.005). Standardization of PCR resulting in a low coefficient of variance, high reproducibility, and large sample capacity is possible using optimal internal standardization and the liquid-phase hybridization/ELISA system for detection. The optimized PCR procedure indicated downregulation of atrial AT1 in end-stage human heart failure, suggesting a reduced capacity of the atria to respond to angiotensin II stimulation in end-stage heart failure.", 
    "448": "We have developed an ELISA for BK-(1-5) (Arg1-Pro2-Pro3-Gly4-Phe5). In rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy, in which a plasma exudation peak was observed 5 h after carrageenin, BK levels in the exudates were negligible (< 60 pg/rat). BK-(1-7) (des-Phe8-Arg9-BK) was detectable (900-400 pg/rat) over the entire course of the inflammation. However, a larger amount of BK-(1-5) was detectable in association with the increase in plasma exudation, showing a peak (8800 +/- 1200 pg/rat) 3 h after carrageenin. Bromelain (10 mg/kg, i.v.) and soy bean trypsin inhibitor (0.3 mg/rat, intra-pleural) significantly reduced BK-(1-5) levels (by 60-93%, 3, 7 and 19 h after carrageenin) and plasma exudation rates (by 61-74%, 3 and 7 h after carrageenin). Dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced BK-(1-5) levels (by 78%) and decreased plasma exudation (by 70%) 3 h after carrageenin. In nasal allergy patients, antigen challenge of nasal mucosa elevated BK-(1-5) levels and active kallikrein levels in nasal washes. These results verify that BK-(1-5) determined by ELISA is a good indicator for release of kinins in vivo.", 
    "449": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve symptoms and prolong life in congestive heart failure, but the dose in the individual patient is uncertain. A randomized, 48-week, double-blind study was performed to investigate the safety and efficacy of 'high' in comparison to continued 'low' angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in severe heart failure. Eighty-three patients (56 +/- 1.1 years; 69 men, 14 women) in New York Heart Association functional class III/IV on digoxin, furosemide and 'low' angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril < or = 50 mg.day-1 or enalapril < or = 10 mg.day-1) were included. After a > or = 14 day run-in on 10 mg.day-1 enalapril, digitalis and furosemide, right heart catheterization at rest and exercise was performed. All patients presented with atrial pressure > 10 mmHg and/or pulmonary artery pressure > 35 mmHg, and/or cardiac index < 2.5 l.min-1.m-2 at rest. Patients then received enalapril 5 mg twice daily (n = 42), or 20 mg twice daily (n = 41) in random order. Thus, patients randomized to low doses of enalapril actually had no change in therapy from baseline to 48 weeks. Forty-three patients (52%) completed the study, 19 patients on the low dose and 24 patients on the high dose. Both dosages equally influenced survival with 15 (18%) deaths, eight on low dose and seven on high dose. After 48 weeks, functional capacity by New York Heart Association class improved more on the high dose than on the low dose (P = 0.04). In contrast, alterations in invasive haemodynamic variables at rest and exercise as well as maximal exercise capacity were comparable in both groups. Diastolic blood pressure decreased and the change between both groups was statistically significant (P = 0.01). Changes in plasma creatinine levels did not differ between high and low dose treatment and no patients had to be withdrawn because of deterioration in kidney function. With regard to neurohumoral activity, a tendency to a discrepant response to both treatments was observed with a blunted increase in noradrenaline on high versus low enalapril dose. Thus, high-dose enalapril treatment proved superior to low dose as regards symptomatology in severe heart failure after long-term treatment, despite similar effects on haemodynamics and on maximal exercise capacity.", 
    "450": "A large number of randomized clinical trials have shown that thrombolysis, long-term treatment with beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, for calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil) there was either no benefit, or positive effects have been reported in subgroups only. Recent studies have raised concern about the safety of this drug class, especially in patients with coronary heart disease. We studied the long-term survival, for a median follow-up time of 4.4 years, of 1197 non-diabetic patients in the population-based AMI registry in Augsburg, Germany, aged 25-74 years, who had survived a first Q wave acute myocardial infarction for at least 28 days. The impact of thrombolysis and prescribed medication at discharge (beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and calcium channel blockers) on long-term survival was analysed using the Cox-Proportional-Hazard model, controlling for age, sex, and concomitant cardiac drug use. Thrombolysis (risk ratio, RR, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.48-1.08), long-term beta-blockade (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.36-0.74) and antiplatelet drug use (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.94) were associated with considerable reductions in total mortality. The use of calcium channel blockers was not associated with a reduction in total mortality (RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.89-1.69). Separate analyses for nifedipine (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.68-1.48), and diltiazem (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.04-2.32) showed an increased risk of death associated with the latter. Using patients on beta-blockers only (RR 1.00) as a reference, the prescription of these calcium channel blockers was consistently associated with an increased total mortality (nifedipine, without beta-blockers RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.12-3.57, diltiazem, without beta-blockers RR 2.87; 95% CI 1.75-4.70). These results from an observational study demonstrate a benefit of thrombolysis, beta-adrenergic blockade and antiplatelet drug use on long-term survival in acute myocardial infarction patients. Calcium channel blocker use appears to be associated with an increased risk of death. These data support the need for controlled trials to address this issue specifically.", 
    "451": "Chronic, nonproductive cough and cough associated with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, are more frequently observed in females as compared to males. To examine the influence of sex, age, height, weight and pulmonary function on airway cough sensitivity, cough threshold to inhaled capsaicin, an index of the airway cough sensitivity, was measured in 160 nonsmoking, nonatopic healthy subjects. Forty young males (aged 24 +/- 2 yrs) 40 young females (aged 22 +/- 2 yrs) 40 middle-aged males (aged 48 +/- 5 yrs) and 40 middle-aged females (aged 50 +/- 7 yrs) were studied. The cough threshold was defined as the lowest concentration of inhaled capsaicin causing five or more coughs. The cough threshold was 3-5 fold lower in females than in males both in young (p<0.001) and middle-aged (p<0.005) subjects. Cough threshold was weakly but significantly correlated to height, weight, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) when all subjects were considered together but not when each group was considered separately. Multiple regression analysis revealed that sex difference was the significant predictive factor for the cough threshold in either age group. These results confirm that cough sensitivity is heightened in females and suggest that influence of height and pulmonary function on the cough threshold may have resulted from sex difference.", 
    "452": "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) may be important in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, and captopril is effective in treating this disorder. However, the mechanisms of this therapeutic effect as related to TGF-beta and its receptors are not known. Thus, the effects of captopril on cellular growth, TGF-beta 1, and TGF-beta receptors were studied in LLC-PK1 cells cultured in normal (11 mM) or high glucose (27.5 mM). This study found that glucose dose-dependently inhibited cellular mitogenesis while inducing hypertrophy in these cells at 72 h of culture, concomitantly with enhanced TGF-beta 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and TGF-beta receptor Types I and II protein expressions. Captopril dose-dependently (0.1 to 10 mM) increased cellular mitogenesis and inhibited hypertrophy in these cells. Moreover, captopril also decreased TGF-beta receptor Types I and II protein expressions dose-dependently. However, TGF-beta 1 mRNA was not affected by captopril. It was concluded that high glucose decreased cellular mitogenesis while increasing hypertrophy concomitantly with increased TGF-beta 1 mRNA and TGF-beta receptors in LLC-PK1 cells. Captopril can reverse high-glucose-induced growth effects by decreasing TGF-beta receptor protein expressions.", 
    "453": "The prevention of neointima formation by the tissue selective angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril and by the combination quinapril/G4120 (a platelet alpha Ub beta 3 and smooth muscle cell alpha v beta 3 antagonist) was investigated in a hamster carotid artery injury model. Quinapril at 10 mg/kg/day reduced neointima formation by about 45%, 1 and 2 weeks after injury to the artery, i.e. significantly better than the non-tissue selective ACE inhibitor captopril at 100 mg/kg/day. Quinapril did not decrease the early smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in the media, but in agreement with its inhibition of the carotid artery ACE activity by 62%, SMC proliferation was reduced by 70% in the newly forming intima. To improve the inhibition of early medial SMC proliferation, quinapril (10 mg/kg/day) was complemented with G4120 (100 micrograms/kg/h). This combined treatment reduced the proliferation of medial SMCs to about 50% throughout the first week following injury, whereas intima SMC proliferation was reduced by 70% throughout treatment. Accordingly, the drug combination reduced neointima formation more potently than each drug separately by 70%. The disruption of medial elastic laminae, observed in the control and G4120 treated group, was consistently reduced when G4120 was complemented with quinapril. Thus, the present study shows in a hamster model of carotid artery injury, that combining drugs that prevent SMC migration and proliferation via different modes of action can lead to the effective prevention of neointima formation.", 
    "454": "We describe a child with a neonatal presentation of Bartter's syndrome. Unlike infants previously described with a similar clinical presentation, the urinary excretion rate of prostaglandin E2 in this child was similar to normal children and Tamm-Horsfall protein was distributed normally in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The child failed to respond to indomethacin alone, but thrived after the addition of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril.", 
    "455": "1. Morphine-6-glucuronide is one of the major metabolites of morphine. The potent analgesic action of this compound together with its potential lower apparent toxicity in man, when compared with morphine, indicated its clinical importance. 2. Primary cultures of porcine brain capillary endothelial cells were used to study brain penetration of morphine-6-glucuronide. Biochemical characterization of the cell cultures revealed a marked enrichment in enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase (56 fold) and angiotensin converting enzyme (230 fold) as compared to whole brain tissue. By immunostaining the presence of vimentin, factor VIII, the tight junction associated protein ZO-1, and P-glycoprotein was shown. Functional characterization revealed that the carrier system responsible for transport of neutral amino acids was intact. 3. Uptake and transport of morphine-6-glucuronide was marginal and in the range of the extracellular marker sucrose. However, uptake of morphine-6-glucuronide was enhanced significantly (P < 0.0001) in presence of the inhibitors of P-glycoprotein, verapamil or vincristine. The finding that morphine-6-glucuronide may serve as a substrate for P-glycoprotein was confirmed in multidrug-resistant P388 tumour cells. 4. We conclude that penetration of the blood-brain barrier by morphine-6-glucuronide may depend on the expression of the product of the multidrug-resistance (MDR) gene in brain capillary endothelial cells.", 
    "456": "Peptidase-degradable leucine enkephalin (LE) was coupled with cellobiose or gentiobiose. In the absorption experiments, cellobiose-coupled LE (CcpLE) was more stable than LE itself on the mucosal side, and CcpLE appeared on the serosal side. Destyrosyl LE coupled with cellobiose was not formed, indicating that sugar coupling provided LE with aminopeptidase resistance. In the presence of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme and enkephalinase, the stability of CcpLE on the mucosal side was increased, and as a result more was absorbed. Furthermore, the absorption clearance was much higher than the value expected from the mucosal concentration of CcpLE. Similar results were observed in the absorption of gentiobiose-coupled LE. In the LE absorption experiment, however, LE was not detected on the serosal side even in the presence of these peptidase inhibitors. Improvement of intestinal absorption by sugar coupling and peptidase inhibitors was evaluated kinetically, indicating the exclusive contribution of metabolic degradation of LE through intestinal tissues to the absorption process.", 
    "457": "In the past 20 years, clinicians have clearly demonstrated that antihypertensive therapy is very effective in reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. However, little is known about the effects of blood pressure reduction on end stage renal disease (ESRD). Data from major clinical studies has clearly shown that patients with hypertension have an increased risk of developing ESRD. Black men and women with hypertension are at the greatest risk; however, the incidence of ESRD is increasing in all racial groups. Because patients with hypertensive ESRD often require dialysis, the cost of treating this increasing common disorder has the potential to deplete the Medicare system. The primary effect of blood pressure reduction in patients with ESRD has not been adequately addressed in any trial that has been completed to date. Results from some studies suggest that blood pressure reduction may improve renal function and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may have renoprotective effects. Currently in progress are two large scale clinical trials that may provide more information on the effects on antihypertensive therapy on preventing ESRD in hypertensive patients. These are the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), and a substudy of the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study. Data from the HOT study is expected to be available 5 years prior to that of the ASK Study, which is expected to be completed by the Year 2002.", 
    "458": "We have recently shown an enhanced expression of Gi alpha-2 and Gi alpha-3 at protein and mRNA levels and their relationship with adenylyl cyclase regulation in hearts and aorta from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The present studies were undertaken to examine if the antihypertensive action of captopril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is associated with the interaction and modulation of G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase activity. SHR and age-matched WKY were divided into two groups. One group of rats received captopril (10 mg/kg body weight) intravenously, whereas the other group received only vehicle (0.9% saline). The levels of Gi alpha-2 and Gi alpha-3 proteins were determined by immunoblotting technique using specific antisera against these proteins. The levels of Gi alpha-2 and Gi alpha-3 proteins were significantly enhanced in hearts from SHR as compared to WKY and captopril treatment restored the enhanced levels of Gi alpha-2 and Gi alpha-3 observed in SHR by about 70% to 80% towards WKY control rats. However, captopril slightly decreased the levels of Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3 protein in normotensive WKY. In addition, the diminished stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by isoproterenol, glucagon and N-ethyl carboxamide adenosine and enhanced inhibition by inhibitory hormones such as C-type natriuretic peptide and angiotensin II observed in SHR was restored significantly by captopril treatment. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which captopril lowers the blood pressure may be due to its ability to modulate the levels of G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase activity.", 
    "459": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is an adaptive response to long standing hypertension. However, the influence of left ventricular hypertrophy with hypertension on extent of infarct expansion has not been studied. We compared the effects of left ventricular hypertrophy with hypertension on infarct expansion in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, n = 76), Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY; n = 46) and spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with delapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (SHRD; n = 39). The survival rates at 7 days after myocardial infarction were 41%, 24%, and 46% for WKY, SHR, and SHRD. The survival rate of SHR was significantly lower than those of both SHRD and WKY (P < .05). In the surviving rats (18 SHR, 19 WKY, 18 SHRD), both left ventricular cavity area (LCVA) and the infarct segment length per the noninfarct segment length (FW/IVS), measured as indices of left ventricular dilation, were significantly less in SHR and SHRD than in WKY, and the thickness of the left ventricular free wall (Wth), used as an index of left ventricular thinning, was significantly higher in both SHR and SHRD than in WKY (P < .01). However, there was no significant difference in FW/IVS, LCVA, and Wth between SHR and SHRD. Hemodynamic findings 1 week after coronary occlusion demonstrated that all rats were in heart failure, and there were no significant differences in hemodynamics among the three groups. In conclusion, our findings showed that hypertrophy with hypertension reduced infarct expansion, but that reduction of blood pressure by ACE inhibitor did not reduce infarct expansion more than hypertrophy did. However, this finding suggest that an ACE inhibitor may improve the rate of survival of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy with hypertension.", 
    "460": "Burn injury and sepsis produce acute gastrointestinal derangements that may predispose patients to bacterial translocation. We studied the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), on gastrointestinal anatomic alterations, bacterial translocation, and related mortality during gut-derived sepsis in burned mice that had received a prior bacterial challenge. BALB/c mice (n = 111) were treated with enalapril 10 or 1 mg/kg body weight or sterile saline as control twice daily for 3 days. They were then gavaged with 10(a)111 in radiolabeled or unlabeled Escherichia coli and given a 20% total body surface area (TBSA) burn injury. Animals gavaged with unlabeled bacteria were observed for survival (n = 60). Survival was significantly higher in the group receiving enalapril 10 mg/Kg compared with control (75% vs. 10%). Mice treated with enalapril maintained small intestine weight, measured 4 h postburn, and ileal mucosal height was preserved, whereas burned untreated animals lost intestinal weight and mucosal height. Bacterial translocation was decreased in mice treated with enalapril, but killing was unaffected. This study suggests that treatment with enalapril positively affects the outcome in gut-derived sepsis by ameliorating gastrointestinal structural and functional damage and decreasing bacterial translocation.", 
    "461": "Previous work has shown that, in rat ventricular muscle, bradykinin (BK) causes a dose-dependent increase in action potential duration (APD), an action that may be responsible for APD prolongation by captopril (kininase II). To determine which kinin receptor might be involved in APD prolongation, we studied the effects of B1- and B2-receptor agonists, as well as those of antagonists and mergepta (a kininase I inhibitor) added during BK superfusion. Action potentials were recorded by using the standard glass microelectrode technique in rat ventricular muscle preparations. Action-potential characteristics were compared between preparations superfused with peptide/drug-free Tyrode's solution (control group) and preparations superfused with peptide/drug-containing solution. APD was significantly longer in preparations superfused with BK (10(-8) M) than in the control group. The APD prolongation induced by BK, a known B2-receptor agonist, was significantly reduced by Hoe 140 (a B2 antagonist) and also by Lys[Leu8]des-Arg9-BK (a B1 antagonist), an action presumably related to inhibition of B1 receptor stimulation by the BK metabolite des-Arg9-BK. When mergepta was added in the presence of BK, APD prolongation by BK was significantly reduced, an effect that could have been related to reduced B1-receptor stimulation after inhibition of the endogenous generation of des-Arg9-BK by kininase I. Sar4-[d-Phe8]des-Arg9-BK, a B1-receptor agonist that is not degraded by kininase II, also prolonged APD. We conclude that both B1 and B2 receptors may be involved in APD prolongation induced in rat ventricular muscle preparations.", 
    "462": "Pharmacologic modulation by an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (IACE: cilazapril) of vascular proliferative response to a full-thickness arterial injury (autograft) was studied in rats. An arterial autograft 5 mm long was made in the right common iliac artery of 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 250-300 g) by microsurgical techniques. The animals were divided into two study groups: group I (controls), 20 animals that underwent arterial autograft but received no other treatment; and group II (cilazapril-treated), 20 rats that underwent arterial autograft and received cilazapril (Roche), 10 mg/day orally (p.o.) in an excipient of 2% arabic gum, for 4 days before operation. Animals were killed on postoperative days 7, 14, 21, 30, and 50, and grafts were studied by light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and morphometry. In the control group, the hyperplasic response had begun by postoperative day 14 and was established by postoperative day 50. In the medial layer, the muscle cells changed in phenotype from contractile to secretory cells. The adventitia had a highly proliferative appearance. In the cilazapril-treated group, fibrin deposits and platelets formed a layer on the internal elastic lamina. This layer appeared to evolve toward an intimal hyperplasia that became quantifiable by postoperative day 21. The medial layer was clearly thinned and showed intense accumulation of lipid microvacuoles, elastic degeneration, and vacuolized cells. Our results suggest that the use of an inhibitor of ACE modified the origin of the intimal hyperplasia in the arterial autograft model. Enhancement of the thrombogenicity of the luminal surface favors myointimal development by thrombus reorganization.", 
    "463": "Previous studies indicate that angiotensin II (ANG II) plays a minor role in the hemodynamic responses during dynamic exercise. However, nonspecific effects associated with methods used to block its production [e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors] or receptors (e.g., saralasin) may have contributed to these findings. Losartan is a nonpeptide ANG II receptor antagonist that is devoid of such nonspecific effects. We hypothesized that the contribution of ANG II to the cardiovascular response to dynamic exercise is characterized more precisely with losartan than with saralasin. On separate days, 6 miniswine performed treadmill running at 80% of their maximal heart rate (HR) reserve (HRR) in the presence of vehicle (0.9% saline), saralasin (10 or 20 micrograms/kg/min intraleft arterially, i.a.), or losartan (15 or 20 mg/kg i.a.). Cardiac output (CO), HR, and myocardial contractility were similar among all exercise conditions. As compared with the vehicle, losartan decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during exercise, whereas no differences occurred between the vehicle and saralasin conditions. Both receptor antagonists increased blood flow and/or decreased vascular resistance during exercise in the myocardium, stomach, small intestine, and colon. As compared with that during treadmill running with vehicle infusion, renal blood flow (RBF) was increased by losartan and decreased by saralasin. We conclude that the contribution of ANG II to the cardiovascular response to dynamic exercise is demonstrated more clearly with losartan than with saralasin.",

A concentrated protein sample from the 37 degrees C overnight culture supernatant of CVD110, a delta ctxA, delta zot, delta Ace and hlyA::(ctxB mer) mutant of El Tor biotype Ogawa serotype strain E7946 caused morphological changes in cultured MDCK-I epithelial cells and altered their arrangement of filamentous actin (F-actin) and Zonula occludens-associated protein ZO-1. The drastic morphological changes can be inhibited by Zincov, a specific bacterial metalloprotease inhibitor. The cytotoxic fractions of the sample after FPLC gelfiltration fractionation showed two visible protein bands with molecular weights of approximately 34- and 32 kDa. Microsequencing of these two proteins revealed that they were the cholera HA/protease.", 
    "469": "We examined effects of dietary salt and cilazapril on ATP-driven Ca pump and Na/Ca exchange system in arterial smooth muscle of Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. Twenty-four DS rats were assigned to 4 groups. H- and H+ rats were fed a high-salt diet. L- and L+ rats were fed a low-salt diet. H+ and L+ were administered cilazapril. Aortic rings were superfused with physiological saline, and isometric tension was measured. Relaxation rates of low-Na(+)-induced contractions were promoted by the removal of external Ca. Cilazapril significantly decreased blood pressure in both the high- and low-salt diet groups. Salt loading reduced relaxation rates in 1.2 mmol/l Na+, and enhanced the increase in relaxation rates from 1.2 mmol/l to normal Na+. A negative correlation was observed between Ca extrusion by the Ca pump and blood pressure, and a positive correlation was observed between Ca extrusion by Na/Ca exchange and blood pressure. The results suggest that the decrease of Ca2+ extrusion by the ATP-driven Ca pump resulting from a high-salt diet might lead to an elevation in the concentration of cellular Ca2+.",

The Captopril test and renal scintigraphy (both with and without Captopril) also showed normal patterns. Echo-Doppler velocimetry of the renal artery revealed that left renal arterial peak flow velocity was fast (3.4 m/s). The patient was therefore diagnosed with left renal arterial stenosis. Angiography demonstrated the duplex of the left renal artery and stenosis of the left lower renal artery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was successfully performed.",

Time-activity curves of the [99mTc]-DTPA studies using segmental regions of interest corroborated visual findings. The presence of renal artery branch stenosis was confirmed on renal angiography.", 
    "472": "Over the past 20 years, the concept of chronic heart failure has changed. The activation of neurohumoral system is important in worsening the chronic heart failure. Therefore, it is reasonable to block the effect of the renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system on the heart for treatment of heart failure. Many studies have demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the level of angiotensin II and plasma norepinephrine, and improve long-term hemodynamics and survival in patients with chronic heart failure. However, despite the wide use of ACE inhibitors, the prognosis of chronic heart failure remains poor. Although beta-blockers can block the effect of sympathetic nervous system activity, these agents had not been used for the treatment of chronic heart failure because of its negative inotropic action. In 1975, Waagstein and associates described functional improvement in seven patients receiving beta-blockers. Subsequently, many workers have examined the therapeutic efficacy of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Eleven studies reported the long-term effect of beta 1-selective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathetic activity including metoprolol and bisoprolol, and 14 studies were performed using beta-blockers with vasodilator properties including bucindolol and carvedilol. These studies predominantly included patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, although some also included patients with ischemic heart disease. Most but not all of these studies showed beneficial effects on symptoms, hemodynamics and morbidity in both dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease. Vasodilating beta-blockers may provide an additional useful effect compared to beta-blockers without vasodilator properties. However, direct comparisons between beta-blockers with and without vasodilator properties on clinical efficacy have not yet been made. The effect of beta-blockers on survival was investigated in five controlled trials. Although these studies suggested a beneficial effect of beta-blockers on survival in chronic heart failure, the effect has not yet been conclusively determined especially in patients with chronic heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. Some investigators are proposing the use of beta-blockers in chronic heart failure to ameliorate the harmful effect of excess sympathetic stimulation, but the exact mechanisms of beta-blockers are uncertain. Although a large number of studies have demonstrated the usefulness of beta-blocker treatment for chronic heart failure, many unsolved problems such as the exact mechanisms of beneficial effect, usefulness for ischemic heart disease, and the optimal agent and dose for treatment remain. Further studies are needed to establish this treatment.",

    "484": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) dilates resistance arterioles in the in situ systemic circulation and whether inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), two membrane-bound metalloenzymes that are widely distributed in the microcirculation and cleave and inactive VIP, potentiate this response. Using intravital microscopy, we found that VIP (0.05 and 0.1 nmol) induced significant vasodilation in the hamster cheek pouch (13 +/- 1 and 20 +/- 2% increase from baseline, respectively; mean +/- SE; P < 0.05). These responses were significantly potentiated by topical application of phosphoramidon and thiorphan, two relatively selective NEP inhibitors, but not by captopril, a relatively selective ACE inhibitor. Furthermore, suffusion of a mixture of proteinase inhibitors consisting of leupeptin, Bestatin, and DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid to inhibit serine proteinases, including mast cell tryptase, aminopeptidases, and carboxypeptidase N, respectively, had no significant effects on VIP-induced responses. These data indicate that VIP elicits vasodilation in the in situ systemic microcirculation and that NEP modulates this response.", 
    "485": "To assess the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the renal alterations of the lyon hypertensive (LH) rat, the renal function of LH rats and of their normotensive (LN) controls was studied at different pressure levels after an early and chronic blockade of the RAS by perindopril (3 mg.kg-1.day-1 orally from 3 to 15 wk of age) and after an acute infusion of angiotensin II (ANG II, 10 or 50 ng.kg-1.min-1). Over the range of renal perfusion pressures studied (115-165 mmHg), control LH differed from LN rats by an increased preglomerular vasoconstriction and a blunted pressure-natriuresis curve. Perindopril fully prevented the development of hypertension in LH rats, suppressed their preglomerular vasoconstriction, and markedly improved their pressure-natriuresis. In perindopril-treated LH, ANG II produced a greater reduction in renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary sodium excretion that was not significantly modified by blockade of thromboxane A2-prostaglandin H2 receptors. These results indicate that the blood pressure level and the renal function of LH rats are closely dependent on an active RAS.", 
    "486": "These experiments tested the hypothesis that hypertension caused by chronic inhibition of nitiric oxide synthase (NOS) is associated with augmented pressor responsiveness to angiotensin II (ANG II). Antagonism of ANG II AT1 receptors with losartan caused a greater fall in blood pressure (BP) in rats treated for 2 wk with the NOS inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) than in normotensive rats. The delayed time course of the decline in BP implicated the slow pressor effect (SPE) of ANG II in L-NAME hypertension. Further experiments showed that direct elicitation of the SPE by continuous low-dose (4 ng/min) intravenous infusion of ANG II in enalapril-treated rats resulted in a larger chronic increase in BP if NOS was inhibited. However, L-NAME alone also caused a significant increase in BP in enalapril-treated rats. The combined effect on BP of ANG II and L-NAME was merely additive. These results confirm that ANG II is involved in L-NAME hypertension. However, chronic pressor responsiveness to the peptide is not augmented by L-NAME.", 
    "487": "The pulmonary isozyme of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEP) is present in the body both as a cell-associated protein in endothelial, epithelial, and monocytic cells and as a soluble protein in various body fluids including serum. The mechanism by which soluble ACEP is produced in vivo is unknown. Using in vitro transfected cell culture systems, we previously demonstrated that the rabbit testicular isozyme of ACE (ACET), which shares extensive homology with ACEP, is first synthesized as a plasma membrane-anchored ectoprotein and then secreted to the culture medium by cleavage removal of its COOH-terminal membrane-anchored tail. Here, using in vitro cultures of arterial endothelial cells and acutely isolated renal epithelial cells, we demonstrate that ACEP is also cleavage secreted from their natural producer cells. Biochemical and immunological characterization of the in vitro secreted ACEP protein revealed that it is missing the COOH-terminal membrane-anchored region of the cell-associated ACEP. Similar analysis of ACEP proteins present in rabbit serum, lung, and kidney established that ACEP secretion in vivo is also caused by the cleavage removal of the COOH-terminal region of the cell-associated protein. To characterize the proteolytic enzyme responsible for ACEP secretion, we employed rabbit renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and demonstrated significant inhibition of secretion by compound 3, a hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor of specific metalloproteases. In contrast, the inhibitors of chymotrypsin, trypsin, serine, aspartate, and cysteine proteases were ineffective. These results indicate that soluble ACEP production by vascular endothelial and renal epithelial cells, both in vitro and in vivo, is achieved by cleavage removal of its membrane-anchoring COOH-terminal tail by a metalloprotease.", 
    "488": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) induces peripheral vasoconstriction and impairs endothelium-dependent relaxation of large arteries. We investigated in a rat model of CHF (coronary artery ligation) 1) whether endothelial dysfunction also exists in resistance arteries, 2) whether this is associated with vascular morphological changes, and 3) the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on these parameters. After 1 mo or 1 yr, CHF reduced the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine of isolated, perfused femoral and mesenteric artery segments. This impairment was more marked in femoral than in mesenteric arteries. However, CHF did not induce any arterial remodeling. Chronic treatment with the ACE inhibitor perindopril improved the response to acetylcholine and reduced media cross-sectional area and collagen density. Thus at the level of small peripheral arteries, CHF induces an endothelial dysfunction but does not affect vascular structure. ACE inhibition prevents the CHF-induced endothelial dysfunction and induces vascular remodeling. These changes could contribute to the observed beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on hemodynamics and survival in CHF.", 
    "489": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (I) have beneficial effects that are presumably mediated by decreased angiotensin II (ANG II) production. However, in vitro assays in human heart extracts have demonstrated that > 75% of ANG II-forming enzyme activity was not inhibited by captopril (Cap) and therefore did not appear to be related to ACE but was inhibited by chymostatin, suggesting that it was predominantly chymase-like activity. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated a similar relative contribution of ACE and chymase-like activity toward ANG II formation in vitro in dog heart tissue extracts. Accordingly, we compared Cap-inhibitable ANG II formation in vitro in heart tissue of five adult mongrel dogs to the in vivo Cap-inhibitable, ANG II-forming activity across the myocardial bed in four openchest, adult mongrel dogs. In vitro studies demonstrated that only 6 +/- 2% of ANG II formation was inhibited by Cap from heart tissue extracts of the left ventricular midwall. In in vivo studies, ANG I (0.5 nmol/min) followed by ANG I plus the ACE inhibitor Cap (0.1 mumol/min) was infused into the left anterior descending artery, and ANG II was assayed in the proximal aorta and coronary sinus. The arterial-venous (A-V) difference of ANG II across the myocardial circulation increased significantly during ANG I infusion (-13.4 +/- 23.5 to 142.8 +/- 71.4 pg/ml; P < 0.03). Subsequent coinfusion of Cap with ANG I significantly decreased the myocardial A-V difference of ANG II by 60 +/- 18% (P < 0.05). Thus, in contrast to the in vitro situation, ANG II formation in vivo is inhibited significantly by Cap in the normal dog heart. This comparison of in vivo and in vitro conversion of ANG I to ANG II by ACE and chymase-like activity suggests that in vitro assays may underestimate the functional contribution of ACE to intracardiac ANG II formation.", 
    "490": "Eighty-six hypertensive patients with clinical suspicion of renovascular hypertension (RVH) were evaluated by captopril renal scintigraphy (CRS) and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA) to determine the usefulness of CRS in the diagnosis of RVH and to predict the outcome of revascularization procedures. Technetium 99m-diethlenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) renal scintigraphy was performed on 2 consecutive days before and after captopril administration. Captopril renal scintigraphy was considered positive if there were changes in the time activity curve according to the criteria specified by the American Society of Hypertension working group. Captopril renal scintigraphy data were compared with presence or absence of anatomic renal artery stenosis (RAS). Of 86 hypertensive patients investigated, 45 had RAS. Aortoarteritis was the cause of RAS in 40 (89%) patients. Revascularization was done in 25 patients, and response to revascularization was compared with that of captopril renography. Compared with IADSA, CRS showed a sensitivity of 82.8% and a specificity of 98.2%. Fourteen patients had bilateral RAS on IADSA. In these patients, CRS was suggestive of bilateral disease in seven patients, unilateral in four, and negative in three. Comparison of CRS with the results of revascularization showed a sensitivity and specificity in detecting curable RAS (RVH) of 95% and 100%, respectively (positive predictive value, 100%; negative predictive value, 85%). In conclusion, we found CRS to be useful in the diagnosis of RVH due to aortoarteritis.", 
    "491": "The pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is unknown, but it is characterized by aggressive glomerulosclerosis, tubulopathy, and interstitial inflammation. Currently, no therapy has been proven effective for HIVAN. Angiotensin II has been implicated in the pathogenesis of progressive renal disease in the absence of HIV infection, and treatment with captopril enhances renal survival in patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are elevated in patients with HIV infection. We therefore compared the course of 18 patients with biopsy-proven HIVAN (nine treated three times per day with captopril and nine not treated [controls]). The controls were matched to the study patients by age, race, gender, and level of serum creatinine concentration. Renal survival was measured from time of biopsy and treatment with captopril until onset of therapy for end-stage renal disease. Differences between the groups' survival were assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Seven African-American men and two women were in the captopril-treated group, and eight African-American men and one woman were in the control group. No control patient died before the initiation of dialysis. There was no difference between initial mean serum creatinine concentration (3.4 +/- 0.7 mg/dL v 3.7 +/- 0.5 mg/dL), CD4 count (66 +/- 27/microL v 92 +/- 15/microL), or age (41.4 +/- 4.1 years v 36.4 +/- 2.6 years) in the study patients and controls, respectively, but the mean urinary protein to creatinine ratio was higher in the study patients. Renal survival was enhanced in the patients compared with the controls (mean renal survival, 156 +/- 71 days v 37 +/- 5 days, respectively; curves different; P < 0.002, Mantel-Cox log-rank test). Captopril and antiretroviral therapy were associated with enhanced renal survival in a Cox regression analysis, while age, level of serum creatinine, urinary protein to creatinine ratio, and CD4 count were not. These data suggest that treatment with captopril and antiretroviral therapy might be useful in delaying the rapidly progressive renal failure characterizing HIVAN. Captopril might exert its effects by reducing angiotensin II levels, or, alternatively, through decreasing renal tissue expression of growth factors and cytokines or by affecting HIV protease activity and therefore extent of productive renal infection. Such findings must be confirmed by randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.", 
    "492": "The vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are oppositely involved in the development of heart failure, as modeled by myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. MI is a model also characterized by sodium retention despite the elevated plasma ANP levels, showing a desensitization of responses to ANP. S21402 (RB105) {N-[2S,3R-(2-mercaptom-ethyl-1-oxo-3-phenylbutyl) L-alanine]} is a dual inhibitor that inhibits both neutral endopeptidase (Ki = 1.7 +/- 0.3 nM) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ki = 4.2 +/- 0.5 nM). Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase protects endogenous ANP, and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme blocks angiotensin II production, whereas inhibition of both peptidases is required to protect endogenous bradykinin (BK). Induction of MI in rats, by ligation of the left coronary artery, increased the base-line plasma ANP, cyclic GMP (cGMP) and renin concentrations, which were related to the degree of MI (moderate and severe MI rats). Urinary excretion of ANP, cGMP and BK was also increased in MI rats and was linked to the infarction size. S21402 (RB105) (25 mg/kg bolus plus 25 mg/kg/hr i.v.) decreased the mean blood pressure and increased natriuresis in MI rats whatever the degree of MI. S21402 (RB105) induced an increase in plasma renin in MI rats despite the elevated base-line levels. S21402 (RB105) did not alter the plasma in ANP in MI rats. However, plasma cGMP was increased by the dual inhibitor, as a function of the infarction severity. Urinary excretion of ANP, cGMP and BK was also increased by S21402 (RB105), proportionally to the infarction size. Whatever the degree of MI, S21402 (RB105) was able to induce natriuresis, characterized by a desensitization of ANP-induced renal responses. Inhibition of both angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase by potentiating endogenous ANP and BK and blocking angiotensin II production could be an interesting therapeutic approach in heart failure.", 
    "493": "1. The best way to prevent early growth failure in children with renal disease is by the use of specified nutrition and appropriate buffer, activated vitamin D, and calcium-containing phosphate binders as needed. With prenatal diagnosis of anatomically abnormal kidneys available, this type of early intervention may be much more feasible in the 1990s. 2. Supplemental sodium and water in children with polyuria and intravascular volume depletion may prevent growth failure. Cow milk is detrimental in this group of individuals because of high solute and protein load, often causing intravascular volume depletion, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. 3. Children with acquired glomerular disease may need sodium restriction and, if treated with steroids, a diet low in saturated fat. 4. Children with nephrotic syndrome and severe edema should be evaluated for malabsorption and subsequent malnutrition. Protein intake should be supplemented only at the RDA and to replace ongoing losses. Long-term sodium restriction is appropriate. Hyperlipidemia should be monitored: if nephrosis is chronic, a low saturated fat diet should be instituted. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can decrease urinary protein loss and may ameliorate hyperlipidemia. Children resistant to therapy can have very high morbidity. 5. Children with <50 % of normal creatinine clearance should have PTH measured and activated vitamin D therapy should be started if PTH is elevated more than two to three times normal. Thereafter careful monitoring of calcium, phosphorus, and PTH is crucial to prevent renal osteodystrophy, low turnover bone disease, and hypercalcemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. 6. Children with tubular defects with severe polyuria also may benefit from low-solute, high-volume feedings. 7. All physicians caring for children with renal disease should have pediatric nephrology consultation available. Prevention of growth failure is much more cost effective than pharmacologic therapy. Before initiating growth hormone treatment for growth retardation, assiduous treatment of co-existing renal osteodystrophy and provision of optimal nutritional intake should be accomplished.", 
    "494": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study beginning 4 weeks after uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction, it was established that the baseline plasma tissue factor antigen level was significantly higher in patients with myocardial infarction than in control subjects, and enalapril therapy significantly reduced the elevated plasma tissue factor antigen level. This may be associated with the reduction in the risk of coronary thrombosis seen with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "495": "Chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common disease responsible for a high mortality and morbidity whose clinical course can be improved by angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition. However, limited data are available on the effects of ACE inhibitors on the onset and progression of CHF in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The present study was performed as a substudy of the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation trial and involved 1,146 patients with anterior wall AMI not undergoing thrombolysis with the exclusion of patients with prior history or clinical signs of CHF on admission. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with zofenopril (7.5 to 30 mg twice daily) or placebo for a cumulative period of 6 weeks. The prevalence of CHF, either mild to moderate or severe, has been the main objective and has been evaluated 6 weeks and 1 year after AMI. The overall prevalence of CHF was not reduced by zofenopril after both 6 weeks and 12 months. Conversely the prevalence of severe CHF (1.6% vs 2.6%: risk reduction 55.5%; 95% confidence interval 9 to 63; p = 0.0325) and the combined occurrence of death or severe CHF (4.8% vs 8.2%: risk reduction 59%; 95% confidence interval 11 to 71; p = 0.024) were reduced after 6 weeks of treatment with zofenopril. Moreover, the percentage of patients experiencing a deterioration to severe CHF after 1 year was significantly reduced with zofenopril (11.0% vs 24.3%; p = 0.001). In conclusion, the early administration of zofenopril to patients with AMI attenuates the progression of the clinical symptoms of CHF and its clinical consequences, suggesting that ACE inhibitors should be regarded as a suitable strategy for the prevention and treatment of CHF in patients with AMI.", 
    "496": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may exert some of their benefits in the therapy of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction by their improvement of endothelial dysfunction.

The constrictive responses to acetylcholine were comparable in the placebo (n = 54) and quinapril (n = 51) groups at baseline. After 6 months, only the quinapril group showed significant net improvement in response to incremental concentrations of acetylcholine (4.5 +/- 3.0% [mean +/- SEM] versus -0.1 +/- 2.8% at 10(-6) mol/L and 12.1 +/- 3.0% versus -0.8 +/- 2.9% at 10(-4) mol/L, quinapril versus placebo, respectively; overall P = .002).", 
    "498": "TREND shows that ACE inhibition with quinapril improved endothelial dysfunction in patients who were normotensive and who did not have severe hyperlipidemia or evidence of heart failure.

Although the mechanism of angioedema is not certain, bradykinin has been implicated in its pathogenesis. Compared with Caucasians, African Americans are at an increased risk of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema, independent of ACE inhibitor dose or concurrent medications. Because urinary kallikrein levels are decreased in African Americans with hypertension, we hypothesized that endogenous bradykinin levels may be decreased in African Americans and that they therefore may be more sensitive to ACE inhibitor-induced increases in bradykinin or to exogenous bradykinin.",

To assess anatomical and functional characteristics of renal artery aneurysms, renal angiogram, MRI, intravenous pyelography, ultrasonography and radionuclide renography were performed. Two patent saccular renal artery aneurysms were demonstrated in the left kidney by renal angiogram. A larger, thrombosed aneurysm was also depicted on the left side on ultrasonography, MRI and renal angiogram. The larger aneurysm was responsible for renovascular disease of the middle third of the kidney, as demonstrated by captopril and baseline radionuclide renographic studies.

    "505": "The renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis in mammals. In this study, we subjected transgenic mice containing a human renin genomic construct to a variety of pharmacological and physiological manipulations to test whether expression of the human renin gene and release of active human renin in appropriately regulated in this model. These manipulations were designed to test major regulators of renin release, including angiotensin II, the macula densa, renal perfusion pressure, and beta-adrenergic receptors. We used human plasma renin concentration and human renal renin mRNA levels to document the response of the transgene to these stimuli. Human plasma renin concentration increased in response to both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril and isoproterenol and decreased after a high salt diet. A low salt or sodium-deficient diet did not stimulate renin release. Human renin mRNA levels in kidney increased after captopril but were unchanged in the other experimental groups. We also measured the levels of human renin mRNA in double transgenic mice containing the same human renin gene in addition to the human angiotensinogen gene. These mice are chronically hypertensive and have increased circulating levels of angiotensin II. Human renin mRNA levels in the kidney were paradoxically elevated compared with their single transgenic normotensive counterparts. These transgenic mice provide a model for examination of human renin regulation and may help elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the gene in response to physiological cues.", 
    "506": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is accompanied by a structural remodeling of the myocardium that includes myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial and perivascular fibrosis of intramyocardial coronary arteries. The structural abnormalities related to fibrous tissue accumulation lead to increased myocardial diastolic stiffness and ultimately impaired systolic function of the left ventricle. It has been shown in 14-week-old SHR with early hypertensive heart disease that myocardial fibrosis could be reversed and myocardial diastolic stiffness normalized by 12-week treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. Whether such functional defects of the myocardium, based on adverse structural changes, are also reversible in advanced hypertensive heart disease has been questioned. Therefore, we treated 78-week-old male SHR that had chronic hypertension and advanced LVH with severe myocardial fibrosis and age- and sex-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) with 20 mg/kg per day oral lisinopril for 8 months. Compared with untreated SHR or WKY, we found the following: (1) Systolic arterial pressure was normalized (P < .025) and LVH completely reversed (P < .025) in SHR, with no significant reduction in systolic arterial pressure or left ventricular mass in WKY; (2) morphometrically determined myocardial fibrosis in SHR was significantly reversed (P < .025) and associated with improved diastolic stiffness (P < .05), which was measured in the isolated heart by calculation of the stiffness constant of the myocardium; no significant changes occurred in WKY; (3) reversal of myocardial fibrosis was accompanied by an increase (P < .025) in myocardial matrix metalloproteinase 1 activity determined by degradation of [14C]collagen with myocardial tissue extracts after trypsin activation of myocardial promatrix metalloproteinase 1; matrix metalloproteinase 1 activity remained unchanged in WKY treated with lisinopril; and (4) systolic dysfunction, measured by a significantly (P < .025) diminished slope of the systolic stress-strain relation under isovolumic conditions of the left ventricle, was found in 110-week-old SHR, and it could be prevented by lisinopril treatment. Thus, long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with lisinopril normalized arterial pressure and LVH, reversed myocardial fibrosis, and improved abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness in advanced hypertensive heart disease in SHR. In addition, systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle could be prevented. The fibrolytic response to lisinopril was at least partly due to enhanced collagen degradation by activation of tissue matrix metalloproteinase 1.", 
    "507": "Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by L-arginine analogues such as N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is associated with malignant hypertension and enhanced expression of the endothelin-1 gene in some blood vessels. In this study, SHR treated chronically with L-NAME (SHR-L-NAME) were given the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril or the endothelin-A/endothelin-B receptor antagonist bosentan for 3 weeks. Systolic pressure was lowered slightly by cilazapril (213 +/- 2 versus 229 +/- 2 mm Hg in untreated SHR-L-NAME, P < .01) but was not significantly lowered by bosentan (223 +/- 2 mm Hg). Hypertrophy of aorta and small arteries (coronary, renal, mesenteric, and femoral) was decreased by cilazapril treatment and unaffected by bosentan. Expression of the endothelin-1 gene was evaluated in SHR-L-NAME by in situ hybridization histochemistry, which showed that endothelin-1 expression was enhanced in the endothelium of aorta but not in small mesenteric arteries in these rats. The absence of enhancement of endothelin-1 gene expression in small arteries may account for the absence of increased severity of hypertrophy of small vessels in SHR-L-NAME and may be a mechanism whereby L-NAME inhibits cardiovascular growth. These results suggest that in the absence of enhanced small-artery endothelin-1 expression, endothelin antagonism does not lower blood pressure. The blood pressure-lowering effect of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition suggests a role for the renin-angiotensin system in the malignant form of hypertension that develops in SHR treated with L-NAME.",

    "510": "Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, is widely used clinically to manage hypertension and congestive heart failure. Here captopril is shown to be an inhibitor of angiogenesis able to block neovascularization induced in the rat cornea. Captopril acted directly and specifically on capillary endothelial cells, inhibiting their chemotaxis with a biphasic dose-response curve showing an initial decrease at clinically achievable doses under 10 microM and a further slow decline in the millimolar range. Captopril inhibition of endothelial cell migration was not mediated by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, but was suppressed by zinc. Direct inhibition by captopril of zinc-dependent endothelial cell-derived 72-and 92-kD metalloproteinases known to be essential for angiogenesis was also seen. When used systemically on rats captopril inhibited corneal neovascularization and showed the antitumor activity expected of an inhibitor of angiogenesis, decreasing the number of mitoses present in carcinogen-induced foci of preneoplastic liver cells and slowing the growth rate of an experimental fibrosarcoma whose cells were resistant to captopril in vitro. These data define this widely used drug as a new inhibitor of neovascularization and raise the possibility that patients on long term captopril therapy may derive unexpected benefits from its antiangiogenic activities.",

    "523": "Pig kidney aminopeptidase P (AP-P; EC 3.4.11.9) has been purified to homogeneity after its solubilisation from brush border membranes by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The effects of various activators and inhibitors of AP-P activity have been examined with a number of different substrates for the enzyme. The hydrolysis of bradykinin and ArgProPro is inhibited at Mn2+ concentrations above 10(-5) M, whereas the hydrolysis of other substrates (GlyProHyp, beta-casomorphin, substance P) is substantially activated, with 4-10 mM Mn2+ being optimal. The thiol reagent, p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonic acid, inhibits the hydrolysis of GlyProHyp but markedly activates the hydrolysis of bradykinin. A number of inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1), previously reported to inhibit the hydrolysis of GlyProHyp, have no effect on the hydrolysis of bradykinin except in the presence of Mn2+. Differences were also observed in the degree of inhibition of GlyProHyp and bradykinin hydrolysis by EDTA and their reactivation by divalent cations. The hydrolysis of GlyProHyp follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 2.7 mM. Bradykinin inhibits GlyProHyp hydrolysis with an I50 of 1.4 microM. The hydrolysis of bradykinin by AP-P reveals anomalous nonlinear kinetics indicative of negative cooperativity or the presence of more than one active site for this substrate.

The life expectancy of hypertensive patients is known to depend on the degree of damage caused to their target organs by the hypertension itself. Cardiovascular hypertrophy and its complications are considered to be among the major elements of this process. This work evaluates the effectiveness of the long-term treatment of essential hypertensive subjects (n = 10) with a long-acting ACE-inhibitor, cilazapril, as concerns their blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy. Cilazapril given orally in a daily dose of 2.5 mg effectively lowered both the systolic (delta 30 mm Hg) and the diastolic (delta 19 mm Hg) blood pressure. No changes were found in body weight or heart rate, and only one side-effects (skin rash) was reported. Cilazapril considerably decreased the left ventricular mass and hence the hypertrophic index of hypertensive patients with cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that ACE inhibitors are effective not only in lowering blood pressure and decreasing hypertrophy, but also in lowering the cardiac morbidity and mortality.",

It is still unknown if this effect is restricted to this patient group only and by which mechanisms ACE-inhibitors exhibit the profibrinolytic effects. One possible explanation might be the positive influence of ACE-inhibitors on insulin metabolism by decreasing plasma insulin which in turn could decrease PAI-1, a major regulator of the fibrinolytic system. Therefore the present study examines the relationship between insulin and PAI-1 plasma levels during intravenous glucose tolerance tests before and after administration with the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril in 12 male obese patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease and borderline hypertension. After a 4-weeks wash-out period glucose tolerance tests were performed before and after lisinopril-treatment (10mgs/d) for 12 weeks. After the treatment period, fasting plasma insulin level decreased from 15.6 +/- 2.1 to 11 +/- 1.8 uU/ml, p < or = 0.01. Stimulated levels of insulin during glucose tolerance test also significantly decreased by lisinopril (peak insulin from 57 +/- 10 to 41.2 +/- 7.3 uU/ml, p < or = 0.02). Basal plasma tissue plasminogen activator antigen, PAI-1 total antigen and PAI-1 \"active\" antigen were unaffected by therapy (8.4 +/- 0.5 vs 8.6 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, 118 +/- 20 vs 124 +/- 16 ng/ml and 21 +/- 7 vs 30 +/- 7 ng/ml, respectively). Our data confirm a beneficial effect of lisinopril on plasma levels of insulin but failed to demonstrate any profibrinolytic effect in this study population, thus questioning the postulated mechanism of influencing endogenous fibrinolysis by changes of plasma insulin.",

The mortality for definite myocardial infarction was 13.7% (< 70 years 7.1%). Coronary angiography was performed on 10% of patients during their hospital admission, and 4.9% underwent revascularisation. Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 52% (495/948) of patients with definite infarction and 4% had contraindications. Patients aged > or = 70 years (47% vs 55% p = 0.02) or diabetics (46% vs 56%, p = 0.04) were less likely to receive thrombolysis. The utilisation of aspirin and oral beta-blockers was 86% and 40%, respectively, in patients with definite infarction and both were used less frequently in patients > or = 70 years. Intravenous beta-blockers were administered to < 1% of patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were prescribed in 21%, intravenous or long acting nitrates in 41% and calcium antagonists in 14%; the latter two therapies were used more frequently in patients > or = 70 years.

There is, however, still some uncertainty concerning the usefulness of acting preventively on so-called microhypertension; in other words, whether early antihypertensive drug treatment can prevent diabetic nephropathy. This paper discusses the criteria to be followed in the choice of antihypertensive medication during diabetic nephropathy giving special attention to pathophysiological considerations. Moreover, it also discusses the effects of antihypertensive drugs currently regarded as first-choice agents, i.e. calcium antagonists and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, on intrarenal hemodynamics.",

Patients whose conventionally measured diastolic blood pressure after 4 weeks' treatment was not normalised (diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) received the higher dosage (verapamil SR/trandolapril 180/2 mg o.d.) for a further 4 weeks. Clinical evaluations including measurement of blood pressure were performed every 2 weeks. A 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed at weeks 0, 4 and 8 (end of the study). The mean office blood pressure decreased from 155 +/- 11/104 +/- 4 mmHg at baseline to 139 +/- 9/89 +/- 6 mmHg at week 8. In 12 patients (60%), the diastolic blood pressure was normalised after week 4. In eight patients, the dosage was increased and, of these, a further 25% were normalised at week 8. Response, defined as a reduction of diastolic blood pressure to < or approximately 90 mmHg (normalisation) or a decrease of at least 10 mmHg compared to baseline, was recorded in 18 patients (90%). The mean 24-h ABPM was reduced from 143 +/- 15/85 +/- 9 mmHg at baseline to 131 +/- 11/77 +/- 8 mmHg at week 8. The average systolic and diastolic blood pressure was reduced by a statistically significant amount (11/9 mmHg) during the day (8.00 am-10.00 pm) and 11/7 mmHg during the night (10.00 pm-8.00 am). Diurnal variation did not change. Only mild to moderate adverse events such as slight isolated elevations of SGPT, SGOT and potassium were observed. Two patients discontinued the study prematurely due to impotence which began during the placebo run-in period. No adverse events were serious or required any medical treatment. The fixed combination of verapamil SR and trandolapril appear to be a very effective and well-tolerated once-a-day antihypertensive medication.",

    "543": "In our study the effects of angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and immunosuppressant agent d-penicillamine were investigated on inflammations mediated by kinins and on adjuvant arthritis in rat paw oedema tests. Kinins mediated inflammations were increased by small doses of captopril (0.04-5 mg/kg per os) in a dose dependent manner. However this effect of captopril was reduced at higher doses of the drug (5-400 mg/kg). In the case of d-penicillamine there was exerted an inflammation increasing effect similarly to captopril. Maximum value of this action could be measured at dose 100 mg/kg per os. After administration higher doses of d-penicillamine were not revealed any depression in inflammation increasing effect. In capillary resistance studies we have shown capillary resistance increasing action of captopril that was dose depend. However this effect was not found in the case of d-penicillamine. According to these finding kinins mediated inflammation increasing effects of captopril and d-penicillamine are suggested as a results of their ability inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme. Maximum depression at higher doses of captopril may be caused by its capillary resistance elevating action. In chronic inflammations studies we have shown developments of secondary symptoms of adjuvant arthritis inhibiting effects of captopril and d-penicillamine in a dose dependent manner. We assume that immunosuppressive action of both drug are responsible for reduction of chronic inflammations. Our study strengthens the argument that captopril can be used in therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. Further clinicopharmacological studies of captopril may clarify the role of this drug in therapy of rheumatoid diseases.",

Hypocalemia (serum potassium < 3.8mEq/L or serum potassium reductions > or = 0.9mEq/ L) occurred in nine patients of the CL group (CL H). In this group CL therapy induced increments in the area under the curve of glycemia during OGTT (582 vs 610mg/h/dL, p < 0.05) that were not observed in the normocalemic patients of the CL (CLN) or Cp groups. Serum insulin levels during OGTT did not change with active therapy in all three groups. The insulin sensitivity index, however, decreased significantly in the CLH (1.9 vs 1.4; p < 0.05) and CLN (10.1 vs 4.3, p < 0.05) but remained unchanged in the Cp group (3.1 vs 2.5; NS).

'Evidence-based' practice is essential but extrapolation to the individual patient is always necessary and this fact is well illustrated by data from trials of ACE inhibitors post-myocardial infarction. In the AIRE (Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy) study, 2,006 patients with some evidence of heart failure, even if transient, after a myocardial infarction, were randomised to receive oral ramipril or placebo in addition to standard treatment. Follow-up was for a minimum of six and an average of 15 months. The risk reduction in total mortality was 27% (95% CI 11-40%; p = 0.002); approximately 40 lives might be expected to be saved for every 1000 patients treated for one year. Benefit was apparent within weeks of starting treatment. Additional data from the AIRE study are considered in relation to the findings of other mortality trials.

    "551": "There are a number of effective therapies to consider for the patient after myocardial infarction (MI). Careful patient assessment and individualisation of treatment is required for maximum benefit. Key aspects of assessment include consideration of continuing myocardial ischaemia, evaluation of LV function, review of risk factors and patient circumstances relevant to rehabilitation. Thrombolysis for eligible patients and acute aspirin are of proven benefit and the priority is to minimise delay in treatment. Aspirin is indicated long term for all patients. Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and possibly nitrates are also beneficial, but questions remain about optimal timing and combination treatment. Anticoagulants should be considered in selected, high-risk patients. Education-counselling measures should be initiated in hospital and continued with risk-factor modification as part of rehabilitation after discharge. Priority should be given to smoking cessation where applicable, and to reduction of elevated serum cholesterol levels.",

However, the initial results strongly indicate that either a lack of decrease or an increase in left ventricular mass after antihypertensive treatment is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, the latter being significantly reduced and almost normalised by a complete reversal of LVH.", 
    "553": "The ACE inhibitors have been found effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of both post-infarction patients and those with chronic systolic left ventricular dysfunction. However, their use is limited--particularly in elderly patients because of poor tolerance partly due to bradykinin-induced side-effects such as renal dysfunction, first-dose hypotension, and cough. Thus, the introduction of the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonists--that block the effects of angiotensin II without increasing bradykinin concentration--may be particularly important in the treatment of elderly patients. The role of the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonists in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction is currently being explored in direct comparison with and in conjunction with the ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, important questions about the most effective dose of ACE inhibitor and ACE inhibitor use in conjunction with aspirin and the NSAIDs still have to be answered. Thus, although we have learnt much about the role of ACE inhibitors in heart failure treatment, we are still at an early stage in the application of this knowledge, particularly in elderly patients.", 
    "554": "The effect of chronic oral treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril at antihypertensive and sub-antihypertensive doses, on vascular morphology and function as well as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and cardiac capillary length density was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Treatment was commenced before hypertension developed (prevention study) or in adult animals with established hypertension (regression study). In both studies, high-dose ramipril reduced ACE activity in plasma, heart and aorta, normalised blood pressure, and prevented LVH or caused regression of LVH. Low-dose ramipril did not prevent the development of hypertension or LVH, but caused an increase in cardiac capillary length density. In adult hypertensive animals, low-dose ramipril did not reduce blood pressure but caused regression of LVH. In both studies, vascular function as tested in the aortic vessels was improved not only after high- but also after low-dose ACE inhibitor treatment: an inhibition of vascular ACE was associated with attenuated vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine and enhanced dilator responses to acetylcholine and bradykinin. A reduction of vascular hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the mesenteric vessels was achieved by the antihypertensive dose of ramipril in the prevention but not the regression study. Our data demonstrate that an improvement of vascular function in SHR can be achieved by chronic ACE inhibition with ramipril independently of structural changes and of the antihypertensive action exerted by the drug. LVH was reduced even at a sub-antihypertensive dose of ramipril in the regression but not the prevention study. In the prevention study, however, low-dose ramipril, like high-dose ramipril, was able to protect the heart by preventing cardiac microvascular rarefaction.",

Here we investigated whether in a model of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis long-lasting proteinuria resulted in renal structural damage and whether chronic treatment with perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lowered proteinuria and retarded disease progression. Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), a model of human membranous nephropathy, was induced with 0.5 ml/100 g of rabbit anti-Fx1 A antibody in 26 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were then divided into two groups of 13 rats each, given daily vehicle or perindopril (1 mg/kg p.o). Treatment started at day 7 when proteinuria was already present and lasted 12 months. An additional group of normal rats was used as control. Renal biopsies were taken at months 8 and 12. Untreated PHN rats showed a significant increase in systolic blood pressure starting from month 8, that was normalized by perindopril administration. Urinary protein excretion progressively increased with time in untreated PHN rats that developed focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage. Perindopril significantly reduced proteinuria and limited glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury. Urinary excretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), two major mediators of renal damage in other models of glomerulonephritis, increased with time in PHN but only the former correlated with the degree of glomerulosclerosis. The effect of perindopril on proteinuria and renal structural damage was associated with a significant reduction in urinary ET-1 but not TGF-beta 1, suggesting that ET-1 may be an important determinant of disease progression in experimental membranous nephropathy.",

The goal of the study was to determine whether stimulation of endogenous angiotensin production by applying renin to the brain surface has an effect on pial arteriolar caliber and CBF. Pial vessel diameters were measured through a closed cranial window in anesthetized rabbits. Percent changes of blood flow in the cortical area under the cranial window were simultaneously measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Topical application of 0.01-0.1 U/ml renin induced maximum dilation of 18.9 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD) of pial arterioles within 2 min. Arteriolar calibers thereafter decreased slowly. Flow gradually increased to peak at 38 +/- 15% 50 min after renin application. Angiotensin I levels in jugular blood, as measured by radioimmunoassay, increased to a peak 40 min after topical renin application. Angiotensin II levels in jugular blood and both angiotensin I and II levels in blood samples from the femoral artery did not change. Diameter and flow changes were inhibited by intravenous pretreatment with the converting enzyme blocker captopril (10 mg/kg body wt i.v.). Captopril did not affect the vasodilation and flow increase in response to hypercapnia. Topically applied captopril (10(-5) M) blocked renin-induced arteriolar dilation. We conclude that renin increases pial arteriolar diameters and cortical blood flow in the rabbit brain. Stimulation of angiotensin production is likely to be a mediator of this response.", 
    "568": "The introduction of nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonists in clinical use has necessarily led to comparison with the various and clinically established angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In essence, losartan, the first approved angiotensin receptor antagonist, has a clinical profile highly similar to that of the converting-enzyme inhibitors, although much higher doses are required but with the advantage of no dry cough. On the other hand, the emergence of the concept of inverse agonism on other receptor systems has led to the search for pathological situations mediated through constitutive receptor activity as well as antagonists with inverse agonistic properties on the angiotensin receptor. Basic research on angiotensin peptide antagonists has led to the identification of molecular characteristics that produce antagonism. The combination of these characteristics then led to angiotensin antagonists that possessed a long in vivo duration of action. Studies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and nonpeptide antagonists on animal models of post-angioplastic restenosis revealed that both classes of compounds have similar partial efficacy on the inhibition of neointima formation. A peptide antagonist produced on the rat carotid model a complete inhibition of neointima formation. This increased efficacy is now tentatively attributed to potential inverse agonistic activity of this peptide antagonist. This concept would give angiotensin antagonists therapeutic opportunities where convertase inhibitors should be ineffective.",

Whether the decrease in collagen induced by converting-enzyme inhibition is due in vivo to pressure mechanisms or to nonhemodynamic factors or a combination of both remains the subject of discussion. In this review, it will be shown that (i) converting-enzyme inhibition prevents the accumulation of aortic collagen in hypertensive rats independently of blood pressure changes, (ii) prevention of aortic collagen accumulation in hypertensive rats is obtained through blockade of angiotensin II formation involving AT1 receptors, and (iii) in hypertensive humans, increased aortic stiffness is associated with AGTR1 receptor polymorphism independently of age and blood pressure.", 
    "570": "In this review paper, three aspects related to alteration in capillary permeability, based on a series of recent observations from this laboratory, are examined. Firstly, the determinants of capillary extravasation, which include pre- and post-capillary resistances in different microcirculation networks, as well as endothelial permeability per se, are described with particular reference to the heterogeneous character of both regulatory components, reported by this and other groups. Secondly, the endothelium-interstitium relationship, responsible in part for the maintenance of the interstitial compartment physicochemical characteristics, is introduced as an important factor in regulating the traffic of vital nutrients delivered to the cell mass, and the removal of waste products from the cellular compartment to the microcirculation, for ultimate excretion. Examined in this manner, it appears that modulation of capillary permeability is essential for the maintenance of cellular life, yet the neurohumoral mechanisms involved in the control of microcirculation networks are just starting to be identified. A number of morbid conditions characterized by multiorgan involvement exhibit a common pathophysiological denominator which involves endothelium-interstitium relationships, as illustrated in experimental animal models of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and degenerative renal diseases. Enhanced capillary permeability associated with local interstitial edema in specific organs, such as the heart and the kidney, in arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, as well as decreased permeability in peripheral tissues, such as the skeletal muscle and the skin, in congenital cardiomyopathy, have been documented. It is likely that alteration in the characteristics of interstitial matrix composition contributes to target organ damage in these examples of systemic disorders from different etiologies. Thirdly, the recent identification of autocoids and hormones involved in the direct and indirect control of capillary permeability has led to the development of pharmacological tools capable of modulating pre- and post-capillary vascular tonus, as well as endothelial permeability. Angiotensin II antagonism, bradykinin B1-receptor inhibition, and modulation of eicosanoid production, in particular thromboxane A2, are associated in some of the above-described disorders, with normalization of capillary permeability defects, and occasionally with improvement in organ function. The eventual development of agents capable of directly controlling the physicochemical characteristics of the interstitial matrix should be of interest, not only for preventing the development of irreversible matrix structural alterations but also for facilitating the traffic of metabolites between capillaries and the cell mass of vital organs.",

To investigate the existence of a link between the effects of pressure and Ang II and to explore the mechanisms underlying such a relationship, we quantified the effect of Ang II and Ang II inhibitors on the pressure-dependent FN expression in a 3-day organ culture model of rabbit aorta using immunolabeling analysis and detected FN mRNAs by in situ hybridization. A dose-dependent effect of Ang II on FN expression was observed at both 80 and 150 mm Hg but not at 0 mm Hg (relaxed vessels). One mumol/L Ang II increased the media cross-sectional surface, showing FN expression from 7.9 +/- 0.7% (n = 9) to 18.9 +/- 1.1% (n = 4) at 80 mm Hg (P < .01) and from 17.4 +/- 1.8% (n = 9) to 56.6% +/- 3.6 (n = 4) at 150 mm Hg (P < .001). In situ hybridization revealed that Ang II and pressure upregulated FN mRNA expression. Losartan, an AT1 antagonist, not only blocked the Ang II effect but also inhibited the transmural pressure effect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition abolished the pressure-dependent FN expression and significantly diminished the effect of pressure in the presence of Ang II. The effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors was specific for FN, since neither bFGF nor laminin expression was affected by these agents. Taken together, the results demonstrate that (1) the effect of transmural pressure is mediated by the stimulation of a local renin-angiotensin system, resulting in a net Ang II production in the culture medium, (2) transmural pressure and Ang II act synergistically to enhance vascular FN expression, (3) AT1 receptors mediate both the effects of pressure and of exogenous Ang II, and (4) the effect of Ang II on FN expression is regulated at a pretranslational level.", 
    "572": "Cells capable of de novo angiotensin (Ang)II generation in the heart remain unidentified. High-density angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) binding has been localized to sites of high collagen turnover, such as heart valve leaflets and their valvular interstitial cells (VIC). VIC express ACE mRNA and their membrane-bound ACE utilizes AngI as substrate. Whether VIC also express angiotensinogen (Ao) and an aspartyl protease, and whether they generate AngI and II de novo, is presently unknown. We sought to address these questions in serum-deprived cultured VIC. Ao, renin and cathepsin D (Cat-D) mRNA expression was addressed by RT-PCR. Production of Ao, AngI and AngII peptides were measured in VIC-culture media by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Immunoreactive Cat-D was detected by immunofluorescein labeling and Western blotting. Cat-D and renin activities were determined by spectrofluorometric and autoradiographic methods and AngI generation by RIA. Results showed (a) expression of Ao and Cat-D both at mRNA and protein levels; (b) AngI and AngII peptides in culture media; (c) acceleration of AngII production by exogenous AngI (1 nmol/l), which was blocked by lisinopril (0.1 mumol/l); (d) that dexamethasone (0.1 mumol/l) increased AngII production; (e) a 46 kDa immunoreactive Cat-D protein by Western blotting; (f) aspartyl protease activity, using chromogenic and 125I-labeled Ao as substrates, inhibited by pepstatin-A; and (g) the absence of renin mRNA and activity. It is concluded that at both the mRNA and protein levels, cultured VIC express Ao and Cat-D, and can generate AngI and AngII peptides by the action of a non-renin protease Cat-D and ACE, respectively. VIC therefore appear to represent a constitutive nonendothelial cell found in adult rat heart valve leaflets, which are capable of de novo Ang peptide generation.", 
    "573": "Of the three physiopathological types of cardiomyopathy, dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive, it is the first which characteristically shows major left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The left ventricular volumes are increased, the ventricle becomes spherical and global ejection fraction decreases with diffuse or segmental wall motion abnormalities. The left ventricular mass is increased in an excentrical fashion with wall thinning. Isovolumic contraction is slower, the ejection time is shorter and, above all, the indices of contractility such as maximal velocity of the contractile elements ... are very abnormal and do not improve after positive inotropic stimulation.", 
    "574": "Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography has been used to study patients during and after myocardial infarction. Quantitative studies have revealed that progressive increase in left ventricular size is associated with a poor prognosis. When pre-defined echocardiographic criteria were used to stratify infarction patients for adverse cardiovascular outcome, the efficacy of combined thrombolysis and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy could be shown in those who developed left ventricular enlargement. Other descriptors of left ventricular architecture and function, such as cavity shape and the ratio of short-axis left ventricular muscle to cavity area, may predict cardiovascular death and severe heart failure.", 
    "575": "A postmarketing surveillance study was undertaken to confirm the efficacy and safety of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril and to extend the findings of controlled clinical trials into real-world conditions. A total of 11,100 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension treated by primary care physicians were enrolled in this 8-week, open-label study. Ramipril was usually initiated at a dosage of 2.5 mg once daily and titrated to achieve target blood pressure. Efficacy was assessed in 8261 patients for whom blood pressure data were recorded after the start of treatment: safety was assessed in all patients. Of patients with combined systolic and diastolic hypertension, 86.0% achieved a final diastolic blood pressure of < or = 90 mm Hg or a > or = 10 mm Hg decrease from baseline; the highest response was seen in elderly patients (87.2%), and the lowest response was seen in black patients (81.2%). Of patients with isolated systolic hypertension, 70.4% achieved a final systolic blood pressure of < or = 140 mm Hg or a > or = 20 mm Hg decrease from baseline, including 70.6% of women, 70.3% of men, and 69.1% of elderly patients; the highest response was seen in white patients (71.8%), and the lowest response was seen in black patients (64.4%). Adverse events were generally mild; cough (3.0%) was the most frequent. Once-daily ramipril was effective and well tolerated during an 8-week period in a large, diverse population of patients who had mild-to-moderate hypertension and who were treated by primary care physicians.", 
    "576": "It is suggested that Borrelia burgdorferi infection could be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). Stanek et al. were able to cultivate Borrelia burgdorferi from myocardial biopsy tissue of a patient with longstanding dilated cardiomyopathy. Here we present a study in which we examined the effect of standard antibiotic treatment on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy associated with Borrelia burgdorferi infection. In this study we assessed the serum (IgG, IgM Elisa) and history of 46 IDC patients with specific regard to Borrelia burgdorferi infection (mean LVEF 30.4 +/- 1.3%, measured by cardiac catheterization and echocardiography with the length-area-volume method). All 46 patients received standard treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy: ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics. Eleven (24%) patients showed positive serology and a history of Borrelia burgdorferi infection; nine of these also had a typical history of tick bite and erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) and/or other organ involvement, and two had no recollection of tick bite or ECM but showed other Borrelia burgdorferi-associated disorders (neuropathy, oligoarthritis). These 11 patients with Borrelia burgdorferi infection received standard antibiotic treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g bid for 14 days. Six (55%) recovered completely and showed a normal LVEF after 6 months, three (27%) improved their LVEF, and two (18%) did not improve at all. This amounts to nine (82%) patients with recovery/improvement in the Borrelia burgdorferi group. The 35 patients who did not show positive serology or a history of Borrelia burgdorferi infection did not receive antibiotic treatment. In this group without Borrelia burgdorferi infection 12 (26%), showed recovery/improvement following the standard treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy (see earlier). Our results indicate that Borrelia burgdorferi infection could play a decisive role in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in a geographical region such as Graz, where Borrelia burgdorferi is endemic. While we are aware of the small number of Borrelia burgdorferi patients in this study, we nevertheless conclude that in a remarkable number of patients with signs of Borrelia burgdorferi infection, dilated cardiomyopathy could be reversed and LVEF improved.", 
    "577": "We studied the changes in left ventricular (LV) diastolic function induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition at rest and during adrenergic stimulation and their relation to blood pressure (BP) variations to determine whether reductions in the renin-angiotensin system may improve diastolic function irrespective of BP reduction. Echocardiographic indices of systolic and diastolic function, plasma catecholamines as estimated by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and BP variations (Dynamap) were determined at rest and during the cold pressor test (CPT) before and 6 hours and 20 days after ACE inhibition (lisinopril), 20 mg/day by mouth in 10 subjects with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Blood Pressure was significantly reduced after both 6 hours and 20 days of therapy. The cold pressor test induced similar increases in BP in both basal conditions and after acute and chronic treatment. Catecholamine levels were unchanged by the therapy. Systolic function, evaluated by fractional shortening, ejection fraction, and systolic dV/dt, was normal and unchanged during CPT and after treatment. Diastolic function, assessed by volume curve analysis, showed a reduced percentage contribution of rapid filling to total diastolic filling, an increase in the contribution of the atrial systole, and an increase in the isovolumetric relaxation time. During CPT these parameters deteriorated further in response to increased afterload. Lisinopril therapy induced significant increases in end-diastolic volume (p < 0.005) with a progressive increase in the rapid filling dV/dt (p < 0.005 at rest; p < 0.001 during CPT) and a reduction in isovolumetric relaxation (p < 0.0001 at rest and p < 0.01 during CPT). The correlation between systolic BP (afterload) and the rapid filling dV/dt, both at rest and during CPT, was modified by treatment with the ACE inhibitor, with significantly higher rapid filling dV/dt values, and with the pressure loads equal (reduction of the slope and rightward shift of the correlation line). The improvement in diastolic function achieved by ACE inhibition at rest and during CPT appears unrelated to plasma catecholamines and only partly ascribable to the reduced pressure load. The tissue angiotensin II reduction might by itself improve the myocardial response to the pressure load and adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "578": "The antihypertensive activity and safety of losartan, a specific and selective antagonist of angiotensin II (subtype 1) receptors, was evaluated in 100 inpatients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 2-week, single-blind, out patient placebo lead-in period, the last 2 days of which included inpatient monitoring of baseline blood pressure, the patients were assigned randomly to receive once-daily doses of either placebo; 50, 100, or 150 mg losartan; or 10 mg enalapril. Patients were treated double blind for 5 days, followed by a day for the study of drug withdrawal. Beginning with the first dose, the three doses of losartan and enalapril significantly decreased peak and trough systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared with placebo (p < or = 0.05). The area under the blood pressure curve was analyzed as an assessment of total blood pressure change throughout the day. On day 1, total blood pressure reduction with losartan (50-150 mg) was slightly less than with enalapril. By day 5 of double-blind treatment, the reduction in blood pressure in these groups was similar, suggesting that losartan has a slower onset of action than enalapril. No rebound hypertension was observed after study-drug discontinuation. Losartan was well tolerated in this trial, with an adverse event profile similar to placebo and enalapril.", 
    "579": "This review explores whether the therapeutic attractiveness of renin inhibitors compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, is sufficient to warrant continued interest in their development for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Clinical and experimental data available to date indicate that patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure will benefit from renin inhibition. However, clinical experience is very limited, and extra benefits of renin inhibitors compared with the other blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have yet to be demonstrated. Some experimental data in animals and humans point to a greater effect of acute renin inhibition on renal blood flow than other modes of interference with the RAS. Again, the clinical benefits of such an effect, and particularly after long-term treatment, in hypertension and renal disease need to be determined. In today's cost-conscious health setting, only new drugs that bring additional clinical benefits have a good chance of being commercially viable. It remains to be seen whether renin inhibitors will fulfill these criteria.", 
    "580": "Previous studies have reported a 4%-50% incidence of acute renal failure (ARF) following the use of radiocontrast media in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency. In these studies, ARF was defined as a rise of the serum creatinine of at least 1 mg/dl above baseline. Using the same criteria, we studied 214 patients undergoing various intravascular radiocontrast media procedures. Patients were infused with a specially prepared cocktail solution (NSMF) containing 1000 ml half-normal saline, 12.5 g of mannitol (M), I ampule NaHCO3, and 200 mg of furosemide (F) at 100 ml/h from one hour prior to two hours after the procedure. Urinary output was replaced with normal saline for at least 6 h after the procedure. Seven percent of the patients developed acute renal insufficiency. Only 3% of the patients had a rise in serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/dl. No patient required dialysis therapy after the procedure. There was one unrelated death caused by acute myocardial infarction postangioplasty. Risk factors for development of ARF despite cocktail administration included the presence of diabetes mellitus and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. We concluded that the properly administered NSMF solution protects against radiocontrast dye induced renal failure. In select patients with chronic renal insufficiency, consideration should be given to withholding ACE inhibitor therapy for 24-48 h prior to administration of intravenous radiocontrast dye. A large controlled trial will be required to establish whether the NSMF solution offers benefit beyond that of saline hydration alone.", 
    "581": "Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) was known as a rare and catastrophic syndrome responsible for acute renal failure (ARF) in a context of widespread microvascular disease occurring in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS). Following pathogenetic hypoteses, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, plasma infusions (PI), and plasma-exchange (PE) have been employed in SRC with favorable results. Our purpose was to verify whether these therapies have consistently changed the fatal prognosis of SRC, even in our experience. In the last 10 years, SRC was diagnosed in eight patients (all eight with histologic data). The first five cases were treated with steroids, antihypertensive-cocktail, and PI: all five died, two within 48 hours, three after 10, 15, and 300 days, respectively. Three other patients were treated with ACE inhibitors, PI, and PE: all three died after 1, 9, and 12 months of HD. Clinical-histological correlations showed a strong relationship between the extent of glomerular involvement and the degree of renal failure, while arterial lesions seem to be more related to the past history of PSS, independently from the previous existence of hypertension. We conclude that \"true\" SRC diagnosed by restrictive criteria is still a rare life-threatening syndrome, and, unfortunately, no clear predictive biochemical or clinical signs could be identified; vascular renal involvement correlates to the duration of PSS independently of previous clinical evidence of renal failure or hypertension; a glomerular pattern similar to that reported for hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) syndrome is directly related to the degree of acute renal involvement; SRC may occur even in the absence of hypertension, mainly if cardiomyopathy is present: in our experience. ACE inhibitors and plasma therapies have changed the short-time prognosis of SRC, but they may be unable to provide recovery from dialysis and do not avoid further evolution of extrarenal PSS exiting in late death.", 
    "582": "Diabetes mellitus is a complex group of diseases that has hyperglycemia as a common metabolic abnormality. Although it is well-known that diabetic patients are susceptible to the effects of large vessel atherosclerosis with specific cardiac and cerebral complications, the association of diabetes mellitus with cardiac dysfunction caused by cardiomyopathy in the absence of significant coronary artery disease has been recognized for many years. However, the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy remains unknown and has been somewhat controversial. Specifically, whether diabetes mellitus with its metabolic effects is sufficient to account for cardiomyopathy remains to be proven. This paper reviews the evidence for and against a metabolic etiology. In addition, we review the clinical and experimental evidence that supports the view that diabetes mellitus acts together with hypertension to produce structural damage in the heart that manifests as ventricular dysfunction and ultimately congestive heart failure. The concomitant effects of the metabolic derangements of diabetes and the vascular abnormalities associated with hypertension may lead to microvascular-induced tissue injury. Findings supporting this hypothesis are presented, along with observations suggesting that treatment with vasodilating calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be beneficial in regard to tissue pathology and mortality in experimental models. Recent clinical studies also support a role for the microcirculation in diabetics. Finally, it is suggested that if the microcirculation is pathogenetically involved in diabetic cardiomyopathy, then agents that improve microcirculatory flow along with tight control of hypertension may be as beneficial in the treatment or prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy as strict metabolic control of hyperglycemia.", 
    "583": "We tested the hypothesis that the status of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system affects insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity (by the euglycaemic insulin clamp technique) was measured in eight patients with angiographically proven renovascular hypertension and in eight normotensive subjects matched for age, gender, body mass index and glucose tolerance. In the patients, insulin sensitivity was measured both at baseline and following 7 days of ACE inhibition. Following glucose ingestion, patients and controls showed similar insulin and glucose responses. Insulin infusion (7 pmol min-1 kg-1) promoted similar glucose utilization in the hypertensives and normotensives: 24.8 +/- 2.3 vs. 26.0 +/- 3.0 mumol min-1 kg-1 respectively. One week of ACE inhibition caused a 20 +/- 4 mmHg decrease in mean blood pressure and a 20 +/- 6% decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Plasma angiotensin II concentrations dropped from 24.6 +/- 6.3 to 13.5 +/-5.0 pg mL-1 (P < 0.05) and plasma aldosterone from 17 +/- 4 to 9 +/- 2 ng dL-1 (P < 0.05), and plasma renin activity doubled (from 1.6 +/- 0.3 to 3.4 +/- 1.7 ng mL-1 h-1, P < 0.02). Nevertheless, insulin sensitivity was unchanged (before, 24.8 +/- 2.3; after 25.8 +/- 2.2 mumol min-1 kg-1, P = Ns). During insulin infusion, forearm blood flow did not change from baseline in either set of studies. Also, the antinatriuretic (before, -26 +/- 18; after, -22 +/- 14%) and antikaliuretic (before: -36 +/- 13%, after -39 +/- 11%) action of the hormone was unaffected by the therapy. In conclusion, renovascular hypertension is not associated with insulin resistance. Furthermore, a selective, drastic reduction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity and vascular tone does not alter insulin action on glucose and electrolyte metabolism.", 
    "584": "A dry, tickly and often bothersome cough is the most common adverse effect of ACE inhibitors. Recent studies indicate that cough may develop in around 10% of the patients treated with ACE inhibitors. In half of these patients, the ACE inhibitor has to be discontinued. Cough has emerged as a class effect occurring with all ACE inhibitors with no clear difference between the single substances. While ACE inhibition is safe in the vast majority of patients with obstructive airways disease, asthmatic symptoms or exacerbation of asthma as well as a rise in bronchial reactivity have been occasionally reported. ACE inhibition increases the cough reflex. The mechanisms underlying ACE inhibitor-induced cough are probably linked to suppression of kininase II activity, which may be followed by an accumulation of kinins, substance P and prostaglandins. Physicians should be aware that a dry cough is the most common adverse effect of ACE inhibitors and that this symptom may occur not necessarily shortly after institution of therapy but months or even a year later. Replacement by another ACE inhibitor should not be tried, since the cough will almost always recur on rechallenge with the same or another ACE inhibitor. After withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor, which is the treatment of choice, cough will resolve usually within a few days.",

    "589": "We investigated the effect of enalaprilat (ET) on long-term preservation of cardiac explant. Isolated rat hearts (n = 7/group) were pretreated with 0 to 40 nM ET and stored at 0 degree C for 16 h. Functional viability was assessed after 30-min working reperfusion without ET. Prestorage control function (mean +/- S.E.M.) (n = 7) included heart rate (HR), 291 +/- 12 bpm; aortic flow (AF). 49.8 +/- 1.9 ml/min; coronary flow (CF), 25.2 +/- 1.3 ml/min; cardiac output (CO), 75.0 +/- 1.2 ml/min; and work, 89.4 +/- 4.7 g-m/min. Post-storage function of untreated hearts was: AF, 61%; CF, 43%; CO, 55%; work, 48% of control. ET (20 nM) enhanced AF recovery to 85%; CF, 58%; CO, 76%; work, 73% of control (P < 0.05 v untreated). Hoe 140 (D-Arg-[Hyp2, Thi5,8, D-Phe7]BK) (1 nM) a bradykinin receptor antagonist, inhibited ET effect; function returned to the untreated level. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors staurosporine (15 nM) and bisindolylmaleimide I (0.5 microM) also blocked ET effect. After 4 h of cold storage, membrane PKC activity changed little from the prestorage level in the untreated hearts, but was elevated significantly from 52.8 +/- 5.2 pmol/min/mg to 74.7 +/- 8.2 by 20 nM ET (P < 0.05 v untreated). Cytosol PKC did not change during 4 h cold storage with or without ET. Neither end-storage nor end-reperfusion myocardial ATP content was affected by 20 nM ET treatment. In conclusion, ET improves cardiac preservation possibly via bradykinin receptor and PKC without affecting ATP metabolism.",

They are generally considered safe drugs, but there are a number of reports of angioedema associated with their use.

    "591": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether pretreatment with cyclosporine (CsA), or perindopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) would modify the ischaemia-reperfusion injury of vascular occlusion during liver resection. Rats were allocated to four groups (n = 20 for each group): (i) sham operated; (ii) liver resection only; (iii) CsA (15 mg/kg); and (iv) perindopril (4 mg/kg during the three days before ischaemia-reperfusion injury with liver resection). The ischaemia was produced by a 30 min continuous occlusion. The model was designed to study liver function tests as the principal parameter. Compared with liver resection only, bilirubin was significantly lower with perindopril on days 8 and 23, but significantly higher with CsA on days 1 and 2. The alanine aminotransferase peak (day 1) was significantly lower with both perindopril and CsA. The prothrombin time was significantly less on days 2 and 4 with perindopril and day 4 with CsA. Liver histological changes were minimal in all groups at 30 min ischaemia, but were significantly less severe in the perindopril group. There was a significant decrease in the weight of the regenerated liver at day 23 with perindopril and a significantly lower drop in weight on day 1 and the rate of gain was significantly greater. Perindopril (4 mg/kg) and CsA (15 mg/kg) significantly alter liver function tests, liver histology and bodyweight following an ischaemia-reperfusion injury associated with liver resection. These findings could limit ischaemia-reperfusion injury for major liver resections in the clinical setting.", 
    "592": "The tetrapeptide N-Acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) was first isolated from bone marrow extracts and shown to be involved in the negative control of hematopoiesis by preventing the recruitment of primitive stem cells into S-phase. In vitro studies on AcSDKP catabolism in human plasma revealed that AcSDKP was cleaved by plasmatic angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE). The evaluation of the respective involvement of the two active sites of ACE in AcSDKP degradation in vitro revealed that the N-active site was preferentially involved in this catabolism. Moreover, an in vivo study on healthy volunteers of the catalytic efficiency of ACE towards AcSDKP after administration of Captopril demonstrated that AcSDKP was a physiological substrate of ACE. AcSDKP might represent the first natural specific substrate of the N-active site of the enzyme. These results pose the question of a potential role of ACE in the control of hematopoiesis as well as possible applications of ACE inhibitors to cope with dysfunctions in which AcSDKP might exert physiological control.", 
    "593": "The use of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, specially in children, has been empirical. This is because the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of captopril has not been clearly defined. It is not usually feasible to obtain the serial kinetic-dynamic data necessary to study this relationship in infants. The piglet was therefore investigated as an animal model in which to study the relationship between the kinetics and dynamics of captopril. The standard pharmacokinetic parameters for captopril in healthy anaesthetized piglets were found to be within the range reported for humans. ClTB was estimated to be 1.42 +/- 0.33 L h-1 kg(-1); t1/2 was 0.44 +/- 0.08 h; Vdss was calculated to be 0.64 +/- 0.13 L kg(-1); t1/2 and AUC0-infinity was estimated to be 145 +/- 27 ng h mL(-1). The observed haemodynamic response was qualitatively similar to that in humans. Aortic pressure was reduced by 42 +/- 18%; heart rate was reduced by 21 +/- 11%. A parametric pharmacokinetic (two-compartment)-pharmacodynamic (linear) model has been established to describe plasma captopril concentration and aortic pressure relationship. Based on the observed results, the piglet was considered to be a viable model for our purpose.",

    "595": "Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that has been considered to have only one function which is to cleave angiotensinogen between the 10th and 11th amino acids to form angiotensin-1. This is then converted to angiotensin-II, a potent vasoconstrictor, antinatriuretic and antidiuretic by angiotensin-converting enzyme. We have investigated the action of renin to stimulate prostaglandin production by decidual cells and in so doing have generated data that challenge the prevailing dogma. Renin stimulates decidual prostaglandin production in a concentration-related fashion that is unaffected by saralasin treatment. This stimulatory action of renin is enhanced rather than reduced by arachidonic acid treatment but abolished by treatment with cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Renin caused a more rapid recovery of decidual prostaglandin biosynthesis from acetylsalicylic acid treatment than did control media. Moreover, renin treatment of both decidual and amnion cells induced increased levels of PGHS-2 within 2 h. Collectively, these results indicate that renin can act directly, separately from the generation of angiotensin-I and II. In this case renin can induce PGHS expression.", 
    "596": "This study approaches the question of whether angiotensin II (AngII) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) are important mediators for mesangial heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) production. This might explain the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors observed in several kidney diseases independent from their hemodynamic effects. Metabolic-labeling studies revealed that AngII induced a decrease of HSPG synthesis with decreases in N-sulfation of the glycosaminoglycan side chains. ELISA measurements with a heparan sulfate (HS)-specific monoclonal antibody confirmed that AngII decreased HS production. AngII increased TGF-beta production in a dose-dependent fashion. Specific mRNA for the large basement membrane HSPG (perlecan) decreased, whereas mRNA for TGF-beta increased after incubation with AngII. Blockade of the Subtype 1 Ang-II receptor (ATR1) reversed both the effects of AngII on HSPG and TGF-beta production. Coincubation of the mesangial cells with neutralizing antibodies against TGF-beta significantly reduced the production of HS as compared with control and AngII. These results indicate that the decrease in HS synthesis induced by AngII is not mediated by an increase in TGF-beta, but on the contrary, the increase in TGF-beta partially counteracts the inhibition of HS production by AngII. Considering the important role of HSPG in maintaining the glomerular charge barrier, cell proliferation, and matrix interaction, downregulation of the production of this molecule by increased local AngII concentrations could have important consequences, such as albuminuria and matrix expansion.",

Complications of extreme hypertension may be very serious, even life threatening, with the potential for life-long sequelae. Of greatest significance is damage to the central nervous system. Treatment of hypertensive emergencies should be directed toward the lowering of blood pressure enough to reduce toxicity, but not at a rate likely to cause hypoperfusion of vital organs. This blood pressure reduction should, in general, be carefully controlled in an intensive care unit, with attention to central nervous system, cardiac, and renal function. Intravenous agents are preferable under these circumstances, due to greater ease in modulating blood pressure. In the absence of specific contraindications, a continuous infusion of nicardipine or sodium nitroprusside is preferable. Intravenous labetalol by bolus injection, followed by continuous infusion, also may be used. Oral agents should be reserved for circumstances in which symptoms of end-organ toxicity are mild or absent. Since general pediatricians have limited experience with the treatment of hypertensive emergencies, consultation with physicians experienced in treating hypertensive emergencies is suggested when possible.",

Additionally, data are available to support the use of pharmacologic interventions in nonhypertensive patients with diabetes and proteinuria. Drug therapies that have produced reductions in proteinuria in this patient population include angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors and nondihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonists.

    "604": "To establish current national clinical practice in the care of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a questionnaire survey of 50 consultant physicians currently working in the Republic of Ireland was carried out. There were 45 (90%) respondents. 32/45 (71%) give thrombolysis in CCU only; 13/45 (29%) give thrombolysis in casualty also. Streptokinase (Stk) is the first choice thrombolytic agent for the majority. 14/45 (31%) use tPA for anterior AMI in patients under 60 years. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are given by 34/45 (76%) to patients with evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. ACE inhibitors are neither used routinely nor are they prescribed in the first three days after the AMI by the majority of the physicians surveyed. Serum magnesium is checked routinely by 5/45 (11%) and intravenous magnesium is given routinely by 5/45 (11%). The percentage of AMI patients considered for angiography varied from 10-50%. Despite reports from randomised, controlled trials showing reduced mortality in patients given tPA (versus Stk), routine early ACE inhibition and intravenous magnesium post-AMI, most clinicians in Ireland use streptokinase, selective late ACE inhibition and no magnesium. The reasons for the dichotomy between the favourable results of randomised clinical trials and routine practice are speculative.",

    "609": "1. The role of the metalloendopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP 24.15) in peptide metabolism in vivo is unknown, in part reflecting the lack of a stable enzyme inhibitor. The most commonly used inhibitor, N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (cFP-AAY-pAB, Ki = 16 nM), although selective in vitro, is rapidly degraded in the circulation to cFP-Ala-Ala, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. This metabolite is thought to be generated by neutral endopeptidase (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11), as the Ala-Tyr bond of cFP-AAY-pAB is cleaved by NEP in vitro. In the present study, we have examined the role of NEP in the metabolism of cFP-AAY-pAB in vivo, and have tested a series of inhibitor analogues, substituted at the second alanine, for both potency and stability relative to the parent compound. 2. Analogues were screened for inhibition of fluorescent substrate cleavage by recombinant rat testes EP 24.15. D-Ala or Asp substitution abolished inhibitory activity, while Val-, Ser- and Leu-substituted analogues retained activity, albeit at a reduced potency. A relative potency order of Ala (1) > Val (0.3) > Ser (0.16) > Leu (0.06) was observed. Resistance to cleavage by NEP was assessed by incubation of the analogues with rabbit kidney membranes. The parent compound was readily degraded, but the analogues were twice (Ser) and greater than 10 fold (Leu and Val) more resistant to cleavage. 3. Metabolism of cFP-AAY-pAB and the Val-substituted analogue was also examined in conscious rabbits. A bolus injection of cFP-AAY-pAB (5 mg kg-1, i.v.) significantly reduced the blood pressure response to angiotensin I, indicating ACE inhibition. Pretreatment with NEP inhibitors, SCH 39370 or phosphoramidon, slowed the loss of cFP-AAY-pAB from the plasma, but did not prevent inhibition of ACE. Injection of 1 mg kg-1 inhibitor resulted in plasma concentrations at 10 s of 23.5 microM (cFP-AAY-pAB) and 18.0 microM (cFP-AVY-pAB), which fell 100 fold over 5 min. Co-injection of 125I-labelled inhibitor revealed that 80-85% of the radioactivity had disappeared from the circulation within 5 min, and h.p.l.c. analysis demonstrated that only 25-30% of the radiolabel remained as intact inhibitor at this time. Both analogues were cleared from the circulation at the same rate, and both inhibitors blunted the pressor response to angiotensin I, indicative of ACE inhibition. 4. These results suggest that both NEP and other clearance/degradation mechanisms severely limit the usefulness of peptide-based inhibitors such as cFP-AAY-pAB. To examine further EP 24.15 function in vivo, more stable inhibitors, preferably non-peptide, must be developed, for which these peptide-based inhibitors may serve as useful molecular templates.", 
    "610": "Renin-like activity (RLA), angiotensin I converting enzyme-like (ACELA), and kallikrein-like activity (KLA), activities of the key enzymes of renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems, were sought in the kidney of the African lungfish Protopterus annectens during the aquatic phase. RLA, examined by RIA (using porcine angiotensinogen as substrate), was 0.38 +/- 0.05 ng angiotensin I/mg protein/hr. ACELA and KLA were investigated in assays spectrophotometrically. ACELA, measured at 37 and at 20 degrees , was, respectively, 1.55 +/- 0.55 and 0.61 +/- 0.23 nmol hippurate/min/mg protein. KLA was 7.34 +/- 0.93 mU/mg protein in the crude kidney extract and 31.05 +/- 7.50 mU/mg protein after electrophoretic purification. Renal kininogenase activity was inhibited by 100% by D-Phe-Phe-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (10 microM), 98% by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 nM), and 91% by aprotinin (1000 kIU). The apparent molecular weight of the renal kininogenase on SDS-PAGE was 27,000 Da. Both the renal enzyme and the purified glandular kallikrein, used as a control, have the same mobility on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoreactivities toward angiotensin II and bradykinin were localized by double immunostaining in the same cells of the proximal tubules.

    "611": "1. Over the last 40 years a range of therapeutic strategies has been introduced for the long term treatment of hypertension. 2. Although safe effective agents are available a significant number of patients are unable or unwilling to take these drugs as long term treatment. 3. Both insufficient efficacy and adverse effects justify the search for new antihypertensive strategies. 4. Recent developments include orally active angiotensin (AT1) receptor antagonists (ARA) which appear to offer the benefits of prevention of angiotensin II effects without the adverse effects of bradykinin potentiation, such as cough, which limit the usefulness of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 5. Imidazoline receptor agonists offer the potential of centrally active antihypertensives without the adverse effects of sedation and dry mouth. Further clinical experience is necessary to confirm whether the clinical efficacy and good tolerability are confirmed with long term use. 6. Both ARA and imidazoline preferring substances offer the bonus of a desirable haemodynamic profile in patients with heart failure and may open new therapeutic avenues in the management of cardiac failure.", 
    "612": "Calcium channel blockers can block calcium signals that trigger cell differentiation and apoptosis, which are important mechanisms of cancer growth regulation. To ascertain whether calcium channel blocker use was associated with an increased risk of cancer, 750 hypertensive persons age > or = 71 years, with no history of cancer at baseline, were followed from 1988 through 1992. The patients were using either beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers (verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem; mainly of the short-acting variety). Compared to beta-blockers (n = 424, 28 events), after adjusting for age, gender, race, smoking, body mass index, and number of hospital admissions not related with cancer, the relative risks of cancer (95% confidence interval) for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 124, 6 events) and calcium channel blockers (n = 202, 27 events) were 0.73 (0.30 to 1.78) and 2.02 (1.16 to 3.54), respectively. These findings indicate that calcium channel blocker therapy might increase the risk of cancer. New data are needed in patients using modern calcium channel blocker agents with more gradual absorption. This report should encourage further study of cancer outcomes in elderly patients who are vulnerable to cancer and who are receiving calcium channel blockers.", 
    "613": "Fructose feeding induces a moderate increase in blood pressure (BP) levels in normal rats, which is associated with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Increased vascular resistances in skeletal muscle have been proposed to contribute to BP elevation and insulin resistance in this animal model. To further explore the mechanisms underlying the fructose-induced hypertension in rats, the effects of quinapril and diltiazem on BP, renal function, plasma levels of glucose, insulin, and triglycerides, and insulin resistance were studied. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed for 4 weeks with diets containing 60% fructose or 60% starch and received quinapril or diltiazem in the drinking water. Fructose-fed rats showed higher BP and plasma levels of insulin and triglycerides when compared to controls. Treatments with quinapril or diltiazem prevented BP elevation and reduced elevated plasma insulin levels in fructose-fed rats. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were higher (P < .05) in fructose-fed rats than in controls at 15, 30, and 60 min after oral glucose load. Treatments with either quinapril or diltiazem prevented the exaggerated plasma insulin and glucose levels in response to oral glucose load in fructose-fed rats. In summary, both quinapril and diltiazem were able to prevent BP elevation levels in the fructose-fed rat, and reduced the exaggerated response to an oral glucose tolerance test in these animals.", 
    "614": "The SMART study (Self-Measurement for the Assessment of the Response to Trandolapril) was performed in general practice and enrolled 1710 patients in order to assess on a large scale the feasibility and informative value of self-measurement of blood pressure at home (SMBP), define home blood pressure (BP) levels in comparison to office readings, and determine the number of home measurements necessary to provide an accurate and precise BP value. After a 2-week washout period, patients with office diastolic blood pressure within the range 95 to 119 mm Hg received 2 mg trandolapril once daily in the morning for 4 weeks. Four days of SMBP were performed both at the end of the washout period and the end of the treatment period, with an automatic printer-equipped oscillometric device (A&D UA751). The first day values were not analyzed. Thus, the maximum number of BP measurements obtained per patient and per period was 18. Four hundred and twenty-four patients (25%) did not perform any measurements. One thousand one hundred and nine patients (65%) performed at least 4 measurements. Among them, 619 (36%) correctly performed all 18 measurements. A preference for digits 0 and 5 was detected in physicians' measurements (three consecutive values, during a single office visit). This digit preference was not found with the semiautomatic device. When the number of measurements selected for analysis was increased from 1 to 18, in the 604 patients who provided all recordings and fullfilled all protocol criteria, the standard deviation of the mean BP of the cohort was reduced by 17% for SBP and by 23% for DBP. Eighty-five percent of this reduction was already achieved by six home measurements taken at random. BP was significantly lower at home than at the office by 13 +/- 15 mm Hg for systolic BP (SBP), and 8 +/- 10 mm Hg for diastolic BP (DBP). This difference was independent of age, more marked in women (P < .001 for SBP and P < .05 for DBP), and had a Gaussian distribution. Under treatment, office SBP/DBP decreased from 166.4 +/- 14.8/101.4 +/- 5.7 mm Hg to 144.7 +/- 14.2/86.1 +/- 8.3 mm Hg, while SMBP decreased from 153.2 +/- 17.8/93.8 +/- 10.1 mm Hg to 139.4 +/- 16.4/85.1 +/- 9.5 mm Hg (all P < .0001). A major aim in research studies and individual care is to reduce BP measurements variability. This study demonstrates the ability to evaluate baseline SMBP level in two-thirds of patients previously unfamiliar with the method, the ability to evaluate treatment effect in about one-half of the patients, the improvement in the measurement precision obtained with the repetition of measures (at least six home measurements), and the absence of bias of SMBP as compared to office measurements.", 
    "615": "Medications given once daily may increase compliance for treatment of hypertension, if the drugs have a prolonged duration of action. The time-effect profiles for antihypertensive drugs may not depend entirely on pharmacokinetic measurements (plasma levels). Thus, trough/peak effects on blood pressure should be measured. It has been suggested that trough/peak ratios be greater than 50% for optimal 24-h control of pressure. Because very little information is available for many angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists concerning their trough/peak ratios and awaiting prospective comparative trials with adequate methodology, we have analyzed the duration of action of blood pressure lowering during long-term therapy with commercially available ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists in published studies that used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Published studies were searched in scientific databases using relevant key words. Twenty-four ACE inhibitor and 34 calcium antagonist studies with comparable methodologies were selected. The mean trough/ peak ratios were computed after reconstruction of the curve of the magnitude of blood pressure changes against time. The results showed that once daily administration of ACE inhibitors produced on average ratios higher than 50% with fosinopril (64%), ramipril (50% to 63%), and trandolapril (50% to 100%). Other studied ACE inhibitors produced ratios on average equal to [enalapril (40% to 64%), cilazapril (10% to 80%), lisinopril (30% to 70%)] or significantly lower than 50% [captopril (25%), benazepril (40%), perindopril (35%), quinapril (10% to 40%), and moexipril (0% to 9%)]. As for once daily calcium antagonists, amlodipine (50% to 100%), lacidipine (40% to 100%), nifedipine Coat-Core (50% to 69%), nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) (60% to 94%), as well as various \"slow release\" formulations of diltiazem (20% to 80%) and verapamil (45% to 100%) had on average ratios higher than 50% whereas felodipine ER (30% to 45%), various slow release formulations of isradipine (10% to 80%), and nitrendipine (10% to 80%) had ratios lower than 50%. Although this retrospective literature analysis may have some theoretical limitations, it suggests that not all once daily ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists cause trough/peak ratio superior to 50%. This may have important clinical implications.", 
    "616": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, is used in the treatment of heart failure after myocardial infarction. This study evaluated whether different behavioral parameters of anxiety are affected by captopril therapy after myocardial infarction in rats. Myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery and captopril therapy was started after 3 weeks. After 2 weeks of captopril therapy, anxiety-related behaviors were successively measured in four different tests: open field, elevated plus maze, home cage emergence, and open field escape. Myocardial infarction and captopril therapy affected behavior in the home cage emergence test and open field escape test. On the basis of the data from the open field escape test, captopril therapy appeared to decrease anxiety in infarcted rats and increase anxiety in sham rats. Because myocardial infarction and captopril therapy did not affect anxiety-related behaviors in the open field and elevated plus maze tests, it is assumed that these interventions affect anxiety-related behaviors depending on the type of test. This was partially supported by correlation analysis, which suggested that the behavior of the rats in the different tests of anxiety may reflect different anxiety-related traits.", 
    "617": "The 4 major classes of antihypertensive drugs are diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists. The diuretics have recently regained prominence, largely due to the results of recent controlled trials. These trials in elderly patients demonstrated that low-dose diuretics were effective not only in preventing stroke but also in greatly reducing coronary-related events. Diuretics also decrease left ventricular mass more than the other major drug classes. In addition, they are the most effective drugs for use in combination therapy. By contrast, the safety of calcium antagonists has recently been questioned because of report of increased coronary morbidity and mortality. However, these adverse events may be restricted to the short-acting preparations, especially nifedipine, which causes cardiac stimulation. ACE inhibitors, like beta-blockers, are not only effective in reducing blood pressure, particularly when combined with a diuretic, but also improve angina and decrease postinfarction mortality. They also benefit congestive heart failure, stabilise or improve renal function in hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy and reduce albuminuria. Beta-Blockers are especially effective in reducing sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease, particularly in postinfarction patients. Final proof of the relative effectiveness of these drugs in preventing morbidity and mortality must await the outcome of large comparative trials currently under way. A recent national survey in the US found that more than 75% of hypertensive patients did not have their hypertension completely controlled. Possible reasons for this disturbing statistic are discussed along with suggestions for improvement.", 
    "618": "We wished to determine whether enhanced bioavailability of bradykinin (BK) and vasodilatory prostaglandins contribute to renovascular and sodium-handling effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition after myocardial infarction (MI). We studied rats after coronary artery ligation treated for 3 weeks with captopril or losartan (2 g/L drinking water for each agent). Hemodynamic and renal function studies were performed in conscious rats before and after sequential infusion BK inhibitor (BKI, 0.02 ng/kg/min) and indomethacin (1 mg/kg). Myocardial infarction increased filtration fraction (FF) 20% (p < .004) but did not change glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine flow (UF), renal blood flow (RBF), renal vascular resistance (RVR), urine sodium (UNa), or fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). Captopril decreased (p < 0.001) mean arterial pressure (MAP) 25%, UF 61%, RVR 65%, and FENa 75% and increased (p < 0.05) GFR 22%, and RBF 34%. Losartan decreased (p < 0.05) MAP 27%, UF 52%, RVR 21%, and FENa 44%. In captopril-treated MI rats, BKI decreased (p < 0.05) GFR 22% and RBF 25% and increased (p < 0.05) RVR 32%, UNa 43%, and FENa 28%, whereas indomethacin decreased (p < 0.05) GFR 24% and increased (p < 0.05) UNa 86% and FENa 112%. In losartan-treated MI rats, BKI increased (p < 0.05) UNa 42% and FENa 60%, whereas indomethacin increased (p < 0.05) UNa 79% and FENa 85%. Activation of the BK and prostaglandin systems may play an important role in regulating renal function during chronic ACE inhibition, primarily by enhancing the renal vasodilatory effects of angiotensin II (AII) blockade.", 
    "619": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) prevents the increase in blood pressure (BP) induced by chronic administration of NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in rats. In the present study, we showed how a converting enzyme inhibitor can prevent the end-stage tissue damage due to chronic nitric oxide (NO) synthase blockade and thus improve the survival rate. Three experiments were performed. In the first, rats (n = 10) were given L-NAME (50 mg/kg) and 10 other rats were given L-NAME plus quinapril (10 mg/kg) starting 1 month after L-NAME administration. Ten untreated rats were used as controls. Rats were killed after 2 months, and the RAS, renal function, and renal morphology were analyzed. In the second experiment, a similar protocol was used, and function and morphological damage in renal slices and cervical medullary tissue were assessed after 4 months of L-NAME and 3 months of quinapril + L-NAME. In the third experiment, a similar protocol was used, but to establish survival curves, the animals were not killed. L-NAME significantly increased BP without causing any significnat changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) at 2 months. The aortic wall cyclic GMP content was significantly decreased, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was increased by L-NAME. Quinapril significantly reversed the high BP induced by L-NAME without changing the decrease in the aortic wall cyclic GMP. Two-month L-NAME treatment decreased renal function and damaged renal tissue. Quinapril prevented both proteinuria and morphological damage. Four-month L-NAME treatment induced renal end-stage damage and infarctions of the cervical medulla. Quinapril prevented this end-stage damage in the kidney and cervical medulla. Quinapril therefore prevented the increased mortality due to L-NAME. Hence, inhibition of ACE, despite its lack of effect on arterial wall cyclic GMP, does reverse the hypertension and prevent end-stage vascular damage induced by chronic L-NAME in target organs.", 
    "620": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto control rats (WKY) were treated for 14 weeks with a novel calcium channel blocker, mibefradil (Ro40-5967), or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril. Blood pressure was significantly reduced by treatment in SHRs from > 200 mm Hg to 155 +/- 2 mm Hg by mibefradil and to 138 +/- 1 mm Hg by cilazapril (p < 0.01). Cardiac hypertrophy was significantly reduced by treatment but to a greater degree with cilazapril than with mibefradil. Conduit and large arteries also had significant regression of hypertrophy. Small arteries (luminal diameter, 200-300 microns) of the coronary, renal, mesenteric, and femoral circulations exhibited significant hypertrophy and remodeling in SHRs in comparison to WKYs. Cilazapril treatment resulted in increased lumen, reduced media thickness, and media-to-lumen ratio in all four vascular beds. Mibefradil treatment induced regression of luminal diameter to a significant degree only in the mesenteric and femoral small arteries but decreased media thickness and media to lumen diameter in all four vascular beds. The greater extent of regression of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy and remodeling with cilazapril than with mibefradil may relate to the degree of blood pressure reduction, which, with the doses used, was larger with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor than with the calcium channel blocker. In WKY rats, treatment had no effect except with cilazapril on lumen diameter of small arteries and with mibefradil on heart weight, both of which increased. These results demonstrate the blood-pressure dependence of regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy and remodeling and the possibility of achieving \"reverse remodeling\" of large and small arteries with converting enzyme inhibition or calcium channel blockade in SHRs, as well as the near absence of effects of these agents on cardiovascular characteristics in WKYs.", 
    "621": "We wished to determine in asymptomatic hypertensive patients with > or = 70% stenosis of an internal carotid artery the change in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) produced by ramipril and enalapril and to evaluate the influence of age on drug-induced changes in rCBF. In a prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled investigation, using the 133Xenon inhalation technique, we assessed baseline rCBF in 15 patients (9 men and 6 women aged 60-79 years) after a 24-h antihypertensive drug-free period. All patients then received a single 5-mg oral dose of ramipril, enalapril, or placebo. rCBF was reassessed 2 h postdose. There was no significant change in the median rCBF in any of the three treatment groups. Neither did we observe any lateralization of BF to any specific cerebral region in any of the three groups. There were no observed or patient-reported adverse events (AE). Single 5-mg oral doses of either ramipril or enalapril did not decrease CBF significantly in asymptomatic hypertensive patients with > or = 70% stenosis of an internal carotid artery and are probably safe starting doses in such patients. In addition, this effect was not modified by age.", 
    "622": "Therapeutic response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was reported to be better related to tissular than to circulating levels of ACE inhibition, especially during chronic therapy. We studied the relations between plasma concentrations of angiotensin I (AI), plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII), and aldosterone (by radioimmunoassay, RIA) and levels of serum and tissue ACE activities during acute and chronic quinapril administration in rats. Forty-eight male Wistar rats received quinapril by gavage for either 1 day (n = 24) or 15 days (n = 24) at different doses (control, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg/day; 6 rats at each dose). Plasma hormonal parameters, serum, and tissue (lung, heart, and aorta) ACE activities were measured 3 h after the last gavage. Significant dose-dependent inhibitions of serum and lung ACE during acute and chronic treatments were observed (p < 0.05). Degrees of serum and heart ACE inhibition (at 0.1 mg/kg/day) were significantly lower with chronic than with acute treatment (p < 0.05). Degree of inhibition in lung, which represents the main source of total ACE, was similar during acute and chronic treatments. Among plasma hormonal parameters, plasma AI was correlated to PRA and showed the best correlation with ACE inhibition. After logarithmic transformation, log AI was significantly correlated to ACE activity in lung during chronic treatment (r = -0.85, p < 0.05). This parameter may provide a useful index for ACE inhibitor dosage adjustment during chronic therapy.", 
    "623": "The new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril was compared with the ACE inhibitor enalapril in a multicenter (n = 11), multinational (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden), double-blind, randomized, parallel-group 24-week study in 195 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension [supine diastolic blood pressure, (SDBP) > or = 95 to < or = 110 mm Hg]. After discontinuing all previous antihypertensive medication, patients were entered into a placebo lead-in period of 4-6 weeks, followed by 24 weeks of randomized treatment with the active compounds administered with a double-dummy technique. The dose of fosinopril was 20 mg, which could be increased to 40 mg after 8 weeks (average 25.6 mg); that of enalapril was 10 mg, which could be increased to 20 mg after 8 weeks (average 12.9 mg). Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg could be added after 16 weeks and was administered to 27% of the patients in the fosinopril group and to 30% in the enalapril group. All drugs were administered once daily. Supine systolic BP (SSBP) decreased from 157 to 143 mm Hg in the fosinopril group (p < 0.01), and from 159 to 147 mm Hg in the enalapril group (p < 0.01). SSDP decreased from 100 to 89 mm Hg in the fosinopril group (p < 0.01) and from 100 to 92 mm Hg in the enalapril group (p < 0.01). Throughout the study period, fosinopril reduced SSBP and SDBP numerically more than did enalapril, by 0-3 mm Hg. Adverse events (AE) caused withdrawal of study medication in 8 patients in the fosinopril group and in 14 patients in the enalapril group (NS). The number of reported AE was not statistically different in the two groups. Inhibition of the ACE was assessed in a subgroup of patients (n = 26, 13 in each group). Fosinopril caused a greater inhibition of ACE at the doses used in the present study, which was statistically significant. Both fosinopril and enalapril caused statistically significant reductions in BP of a similar magnitude, and both agents were well tolerated. However, fosinopril was consistently numerically slightly more effective than enalapril in reducing BP. There were fewer withdrawals due to AE (NS) in the fosinopril group, and the overall recorded AE were fewer in the fosinopril group (NS).", 
    "624": "Losartan is an orally active angiotensin II antangonist that selectively blocks effects mediated by the stimulation of the AT1 subtype of the angiotensin II receptor. This agent, at doses of 50-150mg/day, is as effective at lowering blood pressure as chronic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Losartan is generally well tolerated and has an incidence of adverse effects very similar, in double-blind controlled trials, to that of placebo. It does not cause coughing, the most common side-effect of the ACE inhibitors, most probably because angiotensin II antagonism has no impact on ACE, an enzyme known to process bradykinin and other cough-inducing peptides. Losartan is a promising antihypertensive agent with the potential to become a first-line option for the treatment of patients with high blood pressure.", 
    "625": "This double-blind study was conducted to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three dose levels of moexipril in comparison to placebo as add-on therapy to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Two hundred patients who did not respond adequately to a 4-week monotherapy with HCTZ-sitting diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mm Hg- entered the 8-week double-blind period. Patients were randomized to once daily placebo or moexipril 3.75, 7.5 or 15 mg as add-on therapy to open-label HCTZ 25 mg. At biweekly visits, blood pressure and heart rate measurements were obtained and the occurrence of adverse experiences was documented. At the 8-week endpoint, adjusted mean reductions from baseline were significantly (p = 0.003) greater in patients receiving moexipril 3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg compared to placebo (-8.4, -8.8 and -8.9 vs. -4.6 mm Hg). No significant differences between the three dose levels of moexipril could be observed. Moexipril was generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events for moexipril and placebo were headache, flu syndrome and dizziness (6, 7, 5 vs. 4, 0, 4%). The results indicate that the combination of moexipril and HCTZ is a clinically valuable combination in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "626": "In male Sprague Dawley rats with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension induced by aortic constriction (AC) and subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) by occlusion of the left coronary artery the effects of ACE inhibition with ramipril (RA 1 mg/kg/day via the drinking water during 6 weeks) on survival as well as cardiac function and metabolism were investigated. Respective groups (sham AC; AC; AC + sham MI; normotensive animals with sham MI; MI; MI + RA) served as comparisons. Following MI hypertensive rats with AC and LVH revealed an increased postoperative mortality (68%) when compared to normotensives without AC (28%). ACE inhibition with ramipril significantly reduced mortality in hypertensive rats by 26%. Untreated hypertensive animals with LVH clearly showed reduced MI size (6.2 +/- 2.3%) in comparison with untreated normotensive animals and MI (31.0 +/- 3.3%). In hypertensive rats with MI which died during the study a significant increase in infarct size was found compared to those which survived MI. In normotensive animals ramipril reduced infarct size by 50%. Due to the quite small infarct size observed in hypertensive rats, ACE inhibition did not further reduce MI in these animals. LVH as well as hydroxyproline/proline ratio was diminished by ACE inhibitor treatment. In the isolated hearts of ramipril treated rats contractility was improved when compared to the respective untreated groups with MI. In the coronary effluent of isolated hearts from rats with AC and MI lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities as well as lactate levels were increased. Ramipril treatment starting one week before MI normalized these parameters and in addition increased prostacyclin output. Hearts with MI from treated normotensive animals contained increased energy rich phosphates when compared to hearts from untreated rats with MI.", 
    "627": "Hypertensive rats with LVH undergoing MI experience increased postoperative mortality probably due to a reduced tolerance to myocardial ischemia and occurrence of arrhythmias. In these animals ACE inhibition with ramipril increased survival. Both, increased survival in hypertensive and reduction in infarct size in normotensive rats by ACE inhibition with ramipril was accompanied by an improved myocardial metabolism.", 
    "628": "We have previously demonstrated that captopril ameliorates glucose intolerance by partially preventing the reduction in postprandial skeletal muscle blood flow. The present study was designed to clarify the mechanism by which ACE inhibitors affect glucose metabolism in fructose (FRU)-fed Wistar rats with hypertension, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Eight-week-old male rats (n = 51) were divided into six groups. Controls were given a normal chow, while fructose-rich (55%) chow was administered to the remainder for eight weeks. The different groups were administered alacepril (ALA, 30 mg/kg/day) with or without a continuous infusion of Hoe 140, a kinin B2 receptor antagonist (150 micrograms/kg/day), Hoe 140 alone or TCV-116 (1 mg/kg/day), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, alone. After measuring the body weight and systolic blood pressure (BP), steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) levels were determined. FRU significantly increased BP from 141 mmHg in controls to 156 mmHg. ALA with or without Hoe 140 decreased BP to 124 mmHg or 117 mmHg, respectively, but Hoe 140 alone did not affect BP. TCV-116 also decreased BP to 116 mmHg. The SSPG levels increased from 7.58 mM in controls to 8.98 mM in FRU-fed rats. This was lowered with both ALA and TCV-116. Hoe 140 alone, however, did not affect SSPG levels. Hoe 140 did not show any effects on ALA-induced improvement of SSPG. These results suggest that the improvement in glucose tolerance observed with ACE inhibitors is not due to the kinins, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists also improve insulin sensitivity.", 
    "629": "Blood pressure and heart rate were measured by telemetry in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) to investigate the contribution of angiotensin II to the reflex tachycardia resulting from exaggerated hypotension caused by a high dose of a calcium channel blocker. Pre-treatment with TCV-116, an angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist, or enalapril partially attenuated the reflex tachycardia induced by manidipine, but TCV-116 had almost no effect on the sinus tachycardia induced by isoproterenol. The suppressive effects of TCV-116 against the reflex tachycardia tended to be more obvious in WKY than in SHR, though the difference was not statistically significant. Concurrent administration of propranolol almost completely inhibited both the reflex tachycardia and the sinus tachycardia in SHR and WKY, indicating that the sympathetic nervous system contributes to both types of tachycardia. We demonstrated that angiotensin II may be involved in the reflex tachycardia induced by calcium channel blockers probably via activation of some component of the sympathetic nervous system other than postsynaptic factors at the sinus node.", 
    "630": "Aqueous extracts of 27 basidiomycetes were investigated for their ability to inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The extracts of 5 fungi inhibited both, ACE and NEP activity, another 18 extracts showed inhibition of the NEP activity whereas only 1 basidiomycete inhibited the ACE activity exclusively. The IC50 values for the ACE inhibition are rather high (between 200 and 1500 micrograms/ml) in comparison to the IC50 of the NEP inhibition (between 40 and 2000 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that the basidiomycetes investigated seem to have a higher potential for the inhibition of the activity of NEP than of ACE. In general, basidiomycetes are a new source for inhibitors of metalloendopeptidases. Resulting from the isolation and characterization of these compounds new leading structures are expectable.", 
    "631": "The increasing role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in cardiovascular disease makes it important for the practising clinician to be aware of the specific benefits afforded by these agents. This article covers the use of ACE inhibitors in hypertension, chronic heart failure, post myocardial infarction, diabetic nephropathy and atherosclerosis, with specific reference to clinical trial data and proposed mechanisms of effect.", 
    "632": "Heart failure is still not well treated and the published information concerning treatment options has been slow in filtering through to general practitioners. Once a diagnosis of heart failure is made, treatment should begin with an angiotensin converting inhibitor. The dose should be increased relatively quickly. Diuretics and digoxin can be added if there is oedema. If this does not result in adequate improvement, other vasodilators or beta-blockers can be added. Other forms of therapy including antiarrhythmics, anticoagulants and surgery are discussed.", 
    "633": "The authors recently reported that renovascular hypertension (RVH) in rats is associated with enhanced responsiveness to the slow pressor effect of angiotensin II (AngII). It was concluded that the contribution of AngII to the development of hypertension could not be inferred solely from measurements of plasma peptide concentrations. This experiment was performed to test the corollary hypothesis that the antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in established RVH could be caused in part by inhibition of the slow pressor effect. After five control days of measurement of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and other variables, RVH rats were given the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in their drinking water. Half of these rats also received a continuous infusion of AngII, 4 ng/min i.v., an infusion rate previously shown to restore normal MAP in normal rats rendered hypotensive by chronic treatment with enalapril. Other RVH rats were given the potent vasodilator minoxidil in their drinking water, and half of these received AngII. Treatments lasted 7 days and were followed by 5 days without intervention. Enalapril significantly reduced MAP, but concurrent AngII infusion overcame this effect; MAP remained at control hypertensive levels. AngII did not affect the antihypertensive response to minoxidil. These results confirm that addition of relatively modest amounts of AngII to the circulation is able to maintain elevated blood pressure in RVH. Thus, inhibition of the slow pressor effect of AngII may partially explain the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in RVH.", 
    "634": "This study was designed to quantitate the influence of the neurohumoral activation associated with orthostatic stress on renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion and, furthermore, to determine the importance of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating these changes in renal function. Seven conscious dogs were studied while lying in the recumbent position and, subsequently, after standing in a supporting sling. Experiments were conducted under control conditions and after plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) concentration was fixed at control levels by chronic infusion of captopril (14 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and ANG II (0.5 +/- 0.02 ng.kg-1.min-1). During control experiments, 45 min of standing increased plasma renin activity twofold, whereas mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine concentration remained unchanged. During standing, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) fell to 88 +/- 2 and 77 +/- 3% of recumbent values, respectively, whereas filtration fraction (FF) increased 16 +/- 1%. Additionally, urinary (UNaV) and fractional sodium excretion (FENa) decreased to 27 +/- 6 and 30 +/- 7% of recumbent values, respectively. When plasma ANG II concentration was fixed at control levels during standing, there were no significant changes in GFR, whereas increments in FF and reductions in RPF, UNaV, and FENa were attenuated by 63, 40, 30, and 33%, respectively. These data suggest that, in conscious dogs, standing in a supporting sling causes reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems, eliciting reductions in GFR, RPF, and UNaV. Furthermore, ANG II contributes significantly to the effects of passive standing on renal hemodynamics and UNaV.", 
    "635": "To investigate the role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in the development of hypertension induced by reduced renal mass (RRM) and the gene expression of ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptors in the remnant renal tissue, four groups of rats were given 1% NaCl in water and subjected to RRM, RRM+ ramipril, RRM+ losartan, or sham surgery (control). Tail-cuff systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in RRM rats than in the other three groups. Northern blot showed that AT1 gene expression was significantly decreased in RRM, RRM + ramipril, or RRM + losartan vs. control. There was no significant difference among the three RRM groups. Renal transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) mRNA levels were increased threefold (P < 0.05) in RRM, RRM+ ramipril, and RRM+ losartan vs. control. There was no significant difference among the three RRM groups. We conclude that the development of RRM hypertension is ANG II dependent but not mediated by AT1 gene expression. RRM downregulates AT1 mRNA and upregulates TGF-beta 1 mRNA in the remnant renal tissue, regardless of blood pressure or plasma levels of ANG II, suggesting that these gene responses are triggered by an effect of local injury.", 
    "636": "Adrenal cytogenesis was investigated in response to 1) subcutaneous infusions of angiotensin (ANG) II (200 ng.kg-1.min-1); 2) high and low sodium intake; and 3) captopril treatment (10 mg.kg-1.day-1). Cell proliferation was assessed as uptake of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into nuclei. BrdUrd, infused continuously throughout 2 wk of treatment, was detected immunocytochemically. ANG II and sodium restriction caused hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa with two- to threefold increases in BrdUrd indexes. After captopril, the glomerulosa appeared atrophied with pyknotic nuclei, but the BrdUrd index was unchanged. Zonae intermedia and fasciculata were unaffected by any treatment. Zona reticularis epithelial cells proliferated in response to ANG II and sodium restriction but were unaffected by captopril. In the medulla, captopril increased BrdUrd uptake, whereas ANG II, but not low sodium, caused a decrease. In conclusion, 1) proliferation of the glomerulosa and reticularis cells is specifically controlled by ANG II, 2) captopril may cause glomerulosa cells to die, and 3) blood pressure may control proliferation of the medulla.", 
    "637": "Treatment of rabbits with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibiting drugs increases Na(+)-K+ pump current (Ip) of isolated cardiac myocytes when intracellular Na+ is at near-physiological levels. To examine if effects of ACE inhibitors are related to angiotensin metabolism, we measured Ip in myocytes isolated from rabbits treated with the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan. Ip was increased to levels similar to those after treatment with ACE inhibitors. Exposure of myocytes from captopril-treated rabbits to 10 nM angiotensin II (ANG II) for 45 min in vitro reduced Ip to levels similar to those of myocytes from untreated control rabbits. This rapid response to ANG II suggests that treatment with captopril had induced a functional change in preexisting pump units rather than synthesis of a new population of pumps. Consistent with this, we could not detect a change in Na(+)-K+ pump subunit mRNAs during treatment with captopril. The decrease in Ip of myocytes from captopril-treated rabbits induced by ANG II in vitro was blocked by pertussis toxin, bisindolylmaleimide I, and staurosporine. Exposure of myocytes to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced a decrease in Ip similar to that induced by ANG II. Thus ACE inhibitors regulate the Na(+)-K+ pump in myocytes via an effect on angiotensin metabolism. The regulatory mechanism appears to include the AT1 receptor, a G protein, and protein kinase C.",

To achieve this goal, an ethnically diverse population of 480 men and women with essential hypertension and increased LV mass of screening echocardiography will be enrolled at clinical centers on 4 continents and studied by echocardiography at baseline and after 6 and 12 months' randomized therapy. Blinded readings of echocardiograms at a central laboratory will provide systematic information about treatment effects on LV structure, wall motion, and Doppler blood flow. The study power is at least 90% to test the primary hypotheses that enalapril will induce greater normalization of LV mass and diastolic filling than nifedipine. After the 1-year echocardiographic trial, the study population will be followed 3 more years to test the hypothesis that a reduction in LV mass, independent of blood pressure lowering, is associated with a reduction in the risk of morbid and fatal cardiovascular events.", 
    "644": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists are 2 classes of antihypertensive agents frequently used either as monotherapy or in combination. A 6-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in essential hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressures [BP] when seated, 95-115 mm Hg) to evaluate the efficacy, dose response, and safety profiles of enalapril combined with a new once-daily formulation of diltiazem. BP and heart rate were measured at 5 (peak) and 24 (trough) hours after dose to assess the efficacy and pharmacodynamic profile of the combination given once daily. There were 336 patients randomly assigned to either enalapril 5 mg plus 1 of 4 dose levels of diltiazem ER (60, 120, 180, or 240 mg), enalapril 5 mg alone, or placebo. Each combination dose level produced statistically significant reductions (p <0.05) in trough diastolic BP when seated, compared with placebo (-6.8, -8.3, -10.1, and -10.3 mm Hg for the diltiazem ER doses of 60, 120, 180, and 240 mg, respectively). The 3 highest combination dose levels resulted in statistically significant (p <0.05) decreases in trough diastolic BP when seated, compared with placebo. There was a significant (p <0.001) linear dose-response relation. A trough-to-peak ratio > or = 0.5 was shown for the 3 highest combination doses. Drug-related adverse events were seen in 8.9% to 19% of the combination patients, 14.3% of the enalapril patients, and 8.6% of the placebo patients.

    "645": "Beta-blockers reduce infarct size and improve survival after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Post-MI angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition also improves survival and may attenuate left ventricular (LV) dilatation. We evaluated the effect of early enalapril treatment on LV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) in patients on concomitant beta-blockade after MI. Intravenous enalaprilat or placebo was administered <24 hours after MI and was continued orally for 6 months. LV volumes were assessed by echocardiography 3 +/- 2 days, 1 and 6 months after MI. Change in LV diastolic volume during the first month was attenuated with enalapril (2.7 vs placebo 6.5 ml/m2 change; p < 0.05), and significantly lower LV diastolic and systolic volumes were observed with enalapril treatment compared with placebo at 1 month (enalapril 47.21 23.9 vs placebo 53.1/29.2 ml/m2; p < 0.05) and at 6 months (enalapril 47.9/24.8 vs placebo 53.8/29.6 ml/m2; p < 0.05). EF was also significantly higher 1 month after MI in these patients (enalapril 50.4% vs placebo 46.4%; p < 0.05). Our date demonstrate that early enalapril treatment attenuates LV volume expansion and maintains lower LV volumes and higher EF in patients receiving concurrent beta-blockade after MI.

We found 10 cases of depression that met DSM-III-R criteria (\"major depression\") and an additional 18 cases that had one or more symptoms consistent with depression (\"minor depression\"). Rates of major depression in users of beta-blockers and users of non-beta-blocker study drugs were 5.8 per 1000 person-years of exposure and 9.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively. None of the cases of major depression was propranolol associated. Rates of major or minor depression (combined) in users of beta-blockers and users of non-beta-blockers were 20.2 per 1000 person-years and 25.2 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The age- and sex-adjusted relative risk of major or minor depression associated with the use of beta-blockers compared to non-beta-blockers was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.3-1.9). The relative risk associated with propranolol compared to non-beta-blockers was also 0.8 (95% CI, 0.1-2.7).

    "651": "Evidence of in vivo oxidant-induced injury in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is largely indirect. Colon epithelial crypt cells (CEC) from paired specimens of histologically normal and inflamed bowel from IBD patients with active disease were examined for altered protein thiol redox status as an indicator of oxidative damage. When CEC preparations from 22 IBD patients were labeled with the reduced-thiol-specific probe [14C]-iodoacetamide (IAM), there was decreased labeling of a number of proteins indicating oxidation of thiol groups in CEC from inflamed mucosa compared to paired normal mucosa, especially the loss of thiol labeling of a 37-kD protein which was almost completely lost. The loss of reduced protein thiol status for the 37-kD band was paralleled by loss of epithelial cell glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.12) enzyme activity, an enzyme known to contain an essential reduced cysteine (Cys149) at the active site. The identity of the 37-kD protein as GADPH monomer was confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. To examine whether this type of in vivo injury could be attributed to biologically relevant oxidants produced by inflammatory cells, CEC prepared from normal mucosa were exposed to H2O2, OCl-, nitric oxide (NO), and a model chloramine molecule chloramine T (ChT) in vitro. Dose-dependent loss of IAM labeling and GAPDH enzyme activity was observed. The efficacy (IC50) against IAM labeling was OCl- > ChT > H2O2 > NO (52 +/- 3, 250 +/- 17, 420 +/- 12, 779 +/- 120 microM oxidant) and OCl- > ChT > NO > H2O2 (89 +/- 17, 256 +/- 11, 407 +/- 105, 457 +/- 75 microM oxidant), respectively, for GAPDH enzyme activity. This study provides direct evidence of in vivo oxidant injury in CEC from inflamed mucosa of IBD patients. Oxidation and inhibition of essential protein function by inflammatory cells is a potential mechanism of tissue injury that may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease and supports the exploration of compounds with antioxidant activity as new therapies for IBD.",

    "656": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now established drugs in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. However, their use in patients after a myocardial infarction has occurred remains controversial. The major clinical question regarding ACE inhibitors is whether they should be given to all patients immediately after thrombolysis or whether their use should be restricted to a particular subgroup. This question has now been addressed in several large-scale trials of mortality after myocardial infarction, and no important new information seems likely to emerge on the issue. Clinicians must therefore decide what their practice will be on the basis of data that are currently available. The authors of the recently published Gruppo italiano per lo Studio delta Sopravvlvenza nell' infarcto Miocardico (GISSI-3) and Fourth International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-4) mega-trials advocate a policy of widespread and early use of ACE inhibitors in all patients after myocardial infarction occurs. However, the small mortality benefit observed from use of ACE inhibitors in these studies lacks certainly and may prove difficult to reproduce in the general population of patients who have had an infarct outside the setting of a trial. Although patients were essentially not selected apart from the exclusion of those with marked hypotension, the low 6-month and 1-year mortality figures indicate \"selection\" compared with the typical population of patients who have had a myocardial infarction. Furthermore, a significant long-term mortality benefit was not observed with the short-term (4- to 6-week) use of ACE inhibitors in these trials. In contrast, in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE), Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE), and Trandopril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) trials, where evidence of impairment of ventricular function was used to select patients, both a marked and certain benefit regarding mortality was apparent from long-term prescription of these drugs. Importantly, the marked benefit observed in these selected patients may have been \"diluted out\" in the larger scale trials of unselected patients where the majority may have gained little and some may have been harmed by treatment or its withdrawal. In most of the large mortality trials the rationale for use of ACE inhibitors after myocardial infarction was stated to be their likely beneficial effect on \"remodeling\" of the heart after \"Infarct expansion.\" Because adverse remodeling occurs in only a proportion of patients after a heart attack, the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy might be predicted to be largely limited to this group, which would favor a selective policy. However, strong claims have been made that ACE inhibitors have other important actions, including prevention of myocardial infarction. If this is confirmed in a number of ongoing large-scale trials. then an even ore widespread use of these agents can be expected.",

Of these patients, 1749 (67%) were randomly assigned to receive oral trandolapril or placebo beginning on day 3 to 7 after the infarction. The follow-up period was 2 to 4 years. Trandolapril reduced all-cause mortality, with a relative risk reduction associated with trandolapril treatment of 0.78 (p = 0.0013). Benefit was seen within 1 month of treatment. Trandolapril also reduced cardiovascular death (relative risk 0.75, p = 0.001), sudden death (relative risk 0.76, p = 0.03), and progression to severe/ resistant heart failure (relative risk 0.71, p = 0.003). Recurrent myocardial infarction (fatal or nonfatal) was not significantly reduced (relative risk 0.86, p = 0.29). More than 80% of patients in both treatment groups reached the target dose of 4 mg trandolapril or placebo at the end of dose titration. Nearly half of the patients in both treatment groups discontinued taking study medication before death or trial closure. The need for open-label ACE inhibition was the reason for discontinuation for 48 and 75 patients in the trandolapril and placebo groups, respectively. In conclusion, long-term treatment with trandolapril in patients with reduced left ventricular function shortly after myocardial infarction significantly reduced mortality and morbidity. Most patients received the target dose of 4 mg trandolapril daily. The benefit observed is likely to reflect the benefit in clinical practice because the majority of eligible patients were randomized and the difference in patients leaving the trial to receive open-label ACE inhibition was moderate.", 
    "658": "Chronic heart failure is a disabling and lethal disorder with high incidence and prevalence in Western societies. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and heart transplantations diminish both mortality and morbidity, although both still remain high. Increased understanding of some of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the development of left ventricular dysfunction and the transition from asymptomatic systolic dysfunction to symptomatic heart failure has opened gates to new dimensions for the treatment of this disorder. The initial event in the pathophysiologic process is damage to the myocardium, most frequently a myocardial infarction. Almost simultaneously, activation of different neurohormonal systems occurs. The renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system are activated. Increased concentrations of hormones with counteractive activity have also been found, such as ANP and BNP. Interestingly, prolonged neurohormonal activation seems to occur only in patients with large infarcts or in patients with poor systolic function of the left ventricle. Moreover, available data from an echocardiographic study indicates that in patients with high concentrations of neurohormones in plasma a week after their infarction, left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle are highly likely to develop during long-term follow-up. Several studies have showed that ACE inhibitors are efficacious in chronic heart failure and among patients with reduced ejection fraction after myocardial infarction. What these patients have in common is prolonged neurohormonal activation, which theoretically may be harmful to myocardial cell structure and function. ACE inhibitors reduce the breakdown of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and increase the concentration of circulating bradykinins and prostaglandins. Further modulation of neurohormonal activity might be beneficial. Therefore, future treatment of chronic heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction might include beta-adrenergic blockers, neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, ANP, BNP, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and modulators of sympathetic activity.", 
    "659": "Meta-analyses of major outcome trials have demonstrated that the benefits of antihypertensive treatment for reduction of the incidence of stroke are entirely consistent with the benefits predicted from epidemiologic data; however, there remains a shortfall in the expected reduction of the incidence of coronary heart disease. Several explanations have been proffered to account for this shortfall, including the potential deleterious metabolic effects of long-term antihypertensive treatment; this has led to the speculation that antihypertensive agents with beneficial ancillary properties might confer additional significant advantage. However, with the exception of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, few of these agents have translated into clinical benefit for humans. In addition, sound reasons exist to justify a focus on maintaining and improving the \"quality\" of blood pressure control. Current evidence suggests that optimal benefit is likely to result from the use of pharmacologic strategies that lower blood pressure consistently over a 24-hour period while at the same time maintaining the \"normal\" circadian pattern of blood pressure. This result will only be achieved with drugs and drug regimens that genuinely offer long duration of action with the additional potential benefit of maintaining a significant blood pressure lowering effect beyond the end of the dosage interval. This factor is particularly important because many patients with hypertension demonstrate poor adherence to prescribed dosage regimens.", 
    "660": "The mechanisms through which hypertension contributes to the occurrence of myocardial infarction should be discussed from two points of view: (1) common risk factors for the two diseases, such as genetic risk, insulin resistance, sympathetic hyperactivity, and vasoactive substances such as angiotensin K, and (2) linking factors that are induced by hypertension and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, such as atherosclerosis and left ventricular hypertrophy. Mechanical stress on blood vessels because of high blood pressure is an especially important factor in endothelial dysfunction, the progression of atherosclerosis, and plaque rupture. This article concentrates on these factors from the perspective of their relationship with the renin-angiotensin system, because recent multicenter trials have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are effective for preventing recurrence of myocardial infarction.", 
    "661": "Heart failure is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Because heart failure is difficult to diagnose accurately on the basis of the history and physical examination alone, It is vital that clinical evaluation such as echocardiography be used to confirm the diagnosis. In addition, it is important to identify etiologic or predisposing factors that may be reversible. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be considered in all patients with a diagnosis of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, unless contraindications exist. Diuretics and digoxin are helpful in specific circumstances. Comorbid factors such as excessive alcohol intake and coronary artery insufficiency should be addressed. Patient and family education and cooperation with medical regimens can reduce morbidity and mortality.", 
    "662": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can be used to prevent the development of radiation nephropathy. Current studies were designed to determine whether blocking the angiotensin II (AII) receptor, rather than preventing the creation of AII, would be effective in the prophylaxis of radiation nephropathy. Rats received 17 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) in six fractions followed by syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Prior to TBI the rats were randomized to groups receiving an ACE inhibitor (captopril), an AII type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (L-158,809) or no treatment. Renal function was assessed over 40 weeks, and a subset of animals were sacrificed for histopathology at 33 weeks. Renal function deteriorated progressively in animals receiving TBI alone, leading to renal failure by 34 weeks. Renal function was significantly better in animals receiving either captopril or L-158,809, and none of these animals had progressed to renal failure by 43 weeks. Analysis of both renal function and histopathology shows that the AII receptor antagonist is more effective than the ACE inhibitor in the prophylaxis of BMT nephropathy. This indicates that a reduction of activation of the AT1 receptor by AII, by itself, is sufficient for the prophylaxis of radiation nephropathy.", 
    "663": "The role of nitric oxide (NO) in renal function was evaluated under conditions of elevated peripheral and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), achieved by bilateral carotid occlusion (CO) in anesthetized dogs. Renal function was monitored during CO with the NO system intact and with it blocked by the administration of L-NAME. With NO intact, CO increased arterial pressure and heart rate. With renal perfusion pressure held constant, CO also significantly decreased renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 46% and 43%, respectively. CO, after L-NAME administration, resulted in a significantly exaggerated renal vasoconstriction. RBF and GFR decreased by 82% and 80%, respectively. Changes in water and sodium excretion were not different between the NO-intact and NO-blocked states during CO. These studies were also performed with the converting enzyme inhibitor, Captopril. The exaggerated renal hemodynamic responses to CO with NO synthesis inhibition were identical with or without Captopril. These findings indicate that under conditions of elevated peripheral and RSNA, NO plays an important role in modulating renal hemodynamics, but not sodium excretion. This effect does not appear to involve angiotensin II.", 
    "664": "Cocaine exerts in the rat an inhibitory effect on the baroreflex induced by bilateral clamping of the carotid arteries. The present series of experiments were designed to test the effectiveness of cocaine antidotes on this deregulation of the baroreflex. Sprague-Dawley rats were fitted under pentobarbital anesthesia with a catheter in the caudal artery, and their carotid arteries were exposed. The pressure signal from the caudal artery was treated on line by a microcomputer for continuous display of blood pressure and heart rate measurements. The animals were administered intraperitoneally either 50 mg cocaine or an equal volume of saline. Five minutes later, they were administered either saline or proven antidotes to cocaine (diltiazem, nicardipine, enzyme converting inhibitor [ECI], enalaprilat associated with diazepam). After 2 min, stimulation of the baroreceptor was performed by bilateral clamping of the two carotids for a period of 2 min. The measures of the maximal variation in systolic pressure before and after clamping indicated a significant difference between saline and cocaine treated animals (P < 0.05), with the former displaying a much greater increment in blood pressure after clamping. The cocaine-treated animals, administered diltiazem, nicardipine, and ECI associated with diazepam, presented after clamping of the carotid arteries a normal baroreflex with increments in blood pressure not significantly different from those occurring in the animals receiving saline, but significantly different from those administered cocaine only (P < 0.05). Baroreflex deregulation by cocaine may also be restored by an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The possible role of this peptide in mediating in part baroreflex activity is discussed.", 
    "665": "To examine the effect of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the activity of retinal sodium-potassium ATPase (Na,K-ATPase) and the activity of ACE in the serum and retina of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.", 
    "666": "Experimental diabetes was induced in male Long-Evans rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (55 mg/kg body weight). Some groups of normal and diabetic animals were treated with captopril (10 mg/kg per day) added to the drinking water for either a week or a month. After 2 and 4 months of diabetes, the specific activity of retinal total Na,K-ATPase was determined. The components of the activity of Na,K-ATPase caused by the alpha 1 and alpha 3 isoforms were pharmacologically separated by their different sensitivity to ouabain. The activity of ACE in the serum and retina was measured by radioassay using benzoyl-gly-gly-gly as substrate (10(5) cpm, 5 mM).", 
    "667": "The total Na,K-ATPase activity was decreased significantly after 2 (16%, P < 0.02) and 4 months (15%, P < 0.02) of diabetes. At both time points examined, the activities of the alpha 1-low-ouabain-affinity isoform and the alpha 3-high-ouabain-affinity isoform of retinal Na,K-ATPase were significantly reduced compared to those of age-matched controls (alpha 1, 9% to 14%, P < 0.05; alpha 3, 14% to 19%, P < 0.05 and P < 0.02 respectively). After 1 month of captopril administration, the activities of both Na,K-ATPase isoforms were at control level in 2-month diabetic rats, whereas they were restored only partially in 4-month diabetic rats. In age-matched normal animals, 1 month of captopril treatment did not alter the specific activities of either Na,K-ATPase isoform. One week or 1 month of captopril administration to diabetic rats did not change the activities of retinal Na,K-ATPase isoforms. Serum ACE activity was elevated significantly in both groups of untreated STZ rats (55% and 40%, respectively). One month of captopril administration further increased the ACE levels in 2- and 4-month diabetic rats (101% and 94%, respectively) and also enhanced significantly the serum ACE activity in normal animals (131%) versus the basal values. In contrast, retinal ACE activity was decreased significantly in both groups of untreated STZ rats (approximately 37%). Captopril exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the retinal ACE activity in 2- and 4-month diabetic rats (37% and 31%, respectively) compared to untreated diabetic animals as well as in normal rats (29%).", 
    "668": "These data suggest that stimulation of retinal Na,K-ATPase activity in diabetes is most likely one of the mechanisms through which captopril can improve retinal complications. The effect of captopril seems to be related to local effects in the retina. Whether the inhibition of retinal ACE is part of the mechanism of action of captopril requires further study.", 
    "669": "In the present study, we studied angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptor messengers by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. We examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 healthy subjects and 50 subjects with primary hypertension, in whom angiotensin I-converting enzyme genotype was determined, before and after 15 days of treatment with different antihypertensive drugs. The medication included a calcium channel antagonist, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, and a beta 1-blocker. We also studied the relationship between AT1 receptor gene expression and biochemical parameters of the renin-angiotensin system. AT1 receptor messenger levels were positively correlated with plasma renin activity in both normotensive and untreated hypertensive subjects. Increases of this messenger and plasma angiotensin II levels were correlated with the D allele in the same individuals. AT1 receptor messenger levels decreased significantly with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment in subjects with the DD genotype, and a significant decrease was observed in subjects with the II and ID genotypes treated with a calcium antagonist. No changes were observed in mRNA with the beta 1-blocker. We conclude that the AT2 receptor is not expressed in peripheral leukocytes and that AT1 receptor messenger levels vary in relation to angiotensin I-converting enzyme genotype and pharmacological treatment. These results suggest that angiotensin I-converting enzyme genotype may be an important factor when deciding on antihypertensive therapy in individuals with primary hypertension.", 
    "670": "We examined whether the effect of Y-26763, an ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener, on cerebral blood flow is altered in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and, if altered, whether long-term antihypertensive treatment with cilazapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is capable of preventing the change. Cerebral blood flow during intracarotid infusion of Y-26763 was measured in anesthetized SHRSP and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) as control. Y-26763 increased cerebral blood flow in a dose-dependent manner in WKY, and glibenclamide, a selective inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, inhibited the Y-26763-induced increase in cerebral blood flow. In contrast, the response to Y-26763 in SHRSP was significantly impaired compared with that in WKY. Antihypertensive treatment with cilazapril lowered blood pressure toward normal and prevented the impaired response in cerebral blood flow to Y-26763 in SHRSP. These findings suggest that (1) ATP-sensitive potassium channels contribute to the regulation of cerebral blood flow in rats, (2) the response to an ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener is markedly diminished in hypertensive rats, and (3) the altered response to an ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener during chronic hypertension can be prevented by long-term antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "671": "Resistance to the capacity of insulin to suppress lipolysis may be an important link in the association between abdominal obesity and hypertension. Furthermore, a more active renin-angiotensin system in adipose tissue may contribute to insulin-resistant lipolysis in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. We determined nonesterified fatty acid concentrations and turnover as well as lipid oxidation under basal conditions and during steady-state euglycemia with two levels of insulinemia (72 and 287 pmol/L) in lean normotensive, abdominally obese normotensive, and abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. To assess the role of the renin-angiotensin system in determining non-esterified fatty acid turnover, we repeated studies in the abdominally obese hypertensive subjects after double-blind random assignment to placebo or enalapril for 1 month each. The main findings were the following: (1) Nonesterified fatty acid flux was significantly higher in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects at both levels of insulinemia than in either abdominally obese normotensive or lean normotensive subjects and correlated significantly with both mean blood pressure and total systemic resistance during the higher level of insulinemia. (2) Enalapril significantly improved insulin-resistant lipolysis in the abdominally obese hypertensive subjects. The improvement in insulin suppressibility of nonesterified fatty acid flux at the high hormonal concentrations correlated positively with the magnitude of reduction in blood pressure. (3) Basal lipid oxidation and suppression in response to insulin were similarly impaired in both obese groups. Resistance to the antilipolytic actions of insulin is thus a characteristic feature in abdominally obese hypertensive subjects and may be linked to the elevated blood pressure in these individuals. A more active renin-angiotensin system may partly explain the insulin-resistant lipolysis in this form of hypertension.", 
    "672": "Cough accompanied by an increased sensitivity of the cough reflex is the most common symptom of inflammatory airway disease. This symptom is also frequently reported in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as therapy for heart failure or hypertension, although the underlying mechanism is unknown. We have investigated the possibility that the inflammatory peptide bradykinin, normally degraded by ACE, causes sensitization of airway sensory nerves and an enhancement of the cough reflex in conscious guinea pigs. Treatment of guinea pigs for two weeks with captopril led to an increased cough response to inhaled citric acid, which was prevented by concomitant treatment with the bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant. A similar icatibant-sensitive enhancement of citric acid-evoked cough was seen in untreated animals after prior inhalation of bradykinin, although cough evoked by hypertonic saline was unaffected. In electrophysiological studies performed in vitro, responses of single vagal C fibers to capsaicin, applied to receptive fields of single-fiber units in the trachea, were also markedly increased after perfusion with bradykinin, whereas A delta fiber responses to hypertonic saline were unaffected. These results indicate that bradykinin-evoked sensitization of airway sensory nerves may underlie the pathogenesis of ACE-inhibitor cough. Bradykinin receptor antagonists may be of benefit in treating chronic cough seen with this and other inflammatory conditions.", 
    "673": "A high serum cholesterol level is regarded as a major contributor to the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Screening for hyperlipidemia should begin no later than age 35 for men and age 45 for women. Individuals with additional risk factors for coronary artery disease should be screened earlier. When values are not within a desirable range, further assessment should be done by determining high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. The initial approach to treatment of hyperlipidemia includes diet, exercise, and weight loss. Smoking should be proscribed. When nonpharmacologic intervention fails, \"statins\" are increasingly being selected as agents of first choice. Recommendations for the busy practitioner include consistently identifying the hyperlipidemic patient, setting target goals for lipid values, addressing modifiable risk factors, and providing appropriate pharmacologic intervention (eg, aspirin, antioxidants, and beta blockers in patients with established disease; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with systolic dysfunction; estrogen replacement in selected patients) and treatment to attain target goals in lowering cholesterol.", 
    "674": "Hypertension is a common finding in patients with renal parenchymatous diseases. Development of hypertension causes increased proteinuria, decline in glomerular filtration rate and reduced life span in experimental models of glomerulonephritis. Hypertension has been shown to reduce glomerular filtration rate in man. It is therefore important to treat hypertension. The blood pressure should be reduced to about 140/80 mm Hg. Reduction of glomerular capillary pressure, inhibition of glomerular permeability, renal hypertrophy and inhibition of mesangial metabolism are the main mechanisms of renal protection during antihypertensive therapy. Autoregulation of the renal blood flow probably has an impact on these mechanisms. Impaired autoregulation is found in kidneys with low glomerular filtration rate and during treatment with calcium channel blockers. Alpha receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-) and angiotensin II receptor blockers do not interfere with autoregulation. All types of antihypertensive drugs provide similar renal protection when the glomerular filtration rate is reduced. When calcium channel blockers are used in kidneys with normal or slightly reduced function, either blood pressure should be kept strictly at normal levels or these type of drugs should be combined with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers.", 
    "675": "Heart failure is a disease which involves not only the heart but the entire circulatory system. Progression is directly related to interactions between myocardial disorders and neurohormonal and circulatory phenomena. Advances in treatment have resulted more from the development of vasodilator drugs with neurohormonal effects than from drugs with a direct effect on the myocardium. Diuretics are essential due to their rapid functional effect and the reduction in pressure on the ventricle wall. The effectiveness of digitalics is recognized not only in patients with atrial fibrillation, but also in those in sinus rhythm with ischemic heart disease. Conversion enzyme inhibitors are useful in all stages of heart failure, improving both quality of life and life expectancy as well as limiting myocardial and vascular remodeling and retarding progression of ventricular dysfunction. As current progress in the treatment of heart failure has not greatly reduced mortality, prevention is the major challenge facing all physicians. Treatment of asymptomatic ventricular function is one rational approach.",

    "683": "Mercaptoacyl dipeptides, containing a glycine linked to a C-terminal 5-phenylproline, have been synthesized in order to obtain new highly efficient dual inhibitors of the two zinc metallopeptidases, neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which are involved in the control of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. These compounds have been designed (i) to fit optimally the ACE pharmacophore previously described (Fourni\u00e9-Zaluski, M. C.; et al. J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 1070-1083), through interaction with the S1, S1', and S2' subsites of this enzyme, (ii) and to interact with the S1' and S2' subsites of NEP with the 5-phenylproline moiety outside the catalytic domain (Coric, P.; et al. J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 1210-1219). Replacement of Gly by Ala in these mercaptoacyl dipeptides induced an about 100-fold decrease in ACE inhibition. This shows that, in agreement with molecular modeling studies, a steric constraint as weak as a methyl group hinders optimal ACE active site recognition. Among these compounds, the dual inhibitor 26 (RB 106) (Ki, ACE = 0.35 nM; NEP = 1.6 nM) showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties with an almost complete in vivo inhibition of NEP and ACE for more than 4 h after oral administration in mice of a low dose (2.6 x 10(-5) mol/kg) of the inhibitor. Moreover, RB 106 remained active 12 h after oral administration. In spontaneous hypertensive rats, a chronic treatment of orally administered RB 106 (25 mg/kg/day) induced a prolonged hypotensive effect (-28 mmHg) still significant 2 days after the end of the treatment. In DOCA salt rats, a hypotensive response and a significant natriuresis were observed after i.v. administration. RB 106, which is one of the most potent dual inhibitors described to date, could have interesting clinical applications in long term treatment of congestive heart failure and myocardial ischemia.", 
    "684": "Although it is well known that mechanical load to cardiac muscles causes cardiac hypertrophy, little is known about how mechanical load is transduced into the activation of intracellular signals which are linked to cell growth. We investigated whether the cardiac renin-angiotensin system was involved in stretch-induced hypertrophy of cultured neonatal rat heart myocytes. Myocytes were cultured with serum-free medium in a deformable silicon dish. Stretch of cardiac myocytes significantly increased the protein/DNA ratio at culture days 6 and 7, and the RNA/DNA ratio at culture days 4 and 5. Stretch significantly accelerated rates of protein synthesis by 15%. c-fos mRNA expression was significantly increased after stretch. The stimulatory effects of cell stretch on these parameters were significantly inhibited by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, or the type 1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan. The concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II in culture media were significantly increased by stretch. Stretch did not change the angiotensin converting enzyme activity. These studies demonstrate that mechanical stretch activates the cardiac renin-angiotensin system in a autocrine and paracrine system which acts as an initial mediator of the stretch-induced hypertrophic growth.", 
    "685": "Verapamil is effective as antianginal medication but contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure but have limited effect on patients with angina pectoris. No studies have been published on the combined treatment with verapamil and ACE inhibitors in patients with stable angina pectoris and left ventricular dysfunction. We performed an open study in 14 patients with angina pectoris and ejection fraction < 40%. The patients received verapamil 180 mg and trandolapril 2 mg twice daily for 3 months. We found a significant increase in ejection fraction from 28 +/- 6 to 35 +/- 11 (p < 0.03), wall motion index from 1.0 +/- 0.3 to 1.2 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.03), exercise duration from 6.9 +/- 2.5 to 7.7 +/- 2.9 minutes (p < 0.01), and ratio of exercise to rest rate-pressure product from 2.2 +/- 0.4 to 2.5 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.02). Use of nitroglycerin and number of angina pectoris attacks were both significantly reduced after 3 months of treatment. These findings support the hypothesis that the combination of verapamil and trandolapril is useful in patients with attenuated left ventricular function and angina pectoris.",

Prior to hypoxic exposure, cells were pretreated for 90 min with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cyclopenta[b]pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, 1-[2-[(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)amino]-l-oxopropyl]octahydro-[2S-[1[R* (R*)]2 alpha, 3a beta, 6a beta]] (ramiprilat), concomitantly with ramiprilat and H-D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-Tic-Oic-Arg-OH (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE 140), the bioactive peptide Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg (bradykinin) or concomitantly with bradykinin and HOE 140. Hypoxia/reoxygenation injury to untreated control cardiac myocytes was characterized by a significant loss of sarcolemmal integrity measured at 75 +/- 4% of total cell fluorescence (mean +/- S.E., n = 42 cultures). Compared to propidium iodide staining of the above untreated control myocytes, those pretreated with 30 or 100 microM ramiprilat showed a significant reduction of propidium iodide staining to 45 +/- 9% and 40 +/- 8% (n = 9, P < 0.05) of untreated controls, respectively. Pretreatment with the protective concentrations of ramiprilat concomitant with 10 microM HOE 140 abolished the significant reduction in propidium iodide staining observed with ramiprilat alone. Similarly, pretreatment with 10 or 100 nM bradykinin significantly reduced propidium iodide staining to 35 +/- 5% and 60 +/- 10% (n = 6, P < 0.05) of the untreated hypoxic controls, respectively. In addition, concomitant pretreatment with protective concentrations of bradykinin and 10 microM HOE 140 also abolished the significant reduction in propidium iodide staining observed with bradykinin alone. The results indicate that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat has a protective effect on isolated cardiac myocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation and that this effect is most likely related to a local action of bradykinin on the cardiac myocyte via the activation of the kinin B2 receptor.", 
    "687": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for the determination of captopril in human plasma. 1-Benzyl-2-chloropyridinium bromide (BCPB) was used as a precolumn derivatizing reagent. The mercapto group of captopril was arylated by the reagent to generate a stable UV-sensitive product. The derivative was solid-phase extracted (SPE), separated on a C18 column using reversed-phase ion-paring chromatography and monitored by a spectrophotometric detector at 314 nm. The method enabled sensitive determination of captopril and its disulphides in human plasma in patients after oral administration. Disulphides of captopril with captopril itself and with endogenous thiol compounds are reduced with triphenylphosphine to form captopril, followed by derivatization with the same reagent. The quantification limit was 10 ng/ml. Calibration curves were prepared for human plasma samples spiked with captopril and captopril disulphide. The calibration curves were linear in the range of 10 to 500 ng/ml for captopril and 10 to 1000 ng/ml for captopril disulphide."
