Given the fact that the rat lung undergoes postnatal development, the mammalian lung possesses the highest angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels and ACE activity increases during the first weeks postpartum, we tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibition influences postnatal lung development. Rats were given the ACE inhibitor enalapril (10 mg kg(-1)) from 0 to 9 days of age and their lungs were examined at day 4 and 9. Lung structure was evaluated by means of light microscopy, and surface tension of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was measured by means of a Wilhelmy balance. Neonatal ACE inhibition lowered the surface tension of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and caused widening of respiratory airspaces and thinning of alveolar septa. Our results suggest that early postnatal ACE inhibition in rats interferes with lung development.", 
    "1": "A little more than a decade ago, management of heart failure was changed forever when a number of randomized clinical trials confirmed that a class of drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, could improve survival in patients with heart failure. The recognition that blockade of one of the neurohumoral systems activated in heart failure could improve outcomes prompted widespread testing of other neurohumoral blockers, such as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, aldosterone antagonists, and most recently, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) for the treatment of heart failure. This article describes what is known about the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the management of heart failure and presents the current controversies surrounding the use of these agents.", 
    "2": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia seen in clinical practice. The understanding of the pathophysiology of AF has changed drastically during the last several decades. Recent observations have challenged the concept of the multiple circuit reentry model in favor of single focus or single circuit reentry models. Atrial electrical dysfunction provides a favorable substrate and transmembrane ionic currents are key determinants. Interest has also been generated in the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in reversing the electrical and structural remodeling. Reverting to the sinus rhythm seems to be the best way for reverse remodeling of atria during atrial fibrillation. Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are only modestly effective. Of these amiodarone seems to provide the most benefits. Drugs like verapamil and ACE inhibitors may also help as adjuvant therapies in the reverse remodeling of atria. Nonpharmacological methods have been used to control both rate and rhythm for patients with AF. Recently, there has been a surge in interest to focal ablation of atrial foci. Focal sources of AF are commonly found in pulmonary veins (PV). Ablation in pulmonary veins through identification of the earliest endocardial activation has met with variable success. Anatomical approaches have involved circumferential radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary vein ostia using novel techniques such as balloon based circumferential ultrasound ablation system and circular cryoablation catheter. Most recently the segmental approach is preferred because the myocardial fibers surrounding the PV are not continuous. Segments where musculature is present can be identified using high frequency depolarization signals recorded through multi-electrode loop catheter or even conventional catheters.", 
    "3": "It is generally accepted that regulation of blood pressure and sympathetic neurotransmission by angiotensin (Ang) II is brought about through activation of AT1-receptors. Since recent studies demonstrated a high proportion of AT2-receptors in the human heart, the aim of our study was to investigate whether Ang II modulates noradrenaline release also through activation of AT2-receptors in this tissue. Human atrial appendages were prelabeled with [3H]-noradrenaline and electrically field-stimulated. Stimulation-induced outflow of radioactivity was taken as an index of endogenous noradrenaline release. Ang I and II enhanced noradrenaline release in a dose-dependent manner up to 55 and 72%, respectively. These effects were blocked by the selective AT1-receptor antagonists EXP3174 and irbesartan (10 nmol/L). Moreover, the selective AT2-receptor antagonists PD123319 and CGP42112A (0.1 and 1 micromol/L) also inhibited Ang II-induced facilitation of noradrenaline release. Captopril (5 micromol/L) shifted the dose response curve for Ang I less potent to the right than EXP3174 (10 nmol/L). Ang I and II enhanced the stimulation-induced noradrenaline release significantly more potent in tissues of patients pretreated with ACE inhibitors than without. In conclusion, both AT1- and AT2-receptors seem to play a role in Ang II-mediated facilitation of noradrenaline release in the human heart. Chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors appears to affect cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission possibly by upregulation of presynaptic Ang II receptors.", 
    "4": "We investigated the effect of different ACE inhibitors on tissue injury in isolated rat hearts subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. Zofenoprilat (1-100 microM), but not enalaprilat or lisinopril, significantly reduced infarct size, as estimated on the basis of triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The protection was not reproduced by the angiotensin II receptor antagonist irbesartan, and it was partly abolished by the bradykinin receptor antagonist HOE 140. Zofenoprilat molecule contains a sulfhydryl group, and its administration, as compared with enalaprilat or lisinopril administration, was associated with better preservation of protein thiols at the end of ischemia. We conclude that zofenopril has a specific cardioprotective effect, which might be related either to interference with bradykinin metabolism or to preservation of protein sulfhydryl groups.", 
    "5": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are known to attenuate the effects of some antihypertensive agents. However, the effect these drugs have on leukocyte migration when combined with antihypertensive agents has not been studied. To investigate this effect, we treated spontaneously hypertensive rats with saline, diclofenac, enalapril, or diclofenac combined with enalapril and observed leukocyte-endothelium interaction. Blood pressure was increased by diclofenac, reduced by enalapril and reduced by the combination of the two. Diclofenac did not interfere with the blood pressure-lowering effect of enalapril. Internal spermatic fascia venules were observed using intravital microscopy. Diclofenac reduced rollers, whereas enalapril, alone or combined with diclofenac, had no significant effect on rollers. All treatments reduced adherent and migrated leukocytes and expression of endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Venular shear rate, venular diameters, number of circulating leukocytes, and post-leukotriene B4 expression of l-selectin and CD11/CD18 integrin in leukocytes were unaffected by any treatment. Expression of P-selectin was reduced by diclofenac and unaffected by enalapril, even when combined with diclofenac. Our data suggest that, although diclofenac does not interfere with the enalapril anti-hypertensive effect, enalapril interferes with the effect diclofenac has on leukocyte rolling and endothelial P-selectin expression. Involvement of reduced endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression might explain the lower numbers of adherent and migrated leukocytes. The anti-inflammatory properties of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug could therefore be attenuated in hypertensive patients receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "6": "In the present investigation we sought to determine if a perinatal high-salt treatment affects blood pressure at an early age (30 days), and if so, to determine the mechanisms responsible for the hypertension. Pregnant dams were given an 8% NaCl diet [high-salt (HS) rats] during the final one-third of gestation and throughout the suckling period. After weaning, the pups continued to receive the high-salt diet until testing at age 30 days. Control groups received a normal-salt diet (NS rats). In HS rats, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly increased (110 +/- 5 vs. 96 +/- 3 mmHg) compared with NS rats. Blockade of brain AT(1) receptors with intracerebroventricular losartan decreased MAP in HS but not NS rats. Blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors with intravenous phentolamine or ganglionic transmission with intravenous chlorisondamine produced a greater decrease in MAP in HS rats. Baroreflex control of heart rate was assessed using a four-parameter logistics function. The mid-range MAP (p3) was significantly increased in the HS rats. No other baroreflex parameters were affected. Specific binding of (125)I-[Sa (1),Ile(8)]ANG II to AT(1) receptors was increased in the subfornical organ (SFO) of the HS rats. Expression of AT(1a) receptor mRNA was greater in both SFO and PVN of the HS rats. These data suggest that even at an early age, Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a perinatal high-salt diet are hypertensive. The elevated blood pressure appears to be caused by increased sympathetic nervous activity, resulting, in part, from increased brain AT(1) receptor activation.", 
    "7": "We undertook a meta-analysis of large, randomized controlled trials in hypertensive subjects that compared angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with different classes of antihypertensive drugs. Compared with subjects randomized to drugs different from ACE inhibitors, those treated with ACE inhibitors did not show a different risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) (odds ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.12, p = 0.407). The degree of protection from CHF associated with the use of ACE inhibitors showed a nonsignificant trend to increase with age and the degree of blood pressure control. Thus, the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive drugs for prevention of CHF in hypertension remains unproven.", 
    "8": "The goal of this study was to determine if a low-dose combination of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (Per) and the diuretic indapamide (Ind) reduces central (thoracic aorta, carotid artery) as well as brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP) more than the beta-blocker atenolol and to determine the hemodynamic factors influencing independently brachial and central SBP: pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pattern of wave reflections.", 
    "9": "In high cardiovascular risk populations, angiotensin blockade improves survival without affecting brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Whether central SBP, which is physiologically lower than brachial SBP, is significantly reduced has never been investigated.", 
    "10": "This study was a double-blind randomized trial for one year in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "11": "For a similar DBP reduction, Per/Ind decreased SBP significantly more than atenolol, with a more pronounced reduction for central than for brachial SBP. After one year, the difference between brachial and central SBP was maintained by Per/Ind (8.28 +/- 1.53 mm Hg) and significantly attenuated by atenolol (0.29 +/- 1.61 mm Hg). Under atenolol, the principal factor modulating SBP reduction was mean blood pressure. Under Per/Ind, this parameter played a minor role, and the central SBP reduction implied a major role for disturbed PWV and wave reflections.", 
    "12": "Under Per/Ind, but not atenolol, normalization of brachial SBP is achieved with a significantly greater reduction of central SBP. This hemodynamic profile reflects changes of wave reflections issued from distal arterial and arteriolar territory, where Per/Ind, but not atenolol, is known to improve vessel wall structure.", 
    "13": "Peptides that display bradykinin-potentiating activity have been obtained from a number of distinct sources, such as snake venoms, fibrinogen, and casein. This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108-113 and 114-121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response.", 
    "14": "Long-term treatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown to decrease the plasma renin activity (PRA) of hypertensive patients, whereas PRA remains elevated during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatment. In the present study, we used rat juxtaglomerular (JG) cells to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in the differential regulation of PRA between ARB and ACEI treatment. Addition of 100 nmol/l angiotensinogen (Aogen) to JG cells (n=6 primary cultures) significantly increased the medium angiotensin (Ang) II levels from 14 +/- 2 to 440 +/- 9 pg/ml and suppressed the renin secretion rate (RSR) from 39.6 +/- 5.4% to 6.3 +/- 1.8% without affecting active renin content (ARC) or total renin content (TRC). In the Aogen-treated cells, the ACEI, delapril hydrochloride (CV3317, 10 micromol/l), significantly decreased the medium Ang II levels to 58 +/- 14 pg/ml and increased RSR to 39.8 +/- 4.1% without affecting ARC or TRC. The ARB, an active metabolite of candesartan cilexetil (CV11974, 10 micromol/l), however, significantly increased the medium Ang II levels and RSR to 486 +/- 15 pg/ml and 40.9 +/- 9.8%, respectively, and decreased ARC from 63.2 +/- 6.8 to 21.6 +/- 3.6 ng of Ang l x h(-1) x million cells(-1) without affecting TRC. The decreases in ARC of the Aogen+CV11974-treated cells (n=6 primary cultures) were inhibited by an Ang II type 2 receptor blocker, PD123319 (10 micromol/l). JG cells (n=6 primary cultures) were also treated with an Ang II type 2 receptor agonist, CGP42212A (0.1 micromol/l). CGP42212A significantly increased RSR from 38.2 +/- 1.6% to 49.7 +/- 4.7% and decreased ARC from 60.8 +/- 3.0 to 25.3 +/- 2.8 ng of Ang l x h(-1) million cells(-1) without affecting TRC. Addition of CV11974 did not alter the RSR, ARC, or TRC of the CGP42212A-treated cells; however, PD123319 abolished the effects of CGP42212A. These results indicate that, distinct from ACEIs, ARBs inhibit prorenin processing of JG cells through Ang II type 2 receptors. Long-term treatment with an ARB may decrease PRA in part by diminishing the storage of active renin in JG cells.", 
    "15": "A high-fructose diet (HFD) has been shown to elevate blood pressure (BP) and to decrease insulin sensitivity in rats. Although running exercise can attenuate these phenomena, its effect on target organ protection is not clear. We investigated whether exercise training has renal protective effects in this model. Nine-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were allocated to groups that received HFD or a control diet (control group) for 15 weeks. At the age of 10 weeks, fructose-fed rats were allocated to groups that were given vehicle (FRU group), temocapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (TEM group), exercise training (EX group; treadmill running), or temocapril plus exercise training (TEM+EX group). BP was higher in the FRU group than in the control group. Exercise training tended to decrease BP and temocapril treatment decreased BP significantly. Proteinuria was similar in the five groups. Plasma leptin concentration and epididymal fat weight were lower in the EX and TEM+EX groups than in the FRU group. In the soleus muscle of the FRU group, the composite ratio of type I fiber was decreased and that of type IIa fiber was increased compared with those in the control group. Both temocapril and exercise training restored these ratios. The glomerular sclerosis index (GSI) was higher in the FRU group than in the control group. GSI was decreased equally in the TEM, EX, and TEM+EX groups and was positively correlated with plasma leptin concentration. The results suggest that exercise training ameliorates glomerular sclerosis through mechanisms other than a reduction in BP.", 
    "16": "Abnormal Ca2+ handling and enhanced aggregation response have been reported in platelets from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and patients with essential hypertension, and thought to be involved in the progression of target organ damage of hypertension. It is important to examine whether antihypertensive therapy can improve the abnormal platelet response in hypertension. We investigated the effect of antihypertensive treatment such as amlodipine and cilazapril on Ca2+ handling and aggregation response in SHR platelets. Four-week-old male SHR were divided into three groups. Each group was treated with amiodipine (A: 10 mg/kg/day), cilazapril (C: 10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (V) for 8 weeks by gavage. At 12-week-old, platelet [Ca2+]i was measured with fura-2 in each group of SHR and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) as normal control. Systolic blood pressure in amlodipine and cilazapril treated groups were similar with WKY and significantly lower than vehicle treated group (A: 124 +/- 9, C: 126 +/- 9, WKY: 122 +/- 10 and V: 180 +/- 9 mmHg, respectively). The basal [Ca2+]i in the three groups of SHR were similar and higher than WKY (A: 47 +/- 1.7, C: 47 +/- 1.2, V: 48 +/- 3.9 and WKY: 40 +/- 4.0 nmol/l, respectively). There were no significant differences in thrombin (0.1 U/ml)-stimulated [Ca2+]i rise in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ among the three groups of SHR and these were higher than WKY. Intracellular Ca2+ discharge capacity, assessed by the ionomycinstimulation was similar in the all groups. Thrombin-induced maximum platelet aggregation responses in the three groups of SHR were similar and higher than WKY. The antihypertensive treatment of Ca2+ antagonist or ACE inhibitor gave no change in intraplatelet Ca2+ metabolism in SHR. These results support the hypothesis that an abnormal Ca2+ handling in SHR platelet is genetically determined and not improved by hypotensive therapy.", 
    "17": "The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between polymorphism of the anglotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and the blood pressure response to ACE inhibition in a hypertensive cohort. Imidapril (5-10 mg/day) or benazepril (10-20 mg/day) was administered for 6 weeks to 517 essential hypertensives. ACE gene polymorphism was examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and the patients were classified as having the 190-bp deletion homozygous (DD) genotype, the 490-bp insertion homozygous (II) genotype, or the 490-bp insertion, 190-bp deletion heterozygous (ID) genotype. The achieved change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) was analyzed for association with genotypes at the ACE gene locus. The DD genotype was observed in 132 patients (25.5%), the ID genotype in 255 patients (49.3%), and the II genotype in 130 patients (25.2%). The SBP reductions in the patients with the DD genotype, II genotype, and ID genotype were -14.5 +/- 12.7 mmHg, -14.3 +/- 13.1 mmHg and -14.0 +/- 12.2 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.94). The DBP reductions in the patients with the DD genotype, II genotype, and ID genotype were -8.7 +/- 7.4 mmHg, -8.7 +/- 7.7 mmHg and -8.5 +/- 6.7 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.96). There was no significant association between the ACE gene polymorphisms and the response to ACE inhibition. These results suggest that ACE genotype does not predict the blood pressure-lowering response to antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibition.", 
    "18": "It has becoming clear that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) show varying levels of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocking activity. Although the duration of activity and the efficacy on blood pressure of ARB are reported to vary, depending on the agents used, it has not been examined whether the effects on proteinuria and urinary nitrite/nitrate (NOx) excretion differ in hypertensive patients with chronic renal disease. In the present study, patients with hypertension (> 140 and/or 90 mmHg) and chronic renal disease (proteinuria > 0.5g/day; serum creatinine < 265 micromol/l or creatinine clearance > 30 ml/min/1.72 m2) were randomly assigned to perindopril- (n = 15), trandolapril- (n = 15), candesartan- (n = 17), and losartan-treated groups (n = 15), and were followed up for 96 weeks. All agents decreased blood pressure to the same level, and none of them had any effect on creatinine clearance. Candesartan, perindopril, and trandolapril reduced proteinuria markedly (from 3.0 +/- 0.6 to 1.8 +/- 0.5 g/day, 2.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.6 +/- 0.4 g/day, and 2.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.7 +/- 0.4 g/day, respectively) at 12 weeks, and the beneficial effect persisted throughout the study. The effect of losartan, however, diminished over the study period. Whereas perindopril, trandolapril, and candesartan markedly increased urinary NOx excretion (from 257 +/- 23 to 1,011 +/- 150 micromol/day, 265 +/- 70 to 986 +/- 130 micromol/day, and 260 +/- 62 to 967 +/- 67 micromol/day at 12 weeks, respectively), a relatively blunted increase was observed with losartan (from 309 +/- 42 to 596 +/- 64 micromol/day). In conclusion, renal action of ARB varies, with relatively less proteinuria-sparing, as well as NOx-enhancing, effects observed with candesartan showing the greatest reduction of proteinuria and greatest enhancement of NOx. Furthermore, renal nitric oxide may contribute to the renal protective action of these agents when administered to patients with chronic renal disease.",

    "20": "The effect of an angiotensin II blockade in lowering the portal pressure in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension is controversial. This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the portal hypotensive effect of captopril compared to that of propranolol, and to determine the factors that contribute to a successful reduction in the portal pressure after longterm captopril administration in patients with liver cirrhosis.", 
    "21": "The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and portal venous velocity (PVV) were measured both before and 3 months after initiation of the administration of captopril (n = 29) or propranolol (n = 29) in cirrhotic patients with a variceal bleeding episode. Patients who showed a reduction in the HVPG of more than 20% of the baseline were defined as being responders.", 
    "22": "At 3 months, the mean reduction in the HVPG after captopril was less than that after propranolol (-3.0 +/- 9.3% vs -28.5% +/- 4.1%; P < 0.05). However, of the 29 patients receiving captopril, 9 were classified as being responders. On multivariate analysis with parameters including age, cause, Child-Pugh score, HVPG, and PVV, only low PVV was found to be a significant independent factor for responders (PVV < 12 cm/s; odds ratio [OR], 12.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-102.40) in the captopril group.", 
    "23": "Longterm captopril administration reduces the portal pressure effectively in cirrhotic patients with a low PVV. This suggests that the reduction in portal pressure after captopril administration is a result of improved portal venous outflow brought about by a decrease in the intrahepatic vascular resistance. When the PVV is below 12 cm/s, a captopril trial might be useful in preventing variceal bleeding in portal hypertensive patients.", 
    "24": "A 24-year-old woman was admitted to Toyosaka Hospital with proteinuria, hematuria, lymphopenia, hypocomplementemia, positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), and elevation of anti-streptolysin O (ASO). Renal biopsy specimen revealed diffuse mesangial and endocapillary glomerulonephritis with crescent formation and duplication of the capillary loop on light microscopic examination. Mild to moderate proliferation of mesangial matrix and cells were observed. On immunofluorescence (IF) examination, deposition of IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q, C3, and C4 to the mesangium and capillary wall were observed. By electron microscopy (EM), mesangial, subendothelial, and subepithelial deposits were recognized. However, microtubular structure in glomerular endothelial cells, fingerprint structures, and circumferential mesangial interposition were not observed by EM. The patient was referred to our hospital, but there was no change in her proteinuria 3 weeks after admission. The elevation of ASO, hypocomplementemia, and endocapillary proliferation suggested acute glomerulonephritis, while lymphocytopenia, positive ANA, the persistent hypocomplementemia, and various deposits detected by IF and EM suggested lupus nephritis; however, she did not fulfill the classification criteria of systemic lupus erythematosus. We started prednisolone (40 mg/day) with the diagnosis of chronic glomerulonephritis revealing diffuse mesangial and endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis, but it was not effective for the proteinuria. Quinapril (10 mg/day) and losartan (25 to 50 mg/day) were administered and the proteinuria decreased. It is possible that this use of an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist was effective in reducing the proteinuria in this patient.",

Group B consisted of 18 patients who had baseline characteristics similar to those of the patients in group A and were treated with our previous protocol (a combination of prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and dipyridamole).

    "29": "The GapC products of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis share considerable homology at the DNA and amino acid levels. The high similarity at the protein level suggests that one GapC protein might be used as a single antigen to protect dairy cows against infections with the contagious S. agalactiae and the environmental S. dysgalactiae and S. uberis strains. Despite their similarities, immunization with the S. dysgalactiae GapC did not protect dairy cows from a challenge with S. uberis, suggesting the presence of regions in GapC that are involved in species-specific protection. To produce a single antigen that can be used to protect against all streptococcal mastitis infections, we constructed a GapC chimeric protein using the S. uberis GapC product as the backbone followed by non-conserved peptide regions from the S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae GapC proteins. We report that the chimeric GapC protein retains the enzymatic activity of the S. uberis GapC protein. In addition, we fused the chimera to the OmpF and LipoF transport sequences of Escherichia coli and the GapC chimeras were present in membrane fractions of E. coli. These extracts could be the basis of an antigen preparation for use in mastitis vaccines.", 
    "30": "The aim of this study was to compare the regressive effect of clinidipine on left ventricular mass (LVM) with that of quinapril. Sixty patients with mild essential hypertension aged more than 39 years were randomly allocated to two groups to receive cilnidipine (10 mg; n = 30) or quinapril (10 mg; n = 30). The patients underwent echocardiography before and 12 months after drug treatment. Sixteen patients in each group underwent 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac imaging before and 12 months after drug treatment. In both groups systolic and diastolic blood pressures significantly decreased to similar levels. In the clinidipine group, both end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters and posterior wall thickness significantly decreased, while only end-systolic diameter significantly decreased in the quinapril group. However, LVM (206 +/- 36 g to 189 +/- 40 g, p < 0.02 for the quinapril group, 195 +/- 60 g to 171 +/- 48 g, p < 0.004 for the clinidipine group) and the LVM index (127 +/- 20 g/m2, to 116 +/- 20 g/m2, p < 0.02 for the quinapril group, 121 +/- 32 g/m2 to 106 +/- 24 g/m2 p < 0.003 for the clinidipine group) significantly decreased in both groups. Regarding MIBG imaging, in the cilnidipine group, the heart-to-mediastinum ratio significantly increased (p < 0.02) and the washout rate significantly decreased (p < 0.02) after drug treatment. In contrast, there were no significant changes in MIBG parameters in the quinapril group. Clinidipine produced a greater decrease in LVM in essential hypertension than quinapril, probably due to the long-term suppression of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system. Clinidipine is useful for hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and may improve their prognosis.",

    "33": "A positive effect of verapamil on the baseline impaired EDVD is realized only in the presence of an adequate compensation of glycemia, at the normal blood level of cortisol, occurs in parallel with increased nonendothelium-dependent vasoreactivity, and associates with the magnitude of an antihypertensive effect. ACE inhibitors improve decreased EDVD irrespective of the degree of glycemic control, the blood level of cortisol without a clear correlation with the altered non-endothelium-dependent vasoreactivity and with the degree of an antihypertensive effect. Combined therapy with these agents causes decreases in baseline insulinemia and the athoregenicity index and it can improve impaired vasoreactivity even in case of incomplete antihypertensive therapeutic effect.",

Patients received telmisartan 40-80 mg once daily for 12 weeks and could participate in the study for up to 96 weeks, or until a marketed supply of telmisartan became available. Mean change from baseline in mean seated trough diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after 12 weeks' treatment, the primary endpoint, was -11.8 mmHg in the intent-to-treat population. The corresponding mean change in mean seated trough systolic blood pressure (SBP) was -20.2 mmHg. Both changes were statistically significant. Mean DBP and SBP reductions were apparent from week 4 and maintained throughout the treatment period. Telmisartan was well tolerated; the most common adverse events were headache (6%) and dizziness (3%), and 10% of adverse events were considered drug-related. In conclusion, telmisartan is an effective and well-tolerated drug when used as monotherapy or add-on treatment in this broad population of patients.", 
    "36": "The number of patients requiring chronic renal replacement therapy due to hypertension and diabetic nephropathy has increased steadily over the past decade in Switzerland. The level of blood pressure represents one of the major risk factors for the progression of renal diseases. Thus, treatment of hypertension is the cornerstone in the primary and secondary prevention of diabetic nephropathy and in particular in decreasing the rate of progression of chronic renal diseases. The WHO guidelines for the treatment of hypertension recommend a target blood pressure of < 130/80 mmHg for patients with renal failure and/or diabetes mellitus. Blood pressure should be lowered to < 125/75 mmHg in patients with proteinuria > 1 g/d and renal failure regardless of the etiology of the renal disease. Based on several intervention studies it is well established that antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system should be part of the antihypertensive regime in those patients. Besides their antihypertensive action, it has become evident that the renoprotective effect of these agents is also mediated by factors independent from changes in blood pressure. However, in most patients with chronic renal failure it is often necessary to use multiple drugs to lower blood pressure to target values. Often a combination of an ACE-inhibitor with a calcium-channel blocker is used for this purpose. The goal of the antihypertensive therapy in these patients is not only to lower blood pressure to reduce cardiovascular risk, but also to reduce proteinuria and to reduce the rate of loss in renal function or even prevent further progression.", 
    "37": "Diastolic heart failure is predominantly a disease of the elderly: at the age of 70 years, almost half of all patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure. Hypertension and obesity are common underlying disorders in patients with diastolic heart failure. Patients with diastolic heart failure have an equal, or only slightly better, prognosis in terms of mortality compared to patients with systolic heart failure. Echocardiography can distinguish diastolic heart failure from systolic heart failure. Patients with heart failure and a normal ejection fraction almost certainly have a diastolic dysfunction. There is a lack of reliable data about the optimal medicinal treatment strategy for patients with diastolic heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and (non-dihydropyridine) calcium antagonists have therapeutic potential. Digoxin may be contraindicated.", 
    "38": "We hypothesized that resistance arteries from diabetic patients with controlled hypertension have less remodeling than vessels from untreated hypertensive subjects. Eight normotensive subjects (aged 44+/-3 years, 3 men; values are mean+/-SEM), 19 untreated hypertensive subjects (46+/-2 years, 9 men), and 23 hypertensive subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus under antihypertensive treatment (58+/-1 years, 15 men) were studied. Resistance arteries dissected from gluteal subcutaneous tissue were assessed on a pressurized myograph. Most diabetic patients (70%) were being treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although systolic blood pressure was still above the normotensive range in these patients (144+/-2 versus 150+/-3 mm Hg in hypertensive and 114+/-4 mm Hg in normotensive subjects), diastolic blood pressure was well controlled (83+/-2 mm Hg) and significantly lower compared with that in untreated hypertensives (100+/-1 mm Hg; P<0.001) but higher than in normotensives (76+/-3 mm Hg; P<0.05). Thus, pulse pressure was higher in diabetic patients (P<0.05). The media-to-lumen ratio of resistance arteries was greater in hypertensives (0.083+/-0.002) compared with normotensive controls (0.059+/-0.003; P<0.05) and was even higher in diabetic hypertensive subjects (0.105+/-0.004; P<0.001 versus normotensive controls). The medial cross-sectional area was greater in diabetic and hypertensive patients compared with normotensive controls (P<0.001). Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was impaired in vessels from hypertensive patients and from patients with both diabetes mellitus and hypertension (P<0.05 versus normotensive controls), whereas endothelium-independent vasorelaxation was similar in all groups. Despite effective antihypertensive treatment, resistance arteries from hypertensive diabetic patients showed marked remodeling, greater than that of vessels from untreated, nondiabetic, hypertensive subjects, in agreement with the high cardiovascular risk of subjects suffering from both diabetes and hypertension.",

Pertinent articles cited in the identified papers were also reviewed. We included prospective randomized studies of more than 12 months' duration that evaluated the effect of drug treatment on morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension. We estimated the effect of treatment with calcium antagonists on morbidity and mortality in comparison with placebo, conventional therapy, and therapy that blocks the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "41": "We identified 14 studies that reported outcomes in diabetic hypertensive patients. Compared with placebo, calcium antagonists reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Compared with conventional therapy, calcium antagonists had similar effects on coronary heart disease and total mortality, but may have reduced the risk of stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74 to 1.02; P = 0.08). However, they resulted in a lesser reduction of the risk of heart failure (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.50). Calcium antagonists were less effective than blockers of the renin-angiotensin system in preventing heart failure (OR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.84), but had similar effects on stroke, coronary heart disease, and total mortality.",

    "43": "We investigated the renal structural and functional consequences of nitric oxide (NO) deficiency co-treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) in 20 adult male Wistar rats and 20 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The animals were separated into eight groups (n = 5) and treated for 30 days: Control, L-NAME (NO deficient group), Enalapril, L-NAME + Enalapril. The elevated blood pressure in NO deficient rats was partially reduced by enalapril. Serum creatinine was elevated in L-NAME-SHRs and effectively treated with enalapril. The proteinuria was significantly higher only in L-NAME-SHRs, and this was reduced by treatment with ACEi. The glomerular volume density (Vv(gl)) in L-NAME rats, both Wistar and SHR, was greater than in matched control rats, and enalapril treatment effectively prevented this Vv(gl) increase. No significant differences were observed in tubular volume density, Vv(tub), or tubular surface density, Sv(tub), in all Wistar groups. The Vv(tub) was smaller in L-NAME-SHRs than in control SHRs, and this tubular alteration was not prevented by enalapril. The Sv(tub) was not different among the SHR groups. In Wistar rats no changes were seen in vascular surface density, but a greatly increased cortical vascular volume density was seen in the enalapril treated rats. The vascular length density was greatly diminished in NO deficient rats that was effectively prevented with enalapril treatment. The vascular cortical renal stereological indices are normally reduced in SHRs. Administration of enalapril, but not L-NAME, changed this tendency. However, enalapril was not totally effective in preventing vascular damage in SHR NO deficient animals.", 
    "44": "Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in North America. Primary prevention of stroke includes lifestyle modifications and measures to control blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation. Lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension prevents both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke (relative risk reduction, 35 to 45 percent). Observational studies suggest that higher cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, and treatment with statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) may reduce the risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke by 25 percent. Although high-quality evidence linking tighter glucose control with stroke reduction is lacking, good glucose control and aggressive treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in patients with diabetes mellitus are recommended. The risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and the role of anticoagulation depend on factors such as age and the presence of comorbid conditions. Controversy exists about the roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aspirin in the primary prevention of stroke.", 
    "45": "Patients with diabetes are at high risk for the development of coronary artery disease and have a significantly impaired prognosis after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as compared with non-diabetic patients. The beneficial effect of pharmaceutical treatment for secondary prevention after STEMI is proven also for diabetics, but little is known about its use in clinical practice. Between June 1994 and December 2000, consecutive patients with STEMI, admitted to hospital within 24 h of symptoms onset, were enrolled into the multicenter MITRA registry in 61 hospitals in Germany. We examined whether there were differences in the frequencies of pharmaceutical secondary prevention after STEMI and in long-term outcomes between diabetics and nondiabetics in 8206 patients who had been discharged alive and followed for a mean period of 17 months. The prevalence of diabetes in 8206 patients discharged alive after acute STEMI was 18%. Diabetics were older and more often female, and more often already had prior myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke than non-diabetics. As chronic discharge medication, diabetics received aspirin and betablockers less often, but more often ACE inhibitors than non-diabetics. The mortality rate 17 months after STEMI was nearly twice as high in diabetics than in non-diabetics (19.1% vs. 10.4%, p<0.01 at univariate analysis; OR=1.50 and 95% CI 1.27-1.77 at multivariate analysis). The combined endpoint of death, MI and stroke occurred in 25.8% of diabetics, but only in 15.8% of non-diabetics ( p<0.01). Long-term treatment with aspirin, betablockers and ACE inhibitors in diabetics was associated with a significant reduction of mortality. Diabetics received intensive pharmaceutical therapy for secondary prevention significantly less often than non-diabetics, although the beneficial effects of this treatment were similar or even more pronounced as compared with non-diabetics. Diabetes was an independent predictor of increased mortality in follow-up after acute STEMI. Intensifying secondary prevention by a more frequent use of established pharmaceutical regimes might improve the prognosis of diabetics after STEMI and prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.", 
    "46": "Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that the pathways by which hypertension and dyslipidemia lead to vascular disease may overlap and that angiotensin II (Ang II) is involved in restructuring of the arterial wall in both atherosclerosis and hypertension. Ang II represents a potent proinflammatory agent promoting recruitment of monocytes into the vascular intima. Ang II also indirectly facilitates transformation of macrophages and smooth muscle cells into foam cells by promoting superoxide radical formation (via NADP/NADPH oxidase stimulation). The oxidative stress produced by Ang II leads to enhanced low-density lipoprotein oxidation and degradation of nitric oxide, an important vascular protective molecule capable of retarding atherosclerosis progression. The importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in atherogenesis is highlighted by studies in animal models as well as human beings indicating that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme or blockade of type 1 Ang II receptors retards the development of atherosclerotic lesions. In light of a causal and central role of Ang II in atherogenesis, blockade of the RAS represents an important therapeutic consideration in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic disease.", 
    "47": "Growing numbers of morbidity and mortality due to the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is recognized as the more increasing challenge in the world. The initial stage of atherosclerosis, early diagnosis and treatment of CHD are the main objectives of current research. Endothelium dysfunction, the earliest expression of the atherosclerotic process is associated with subtle biochemical changes that gradually are transformed into the structural changes of the arterial wall. The theory of free radicals is the most common among the atherosclerosis explanations. Overproduction or impaired neutralization of the free radicals accounts for oxidative stress that is causing substantial damage to the low density lipoproteins, nitric oxyde (NO), endothelium cells, tissue cells and finally leads to the endothelium dysfuction. Pathophysiology of oxidative stress and its role in the endothelium dysfunction are discussed in this paper. Positive role of various medications (statins, angiotensin converting enzym inhibitors, aldosteron antagonists, estrogens, antioxidants, b-blockers with vasodilatative properties) to the oxidative stress and consequently to the endothelium dysfuction are discussed as well.", 
    "48": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether atorvastatin, a powerful agent for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, influences ACE production in endothelial cells. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were treated with VEGF (476 pM), which induced ACE upregulation. Cotreatment with atorvastatin (0.1-10 microM) dose dependently inhibited VEGF-induced ACE upregulation. In the presence of mevalonate (100 microM), atorvastatin failed to downregulate VEGF-induced ACE production. Cotreatment of the cells with either farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP; 5 microM) or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP; 5 microM) partially inhibited the suppressive effect of atorvastatin. Pretreatment of the cells with Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 (10 microM), partially inhibited VEGF-induced ACE upregulation. VEGF (476 pM) caused PKC phosphorylation, which was inhibited by cotreatment of the cells with atorvastatin. Atorvastatin inhibited VEGF-induced ACE upregulation probably by inhibiting PKC phosphorylation. This effect was mediated via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. ACE downregulation may be an additional beneficial effect of statins in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "49": "The effects of bradykinin were evaluated using the ACE inhibitor enalapril and the APP inhibitor, 2-mercaptoethanol alone and in combination in rats with experimental myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction was produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Infarct size was measured by the TTC stain method. Lipid peroxide levels in serum and heart tissue were estimated by the methods developed by Yagi and Ohkawa et al., respectively. A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored throughout the experiment. With the combined inhibition of both the enzymes ACE and APP, a better cardioprotection was observed when compared to individual inhibition of the enzymes, suggesting the involvement of bradykinin during experimental myocardial infarction.", 
    "50": "The aim of this study was to explore and compare initial treatment effects of captopril (Tensiomin) and sodium dimercaptosulphonate (DMPS) on a relatively large series of Wilson's disease inpatients. Two important markers of anticopper efficacy: serum sulphydryl and 24 h urinary copper levels in the patients were evaluated before and after treatment. The patients were randomly subdivided into 4 groups to allow statistical analysis (ANOVA) of the values recorded. The protocol was an open-label study of all the patients treated for 8 weeks (i.e., all the patients except those in the no-drug group), and a further six-month follow-up (post hospitalization) of the 14 patients administered captopril. Several copper-related variables were studied to evaluate the effect of the drugs on copper, and several biochemical and clinical variables were studied to evaluate potential toxic effects. Captopril was found to have a significant anticopper effect and did not markedly raise serum sulphydryl levels within this limited patient sample; the anticopper efficacy of captopril was, however, found to be markedly lower than that of DMPS; DMPS was found to raise the patients' serum sulphydryl and urinary copper levels. Evaluation of data from individual patients revealed evidence of a toxic side effect in only 1 patient, treated with DMPS, who exhibited transiently raised serum alanine aminotransferases, while no serious adverse events, upstanding syncope, irritating cough and leukopenia induced by captopril were noted. The results obtained in this four-group sample suggest that captopril might be a mild anticopper agent for Wilson's disease, possibly relieving the hepatic portal hypertension, but that DMPS has a greater field of anticopper efficiency than captopril. The authors also discuss recent experience of the overall treatment in China.", 
    "51": "Occlusion of the artery of organs results in ischaemia. The opening of occluded artery results in tissue lesion identified as reperfusion injury (RI). Renin-angiotensin system seems to be involved in the RI. In this study we assessed the effects of different doses of two inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (captopril or enalapril) and an angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker (losartan) in the RI of the kidney of rats. Female rats of 200-250 g were anaesthetized and used for RI studies. Different doses of captopril (5, 20 and 80 mg/kg), enalapril (1, 4 and 16 mg/kg) and/or losartan (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) were used (s.c.) 120 min prior to the initiation of RI. Kidneys were removed and checked histologically for the presence and the grading of ischaemic injury. Appropriate controls were used as well, RI produced lesions comparable with that of ischaemia. Different doses of captopril or enalapril prevented these lesions. This is suggestive of the involvement of renin-angiotensin system in the RI. Different doses of losartan failed to prevent RI lesions which suggest that the effect of captopril or enalapril are not mediated through the AT1 receptors. Further studies on the involvement of AT2 receptor or other independent mechanisms are suggested.",

    "53": "Allylmercaptocaptopril (CPSSA) was synthesized by reacting captopril with pure allicin. Fructose-induced hypertensive groups of rats were fed a fructose-rich diet for 3 weeks, and then received the diet plus either CPSSA (40 to 56 mg or 138 to 194 micromol/L/kg/d) or captopril (80 mg or 369 micromol/L/kg/d) for 2 more weeks. CPSSA (both doses) significantly lowered blood pressure (BP) from 153.4 to 120.8 mm Hg (P <.005). Captopril gave similar results, lowering BP from 150.7 to 123 mm Hg (P <.005). CPSSA also decreased the high levels of triglycerides to normal. The new stable compound allylmercaptocaptopril combines the beneficial properties of captopril and allicin and is a potential candidate for antihypertensive drug therapy.",

Diastolic dysfunction is an early poor prognostic factor in hypertension and is a reversible condition. Early detection and treatment is necessary to avoid cardiac complications. The objective of this study was to assess the occurrence of diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients referred for echocardiograph assessment of left ventricular function in a secondary hospital. It was also designed to determine whether contributing factors such as age, gender, systolic and diastolic pressure, duration of hypertension, previous myocardial infarct or ischemic heart disease and choice of anti-hypertensive drugs influence the development of diastolic dysfunction in these hypertensive patients. The analysis of diastolic dysfunction was based on the E/A ratio using Doppler echocardiogram. All of the patients were recruited from the Echocardiography Unit, Department of Medicine, Seremban General Hospital. Fifty patients with history of hypertension were selected for the study. Out of These 22 patients (44%) were found to have diastolic dysfunction; 39.1% of male patients (9 out of 23) and 48.1% of female patients (13 out of 27).

Two men and one woman of age 67, 53, and 54 years, who maintained functional cadaveric graft for 17, 9, and 13 years, and had diagnosed significant renal transplant artery stenosis at 2, 1, and 2 years after renal transplantation, respectively, were studied. Stenoses were diagnosed angiographically in the first patient and by Doppler in other two patients, then confirmed by angiography. All three patients had difficult-to-treat hypertension with deterioration of graft function in the presence of or after introducing ACE-inhibitor therapy. PTA was performed in all patients with suboptimal or unsuccessful results as assessed by angiography or control Doppler examination--the residual stenosis was significant and practically unchanged. Surgery was not performed because of high risk, so patients were further treated conservatively. Hypertension was treated avoiding ACE inhibitors. Twelve, 7, and 7 years after angioplasty the serum creatinine is stable in all patients, even decreased compared to pre-PTA and early post-PTA levels, namely, 134, 102, and 75 micromol/L, respectively. Control Doppler examinations revealed a residual stenotic jet in all patients, with slightly decreased peak systolic velocity over time, indicating a slightly decreased grade of stenosis. These observations suggest that renal transplant artery stenosis, even of high grade, can be stable, or even regress with time with excellent long-term graft survival.

The most common reasons for exclusion were renal insufficiency, cough, and baseline hypotension. Changes in potassium level, serum creatinine level, and blood pressure were not significant during the study.",

    "78": "High blood pressure is common in the western world and is a major risk factor for the development of stroke. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of first and recurrent stroke. High blood pressure is also common in acute stroke and is independently associated with a poor prognosis, in part due to promoting early recurrence and the development of fatal cerebral oedema in patients with ischaemic stroke and, possibly, re-bleeding in those with haemorrhagic stroke. However, the management of blood pressure remains an enigma--its lowering could improve outcome by reducing recurrence or worsen outcome by reducing regional perfusion in the face of dysfunctional cerebral autoregulation. Conversely, raising blood pressure might improve outcome by raising regional perfusion or worsen it by inducing cerebral oedema and early recurrence. Administration of some vaso-active drugs (beta-receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers) can worsen outcome and reduce cerebral blood flow. In contrast, other drug classes--angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists and nitrates--appear to lower blood pressure without reducing measures of cerebral perfusion. In the absence of definitive trial data, which is urgently needed, blood pressure should not be routinely lowered unless it is extreme (systolic blood pressure >220 mm Hg) or associated with arterial dissection or cardiac ischaemia or failure, in which case cautious lowering (<15%), perhaps with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist or nitrate, is appropriate.", 
    "79": "Proteinuria plays a causal role in the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). A previous controlled trial showed that steroids are effective in reducing proteinuria and preserving renal function in patients with IgAN. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of steroids in IgAN, examine the trend of proteinuria during follow-up (starting from the hypothesis that the degree of reduction in proteinuria may influence IgAN outcome), and evaluate how histologic scores can influence steroid response. A secondary analysis of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of 86 adult IgAN patients who were receiving supportive therapy or intravenous methylprednisolone plus oral prednisone for 6 mo was conducted. Ten-year renal survival was significantly better in the steroid than in the control group (97% versus 53%; log rank test P = 0.0003). In the 72 patients who did not reach the end point (doubling in baseline serum creatinine), median proteinuria significantly decreased (1.9 g/24 h at baseline, 1.1 g/24 h after 6 mo, and 0.6 g/24 h after a median of 7 yr). In the 14 progressive patients, proteinuria increased from a median of 1.7 g/24 h at baseline to 2.0 g/24 h after 6 mo and 3.3 g/24 h after a median of 5 yr. Steroids were effective in every histologic class. Cox multivariate regression analyses showed that, in addition to steroids, a low baseline histologic score, a reduction in proteinuria after 6 mo, and no increase in proteinuria during follow-up all were independent predictors of a beneficial outcome. Steroids significantly reduce proteinuria and protect against renal function deterioration in IgAN. The histologic picture and proteinuria during early and late follow-up improve the prediction of outcome, but considerable variability remains outside the model.", 
    "80": "Structural and functional changes occur in the kidney with aging. Previous studies have suggested that loss of nitric oxide production contributes to these changes. The authors therefore explored regulation of renal cortical oxygen consumption, a nitric oxide mediated effect, in tissue from Fischer 344 rats at different ages (4, 13, and 23 mo) to characterize changes in renal nitric oxide production with age. Bradykinin, enalaprilat, and amlodipine significantly suppressed cortical oxygen consumption in 4-mo-old rats (bradykinin: -2.5 +/- 0.9% to -21 +/- 1.5%; enalaprilat: -0.7 +/- 0.5% to -26 +/- 1.2%; amlodipine: -1.3 +/- 0.9% to -18 +/- 1.2%; P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained in 13-mo-old animals. However, in 23-mo-old animals, the responses to bradykinin and enalaprilat were attenuated (bradykinin: 0 +/- 0% to -13 +/- 0.9%; enalaprilat: -0.3 +/- 0.3% to -17 +/- 2.1%; P < 0.05), whereas the response to an NO donor was unaffected, suggesting decreased bioavailability of NO. Addition of the superoxide radical scavenger tempol restored the ability of bradykinin, enalaprilat, and amlodipine to suppress oxygen consumption in tissue from 23-mo-old animals to levels seen in younger animals, suggesting NO destruction by superoxide as the reason for decreased NO availability. Apocynin, an inhibitor of NAD(P)H oxidase, similarly restored the ability of all three drugs to suppress oxygen consumption, suggesting NAD(P)H oxidase as the enzyme responsible for enhanced superoxide production in aging. Levels of eNOS protein, assessed by immunoblotting, did not change significantly with age. These results suggest that NO availability is decreased in the aging kidney and that this is due to scavenging of NO by superoxide produced by NAD(P)H oxidase. Oxidant stress, by depleting NO, may contribute to the structural and hemodynamic changes characteristic of the aging kidney.", 
    "81": "Single ventricular myocytes were prepared from control db/+ and insulin-resistant diabetic db/db male mice at 6 and 12 weeks of age. Peak and sustained outward potassium currents were measured using whole-cell voltage clamp methods. At 6 weeks currents were fully developed in control and diabetic mice, with no differences in the density of either current. By 12 weeks both currents were significantly attenuated in the diabetic mice, but could be augmented by in vitro incubation with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril (1 microM, 5-9 h). In cells from female db/db mice (12 weeks of age), K(+) currents were not attenuated and no effects of quinapril were observed. To investigate whether lack of insulin action accounts for these gender differences, cells were also isolated from cardiomyocyte-specific insulin receptor knockout (CIRKO) mice. Both K(+) currents were significantly attenuated in cells from male and female CIRKO mice, and action potentials were significantly prolonged. Incubation with quinapril did not augment K(+) currents. Our results demonstrate that type 2 diabetes is associated with gender-selective attenuation of K(+) currents in cardiomyocytes, which may underlie gender differences in the development of some cardiac arrhythmias. The mechanism for attenuation of K(+) currents in cells from male mice is due, at least in part, to an autocrine effect resulting from activation of a cardiac renin-angiotensin system. Insulin is not involved in these gender differences, since the absence of insulin action in CIRKO mice diminishes K(+) currents in cells from both males and females.",

In total, 595 patients were classified as having hypertension, of whom 192 received no treatment (32%), 193 received an ACE inhibitor (32%), and 210 received other antihypertensives. Patients visiting a diabetes facility, referred to a specialist, with a female general practitioner, or with a general practitioner with </=10 years work experience had better recordings of their blood pressure. Suboptimal treatment was higher in older patients and smoking patients. Treatment was better in patients with coronary comorbidity, hyperlipidemia, or those referred to a specialist. Not achieving the blood pressure target was related to older age of the patients.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor blockers have been shown to effectively reduce blood pressure, protect the kidney, and reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Therefore, there is increased interest in the effects of aldosterone and the use of aldosterone-receptor antagonists in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Eplerenone is the first selective aldosterone-receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of hypertension and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).",

In the largest trial to date (ALLHAT), thiazide-type diuretic was found to offer advantages over newer drugs. The medical community should now be capable of reaching consensus, and recommend thiazides as the first line therapy for the treatment of hypertension. Prescribing physicians, cardiologists, drug companies and health authorities are all partly responsible for the years of irrational prescribing that we have witnessed.",

    "94": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been observed with a variety of different peptides, and peptide fragments with inhibitory capabilities have been identified within many different proteins, including milk proteins. The purpose of this study therefore was to identify new short peptides with inhibitory properties from the primary structure of milk proteins and to characterize them in vitro and in vivo, since no milk derived ACE inhibitors have previously been evaluated for their ability to inhibit ACE in vivo. In vitro, 8 of 9 dipeptides were found to be competitive inhibitors of ACE. The IC50 was significantly lower when an angiotensin I-like substrate was used, than when a bradykinin-like substrate was used. Using three different in vivo models for ACE inhibition, a very moderate effect was observed for three of the new peptides, but only for up to 6 or 12 minutes. Nothing was observed with two reference compounds that are reported to be hypotensive ACE-inhibitors derived from milk proteins. This raises the question whether the mechanism of hypotensive action is straightforward inhibition of ACE in vivo.", 
    "95": "All four main studies of lifestyle intervention on diabetes incidence found a clear benefit for diet and exercise intervention compared with usual care. Although the study populations differed by race and ethnicity, the mean BMI, and the intensity of the lifestyle intervention provided, all investigators found substantial diabetes risk reduction with modest weight loss and increased physical activity. Results of these trials give health care providers useful and heartening information to share with patients at risk for diabetes. The challenge remains to find feasible and cost-efficient methods to identify people at risk and to deliver effective lifestyle interventions. Findings from trials of pharmacologic agents such as metformin, acarbose, and troglitazone are encouraging; however, the ADA recommends that drug therapy should not be used routinely to prevent diabetes until more information regarding the cost-effectiveness of such intervention is known [20]. Results from trials that found a lower incidence of diabetes among those randomly assigned to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, or hormone therapy are intriguing but must be viewed with caution because they are based on post hoc analyses. Because it is difficult to conduct randomized controlled trials of major operative procedures such as bariatric surgery, observational studies that compare surgical interventions for weight loss with traditional weight-loss management may be the best evidence available. These studies have the potential for healthy-person bias in that people who choose bariatric surgery may have other healthy behaviors that are often difficult to measure and control for; such behaviors could account for their lower incidence of diabetes. Undeniably, the best test to diagnose those at high risk for diabetes is not yet known. New strategies that identify those with pre-diabetes and that overcome the limitations of the current tests, particularly the 2-hour post-challenge glucose test, are needed.",

    "97": "We studied 27 patients with idiopathic or ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with LV severe systolic disfunction (ejection fraction <35%). Fourteen patients were randomized to receive carvedilol treatment (carvedilol group), and 13 patients continued to receive standard therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and vasodilators (placebo group). All patients underwent an echo-Doppler ultrasound scanning examination at the beginning of the study and after 4 and 12 months of treatment.",

These improvements were confirmed after 1 year of follow-up, whereas patients in the placebo group did not shown any significant modifications. After 1 year, the differences in these groups were more significant for A wave (39 +/- 4 cm/sec carvedilol group vs 30 +/- 4 cm/sec placebo group; P <.0001), for E/A ratio (1.8 +/- 0.2 carvedilol group vs 2.6 +/- 0.5 placebo group; P <.0002), for DT 1(40 +/- 16 msec carvedilol group vs 112 +/- 13 msec placebo group; P <.001), and for IVRT (74 +/- 8 msec carvedilol group vs 57 +/- 7 mesc placebo group; P <.0002). These changes seem to happen before systolic and morphological modifications.",

Further investigations with a greater sample size will be necessary to confirm our findings.",

This randomized controlled study examines whether exercise aggravates left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with extensive anterior AMI.",

Exercise intensity was determined by the heart rate of each patient at ventilatory threshold (VT). Three weeks after onset, a second LVG was performed, followed by a supervised exercise program at VT for 12 weeks. The LVG was reassessed after the exercise program. We then calculated the global LV volume (end-diastolic volume index [EDVI], end-systolic volume index [ESVI]) and systolic expansion volume index (SEVI), a new parameter for measuring the infarction site expansion at the end-systolic phase.",

    "104": "Inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis in heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI). N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) is a naturally occurring antifibrotic peptide whose plasma concentration is increased 4- to 5-fold by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We tested the hypothesis that in rats with HF after MI, Ac-SDKP acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, preventing and also reversing cardiac fibrosis in the noninfarcted area (reactive fibrosis), and thus affording functional improvement. We found that Ac-SDKP significantly decreased total collagen content in the prevention group from 23.7+/-0.9 to 15.0+/-0.7 microg/mg and in the reversal group from 22.6+/-2.2 to 14.4+/-1.6 (P<0.01). Interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen were likewise significantly reduced. We also found that infiltrating macrophages were reduced from 264.7+/-8.1 to 170.2+/-9.2/mm2, P<0.001 (prevention), and from 257.5+/-9.1 to 153.1+/-8.5 mm2, P<0.001 (reversal), while transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-positive cells were decreased from 195.6+/-8.4 to 129.6+/-5.7/mm2, P<0.01 (prevention), and from 195.6+/-8.4 to 130.7+/-10.8/mm2, P<0.01 (reversal). Ac-SDKP did not alter either blood pressure or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH); however, it depressed systolic cardiac function in the prevention study while having no significant effect in the reversal group. We concluded that Ac-SDKP has an anti-inflammatory effect in HF that may contribute to its antifibrotic effect; however, this decrease in fibrosis without changes in LVH was not accompanied by an improvement in cardiac function.",

    "109": "Disturbance of the normal mucociliary clearance due to hyperproduction of mucus and modification of its physicochemical characteristics is a common finding in airway diseases. Drugs that affect airway secretion have been developed and used to cleanse the respiratory tract for many centuries and in many countries. On the basis of the mechanism of their actions, the mucoactive drugs are classified into several groups. Some mucoactive drugs have direct effects on the production or composition of airway secretions, resulting in increased effectiveness of mucociliary clearance. Other mucoactive drugs do not have a specific action on mucus, but have beneficial effects on airway structure and function, which lead to correction of the pathophysiologic mechanisms that result in abnormal secretions. However, since many drugs have overlapping effects, it is difficult to classify these drugs into groups based on their major actions. Taken together with previous findings on mucoactive drugs, it appears that an antioxidant effect is a common property of mucoactive drugs and that it is a crucial action to exert their effects against airway diseases. In light of this idea, we must use specific experimental models to simulate pharmacologic events in airway inflammation. The development of new techniques has made it possible to identify and measure the mucus components, measure the rheologic parameters more accurately, and evaluate mucociliary clearance precisely in animals and humans. Therefore, with modifications of methods, we have investigated airway-cleansing drugs from various points of view to reflect actions in inflammatory states for more than two decades. Here, I introduce the methods we have used to study many of the parameters involved in airway clearance, including cough reflex, and describe some of the mucoactive-antitussive drugs that we have studied recently. There is an increasing usage of traditional Chinese herbal medicines in clinics and hospitals, because they tend to have moderate side effects and sometimes remarkable efficacy. To renormalize overall defects in airway disorders, Chinese medicines may be adequate, because they are composed of various herbs with weak but ubiquitous pharmacologic activities. We have been investigating Bakumondo-to. Bakumondo-to has been used for the treatment of bronchitis and pharyngitis accompanying severe dry cough. We found that unlike codeine Bakumondo-to had a notable antitussive activity against the cough associated with bronchitis and the cough increased by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Recently, we have found that, in alveolar type II cells, Bakumondo-to attenuated phosphatidylcholine secretion increased by oxygen radicals from activated PMNLS. In addition, we found that Bakumondo-to itself stimulated phosphatidylcholine secretion and increased beta-adrenoceptor gene expression in rat alveolar type II cells. We studied the mechanism of action and clarified that Bakumondo-to increased glucocorticoid-sensitive promotor activity. The effect may contribute to its ubiquitous effectiveness in the treatment of airway diseases. Various parameters (chemical properties, physical properties, mucus production, surfactant phospholipid production, and mucociliary clearance) are considered to be important for the dynamics and mobilization of airway secretions. Pharmacologic investigation, with appropriate techniques, of the ability of an agent to modify these parameters can provide useful information about its mechanism of action. However, since these parameters are interconnected, it is very complicated to elucidate the precise mechanisms of action of mucoactive drugs. This means that the goal of treatment cannot always be achieved by the modification of a single parameter, but should, more realistically, be aimed at a renormalization of several parameters. On the basis of this idea, glucocorticoids are ideal mucoactive drugs because they exert various pharmacologic effects in the lung. From a polypharmacologic point of view, a traditional Chinese medicine can be classified as a glucocorticoid-like drug because Chinese medicines consist of many types of active components that have various pharmacologic effects. As one future course of research, we believe that efforts to seek compatible actions between glucocorticoids and Oriental medicines may lead to new opportunities for development of ideal airway-cleansing drugs with specific actions, i.e., suppression of gene expression.",

Hemodynamic parameters were recorded by M- and B-mode and Doppler echocardiography. The gaseous composition of blood was studied by the Astrup micromethod; the rheological properties of venous blood were explored by an AKP-2 rotational viscometer. According to their therapy, the examinees were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 included 18 patients given prestarium (Servier, France) in a dose of 2-4 mg/day. Group 2 (a control group) comprised 14 patients receiving the basal therapy provided by the medical and economical standards of therapy for COB. The studies have indicated that the inclusion of prestarium into the combined treatment of COB patients with FC IV PH promotes a significant improvement of the clinical status of patients, causes a reduction in the size of the right atrium (by 16.2%; p < 0.05) and the right ventricle (by 12.4%; p < 0.001), a 12.0%-fold increase in left ventricular ejection fraction. The drug produced no negative effect on ERF and blood gaseous composition and rheological properties. Therefore, a course and long-term use of prestarium in the combined therapy of COB patients with FC IV PH leads to clinical improvement, to correction of basic cardiohemodynamic parameters, and exerts a remodeling effect on the right and left ventricles, and improves life quality in patients.",

In high VAP, its night values are subnormal while daytime values are high in patients on combined medication and hypoxic therapy. The patients on standard medication had significantly low VAP at night while their daytime VAP tended to decrease. VAP positively correlated with hypertensive load. In high VAP hypoxic and drug therapies are less effective.",

Clinical condition of the patients was stabilized by the conventional therapy including ACE inhibitor--enalapril in a dose 10-20 mg/day. In 3 weeks this therapy was combined with losartan in a dose 25-50 mg/day. The course of treatment was 48 weeks. Cardiodynamics was assessed by duplex echocardiography and dopplerography. Plasmic concentrations of atrial sodiumuretic peptide (ASUP), renin, angiotensin-II, aldosteron, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, hydrocortisone, endothelin-1 were measured with radioimmunoassay. In the study group there were 31 deaths for 48 weeks. ASUP concentration in the deceased was significantly higher than in the survivors (n = 141). The stepwise regression analysis discovered correlation between plasmic ASUP and end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle (r = 0.62; p = 0.01), dopplerographic index (r = 0.52; p = 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.66; p = 0.002), velocity of early diastolic filling (r = -0.84; p = 0.001), plasmic pool of norepinephrine (r = 0.66; p = 0.001), endotheline-1 (r = 0.70; p = 0.03) and angiotensin-II (r = 0.55; p = 0.02), daily dose of furosemide (r = 0.80; p = 0.001), heart rate (r = 0.64; p = 0.02). The strongest negative effect on CF patients' survival was linked with plasmic content of ASUP (relative risk = 4.55), angiotensin-II (RR = 3.2), ejection fraction < 25% (RR = 3.02). Thus, elevation of ASUP in blood plasm can be regarded a marker of a high cardiovascular risk of CF patients treated with AT-antagonist.",

Cardiac index (CI), systolic BP, systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), RI and pulse wave stiffness index (SI) were all significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner by Ang II on placebo therapy. Telmisartan significantly (p<0.05) attenuated all of these responses to Ang II. Increases in BP during Ang II infusion were associated with increases in SVRI and CI.", 
    "117": "Telmisartan effectively blocked the effects of intravenous Ang II on CI, BP, RI and SI in healthy volunteers. Changes in CI make a major contribution to increase in BP response to intravenous Ang II in normal volunteers.", 
    "118": "The Telmisartan Effectiveness on Left ventricular MAss Reduction (TELMAR) trial will assess the effect of the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blocker, telmisartan, on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) compared with the b-blocker, metoprolol, at similar antihypertensive doses. The rationale is that antihypertensives reduce LVH, a cardiac adaptation to pressure overload, principally by pressure-related effects. Ang II plays a key role in pressure-independent mechanisms causing LVH, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors induce more pronounced LVH regression than some other antihypertensives. Blocking Ang II Type 1 receptors may be more effective than ACE inhibition in reducing LVH. TELMAR is a prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial. A total of 140 patients (age 18 80 years) with uncontrolled essential hypertension (mean daytime systolic blood pressure [SBP] >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >90 mmHg and/or night-time SBP >120 mmHg or DBP >70 mmHg, measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ABPM]) and left ventricular mass index related to height (LVMI) >0.8 g/cm for females, >1.1 g/cm for males (defined by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) will be randomised to once-daily telmisartan or metoprolol. The telmisartan dose will be 40 mg for the first two weeks, 80 mg for 5.5 months and 40 mg for the last two weeks. Metoprolol will be given at a dose of 47.5 mg for two weeks, 95 mg for 5.5 months and 47.5 mg for two weeks. Concomitant add-on medication with hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine will be allowed. The primary endpoint is the percentage change in LVMI at treatment end versus baseline, using MRI. Secondary variables include blood pressure changes and response rates assessed by ABPM and manual cuff sphygmomanometry, and end-systolic wall stress, systolic left ventricular function (LVF) and diastolic LVF determined by MRI. A separate study was performed prior to the main trial to define the normal range of MRI data in an age-matched population.", 
    "119": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)) antagonist treatment with reduced dietary sodium intake produces suppression of cardiac growth and regression of cardiac hypertrophy. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether cardiac growth suppression by combined RAS blockade under conditions of dietary sodium restriction is associated with cardiomyocyte atrophy and contractile dysfunction and whether this intervention modifies cardiomyocyte inotropic responsiveness to angiotensin II (Ang II).", 
    "120": "Rats were fed a high (4% w/w) or low (0.2% w/w) NaCl diet for six days. Both groups were then given a combined intraperitoneal injection of perindopril (6 mg/kg/day) and losartan (10 mg/kg/day) with maintained dietary treatment for another seven days. At the end of the treatment period, animals were anaesthetised and their hearts were removed and weighed. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and cell dimensions were evaluated. A line scan camera and digital imaging technique were used to assess cardiomyocyte contraction and inotropic responses to exogenous Ang II (10 to 10(-8) M).", 
    "121": "Dietary treatment alone had no effect on body growth, whereas combined RAS blockade suppressed somatic growth in the low sodium (LS) group, compared with the high sodium (HS) group. This growth suppression in the LS group was also evident in the heart at the organ and cellular level. Studies of cardiomyocyte contraction showed that myocytes from the LS group exhibited contractile instability and depression of contractile performance. Compared with the HS group, myocytes from the LS group showed a significant reduction in maximum cell shortening (6.40+0.17 vs. 7.32+0.16% resting length, p<0.05), and maximum rate of shortening (3.85+0.14 vs. 4.29+0.11 cell length/ms, p<0.05). Myocytes of the HS group exhibited negative inotropic responses to Ang II at all concentrations tested, with a significant reduction in maximum cell shortening by 11 16% after 12 minutes peptide exposure (p<0.05 vs. non-treated control). In comparison, Ang II elicited both positive and negative responses in myocytes from the LS group, with a predominant negative inotropic effect.", 
    "122": "This study provides evidence that combined RAS blockade treatment under restricted sodium intake conditions can impair cardiomyocyte contractile function in association with cardiomyocyte growth suppression. Chronic RAS blockade qualitatively alters the intrinsic inotropic status and responsiveness of ventricular cardiomyocytes, and this shift is further modulated by dietary sodium intake conditions.", 
    "123": "The EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) demonstrated that the angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, compared with placebo, in patients with established coronary artery disease, reduced cardiovascular endpoints by 20% over a four-year follow-up period. Although the authors of this study claim that the risk reduction was best explained by blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, reference to recent meta-analyses of blood pressure (BP)-lowering trials provides compelling evidence that the benefits observed in the trial could be explained by the 5/2 mmHg BP difference between active and placebo treatments.", 
    "124": "PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND THERAPY: Left ventricular hypertrophy represents an important factor determining the prognosis of hypertensive patients. Hypertrophy as identified by electrocardiography (Table 1) or echocardiography (Table 2) characterizes patients with a significantly increased risk of mortality and arrhythmia. From the pathophysiological point of view this is based on hypertrophy of the media in resistance vessels, on interstitial fibrosis, on a reduced coronary flow reserve and on the occurrence of ischemia (Figure 1). The diastolic and (later) systolic function of the heart are disturbed (Figures 2 to 4). Antihypertensive therapy with beta blockers and diuretics leads to a reduction of left ventricular mass by 5-8%, with ACE-inhibitors and AT-blockers by 13% (Figure 5). Particularly ACE-inhibitors can effectively reverse of the above mentioned pathological processes. Regression of hypertrophy goes along with an improved prognosis and a reduction of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (Figure 6). A symptomatic treatment of arrhythmias should always be accompanied by medical therapy aimed at regression of hypertrophy. Optimal therapy results in normalizes of blood pressure, leads to a regression of hypertrophy and induces cardiac reparation, which in turn improve left ventricular function, reduces microvascular ischemia stress and arrhythmias. These therapeutic desiderates are also pertinent for hypertensive heart disease in the prehypertrophic state, as in juvenile hypertension.", 
    "125": "In experimental arterial hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) becomes pathologic with impaired myocardial function if myocardial fibrosis occurs. Myocardial fibrosis is associated with activated circulating or local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. The primary objective of this retrospective study was to determine whether patients with arterial hypertension treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have less myocardial fibrosis than patients on non-ACEI treatment.",

Normal hearts designated for heart transplantation served as controls (n = 23; CTR). Myocyte diameter (MyoD) and collagen volume fraction (CVF) were measured by morphometry, and pro-matrix metalloproteinases (proMMPs) 2 and 9 by zymography. In a subset of 35 patients, LV myocardial stiffness was determined by left heart catheterization with calculation of stiffness constant k.", 
    "127": "In HTN + ACEI or HTN, MyoD (21.8 +/- 0.3 micro m and 22.4 +/- 0.3 micro m, respectively) and CVF (5.3 +/- 0.6% and 7.6 +/- 0.7%, respectively) were increased (p < 0.01) compared with CTR (16.0 +/- 0.4 micro m and 0.5 +/- 0.2%, respectively). In HTN + ACEI, CVF was significantly lower (p < 0.02) and proMMP 2 was higher (0.063 +/- 0.013 OD/mg) compared with HTN (0.037 +/- 0.006 OD/mg; p < 0.05) while no significant difference of MyoD was evident. We found no correlation between CVF and MyoD (r = 0.13; p = 0.47), a positive correlation between k and CVF (r = 0.71; p < 0.00001), and no correlation between k and MyoD (r = 0.22; p = 0.24).",

ACEI appear to diminish myocardial fibrosis associated with enhanced collagen degradation irrespective of LVH regression.", 
    "129": "The role of diuretics in the treatment of arterial hypertension remains a matter of controversy. On the basis of the results of recent studies and economic considerations a broader use of diuretics in the initial antihypertensive therapy has been proposed. The present review analyses two aspects of diuretics which are of interest in this debate. Thus, several studies demonstrate that diuretic therapy is associated with a greater incidence of new-onset diabetes as compared to calcium channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors and AT(1)-antagonists. The clinical relevance of this effect becomes clear when calculating the \"numbers needed to treat\" (NNT) on the basis of a long-term therapy over several decades. Based on the assumption of linear increases in the incidence of diabetes over time NNT then become remarkably small and in some studies number < 10. Another problem associated with diuretics is the low compliance and persistence with this type of drugs established in \"real life\" studies in which patients were not disciplined by the study design. These characteristics of diuretic therapy of hypertensive patients challenge the proposed medical and also economic benefit of diuretics as compared to more \"modern\" antihypertensive agents.",

    "131": "The efficacy of angiotensin (AT) II antagonists in lowering blood pressure was summarized in a meta-analysis including 43 trials and a total of 11,281 patients. The four AT II antagonist classes losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, and candesartan were studied and achieved a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure between 10.4 und 11.8 mmHg and in diastolic blood pressure between 8.2 und 8.9 mmHg. The effectiveness of AT II antagonist therapy in reducing clinical events such as stroke or end-stage renal disease in hypertension and associated conditions was shown in a number of large trials. Also, less adverse events were reported for AT II antagonist therapy compared to other antihypertensive medication such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, the number of trials is still comparatively small. Several ongoing trials will provide further insight into the effectiveness of AT II antagonist therapy.", 
    "132": "The efficiency of AT II antagonist therapy in being a cost-effective alternative for reducing clinical events in patients with hypertension requires further research. The combination of data from clinical trials with epidemiologic data about the natural history of the disease and factors such as patient compliance, side effects, acquisition costs or medication switch is needed to reflect costs in the \"real-world\" situation.", 
    "133": "Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke and vascular dementia. Antihypertensive treatment reduces stroke risk by 40%. Most probably, all antihypertensive drugs are equally effective with the exception of alpha blockers. One study showed superiority of an angiotensin (AT) II antagonist versus beta blocker in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Blood pressure is increased in many patients with acute stroke. In this phase, sudden drops in blood pressure should be avoided. All guidelines concerning antihypertensive treatment in acute stroke are not based on evidence. For secondary prevention, the combination of an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and diuretic reduced strokes by 28% after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a first stroke. Whether this is a drug-specific effect or due to lowering blood pressure per se is investigated at the moment. Antihypertensive treatment can reduce the incidence of vascular dementia and cognitive impairment.", 
    "134": "BACKGROUND AND THERAPY: The metabolic syndrome comprises a virulent and lethal group of atherosclerotic risk factors, including dyslipidemia, obesity, systemic hypertension and insulin resistance. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome has continuously grown in industrialized and developing countries during the last decades, and affects tens of millions of people in Germany and Europe. Particularly prominent as a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance is central obesity, which is causally involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in addition to genetic predisposition. The metabolic syndrome can easily be diagnosed in clinical practice (guidelines of the WHO and ATP III panel), and immediate treatment of the metabolic syndrome is mandatory because those patients are at increased risk to develop overt diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and stroke. The high risk for cardiovascular diseases is supported by findings that the risk for myocardial infarction in patients with insulin resistance is as high as the risk of patients after their first myocardial infarction. Intentional weight reduction reduces abdominal obesity and beneficially modulates all features of the metabolic syndrome, while the benefits of aerobic exercise training are discussed controversially. Thus, weight reduction causally undoes essential features of the metabolic syndrome, but effects are often not enduring. Therefore, the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dislipidemia is essential. Of note, antihypertensive treatment is more effective than tight glucose control to reduce cardiovascular events. Diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists are suggested as first line therapeutics. However, at least two antihypertensives are usually necessary to achieve the suggested goals of blood pressure reduction. In conclusion, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is continuously growing. Due to its adverse impact on cardiovascular disease, early detection and aggressive treatment is mandatory to ensure longlasting benefits for affected patients.",

After the initial evaluation, patients were treated using only nonpharmacological measures (n=23), only beta-blockers (n=26), only angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) (n=57) or a combination of treatments (n=25). The office blood pressure, biochemical profile and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were measured at the beginning and then yearly. The polymorphism A-6G of the AGT gene located in the promoter region was analysed.", 
    "137": "In total, 131 patients, 35 (27%) microalbuminurics, were included. Although no significant differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting glucose and UAE were observed among genotypes at the initial examination, during the 3 years of antihypertensive treatment the slope values for the DBP, fasting glucose and UAE differed significantly despite no differences in the distribution of treatments being present. The subjects carrying the AA-6 genotype had the largest DBP decrease, but the lowest UAE reduction and the highest slope of glucose. Out of 35 initially microalbuminuric patients, 24 became normoalbuminuric and the lowest reduction rates were observed in subjects who carried the allele A-6. No interaction between the type of treatment and genotype was observed on the changes in UAE, BP or glucose values. In the subset of 57 patients treated with ACEi, the changes in UAE, BP and glucose had the same trend as was observed in the total population.",

    "140": "Twenty-nine patients with hypertension who were highly suspect for having renal artery stenosis were included in the study. Basal captopril exercise renograms were performed within 1 week in all patients with Tc-99m EC. Exercise was performed with a bicycle ergometer as described in the literature. Interpretations of renograms were made according to the consensus report on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor renography as high, low, or intermediate probability. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were also obtained on both the kidneys and a patient basis. The results were compared with renal angiography in 19 patients.", 
    "141": "Twenty of 29 patients had concordant results with both captopril and exercise studies. All discordant tests were normal with captopril but positive with exercise renograms. Nineteen patients with 38 kidneys were included for statistical data analysis. Nine kidneys, which were either atrophic or abnormal during the basal study, were excluded from the kidney-based analysis. With contrast angiography, 8 patients had renal artery stenosis. When evaluated on a kidney basis, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for captopril scans were 87%, 100%, 100%, and 95%, and for the exercise scans were 100%, 90%, 80%, and 100% respectively. When calculated on a patient basis with regard to the captopril scans, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 87%, 81%, 77%, and 88%, and for exercise scans were 100%, 54%, 61%, and 100% respectively. There were 2 false-positive exercise scans that were found to be the result of dilated minor collecting systems and changes in kidney contours as a result of motion during exercise.", 
    "142": "These results indicate that exercise renography has a similar sensitivity but lower specificity compared with captopril scintigraphy in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. Because of the lower specificity, its use in the screening of renovascular hypertension may be limited. Exercise renography may be more useful as an investigative tool for essential hypertension.", 
    "143": "Adhering to medication regimens has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for persons with high blood pressure. A patient-related factor likely to affect adherence to treatment is the convenience of the prescribed drug regimen. The authors hypothesized that medication adherence would be superior and cost benefits would accrue in subjects who receive a once-daily, single-capsule, fixed-dose combination product for blood pressure control, compared with subjects who receive a similar regimen of separate components. A managed care organization that provides benefits for members enrolled in various health plans provided the data for this retrospective analysis. The database was used to assess medication adherence patterns for two groups of hypertensive subjects. Group 1 included subjects who had been prescribed the single-capsule, fixed-dose combination of amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl. Group 2 comprised subjects who had been prescribed a regimen including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker as separate drugs. Adherence was measured by the medication possession ratio, and medical resource utilization by the two groups was assessed during the study period. Group 1 (n=2754) and Group 2 (n=2978) were balanced with regard to age (mean, 53 years; range, 18-64 years) and sex (men, 50%; women, 50%). The overall medication possession ratio for Group 1 was significantly higher than that for Group 2 (80.8% vs. 73.8%; p<0.001). The average annual cost of cardiovascular-related care per subject was significantly lower in Group 1 compared with Group 2 (p<0.001). Subjects receiving the once-daily, single-capsule, fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril HCl demonstrated significantly better medication adherence and required fewer medical resources than did subjects receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker as separate components.", 
    "144": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are commonly prescribed for the management of hypertension. In addition, each of these drug classes has been shown to be effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure, proteinuric chronic kidney disease, and most recently the high-cardiac-risk profile patient. The individual success of each of these drug classes has fueled the theory that given together, the overall biologic effect of both would surpass that of either given alone. The foundation of this premise, although biologically plausible, has yet to be proven in a compelling enough fashion to support the everyday use of these two drug classes in combination. Additional clarifying studies are required to establish whether specific patient subsets exist that might benefit from such combination therapy.", 
    "145": "Hypertension is more prevalent and severe in African descendent populations living outside Africa than in any other population. Given this greater burden of hypertension in blacks, it is increasingly necessary to refine strategies to prevent the disorder as well as improve its treatment and control. This review assesses results from clinical trials on lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to identify which approaches most effectively prevent adverse hypertension-related outcomes in African descendent populations. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study provided evidence that a carefully controlled diet rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy foods, and reduced in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol (i.e., the DASH diet) reduces blood pressure in blacks and is well accepted. The combination of the DASH diet with reduction in dietary sodium below 100 mmol/d may provide a reduction in blood pressure beyond that reached by the DASH diet alone. Physical exercise and interventions to reduce psychological stress may also reduce blood pressure in blacks. Strong evidence from numerous studies is a compelling argument for continuing to recommend diuretics and beta blockers as first-line antihypertensive therapy for persons of all races. Some new studies also favor angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as first-line antihypertensive drugs. The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension provided evidence that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based treatment program is more beneficial than calcium channel blockers and beta blockers in reducing the progression of renal failure in blacks with hypertensive nephropathy. Studies in patients with diabetes have also shown evidence that both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists are more effective than other classes of antihypertensives in reducing adverse renal events. Studies to evaluate the effects of the new antihypertensives in improving outcomes in blacks living outside the United States are needed.", 
    "146": "The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) consisted of 42,418 participants randomized to one of four antihypertensive treatment groups: chlorthalidone, amlodipine, lisinopril, or doxazosin. A subset of these participants with fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels 100-189 mg/dL were randomized into a lipid-lowering component: 5170 to receive pravastatin (40 mg daily) and 5185 to receive usual care. This report describes the characteristics and lipid distribution of these participants. There were no important differences between the randomized treatment groups. Women had higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than men. There was a similar finding for black participants compared with whites, except blacks had lower triglycerides. Diabetics had lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglycerides than nondiabetics, and patients with body mass index <25 kg/m(2) had higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides than patients with higher body mass index. The success of the randomization of this large, diverse population and the differences in the lipid distributions among its subgroups will allow further understanding of optimal lipid-lowering treatment.", 
    "147": "Hypertension is the most common reason Americans visit a physician. Recent analyses from the Framingham Heart Study and others have shown that there will be 70 million hypertensive Americans by the year 2020 and that the overwhelming majority of hypertensives will be 65 years of age or older (what we used to call elderly). The lifetime risk of Americans who live to age 85 years of becoming hypertensive is approximately 90% for both men and women. These individuals, even if they develop an elevated blood pressure late in life, are at significantly increased risk of the many medical complications attributable to hypertension (coronary artery disease, strokes, heart failure, chronic renal disease, and more). Older hypertensives are more likely to have an elevated systolic blood pressure and a low diastolic blood pressure, both of which are related to a loss of article compliance and have an increase in left ventricular mass and a decrease in peripheral resistance. We now have a substantial body of evidence from well done clinical trials that older hypertensives benefit as much or more than younger patients from antihypertensive therapy, so there is no longer any justification for withholding medication from any hypertensive patient whose competing risk or other medical problems are not a contraindication to treatment. These same studies, and practice-based analyses, have shown that the major barrier to reaching blood pressure goal is our failure to reduce systolic blood pressure to <140 mm Hg in most patients and to <130 mm Hg in diabetics and those with renal failure. The basis for all antihypertensive therapy, especially in older people, is thiazide diuretics with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, or calcium entry blockers as appropriate add-on treatment. The choice of the second agent depends on other factors, such as comorbidity, lifestyle, and affordability. We must be more aggressive in getting the message out that older hypertensives benefit from treatment and we must overcome the clinical inertia that seems to be a factor in the decision of many physicians not to treat an older patient. No older person should suffer a preventable, life-threatening event or become confined to a wheel chair if attention to lifestyle issues and a few pills a day could avoid that outcome.",

Nevertheless, many physicians continue to favor more expensive medications like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers as first line agents. The persistent use of these agents raises questions as to whether physicians perceive ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers to be better than beta-blockers and diuretics.", 
    "153": "We surveyed 1,200 primary care physicians in 1997, and another 500 primary care physicians in 2000, and asked them to estimate the relative effectiveness and side effects of 4 classes of medication in treating a hypothetical patient with uncomplicated hypertension: ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. In addition, we asked them to indicate whether they ever provided free samples of hypertension medications to their patients.", 
    "154": "Perceptions of the relative effectiveness and side effects of the 4 classes of hypertension medications did not significantly change over the 3 years, nor did prescription recommendations. Physicians perceive that diuretics are less effective at lowering blood pressure than the other 3 classes (P <.001). They also perceive that beta-blockers are less tolerated than the other 3 classes (P <.001). In a multivariate model, perceptions of effectiveness and tolerability displayed significant associations with prescription preference independent of background variables. The only other variable to contribute significantly to the model was provision of free medication samples to patients.", 
    "155": "Despite numerous clinical trials showing no difference in the effectiveness or side-effect profiles of these 4 classes of drugs, most physicians believed that diuretics were less effective and beta-blockers were less tolerated than other medications. Moreover, their prescription practices were associated with their provision of free samples provided by pharmaceutical representatives, even after adjusting for other demographic characteristics. Efforts to increase physicians' prescribing of beta-blockers and diuretics may need to be directed at overcoming misunderstandings about the effectiveness and tolerability of these medicines.",

This review will evaluate the role of angiotensin II in the progression of renal damage in kidney diseases; the diagnostic value of microalbuminuria as an early clinical sign of renal damage and the possibility of preventing its further progression; the clinical results obtained with ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs in diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathies; and the therapeutic possibilities of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in renal transplantation. Based on available clinical data, ACE inhibitors can be considered to be the gold standard in reducing and/or preventing albuminuria, and thereby decreasing the percentage of patients who will progress to end-stage renal disease and death. Renal transplantation and chronic allograft nephropathy appear to be a promising field for the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs.",

After a 2-week washout period, 121 patients were randomly allocated to three different groups for 12 weeks. Medications were titrated upward as necessary to achieve the goal office-recorded sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) (defined as SiDBP <90 mmHg or SiDBP > or = 900 mmHg but with a > or = 10 mmHg drop from baseline). Efficacy and tolerability were assessed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy with each regimen. At 12 weeks, significant differences in SiDBP compared with data of baseline were noted in all three groups ( P < 0.001 in all comparisons). Similarly, significant differences in the sitting systolic blood pressure compared with baseline data were also seen for all three groups ( P < 0.001 in all comparisons). The number of patients reaching goal SiDBP were comparable for the three groups: 25 patients (62.5%) in the losartan group, 27 patients (67.5%) in the amlodipine group, and 22 patients (59.5%) in the lisinopril group (not significant). Amlodipine produced a more pronounced reduction in SiDBP than the other two medications, although without statistical significance. Patients receiving lisinopril showed a high incidence of coughing (31.7%). Low leg edema was noted only in the amlodipine group (7.5%). Compared with the amlodipine and lisinopril groups, the losartan group seemed to have relatively fewer episodes (7.5%), and fewer patients (three cases) experienced adverse effects.

Target blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension are levels < or = 140/90 mmHg. In patients with essential hypertension and concomitant diabetes mellitus type 2, blood pressure should be lowered to < or = 130/80 mmHg. Diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enyzme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin I (AT(1)) antagonists may nowadays be regarded as drugs of first choice in the treatment of essential hypertension. The Joint National Committee in the USA recommends to start treatment with a thiazide diuretic. A Guidelines Committee of European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology considers the Endgroups of drugs mentioned above to be equally suitable for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive therapy. Both groups of experts agree that in the majority of patients with essential hypertension, a combination of two or more drugs is required to reach target blood pressure. Both groups of experts emphasize that the main benefits of antihypertensive therapy are due to decreasing blood pressure per se.", 
    "159": "The development of pharmacologic agents that directly inhibit the angiotensin II receptor (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) has provided clinicians with an alternative to the previously available angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) to downregulate the renin-angiotensin system. This review focuses on the available data that can guide the clinician to the use of these two classes of agents vis \u00e0 vis their ability to provide cardiovascular (CV) and renal protection. Although the CV protective effect of ACEI in high-risk populations is widely appreciated, whether such an effect is entirely BP independent can be questioned. Most head-to-head comparisons between ACEI and ARB have yielded comparable CV protective effects, with ARB being associated with fewer adverse effects. Likewise, several-but not all-studies have demonstrated a CV protective effect of ACEI when compared with other active agents in patients with type 2 diabetes. One study demonstrated a similar protection with ARB when compared with a beta blocker. In terms of renal protection, there are ample data to support a role for both ACEI and ARB to prevent the progression from microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, when progression of renal disease is used as an end point, protection has been demonstrated with ACEI only for type 1 but not type 2 diabetes. In this latter group, only ARB have been shown to slow progression to ESRD.", 
    "160": "Chronic renal disease is characterized by a gradual loss of renal function and an increased cardiovascular risk. Renin-angiotensin system blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade has distinct renoprotective and cardiovascular protective effects, but which of the two drug classes confers more protection is still a matter of debate. This review highlights and compares the effects of the two drug-classes in nondiabetic renal disease and in overt or incipient nephropathy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both renal and cardiovascular outcomes are considered. Regardless of their relative efficacy, both drug classes have a dose-response relationship for intermediate renal and cardiovascular parameters. Moreover, combined treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade seems to provide better long-term renoprotection than monotherapy. Actually, in most patients, achieving maximal renal and cardiovascular protection requires a multidrug regimen, usually including several antihypertensives. Within this approach, full dose titration of either RAS blocker followed by add-on with the second drug is more important than the choice of the initial drug.", 
    "161": "Hypertension, impaired renal function, and proteinuria are commonly associated to the presence of diabetes. They play a major role in the development of cardiovascular and renal damage. Effective antihypertensive treatment reduces the progression of diabetic nephropathy and improves cardiovascular prognosis. Accordingly, tight BP control (<130/80 mmHg) is currently recommended in diabetic patients. Achieving BP targets represents the most important determinant of cardiovascular and renal protection. However, it has been suggested that specific classes of antihypertensive drugs may exert additional organ protection beyond their BP control. The pharmacologic blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been shown to convey greater renal and cardiovascular protection compared with other classes of drugs. In particular, studies focusing on renal end point suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are the first-choice drugs in type 1 diabetes. Both ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers prevent the progression from microalbuminuria to clinical proteinuria in type 2 diabetes, but angiotensin blockers provide better renoprotection in patients with overt nephropathy. Regarding cardiovascular protection, several studies (but not all) have shown that ACEI exert a protective effect on diabetic patients. Recently, interesting results in favor of angiotensin receptor blockers have been reported in the IDNT, RENAAL, and LIFE studies. It should be noted that to achieve maximal renal and cardiovascular protection, most diabetic patients require integrated therapeutic intervention, including not only several antihypertensive drugs, but statins and antiplatelet therapy as well.",

To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the reaction of mushroom tyrosinase with tyrosyl radical generated by horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide. Resting tyrosinase, which contained a small amount of oxytyrosinase, did not oxidize tyrosine to DOPAchrome until horseradish peroxidase exhausted H(2)O(2) and thereafter the enzyme recovered its full activity. During the inhibition period most tyrosine was converted to dityrosine, suggesting that only a small amount of tyrosyl radical was enough to interact with a fraction of tyrosinase which was in the active oxy-form. When horseradish peroxidase and H(2)O(2) were added to oxytyrosinase, which was prepared by allowing it to turn over beforehand, DOPAchrome production was abolished with an accelerated consumption of H(2)O(2). Dityrosine formation was totally suppressed and tyrosine concentration stayed constant during the inhibition period with a concomitant production of O(2). The results are accounted for by a mechanism in which tyrosyl radical is reduced to tyrosine by oxytyrosinase and the resulting met-form reacts with H(2)O(2) to return to the oxy-form.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are currently available to interrupt this cascade. Their positive actions result from better blood pressure control, a reduction in glomerular capillary pressure and a decrease in proteinuria. Blockade of the RAS may also reduce renal scarring by blunting direct pro-fibrotic effects of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Although these drugs successfully reduce urinary protein excretion and improve renal survival, a significant number of patients continue to progress to end stage renal disease. It is possible, however, that dual blockade of the RAS with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB might offer further benefit beyond using either agent alone. Optimally, the goal should be to completely halt the progression of kidney disease. With these concepts in mind, this paper will review the RAS and its effects on the kidney. The efficacy and safety of dual RAS blockade in proteinuric renal diseases will be examined. Finally, recommendations for utilising combined therapy with ACE inhibitors and ARBs will be provided.", 
    "187": "Heart failure (HF) still has a discouraging prognosis. Therapeutic strategies aim to reduce mortality as well as slow the progression of the disease, improve symptoms and reduce the frequency of hospital admission. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hallmark of several cardiocirculatory diseases, including HF. Drugs for evidence-based therapy of HF are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists. A promising alternative is a more complete action on the RAAS through selective blockade of the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, taking into account not only physiopathological issues but also pharmacological, experimental and clinical data. The effect of valsartan, an orally-active, selective antagonist of AT(1) receptors, on the outcome in patients with chronic and symptomatic HF was evaluated in a large-scale, international, placebo-controlled clinical study, the Valsartan in Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT). In this study, overall mortality was similar in the valsartan and placebo groups (19.7 and 19.4%, respectively). However, valsartan, in addition to recommended therapy of HF including an ACEI, significantly reduced the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation, paralleled by improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, signs and symptoms and quality of life. Valsartan also improved left ventricular anatomy and function and significantly reduced neurohormonal activation. These results were confirmed and extended by the CHARM trial, where the benefits of candesartan were proved not only in all 7599 patients with HF, but also in the 2548 given an ACEI, the 2028 not given an ACEI and in the 3023 patients with an ejection fraction of > 40%. In conclusion, the first choice for HF remains an ACEI with a beta-blocker, but two new options are emerging. In patients intolerant to ACEI, the combination of valsartan or candesartan with a beta-blocker is proposed, whereas an ACEI with either valsartan or candesartan can be considered in patients intolerant to or with contraindications to beta-blockers.",

They are formed via non-enzymatic glycation which is specifically enhanced through the presence of oxidative and carbonyl stress, and their ability to form glycoxidation products in peptide and protein structures finally modulating or inducing biological reactivity. Food can be another source of AGEs; however, high serum AGEs in hemodialysis patients might reflect nutritional status better. Several methods of renal replacement therapy have been studied in connection with the AGE removal, but unfortunately the possibilities are still unsatisfactory even if high flux dialysis, hemofiltration, or hemodiafiltration give better results than conventional low flux dialysis. AGEs are currently being studied in the patients on peritoneal dialysis as their precursors can be formed in the dialysis fluid. AGEs can cause damage to the peritoneum and so a loss of ultrafiltration capacity. Many compounds give promising results in AGE inhibition (inhibition of formation of AGEs, inhibition of their action or degradation of AGEs), are tested for these properties, and eventually undergo clinical studies (e.g. aminoguanidine, OPB-9195, pyridoxamine, antioxidants, N-phenacylthiazolium bromide, antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-1 antagonists).",

We previously reported that hyperglycemia augments both ANG II-induced growth and activation of Janus kinase (JAK)2 and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins in cultured rat mesangial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase enzyme JAK2 plays a key role in both ANG II- and hyperglycemia-induced growth in these cells. We hypothesized that the ACE inhibitor captopril and the ANG II-receptor antagonist candesartan would hinder hyperglycemic-induced activation of JAK and STAT proteins in rat glomeruli, demonstrating that ANG II plays an important role in the activation of these proteins in vivo. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given either streptozotocin (STZ; 60 mg/kg iv) or vehicle, and glomeruli were isolated 2 wk later. Activation of JAK and STAT proteins was evaluated by Western blot analysis for specific tyrosine phosphorylation. Groups of rats were given captopril (75-85 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), candesartan (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), or the JAK2 inhibitor AG-490 (5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for the study's duration. STZ stimulated glomerular phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. Phosphorylation was reduced in rats treated with captopril, candesartan, and AG-490. Furthermore, both candesartan and AG-490 inhibited STZ-induced increases in urinary protein excretion. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that hyperglycemia induces activation of JAK2 and the STATs in vivo via an ANG II-dependent mechanism and that these proteins may be involved in the early kidney damage associated with diabetes.", 
    "200": "The human cardiovascular system is regulated by haemodynamic, neurohumoral and structural mechanisms. The endothelium and the neurohumoral system play a key role in modulating both vascular tone and structure by producing vasoactive substances, and in the modulation of blood cell adhesion. Although the neurohormonal systems are essential in vascular homeostasis, they become maladaptive in conditions such as hypertension, coronary disease and heart failure. The clinical success of blocking the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and the sympathetic nerve system by beta-blockers demonstrates the importance of neurohumoral blockade. The inadequate effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor monotherapy seen in some patients treated for hypertension or congestive heart failure, and the promising effect seen after their combination, led to the development of drugs that simultaneously inhibit both enzyme systems. Neutral endopeptidase, like ACE, is an endothelial cell surface zinc metallopeptidase with similar structure and catalytic site to ACE. NEP is the major enzymatic pathway for degradation of natriuretic peptides. The natriuretic peptide system can be viewed as the endogenous inhibitor of the renin angiotensin system. The dual metalloprotease inhibitors of ACE and NEP, called vasopeptidase inhibitors therefore represent a new and attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The ability to add incremental benefit over already proven therapy, with an acceptable side-effect profile however, is questionable in this new class of agents.",

Because both agents are widely used in clinical practice, this combination regimen may represent a potential new strategy for HCC therapy in the future.", 
    "206": "Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is impaired in hypertension. Statins have been shown to improve endothelial functions in hyperlipidemic subjects. We aimed to investigate the effect of statins on endothelium-dependent flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and blood pressure (BP) in normocholesterolemic hypertensive patients.", 
    "207": "This randomized prospective study consisted of 56 patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension. All patients received angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril (5 mg/day) as antihypertensive therapy, and half of them were randomized to simvastatin(20mg/day) irrespective of serum lipid levels. All subjects underwent brachial artery ultrasonographic examination for the measurement of FMD before randomization and at the end of 12 weeks treatment.", 
    "208": "A total of 39 patients completed the study (21 patients in the statin + ACE inhibitor group, and 18 patients in the ACE-inhibitor alone group). Blood pressure levels were substantially reduced in both groups after treatment. In statin+ ACE-inhibitor group systolic pressure reduced by 23% (p=0.0001) and diastolic BP reduced by 23% (p=0.0001). In ACE-inhibitor alone group these ratios were 20% (p=0.001) and 21% (p=0.001), respectively. Meanwhile, pulse pressure (PP) decreased by 25% in statin+ ACE-inhibitor group (P=0.0001) and by 16% in ACE inhibitor-alone group (p=0.0051). Baseline FMD was significantly impaired in overall patients with hypertension as compared with healthy controls (13+/-8 vs. 24+/-8 %, P = 0.001). After treatment FMD decreased by 23% in lisinopril alone group (p=0.054). There were no correlations between FMD improvement, LDL reduction, BP or PP changes in both groups.", 
    "209": "Addition of simvastatin to ACE-inhibitor treatment in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients with normal cholesterol levels, significantly reduced PP and facilitated BP control, but did not affect endothelium-dependent dilatation. Further long-term large scale studies are needed to clarify the effect of various statins on endothelial functions of either hypercholesterolemic or normocholesterolemic hypertensive patients.", 
    "210": "It is well known that long-term therapy with beta-blockers reduces morbidity and mortality, improves left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. However the effect of beta-blockade on exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure remains unclear. In the present study we evaluated effects of the addition of bisoprolol to standart therapy with a diuretic and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "211": "We enrolled 52 patients (mean age 59+/-11 years) with stable, mild to moderate chronic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less receiving standart therapy with diuretic and ACE inhibitor. We randomly assigned patients to bisoprolol 1.25 mg (n=28) or control (n=24) groups. The drug progressively increased to a maximum dose of 5 mg per day. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed in all patients of the bisoprolol and control groups before and after 3 months from the beginning of the study.", 
    "212": "We found a significant increase in exercise duration, maximal O2 uptake (pik VO2), the O2 uptake at the anaerobic threshold (VO2-AT) and O2-pulse (pik VO2/HR), and improved functional capacity (p<0.001). Bisoprolol produced significant reduction in heart rate at rest (p=0.01) and during maximal exercise (p=0.041). In the control group no significant changes were observed.", 
    "213": "The addition of bisoprolol to the standart therapy in patients with mild to moderate heart failure is well tolerated and improves functional capacity.", 
    "214": "It was determined that flavan-3-ols and procyanidins have an inhibitory effect on angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and the effect was dependent on the number of epicatechin units forming the procyanidin. The inhibition by flavan-3-ols and procyanidins was competitive with the two substrates assayed: N-hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) and N-[3-(2-furyl)acryloyl]-L-phenylalanylglycylglycine (FAPGG). Tetramer and hexamer fractions were the more potent inhibitors, showing Ki of 5.6 and 4.7 microM, respectively. As ACE is a membrane protein, the interaction of flavanols and procyanidins with the enzyme could be related to the number of hydroxyl groups on the procyanidins, which determine their capacity to be adsorbed on the membrane surface.", 
    "215": "Hypertension plays a major role in the progression of both experimental and clinical chronic renal disease. However, the pathogenesis of the more slowly developing glomerulosclerosis that is seen even in the absence of overt hypertension, both in renal mass reduction models and in humans with chronic renal disease, remains controversial.", 
    "216": "The relationship of such glomerulosclerosis to the ambient blood pressure profiles was examined in the normotensive approximately 5/6 surgical excision rat remnant kidney model. Blood pressure was radiotelemetrically monitored at 10-minute intervals for 15 to 16 weeks ( approximately 15,000 blood pressure readings) in untreated rats (N= 13), or those treated with enalapril (N= 8), amlodipine (N= 9), or a combination of hydralazine, reserpine, and hydrochlorothiazide (N= 10).", 
    "217": "Even in these normotensive rats (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg), % glomerulosclerosis was significantly correlated with the overall average systolic blood pressure (r= 0.62, P < 0.0001; N= 40). However, much stronger correlations were observed between glomerulosclerosis and the % systolic blood pressure readings >150 mm Hg (r= 0.77, P < 0.0001) and the standard deviation of the average systolic blood pressure (r= 0.87, P < 0.0001).", 
    "218": "These data indicate that pressure dependent injury mechanisms continue to contribute to glomerular injury even within the \"normotensive\" blood pressure range in rats with reduced renal mass. This most likely represents the consequence of the impairment of protective renal autoregulation and enhanced glomerular transmission of the blood pressure fluctuations into the hypertensive range characteristic of the conscious state in both experimental animals and in humans. Such pathophysiology supports the need for more aggressive and around-the-clock blood pressure control in chronic renal disease.", 
    "219": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors possess dual inhibitory actions on neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and have beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling. However, the contribution of NEP inhibition to their effects is not yet fully understood. To address the role of cardiac NEP inhibition in the anti-remodeling effects of a vasopeptidase inhibitor, we examined the effects of omapatrilat on the development of cardiac remodeling in rats with left coronary artery ligation (CAL) and those on collagen synthesis in cultured fibroblast cells. In vivo treatment with omapatrilat (30 mg/kg/day for 5 weeks) inhibited cardiac NEP activity in rats with CAL, which was associated with a suppression of both cardiac hypertrophy and collagen deposition. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, omapatrilat (10(-7) to approximately 10(-5) M) inhibited NEP activity and augmented the ANP-induced decrease in [3H]-proline incorporation. ONO-BB, an active metabolite of the NEP selective inhibitor ONO-9902, also augmented the ANP-induced response, whereas captopril, an ACE inhibitor, did not. The angiotensin I-induced increase in [3H]-proline incorporation was prevented by omapatrilat and captopril, but not by ONO-BB. The results suggest that vasopeptidase inhibitor suppressed cardiac remodeling in the setting of chronic heart failure, possibly acting through the direct inhibition of cardiac NEP. Vasopeptidase inhibitors may have therapeutic advantages over the classical ACE and NEP inhibitors alone with respect to the regression of cardiac fibrosis.", 
    "220": "Apoptosis is involved in ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). We investigated the effects of the vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI) omapatrilat on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and compared it to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril in the rat post-MI model and in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Wistar males rats surviving 4 h post-MI were assigned to omapatrilat (40 or 80 mg/kg/day), captopril (160 mg/kg/day) or no treatment. After 56 days, hemodynamic measurements were performed (n = 96) and rats were sacrificed. One group had assessment of cardiac remodeling and detection of DNA fragments by in situ end labelling method (ISEL), while the other had morphologic measurements and DNA laddering assessed. In addition, cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (n = 6) were treated for 72 h with vehicle, captopril or omapatrilat in the presence or absence of the apoptosis inducing agent H2O2. Omapatrilat and captopril resulted in similar improvements of hemodynamic measurements, ventricular weight and dilatation, cardiac fibrosis and myocardial cell cross-section in large MI rats. Omapatrilat increased scar thickness more than did captopril. All sham-operated groups had little evidence of apoptosis. In the large MI group, there was a significant increase in ISEL-positive cells in the control (0.095 +/- 0.016%) and captopril (0.124 +/- 0.024%) groups in comparison with control sham-operated (0.006 +/- 0.006%), but this increase was limited to the peri-MI area. Omapatrilat (0.012 +/- 0.012% for both doses) prevented the increase in apoptosis in the peri-MI area. Also, omapatrilat but not captopril reduced DNA laddering in large MI. Moreover, in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, omapatrilat but not captopril reduced apoptosis as assessed by DNA laddering. The VPI omapatrilat, with its combination of NEP and ACE inhibition, suppresses cardiomyocyte apoptosis post-MI and in neonatal cultured rat cardiomyocytes more than the ACEI captopril, but this does not result in significant hemodynamic or morphologic differences between omapatrilat and captopril.", 
    "221": "Although activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is known to produce ventricular remodeling and congestive heart failure (CHF), its role in inducing changes in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein and gene expression in CHF is not fully understood. In this study, CHF was induced in rats by ligation of the left coronary artery for 3 weeks and then the animals were treated orally with or without an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan (20 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Sham-operated animals were used as control. The animals were hemodynamically assessed and protein content as well as gene expression of SR Ca(2+)-release channel (ryanodine receptor, RYR), Ca(2+)-pump ATPase (SERCA2), phospholamban (PLB) and calsequestrin (CQS) were determined in the left ventricle (LV). The infarcted animals showed cardiac hypertrophy, lung congestion, depression in LV +dP/dt and -dP/dt, as well as increase in LV end diastolic pressure. Both protein content and mRNA levels for RYR, SERCA2 and PLB were decreased without any changes in CQS in the failing heart. These alterations in LV function as well as SR protein and gene expression in CHF were partially prevented by treatment with enalapril or losartan. The results suggest that partial improvement in LV function by enalapril and losartan treatments may be due to partial prevention of changes in SR protein and gene expression in CHF and that these effects may be due to blockade of the RAS.",

Patients with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and/or prostatism carried a two-fold greater risk of prostate cancer than those without such antecedents. None of the other studied co-morbidities were associated with prostate cancer. We found that users of captopril had a relative risk of 0.7 (95% CI: 0.4-1.2) to develope prostate cancer. None of the other studied individual ACE-inhibitors shared a similar effect with the one observed for captopril.",

We therefore analyzed all children who were transplanted at our institution between 1989 and 1998 and followed for at least 2 years. Those treated with ACE-I, mainly because of failure of other antihypertensive medications, were compared to those without ACE-I. The ACE-I-treated children ( n=19) showed significantly better blood pressure control during the 1st year of follow-up ( p<0.05). In children with chronic allograft dysfunction ( n=8), treatment with ACE-I stabilized graft function, with improvement in creatinine clearance in 50% ( p<0.01). Serum potassium and hemoglobin levels remained stable. One patient discontinued ACE-I because of renal artery stenosis. Taken together, ACE-I were effective and safe in the treatment of hypertension in children following renal transplantation. Children with chronic allograft dysfunction experienced a stabilizing effect on graft function.", 
    "227": "Little is known about the role of proteinuria in the progression of childhood renal diseases. We analyzed the decline in creatinine clearance ( C(Cr)) and kidney survival in 225 children (185 males) with chronic renal failure (CRF) due to isolated hypodysplasia or hypodysplasia associated with urological abnormalities. The data were based on the information available in the Italian Pediatric Registry of CRF (ItalKid Project), which includes patients from all of Italy aged <20 years with C(Cr )levels of <75 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Patients aged <2 years and those with C(Cr )levels of <20 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or a follow-up of <1 year were excluded from the analysis, as were those receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. At baseline, the patients had a mean age of 7.8+/-4.2 years, a mean C(Cr )of 50+/-16.3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), a median urinary protein/urinary creatinine (uPr/uCr) ratio of 0.38 (range 0.02-7.21), and a mean duration of follow-up of 3.5+/-1.1 years. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of their baseline proteinuria levels: group A normal (uPr/uCr <0.2) n=83; group B low (uPr/uCr 0.2-0.9) n=71; and group C mild (uPr/uCr >0.9) n=71. Patients in groups A and B showed a significantly slower decline in C(Cr )than those in group C (slope +0.16+/-3.64 and -0.54+/-3.67 vs. -3.61+/-5.47, P<0.0001) and a higher rate of kidney survival after 5 years (96.7% and 94.1% vs. 44.9%, P<0.01). By multivariate analysis, the baseline uPr/uCr ratio ( P<0.01) and age ( P<0.0001) correlated with a faster decline in C(Cr )irrespective of baseline C(Cr). There was no correlation with mean arterial blood pressure. We conclude that proteinuria is an independent predictor of progression to end-stage renal failure also in children whose renal impairment is due to congenital hypodysplasia.",

Half of responses (50.4%) were from hospital physicians, 40.5% - from physicians of policlinics (outpatient clinics), 9.1% - from physicians working in other health care facilities. Most of respondents were internists (60.8%) and cardiologists (32.7%). Preferences concerning prescription of antihypertensive drugs were distributed in the following way: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors - 32% (50% captopril and enalapril); beta-adrenoblockers - 27% (77% atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol); diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide) - 22%; calcium antagonists - 15% (81% verapamil, nifedipine, diltiazem, 64% - long acting preparations); angiotensin receptor blockers - 1.7%; centrally acting drugs - 1.5%; alpha-adrenoblockers - 0.8%.",

Acute mortality was 9.6%; 28-day and one-year mortality were 11.4% and 16.5%, respectively. Of the patients with ST elevation-myocardial infarction of less than 12 hours' duration, 71.6% were reperfused and 89.3% received fibrinolysis with a median door-to-needle time of 48 minutes. Ejection fraction was measured in 81% of the patients, and 43% were tested for inducible ischemia. About nine-tenths (91%) of the patients were discharged on least one antiplatelet drug, 56% on a beta blocker, 45% on an ACE inhibitor, and 45% on a lipid-lowering agent, with a coefficient of variation between hospitals greater than 25% for the last three drugs.", 
    "240": "The percentage of patients with ST elevation treated with reperfusion should increase, as it probably will thanks to the increasing use of primary angioplasty. The door-to-needle time was longer than the recommended interval. In-hospital risk stratification was good but nonsystematic for the evaluation of ejection fraction, and unsatisfactory for inducible ischemia testing. At discharge the percentages of patients receiving beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins were not optimal, and there were wide variations in prescribing practices between hospitals.", 
    "241": "Reducing the effects of angiotensin II by blockade of AT1-receptors may be superior to inhibition of angiotensin II formation by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. However, the results of several trials did not fulfil this expectation. In both ELITE II with symptomatic CHF patients and in OPTIMAAL involving high risk patients after acute myocardial infarction, angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptor blocker (ARB) losartan did not prove to be superior to captopril. There are several potential reasons, why ARBs did not fare better than ACE inhibitors. Although AT1-receptor blockade may block the effects of non-ACE pathways of tissue angiotensin II formation, no clinical evidence is available that a more powerful inhibition of the tissue renin-angiotensin system brings improved survival. The choice of patients for clinical trials of HF therapy is not based on the level of neurohumoral activation. Thus, the more effective attenuation of angiotensin II action with ARBs may not bring additional benefits. The potential antiremodeling effect of ARBs through the stimulation of AT2 receptors by angiotensin II could be counterbalanced by a failure of AT1-receptor blockers to enhance bradykinin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin formation with antigrowth properties. Although ACE-inhibitors seem to have slightly better results at present than AT1 blockers in the battle on heart failure patient, future trials will decide which is the definitive winner.",

This study provides evidence that NIP-222 decreases urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in diabetic mice independent of its PPARgamma activation. We compared the effect of NIP-222 and another PPARgamma agonist, troglitazone, on UAE, plasma glucose level, blood pressure, and creatinine clearance (C(cr)) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Treatment for 3 weeks with NIP-222 (30 mg/kg) was associated with a significant decrease in UAE without any change in blood pressure, creatinine clearance, or plasma glucose level. In contrast, UAE did not decrease in mice treated with troglitazone (300 mg/kg). These results indicate that NIP-222 has PPARgamma independent effects on UAE in diabetic mice and suggest that this agent may have potential to minimize the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "247": "Patients with diabetes are at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) events and heart failure. Approximately 2-3 million diabetics in the U.S. have had a history of prior CV events. The prevalence of diabetes in patients with heart failure ranges from 24% reported in clinical trials to 47% among hospitalized patients, and an estimated 1-2 million persons in the U.S. have diabetes and heart failure. Diabetes substantially increases the risk of mortality after acute coronary syndromes and also increases the risk of hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure. It is now recognized that activation of multiple neurohormonal systems is central in the pathophysiology of diabetes, CV events, and heart failure. Pharmacologic intervention in these systems (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, aldosterone-receptor antagonism, and beta-blockade) has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in diabetics with prior CV events and/or heart failure. Despite this awareness, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta-blockers are underutilized, and deaths and hospitalizations caused by CV events and heart failure in diabetic patients have steadily increased. Concerns about an increased incidence of hypoglycemia, worsening dyslipidemia, and decreased insulin sensitivity resulting from the use of beta-blockers may be preventing physicians from prescribing these agents for diabetic patients. Beta-blockade in conjunction with ACE inhibition should be standard therapy for all diabetic patients. Optimal glycemic control therapy for patients with heart failure has not been well-defined, and there is an urgent need for randomized clinical trials to determine optimal treatment.", 
    "248": "Diabetes, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, is associated with a 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of coronary artery disease. As the population in the United States has aged, the incidence of obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia has increased significantly, culminating in the current epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Strict glycemic control must, therefore, be accompanied with proven therapies (such as antihypertensives and lipid-lowering agents) to reduce cardiovascular events. Patients with type 2 diabetes have average low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels but have an increased number of small, dense LDL particles, which are associated with a 3-fold increase in cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is also associated with increased triglyceride rich atherogenic particles, which trigger inflammation. In addition to glycemic control and drug therapy, lifestyle modifications (eg, diet, weight loss, and exercise) also play an important role in managing diabetes. Therefore, strict glycemic control, pharmacologic therapy, and lifestyle modifications are parts of a comprehensive strategy to prevent both microvascular and macrovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

To address this issue, the authors evaluated the comparative effects of the administration schedule on neurohumoral factors and autonomic nervous activity in patients with CHF. Thirty-two patients with mild compensated CHF received lisinopril (5-20 mg/d) orally either once a day (n = 17) or twice a day (n = 15) for more than 3 months. After this initial therapy, patients receiving a once-daily regimen switched to a twice-daily regimen and vice-versa, and patients were followed for an additional 3 months. Neurohumoral factors and the coefficient of variance in the electrocardiographic R-R interval (CVRR) were measured. Hemodynamic parameters, renal function, plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide and aldosterone, and CVRR did not differ between the two regimens. However, the plasma concentration of norepinephrine was significantly lower, and plasma renin activity tended to be lower with the twice-daily regimen. These findings suggest that twice-daily administration of long-acting ACE inhibitors may have better effects on the neuroendocrine system than a once-daily regimen in patients with mild CHF.",

Five and 12 weeks after transplantation, left ventricle (LV) function was assessed in a Langendorff apparatus, and histologic and immunohistological evaluation of the LV scars was performed.",

    "258": "Glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism (GRA) appears to be the most common monogenic form of human hypertension. As a result of chimeric gene duplication, aldosterone is ectopically synthesized in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland under the control of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). Affected individuals are typically hypertensive, often with onset in youth, and demonstrate refractoriness to standard antihypertensives such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. GRA subjects are normokalemic but often develop hypokalemia when treated with a potassium-wasting diuretic. Analysis of affected kindreds has demonstrated a high prevalence of early cerebral hemorrhage, largely as a result of aneurysms. Identification of affected individuals should allow direct neurovascular screening and targeted antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "259": "The incidence of diabetes as cause of end-stage renal failure (ESRF) has significantly increased, and will continue to grow during the next few years. Moreover, diabetic nephropathy is associated with elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These guidelines focus on the possible intervention strategies to prevent and treat ESRF in diabetic patients. In normoalbuminuric patients, glycated haemoglobin levels less than and equal to 7.5% is mandatory for reducing the risk of incipient nephropathy. Furthermore, blood pressure levels < 130/80 mmHg are strongly recommended. In microalbuminuric patients, glycated hemoglobin levels below 7.5% and blood pressure levels below 130/80 mmHg (120/70-75 mmHg in patients < 50 years) are recommended. Moreover, there is evidence that inhibition of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, either by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRA) is able to reduce the incidence of overt nephropathy, regardless of blood pressure levels. Current guidelines recommed ACE-I as the first-choice drug in type 1 diabetes, while both ACE-I and AAIRA are considered first-choice therapy in type 2 diabetes. In proteinuric patients it is uncertain whether glycemic control affects the progression of nephropathy, which in turn is dramatically influenced by blood pressure. Optimal blood pressure levels are below 130/80 mmHg (120/70-75 mmHg in patients < 50 years). In type 1 diabetes there is consensus on the renoprotective role of ACE-1. In type 2 diabetes, two recent trials demonstrated that AIIRA are more effective than conventional therapy or calcium channel blockers in slowing down the progression of nephropathy. ACE-I are indeed recommended as first-choice drugs in type 1 diabetes while AIIRA are the first-choice agents for ESRF prevention in type 2 diabetes. Dialysis treatment should be started as soon as the creatinine clearance is reduced to about 10-15 mL/min. The choice of dialysis schedule should be individualized according to clinical and adequacy criteria (CAPD weekly Kt/V > or = 2 and single HD session Kt/V > or = 1.5). Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation should be the first-choice therapeutic option in type 1 diabetes, while renal transplantation has been demonstrated to significantly improve the prognosis of type 2 diabetes patients with ESRF.",

During this period, 3,148 diagnostic cardiac catheterizations and 1,515 selective spasm provocation tests were performed. Seventy-four of these 349 patients (21.2%) had VA. Coronary spasms were defined as transient luminal narrowings of > 99%, and VA was defined as an ST elevation during spontaneous attacks or noninvasive stress tests. We classified the 12 years of the study into four periods of 3 years each. No tendency to decrease for the ratio of the number of patients with CSA and the number of selective spasm provocation tests was observed among the four time periods (18%, 24%, 32%, and 23%, respectively). However, the number of patients with VA (28, 33, 9, and 4) and the VA/CSA ratio (32%, 28%, 14%, and 5%, respectively) in the four group significantly decreased. The frequency of administration of calcium antagonists (CAs) before hospital admission (49% vs 33%, respectively; p < 0.05) was significantly higher in the last time period (from 2000 to 2002) than in the first period (from 1991 to 1993). L-CAs were administered in > 90% of CSA patients who had been medicated with CAs before hospital admission in the last period (from 2000 to 2002), while L-CAs were administered in only 20% in the former period (from 1991 to 1993). The administration of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers before hospital admission gradually increased according to the period passed, but not significantly.",

Regional haemodynamic responses to a continuous, 4-day infusion of the selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, UK-357,903 (0.133 or 1.33 mg x kg(-1) h(-1)) were measured in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, and compared with those of enalapril (1 mg x kg(-1) h(-1)). 2. Both doses of UK-357,903 caused modest reductions in mean blood pressure that were not dose-dependent and only significantly different from the vehicle effects on Day 1 of the study (mean -11.8 and -15.3 mmHg for low and high doses, respectively). UK-357,903 had mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilator effects, which were, again, similar for both dose levels and only significantly different from vehicle on Day 1. Neither dose of UK-357,903 affected renal vascular conductance or heart rate. 3. Although the haemodynamic effects of UK-357,903 were not clearly dose-related and some appeared to wane with time, geometric mean plasma levels of UK-357,903 increased in proportion to dose, and were sustained throughout the infusion period. Furthermore, plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate, a biomarker of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition, was persistently elevated, and increased with increasing dose. 4. Enalapril caused a fall in mean blood pressure on day 1 (-14.1 mmHg) that was associated with dilatation in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. The haemodynamic effects of enalapril were sustained or increased over the 4-day infusion, although plasma free drug levels were stable. 5. In conclusion, we have shown regional and temporal changes in the haemodynamic effects of UK-357,903, which may be due to activation of compensatory mechanisms, but there were no signs of functional compensation to the cardiovascular effects of enalapril.", 
    "265": "In previous studies, transrectal color Doppler sonography was used to demonstrate an increase in genital blood flow resistance in subfertile mares. The objectives of the present study were to determine the effects of an anticoagulant (acetylsalicylic acid) and a vasodilator (captopril) on uterine and ovarian perfusion and plasma progesterone concentrations in cycling mares. From Day 1 to 11 of an estrous cycle (Day 0=day of ovulation following prostaglandin-induced luteolysis), five Trotter mares were given 2500 mg lactose, 2500 mg ASA, or 50 mg captopril twice daily in their feed (one compound per cycle, in random order). Transrectal color Doppler sonography was used to examine both uterine arteries and the ovarian artery ipsilateral to the corpus luteum once daily, immediately prior to administration of the drug. Blood flow resistance was determined semiquantitatively using the pulsatility index (PI) and plasma progesterone concentrations were determined with an enzyme immunoassay. Compared to the placebo, both ASA and captopril decreased mean PI values of both uterine arteries of all mares. On average, ASA decreased the PI of the uterine arteries by 25%; this was more (P<0.05) than the average decrease (13%) caused by captopril. Both drugs decreased (P<0.05) blood flow resistance in the ovarian arteries, although there was no difference (P<0.05) in their efficacy. In addition, both ASA and captopril increased (P<0.0001) plasma progesterone concentrations (18 and 17%, respectively). In conclusion, either ASA or captopril improved uterine and ovarian perfusion; however the effects on fertility were not determined.", 
    "266": "Renal failure involves a significant impairment of the essential functions of the kidney, which can be either acute with sudden and rapid onset (acute renal failure [ARF]) or chronic with gradual onset (chronic renal failure [CRF]). ARF, if detected early, may be halted or reversed, whereas CRF is generally irreversible. Without treatment or intervention, both forms of renal failure lead to end stage renal failure (ESRF) or end stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the form of dialysis or renal transplantation for survival. However, provision of RRT requires expert teams working in specialised units, making therapy of patients with renal failure expensive; furthermore, RRT is complex, with its own complications. Although pharmacological interventions have shown promise in experimental models, these have not been as successful in the clinical setting (e.g., administration of atrial natriuretic peptide, low-dose dopamine). At present, drugs are administered during CRF to either reduce one of the many risk factors of CRF (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins) or to deal with the consequences of CRF (e.g., erythropoietin, calcitriol). Recent evidence suggests that some of these interventions may provide further direct beneficial effects via reduction of renal inflammation. Although these interventions have greatly improved the prospects for patients suffering ESRF, the development of novel drugs and therapies with which to reduce the consequences of renal failure and ESRD remain topics of great interest. This article reviews the therapies available for the prevention and management of renal failure in adults and describes, in detail, emerging drugs and novel interventions that may soon become available for the treatment or prevention of ESRF.", 
    "267": "An analytical method based on on-line liquid chromatography-biochemical detection (LC-BCD) coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry was developed for the detection and identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in complex mixtures, such as hydrolyzed whey proteins. ACE inhibitory activity was detected by coupling a homogeneous, substrate conversion based bioassay on-line to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chemical information was obtained by directing part of the HPLC effluent towards a mass spectrometer. After correlating the biochemical and chemical data, the accurate molecular masses of the bioactive peptides were used as search queries in protein databases. Combined with the recorded mass spectrometry (MS)-MS fingerprints, bioactive peptides were selected from the database search results. The results of LC-BCD-MS analyses were verified by establishing a bioactivity balance. Reference samples, containing several peptides at concentration levels similar to those observed in the hydrolyzed milk samples, were analyzed by LC-BCD-MS. High recoveries of biological activity were obtained, indicating that the correct ACE inhibitors were identified and that no co-elution of significantly bioactive molecules had occurred. Approximately, 30 ACE inhibitors were detected and identified. IC50 values of ACE inhibitors, reported in literature, ranged between 43 and 580 microM.",

    "272": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors effectively interfere with the renin-angiotensin system and exert various beneficial actions on vascular structure and function beyond their blood pressure-lowering effects. Data from experimental studies showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can attenuate the development of atherosclerosis in a wide range of species. The postulated mechanisms of this atheroprotective effect are the antioxidant actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and their enhancement of the endothelial elaboration of bioactive nitric oxide. The aim of this study was to assess the comparative effects of three angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on endothelial nitric oxide production and action, and on endothelial oxidative stress. Using bovine aortic endothelial cells in culture grown to confluence, we examined the effects of 1, 10, 30 and 60 microM of each of captopril, zofenopril and enalapril on nitrite/nitrate accumulation in the media, cyclic GMP accumulation in the cell lysate, and F(2)-isoprostanes in lipid extracts from the cells. Results showed that the sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor zofenopril has unique properties compared with captopril and enalapril. This compound improves nitric oxide production and bioactivity, and does so in conjunction with decreased endothelial cell oxidant stress. The biochemical basis for this protective mechanism is not entirely clear; however, these actions suggest that zofenopril may reduce endothelial effects of risk factors for atherothrombotic disease.",

Using positron emission tomography (PET), we investigated the response of regional myocardial perfusion to acute ACE inhibition with i.v. infusion of perindoprilat (vs saline infusion as control, minimum interval 3 days) in 12 diabetic patients with LVH. Myocardial perfusion was quantified with PET using nitrogen-13 ammonia infused at rest and during dipyridamole hyperaemia. Twelve healthy control subjects were included in the study, five of whom were also studied with perindoprilat. Mean blood pressure in normo-albuminuric, asymptomatic patients was 123+/-7/65+/-9 mmHg. Compared with controls, maximal perfusion was reduced in patients (1.8+/-0.6 vs 2.5+/-1.0 ml min(-1) g(-1); P<0.05), and perfusion reserve was also lower, at borderline significance (2.7+/-1.0 vs 3.6+/-1.3; P=0.059). During perindoprilat infusion, myocardial perfusion reserve in patients increased to 3.9+/-0.9 ( P<0.001) due to normalisation of maximal perfusion (2.3+/-0.5 ml min(-1) g(-1), P<0.01). In the five control subjects both resting and hyperaemic perfusion remained unchanged during perindoprilat infusion. It is concluded that acute ACE inhibition with perindoprilat improves maximal achieved myocardial perfusion in non-hypertensive patients with diabetes and LVH.",

In 10 European countries, 1283 patients older than 80 years and with a sustained blood pressure of 160-219/90-109 mmHg were allocated randomly to one of three treatments: a diuretic-based regimen (usually bendroflumethiazide; n = 426), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor regimen (usually lisinopril; n = 431) or no treatment (n = 426). The procedure permitted doses of the drug to be titrated and diltiazem slow-release to be added to active treatment. Target blood pressure was < 150/80 mmHg and mean follow-up was 13 months.", 
    "305": "In the combined actively treated groups, the reduction in stroke events relative hazard rate (RHR) was 0.47 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.93] and the reduction in stroke mortality RHR was 0.57 (95% CI 0.25 to 1.32). However, the estimate of total mortality supported the possibility of excess deaths with active treatment (RHR 1.23, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.01).", 
    "306": "The preliminary results support the need for the continuing main HYVET trial. It is possible that treatment of 1000 patients for 1 year may reduce stroke events by 19 (nine non-fatal), but may be associated with 20 extra non-stroke deaths.", 
    "307": "Chronic heart failure is widely recognised as a common and escalating problem that causes major disability and often shortens life. Diuretics and digoxin have formed the mainstay of treatment for many years. Clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzymes and beta-blockers, in selected patients, improve symptoms and reduce mortality. Angiotensin-II antagonists and spironolactone may also have a role in certain individuals. Newer pharmacological approaches to the management of this complex disease are being developed, but await full evaluation.",

In addition, farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase activities were specifically inhibited by FTI-277 and GGTI-298, respectively.", 
    "310": "Only inhibition of geranylgeranylation by lovastatin led to reduction of cell viability in lymphoma cell lines and purified tumor cells from lymphoma patients in a time- and dose-dependent way. Reduction in the number of viable cells was mediated by both induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. In addition, GGTI-298 was more effective in induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation than FTI-277. Apoptosis induced by inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation was associated with a reduction of Mcl-1 protein levels, collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and caspase-3 activation. Inhibition of proliferation resulted from the induction of G(1) arrest. Furthermore, lovastatin at low concentrations sensitized lymphoma cells to dexamethasone, including cells resistant to this drug.", 
    "311": "These results indicate that protein geranylgeranylation is critical for the regulation of lymphoma tumor cell survival and proliferation and that pharmacological agents such as lovastatin or geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors, alone or in combination with other drugs, may be useful in the treatment of lymphoma.",

Autonomic neuropathy was observed in 64% while 76% had peripheral neuropathy; but there was no improvement with losartan. The duration of diabetes had a negative correlation with autonomic neuropathy. It also had a similar negative correlation with median and common peroneal nerve motor conduction velocities (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = -0.53, P<0.01 and r = -0.56, P<0.01 respectively) implying that autonomic and peripheral neuropathy worsen as a diabetic ages. However, no correlation existed between albuminuria and autonomic or peripheral nerve function.",

    "320": "The zebrafish T-box transcription factors spadetail (spt) and the brachyury ortholog no tail (ntl) are together essential for posterior mesoderm formation. In addition to being functionally redundant, spt and ntl also genetically interact with zygotic mutant alleles of one-eyed pinhead (Zoep), leading to synergistic mesodermal defects. Here we have used genetic and pharmacological assays to address the mechanism of these interactions. We show that Zoep and ntl are together required upstream of spt expression, accounting for the severity of the mesodermal defects in Zoep;ntl embryos. Since Xenopus brachyury is proposed to regulate fgf expression, and FGF signaling is required for spt expression, we analyzed the involvement of the FGF signaling pathway in these genetic interactions. Using a specific inhibitor of FGFR activity to indirectly assay the strength of FGF signaling in individual embryos, we found that spt and ntl mutant embryos were both hypersensitive to the FGFR inhibitor. This hypersensitivity is consistent with the possibility that Spt and Ntl function upstream of FGF signaling. Furthermore, we show that minor pharmacological or genetic perturbations in FGF signaling are sufficient to dramatically enhance the Zoep mutant phenotype, providing a plausible explanation for why Zoep genetically interacts with spt and ntl. Finally, we show that Zoep and ace/fgf8 function are essential for the formation of all posterior tissues, including spinal cord. Taken together, our data provide strong in vivo support for the regulation of FGF signaling by T-box transcription factors, and the cooperative activity of Oep and FGF signaling during the formation of posterior structures.",

Therefore, the appropriate therapeutic management of uremic microinflammation is not yet established. Meanwhile, it appears to be reasonable to use current non-specific anti-inflammatory therapies (e.g. ACEI, statins) in order to reduce uremic micro-inflammation. However, it is clear that such an approach is not sufficient, and further strategies (e.g. vitamin E) are warranted to optimize uremic micro-inflammation prevention.",

The present study examined if prevention and intervention treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril could improve peripheral and central neurophysiological deficits in streptozotocin-diabetic rats.", 
    "323": "Sciatic nerve conduction velocities were measured prior to diabetes induction and again every three weeks. In the prevention study, the final nerve conduction measurements were performed at 15 weeks and in the intervention study at 24 weeks. Brain stem auditory and visual evoked potential latencies were measured every 3 weeks from 10 weeks after diabetes induction. In the prevention study, the final evoked potential measurements were performed at 16 weeks and in the intervention study at 25 weeks.

Enalapril prevented deficits in nerve conduction velocity (p < 0.001), brain stem auditory evoked potential latencies (p < 0.01) and visual evoked potential latencies (p < 0.005). Enalapril intervention treatment had no effect on nerve conduction velocity and on visual evoked potential latencies, but improved brain stem auditory evoked potential latencies (p < 0.05) after 10 weeks of treatment.",

    "326": "In addition to being a pro-inflammatory mediator, bradykinin is now recognized as a neuromediator and regulator of several vascular and renal functions. New breakthroughs point to unusual and atypical signalling pathways for a G-protein coupled receptor that could explain the anti-proliferative and anti-fibrogenic effects of bradykinin. The availability of transgenic and knock out animal models for bradykinin receptors or bradykinin-synthesizing or -catabolic enzymes confirms these cardiac and renal protective roles for this peptide system. Bradykinin receptors are involved in the therapeutic action of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme inhibitors that are used in the treatment of arterial hypertension, heart failure and diabetes. Nevertheless, recent evidence highlights dissimilar mechanisms in the regulation and function of these receptors between the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Therefore, the development of more specific bradykinin receptor agonists or antagonists devoid of central actions seems to evolve as a new therapeutic approach.",

    "331": "Spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses, including the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), associate with cellular receptors to mediate infection of their target cells. Here we identify a metallopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), isolated from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-permissive Vero E6 cells, that efficiently binds the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein. We found that a soluble form of ACE2, but not of the related enzyme ACE1, blocked association of the S1 domain with Vero E6 cells. 293T cells transfected with ACE2, but not those transfected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 receptors, formed multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing S protein. Furthermore, SARS-CoV replicated efficiently on ACE2-transfected but not mock-transfected 293T cells. Finally, anti-ACE2 but not anti-ACE1 antibody blocked viral replication on Vero E6 cells. Together our data indicate that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV.", 
    "332": "Chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase promotes renin-dependent hypertension and renal injury. The present study examines how renal angiotensin II receptors are expressed in this model. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was given orally to rats for 1 month and was associated or not with captopril during the 4 last days of the administration. 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]-Ang II binding, AT1)mRNA and cytosolic calcium were studied in isolated glomeruli from L-NAME and control rats and in cultured mesangial cells from normal rats. Renal injury was marked in rats receiving L-NAME. Type I angiotensin II (AT1) receptor number and mRNA expression were decreased (p < 0.05) in glomeruli isolated from L-NAME-treated rats compared with controls, unless they received captopril in combination. The low level of AT1 receptor expression was associated with an attenuated rise of cytosolic calcium in response to angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in glomeruli and angiotensin II concentration in renal cortex were increased (p < 0.05) in rats receiving L-NAME alone, whereas aminopeptidase A activity was not modified. To better discriminate between the direct and indirect effects of nitric oxide deficiency, rat mesangial cells were exposed or not for 24 h to S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine, a nitric oxide donor. Angiotensin II binding, AT1 mRNA expression and calcium response to angiotensin II were decreased in presence of the nitric oxide donor (p < 0.01). These results suggest that the decrease of AT1 receptor expression after 1 month of L-NAME treatment does not depend on a direct effect of nitric oxide deficiency but results from the high local angiotensin II concentration due to the stimulated angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. They also show that the renin-angiotensin dependence of this model of hypertension does not result from the overexpression of AT1 receptors.", 
    "333": "Menopausal women should not consider that hormonal treatment is an obligatory long-term commitment. Estrogen-based treatments are extremely effective for vasomotor symptom relief and for vaginal atrophy. HRT also is one of several effective methods for the primary prevention of osteoporosis. If trials were done early after the menopause when the endothelium is likely still to be intact, estrogen-based treatment might be shown to prevent coronary heart disease. However, greater efficacy is to be expected from smoking cessation, proper nutrition, exercise, moderate alcohol consumption, statins, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The treatment options for a menopausal woman should include non-drug-related strategies, non-hormonal pharmaceutical therapies as well as hormonal treatments. The first objective of this contribution is to call to the attention of practising physicians the fact that the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) studies involved women much older than the early postmenopausal age groups for whom HRT is prescribed because of symptoms. The second objective is to emphasize that the attending physicians must not only treat the symptomatic women but also prevent the occurrence of diseases more prevalent after 60 years of age. Hormones can safely be used for the former, when not contraindicated, whereas for the latter non-pharmacological interventions and non-hormonal medications are preferable.", 
    "334": "Experiments were done in the anaesthetized rat to determine the effect of activation of renal receptors following renal arterial occlusion (RAO) on the induction of c-fos in neurons of the lamina terminalis in the forebrain. Following RAO, fos labeled neurons were found in both the subfornical organ (SFO) and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT). Transection of the renal nerves ipsilateral to RAO reduced ( approximately 61%) the number of fos labeled neurons in the SFO and prevented the fos labeling in the OVLT. Similarly, administration of the angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril maleate prior to RAO also reduced ( approximately 27%) the number of fos labeled neurons in the SFO to RAO. However, the number of fos labeled neurons was not altered in the OVLT. The number of fos labeled neurons in the SFO of the intact animals after RAO was found to be greater than the algebraic sum of the number of fos labeled neurons in the renal nerve transected and enalapril treated animals. These results suggest that neurons in the SFO are activated by at least two different mechanisms following renal artery occlusion; those involving the activation of afferent renal nerves and those due to changes in circulating levels of angiotensin II. In addition, afferent renal nerve inputs combined with the effect of increased circulating levels of angiotensin II produce a greater activation of the SFO than either input alone. On the other hand, the OVLT appears to be selectively activated by afferent renal nerve inputs following RAO. Taken together, these data suggest that neural inputs from the kidney may play an important role in controlling body fluid balance and arterial pressure (AP) by influencing the activity of forebrain circumventricular organs neurons that function in the detection of blood borne signals associated with changes in extracellular fluid volume.",

Peripheral vascular disease was diagnosed by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.90 and as severe PVD if ABI < 0.80. Association was evaluated before and after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, hypertension, smoking, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), usage of insulin, and usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB); and for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP), respectively. Results showed that PP increased from no (n = 348) to mild (n = 25) and severe (n = 23) PVD (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001; multiple comparisons, p < 0.05 for any two groups). The PP increase from no to mild PVD was due to SBP increase; while further increase to severe PVD was due to both DBP drop and an even higher SBP. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for PVD for every 1-mmHg PP increment was 1.035 (1.012-1.058). When PP was categorized as tertiles (< 50, 50-59 and > or = 60 mmHg), respective AOR for PVD for second and third vs. first tertile was 2.605 (1.008-6.729) and 2.835 (1.123-7.156). Pulse pressure was also predictive for ABI independent of the effects of the confounders and the other parameters of blood pressure. In conclusion, PP was an independent predictor and correlated with severity of PVD in type 2 diabetic patients.",

The early diagnosis of RVH permits specific treatment leading to the cure of hypertension and avoidance of parenchymal damage. Captopril renal scintigraphy (CRS) provides information on the renovascular cause of the arterial hypertension. To validate the usefulness of CRS in hypertensive children, clinical, scintigraphic, and radiological data from 20 patients (mean age 6.1+/-5.5 years) were reviewed. Two patients were newborns. All had renal ultrasound scans and 9 had aortograms. In 7 children, RVH was confirmed by angiography, and CRS was positive for RVH in 6 of these. CRS was negative for RVH in 12 of 13 children without RVH. CRS was non-diagnostic in 3 children with abnormal baseline renal scintigraphy and severely decreased relative renal function ( <35%), 1 of whom had RVH.

Patients in group A ( n=11) received enalapril at low doses for 8 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of washout and then at high doses for 8 weeks. Those in group B ( n=14) initially received enalapril at high and then low doses. Patients continued to receive treatment with tapering doses of prednisolone; none received concomitant therapy with daily oral or intravenous steroids, alkylating agents, cyclosporine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other antihypertensive medications. The urine albumin-to-creatinine (Ua/Uc) ratio and the percentage reduction were determined for each phase of therapy. Baseline clinical, biochemical, and histological features were comparable in the two groups. In the first phase, treatment with low-dose enalapril (group A) resulted in median 34.8% Ua/Uc reduction compared with 62.9% with high doses (group B) ( P<0.01). High-dose enalapril was associated with a significant reduction in Ua/Uc ratio in both groups. The combined median Ua/Uc (95% confidence interval) reduction in the low-dose phase was 33% (-10.3% to 72.4%) and in the high-dose 52% (15.4%-70.4%) ( P<0.05). The median Ua/Uc ratio at the end of 20 weeks was 1.1 and 1.8 in groups A and B, respectively ( P>0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions were similar in both groups. No period or carry-over effect was found. Prolonged treatment with enalapril thus resulted in a dose-related reduction in nephrotic-range proteinuria. Titration of the dose of enalapril may be a useful strategy for achieving substantial reduction of proteinuria in children with SRNS.",

Little is known about the acute effects of these compounds on vascular reactivity of coronary resistance vessels. Coronary arterioles were obtained from patients undergoing coronary bypass operation (atherosclerosis group) or valve replacement (control group). Responses to endothelium-dependent agonists (histamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine) as well as to the endothelium-independent agonist sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were investigated under baseline conditions and after incubation (15 min) with lisinopril (ACE inhibitor), candesartan (AT(1) receptor antagonist), or fluvastatin. In atherosclerotic vessels, vasorelaxation was significantly reduced to all endothelium-dependent agonists but not, however, to SNP (77 +/- 8, -24 +/- 16, -46 +/- 24, and 98 +/- 8% relaxation for histamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and SNP, respectively). Lisinopril and fluvastatin but not candesartan significantly improved the responses to the endothelium-dependent agonists (lisinopril: 94 +/- 4, 17 +/- 22, and -20 +/- 13%; fluvastatin: 96 +/- 8, 23 +/- 21, and -25 +/- 18% relaxation for histamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine, respectively). The effect of lisinopril was prevented by pretreatment with a bradykinin antagonist (HOE-130) and dichloroisocoumarine, an inhibitor of kinine-forming enzymes. Pretreatment with a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor abolished the improvement of endothelial function by lisinopril and fluvastatin. Vascular reactivity in the control group was not influenced by any of the pharmacological interventions. The data demonstrate that in atherosclerosis, endothelium-dependent relaxation of coronary resistance arteries is severely compromised. The impairment can acutely be reversed by ACE inhibitors and statins via increasing the availability of NO.", 
    "355": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates toxicity of xenobiotics, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Genetic deletion of the AhR leads to cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting a role for the AhR in cardiovascular physiology and disease; however, the pathways involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy have not been determined. Thus, we investigated the role of (1) pressure overload using indwelling catheters and (2) vasoactive peptides endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II), assessed by RIA, in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy in AhR-null mice. Histochemical analysis, expression of cardiac hypertrophy marker genes, and echocardiography were used to assess the degree of cardiac hypertrophy. AhR-null mice developed elevated mean arterial pressures (MAP) by 5 months, which was associated with a two- and ninefold increase in plasma ET-1 and Ang II, respectively, compared to wild-type. Captopril-treatment (4 mg/kg) of AhR-null mice from 2 to 5 months of age significantly decreased MAP and plasma Ang II, but did not affect ET-1. Further, captopril improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac hypertrophy as evidenced by reduction in left ventricle mass, left ventricle internal dimension, and molecular cardiac hypertrophy markers. Captopril also decreased fibrosis of the heart and kidney. These findings show that pressure overload is associated with elevated ET-1 and hypertrophic growth of the heart and that cardiac hypertrophy is mediated, in part, by Ang II.", 
    "356": "Evidence now exists suggesting a pathologic role for angiotensin II in patients with cardiovascular disease and those with risk factors. Clinical trials such as the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension Study (LIFE), the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study (HOPE), the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), and the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study have clearly demonstrated that blood pressure reduction is important in hypertension and diabetes. If this can be accomplished with agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, then additional clinical benefit will be achieved. Clinical data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are well established, while emerging data on the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) continue to grow. There is evidence supporting the concept of angiotensin II escape in the presence of ACEIs. The question that remains to be answered is whether a combination of both agents (ACEIs and ARBs) can improve clinical outcomes. Ongoing clinical trials will answer this question.", 
    "357": "The therapeutic benefits of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been inconsistent on renal function and proteinuria. To know the contribution of the heterogeneity of study subjects to such inconsistency, we evaluated the effects of dual blockade of RAS in 2 groups of selected renal diseases, IgA and diabetic nephropathy. To avoid confounding by the blood pressure-reducing effects, angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ATRAs) were added on the patients with long-term, optimally controlled blood pressure taking ACE inhibitors. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein excretion rate and urinary TGF-beta1 level were measured as surrogate markers of renal injury.", 
    "358": "We conducted a prospective crossover trial with 14 IgA and 18 type-2-diabetic nephropathy patients showing moderate degree of proteinuria (> or = 1.0 g/day) and renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 25 - 75/ml/min). Four to 8 mg once-daily dose of candesartan and placebo were alternatively added on ramipril dose of 5 - 7.5 mg/day for 16 weeks.", 
    "359": "All baseline data except for the age factor were statistically the same between the 2 disease groups. Twenty-four-hour mean arterial blood pressures were 91.2 +/- 1.6 and 92.3 +/- 1.8 mmHg in IgA and diabetic nephropathy patients respectively at baseline (p = NS). Mean arterial pressure did not change by the addition of candesartan or placebo in both groups. The addition of candesartan (combination) reduced 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate in IgA nephropathy patients with a mean change of -12.3 +/- 4.5%, which is significantly greater compared to a mean change of -0.1 +/- 3.3% after the addition of placebo (placebo) (mean difference 12.4 +/- 5.0, 95% CI 1.2 - 23.5; p < 0.05). Urinary TGF-beta1 level was reduced considerably by the combination therapy, with a -28.9 +/- 6.0% decrease, which was significantly different to that by the placebo, with +4.3 +/- 12.4% (33.3 +/- 13.5, 3.2 - 63.3; p < 0.05). In diabetic nephropathy patients, the addition of candesartan did not reduce 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate. Mean changes of 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate were -0.8 +/- 4.7% by the combination therapy and +0.5 +/- 6.1% by placebo (mean difference 1.3 +/- 4.7, 95% CI -6.8 - 13.5; p < NS). The level of urinary TGF-beta1 was reduced by the combination therapy, with -14.3 +/- 9.5% decrease, but it did not reach statistical significance compared to placebo of +0.7 +/- 15.5% (15.0 +/- 13.5, -14.4 - 44.5; p < NS). The changes in 24-hour urinary protein excretion rate and urinary TGF-beta1 level were neither correlated with each other, nor with the change in mean arterial pressure. Significant changes in the renal function were not detected during the study period.", 
    "360": "Definite beneficial effects of dual blockade of RAS on proteinuria and TGF-beta1 excretion were found in IgA nephropathy patients, which was independent of blood pressure-reducing effect. With our 16-week trial, such benefits were not observed in type 2 diabetic nephropathy. The reduction in urinary TGF-beta1 level suggests that the combination therapy may provide additional renoprotection through the antisclerosing effects. Based on our results, for a proper interpretation the therapeutic effects of the combination therapy should be evaluated separately according to the underlying renal disease.", 
    "361": "Approximately 5 million people in the United States are living with heart failure. The prevalence of heart failure is increasing as the mean age of the population of the US increases. Prognosis is poor: About half of all patients who have heart failure die within 5 years of onset. Management of heart failure has 3 major goals: (1) the specific treatment of the underlying cardiac disease; (2) relief of symptoms and improvement of quality of life; and (3) modification of the long-term neurohormonal progression. From clinical trial data, beta-blockers are recommended in national heart failure management guidelines as part of the standard therapy, along with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and (usually) digoxin. Other agents such as angiotensin II-receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) receptor antagonists may also be important.", 
    "362": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an angiotensin-converting enzyne inhibitor (ACEI, quinapril) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB, candesartan) on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) activity in rats with hypertension induced by nitric oxide (NO) inhibition. ACEI and ARB have a number of pharmacologic effects, including blood pressure reduction, myocardial preservation, and an unknown effect in the circulation. The changes in ANP in NO inhibitor-induced hypertensive rats were evaluated in order to elucidate the interaction between ANP and NO in the regulation of blood pressure. Thirty-six rats were divided into 4 groups and administered the experimental agents for 8 weeks: group CONTROL was given regular food (n=9), group N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) was administered L-NNA (25 mg. kg(-1). day(-1), n=9), group ACEI was administered L-NNA and quinapril (10 mg. kg(-1). day(-1), n=9), and group ARB was administered L-NNA and candesartan (10 mg. kg(-1). day(-1), n=9). Blood pressure, plasma ANP, atrial ANP, ANP mRNA, and ANP granules were measured. A significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in group L-NNA. However, there were no increases in plasma ANP (L-NNA: 138.8+/-64.4, CONTROL: 86.7+/-36.4), ANP mRNA (L-NNA: 2.2+/-1.0, CONTROL: 1.7+/-0.5) or ANP granules (L-NNA: 61.1+/-10.2, CONTROL: 64.5+/-8.5). No increase in blood pressure was seen in groups ACEI and ARB. However, plasma ANP (ACEI: 1,392.3+/-1,034.4, ARB: 1,142.8+/-667.3), ANP mRNA (ACEI: 52.8+/-29.1, ARB: 42.9+/-21.2), and ANP granules (ACEI: 122.5+/-23.4, ARB: 136.3+/-33.2) increased significantly. NO inhibitor-induced hypertension caused no changes in ANP concentrations. However, the ACEI and ARB had a direct effect on the induction of ANP secretion. The findings suggest that ANP secretion is directly effected by ACEI and ARB, which seems to play a key role in lowering blood pressure, relieving heart failure symptoms, and preserving the myocardium.", 
    "363": "It is widely accepted that proteinuria reduction is an appropriate therapeutic goal in chronic proteinuric kidney disease. Based on large randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT), ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy have emerged as the most important antiproteinuric and renal protective interventions. However, there are numerous other interventions that have been shown to be antiproteinuric and, therefore, likely to be renoprotective. Unfortunately testing each of these antiproteinuric therapies in RCT is not feasible. The nephrologist has two choices: restrict antiproteinuric therapies to those shown to be effective in RCT or expand the use of antiproteinuric therapies to include those that, although unproven, are plausibly effective and prudent to use. The goal of this work is to provide the documentation needed for the nephrologist to choose between these strategies. This work describes 25 separate interventions that are either antiproteinuric or may block injurious mechanisms of proteinuria. Each intervention is assigned a level of recommendation (Level 1 is the highest; Level 3 is the lowest) according to the strength of the evidence supporting its antiproteinuric and renoprotective efficacy. Pathophysiologic mechanisms possibly involved are also discussed. The number of interventions at each level of recommendation are: Level 1, n = 7; Level 2, n = 9; Level 3, n = 9. Our experience indicates that we can achieve in most patients the majority of Level 1 and many of the Level 2 and 3 recommendations. We suggest that, until better information becomes available, a broad-based, multiple-risk factor intervention to reduce proteinuria can be justified in those with progressive nephropathies. This work is intended primarily for clinical nephrologists; therefore, each antiproteinuria intervention is described in practical detail.", 
    "364": "The effects of polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1) and monomeric IgA1 (mIgA1) from patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and TGF-beta synthesis were examined in cultured human mesangial cells (HMC). Both pIgA1 and mIgA1 induced renin gene expression in HMC, in a dose-dependent manner. Similar findings were observed for TGF-beta gene and protein expression. The values measured in HMC incubated with pIgA1 were significantly higher than those in HMC incubated with equivalent amounts of mIgA1. When similar experiments were performed with the addition of either captopril or losartan, there was a significant increase in the renin gene expression by HMC, whereas the synthesis of TGF-beta was markedly reduced. The TGF-beta signal transduction pathways in HMC were studied by measuring the receptor-regulated Smad proteins (Smad 2 and 3) and common-partner Smad proteins (Smad 4). pIgA1 from patients with IgAN upregulated Smad activity in HMC, and the activity observed in HMC that had been preincubated with pIgA1 was readily suppressed with optimal concentrations of captopril or losartan. The effects of pIgA1 on the RAS were further examined in HMC incubated with IgA isolated from 30 patients with IgAN, 30 healthy subjects, and disease control subjects with other diseases. pIgA1 induction of angiotensin II or TGF-beta synthesis in HMC was significantly greater with preparations from patients with IgAN, compared with healthy or disease control subjects. The findings support a pathogenetic role of pIgA1 in IgAN through upregulation of the RAS and TGF-beta, leading to chronic renal failure with renal fibrosis.", 
    "365": "Several large studies have suggested that therapy with thiazide diuretics confers a particular benefit in reducing the risk of strokes that seem to be, at least to some extent, independent of the blood pressure-lowering effect. Such a cerebroprotective effect was documented not only with monotherapy but also when diuretics were used in combination with other drugs. The cerebroprotective effect does not seem to be shared by other drug classes, such as the beta-blockers or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in patients without manifest cardiovascular disease. Since stroke is one of the most devastating sequelae of high blood pressure, our data strongly favor the use of low-dose diuretics either as initial therapy or in combination in all hypertensive patients at risk for cerebrovascular disease.", 
    "366": "Akt is known to be activated in the rheumatoid synovial tissues. We examined here functional role of Akt during tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells. Rheumatoid synovial cells in vitro were rapidly committed to apoptosis in response to TRAIL in mitochondria-dependent manner whereas Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were also phosphorylated. TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in synovial cells was significantly increased through inactivation of Akt by LY294002, however, that process was not so changed by adding ERK inhibitor, PD98059. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) clearly phosphorylated both Akt and ERK in synovial cells, and PDGF pretreatment markedly suppressed TRAIL-mediated synovial cell apoptosis. The use of not PD98059 but LY294002 abrogated PDGF-mediated inhibitory effect toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis in synovial cells. The above protective effect of Akt was confirmed by the use of short interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed inhibition of Akt. Our data suggest that Akt is an endogenous inhibitor during TRAIL-mediated synovial cell apoptotic pathway, which may explain that synovial cells in situ of the rheumatoid synovial tissues are resistant toward apoptotic cell death in spite of death receptor expression.", 
    "367": "To estimate the independent effects of kidney disease, anemia, and the treatment effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on hospitalization cost in patients with heart failure, we used data from the prevention and treatment trials of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction trial and retrospectively estimated the relative effects of decreased kidney function, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at enrollment, and anemia, as measured by hematocrit levels at enrollment, on hospital utilization and expense. Independent of the effects of age, gender, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ejection fraction, and the presence of diabetes mellitus, GFR was significantly related to hospitalization expense (percent change in hospitalization expense -16.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -11.9% to -21.5%) for GFR >/=90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) compared with GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Similarly, hematocrit levels were significantly related to hospitalization expense (percent change in hospitalization expense -19.9%, 95% CI -10.2% to -28.6%) for hematocrit >/=36% compared with hematocrit <33%). The beneficial effect of the ACE inhibitor enalapril was significantly related to hospitalization expense independent of the effects of GFR and hematocrit (percent change in hospitalization expense -6.8%, 95% CI -3.6% to -9.9% for treatment vs the placebo group), and the beneficial effect was preserved when independently estimated for subgroups with decreased kidney function. Adjusted mean expense per patient per month (PPPM) in the enalapril group was $708 versus $792 in the placebo group. Comparing survivors, enalapril generated annual cost savings greater than the average wholesale price of the drug at Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction mean dosage levels. Adjusted expected hospitalization expense varied from $636 PPPM for patients in the lowest hematocrit-GFR risk class (hematocrit >/=36%, GFR >/=90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) to $1,127 PPPM for those in the highest risk class (hematocrit <33%, GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). For patients who survived with reduced kidney function and anemia, ACE inhibitor therapy with enalapril reduced hospitalization expense more than the additional expense of the drug therapy. Thus, kidney disease and anemia are independent risk factors for hospitalization cost in patients with heart failure, and the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on hospitalization expense appears to be preserved within kidney disease and anemia subgroups.", 
    "368": "A comparative analysis of the physiological actions of native angiotensin I and angiotensin II and protein-peptide complexes of angiotensin I and angiotensin II on drinking behavior in rats was performed. The protein-peptide complexes of angiotensin I and angiotensin II had wider spectra of physiological activity than the native peptides. Protein-conjugated angiotensin I, unlike the motivationally neutral native angiotensin I, produced marked activation of innate drinking behavior in mice. The protein-peptide complex of angiotensin II showed selective effects on acquired drinking behavior. These data are assessed with respect to the specific involvement of protein-peptide complexes of angiotensin I and angiotensin II in the mechanisms of thirst motivation during the performance of innate and acquired habits.",

Trandolapril also halted the progression of glomerular damage and suppressed intragraft T-lymphocyte infiltration and reduced the expression of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).

The guidelines are knowledge based, i.e. based not only on evidence originating from clinical trials, but also from epidemiological and pathophysiological studies. A successful management strategy requires the following components: 1. Regular surveillance to detect developing hypertension and other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. 2. Considering more frequent monitoring and review of CV risk factors if any single blood pressure (BP) measurement > 140/85 mmHg (or 130/75 if microalbuminuria); when appropriate, using ambulatory or home monitoring to establish the baseline BP. 3. Considering other CV risk factors, such as a raised albumin excretion rate, in setting the intervention threshold. 4. Individualizing the target BP in accordance with other CV risk factors. 5. Agreeing lifestyle and therapeutic interventions with the patient, with education and empowerment as required. 6. Implementing lifestyle modifications, including controlling calorie, salt and alcohol intake, increased physical activity, weight control and smoking cessation. 7. Therapeutic strategy: the primary goal of therapy is to reduce BP markedly. Combination therapy is often necessary, e.g. an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a diuretic. Some classes are particularly useful for certain patients, notably longer-acting ACE inhibitors, angiotensin 2 receptor antagonists (A2RAs) and calcium antagonists in those at risk of diabetic nephropathy, loop diuretics and thiazides in those at risk of hyperkalaemia, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists (except short-acting dihydropyridines) in patients with angina, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors after a myocardial infarction or in those with left ventricular dysfunction, and thiazide diuretics and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists for isolated systolic hypertension. A2RAs should be particularly considered when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated. alpha 1-Blockers should not be considered first line in the absence of outcome data. Cost of drugs will modify these strategies in developing countries. 8. Monitoring response to therapies and, if target levels are not achieved, either intensifying drug therapy if the CV risk justifies it, or reassessing the target. 9. Maintaining a quality assurance strategy. This strategy is summarized in a simple, practical management algorithm.",

Captopril treatment during oxygen exposure is associated with a reduction in the angiogenic response at day 17 as manifested by decreased VEGF and VEGF-R2 expression in retinal tissue.

By univariate analysis, serum potassium level, use of indapamide, elderly home institutionalization and physical immobility were risk factors for thiazide-induced hyponatraemia, but gender, duration of thiazide use, concomitant therapy with loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and renal function were not. By stepwise logistic regression analysis, patient age, body weight and serum potassium were the only independent predictive factors. Each 10-year increment of age was associated with a two-fold increase in risk (hazards ratio 2.14, 95%CI 1.59-2.88). For a 5 kg increment in mass, there was a 27% decrease in odds ratio (odds ratio 0.77, 95%CI 0.68-0.87).

Blood pressure (BP) was elevated significantly in NO-deficient SHRs (rats receiving L-NAME) or significantly lower in enalapril-treated SHRs. Co-administration of L-NAME and enalapril caused a 20% decrease in BP compared with untreated SHRs. NO-deficient SHRs had a decrease in body mass, but this loss of body mass was prevented efficiently in the enalapril-treated group. Enalapril treatment decreased the left ventricular (LV) mass index in SHRs, even in animals with NO synthesis blocked. NO deficiency in SHRs caused a larger decrease in the number of LV cardiomyocyte nuclei, which had a negative correlation with both LV mass index and BP. The volume-weighted glomerular volume (VWGV) separated the SHRs into two groupings: (i) control and NO-deficient SHRs, and (ii) enalapril- and L-NAME plus enalapril-treated SHRs. There was a significant difference between these two groupings, with VWGV being more than 15% smaller in the latter compared with the former grouping. The present findings reinforce the evidence that enalapril efficiently treats genetic hypertension, and demonstrate that this effect is observed even when NO synthesis is inhibited. Enalapril administration also decreases cardiac and renal structural damage caused by genetic hypertension, as well as by the interaction between genetic hypertension and NO deficiency.",

All patients with heart failure need education about the importance of sodium restriction and daily weight monitoring. Most patients with heart failure require combination therapy that includes a diuretic, an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and digoxin. Selected patients may benefit from alternative or additional medications, such as anticoagulants in individuals with atrial fibrillation or ARBs in those who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitor therapy. Investigational medications and devices for heart failure are under active study.", 
    "416": "One of the current challenges in the treatment of hypertension is the variation in the incidence and morbidity among ethnic populations. For example, in the recent Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), in which 35% of the patients were African American, the diuretic chlorthalidone was associated with greater reductions in blood pressure (BP) than the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and was also associated with a relative risk reduction in stroke compared with lisinopril. However, the increased stroke risk associated with lisinopril was experienced among African American but not non-African American patients. ALLHAT did not permit combination therapy with ACE inhibitors plus diuretics; therefore, the benefits of such regimens in this patient population could not be assessed. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, in contrast to the overall study population, African American patients with left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol were at lower risk of experiencing the primary composite end point (death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) than African Americans treated with losartan, with or without diuretics. On the other hand, in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, African American patients treated with the ACE inhibitor ramipril had a significantly lower incidence of the primary composite end point (glomerular filtration rate reduction, end-stage renal disease, or death) than African Americans treated with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Although the use of diuretics in African American patients may be a logical first-line choice for BP reduction, most patients will require combination therapy. African American patients with systolic BP > or =15 mm Hg above target level or a diastolic BP > or =10 mm Hg above target should be considered for first-line combination therapy. Although certain combinations have been shown to be effective in non-African American patients, the choice of drugs for combination therapy in African American patients may be different.", 
    "417": "During the past decade, the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has risen dramatically, primarily due to an increase in the incidence of diabetes. In patients with diabetes, both hyperglycemia and hypertension are independent risk factors for renal disease. Hypertension is also a risk factor in nondiabetic renal disease and contributes to renal dysfunction by increasing glomerular pressure, glomerular capillary damage, and proteinuria. The resultant nephron damage increases glomerular pressure and damage within remnant functional nephrons, further contributing to deterioration of renal function. In addition to its role in systemic hypertension, angiotensin II has direct effects on the kidney through elevation of glomerular capillary pressure and upregulation of components of the renal injury response. These direct effects of angiotensin II on the kidney support the inclusion of agents that target the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) into treatment regimens for patients at risk for renal disease. Several clinical trials have established the benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with diabetes. The ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay renal decline in patients with type 1 diabetes, whereas the renoprotective effect of these agents in patients with type 2 diabetes is less clear. The ARBs have been shown to provide significant benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes, both at early (microalbuminuria) and late (proteinuria) stages of renal decline. In the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) and the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study, ARB therapy significantly reduced the progression of overt nephropathy (composite of doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, and death), a benefit that has not been shown for ACE inhibitors. Moreover, in RENAAL, losartan significantly reduced the incidence of the individual end point of ESRD. The benefits of ARB therapy in IDNT and RENAAL were associated with significant reductions in proteinuria and were independent of blood pressure reductions. In RENAAL, proteinuria was a strong predictor of both renal and cardiovascular events. These findings underscore the importance of RAS blockade as a strategy for improving clinical outcomes in patients with renal disease.", 
    "418": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major causes of mortality in persons with diabetes, and many factors, including hypertension, contribute to this high prevalence of CVD. The incidence of hypertension in patients with diabetes is approximately twofold higher than in age-matched subjects without the disease, and conversely, individuals with hypertension are at increased risk of developing diabetes compared with normotensive persons. Furthermore, because up to 75% of cases of CVD in patients with diabetes can be attributed to hypertension, aggressive management of elevated blood pressure (BP) (ie, to <130/85 mm Hg) in these patients is essential for reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The renin-angiotensin system is an important regulator of both BP and obesity, and its pharmacologic modulation may thus translate into significant cardiovascular benefits. Apart from hypertension and obesity, the important risk factors for CVD in patients with diabetes include atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, endothelial dysfunction, platelet hyperaggregability, and coagulation abnormalities. Therefore, effective prevention of major cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes requires combination therapy with agents that target key factors contributing to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin, the lipid-lowering activity of statins, as well as the antihypertensive effects of various agents (eg, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-II receptor blockers) have all been demonstrated to provide substantial reductions in cardiovascular events.", 
    "419": "The antihypertensive drug classes that have reduced cardiovascular events safely either in large placebo-controlled trials or in comparison with other effective antihypertensive drugs in large morbidity trials are diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Although control of blood pressure (BP) is a primary goal of therapy, evidence from several clinical trials suggests that certain antihypertensive agents provide clinical benefits independent of their effect on BP. In the recently reported Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), an ACE inhibitor, a CCB, and an alpha-blocker reduced coronary events and mortality to a similar extent as a thiazide-type diuretic, but the diuretic reduced one or more major cardiovascular events, especially heart failure, more than the other agents. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) trial, the ARB losartan reduced cardiovascular morbidity (primarily stroke) more than the beta-blocker atenolol. Although an ARB has not yet been compared with a diuretic in a morbidity trial, as most patients require more than one drug to control BP, and a diuretic plus an ARB is a very effective and well-tolerated combination, this uncertainty applies to a minority of patients. A primary goal in treating hypertension should be to reach a patient's goal BP, but initial selection of drugs based on hypertension morbidity study results and other compelling indications should be given priority.", 
    "420": "In addition to their hypotensive action, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert a beneficial effect on glucoregulation. In the present study, the effect of ACE inhibition by captopril on glucose utilization in peripheral tissues was investigated in non-obese rats with hereditary hypertriglyceridemia (HHTg) associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Normotriglyceridemic Wistar rats served as controls (C). Rats of both groups received a high-sucrose diet, and a half of each group also captopril in drinking water (10 mg/kg body weight [bw]) for 2 weeks. Captopril administration reduced fasting glycemia and postprandial triglyceridemia in HHTg rats, while the fasting levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), glycerol, and lactate were decreased in both groups. The sensitivity of skeletal muscle to insulin action evaluated as in vitro 14C-glucose incorporation into glycogen was significantly increased by captopril treatment both in HHTg (3.51 +/- 0.48 v 2.0 +/- 0.12 micromol glucose/g wet weight [ww]) and C (3.32 +/- 0.21 v 2.48 +/- 0.09 micromol glucose/g ww). In isolated adipose tissue, the insulin-stimulated 14C-glucose incorporation into neutral lipids was increased, after captopril administration, by 137% in C and by 35% only in HHTg. After captopril treatment, insulin-stimulated de novo fatty acid synthesis rose significantly in C while remaining low in HHTg. The increase in esterification was comparable in both groups. Separate experiments were designed to assess the possible involvement of bradykinin in mediating captopril action. Both C and HHTg rats fed a high-sucrose diet for 2 weeks were treated with captopril (50 mg/kg orally) for 1 hour; half of each group received the specific inhibitor of bradykinin receptor HOE-140 (100 microg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.]) 1 hour before captopril administration. In C, captopril administration enhanced the insulin-stimulated in vitro glucose incorporation into lipids in adipose tissue by 255%, and into glycogen in the musculus soleus by 45%; this effect was eliminated by HOE-140. In HHTg, neither a single dose of captopril nor HOE-140 had any effect. We conclude that long-term captopril administration increased the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissue in both C and HHTg rats, but with different efficacy. While the insulin-sensitizing action of captopril on skeletal muscle was comparable in HHTg and C rats, there were differences in the effect of captopril on adipose tissue. The difference became particularly manifest in de novo fatty acid synthesis.", 
    "421": "Atherosclerosis is a very complex disease. Although it is thought that hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, and other conditions such as high blood pressure are mainly responsible for the development of atherosclerosis, many other factors such as endothelial dysfunction and inflammation play a significant role in its pathology. The clinicians should be aware of all the contributing factors to optimize the therapy for atherosclerosis. A combination of lifestyle modification, nutritional measures, and pharmacological intervention with statins or fibrates would achieve good results if the treatment of atherosclerosis were pursued vigorously. In the presence of hypertension, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers would be more appropriate.", 
    "422": "Hypertension is a very common condition and the most important risk factor for the occurrence of cardiovascular events. The hyperactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is considered a cardiovascular risk factor in subjects with essential hypertension. The intrinsic vascular abnormality in which the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is clearly the milieu for the development of the pathologic changes in blood vessel walls is one of the causes of the establishment of hypertension. Many drugs with different mechanisms of action have been used for the treatment of hypertension and its vascular complications. Nevertheless, the utilities of many drugs are limited by their adverse effects. Continuous research in the search for new pharmacological agents for the treatment of hypertension has led to the development of angiotensin II receptor type AT1 blockers. The most important functions mediated by AT1 receptors include: vasoconstriction, induction of the production and release of aldosterone, renal reabsorption of sodium, cardiac cellular growth, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle, increase of peripheral noradrenergic action and the central activity of the sympathetic nervous system, stimulation of vasopressin release, and inhibition of renin release from the kidney. The angiotensin II receptor type AT1 blockers inhibit the interaction of angiotensin II with its AT1 receptor. These agents lower blood pressure without producing cough as a side effect since, unlike the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors they do not influence the levels of bradykinin or substance P. Hence, these drugs are suitable for the treatment of hypertensive patients who require therapy with a drug blocking the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme but cannot use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors due to cough as a side effect.", 
    "423": "Recent research has demonstrated that ambulatory BP is a superior means to predict cardiovascular outcomes in treated patients with hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has been utilized to evaluate the efficacy of all anti-hypertensive drugs including the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). This paper reviews the relationship of clinic and ambulatory blood pressures to cardiovascular outcomes and the benefits of ARBs to maximize improvement in clinical end-points in patients with hypertension. Clinical trial evidence has demonstrated that ARBs are a preferred class in patients with electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, in patients with type 2 diabetes, patients with chronic kidney disease, and in individuals with heart failure who have clinically relevant intolerability to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In addition, there is increasing evidence from clinical trials that many of the ARBs provide adequate 24 h blood pressure control alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensive agents. We conclude that the combination of event reduction from large-scale clinical trials, adequate 24 h BP reduction, and improved tolerability compared to most other classes of anti-hypertensive agents, make the ARBs a suitable initial treatment for patients with hypertension.", 
    "424": "Recently published guidelines from the ESC and practical recommendations from an international group of experts support the up-titration of ACE inhibitors at 1- to 2-week intervals.

The average time to titration to final dose was 5.5+/-4.2 days. Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly from 132+/-28 mmHg on admission to 117+/-18 mmHg on discharge. Mean baseline urea, creatinine and potassium did not change from admission to discharge (urea 8.4+/-2.5 to 9.2+/-3.9 mmol/l, P=0.15; creatinine 122.7+/-30.3 to 122.4+/-35.4 micromol/l, P=0.93; potassium 4.0+/-0.5 to 4.0+/-0.3 mEq/l, P=0.86).

Recent studies have suggested that hypertension is a risk factor for the development and progression of DR and that blood pressure reduction can delay the progression of retinopathy. The renin-angiotensin system is activated by chronic hyperglycaemia, and the vitreous fluid level of angiotensin II (AII) is elevated in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema. AII increases vascular permeability and promotes neovascularization. It has been suggested that an autocrine-paracrine relationship may exist between AII and vascular endothelial growth factor in the ocular tissues. Accordingly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or AII Type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers may be useful therapeutic agents for preventing the progression of DR.", 
    "434": "Three patients who suffered from congestive heart failure caused by severe hypertension were treated with a combination therapy consisting of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Before initiation of treatment, all three patients showed elevations of serum creatinine concentration (sCr), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), which indicated insufficient blood supply to the kidney during exacerbation of hypertension. All three cases successfully recovered from hypertensive heart failure with the combination therapy. sCr gradually decreased during continuation of the therapy, although one patient showed an increase in sCr at an early stage of the combination therapy. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by the combination of ACEI and ARB was well tolerated in patients with severe hypertension with renal damage and showed a beneficial effect in protecting against further renal damage. This result suggests that combination therapy with ACEI and ARB should be considered as a candidate treatment in cases of severe hypertension.", 
    "435": "Previous studies have demonstrated that integrins link the extracellular matrix to the hypertrophic response pathway of cardiac myocytes in vitro. To examine the direct relation between integrin beta1 and cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, we studied the effects of a newly developed angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) blocker, CS866 (ARB; 10 mg/kg/day), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, temocapril (ACEI, 10 mg/kg/day), or both on modulation of integrin beta1 in the hypertrophied hearts of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) 6 to 12 weeks of age. Treatments with ARB, ACEI, and combination therapy significantly reduced systolic blood pressure. However, the reduction in cardiac hypertrophy was greater in SHRSP treated with ARB or combination therapy than in those treated with ACEI. Multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed significantly higher mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor, AT1 receptor, and integrin beta1 in untreated SHRSP than in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The mRNA levels of ANP, AT1 receptor, and integrin B1 in SHRSP were significantly decreased by treatment with ARB, ACEI, or combination therapy. Decreased mRNA expression of ANP, AT1 receptor, and integrin beta1 in the treated SHRSP was associated with reductions in blood pressure; ARB and combination therapy produced greater decreases in expression than did ACEI. These observations suggest that CS866 has a beneficial effect on myocyte hypertrophy and that down-regulation of AT1 receptor and suppression of integrin beta1 participate in the regression of pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. The correlation between the expression of integrin beta1 and AT1 receptor was significant. Our results also suggest that integrin expression by myocytes might be modulated by angiotensin II via AT1 receptor.", 
    "436": "Hypertension is often accompanied by type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recently, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) published guidelines on the treatment of hypertension in adult patients with diabetes mellitus. However, the views of general physicians on how to control blood pressure (BP) in diabetic patients and the impact of the ADA guidelines in Japan are still not known. We conducted an internet survey in May 2002: Questionnaires were e-mailed to a total of 3,616 medical doctors, of whom 441 (12.2%) properly responded. About half of the respondents (48.3%) had already read the ADA guidelines. Before being given an outline of the guidelines, the respondents' average BP level for starting medication was 152/94 mmHg, and the BP goal 133/83 mmHg; after reading the outline, these values were 149/92 and 132/82 mmHg, respectively. The goal BP decreased more after reading the guidelines in doctors who had not previously read the ADA guidelines than in those who had already read. After being given an outline of the ADA guidelines, 40.3% of respondents reported that they would select, as a first-line agent, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB), 35.6% an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and 18.6% a calcium channel blocker (CCB); as a second-line medication, 39.7% of the respondents would select a CCB. Seventy percent of doctors reported having at least one patient receiving CCB monotherapy; after reading the guidelines, 41.5% of these doctors said they would continue CCB monotherapy, 36.6% said they would add an ACEI or ARB, and 29.7% planned to change to an ACEI or ARB. In conclusion, our data suggest the impact of the ADA guidelines on the target BP and the first choice of antihypertensive medication in diabetic patients. ARBs and ACEIs became first-line medications, and CCBs became second-line medications to achieve the BP goal and prevent organ damage.",

As cardiac function worsens, ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and end-stage heart disease are the ultimate consequences. Underlying mechanisms include myocardial stretch and neurohormonal and cytokine activation. Consequently, therapies aiming counteracting these mechanisms have proven successful in attenuating or even preventing cardiac remodeling. In particular, ACE inhibition, beta-blockade and aldosterone antagonism have proven to be effective in modulating the process of remodeling and in reducing the occurrence of adverse events in heart failure. Of interest, although several other antagonists of neurohormonal, including endothelin, or of cytokine activation have been shown to effectively modulate remodeling, studies thus far have been negative in terms of event reduction in heart failure. Whereas insight in cardiovascular remodeling has already significantly contributed to existing management strategies in heart failure, further studies in different mechanisms may provide additional therapeutic measures.",

The present study was performed to investigate whether brain ANG II contributes to the fever and IL-1beta production in the rat brain induced by i.c.v. injection of LPS. LPS (0.2 and 2 microg i.c.v.) induced dose-related fevers and increases in the brain (hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum) concentrations of IL-1beta. These effects were significantly inhibited by i.c.v. administration of either an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist. By contrast, the ACE inhibitor had no effect on the IL-1beta (i.c.v.)-induced fever, whereas the AT(1) receptor antagonist enhanced (rather than reduced) it. The AT(1) receptor antagonist had no effect on the brain levels of prostaglandin E(2) in rats given an i.c.v. injection of IL-1beta. These results suggest that in rats, brain ANG II and AT(1) receptors are involved in the LPS-induced production of brain IL-1beta, thus contributing to the fever induced by the presence of LPS within the brain.",

The possible role of ACE/RAS in BM was investigated by evaluating ACE expression in normal BM, several myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplasia. Immunohistochemical studies showed that erythroid elements expressed ACE protein in both normal and disturbed haematopoiesis.

The aim of this study was to explore whether among hospitalized hypertensive patients use of ACE inhibitors may reduce the risk of headache caused by nitrates. To this end, we used the GIFA database, that includes patients admitted to academic medical centres throughout Italy. We studied 1537 patients (mean age 75 +/- 10 years) receiving treatment with nitrates during a hospital stay and diagnosed with hypertension. Headaches that had a probable or definite causal relation with nitrates use based on the Naranjo algorithm were considered for this analysis. Of the total enrolled sample, 762 patients (50%) used ACE inhibitors during hospital stay. Headache caused by nitrates was recorded in 12/762 (1.6%) ACE inhibitor users and in 24/775 (3.2%) other participants (P = 0.049). After adjusting for potential confounders, ACE inhibitors use was associated with a significantly lower risk of headache (OR 0.43; 95% Confidence Intervals: 0.20-0.90). This result was confirmed if ACE inhibitors use was compared with use of other antihypertensive agents (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.20-0.95).

    "461": "Not all of the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can be attributed to changes in angiotensin II and bradykinin levels. Because the cytoplasmic tail of ACE is phosphorylated, we determined whether ACE inhibitors affect the phosphorylation of ACE and whether ACE possesses the characteristics of a signal transduction molecule. The ACE inhibitors ramiprilat and perindoprilat, and the substrate bradykinin (but not angiotensin I), enhanced the activity of ACE-associated CK2 and the phosphorylation of ACE Ser1270 in cultured endothelial cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) coprecipitated with ACE, and stimulation of endothelial cells with ACE inhibitors increased the activity of ACE-associated JNK and elicited the accumulation of phosphorylated c-Jun in the nucleus. Ramiprilat was however unable to activate JNK or to stimulate the nuclear accumulation of c-Jun in endothelial cells expressing a S1270A ACE mutant or in ACE-deficient cells. Because the ACE inhibitor-induced increase in ACE expression has been linked to the formation of c-Jun homodimers, we investigated whether ACE signaling via JNK contributes to this response in vitro and in vivo. Prolonged ramiprilat treatment increased ACE expression in primary cultures of human endothelial cells and in vivo (mouse lung), a response that was prevented by pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Thus, ACE is involved in outside-in signaling in endothelial cells and \"ACE signaling\" may be an important cellular mechanism contributing to the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors.",

Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines estimate that 16.6 million Americans currently have stable angina. Chronic stable angina is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, thus highlighting the need for accurate and early detection and treatment. Clinical examination is the single most important step in evaluating risk. Age, sex, pain type, coexisting diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or known vascular disease are powerful predictors of prognosis and, except for special patient groups, are more reliable than ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, or electron-beam computed tomography. Cost-effective methods for screening the general population for \"silent\" risk factors predisposing them to atherosclerotic disease in later life are nevertheless required. Aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents are currently the backbone of pharmacologic therapy, supplemented by lifestyle changes aimed at promoting exercise, weight reduction, and increased fruit and vegetable intake. However, side effects of chronic drug treatment, especially for those taking multidrug regimens, may affect quality of life and are the principal reason for poor compliance. Coronary bypass surgery and angioplasty are frequently used interventional procedures for CAD, although they can be invasive and costly, and they often need to be repeated. Current options for the management of CAD have their limitations, thus confirming the appropriateness of continuing the search for improved therapies to reverse the disease process and reduce the global burden.",

In patients with congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may inhibit aldosterone production. Spironolactone, a specific aldosterone receptor antagonist may exert other independent and additive effects to those of ACE inhibitors. Given the consequences of aldosterone on ischemic hearts, we evaluated the protective effects of spironolactone or lisinopril and combined spironolactone-lisinopril therapy during low-flow ischemia and reperfusion in isolated rat hearts. Normal and infarcted (left coronary artery ligature) male Wistar rats were submitted to chronic action of drugs (0.8 mg.kg-1.day-1 for lisinopril and 8 or 50 mg.kg-1.day-1 for spironolactone) for 1 month. Hearts were rapidly excised and perfused (constant pressure) for a 40-min period of stabilization followed by a 25-min period of global low-flow ischemia and a 30-min reperfusion. In normal rats, spironolactone decreased ischemic and reperfusion contracture, reduced ventricular tachycardia, suppressed action-potential duration dispersion, and increased reactive hyperemia leading to an improvement of contractile recovery. Lisinopril also decreased ventricular tachycardia and action-potential duration dispersion concomitantly with increased reactive hyperemia and better contractile recovery. These beneficial effects of the drugs were lost when the two treatments were combined (lisinopril and 50 mg.kg-1.day-1 spironolactone), despite a synergistic effect on plasmatic K+ and Mg2+. However, an interaction between the ACE inhibitor and spironolactone potentiating the effects of either drug alone was observed with a lower dose of spironolactone (lisinopril and 8 mg.kg-1.day-1 spironolactone). Similar beneficial effects have been noted in infarcted rat hearts on reactive hyperemia, ventricular tachycardia, and contractile recovery with the combined treatment and for both spironolactone concentrations (8 or 50 mg). Chronic spironolactone treatment produces similar beneficial effects to ACE inhibitor treatment on normal rat hearts during an ischemia-reperfusion protocol. Synergistic effects have been observed with the combined therapy when a lower dose of spironolactone was utilized in normal and infarcted rats. However, in the case of a high dose of spironolactone, the two effective drugs seem to cancel each other but only in normal rats.",

The aim of the current study in diabetic patients with normal renal function to various degrees of proteinuric nephropathy was therefore to unravel a possible role of the most important isoform VEGF(165) for albuminuria and to investigate the impact of therapy with an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system on VEGF(165) secretion.",

Twenty-six healthy volunteers (17 female, 9 male, mean age 34.8 years, range 19-58) with normal renal function served as controls. Serum and urinary VEGF(165) was measured by ELISA. Urinary albumin was measured nephelometrically. Mann Whitney U tests were used for comparisons.",

The respective mean urinary albumin concentrations were 443 +/- 1029, 394 +/- 749 and 20 +/- 33 mg/l (p < 0.01 vs. diabetics type 2). There was a correlation between urinary VEGF and albumin, but only in patients with type 2 diabetes (R = 0.497; n = 36; p = 0.002). Urinary VEGF(165) was similar in patients with (n = 40) and without ACE inhibitor/AT1 antagonist therapy (n = 32) and in normal volunteers, whereas serum VEGF(165) was higher in the treated type 1 diabetics.",

BP was measured weekly by tail plethysmography. After 3 weeks, animals were sacrificed and cardiac, aortic and mesenteric artery morphology was evaluated using morphometric and stereological techniques.",

Only the ACE-i but not the ET(A)-RB prevented structural changes of small intramyocardial arteries and of the aorta.", 
    "506": "Oxidative stress contributes to the pathophysiology of kidney injury. Beneficial renal effects of some medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and lipid lowering agents depend at least partially on the ability to alleviate oxidative stress. The administration of various natural or synthetic antioxidants has been shown to be of benefit in prevention and attenuation of renal scaring in numerous animal models of kidney diseases. These include vitamins, N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid, melatonin, dietary flavonoids and phytoestrogens, and many others. Human studies are limited in this regard. Under certain conditions, surprisingly, the antioxidant supplements may exhibit pro-oxidant properties and even worsen renal damage. To date, the evidence is insufficient to recommend antioxidant supplements in patients with kidney disease. Prospective, controlled clinical trials on safety and effectiveness of different therapeutic antioxidant strategies are indispensable.", 
    "507": "Pathologic hemorheological parameters and increased platelet aggregation in association with other risk factors significantly increase the possibility of the development of myocardial ischemia. Hemorheological parameters and platelet aggregation were investigated in 157 patients (mean age: 65+/-12 years) with acute coronary syndromes and in 68 healthy subjects (mean age: 36+/-6 years). Plasma fibrinogen, plasma and whole blood viscosity, red blood cell aggregation and filterability and platelet aggregation were measured in the hospital phase (after admission, on 2nd and 6th days) and monitored after discharge (at 1, 6 and 12 months). After admission all these parameters were significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (p<0.01) and almost all of them remained in the pathologic range at discharge. Some of the rheologic parameters showed a slight improvement after 1 month, but hematocrit and whole blood viscosity were higher than those after admission and of control subjects (p<0.05). After 6 and 12 months these parameters showed a small, but significant increase. Pathologically altered hemorheological parameters could be observed in patients with classical cardiovascular risk factors and significant improvement was found after elimination of them. Antiplatelet therapy was efficient in about half of the treated patients after admission; and despite a significant improvement, the proportion of ineffectively treated patients was still considerable during the follow-up. Our results support the role of abnormal hemorheological parameters in the development of myocardial ischemia and draw attention to the rheologic risk of these patients. The results of platelet aggregation measurements show the insufficiency of antiplatelet therapy at some cases and confirm the importance of guided secondary prevention.",

The upper limit of the one-sided 97.5 percent confidence interval for the comparison of the valsartan group with the captopril group was within the prespecified margin for noninferiority with regard to mortality (P=0.004) and with regard to the composite end point of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (P<0.001).

    "512": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homologue of ACE, represents a new and potentially important target in cardio-renal disease. A model of the active site of ACE2, based on the crystal structure of testicular ACE, has been developed and indicates that the catalytic mechanism of ACE2 resembles that of ACE. Structural differences exist between the active site of ACE (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase) and ACE2 (carboxypeptidase) that are responsible for the differences in specificity. The main differences occur in the ligand-binding pockets, particularly at the S2' subsite and in the binding of the peptide carboxy-terminus. The model explains why the classical ACE inhibitor lisinopril is unable to bind to ACE2. On the basis of the ability of ACE2 to cleave a variety of biologically active peptides, a consensus sequence of Pro-X-Pro-hydrophobic/basic for the protease specificity of ACE2 has been defined that is supported by the ACE2 model. The dipeptide, Pro-Phe, completely inhibits ACE2 activity at 180 microM with angiotensin II as the substrate. As with ACE, the chloride dependence of ACE2 is substrate-specific such that the hydrolysis of angiotensin I and the synthetic peptide substrate, Mca-APK(Dnp), are activated in the presence of chloride ions, whereas the cleavage of angiotensin II is inhibited. The ACE2 model is also suggestive of a possible mechanism for chloride activation. The structural insights provided by these analyses for the differences in inhibition pattern and substrate specificity among ACE and its homologue ACE2 and for the chloride dependence of ACE/ACE2 activity are valuable in understanding the function and regulation of ACE2.", 
    "513": "The effect of the flavonoid quercetin on substance P- and bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation in rat tissues (duodenum, heart, pancreas, trachea and urinary bladder) was studied, and its modulation by endogenous peptidases. Plasma protein extravasation was assayed by extravasated Evans blue dye. Intravenous injection of substance P (1, 3 and 10 nmol/kg) increased the plasma extravasation in a dose-dependent manner in heart, pancreas, trachea and urinary bladder. Bradykinin (3 and 10 nmol/kg, i.v.) increased plasma extravasation in a dose-dependent manner in duodenum, pancreas, trachea and urinary bladder. Pre-treatment with a selected dose of quercetin potentiated the substance P-induced plasma extravasation in heart, pancreas and urinary bladder, and also the bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation in duodenum, heart, trachea and urinary bladder. The selective pharmacological inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme potentiated the substance P- and bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation, respectively; furthermore, treatment with receptor antagonists showed that the mediators involved in the potentiation of plasma extravasation by quercetin are substance P and bradykinin. Analysis of plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity demonstrated that quercetin inhibited this enzyme. These results suggest that quercetin potentiates plasma extravasation induced by substance P and bradykinin, and that this may result from inhibition of the degradative enzymes of these peptides.",

Consecutive purification methods were used for peptide isolation including ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of this peptide was identified as Ile-Ala-Pro, and the ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value) was 2.7 microM. The hypotensive activity of Ile-Ala-Pro on spontaneously hypertensive rats was investigated.

Evidence-based medicine provides clinicians with the best armamentarium to provide high quality and cost-effective care to patients diagnosed with this chronic, progressive, and debilitating condition.

The aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate whether the two alternative drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists, had comparable effects on glucose metabolism and endothelial function. 2) to determine whether they improve endothelial dysfunction through modulating insulin resistance and oxidative stress.",

Endothelial dysfunction is triggered by cardiovascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, adiposity and smoking, contributing to the common endpoint of atherosclerosis. This study examined the pharmacological effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and combined ACE-neutral endopeptidase (NEP) (vasopeptidase) inhibitors on endothelial dysfunction in the model of hyperlipidaemic rabbits. The focus of the study was to assess endothelial function after treatment with the ACE-NEP inhibitor AVE 7688 (30 mg/kg/day) in comparison to the ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) ramipril (1 mg/kg/day). Different parameters, such as endothelial function, blood pressure (BP), expansion of plaques, endothelial nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2-) release and plasma levels of various lipidaemic parameters were analysed. Control groups consisted of one group fed only with normal diet, one group fed only with atherogenic diet and the direct control group fed with varied diets (six weeks atherogenic diet followed by 12 weeks normal diet). Since for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a change in feeding is absolutely necessary, in the present study, at the start of the treatments with AVE 7688 and ramipril, the rabbits food was changed to a normal diet. At the end of the study, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was measured in the anaesthetised animals. The values in standard, atherogenic and varied diet-fed rabbits were around 73 2 mmHg. Angiotensin I (Ang I) given intravenous (i.v.) induced a strong increase in MAP of about 20%. In both the treated groups Ang I-induced BP increase was inhibited. In contrast, i.v. bradykinin led to a strong reduction in MAP in both the treated groups of around 50%. Six weeks feeding with an atherogenic diet in the rabbits induced an enduring endothelial dysfunction despite the food subsequently being changed to a normal chow. All measured parameters indicated a significant favourable effect on endothelial dysfunction as a result of the two treatment regimens. Endothelial function measured in the organ chamber showed somewhat greater improvement in the ACE-NEP treated group than in the ACE-I treated group. The treatment with ramipril, as well as with AVE 7688, restored endothelial function by increasing the ratio of NO to O2- concentration and bioavailability of NO. In this study, a similar protective effect on endothelial function was shown by ACE-NEP inhibition as already seen with ACE inhibitors in an animal model of atherosclerosis.", 
    "521": "A markedly decreased aortic nitric oxide (NO) availability, probably due to impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity with enhanced O2- and peroxynitrite production, seems to be attributable to endothelial dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). In this study, we investigated the chronic effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril (RA) and the loop diuretic, frusemide (FU), as well as the combination of both on endothelial NO, O2- and peroxynitrite production in aortae from SHR with failing hearts after myocardial infarction (MI). Heart failure was induced by permanent occlusion of the left coronary artery. SHR were randomised to receive either placebo, RA, (1 mg/kg/day), FU (4 mg/kg/day) or RA+FU (1 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively). Treatments were started two weeks following MI and continued for six weeks. Reduced aortic and coronary flow indices in the working heart, which can be considered as markers for endothelial function, were significantly normalised and improved, respectively, by RA, FU or RA+FU-treatment. Similarly, all three treatment regimens significantly enhanced the reduced calcium ionophore (CaI)-induced NO-release (assessed by a NO-sensitive microsensor) from aortic endothelial cells of placebo-treated animals with CHF. Concomitantly, the increased CaI-stimulated O2- production (assessed by an electrochemical sensor) in aortic endothelial cells of placebo-treated animals with CHF was significantly reduced by RA and RA+FU-treatment. Treatment with RA and RA+FU also attenuated the dramatic increase in endothelial peroxynitrite concentration (chemiluminescence method), which was observed in placebo-treated rats with CHF. FU did not counteract improved haemo- and cardiodynamic parameters by RA. Thus, RA and FU act synergistically to enhance bioavailability of endothelium-derived NO, and this may contribute to the clinical usefulness of the combination of these drugs in treatment of heart failure.",

    "523": "We have previously shown a chronic, hypotensive response to the AT(1)-receptor antagonist, losartan, in normotensive rats. The mechanism of this response is not completely understood. Previous studies by others have demonstrated a role for Ang (1-7) in the beneficial antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. This is thought to be due to vasodilatory effects of increased levels of Ang (1-7) during ACE inhibition. Since it has now been shown that Ang (1-7) levels are also increased during AT(1) antagonism, we designed experiments to test the hypothesis above.", 
    "524": "Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented with venous catheters and radiotelemetric pressure transducers and commenced on a normal (0.4%) NaCl diet.

    "527": "Collectively, a series of large, prospective randomised outcome trials has now shown that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are of clinical value in a broad spectrum of patients with symptomatic heart failure, regardless of background therapy and ventricular function. There is a clear benefit of ARBs in patients unable to tolerate an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and this benefit is of a similar magnitude to that obtained with an ACE inhibitor (ACE-I). Both Val-HeFT and, particularly, CHARM-Added, also show that symptoms, morbidity and mortality are further reduced if an ARB is added to an ACE-I. This benefit is not only statistically significant but clinically important. CHARM-Preserved showed that candesartan can reduce hospital admission for heart failure in patients with preserved systolic function though more definitive outcome data are needed in this group.", 
    "528": "The development of new-onset diabetes is frequent during the follow-up of treated hypertensive patients. The prevalence of such an event seems to differ depending on the type of antihypertensive therapy used to control blood pressure. Diuretics and b-blockers and their association are particularly harmful in this regard. On the contrary, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, alone or in association with diuretics, are associated with a lower prevalence of this metabolic complication. These statements are confirmed by data from the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study. Long-term studies are required to determine the relevance of development of new-onset diabetes in treated hypertensive patients.", 
    "529": "Increased understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases has shown that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated in this setting and suggests a central role for the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE transforms angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II), and also promotes the degradation of bradykinin into inactive metabolites. These bradykinins stimulate nitric oxide synthesis and vasodilatator prostaglandin synthesis via a cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. COX inhibitors may therefore be deleterious in cardiovascular disease and/or counteract part of ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) efficacy. This has been clearly demonstrated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including high-dose aspirin, in hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure (CHF); most guidelines recommend avoiding their use in such patients. Theoretically, this effect is dose-mediated and the existence of an identical deleterious effect with low-dose aspirin has been an area of intense debate. In this article, we review studies, most of them conducted in CHF, that pointed out such a possible deleterious effect and a counteraction of ACE-Is with low-dose aspirin, using various criteria of assessment. However, there are no prospective long-term studies that have validated such an effect, and the role of other anti-aggregating agents has not been evaluated. Until such studies are published, the use of low-dose aspirin (100 mg/day) in such patients can be recommended.", 
    "530": "Conventional diuretic agents are very effective agents in relieving volume overload and congestive symptoms in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, they are associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the sympathetic nervous system and a reduction in glomerular filtration rate, all of which have been associated with adverse outcomes in CHF. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in drugs that target the natriuretic system without neurohormonal activation and deterioration of renal function. In this review, we will discuss the underlying rationale and evidence behind currently pursued strategies that target the natriuretic system. This includes the administration of natriuretic peptides (NPs) and strategies that potentiate the NP system, such as neutral endopeptidase inhibition. We will also highlight some potentially important interactions of these strategies with drugs that target the RAS.", 
    "531": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system contributes to the progression of heart failure and its inhibition slows ventricular remodelling and favourably affects morbidity and mortality. beta-blockers exert a remarkably favourable effect on progression that may be mediated at least in part by renin inhibition. Although earlier trials suggested a possible adverse interaction when an angiotensin receptor blocker was added to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a beta-blocker, a recent study and newly analysed mechanistic data indicate that the triple combination provides modest additional inhibition of angiotensin that can further slow progression of disease.", 
    "532": "Following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), patients remain at risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease progression, cardiovascular events and mortality. There is compelling scientific evidence that antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and lipid-lowering therapy reduce cardiovascular events, hospitalizations and mortality in patients after PCI. Despite this evidence and national guidelines, a number of studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of post-PCI patients are not receiving treatment with these guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapies when guided by conventional care. The demonstration that initiation of cardiovascular protective medications, including lipid-lowering therapy, prior to hospital discharge for cardiovascular events and/or procedures results in a marked increase in treatment rates, improved long-term patient compliance and better clinical outcomes has led to the revision of national guidelines to endorse this approach as the standard of care. Hospital-based cardiovascular performance improvement programs have demonstrated substantial improvements in treatment rates as well as the quality of PCI and other coronary heart disease patient care. Adopting in-hospital initiation of cardiovascular protective medications as the standard of care for patients undergoing PCI could dramatically improve treatment rates and thus substantially reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events, reduce hospitalizations and prolong life in the large number of patients undergoing PCI each year.",

The time constant of LV pressure isovolumic decay (tau) was prolonged in placebo MI rats, significantly shortened by eplerenone, and normalized by eplerenone/trandolapril. Increased collagen type I gene expression and collagen content in the noninfarcted LV myocardium from MI placebo rats was attenuated by trandolapril, but almost completely prevented by eplerenone and eplerenone/trandolapril. The addition of eplerenone to ACE inhibition prevented sarcoplasmic-reticulum calcium ATPase downregulation and the increases in LV gene expression of beta-MHC and atrial natriuretic factor more effectively than either monotherapy. Furthermore, combination treatment attenuated the increase in myocardial angiotensin II type 1 receptor expression and increased phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein levels.",

In the CHARM study, candesartan reduced cardiovascular deaths and hospital admissions for heart failure, both in patients who were already taking an ACE-inhibitor and in those who were ACE intolerant. However, results in patients with preserved left ventricular function were less conclusive. The BASEL study supports the use of B-type natriuretic peptide testing to confirm the diagnosis of heart failure in patients presenting with acute dyspnoea. In EUROPA, the largest ever study of secondary prevention of coronary artery disease, long-term treatment with perindopril reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac arrest.

    "548": "New methods of manufacture have enabled the creation of novel dosage forms with unique rapid-dispersion properties. This study combines one such technique with a statistical experimental design to develop dosage forms from captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used to treat cases of hypertensive emergency. The TheriForm process, a novel microfabrication technique, was used to build the dosage forms in a layer-by-layer fashion. Three key formulation factors were chosen for the design of experiments. A modified central composite design (Box-Behnken design) was used to maximize the efficiency of the experiments. A total of 13 distinct formulations were fabricated and tested, using mannitol as the bulk excipient. In addition, three replicates of the center point were tested to assess variability and experimental error. These formulations were tested for speed of dispersion (flash time), active content, hardness, friability, and moisture absorption. Regression analysis was performed to fit data responses to quadratic equations. Excellent dose accuracy (95% to 102% of target) and content uniformity (between 1.03% to 2.84%) were observed from all experimental formulation batches. As expected, the choice of powder additive (maltitol, maltodextrin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone), level of additive (2.5% to 7.5%), and saturation level of the binder liquid (45% to 65%) were all found to be significant factors for the TheriForm process. The regression analysis suggested that a rapidly dispersing dosage form of optimal physical properties would be obtained when a powder mixture of mannitol (97.5%) and maltitol (2.5%) is used at a saturation level of 45%. In conclusion, rapidly dispersing captopril oral dosage forms were successfully fabricated and tested. A wide range of physical properties, flash time, and hardness, were determined experimentally, and the effects of key formulation factors were identified.",

The risk of acute upper airway obstruction makes angioneurotic edema a concern for emergency room physicians, internists and otolaryngologists because prompt recognition of the condition and immediate institution of therapy is essential for proper airway management. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have recently been associated with angioneurotic edema, the probable link being the reduction in angiotensin II and the potentiation of bradykinin, resulting in vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability and angioedema. We report four cases of acquired angioneurotic edema, which were probably related to ACE inhibitor use. These cases are discussed, including a review of the literature, methods of diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of angioedema. Care should be taken when antihypertensive ACE inhibitor treatments are started and patients should be warned of the potential risk of angioneurotic edema.",

Severe hypotension with oliguria developed during surgery and persisted during postoperative recovery, with anuria, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia and hyperpotassemia. Although the symptoms were initially attributed to prior treatment with ACE inhibitors and diuretics together with combined anesthesia, the patient's lack of response to crystalloid, colloid and inotropic catecholamine therapy in the context of anuria, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia and hyperpotassemia led us to consider a diagnosis of Addisonian crisis. Blood samples were taken to determine adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, and hydrocortisone treatment was started. The patient responded to treatment and cortisol levels fell, confirming the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Compensatory endrocrine secretion of cortisol by the contralateral adrenal gland has been observed in patients undergoing nephrectomy and adrenalectomy for excision of a hypernephroma, and replacement therapy is therefore not recommended. Perioperative Addisonian crises have also been described in patients suffering great surgical stress, and severe hypotension has been observed in patients on long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors after induction of general anesthesia and after epidural anesthesia with local anesthetics. The combination of these factors made rapid diagnosis and start of appropriate therapy difficult.", 
    "551": "ACE inhibitors and ARA are for the nephrologist two completely unique classes of antihypertensive agents as they offer the opportunity to control microalbuminuria, proteinuria and slow the progression of renal diseases. These properties have mainly been studied in type 1 and type 2 diabetics but can be extended to a wide range of renal diseases. The renal effects of the two classes of compounds differ but the clinical significance of these differences remains to be ascertained.", 
    "552": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. The favorable effects of inhibitors of this system are mainly due to a decrease of the production of angiotensin II. Usual association between angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIA) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors results of a mutual action on the RAS, but important differences exist. ACE inhibitors demonstrated major benefits in heart failure and in post-infarction. In diabetic patients, ACE inhibitor treatment is associated with nephroprotective effects. In four main studies ACE inhibitors didn't demonstrated superior effect on primary outcome compare to standard antihypertensive treatment (diuretics or beta-blockers). However, in HOPE and PROGRESS studies, ACE inhibitors decrease myocardial infarction incidence, even after arterial pressure adjustment. Can we expect the same effects with the AIIA? Of course a direct comparison would be preferable, but some differences emerge. In a main study, AIIA treatment was compared to a standard antihypertensive treatment. The LIFE trial demonstrated superior benefits with losartan than with beta-blocker atenolol for the same degree of blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Losartan had particularly strong effect on risk for stroke and prevented new-onset diabetes. So we have some data to emit the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors decrease the incidence of myocardial infarction and AIIA the incidence of stroke.", 
    "553": "The recent years have witnessed tremendous advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure (CHF), leading to significant improvement in therapy. Recognition of the deleterious effects of angiotensin II is an major therapeutic target. By blocking the transformation of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) improve symptoms, exercise tolerance and survival at all stages of CHF. Angiotensin II-receptors blockers (ARB) have several theoretical advantages over ACEI, including a better tolerance profile, that may lead to a more favourable effect. In CHF with systolic dysfunction, randomised-controlled trials comparing losartan to captopril (ELITE 1 and ELITE 2) or valsartan versus placebo on top of conventional therapy (Val-HeFT) failed to demonstrate a superiority of ARB's compared to ACEI in terms of mortality. However, ARB's appeared better tolerated in this indication. The treatment of CHF with preserved systolic function remains unclear and may be defined in a near future by two studies addressing the role of on candesartan (CHARM study) or irbesartan (I-Preserve study) in this form of CHF. ACEI and beta-blockers remain on first line for treating CHF due to systolic dysfunction. Losartan or valsartan can be considered as an alternative if ACEI are not tolerated or contraindicated.", 
    "554": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in haemodynamic maladaptations of diabetic kidney. Its effects may be modulated by endogenous substances like noradrenaline. Our aim was to study renal vascular response to angiotensin II and the interaction between intrarenal RAS and noradrenergic system at an early diabetic stage. Seven days after alloxan induction of diabetes, concentration-response curves to noradrenaline and angiotensin were generated in isolated, perfused rat kidneys. Percent changes in renal vascular resistance were considered as contractile responses. Diabetic kidneys showed enhanced noradrenaline sensitivity compared to controls. Enalapril and losartan elicited increments in ED(50) of noradrenaline in diabetics (diabetic, 3.4+/-0.2 nmol; diabetic + enalapril, 5.1+/-0.5 nmol, p<0.01 vs. diabetic; diabetic + losartan, 5.5+/-0.7 nmol, p<0.05 vs. diabetic). Maximum response (MR) and sensitivity to angiotensin were augmented in diabetics compared to controls. Prazosin decreased MR and sensitivity in diabetics (MR: control, 156.4%+/-5.1%; diabetic, 262.2%+/-21.1%, p<0.001 vs. control; diabetic + prazosin, 178.8%+/-11.2%, p<0.01 vs. diabetic). Enalapril, losartan and prazosin did not change control responses. At this diabetic stage, renal vasculature presented increased response to angiotensin, and an interaction between renal RAS and noradrenergic system was evidenced. Vascular response to noradrenaline requires the integrity of intrarenal RAS and the participation of AT(1) receptors; alpha(1)-adrenoceptors contribute to vascular response to angiotensin.",

The exercise group had significantly higher adjusted means on the role physical, role emotional, and mental functioning subscales of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey compared with the control group.

The relationship between ACE inhibitor status and log-normalized CRP levels remained significant (P<0.0001) after we controlled for important confounding variables and concomitant treatments.

We investigated the time-dependent leukocyte influx and appearance of apoptosis, as well as the contribution of angiotensin (ANG) II receptor action on these processes in the meconium-induced lung injury. Experimental meconium aspiration was induced by intratracheal instillation of human meconium in 18 rats, and eight rats were further pretreated with an unspecific ANG II receptor inhibitor saralasin. Rats were ventilated with 60% oxygen for 1, 3, or 5 h, and the lungs were then studied histologically for tissue injury and with DNA nick-end labeling and electron microscopy for apoptotic cell death. Lung tissue myeloperoxidase activity and expression of angiotensinogen mRNA and endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide (EMAP) II protein were also analyzed. The meconium-instilled lungs showed increasing neutrophil migration and histologic injury after the first hour, whereas the number of epithelial apoptotic cells was elevated from the control level throughout the study. Myeloperoxidase activity was high, and the angiotensinogen mRNA and EMAP II protein was up-regulated at 5 h after the meconium insult. Pretreatment with saralasin significantly prevented the increase in lung tissue myeloperoxidase activity, EMAP II, and lung epithelial apoptosis. The results suggest that pulmonary meconium insult rapidly results in epithelial apoptosis, before significant neutrophil sequestration into the lungs. Apoptotic cell death is further connected with ANG II receptor action in the meconium-contaminated lung tissue.",

For both ACS and PCI, the magnitude of vascular inflammation is linked to adverse late clinical outcomes (e.g., death, recurrent myocardial infarction [MI] or ischemia, and restenosis). Many pharmacologic therapies with demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of ACS have anti-inflammatory properties, which are distinct from their perceived primary mechanism of action. The anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin, clopidogrel, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, statins, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed, and the hypothesis is generated that modulation of vascular inflammation at least in part contributes a common basis for the long-term clinical benefit ascribed to these medications.

These estimates, from cohort studies, have been corroborated by the results of randomised trials in persons with high, average and below average levels of blood pressure. In spite of its importance in causing cardiovascular disease blood pressure is a poor predictor of cardiovascular events. Its poor screening performance is illustrated by the findings that in the largest cohort study, persons in the top 10% of the distribution of systolic blood pressure experienced only 21% of all ischaemic heart disease events and 28% of all strokes at a given age. Combining several reversible risk factors adds little to the screening performance of blood pressure alone; for example the 25% of men aged 5564 at highest computed risk (> or =1%) experience only 46% of all ischaemic heart disease events. The main methods of screening should be to identify all persons with a history of cardiovascular disease events (for example identifying patients at the time of hospital discharge following a first myocardial infarction detects 50% of all heart disease deaths in a population at a false positive rate of 12%), and to use a person's age. Identifying everyone with a history of myocardial infarction or stroke in a population and everyone aged 55 or more would include 98% of all deaths from ischaemic heart disease and stroke. The five main categories of blood pressure lowering drugs, thiazides, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers, significantly reduce blood pressure from all pre-treatment levels though the extent of the blood pressure reduction increased with pre-treatment blood pressure. The reductions were similar at standard dose for the five categories; average reduction was 9.1 systolic and 5 diastolic. The effect of combinations of two drugs on blood pressure was additive. No effect of age was apparent, given blood pressure. There were no serious metabolic consequences of using these drugs in standard dose.",

The report suggests that the term hypertension should be avoided because it is not a disease and it implies another category (normotensives) who would not benefit from lowering blood pressure. Blood pressure reduction using combinations of safe, well-established drugs is effective in preventing cardiovascular events. It is therefore suggested that such preventive therapy be considered more widely in people who by virtue of existing disease or simply age are at risk of a heart attack or stroke regardless of initial blood pressure.",

After administration of captopril, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures decreased significantly from control levels and HR increased; however, the effects were greater in 1- than in 6-week-old lambs. In 1-week-old lambs, after administration of captopril, there was also a significant increase in the slope coefficient, a decrease in minimum HR and a decrease in the point of maximum gain. In 6-week-old lambs, there were no effects of captopril on any of the parameters governing the arterial baroreflex. Therefore, we accept our hypothesis and conclude that the role of ANG II in modulating cardiovascular homeostasis appears to be more predominant in the newborn than later in life.",

The same patients were examined for antibodies to peptide angiotensin II (AT-II). Enzyme immunoassay has shown that a significantly elevated level of antibodies to AT-II was only in 5 examinees. The same patients had also high Nab to ACE. The study of a group of ischemic heart disease patients with adverse effects attributed to bronchial affection treated with enalapril and diroton (ACE inhibitors) demonstrates that deterioration of cough and external respiration function is not related to exacerbation of existing chronic pulmonary inflammation. None of the patients had elevated body temperature or inflammatory changes in the blood, other signs of inflammation. Enzyme immunoassay also proved that the initial level of Nab equaled mean value for donors or was insignificantly lower. Blood serum patients with side effects contained a significantly (p < 0.02) elevated quantities of Nab to bradikinin vs initial values. Thus, the proposed method of solid phase enzyme immunoassay quantifies Nab to ACE and its substrates in the patients.", 
    "589": "The public health burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been dramatically increased worldwide. Not only its prevalence rate at present but the increase of its incidence in the near future can create a global health problem. The rapid increase of the total number of newly diagnosed diabetic patients proved to be associated with the increasing prevalence rate of obesity. The metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes can contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis and, therefore, the target organ damages can carry a serious problem for the individuals and also for the whole society. It is obvious, that the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus is of great importance. There is now substantial evidence that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed by lifestyle interventions, i.e. diet and exercise should be the first choice in order to avoid weight gain when preventing diabetes. Pharmacological intervention should not be routinely used to prevent diabetes although results of large clinical trials with metformin and acarbose in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance are available. It is noteworthy that a decrease in the number of newly diagnosed diabetes was observed in prospective, double blind clinical studies evaluating the effect of new antihypertensive drugs (captopril, ramipril, lisinopril, nifedipine GITS, amlodipine, losartan) or lipid-lowering agents (pravastatin) on the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high risk patients. In these studies the relative risk reduction of newly diagnosed diabetes was evaluated in comparison to placebo or other drugs in a subgroup of non-diabetic patients at baseline. In addition, the incidence of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes decreased parallel with weight loss in clinical trials with orlistat, an anti-obesity drug. Although new results were provided by evidence based clinical trials a lot of questions remained to be solved. Further research is necessary to understand better how to facilitate effective primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. Further data are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of currently used antidiabetic drugs and, in addition, the possible role of other drugs (antihypertensives, lipid lowering agents, anti-obesity drugs) should also be investigated in order to identify the optimal primary prevention policy of type 2 diabetes.", 
    "590": "Neuropeptide processing metalloenzymes, such as angiotensin converting enzyme, neprilysin, endothelin converting enzyme, neurolysin, and EC3.4.24.15 (EP24.15), are central to the formation and degradation of bioactive peptides. We present EP24.15 as a paradigm for novel functions ascribed to these enzymes in the neurome. Although the neurome typically encompasses proteomes of the brain and central nervous system, exciting new roles of these neuropeptidases have been demonstrated in other organ systems. We discuss the involvement of EP24.15 with clinical sequelae involving the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; LHRH) analogs that act as enzyme inhibitors, in vascular physiology (blood pressure regulation), and in the hematologic system (immune surveillance). Hemodynamic forces, such as cyclic strain and shear stress, on vascular cells, induce an increase in EP24.15 transcription, suggesting that neuropeptidase-mediated hydrolysis of pressor/depressor peptides is likely regulated by changes in hemodynamic force and blood pressure. Lastly, EP24.15 regulates surface expression of major histocompatibility complex Class I proteins in vivo, suggesting that EP24.15 may play an important role in maintenance of immune privilege in sites of increased endogenous expression. In these extraneural systems, regulation of both neuropeptide and other peptide substrates by neuropeptidases indicates that the influence of these enzymes may be more global than was anticipated previously, and suggests that their attributed role as neuropeptidases underestimates their physiologic actions in the neural system.", 
    "591": "In chronic heart failure (CHF), the derangement of autonomic nervous system activity has a deep impact on the progression of the disease. It has been demonstrated that modulation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) increases autonomic control of heart rate and reduces adrenergic activity. We sought to evaluate, in CHF, the different effects of an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and of an AT1 receptor antagonist (valsartan) on heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity and norepinephrine plasma levels.", 
    "592": "Ninety patients (61 +/- 10 years, 2.3 +/- 0.5, New York Heart Association class) with CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction <40% were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive lisinopril (uptitrated to 20 mg/d) or valsartan (uptitrated to 160 mg/d) therapy for 16 weeks. Heart rate variability (evaluated by measuring standard deviation of normal R-R intervals on 24-hour ECG recordings), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity and aldosterone and norepinephrine plasma levels were assessed before and after drug therapy.", 
    "593": "There were no significant differences between valsartan and lisinopril in their effects on left ventricular function, arterial pressure, aldosterone plasma levels and autonomic control of heart rate. Both lisinopril and valsartan significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine levels, but the reduction induced by valsartan was significantly greater than that observed for lisinopril (27% vs 6%, P <.05).", 
    "594": "This study shows a comparable effect of ACE inhibition (lisinopril) and of AT1 receptor antagonism (valsartan) on cardiac vagal control of heart rate, whereas valsartan has shown a more effective modulation of sympathetic activity measured by plasma norepinephrine levels.", 
    "595": "Angiotensin II (ANG II), a key regulator of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis, exerts mitogenic effects on endothelial cells. We therefore hypothesized that ANG II could be a mediator between homeostatic changes within the vascular perfusion bed and growth factor-driven angiogenesis. In the present study, we applied the alginate implant angiogenesis model in mice with normal ANG II levels, elevated ANG II levels by transgenic overexpression of angiotensinogen (AOGEN), or in AT2 receptor-deficient mice. We demonstrate that a decrease in the amount of circulating ANG II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril or the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan induced a stimulation of in vivo angiogenesis implying an inhibitory function of ANG II through the AT1 receptor. However, the strong increase of angiogenesis in AOGEN-transgenic mice compared with mice with normal ANG II levels suggests additional stimulatory activity. We showed that the ANG II-induced stimulation of angiogenesis is linked to the AT2 receptor as an impaired induction of angiogenesis was obtained in AT2 receptor knockout mice. These findings provide the first evidence that the AT2 receptor mediates a stimulation of in vivo angiogenesis and indicate that ANG II is a humoral regulator of peripheral angiogenesis involving two receptor subtypes with opposing actions.", 
    "596": "Inhibition of the first and rate-limiting step of the renin-angiotensin system has long been an elusive therapeutic goal. Aliskiren, the first known representative of a new class of completely nonpeptide, orally active, renin inhibitors, has been shown to inhibit the production of angiotensin I and II in healthy volunteers and to reduce blood pressure (BP) in sodium-depleted marmosets. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, active comparator trial study was to assess the BP-lowering efficacy and safety of aliskiren. Two hundred twenty-six patients, 21 to 70 years of age, with mild to moderate hypertension, were randomly assigned to receive 37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg aliskiren or 100 mg losartan daily for 4 weeks. Dose-dependent reductions in daytime ambulatory systolic pressure (mean change, mm Hg [SD of change]; -0.4 [11.7], -5.3 [11.3], -8.0 [11.0], and -11.0 [11.0], P=0.0002) and in plasma renin activity (median change % [interquartile range]; -55 [-64, -11], -60 [-82, -46], -77 [-86, -72], and -83 [-92, -71], P=0.0008) were observed with 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 mg aliskiren. The change in daytime systolic pressure with 100 mg losartan (-10.9 [13.8]) was not significantly different from the changes seen with 75, 150, and 300 mg aliskiren. Aliskiren was well tolerated at all doses studied. This study demonstrates that aliskiren, through inhibition of renin, is an effective and safe orally active BP-lowering agent. Whether renin inhibition results in protection from heart attack, stroke, and nephropathy, similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade, needs to be researched.", 
    "597": "Bradykinin is a potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator in the coronary vascular bed. Endothelial mediators released by bradykinin include nitric oxide, prostacyclin and as yet unidentified endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factors. We wished to determine the involvement of nitric oxide and prostaglandin pathways in the cardioprotective actions mediated by bradykinin via the combined inhibition of ACE and aminopeptidase P (APP) in an in vivo rat model of acute ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (4h). Myocardial infarct size was measured by using the staining agent 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC). Lipid peroxide levels in serum and in heart tissue were estimated spectrophotometrically. A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored at various intervals throughout the experiment. Infarct size reduction obtained with the combined inhibition of enalapril and apstatin, lisinopril and apstatin was blocked partially but significantly with the prior administration of L-NAME (Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) or aspirin, suggesting the involvement of both nitric oxide and prostaglandin pathways in the cardioprotective actions mediated by bradykinin.", 
    "598": "Neurohormonal activation has been shown to be a major factor in congestive heart failure progression and mortality. The beneficial effects obtained in clinical trials with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists have confirmed this hypothesis. 5,6-Diisobutirroyloxy-2-methyl-aminotetraline hydrochloride (nolomirole) is a selective agonist of prejunctional D(2)-dopaminergic and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. The stimulation of these receptors inhibits catecholamine release from sympathetic nerve endings. To confirm that this mechanism can be useful in congestive heart failure, we studied the effects of nolomirole on monocrotaline-induced congestive heart failure. The ACE inhibitor trandolapril was used as reference compound. Rats were given single intraperitoneal injection of either saline (control group; n=20) or monocrotaline (50 mg kg(-1)). Three days later, the monocrotaline-treated animals were randomly allocated (n=50 per group) to oral treatment with distilled water (vehicle group), nolomirole (0.25 mg kg(-1)) twice a day, or trandolapril (0.3 mg kg(-1)) once a day up to sacrifice. On the fourth week after monocrotaline injection, animals with signs of congestive heart failure were sacrificed for evaluation of heart hypertrophy and neuroendocrine alterations. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and alderosterone were determined by radioimmunoassay in plasma. Tissue norepinephrine concentration was quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Nolomirole and trandolapril significantly reduced (a) hypertrophy of right atria and ventricles, (b) plasma levels of ANP and presence of pleural/peritoneal effusions and (c) norepinephrine depletion of right ventricle. These findings confirmed that nolomirole, like trandolapril, is able to attenuate the heart failure signs in the monocrotaline-induced congestive heart failure model.", 
    "599": "Translocation and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to occur in the ischemic heart. It is, however, controversial if this activation process occurs also in the non-ischemic, remote area of an infarcted heart early after infarction. Furthermore, the mechanisms contributing to the translocation process induced by acute myocardial ischemia in both areas are not fully elucidated.", 
    "600": "Regional myocardial infarction was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD-) ligation in situ for 2.5 min in rats or in pigs. To evaluate the influence of angiotensin and bradykinin signaling, ramiprilat, candesartan, or the bradykinin-receptor antagonist HOE 140 was given. In biopsies from the ischemic and the non-ischemic remote area, PKC activity and intracellular isozyme distribution were determined.", 
    "601": "Translocation and activation of PKC could be demonstrated for the first time in the myocardium remote from the infarcted area. This activation was conserved both in pigs and in rats. All major cardiac isozymes of PKC were involved. Whereas bradykinin-receptor blockade had no effect, both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor could effectively block this activation process of PKC.", 
    "602": "In the area remote from a myocardial infarction, the activation of PKC could be detected for the first time as early as 2.5 min after LAD ligation. This newly characterized activation in the non-infarcted area can be prevented by ACEI via an angiotensin-AT1-receptor-dependent mechanism. It is supposed that this newly characterized activation process of PKC plays an important role in the signal transduction in the remote myocardium in acute myocardial infarction as a trigger for the late development of hypertrophy and heart failure.", 
    "603": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared to normotensive rats display an accelerated decline in spatial learning and memory. However, few studies have systematically examined the independent contribution of hypertension vs. other age-related mechanisms to this decline. The present study uses a repeated acquisition water maze task to test the hypothesis that hypertension and/or the presence of angiotensin II can accelerate the age-related decrease of spatial learning and memory in rats. We have previously shown that both SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) display age-related decreases in spatial learning and memory; however, the rate of decline differs between the strains. The present results demonstrate that compared to young rats of the same strain, learning and memory in SHR declines significantly already at 12 months of age, and at 24 months of age both SHR and WKY rats are severely impaired in the water maze task. Lifetime treatment of either SHR or WKY with the antihypertensive drug captopril [an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor] significantly attenuates the age-related impairment in learning and memory. In contrast, chronic treatment of SHR with captopril from 6 months of age only modestly decreases the decline in learning and memory. Whereas lifetime treatment with the vasodilator drug hydralazine also reduces arterial pressure in SHR, this treatment does not significantly preserve learning in 24-month-old SHR. Together, the data suggest captopril can delay the decline in spatial learning and memory in both aging SHR and WKY. Further, the results indicate that the memory enhancing effects of captopril are not primarily the due to the ability of captopril to lower blood pressure.", 
    "604": "We have evaluated the effects of an ACE inhibitor, enalapril (ENA) and of an angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan (LOS), administered either at hypotensive or non-hypotensive dosage, on the cardiac and renal structure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Forty-eight rats were included in the study: eight SHR were treated with low-dose (ld, 1 mg/kg/day) ENA; eight with low-dose (ld, 0.5 mg/kg/day) LOS; eight with high-dose (hd, 25 mg/kg/day) ENA; eight with high-dose (hd, 15 mg/kg/day) LOS; while eight Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and eight SHR were kept untreated (unt). Treatment was given from the 4th to the 12th week of age. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured non-invasively every week. The left ventricular weight to body weight (RLVM) and the left + right kidney weight (RKW) to body weight was measured, and the cardiac and glomerular interstitial collagen content was evaluated using sirius red staining and image analysis. In addition, cardiac metalloproteinases activity (43 kDa MMP, MMP-2, and MMP-9) was evaluated by zymography. A significant reduction in RLVM was observed in SHR given ENA hd or LOS hd. Cardiac collagen was significantly reduced in SHR ENA hd and SHR LOS hd as well as in SHR LOS ld, but not in SHR ENA ld. The 43 kDa MMP collagenase activity was greater in WKY unt compared with SHR unt, being normalized only in SHR ENA hd. The gelatinase activity of MMP-9 showed a trend similar to 43 kDa MMP, but differences between SHR and WKY unt were only of borderline statistical significance. No difference among groups was observed in MMP-2 activity. No significant differences in RKW was observed between groups. However, the collagen content in the glomerular perivascular space was significantly reduced in all treated groups, including those given ld, compared with SHR unt. In conclusion, LOS and ENA showed a similar preventive effect on the increase of RLVM in SHR, but, at least in part, different effects on the extracellular matrix in different organs, being cardiac collagen less sensitive to low dose (ld) ACE inhibition.", 
    "605": "Having written a prescription for the patient, it is important to monitor for the effects of the drug.", 
    "606": "This article discusses the importance of patient monitoring as part of the prescribing process, and in particular, what factors to monitor.", 
    "607": "Monitoring of drug therapy is an important part of the prescribing process in enhancing the drug's effectiveness. This is partly due to the large variability in patient response to any given dose of a drug. The drug's effect as well as adverse effects should be actively sought, and dosage alterations made in order to enhance the drug's effect. In some cases, this involves directly monitoring for the drug's effects, and in other cases using surrogate markers.", 
    "608": "Improved practice in the management of hypertension depends on an understanding of existing patterns of treatment. To describe the management of newly diagnosed hypertension in British general practice and the effectiveness of current prescribing patterns we conducted a retrospective observational study using data from a computerized general practitioner record database (DIN-LINK). 21 024 patients were first treated for newly diagnosed hypertension between January 1993 and December 1997, and were followed for 4 years. Diuretics or beta-blockers were the most widely prescribed first-line treatments, used in 54% of patients. The mean continuation rate for first-line therapy was 69% at 12 months: the continuation rate was highest for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists. After 12 months of treatment the mean blood pressure reduction was 19/10 mmHg. Blood pressure targets were met in only 14% of patients. After 48 months of treatment 34% of patients had not improved in band of blood pressure severity. Many patients with severe hypertension at 12 months were still being prescribed only one drug. The lack of aggression in antihypertensive treatment, indicated by the low number of agents prescribed and the failure to achieve targets, is disappointing. Prescribing patterns for first-line therapy corresponded to guidelines. Continuation rates on first-line therapy were higher than often reported. The choice of drug for additions to or switches from first-line therapy had no clear pattern. Routinely collected computerized data could be used to support clinical governance activities in primary care.", 
    "609": "Cardiac dysfunction in animals with congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI) is known to be associated with a wide variety of defects in receptor and post-receptor mechanisms. Since the heart function have been shown to be improved by treatment with different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, we examined the effects of imidapril, an ACE inhibitor, on changes in post-receptor mechanisms involving adenylyl cyclase (AC) and G proteins in the failing heart. Heart failure in rats was induced by occluding the coronary artery and 3 weeks later the animals were treated daily with 1 mg/kg (orally) imidapril for 5 weeks. The animals were assessed for their left ventricular function and crude membranes were isolated from the viable left ventricle and examined for AC activities as well as G-protein activities and expression. Animals with heart failure exhibited depressions in ventricular function and AC activities in the absence or presence of forskolin, NaF and Gpp(NH)p. The AC activity in the presence of pertussis toxin was increased whereas that in the presence of cholera toxin was decreased in the failing heart. Protein contents and mRNA levels for G(i)-proteins were increased whereas those for G(s)-proteins were unaltered in the infarcted heart. All these changes due to MI were prevented by imidapril treatment. The results indicate that the depressed cardiac function in the failing heart may partly be due to the direct effects of changes in AC and G(i) proteins.", 
    "610": "Meprin is a zinc endopeptidase of the astacin family, which is expressed as a membrane-bound or secreted protein in mammalian epithelial cells, in intestinal leucocytes and in certain cancer cells. There are two types of meprin subunits, alpha and beta, which form disulphide-bonded homo- and hetero-oligomers. Here we report on the cleavage of matrix proteins by hmeprin (human meprin) alpha and beta homo-oligomers, and on the interactions of these enzymes with inhibitors. Despite their completely different cleavage specificities, both hmeprin alpha and beta are able to hydrolyse basement membrane components such as collagen IV, nidogen-1 and fibronectin. However, they are inactive against intact collagen I. Hence the matrix-cleaving activity of hmeprin resembles that of gelatinases rather than collagenases. Hmeprin is inhibited by hydroxamic acid derivatives such as batimastat, galardin and Pro-Leu-Gly-hydroxamate, by TAPI-0 (tumour necrosis factor alpha protease inhibitor-0) and TAPI-2, and by thiol-based compounds such as captopril. Therapeutic targets for these inhibitors are MMPs (matrix metalloproteases), TACE (tumour necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme) and angiotensin-converting enzyme respectively. The most effective inhibitor of hmeprin alpha in the present study was the naturally occurring hydroxamate actinonin ( K(i)=20 nM). The marked variance in the cleavage specificities of hmeprin alpha and beta is reflected by their interaction with the TACE inhibitor Ro 32-7315, whose affinity for the beta subunit (IC50=1.6 mM) is weaker by three orders of magnitude than that for the alpha subunit ( K(i)=1.6 microM). MMP inhibitors such as the pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione derivative Ro 28-2653 that are more specific for gelatinases do not bind to hmeprin, presumably due to the subtle differences in the mode of zinc binding and active-site structure between the astacins and the MMPs.",

    "612": "Patients (n=54) with NYHA class III-IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35% were randomized either to treatment with bisoprolol (1.25-10 mg/day) (n=30) or in control group (n=24) and were followed up for 12 months.", 
    "613": "The use of bisoprolol was associated with significant improvement of heart failure functional class, lowering of heart rate (by 14%, p<0.01), elevation of systolic blood pressure (by 7.2+/-12.3 mm Hg, p<0.01) and increase of walking distance (by 30.1+/-29.0 m, p<0.01). No significant changes of these parameters occurred in control group. After 12 months increases of left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic volumes (by 85+/-69.2 and 71+/-51.5 ml, respectively, p<0.001) and of ejection fraction (by 5.7+/-7.3%, p<0.01) took place in bisoprolol treated patients. These changes were significantly (p<0.001) higher than those in control group. After 6 months of treatment with bisoprolol noradrenaline concentration fell from 533 to 402 pg/ml (p<0.05) while in controls it rose from 369 to 474 pg/ml, p<0.01). Decreases of plasma renin activity (from 1.2 to 0.42 ng/ml/h), plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (from 17.1 to 13.1 pg/ml) and aldosterone (from 173 to 148 pg/ml, p<0.05) were also observed in bisoprolol group. No substantial dynamics of activity of main components of renin angiotensin system took place in controls. There were no significant changes of atrial natriuretic peptide in both groups. Significant positive dynamics of parameters of heart rate variability was registered only in bisoprolol group: SDNN increased by 25% (p<0.05), high frequency spectrum by 106% (p=0.03), LF/HF ratio from 2.18+/-1.41 to 1.82+/-0.7.", 
    "614": "Long term use of bisoprolol was associated with improved clinical and hemodynamic status, increased systolic BP, blocked processes of pathological left ventricular remodeling, lowered activity of not only sympathetic-adrenal but also of main components of renin-angiotensin system and improved heart rate variability.", 
    "615": "Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has been postulated to have prosclerotic and angiogenic properties. The aim of this present study was to characterize retinal CTGF expression in the absence and presence of diabetes and in the context of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril. Retinas were obtained from control, diabetic, and diabetic plus perindopril-treated (3 mg/d) rats. CTGF gene expression was quantitated by RT-PCR and localized by in situ hybridization. CTGF protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting and localized by immunohistochemistry. Diabetes was associated with a greater than 2-fold increase in CTGF mRNA levels, which was attenuated by perindopril treatment. CTGF immunoreactivity was increased almost 2-fold in diabetes and was ameliorated by the ACE inhibitor perindopril. By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, the major site of CTGF gene expression in the retina of diabetic rats was the ganglion cell layer. Based on the known in vivo effects of CTGF, it is postulated that this growth factor plays a pivotal role in mediating diabetes-associated retinal pathology. Furthermore, the protective effects of ACE inhibitors on retinal pathology may partly be mediated via effects on retinal CTGF expression.", 
    "616": "Amlodipine (a new class of calcium channel antagonist) has been shown to limit the progression of arteriosclerosis and decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of amlodipine, however, remain unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that amlodipine attenuates the development of arteriosclerosis through the inhibition of inflammation in vivo. Long-term inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) by administration of a NO synthase inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), to rats induces coronary vascular inflammation [monocyte infiltration, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression, increased activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)], and arteriosclerosis. Here, we used the rat model to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of amlodipine in vivo. Treatment with amlodipine markedly inhibited the L-NAME-induced increase in vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, and local ACE and Rho activity and prevented arteriosclerosis. Interestingly, amlodipine prevented the L-NAME-induced increase in MCP-1 receptor CCR2 expression in circulating monocytes. Amlodipine markedly attenuated the high mortality rate at 8 wk of treatment. These data suggest that amlodipine attenuated arteriosclerosis through inhibiting inflammatory disorders in the rat model of long-term inhibition of NO synthesis. The anti-inflammatory effects of amlodipine seem to be mediated not only by the inhibition of local factors such as MCP-1 but also by the decrease in CCR2 in circulating monocytes. Inhibition of the MCP-1 to CCR2 pathway may represent novel anti-inflammatory actions of amlodipine beyond blood pressure lowering.", 
    "617": "Our in vivo assay for thrombolysis consisted of recording the weight of platelet-rich thrombi adhering to a collagen strip that was superfused with arterial blood in extracorporal circulation of anaesthetised Wistar rats. Immediate thrombolysis occurred in response to intravenously administrated angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) at non-hypotensive doses of 3-30 microg kg(-1) (captopril<perindopril<quinapril). The thrombolytic response lasted up to 3 h with maximum reduction of the weight of thrombus by 75%. Pretreatment with COX-1 and COX-3 inhibitors (aspirin at a low dose of 1 mg kg(-1), SC 560 and acetaminophen, 0.3-3 mg kg(-1)) slightly augmented thrombolysis by ACE-I, while COX-2 inhibitors (nimesulide and coxibs at doses <1 mg kg(-1) and aspirin at a high dose of 50 mg kg(-1)) or a kinin B2 receptor antagonist (icatibant) abolished it. NOS inhibition by L-NAME blunted and delayed thrombolysis by ACE-I. In parallel to maximum thrombolysis by quinapril (30 microg kg(-1)), plasma levels of 6-keto-PGF1alpha rose significantly from 40 +/- 7 to 554 +/- 91 pg ml(-1) (n=5, mean +/- S.D.), while basal levels of PGE2 (12 +/- 3 pg ml(-1)) and TXB2 (47 +/- 11 pg ml(-1)) remained essentially unchanged. Pretreatment with celecoxib (0.1-1.0 mg kg(-1)) abolished not only thrombolysis by quinapril but also the quinapril-induced rise in plasma 6-keto-PGF1alpha. In cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, perindoprilate (30 microM) increased cytosolic free calcium [Ca2+]i, but this effect was by three to four orders of magnitude weaker than that of bradykinin (Bk). In aortas of Wistar rats, the transcripts of COX-2 and PGI-S were overexpressed as compared to COX-1. Thus, in blood vessels of Wistar rats, the preferable route of the PGI2 generation might lead through the COX-2 pathway. We conclude that in Wistar rats, ACE-I induces thrombolysis via accumulation of endogenous kinins over the endothelium and a subsequent activation of B2 receptors followed by the release of prostacyclin and nitric oxide. Thrombolysis by ACE-I seems to be mediated mainly through prostacyclin that is made by COX-2. It may well be that an increase in endothelial [Ca2+]i by ACE-I activates phospholipase A2, which supplies COX-2 with the substrate for making thrombolytic prostacyclin.", 
    "618": "An inhibitor of the metallo-ectoenzyme, pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase II (PPII), a thyrotropin releasing hormone-specific peptidase, was identified by screening extracts from marine species of the Cuban coast-line belonging to the phylla Chordata, Echinodermata, Annelida, Mollusca, Cnidaria, Porifera, Chlorophyta and Magnoliophyta. Isolation of the inhibitor (HcPI), from the marine annelide Hermodice carunculata, was achieved by trichloroacetic acid treatment of the aqueous extract, followed by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE Sephacel, gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and reverse phase-HPLC. HcPI had a small apparent molecular weight (below 1000 Da) and was not a peptide. It inhibited rat PPII (a membrane preparation with 8.5mg protein/ml) with an apparent K(i) of 51 nM. HcPI did not inhibit serine (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV), cysteine (papain, bromelain and pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase I), aspartic (pepsin and recombinant human immunodeficiency virus 1 protease (HIV1-PR)) nor other metallo proteinases (collagenase, gelatinase, angiotensin converting enzyme, aminopeptidase N and carboxypeptidase A). HcPI was non-toxic and active in vivo. Intraperitoneal injection of HcPI reduced mouse pituitary and brain PPII activity. Potency of the effect was higher in hypophysis and hypothalamus than in other brain regions. Intrathecal administration to male rats reduced PPII activity in the spinal cord. In conclusion we have identified a specific inhibitor of PPII that is the first M1 family zinc metallo-peptidase inhibitor isolated from marine invertebrates. It may be useful for elucidating the in vivo role of PPII in the pituitary and central nervous system.", 
    "619": "Heart and liver mitochondria isolated from rats treated with enalapril, 3-30 mg/kg/day in the drinking water for 7-120 days, showed a time- and dose-dependent increased nitric oxide (NO) production in the range of 14-250%. Heart and liver mitochondria from control rats produced 0.69 and 0.50 nmol of NO/min/mg of protein, respectively, as determined by dual wavelength spectrophotometry (577-591 nm) following hemoglobin oxidation to methemoglobin. The response to enalapril treatment, attributed to a gene-mediated up-regulation of mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS) activity, was half-maximal at 5-6 days and was maintained up to 120 days. Enalapril-treated animals showed an increased mtNOS functional activity in heart mitochondria that inhibited state 3 O(2) uptake (from 22% in control rats to 43%) and increased state 4 hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production (from 30% in control rats to 52%). Calculated heart intramitochondrial NO and H(2)O(2) steady-state concentrations were increased 66% and 20%, respectively, by enalapril treatment. Signaling pathways dependent on mitochondrial NO and H(2)O(2) may account for the beneficial effects of enalapril in aging mammals.", 
    "620": "For the management of chronic heart failure, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) are useful, however, the differences between the two groups of agents are unclear. We compared the effects of long-term treatment with an ACEI (imidapril) and an ARB (TA-606) in rats that had recovered from experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). Forty-two Lewis rats were immunized with porcine cardiac myosin on day 0 and divided into 6 groups, group C (distilled water), group IL (imidapril 0.5 mg/kg/day), group IH (imidapril 2 mg/kg/day), group TL (TA-606 2 mg/kg/day), group TH (TA-606 6 mg/kg/day), and group IT (imidapril 0.5 mg/kg/day + TA-606 2 mg/kg/day). Drugs were administered from day 28. Hemodynamic parameters, heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW), and area of fibrosis were measured on days 70-74. Only the high dose of imidapril significantly decreased central venous pressure and significantly increased maximum dP/dt and the absolute value of minimum dP/dt. HW/BW was suppressed in groups IH, TH, and IT. Thus, in treatment of chronic heart failure in rats, a sufficient dose of ACEI was needed to improve hemodynamics and to prevent ventricular hypertrophy. The hemodynamic effects of ARB and combination therapy of both drugs at low doses were not significant.", 
    "621": "The short-term (three months) effects of rilmenidine on systemic hypertension induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions in comparison with those of perindopril and nifedipine-slow release (SR) formulation were studied. The short-term effects of rilmenidine on biochemical parameters and lipid profiles were evaluated. Sixty patients (39 men, 21 women) with a mean age of 59 +/- 14 years and with mild to moderate systemic arterial hypertension were enrolled in three groups. The first group received 1 mg/day of rilmenidine, the second group 4 mg/day of perindopril, and the third group 20 mg/day of nifedipine SR. All drugs induced a similar decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) values. Left ventricular mass (LVM) and LVM index decreased equally in all groups associated with a significant increase in the E/A ratio. The ratio between the reduction in LVM and decrease in mean arterial pressure (LVM/mmHg) was higher in groups 1 and 2. Negative correlations between LVM and LVMI. E/A, and the dv/dt ratio were obtained. Rilmenidine did not change the blood chemistry and lipid profile values. Despite its neutral effect on lipid profile and biochemical parameters. rilmenidine is as effective as perindopril and nifedipine in controlling hypertension and decreasing left ventricular hypertrophy.",

On the other hand, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors from several companies have failed in both cancer and rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. Mindful of the MMP inhibitor experience, this chapter explores how tractable proteases are as drug targets from a chemistry perspective. It examines the recent success of other classes of drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and highlights the need to consider where putative targets lie on pathophysiological pathways--regardless of what kind of therapeutic entity would be required to target them. With genome research yielding many possible new drug targets, it explores the likelihood of discovering proteolytic enzymes that are causally responsible for disease processes and that might therefore make better targets, especially if they lead to the development of drugs that can be administered orally. It also considers the impact that biologics are having on drug discovery, and in particular whether biologically derived therapeutics such as antibodies are likely to significantly alter the way we view proteases as targets and the methods used to discover therapeutic inhibitors.",

With technological improvements in the treatment of coronary artery disease, improved survival after myocardial infarction, and better hypertension therapy, patients are living longer, thus the need for successful management of older patients with chronic heart failure. The elderly, especially minorities, tend to be under-represented in congestive heart failure trials. This article will focus on the care of the geriatric patient with congestive heart failure.",

    "626": "Patients aged 18 to 75 with newly diagnosed stage I or II hypertension were eligible. Endothelium-dependent brachial artery FMD and endothelium-independent vasodilation were assessed at baseline. Patients were treated with oral perindopril 2 mg plus indapamide 0.625-mg tablets once daily for 6 months. FMD measurements were then repeated. Percentage changes in FMD from baseline to 6 months, as well as left ventricular diastolic function parameters (isovolumic relaxation time [IVRT] and mitral diastolic E-wave deceleration time [EDT]), indicated the effectiveness of the intervention.", 
    "627": "Twenty-nine Turkish patients were enrolled (17 women, 12 men; mean [SD] age, 54.5 [9.5] years [range, 38-75 years]). The mean (SD) baseline FMD was 7.00% (2.39%) (endothelial cell dysfunction) and increased significantly to 8.68% (2.78%) at 6 months (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02); FMD improved in 15 patients (51.7%). At baseline and 6 months of therapy, mean (SD) IVRT was 101.7 (12.4) ms and 95.5 (7.7) ms, respectively (P<0.001), and EDT was 234.7 (33.9) ms and 217.9 (25.6) ms, respectively (P<0.001).",

    "630": "The natriuretic and diuretic effect induced by carbachol (CBC) were partially inhibited by pretreatment of losartan, a specific blocker of angiotensin AT1 receptor (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that both TH-IR density and number of TH-IR positive neurons were markedly increased in PaPo, Arc, Pe and AHP of hypothalamus at 40 min after carbachol administration, as compared with NS group (P < 0.05). However, in losartan pretreated group, the number and the density of TH-IR were significantly decreased in such nuclei mentioned above except PaPo.", 
    "631": "The results above suggest that brain AT1 receptor appears to be involved in mediating natriuresis induced by cholinergic stimulus. The blockade of AT1 receptor may down regulate the excitability of adrenergic neurons in Arc, Pe and AHP induced by CBC. We postulate that brain adrenergic and angiotensinergic pathway get involved in natriuresis induced by brain cholinergic stimulus together. Moreover, angiotensinergic neurons may influence the activity of adrenergic neurons in hypothalamus.", 
    "632": "In order to slow the progression of chronic renal failure (CRF), a multimodal approach should be applied if the efficacy is proved. Although compelling evidence of a beneficial effect exists for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and low-protein diets, there is little evidence on whether carbon adsorbent has an effect on retardation of the progression of CRF.",

In experiment 2, renal function and proteinuria were significantly ameliorated in the ADK group compared with AD at 48 weeks. Concomitantly with the preservation of renal function, pathological indices, including the glomerular sclerosis index and the interstitial fibrosis index, were significantly improved in ADK compared with AD. In the ADK group, Ht and serum albumin did not change over the 48 weeks.",

Four-year follow-up studies were undertaken to evaluate the impact of these parameters on the development of chronic allograft dysfunction.", 
    "638": "Urinary TGFBeta1 excretion and PRA response to ACE-I in renal transplant patients who developed chronic allograft nephropathy 4 years after the evaluations (n = 7) were significantly higher and greater, respectively, than these values in those who did not ( n = 9; P < 0.01). If the cutoff level for urinary TGFBeta1 excretion was 250 pg/min, the 4-year positive predictive value (PPV) with respect to the development of chronic allograft nephropathy was 83% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 78% (sensitivity [sen.], 71%; specificity [sp.], 88%). If the cutoff level for PRA at 60 min after ACE-I was 4.0 ng/ml per h, the 4-year PPV was 71% and NPV was 75% (sen., 70%; sp., 75%). The stable transplant patients with high TGFBeta1 excretion and exaggerated PRA response showed significantly higher rates of chronic allograft dysfunction than those with low TGFBeta1 excretion and weak PRA response.", 
    "639": "This study demonstrates that some transplant patients with longterm stable graft function show increases in the activities of the TGFBeta system and the RAS. Evaluations of urinary TGFBeta1 excretion and PRA response to ACE-I present a possibility for predicting the development of chronic allograft dysfunction, with significant 4-year predictive values.", 
    "640": "We previously reported that the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan was effective in reducing blood pressure and microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were replaced due to side effects. In the present study, the clinical effects of candesartan were investigated and compared with ACE inhibitors in patients with stage 2 or 3A diabetic nephropathy, mainly with respect to the effects on the urinary excretion of albumin and type IV collagen.", 
    "641": "Forty-nine patients (26 males/23 females) with diabetic nephropathy (stage 2 or 3A), including normotensive patients, were the study subjects. The patients were treated with either an ACE inhibitor (23 patients) or candesartan (26 patients) for 11 +/- 3 months. The urinary excretion of albumin and urinary type IV collagen was measured.", 
    "642": "Posttreatment blood pressure tended to decrease, but such a decrease did not reach a statistically significant level, nor did it show any intergroup difference. The urinary albumin excretion was positively correlated with pretreatment mean blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, but the urinary type IV collagen excretion did not show such correlations. The urinary albumin excretion decreased significantly after treatment to a similar extent in both groups, whereas the urinary type IV collagen excretion decreased significantly only in the candesartan group.", 
    "643": "It was revealed that ACE inhibitors and candesartan reduced urinary albumin excretion to a similar extent in patients with diabetic nephropathy. From the results of the present study, it is inferred that the renoprotective effect of candesartan in diabetic nephropathy may partially differ from that of ACE inhibitors.",

    "645": "The experiments were carried out on anesthetized cats using the autohemoperfusion method in cerebral and peripheral vessels with a stable volume of blood. Transitional peripheral (lower limb) and brain ischemia was simulated by stopping the autohemoperfusion pump for 15 minutes, tying various anastomoses in the neck region, and reducing arterial blood pressure (ABP) to 40-30 mm Hg, followed by reinfusion of the shed blood.", 
    "646": "Intravenous administration of enalapril solution in a dosage of 0.25 mg kg-1 in the early phase of reperfusion (10 minutes into the postischaemic period) prevented the development of long-term \"no-reflow\"of cerebral blood flow, as observed in the controls. There was a 40.8+/-3.2% reduction of cerebrovascular tone, 39.3+/-3.1% in peripheral vessels, and 44.7+/-1.5% lower arterial blood pressure at the end of 120 minutes.", 
    "647": "Enalapril caused a reduction of cerebrovascular tone, completely eliminating the \"no-reflow\" syndrome after brain ischemia and somewhat potentiated the hyperperfusion phase. At the same time, the drug did not aggravate the general hypotension observed after ischemia in the controls.",

Both polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with ACE and PAI-1 expression levels respectively. A study group of 184 patients with a history of two or more consecutive unexplained spontaneous miscarriages was compared with a control group of 127 patients with uneventful term deliveries and no history of miscarriages.", 
    "650": "Our findings show: (i) homozygosity for the D allele of the ACE gene, which results in elevated PAI-1 concentrations and hypofibrinolysis, is associated with an elevated risk of RM; (ii) the combination of the D/D genotype with two 4G alleles of the PAI-1 promoter, which further increases PAI-1 plasma levels, is significantly more frequent in RM patients compared with controls.", 
    "651": "Based on these results, we recommend the incorporation of these two polymorphisms into the spectrum of thrombophilic mutations which should be analysed in individuals with recurrent spontaneous miscarriages. Patients homozygous for both the ACE D and PAI-1 4G alleles may benefit from the application of low molecular weight heparin as early as possible in the pregnancy in order to prevent uteroplacental microthromboses.",

Yet, recent trials suggest that hypertension is not adequately controlled in the majority of patients. The prevalence of hypertension increases with advancing age, as does the prevalence of comorbid conditions and the total number of medications taken. Multi-drug therapy, advancing age and comorbid conditions are also key risk factors for adverse drug reactions and drug interactions. In this review, the authors evaluate the most frequently used antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin II receptor Type 1 blockers and alpha-adrenergic blockers) with special reference to pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug interactions. As the spectrum of drugs prescribed is constantly changing, safety yesterday does not imply safety today and safety today does not imply safety tomorrow. Furthermore, therapeutic efficacy should not be neglected over concerns regarding drug interactions. Many patients are at risk of clinically relevant drug interactions involving antihypertensive drugs but, presently, even more patients may be at risk of suffering from the consequences of their inadequately treated hypertension. In this respect, the authors discuss controversial viewpoints on the overall clinical relevance of drug interactions occurring at the level of cytochrome P450 metabolism.",

    "660": "Prostaglandin (PG) E(2), a cyclooxygenase (COX) product, and angiotensin II are endogenous and have physiological roles in the body. On the other hand, an inducible isoform of COX (COX-2), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II, and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) are up-regulated in colon carcinoma and might have crucial roles in tumor growth and invasion. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of COX-2 inhibitor and drugs blocking the biological activities of angiotensin II [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)] on IGF-IR expression and tumor growth in vivo. We also investigated the effects of PGE(2), a major COX-2 product, in cancer cells and the effects of angiotensin II on IGF-IR expression and the underlying mechanism of action. In in vivo studies, tumor growth and IGF-IR expression were investigated in Colon 26 cells inoculated into BALB/c mice. In in vitro studies, the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on IGF-IR expression were analyzed in three colon cancer cell lines (Colon 26, HCA-7, and LS174T). IGF-II-induced cell growth and invasion were analyzed in Colon 26 cells in the presence and absence of NSAIDs (indomethacin and celecoxib) and angiotensin II. Celecoxib at the lowest effective dose for suppression of PG production (3 mg/kg) or an ACE inhibitor/ARB alone did not have a significant effect as compared with controls, although a high dose of celecoxib (>20 mg/kg) suppressed tumor growth. On the other hand, combination therapy with these two categories of drugs significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. Treatment with both celecoxib and an ACE inhibitor/ARB decreased IGF-IR expression levels in inoculated tumor cells. In in vitro studies, NSAIDs reduced IGF-IR expression in a dose-dependent manner in all three cell lines. NSAIDs also inhibited IGF-II-stimulated growth and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. PGE(2) or angiotensin II treatment reversed the NSAID-induced down-regulation of IGF-IR expression, growth, and invasion. PGE(2) and angiotensin II induced Akt phosphorylation, and LY294002 or wortmannin inhibited PGE(2)- or angiotensin II-induced IGF-IR expression, indicating that PGE(2) and angiotensin II both regulate IGF-IR expression by the same Akt/phosphatidylinositol-3 pathway. Thus, combination therapy with NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors targeting IGF-IR might be a novel and potentially promising strategy for the chemoprevention of colon cancer.", 
    "661": "Mortality and morbidity after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to exert a beneficial effect after AMI. We sought to evaluate the association between treatment with ACE inhibitors and 1-year outcome after AMI in diabetic and nondiabetic patients in a national survey. The study population was drawn from a national survey conducted in all coronary care units operating in Israel during a 5-month period in 1996, and included 2,179 patients with AMI: 533 diabetics (24%), 322 of whom received ACE inhibitors (60%) and 211 who did not; and 1,646 nondiabetics, 805 of whom received ACE inhibitors and 841 who did not. In both groups of patients, those treated with ACE inhibitors were older, included more women, more had a history of AMI, anterior wall AMI, or hypertension, and more had worse Killip class on admission. Diabetic patients treated with ACE inhibitors experienced lower 1-year mortality rates than diabetics not treated with ACE inhibitors (16.2% vs 18.8%, respectively; covariate adjusted hazard ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.74). In nondiabetic patients, however, ACE inhibitor treatment was not associated with a better outcome (10.2% vs 7.3%, respectively; covariate adjusted hazard ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.15). Thus, treatment with ACE inhibitors after AMI appears to be particularly beneficial in diabetic patients. The beneficial effect observed supports the widespread use of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients after AMI.", 
    "662": "Diabetes complications are common and almost triple the annual cost of managing diabetes. Microvascular complications are the major risk in type 1 diabetes, while macrovascular complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes. Control of hyperglycaemia (target HbA(1c) level < or = 7%) and hypertension (target blood pressure < or = 130/80 mmHg) prevents microvascular complications in both types of diabetes; a multifactorial approach, comprising behaviour modification and pharmacological therapy for all risk factors, reduces the development of micro- and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes. The benefit of treating dyslipidaemia is at least as great in the diabetic population as in the non-diabetic population. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and low-dose aspirin are indicated in people with diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors. Regular annual screening for diabetes complications allows treatable disease to be identified. Aggressive management of hyperglycaemia and other risk factors can prevent many complications",

Specific vascular, myopathic and neuropathic alterations have been suggested to be responsible for the excessive cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetes. These alterations manifest themselves clinically as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and/or sudden cardiac death. In order to contain the emerging epidemic of CVD in DM, diabetic patients should ideally have excellent glycemic control, a low normal blood pressure and low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and be taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and aspirin, which may go some way to containing the emerging epidemic of CVD in DM.",

Almost half the patients in the US with heart failure are women. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking are all more potent risk factors for the development of heart failure in women than in men. Important differences in presentation and mortality explain gender differences in the clinical course of heart failure. Overall mortality is lower for women than for men with symptomatic heart failure. Some but not all of this difference can be explained by a lower rate of ischemic heart disease. Standard treatments for congestive heart failure, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, have been shown to be equally efficacious in men and in women. Preliminary data on angiotensin II receptor blockers suggests equivalent benefit with further trial data awaited. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a form of heart failure unique to women, occurring in the last stages of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery. Approximately half of affected women regain normal ventricular function but for those who do not, the risk of recurrent symptomatic heart failure and mortality during subsequent pregnancies is high.",

    "687": "We retrospectively collected patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and benign nephrosclerosis who discontinued ACE inhibitor use. The relationship between the decline of renal function after the withdrawal and the influencing factors such as ACE gene polymorphism, blood pressure and proteinuria were evaluated using multiple regression analysis.", 
    "688": "Forty-two patients (initial serum creatinine 0.5 - 6.5 mg/dl) had been treated and discontinued ACE inhibitor use. Only patients with the II or DI genotypes of the ACE gene developed the deterioration of renal function, starting at 2 months after the withdrawal. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the level of proteinuria after the withdrawal, presence of the insertion of ACE gene and serum creatinine level at the time of withdrawal mainly influenced the decline of renal function after the withdrawal (adjusted R2 = 0.48).", 
    "689": "Withdrawal of ACE inhibitor causes the deterioration of renal function in patients with the II or DI genotypes, high proteinuria after the withdrawal, and high serum creatinine level at the withdrawal, which probably causes the rebound increase in serum ACE activity.", 
    "690": "Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by hypereosinophilia and a systemic vasculitis occurring inpatients with asthma and allergic rhinitis. Vasculitis commonly affects the lungs, the heart, the skin, and the peripheral nervous system. Cardiac involvement is characterized by acute and constrictive pericarditis, myocarditis and endocarditis, as well as ischemic cardiomyopathy. Endomyocardial fibrosis similar to Loeffler's syndrome has been rarely described. In the presented case, a 43 year old man with a history of allergy and asthma suffered from increasing dyspnea, fever, pulmonary infiltates and cardiomyopathy. Laboratory studies were notable for marked hypereosinophilia. In a bronchoscopic lavage and transbronchial biopsy eosinophilic infiltrates accompanied by vasculitis were found, Churg-Strauss syndrome was diagnosed. Echocardiogram showed endomyocardial deposits in the apex of the right ventricle, right ventricular function was normal particular in the basal segments. The left ventricle was slightly enlarged and left ventricular function was impaired. The diastolic mitral in-flow showed a restrictive pattern. Additionally, a pericardial effusion was observed without signs of tamponade. The patient received corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and cardiomyopathy-specific therapy and showed a marked improvement after 4 months.",

The article gives an overview of the recent knowledge in this field. Beside of summarizing physiological and the most important pathophysiological aspects of the RAS, as well as pharmacokinetic properties of the different angiotensin receptor blocker drugs used at present in Hungary, the potential differences in blocking of the converting enzyme and the angiotensin II receptors are also reviewed.",

    "693": "Based on outcome trials, guidelines for hypertension management recommend lower blood pressure (BP) goals using an individualized treatment strategy (IND) and referral to a specialist of patients uncontrolled after 6 months of treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of General Practitioners (GPs) in reaching the recommended BP goals using the IND, or a stepwise treatment strategy (STEP) as used in the outcome trials. Trained GPs were randomized to reach the BP goals within 6 months using the IND or a STEP strategy in untreated or treated uncontrolled hypertensives. In all, 24 GPs recruited 528 patients of whom 443 were analysed (mean age 65+/-9 years, 42% men, 70% treated, STEP/IND 12/12 GPs, 231/211 patients). After 6 months, 83% of the patients had reached the diastolic BP goal, whereas only 51% the systolic (P<0.0001 for difference). Factors associated with uncontrolled systolic BP were diabetes, age >60 years and triple antihypertensive therapy at baseline. A faster BP reduction was achieved during the first 3 months using the STEP strategy, but at the cost of using more drugs (combination therapy in 68/59% for STEP/IND, P=0.06). At 6 months similar rates of control were achieved with the two strategies. In conclusion, in primary care the diastolic BP goal can be reached within 6 months in the majority of patients, whereas systolic BP remains uncontrolled in 50% of the cases. The IND should be the recommended treatment strategy, but further investigation is required on the reasons for treatment failure and the optimal strategy for its improvement.",

Cells were treated with 1 mmol/L NaN(3) for 18 h. Benidipine concentration-dependently inhibited NaN(3)-induced cell death. The protective effect of benidipine was compared with those of amlodipine, nifedipine, candesartan, and captopril. Calcium antagonists exhibited a protective effect and the IC(50) values of benidipine, amlodipine, and nifedipine were 0.65, 90, and 65 nmol/L, respectively. NaN(3)-induced cell death was inhibited completely with the calpain inhibitor. It was considered that the sustained elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) might be implicated in NaN(3)-induced cell death. Benidipine, moreover, concentration-dependently preserved cellular ATP contents and maintained DeltaPsi the extent of the control level. In conclusion, benidipine exhibited the protective effect at an approximately 100-fold lower concentration than those of amlodipine and nifedipine in the NaN(3)-induced cardiac cell death model. It was considered that both the inhibition of Ca(2+) influx and the preservation of cellular ATP contents might play an important role in the protective effect of benidipine.", 
    "695": "Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has been described as a novel fibrotic mediator. CTGF is overexpressed in several kidney diseases and is induced by different factors involved in renal injury. Angiotensin II (AngII) participates in the pathogenesis of kidney damage, contributing to fibrosis; however, whether AngII regulates CTGF in the kidney has not been explored. Systemic infusion of AngII into normal rats for 3 days increased renal CTGF mRNA and protein levels. At day 7, AngII-infused rats presented overexpression of CTGF in glomeruli, tubuli, and renal arteries, as well as tubular injury and elevated fibronectin deposition. Only treatment with an AT(1) receptor antagonist, but not an AT(2), diminished CTGF and fibronectin overexpression and ameliorated tubular damage. In rats with immune complex nephritis, renal overexpression of CTGF was diminished by the ACE inhibitor quinapril, correlated with a diminution in fibrosis. In cultured renal cells (mesangial and tubular epithelial cells) AngII, via AT(1), increased CTGF mRNA and protein production, and a CTGF antisense oligonucleotide decreased AngII-induced fibronectin synthesis. Our data show that AngII regulates CTGF in the kidney and cultured in mesangial and tubular cells. This novel finding suggests that CTGF could be a mediator of the profibrogenic effects of AngII in the kidney.", 
    "696": "While disease management has been described as an important strategy for the care of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) in the managed care setting, little is known about the impact of this approach on overall health-related quality of life. In this study the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was administered to all patients entering CHF disease management at the time of program entry and at 1 year following entry. Scores on the eight subscales and the two composite scales were calculated and compared before and after. Patients were enrolled from a mixed-model health maintenance organization (HMO) with 34,740 Medicare + Choice enrollees residing in 38 counties in central and northeastern Pennsylvania. Two hundred sixty-eight continuously enrolled patients in an HMO-sponsored CHF disease state management program with completed baseline and follow-up SF-36 surveys were sampled. All patients entered into disease management received primary care based, nurse-directed education about CHF self-management including instruction on etiology of CHF, the importance of medication compliance, home care services if indicated, monitoring weight gain, increased understanding of the warning signs of worsening CHF, and coaching on strategies to contact a physician in a timely manner when CHF worsens. Nurses also facilitated for CHF guidelines among primary care physicians, including the need to obtain a baseline assessment of cardiac function, prescribe angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers when appropriate, and initiated appropriate specialist referral. Compared with enrollees who did not complete a pair of SF-36 surveys, the 268 respondents were younger and had a significantly higher rate of cardiac imaging as well as use of ACE inhibitors and beta blocker medications. Analysis of the SF-36 data revealed that three of the eight (Role Physical, General Health Perceptions, and Role Emotional) subscales increased in a statistically significant manner, as did the Mental Health Composite Score. No statistically significant declines in SF-36 scores were observed. Despite limitations to our study, we found disease management for patients with CHF can be associated with significant improvements in quality of life as measured by the SF-36. Compared with nonrespondents, respondents had a higher prevalence of cardiac imaging, ACE inhibitor use, and beta blocker medication use. Our findings are also limited by a lack of a control group with the possibility that the improvements we observed were unrelated to the disease management intervention. However, our findings and success with the use of this tool indicate the SF-36 can be an important part of the ongoing assessment of patients in a disease management program for CHF.", 
    "697": "High sodium intake blunts the efficacy of angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (ACEi), but the underlying mechanism is incompletely characterized. High sodium has been reported to increase vascular expression and vascular activity of ACE. To investigate whether high-dietary sodium-induced effects on vascular conversion of Ang I might be involved in the sodium-induced blunting of the response to ACEi, the authors studied the vasoconstrictor responses to Ang I and Ang II of isolated aortic rings from healthy rats on low dietary sodium (LS: 0.05% NaCl) and high dietary sodium (HS: 2.0% NaCl) after 3 weeks of ACEi (lisinopril 75 mg/L) or vehicle (CON). Blood pressure was similar in LS and HS in CON, but HS blunted the blood pressure response to ACEi. Functional conversion of Ang I was assessed as the difference in dose-response curves to Ang I and Ang II in parallel aortic rings. Sodium intake did not affect the dose-response curves to Ang I and Ang II in CON. In the ACEi groups, a significant difference was present between the curves for Ang I and Ang II on LS (deltaEC50, 6.7 nM; range, 2.2-13 nM; P < 0.01) but not on HS (deltaEC50: 1.3 nM; range, 0.0-4.1 nM, median [interquartile range], NS). Thus, HS blunts the ACEi-induced reduction of functional vascular Ang I conversion compared with LS. Whether the blunted functional vascular conversion is causally related to the blunted blood pressure response remains to be elucidated.",

Trials were identified from searches of 3 electronic databases (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE). Seven randomized controlled trials, with 8 comparison groups, were included. Lowering blood pressure or treating hypertension with a variety of antihypertensive agents reduced stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.92), nonfatal stroke (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.95), myocardial infarction (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.98), and total vascular events (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95). No effect was seen on vascular or all-cause mortality. Heterogeneity was present for several outcomes and was partly related to the class of antihypertensive drugs used; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics separately, and especially together, reduced vascular events, while beta-receptor antagonists had no discernable effect. The reduction in stroke was related to the difference in systolic blood pressure between treatment and control groups (P=0.002).",

    "701": "\"New pressor protein\" (NPP) derived from normal human plasma is an extra renal enzyme that shares strong sequence homology with human coagulation beta-FXIIa. Under our bioassay conditions, human NPP (10-20 microl plasma equivalent/ approximately 300 g rat iv) can raise the systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 40-50 mmHg, the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 15-20 mmHg, and the heart rate (HR) by 70-90 beats/min. Plasma epinephrine (of adrenal medullary origin) and norepinephrine rise by about 50- and 10-fold, respectively. Because beta-FXIIa is not normally associated with pressor properties, we endeavored to substantiate that the hypertensive effects of impure NPP preparations used in our experiments are attributable to their content of beta-FXIIa. We carried out comparisons with highly purified (>90%) commercial human beta-FXIIa and found that by gel filtration (Sephadex G-100 and G-75), NPP bioactivity appeared in the approximately 30-kDa elution zone, consistent with the molecular mass of beta-FXIIa. Retention time using fast-protein liquid chromatography anion exchange chromatography was identical. Molecular mass and comigration were confirmed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, and the recovered approximately 30-kDa protein bands yielded beta-FXIIa fragments identified by mass spectrometry. Matched doses of the NPP preparations produced dose-response curves very similar to those elicited by beta-FXIIa with respect to increments of SBP, DBP, and HR, whereas plasma catecholamine increments were generally comparable. We propose that beta-FXIIa is substantially, if not exclusively, responsible for the observed effects of our NPP preparations and that this points to a novel axis connecting the FXII coagulation cascade and the sympathoadrenal gland to other cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms.", 
    "702": "Congestive heart failure is a progressive disease with high morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Standard therapy for patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction now includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers. beta Blockers have been demonstrated to decrease mortality, reduce hospitalizations, improve functional class, decrease left ventricular dimensions, and improve ejection fraction in several large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. In addition to reducing deaths due to progressive heart failure, beta blockers also reduce the incidence of sudden death. Therapy with beta blockers can successfully be initiated in most patients with heart failure if recommended titration schedules are followed. beta Blockers are an important component of medical therapy for all stages of heart failure.",

Twenty-eight days after immunization of pig cardiac myosin, four groups rats were given 0.2 mg/kg (Q0.2, n = 11), 2 mg/kg (Q2, n = 11) or 20 mg/kg (Q20, n = 11) of quinapril or vehicle (V, n = 15) orally once a day. After 1 month, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), +/- dP/dt, area of myocardial fibrosis, and myocardial mRNA expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, collagen-III and fibronectin were measured. Four of 15 (27%) rats in V and two of 11 (18%) in Q0.2 died. None of the animals in Q2 or Q20 died. The LVEDP was higher and +/- dP/dt was lower in V (14.1 +/- 2.0 mmHg and +2409 +/- 150/-2318 +/- 235 mmHg/sec) than in age-matched normal rats (5.0 +/- 0.6 mmHg and +6173 +/- 191/-7120 +/- 74 mmHg/ sec; all p < 0.01). After quinapril treatment, LVEDP was decreased and +/- dP/dt was increased in a dose-dependent manner (10.8 +/- 1.8 mmHg and +3211 +/- 307/-2928 +/- 390 mmHg/sec in Q0.2, 9.4 +/- 1.5 mmHg and +2871 +/- 270/-2966 +/- 366 mmHg/sec in Q2, and 6.6 +/- 1.5 mmHg, and +3569 +/- 169/-3960 +/- 203 mmHg/sec in Q20). Increased expression levels of TGF-beta1, collagen-III and fibronectin mRNA in V were reduced in Q20. Quinapril improved survival rate and cardiac function in rats with dilated cardiomyopathy after myocarditis. Furthermore, myocardial fibrosis was regressed and myocardial structure returned to nearly normal in animals treated with quinapril.",

It is characterized by a markedly elevated efferent arteriolar resistance (RE), an elevated intraglomerular hydrostatic pressure (PG) and a markedly decreased renal plasma flow (RPF), and peritubular capillary flow (PTCF). A correction of such hemodynamic maladjustment can be accomplished by administering a combination of vasodilators (angiotensin receptor antagonist, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and calcium channel blocker) in 14 chronic glomerulonephritides with severe renal function impairment (mean serum creatinine 3.6 + 1.3 mg/dL). Doses titration aim for maximal renal perfusion effect (increased RPF, PTCF) or maximal renal function improvement (increased CCr, reduced FE Mg) usually higher than needed for maximal blood pressure reduction.

In these cases, serum creatinine (SCr) can be normalized by ACEI withdrawn. In some patients, it could be desirable to maintain the ACEI for the protection of the kidney and heart. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of Verapamil (V) on renal function added to patients with elevated SCr due to ACEI treatment. In 46 hypertensive patients without previous renal failure, in which ACEI treatment induced an acute increase in SCr (> or = 20% or 0.5 mg/dL), ACEI treatment was maintained and 180 mg/day of V was added for 12 weeks. Those patients showing further SCr increase or no BP control at four weeks were withdrawn. Patients under BP control were moved on the combination V 180 + Trandolapril 2 mg/day for eight weeks more. SCr decreased from 136 +/- 49 micromol/L at baseline to 126 +/- 49 at 12 weeks after adding V (p < 0.001) and to 111 +/- 31 micromol/L at 20 weeks (p < 0.01).

The technical advances for implantation include preformed guide sheaths to cannulate the CS, over the wire leads with passive fixation mechanism, and surgical placement methods. Device-specific CRT features include optimizing heart failure through insurance of a high percentage of pacing, heart failure monitoring, atrioventricular and interventricular timing, and avoiding double ventricular sensing. Furthermore, arrhythmic co-morbidities of heart failure such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias can also be managed. Recent prospective trials suggest that there is a 30% reduction in heart failure hospitalization with CRT, and preliminary results suggest a survival benefit with CRT and implantable cardioverter defibrillator over optimal medical therapy.",

Renal fibronectin expression increased in diabetic SHR (125 +/- 13 densitometric unit) as compared to the controls (51 +/- 9, p < 0.0001), and decreased (p < 0.0001 vs. diabetic SHR) with captopril (32 +/- 8), losartan (27 +/- 4) and triple therapy (35 +/- 6).", 
    "726": "The prevention of hypertension in diabetic SHR by captopril, losartan or triple therapy was equally efficacious in impeding increase of albuminuria and the expression of renal fibronectin.

    "728": "A group of 45 OZR were uninephrectomized to accelerate renal damage, and divided into three groups: two experimental groups (IRBE and OMA) treated with 50 and 40 mg/kg/d, respectively; and the control group (CG). At the end of the 8-month follow-up period, animals were killed and the remnant kidney was removed for histologic study and to evaluate the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression.", 
    "729": "Both therapies reduced blood pressure (BP) versus CG (P <.001). Moreover, systolic BP was significantly lower in the OMA group than in the IRBE group (P <.001). Also, both treatments significantly lowered the urinary albumin excretion (P <.001). The OMA treatment exhibited lower values than the IRBE treatment (P <.05). The kidney TGF-beta1 expression was reduced by both treatments to a similar level. The correlation between systolic BP and glomerulosclerosis (GS) is very high (r = 0.90; P <.0001). Also, a high correlation was observed between GS and proteinuria (r = 0.79, P <.0001). The correlation between systolic BP and proteinuria was weaker (r = 0.69; P <.01).", 
    "730": "These data suggest that both therapies are effective in ameliorating the progression of renal damage in this experimental model. Omapatrilat affords greater long-term renoprotection than irbesartan, mainly due to its potent effect in reducing systolic BP.", 
    "731": "Microvascular remodeling contributes to increased cardiovascular risk in hypertension. The dual angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor omapatrilat improves small artery remodeling in hypertension. The aim of the present study was to compare effects of omapatrilat to the ACE inhibitor fosinopril and the AT(1) antagonist irbesartan on the coronary microvasculature in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Ten-week-old SHR were treated for 10 weeks with omapatrilat (20 or 40 mg/kg/d), irbesartan (50 mg/kg/d), or fosinopril (20 mg/kg/d). Arterioles and capillaries were identified in the myocardium by immunolabeling. After 10 weeks, systolic blood pressure (BP) was significantly reduced in treated versus untreated SHR (P <.01). Myocardial arteriolar density/mm(2) was higher (P <.05) in untreated SHR versus Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), and was reduced by omapatrilat (at both high and low doses) and by fosinopril (P <.01). Irbesartan decreased only subepicardial arteriolar density (P <.05). Myocardial capillary density/mm(2) was decreased in untreated SHR versus WKY (P <.01), associated with increase in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and cardiomyocyte-to-capillary ratio, and a decrease in myocyte density. Omapatrilat (at both high and low doses) resulted in increased capillary density, decreased myocyte hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte to capillary ratio, and increased myocyte density (P <.01). Fosinopril and irbesartan reduced myocyte hypertrophy of SHR, but had no effect on capillary density. Dual ACE/NEP inhibition was more effective than ACE inhibition or AT(1) antagonism in improving microvascular and cardiomyocyte remodeling in the hypertensive heart. This suggests a role for NEP inhibition added to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system that may explain the greater efficacy of omapatrilat.",

Subjects referred for resistant hypertension were evaluated with an early morning plasma renin activity, 24-h urinary aldosterone and sodium during a high dietary salt ingestion. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was confirmed with a renin activity <1.0 ng/mL/h, urinary aldosterone >12 mug/24 h and urinary sodium >200 mEq/24 h. After biochemical evaluation, spironolactone (12.5 to 25 mg/d) was added to each subject's antihypertensive regimen. If blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled, the dose of spironolactone was titrated up to 50 mg/d. Follow-up BP was determined at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.", 
    "734": "A total number of 76 subjects were included in the analysis, 34 of whom had biochemical primary aldosteronism. Low-dose spironolactone was associated with an additional mean decrease in BP of 21 +/- 21/10 +/- 14 mm Hg at 6 weeks and 25 +/- 20/12 +/- 12 mm Hg at 6-month follow-up. The BP reduction was similar in subjects with and without primary aldosteronism and was additive to the use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics.",

    "736": "Functional angiotensin II receptors have been documented in cardiac fibroblasts as well as an intracardiac aldosterone system that responds to short- and long-term physiological stimuli. In vitro, angiotensin II increased cardiac fibroblast-mediated collagen synthesis and mRNA levels of collagen type I, type III, pro-alpha1 (I) collagen, pro-alpha1 (III) collagen and fibronectin, and inhibited matrix metalloproteinase I activity. The angiotensin II-stimulated secretion and expression of collagen was completely abolished by AT1 receptor antagonism, but not affected by AT2 receptor antagonism. In vivo, chronic infusion of angiotensin II increased the collagen volume fraction in the ventricles. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT1 receptor antagonism, but not AT2 receptor antagonism, reduced collagen deposition in the myocardium in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in rat myocardium following myocardial infarction. During chronic aldosterone infusion in uninephrectomized rats on a high-salt diet, a marked accumulation of interstitial and to a lesser extent perivascular collagen occurs in the heart in both ventricles. The cardiac fibrosis in this aldosterone model is prevented by spironolactone. During the continuous infusion of aldosterone in the rat, the appearance of fibrosis was delayed and started 4 weeks after the beginning of the infusion, which argues against a direct effect of aldosterone. The mechanism of aldosterone-salt-induced cardiac fibrosis possibly involves angiotensin II acting through upregulated AT1 receptors and the cardiac AT1 receptor is the target for aldosterone. An accumulation of collagen in the heart has also been found in patients with adrenal adenomas and during chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system such as in surgically-induced unilateral renal ischemia, unilateral renal artery banding or renovascular hypertension. Spironolactone prevents aortic collagen accumulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In patients with stable chronic heart failure, spironolactone treatment in addition to diuretics and ACE inhibition reduced circulating levels of procollagen type III N-terminal aminopeptide. Also, in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study, spironolactone coadministered with conventional therapy of ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics and digitalis in patients with symptomatic heart failure defined as NYHA classes III-IV, reduced total mortality by 30%.", 
    "737": "Elderly patients with unstable angina pectoris/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction should be hospitalized. Precipitating factors should be identified and corrected. Electrocardiogram monitoring is important. Aspirin should be given as soon as possible and continued indefinitely. Clopidogrel should given for up to 9 months in patients in whom an early noninterventional approach is planned or in whom a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is planned. Clopidogrel should be withheld for 5-7 days in patients in whom elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS) is planned. A platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor should also be given in addition to aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin in patients in whom cardiac catheterization and PCI are planned. Patients whose symptoms are not fully relieved with three 0.4-mg sublingual nitroglycerin tablets or spray taken 5 minutes apart and the initiation of an intravenous beta blocker should be treated with continuous intravenous nitroglycerin. Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be given and continued indefinitely. The benefit of long-acting nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is limited to symptom control. Intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation should be used for severe ischemia that is continuing or occurs frequently despite intensive medical therapy or for hemodynamic instability. Statins should be used if the serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is >or=100 mg/dl and continued indefinitely. Enoxaparin is preferable to intravenous unfractionated heparin in the absence of renal failure and unless CABGS is planned within 24 hours. Thrombolysis is not beneficial. High-risk patients should have an early invasive strategy with CABGS or PCI performed depending on the coronary artery anatomy, left ventricular function, presence or absence of diabetes, and findings on noninvasive testing. Following hospital discharge, patients should have intensive risk factor modification with cessation of smoking, maintenance of blood pressure below 135/85 mmHg, indefinite use of statins if needed to maintain the serum LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl, intensive control of diabetes, maintenance of optimal weight, and daily exercise. Patients should be treated indefinitely with aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors and with clopidogrel for up to 9 months. Nitrates should be given for ischemic symptoms. Hormonal therapy should not be given to postmenopausal women.", 
    "738": "In the period from 1990 to 2002, 201 patients with suicidal antihypertensive drugs poisoning were treated, including 138 women and 63 men from 15 to 84 (mean 36) years old. The main causes of suicides were various kinds of depression (63%) as well as psychopathy and/or sociopathy (16%) and schizophrenia (10%). Twenty eight patients attempted repeatedly to commit suicide. Thirty six persons were poisoned by only antihypertensive drugs, in 165 remaining cases intoxications were mixed including antihypertensive and other different medications. beta-blockers (38.3%), calcium channel blockers (34.8%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (24.3%) and diuretics (2.5%) were used in suicidal attempts. There were no suicidal poisonings with angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonists, alpha 1-blockers and imidazole receptor agonists. In the examined group three patients died of cardiogenic shock, electromechanical dissociation and secondary acute respiratory failure resistant to therapy. The drugs used in these cases were propranolol, amlodipine, theophylline, captopril, doxepine, propafenone, furosemide, methimazole and alcohol. Mortality rate in antihypertensive drug poisonings was 1.5%.", 
    "739": "Equivalent long-term effects on the kidney are attributed to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB). Nevertheless, it is unknown to which degree effects of these compounds on individual inflammatory mediators, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), are comparable. On the basis of structural and functional differences, it was hypothesized that ACEI and ARB differentially regulate MMP activity. In a randomized, prospective crossover trial, the effect of an ACEI (fosinopril; 20 mg/d) and of an ARB (irbesartan; 150 mg/d) on MMP activity was evaluated. Ten hypertensive patients with glomerulonephritis and normal or mildly reduced creatinine clearance were studied. MMP activity and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) levels were analyzed in serum and urine: without therapy, with ACEI, with ARB, and with both agents combined. Treatment periods continued for 6 wk separated by periods of 4 wk each without therapy. Untreated patients with glomerulonephritis displayed distinctively higher serum levels of MMP-2 but much lower MMP-1/-8/-9 concentrations compared with healthy control subjects. Immunohistology of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in kidney biopsy specimen was accordingly. However, these patients excreted higher amounts of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in urine than healthy control subjects, possibly reflecting ongoing glomerular inflammation. In patients with glomerulonephritis, ACEI significantly reduced overall MMP serum activity to 25%, whereas ARB did not show any effect. Activities of MMP-1/-2/-8/-9 were also significantly inhibited by fosinopril but not by irbesartan. Levels of TIMP-1/-2 remained unaffected. In conclusion, ACEI and ARB differentially regulate MMP activity, which may ultimately have consequences in certain types of MMP-dependent glomerulonephritis.", 
    "740": "The impact of polymorphisms in the genes coding for angiotensinogen (M235T), ACE (ID), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (A(1166)-->C) on decline in GFR and doubling of s-creatinine or development of ESRD in patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN) was tested. From 1985, all patients (n = 169) who had established diabetic nephropathy and were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-I) were identified consecutively at Steno Diabetes Center. Patients were followed for a median of 6 yr (range, 3 to 15 yr), with nine (range, three to 29) measurements of GFR ((51)Cr-EDTA). In a Cox proportional hazards model corrected for other risk factors, the D allele (ACE/ID) was associated with time to doubling of s-creatinine/ESRD (rate ratio, 1.81 per allele; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 3.03; P = 0.02). A new interaction hypothesis was generated demonstrating that the following variables were associated with accelerated decline in GFR: albuminuria (estimate, 2.12 ml/min per yr per 10-fold increase in albuminuria; P < 0.001), mean BP (estimate, 0.88 ml/min per yr per 10 mmHg; P = 0.02), hemoglobin A(1c) (estimate, 0.54 min/min per yr per 1%; P = 0.02), and number of M (M235T)/D (ID)/A (A(1166)-->C) alleles (estimate, 0.45 ml/min per yr per allele; P = 0.049). Number of M/D/A alleles also influenced time to doubling of s-creatinine or ESRD. In this study of patients with type 1 diabetes, the D allele of the ACE/ID polymorphism in addition to nongenetic risk factors independently accelerated progression of DN during ACE-I. Interaction between polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin system also influenced the loss of kidney function. This new genetic interaction model needs to be confirmed in future studies.", 
    "741": "Interventions to block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) halt the progression of renal lesions in renal damage models. It has recently also been reported that established glomerulosclerosis can be reversed by pharmacologic blockade of the RAS. It was the aim of this study to confirm that high doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reverse established glomerulosclerosis and to extend the findings by providing quantitative information on glomerular geometry, podocytes and other glomerular cells, renal vessels and tubulointerstitial tissue. Male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to subtotal surgical renal ablation (SNX) (n = 27) or sham operation (n = 31) and fed using a pair-feeding protocol. Eight weeks after surgery, rats were either sacrificed or allocated to two arms: enalapril treatment (48 mg/kg body wt per day administered in the drinking fluid for 4 wk) or no treatment. Renal morphology was evaluated after 8 or 12 wk, respectively, by stereology in tissue fixed by pressure-controlled perfusion. Both systolic BP and albumin excretion rate were significantly higher in SNX compared with sham-operated controls. They were significantly reduced in SNX after delayed enalapril treatment. The glomerulosclerosis (GSI), tubulointerstitial (TII), and vascular (VI) damage indices were significantly higher in all SNX groups than in sham-operated controls. At the end of the experiment (12 wk after SNX) GSI, TII, and VI were significantly lower in SNX with delayed enalapril treatment (0.77 +/- 0.18, 0.63 +/- 0.19 and 0.43 +/- 0.16, respectively) compared with untreated SNX (1.64 +/- 0.14, 1.16 +/- 0.34 and 0.67 +/- 0.29, respectively). GSI, TII, and VI were also significantly lower in SNX with delayed enalapril treatment compared with SNX sacrificed without treatment 8 wk after SNX. The same was true for glomerular volume. The number of podocytes was not affected by SNX, but podocyte volume was increased. Both indices remained unaffected by treatment. The numbers of cells within the mesangium and endothelial cells per glomerulus were significantly lower in SNX after delayed enalapril treatment compared with untreated SNX. These results strongly suggest regression of preexisting lesions, i.e., glomerular, tubular, and vascular remodeling as well as reversal of glomerular hypertrophy by ACE inhibitor treatment. The study confirms that high-dose ACE inhibitor treatment causes partial reversal of glomerular as well as interstitial lesions in subtotally nephrectomized rats.", 
    "742": "Inhibition of nitric oxide synthases causes systemic hypertension and renal injury in rats. Our objective was to examine whether omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor that inhibits both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase, could induce better regression of renal injury than ACE inhibitor alone. Ten groups of rats were studied. They were fed either a normal (0.8% NaCl) or a high (4% NaCl) sodium diet. Eight of these groups received NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 20 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) in their drinking water. After 4 weeks, 1 group on each diet was killed and considered the L-NAME group, whereas the others received L-NAME alone, captopril (200 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) plus L-NAME, or omapatrilat (80 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) plus L-NAME for 4 additional weeks. In rats receiving L-NAME alone for 8 weeks, the mortality rate was approximately 90%, irrespective of the diet. In contrast, all rats survived in the captopril and the omapatrilat groups. In rats fed a normal-sodium diet, captopril and omapatrilat normalized systolic blood pressure and induced a complete regression of renal injury. Creatinine clearance and proteinuria were also normalized. In the high-sodium-diet groups, both treatments were less efficient: blood pressure remained elevated, and the regression of renal fibrosis was only partial. Although proteinuria decreased significantly with captopril or omapatrilat, creatinine clearance remained lower than in the controls. These results demonstrate that, in nitric oxide-deficient rats fed a normal-sodium diet, ACE and vasopeptidase inhibitors exhibit a marked renoprotective effect, whereas these treatments are less efficient in rats fed a high-sodium diet.",

The FTIR and Raman spectra demonstrated that the organotin(IV) moieties interact with the [S] atom of the ligand, while the other coordination sites are the carboxylate and the amide -CO groups. M\u00f6ssbauer Delta data showed that the diorganotin(IV) compounds adopt slightly distorted trigonal-bipyramidal (tbp) geometry. A single-crystal X-ray study was performed on the compound Me(2)Sn(cap): the Sn atom is five-coordinated in a distorted tbp environment, with two [O] atoms in the axial positions and the [S] and two [C] atoms in the equatorial (eq) plane. Each cap ligand coordinates to two different Sn atoms, and infinite zigzag chains are formed, directed parallel to each other and to the b axis of the unit cell. NMR (CDCl(3)) of the Me(2)Sn(IV) and n-Bu(2)Sn(IV) complexes indicated the presence of different oligomeric species.", 
    "744": "Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) have been postulated to play a role in the development of both nephropathy and large vessel disease in diabetes. However, it is still not clear which AGE subtypes play a pathogenetic role and which of several AGE receptors mediate AGE effects on cells. This review summarises the renoprotective effect of inhibitors of AGE formation, including aminoguanidine, and of cross-link breakers, including ALT-711, on experimental diabetic nephropathy and on mesenteric vascular hypertrophy. It also demonstrates similar effects of aminoguanidine and ramipril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) on fluorescent and immunoassayable AGE levels, renal protein kinase C activity, nitrotyrosine expression, lysosomal function, and protein handling in experimental diabetes. These findings indicate that inhibition of the renin angiotensin system blocks both upstream and downstream pathways leading to tissue injury. We postulate that the chemical pathways leading to advanced glycation endproduct formation and the renin angiotensin systems may interact through the generation of free radicals, induced both by glucose and angiotensin II. There is also evidence to suggest that AGE-dependent pathways may play a role in the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the diabetic kidney. This effect is mediated through RAGE and is TGF-beta and CTGF-dependent.",

Bilirubin levels peaked at 15.5 and 5 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase values peaked at 957 and 507 U/L. Aminotransferase levels were mildly elevated. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and ultrasonography showed no bile duct obstruction. Liver biopsies from the jaundiced patients were similar, with cholestasis, duct necrosis, and extravasation of bile, ductular proliferation, and portal inflammation. Cholestasis improved in 1 patient 6 weeks after stopping ramipril and was prolonged for 14 months in the other, in whom biliary cirrhosis was present on biopsy. The third patient developed hepatitis without jaundice 3 weeks after starting ramipril; symptoms resolved after stopping the drug.

    "750": "When observed in elderly hypertensive patients, increased pulse pressure (PP) and arterial stiffness are known to be independent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) leads to left ventricular hypertrophy, while decreased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) results in decreased coronary circulation. It is known that increased arterial stiffness is the major cause of increased PP. Thus basic morbid states of cardiac failure or ischemic heart diseases are more likely to develop in elderly hypertensive patients with increased PP and arterial stiffness, and there is need of antihypertensive drugs that decrease these effects in elderly hypertensives. In this study, we compared the effects of an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB: valsartan), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I: temocapril), and long-acting Ca antagonists (L- and N-type Ca channel blocker: cilnidipine; and L-type Ca channel blocker: nifedipine CR) on PP and arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity in elderly hypertensive patients for 3 months. The ARB yielded the largest reductions in PP and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), followed by the ACE-I and L- and N-type Ca channel blocker, while the L-type Ca channel blocker yielded no improvement. The effects on arterial stiffness and PP thus varied among the drug characteristics. Although ARB achieved the largest reduction in baPWV, this decrease was not associated with any reductions in PP, SBP, DBP, or mean blood pressure, as were the baPWV-decreases achieved by the other drugs, suggesting that ARB may further reduce the risk of arteriosclerosis in elderly hypertensive patients by decreasing arterial stiffness in addition to its antihypertensive effect.",

    "755": "The present study was designed to examine the relaxant and anticonstrictive effects of berberine in the isolated thoracic aorta in rats. Intravenous injection of berberine lowered the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of anesthesized rats in a dose-dependent manner. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activities were inhibited significantly by the addition of berberine in a dose-dependent manner of which the IC50 value of berberine for ACE was 42 micrograms/ml (125 microM). In the endothelium-intact rings, angiotensin I-induced contraction was markedly attenuated by prior exposure of aortic rings to berberine. Treatment of the intact aortic rings with berberine (10 micrograms/ml) increased the NOx and cGMP productions relative to the vehicle-treated group. Berberine induced a dose-dependent relaxation in phenylephrine-precontracted aortic rings, but NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-pretreated intact aortic rings or functional removal of the endothelium attenuated the berberine-induced relaxation without an effect on maximum response. These results suggest that berberine has a hypotensive effect, at least in part, via the inhibition of ACE and direct release of NO/cGMP in the vascular tissues.",

Risk factors for a poor prognosis include severe proteinuria, hypertension, older age, male gender and impaired renal function. Therapy should include an ACE-Inhibitor and/or angiotensin-II receptor blocker to lower proteinuria (blood pressure < or =130/80 mmHg). The majority of patients should be observed for six months whilst receiving conservative treatment before deciding about an immunosuppressive approach. The debate over its management continues today.

Age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats genetically related to SHR were used as a control. Aggregability of RBC in hypertensive rats was significantly higher than in control WKY animals. Quinapril (100 microg/kg) administered i.p. for 8 days improved RBC aggregability in normotensive rats but surprisingly not in SHR animals. Beneficial effect of quinapril on RBC aggregation observed in normotensive animals did not occur when this drug was injected in combination with aspirin (1 or 50 mg/kg) or with indomethacin (20 mg/kg) or with L-NAME (10 mg/kg). However, much the same damaging effects on RBC aggregability were observed when aspirin, indomethacin or L-NAME were each administered into normotensive animals without quinapril. In contrast with normotensive rats, aggregability of RBC in SHR was not affected either by quinapril or by indomethacin and by L-NAME, given separately or in combination. The only compound significantly worsening RBC aggregability in SHR was aspirin but this effect was not dose-dependent. Quinapril-induced improvement of RBC aggregability in normotensive rats (but not in SHR) was completely abolished by simultaneous administration of B2 receptor antagonist icatibant and successfully mimicked by 8 days of treatment with bradykinin. In vitro aggregability of RBC isolated from WKY was not affected by previous incubation (30 min at 37 degrees C) with quinapril, indomethacin or L-NAME. Only aspirin (3 mM) significantly increased RBC aggregability as compared to placebo. It is concluded that under physiological conditions quinapril efficiently inhibits RBC aggregability and this effect is modulated by secretion of endothelial mediators, mainly prostacyclin and nitric oxide. In hypertension quinapril, in spite of lowering of arterial blood pressure, is unable to display its beneficial effects on RBC aggregability possibly due to the hypertension-induced/accompanied dysfunction of vascular endothelium. Aspirin revealed unique erythrocyte damaging properties, presumably independent of inhibition of cyclooxygenase but related to a direct membrane protein acetylation.",

Some data suggest the possibility that ACE-inhibitors may be less beneficial in women as compared to men. Beta-blockers seem to be effective both in women and men.

Patients admitted to cardiology units were younger (56.3% >70 years vs 76.2%, P <.0001), had more severe symptoms (NYHA IV 35% vs 29%, P =.00014), and more often underwent evaluation of ventricular function (89.3% vs 54.8%, P <.0001) and coronary angiography (7.5% vs 0.9%, P <.0001) than those admitted to medical units. Moreover, they were more often prescribed beta-blockers (17.8% vs 8.7%, P <.0001). However, prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (78.7% vs 81.5%, P = not significant [NS]) and inhospital mortality (5.2% vs 5.9%, P = NS) were similar. A 6-month follow-up visit was performed in 56.4% of cases (68.2% of cardiology vs 49.4% of medicine patients, P <.0001); 6-month readmission (43.7% vs 45.4%, P = NS) and mortality (13.9% vs 16.7%, P = NS) rates were similar.",

    "775": "Patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) face a high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, repeat hospitalizations, heart failure, and mortality. There is compelling scientific evidence that antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering therapy reduce these risks in patients with acute MI. Despite this evidence and national guidelines, a number of studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of patients with acute MI is not being treated with these guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapies when receiving conventional care. The demonstration that initiation of cardiovascular protective medications, including lipid-lowering therapy, prior to hospital discharge for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events results in a marked increase in treatment rates, improved long-term patient compliance, and better clinical outcomes has led to the revision of national guidelines to endorse this approach as the standard of care. Physicians have been reluctant to initiate beta-blockers in post-MI patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction and/or heart failure symptoms, and this reluctance has contributed to the treatment gap. Recent studies suggest that when the beta-blocker carvedilol is initiated in acute-MI patients with left ventricular dysfunction with or without symptoms of heart failure prior to hospital discharge, it is safe and effective and improves clinical outcomes. Adopting in-hospital initiation of cardiovascular protective medications as the standard of care for patients hospitalized with acute MI could dramatically improve treatment rates and thus substantially reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events and hospitalizations and prolong life in the large number of patients hospitalized each year.", 
    "776": "The prognosis for patients who suffer myocardial infarctions (MIs) is poor, with 22% of male and 46% of female survivors being disabled by heart failure within 6 years. Many well-established risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality post-MI are closely linked to the metabolic syndrome and associated with over-activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. Results from numerous large-scale clinical endpoint trials have shown that blocking the deleterious effects of these systems with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist significantly reduces the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events in post-MI patients. Results from 1 recent study of the beta-blocker, carvedilol, have shown further that these benefits extend to high-risk patients with either diabetes or hypertension.", 
    "777": "The CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control in Left Ventricular Dysfunction) trial established that the beta-blocker carvedilol reduces the risk of death in patients with left ventricular dysfunction post myocardial infarction, whether or not the infarct is complicated by clinical heart failure. Thus, the utility of the beta-blocker carvedilol is confirmed in the modern era as an adjunct to revascularization, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and statins. In addition, the results prompt us to review the prior studies of beta-blockers postinfarction. Critical review of CAPRICORN and earlier beta-blocker studies suggests that specific beta-blockers should be matched to specific clinical scenarios. The COMET (Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial) study reinforces this view by establishing that beta-blockers are not simply interchangeable agents.", 
    "778": "In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (MI), the early use of intravenous beta-blockade followed by short-term oral administration in the absence of reperfusion therapy has shown a modest reduction in mortality. In contrast, major reductions in mortality and reinfarction have been shown when beta-blockers have been used soon after an acute MI and continued long-term. These benefits were observed in trials conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the widespread use of reperfusion therapies, antiplatelet agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; those trials excluded patients with postischemic heart failure. Recently, the CAPRICORN trial has shown a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and reinfarction in post-MI patients with systolic dysfunction, in response to carvedilol. In spite of compelling evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers in the post-MI setting, data published by the National Cooperative Cardiovascular Project have shown that fewer than half of all post-MI patients receive beta-blockers as long-term therapy. It appears that post-MI patients with perceived contraindications, such as advanced age, diabetes, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and/or chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, may derive a substantial benefit from the use of beta-blockers. Given the considerable evidence from randomized clinical trials, the use of beta-blockers is recommended in all post-MI patients without a contraindication, particularly in those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.", 
    "779": "An understanding of the process of left ventricular (LV) remodeling has led to greater knowledge of the pathophysiology of heart failure syndrome. This article examines the relationship between LV remodeling and clinical outcomes of heart failure syndrome from several different perspectives. The studies cited suggest that the post-myocardial infarction process is related to and associated with long-term progression of LV dysfunction, heart failure symptoms, and mortality. It is also demonstrated that drug therapies that slow or reverse the remodeling process appear to have favorable natural history effects in the short term as well as during long-term therapy.", 
    "780": "Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials has provided compelling evidence to support the use of beta blockers in most patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. There is little disagreement about the mortality benefit provided by adding beta blockers to standard therapy, which may include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and sometimes digoxin. A few areas are still controversial. The authors review the available literature encompassing four of those controversial areas: 1) the comparability among beta blockers; 2) the utility of beta blockers among patients with New York Heart Association class I and class IV heart failure symptoms; 3) the impact of race on the effectiveness of beta blockers; and 4) the safety and efficacy of beta blockers among patients on concomitant therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or spironolactone.", 
    "781": "Large-scale outcome trials have demonstrated that blood pressure reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) is associated with reduced cardiovascular complications in hypertension. Comparative trials against conventional drugs and between ACE inhibitors and CCBs have failed to reveal conclusive differences in cause-specific outcomes. Studies in high-risk patients suggest that ACE inhibitors are superior to CCBs and other drugs in protection against cardiovascular events and renal disease. Very long-term prospectively collected observational data from the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic and the UK General Practice Research Database strongly support an advantage of ACE inhibitors over CCBs for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Considering all the available information, it can be concluded that the use of CCBs in the routine therapy of hypertension cannot be recommended while wider use of ACE inhibitors, along with low-dose diuretics and beta blockers, appears justified.", 
    "782": "Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers comprise a class of powerful, well-tolerated, and safe antihypertensive agents that are widely used either alone or as a key component of combination therapy for hypertension. Peripheral edema, particularly of the lower limbs, is one of the most common adverse effects of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and may result in the need for dose reduction or drug withdrawal, both of which can adversely affect antihypertensive efficacy. Optimal use of these important drugs will involve careful dosing and sensitivity to strategies to diminish the likelihood of edema. Diuretics, either loop or thiazide, are usually not effective in alleviating pedal edema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in combination with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be helpful in this regard. Some calcium channel blockers may be less likely to cause pedal edema compared with others. This paper will review existing explanations of why there may be differences. A favorable tolerability profile is of particular importance for an antihypertensive medication, since hypertension is a chronic disorder necessitating long-term treatment and patient compliance.", 
    "783": "Effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment depends not only on drugs that avoid or minimize symptomatic side effects but also on therapy that has a positive effect on quality of life. This study assessed the effect on quality of life of a contemporary agent (an angiotensin receptor blocker) and evaluated the validity and practicality of using a quality-of-life instrument in the practice-based setting. A total of 2716 hypertensive patients, either untreated or on single-agent therapy, were started on or switched to 40 mg telmisartan for 6 weeks; in patients whose blood pressures remained above 130/85 mm Hg after 2 weeks, the dose was increased to 80 mg for the remaining 4 weeks of treatment. Quality of life was measured by patient self-administration of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (GWBI) at baseline and at the end of the study. Sixty-eight percent (n=1858) of patients treated with telmisartan fully completed both GWBI tests; the test score increased by 5.2+/-0.3 (p<0.0001) from 77.7+/-0.4. This improvement was observed across all six emotional and health subscales of the GWBI. White and black patients, those aged <65 or >/=65 years, and men and women had similar increases, though the baseline value in women was sharply lower (p<0.001) than in men. The GWBI rose more in patients whose blood pressure was controlled by treatment (<140/90 mm Hg) than in noncontrolled patients (6.1 vs. 4.1, p<0.0001); for all patients the decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures produced by telmisartan correlated significantly (p<0.001 for each) with the increases in the GWBI scores. Controlling blood pressure appears to be an important element in improving subjective health perceptions of hypertensive patients.",

Enalapril (10 mg/kg per day) was administered in the drinking water and coincided with the injection of vehicle or streptozotocin. Two to 3 months later, we examined responses of pial arterioles to nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent agonists (acetylcholine and ADP) and a NOS-independent agonist (nitroglycerin). After these functional studies, we harvested cerebral microvessels for Western blot analysis of eNOS protein.", 
    "786": "We found that acetylcholine- and ADP-induced dilatation of pial arterioles was impaired in diabetic compared with nondiabetic rats. In addition, while enalapril did not alter responses in nondiabetic rats, enalapril prevented diabetes-induced impairment of NOS-dependent vasodilatation. Furthermore, eNOS protein was higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic rats, and enalapril did not produce a further increase in eNOS protein in enalapril-treated diabetic rats compared with untreated diabetic rats.",

Although ACE inhibitors remain first-line drugs in the treatment of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, clinical evidence suggests that a newer class of agents--angiotensin II receptor blockers--may provide additional benefit by blocking the adverse effects of angiotensin II more completely. An improved adverse-effect profile also makes angiotensin II receptor blockers appropriate in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. Clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers on the combined endpoints of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone has additive benefits in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor.

In this study, we compared the relative benefits of long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) to a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist. Four groups of obese inbred Zucker rats were studied over a 6-month observation period; untreated animals, rats treated with ACEI alone, rats treated with PPARgamma agonist alone, and rats treated with a combination of ACEI and PPARgamma agonist. PPARgamma agonist treatment normalized plasma glucose and led to massive increases in body weight. Both ACEI and PPARgamma agonist were effective in reducing the proteinuria and glomerular and tubular kidney damage. However, the PPARgamma agonist exerted superior renal protection compared with ACEI, in this model of spontaneously occurring chronic renal disease in the diabetic, obese inbred Zucker rat. Of note, although ACEI lowered blood pressure, there was no difference in glomerular blood pressure in any group at the end of the study. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was improved by ACEI with a borderline effect of PPARgamma agonist alone. A mild additive protection on GFR and tubulointerstitial damage was seen with the combination. Based on the literature it is likely that the superior protection by PPARgamma agonist versus glomerular and tubular damage as well as proteinuria extends beyond glycemic and lipidmic control and also reflects direct, protective intrarenal actions of the PPARgamma agonists.",

Two-week captopril exposures were sufficient to confer maximal protection. Only vehicle-treated EC demonstrated apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing and DNA laddering. By RT-PCR, the starvation marker p202 was upregulated only in starved cells. In REC, captopril upregulated the pro-survival proteins mortalin-2, uPA, and uPAR while downregulating the anti-growth sprouty-4 and tPA. In CEC, captopril also upregulated tPA and its inhibitor PAI-1. Amiloride (uPA inhibitor) blocked the captopril-induced increase in EC survival, secondary sprouting, and invasion in Matrigel. The pro-survival effects of captopril involve the reprogramming of genes involved in cell survival and immortalization.", 
    "809": "There are established differences in cardiovascular disease in different racial groups. Worldwide, the literature regarding the clinical epidemiology of atrial fibrillation in non-white populations is scarce.", 
    "810": "To document the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the multiracial population of Malaysia, and to describe the clinical features and management of these patients.", 
    "811": "Busy city centre general hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, over a 1-month period.", 
    "812": "One-thousand four hundred and thirty-five acute medical admissions, of whom 40 patients (2.8%) had AF.", 
    "813": "Of 1435 acute medical admissions to Kuala Lumpur General Hospital over the 4-week study period, 40 had AF (21 male, 19 female; mean age 65 years). Of these, 18 were Malay, 16 Chinese and six Indian. Nineteen patients had previously known AF (seven with paroxysmal AF) and 21 were newly diagnosed cases. The principal associated medical conditions were ischaemic heart disease (42.5%), hypertension (40%) and heart failure (40%). Dyspnoea was the commonest presentation, whilst stroke was the cause of presentation in only two patients. Investigations were under-utilised, with chest X-ray and echocardiography in only 62.5% of patients and thyroid function checked in 15%. Only 16% of those with previously diagnosed AF were on warfarin, with a further three on aspirin. Anticoagulant therapy was started in 13.5% of patients previously not on warfarin, and aspirin in 8%. Records of contraindications to warfarin were unreliable, being identified in only 25%. For those with known AF, 58% were on digoxin. For new onset AF, digoxin was again the most common rate-limiting treatment, initiated in 38%, whilst five patients with new onset AF were commenced on amiodarone. DC cardioversion was not used in any of the patients with new onset AF.", 
    "814": "Amongst acute medical admissions to a single centre in Malaysia the prevalence of AF was 2.8%. Consistent with previous similar surveys in mainly western (caucasian) populations, standard investigations in this Malaysian cohort were also inadequate and there was underuse of anticoagulation, medication for ventricular rate control and cardioversion to sinus rhythm.", 
    "815": "The objective of the study was to assess potential pharmacokinetic interactions between delapril, an angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitor, and manidipine, a calcium channel antagonist, prior to the development of a fixed combination drug product.", 
    "816": "Eighteen healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 10 mg manidipine dihydrochloride (CAS 89226-75-5), or 30 mg delapril hydrochloride (CAS 83435-67-0), or both simultaneously, according to a fully balanced three-way cross-over design. The three treatments were separated by a one-week washout period. Blood samples were collected during 24 h for plasma determination of manidipine and metabolite M-XIII and/or of delapril and metabolites M1, M2 and M3, using specific LCMS/MS methods.", 
    "817": "The bioavailability of manidipine and M-XIII was slightly decreased by concomitant administration of delapril (manidipine: Cmax-19% and AUC infinity-11% M-XIII: Cmax-17% and AUCt-18%). The bioavailability of delapril was not influenced by co-administration with manidipine (Cmax-7% and AUC infinity +4%). The effect on delapril pharmacologically active metabolites M1 and M3 was negligible. The inactive metabolite M2 underwent a 13% reduction of Cmax and AUC infinity. The 90% confidence intervals were confined within limits of acceptance (70-143% for Cmax and 80-125% for AUC). Mean residence times and apparent elimination half-lives were unaltered. Blood pressure and heart rate versus time profiles were similar during the three treatments.", 
    "818": "Simultaneous oral administration of 10 mg manidipine and 30 mg delapril does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of either drug or that of their principal metabolites.", 
    "819": "Although interventional studies have established the prognostic importance of the control of risk factors in patients with cardiovascular disease, reviews invariably show that the implementation of secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease during hospitalization for acute manifestations or interventions is unsatisfactory. The aim of this study was to observe secondary prevention practice in a cardiovascular department, as part of a quality assurance program.", 
    "820": "Two hundred and twenty patients discharged from the intensive coronary care unit, cardiac surgery unit and vascular surgery unit were prospectively included. Data were extracted from medical records and discharge documents. One hundred and eleven patients with at least one modifiable risk factor which was previously not corrected, were interviewed at discharge and were reassessed 3 months later.", 
    "821": "Written prescriptions about smoking cessation and weight reduction were given to 7 and 3% of smokers and overweight patients respectively. In 17% of patients no lipid measurement was reported, and in 49% of patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 129 mg/dl statins were not prescribed. In patients with a history of infarction, aspirin and beta-blockers were prescribed in 90 and 64% respectively. In diabetics, statins were prescribed to 48% and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to 31%. Less than 40% of patients were able to refer appropriate levels for their blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol, and 30% fully comprehended the importance of smoking cessation. At the 3-month follow-up visit, 37% of patients had LDL cholesterol levels > 129 mg/dl--in half of these patients despite statins. In 61% of diabetics glycemic control was poor, and one third of smokers had not stopped smoking.", 
    "822": "These observations by the nurses have shown pitfalls in the implementation of guidelines, due to incomplete risk assessment, insufficient drug treatment and ineffective patient education. These data are the starting point for upcoming actions of quality improvement in the cardiovascular department of our hospital.", 
    "823": "There is an increasing interest in monitoring cardiovascular risk factor levels and their treatment. Two studies were run in patients discharged from Divisions of Internal Medicine.", 
    "824": "Two studies, respectively conducted in 1996 and 1999, have collected data on the diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factor levels and treatment in 6450 and 8133 patients (age > or = 35 years) discharged during 1 week from 235 and 345 Italian Divisions of Internal Medicine.", 
    "825": "The second survey revealed: a relative increase in heart failure and cerebrovascular disease diagnoses; lower serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure mean levels, and a decreased incidence of the habit of smoking among males. The proportion of treated hypertensives (blood pressure > or = 140/90 mmHg, or the use of antihypertensive drugs) increased slightly (65 to 68% among men and 69 to 71% among women). A reduction in the use of ACE-inhibitors was observed, balanced by an increase in the use of angiotensin II antagonists. The proportion of treated dyslipidemic patients (total cholesterol levels > or = 250 mg/dl, or HDL cholesterol levels < 35 mg/dl or triglyceride levels > or = 200 mg/dl or the use of hypolipidemic drugs) significantly increased from 10 to 25% among males and from 12 to 25% among females, due to a substantial increase in the use of statins.", 
    "826": "During a 3-year period increasing attention for cardiovascular risk factors and their treatment among patients discharged from Divisions of Internal Medicine has been documented. In particular, there has been a large increase in the use of statins, although large segments of patients may need further attention and drug treatment."
