    "0": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) generation in the mesenteric arteries was studied in four groups of rats: deoxycorticosterone (DOCA)/salt treated, glucocorticoid treated, nephrectomized and control rats. Basal plasma renin activity (PRA) was undetectable in the nephrectomized group and suppressed in the DOCA/salt treated rats, but was increased in the rats treated with glucocorticoid. The Basal plasma ANG II concentration changed comparably with PRA in all four groups of rats. In the control rats, ANG II was released from the mesenteric arteries at a rate of 43.0 +/- 12.0 pg/h, and it was not decreased by nephrectomy. In DOCA/salt rats and glucocorticoid rats, ANG II release significantly decreased to 12.8 +/- 7.1 and 6.9 +/- 1.5 pg/h, respectively. Captopril treatment significantly reduced ANG II release from the mesenteric arteries in both controls and nephrectomized rats, but did not influence ANG II output in DOCA/salt rats or in glucocorticoid treated rats. In nephrectomized rats, captopril lowered blood pressure in association with a significant reduction in the mesenteric ANG II formation. These results indicate that the renal and vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be independently regulated, and in nephrectomized animals the vascular RAS contributes in part to the maintenance of blood pressure. The present results also suggest that volume expansion per se and/or pharmacological intervention by DOCA and glucocorticoid could modulate vascular ANG II generation.",

    "2": "This work analyzed the relationship between A I concentration in aorta tissue and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) at different ages. The SBP of SHRSP increased progressively with the age until the age of 20 weeks, when the SBP of SHRSP no longer elevated but sustained at a relatively high and stable level. The A I concentration in aorta of SHRSP was much higher than that of Wistar Kyoto rats at all of the three different ages. Perfusion of captopril into the lateral cerebroventricle of SHRSP for four weeks evoked a considerable decrease of A I concentration in brain as well as a significant reduction of SBP accompanied by a decrement of A I concentration in aorta and concentration of norepinephrine and epinephrine in aorta tissue and plasma. The results further confirm the close relationship between the changed activity of renin-angiotensin system localized in blood vessels during hypertension and the pathogenesis of hypertension, and indicate the possible regulative control of A I generated from central nervous system over the production of A I from blood vessels by means of facilitating the activity of peripheral sympathetic nerve system.", 
    "3": "Hypertensive patients prescribed captopril while attending a hospital hypertension clinic were studied, to identify the benefits of the drug, its adverse effects and factors predisposing to them. One hundred and eighty two patients were followed for a mean of 18 months; 24 received captopril alone, and 158 combinations of captopril and other antihypertensive drugs, especially loop diuretics (91/158), or thiazide diuretics (57/158), or other vasodilators (57/158). The mean final dose of captopril was 67 mg/day. Blood pressure (BP) was effectively controlled in 73% of patients (mean fall in systolic BP 29 mmHg, CI 24 to 34, P less than or equal to 0.001; mean fall in diastolic BP 18 mmHg, CI 16 to 20, P less than or equal to 0.001). Blood urea and creatinine rose slightly in all patients (urea by 0.9 mmol/l [13%], CI 0.5-1.3, P less than or equal to 0.001 and creatinine by 9 mumols/l [8%], CI 4-13, P less than or equal to 0.001). Twenty six patients were withdrawn from captopril therapy: 6 because of poor control of their blood pressure, two because it was no longer necessary and 12 (7.7%) because of extrarenal adverse effects--10 for rashes, one each for gastric upset and impotence. Captopril was withdrawn in a further 6 patients, because of deteriorating renal function. Factors discriminating those at risk of renal dysfunction were high doses of captopril, concomitant high dose diuretic therapy and undiagnosed renovascular disease.", 
    "4": "A study was undertaken on the role of brainstem renin-angiotensin system in maintenance of hypertension in chronic renovascular hypertensive rats. Hypertension was induced by unilateral renal artery clamping, while the contralateral kidney was left intact (2 KIC). Blood pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA) and brainstem angiotensin (ang-I) levels were measured after 24 days, in hypertensive and sham-operated animals. In separate subgroups of these animals, the effect of intracerebroventricular administration of captopril on the parameters listed was studied. The results showed high ang-I levels in 2 KIC rats as compared to controls (P less than 0.05). Captopril administration (500 micrograms/50 microliters icv) caused a fall in BP and increase in brainstem ang-I levels (P less than 0.01). In control animals, however, captopril produced a rise in BP without any significant change in brainstem ang-I levels. Peripheral plasma renin activity was normal, despite significant sodium retention in 2 KIC rats. The results are suggestive of activation of brainstem renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in chronic 2 KIC hypertension.", 
    "5": "We report the results of a randomized, double-blind, parallel group multicentre study in 120 patients with moderate to severe hypertension, comparing two different types of antihypertensive treatment: a) the standard 'triple therapy' with hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol and hydralazine, and b) the combination of an ACE inhibitor, enalapril with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and methyldopa. The two regimens caused similar degrees of blood pressure reductions. The only significant difference between the two groups was heart rate due to the bradycardiac effect of propranolol in the group treated with the standard 'triple therapy'. Only 3.4% of patients receiving the regimen of enalapril, HCTZ and methyldopa were withdrawn from the study for adverse reactions, against 10% of patients on HCTZ, propranolol and hydralazine. Four cases of hypokalaemia in the enalapril group and 19 in the propranolol group were reported: so enalapril seemed to ameliorate the hypokalaemic effect of HCTZ. The overall analysis of the study results shows that the treatment based on enalapril, HCTZ and methyldopa is as efficient and better tolerated than the established regimen of HCTZ, propranolol and hydralazine.", 
    "6": "It was established that monotherapy with captopril was effective in 72% of patients with hypertensive disease in the elderly. Reduction of the arterial pressure is accompanied by an improvement of the indices of hemodynamics and myocardial contractility as well as relaxation of the left ventricle. Captopril proved more effective in patients with a high concentration of blood angiotensin. Acute load by a single intake of 25 mg of captopril may with high probability predict the efficacy of treatment courses, namely, in patients with a good clinical efficacy reduction of the preparation. Captopril is recommended for the treatment of hypertensive disease in the elderly.", 
    "7": "Although the etiology of Alzheimer's disease includes a wide range of dysfunction, the most essential dysfunction is probably in the mesolimbic acetylcholine (ACh) system. Three novel approaches to modulating ACh function were considered, somatostatin, serotonin (5-HT) and modulation of cortical ACh tone through angiotension II. Concerning somatostatin there is no correlation between the decrease in somatostatin binding sites in brain and choline-acetyl-transferase activity suggesting that modulating somatostatin is not a promising therapeutic approach to Alzheimer's disease. With 5-HT, evidence suggests that 5-HT receptors (in particular 5HT1A) are located on cholinergic projections and behavioral evidence suggests 5-HT modulation of memory function. This area could therefore develop rapidly, particularly in view of the recent discovery of numerous subtypes of 5-HT receptor. Concerning the third approach, recent evidence has shown that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can facilitate ACh release and also possess cognition enhancing activity. The possibility was also evoked that drugs such as piracetam might prevent age-related decreases in ACh receptor density. Concerning trophic factors (e.g. glutamate-induced neuronal sprouting) most approaches have induced amnesia but the search for partial glutamate agonists may have potential. Finally, a neuronal transplant approach was considered but was thought to be very difficult in view of the global brain shrinkage associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "8": "Converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) are widely used in treatment of essential hypertension. Large-scale clinical studies have shown that CEIs are well tolerated and cause fewer side effects than most other antihypertensive agents. The latter observation is fundamental for compliance with long-term treatment. There do exist, however, some side effects which although rare are not negligible. It is necessary though to distinguish between side effects linked to the class of therapeutic agents and those associated with particular structural features. Three types of side effects have been seen: 1) manifestations linked to inhibition of angiotensin II with systemic vasodilation (hypotension, vertigo) and decreased glomerular pressure (functional renal impairment) with preferred onset in renovascular hypertension; 2) potentiation of the bradykinin-prostaglandin system which causes cutaneous eruptions and for reasons still poorly understood a cough which may justify discontinuance of treatment: 3) side effects for which the sulfydryl group is essentially responsible (rash, dysgeusia, neutropenia, proteinuria) and which basically appear to be linked to the use of high doses of captopril. In general terms, and bearing in mind the frequently dose-dependent character of the side effects, it is advisable to prescribe low doses of CEIs, and this therapeutic approach is strengthened by the possibility of concomitant use of a thiazide diuretic allowing improved antihypertensive effects, coupled to better reciprocal tolerance of the drugs. The end result is a better quality of life for the hypertensive subject, and hence improved compliance with long-term treatment.", 
    "9": "STUDY OBJECTIVE - The aim of the study was to examine the effects of antihypertensive drugs on heart and resistance vessels to see whether regression of peripheral vascular hypertrophy accompanies reduction in cardiac mass. DESIGN - Matched groups of spontaneously hypertensive and control rats were treated for 12 weeks with captopril (average dose 65 mg.kg-1.d-1) or hydrochlorothiazide (73 mg.kg-1.d-1) and compared to untreated groups. Perfusion pressure, which has been validated as an index of hypertrophy of resistance vessels, was determined in hind limbs of pithed rats at constant blood flow and maximum vasodilatation. SUBJECTS - Experimental animals were 14 week old male spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats (n = 41) and strictly age matched Wistar Kyoto rats (n = 12). SHR rats were assigned at random to three groups: (a) captopril treated (n = 15), (b) hydrochlorothiazide treated (n = 15), (c) control (n = 11). MEASUREMENTS and RESULTS - Mean perfusion pressure was 29.5(SEM 0.4) mm Hg in untreated Wistar Kyoto rats and 37.4(0.5) mm Hg in untreated SHR rats. In comparison with untreated SHR rats, treatment with captopril lowered blood pressure, perfusion pressure [35.2(0.3) v 37.4(0.5) mm Hg, p less than 0.01)], and left ventricular to body weight ratio [2.28(0.03) v 2.63(0.05) mg.g-1, p less than 0.01)]. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide also lowered blood pressure but had no significant effect on left ventricular weight to body weight ratio [2.54(0.04)]. However, perfusion pressure was reduced to 35.3(0.5) mm Hg, p less than 0.01. CONCLUSIONS - For equal regression of vascular hypertrophy, captopril and hydrochlorothiazide had different effects on regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus left ventricular and vascular structural changes may respond differently to the same drug in the same animal.", 
    "10": "The efficacy and safety of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide was investigated in a multicenter study of 81 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups and, following a placebo period, given enalapril maleate (20 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg), or a combination of the two drugs (32.5 mg). A significant decrease in blood pressure was observed after only 2 weeks in the enalapril and enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide groups. A double dose was required to achieve a satisfactory response in one-third of the patients in both the enalapril (9 of 27) and the enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide groups (8 of 27). Adverse reactions included cough in one patient and mild hyperkalemia in another, both of whom received enalapril. Two patients on the drug combination developed side effects--symptomatic orthostatic hypotension in one and impotence in the second. Enalapril alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide appears to be effective and well tolerated.", 
    "11": "Hypertensive crises require immediate therapy, usually by parenteral drug administration. Sublingual nifedipine has been shown to be highly effective. However, the blood pressure fall following nifedipine is frequently associated with side-effects. The use of sublingual captopril has recently been indicated in hypertensive crisis, assuming that by this route, there would be a faster absorption and thus a more rapid effect on blood pressure than with the oral route. To verify this hypothesis, we have compared the hypotensive effects of sublingual nifedipine and sublingual captopril in 52 patients with hypertensive emergencies: 25-mg captopril and 10-mg nifedipine were administered sublingually to 28 and 24 patients, respectively. Blood pressures and heart rates were continuously measured up to 240 min postdose. A significant (P less than 0.001) hypotensive effect of both sublingual captopril and nifedipine therapy occurred at 5 min and persisted for 240 min. Heart rates increased with nifedipine, but decreased with captopril. We observed no side-effects in the captopril group, but flushing, tachycardia and headache were observed in 6 patients in the nifedipine group. We conclude that sublingual captopril is effective in patients with hypertensive emergencies and that captopril may be an excellent alternative to sublingual nifedipine in the urgent treatment of hypertensive crisis.", 
    "12": "Intrarenal artery infusion of hypertonic saline induces a sustained renal vasoconstriction that is most likely mediated by tubuloglomerular feedback. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of angiotensin II and adenosine to this response in normal-salt and salt-deplete states. Intrarenal infusions of hypertonic saline to sodium-deplete dogs caused a renal vaso-constrictor response that was observed between 5 and 10 min into the infusion. This response was attenuated in dogs on a normal-salt diet and in salt-deplete dogs receiving captopril. Intravenous infusion of subpressor doses of angiotensin II to dogs either on a normal-salt intake or on a salt-deplete diet but receiving captopril, restored the vasoconstrictor response to hypertonic saline. The vasoconstrictor response in the presence of an angiotensin II infusion in each of these two groups of dogs was abolished by an intrarenal artery infusion of the adenosine receptor blocker, theophylline. These experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that intrarenal infusion of hypertonic saline enhances the endogenous production of adenosine and that the ability of adenosine to reduce renal blood flow is dependent on the presence of angiotensin II.", 
    "13": "Alcoholism is a prevalent problem of contemporary society, yet there are virtually no clinically effective drugs for the management of this disorder. A previous study demonstrating the ability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to attenuate voluntary alcohol intake in rats prompted the suggestion that these drugs, currently marketed for the treatment of hypertension, may also be useful in dealing with human alcohol abuse. The present experiments explored in more detail the effect and possible mechanisms of action of this class of drug on alcohol consumption in rats. Experiment one demonstrated that Abutapril, a new ACE inhibitor, significantly reduced alcohol intake and that this effect could not be blocked by either an ANG II or an opiate receptor antagonist suggesting that neither the peripheral renin-angiotensin system (RAS) nor the endogenous enkephalins are involved in the ability of ACE inhibition to attenuate alcohol intake. Experiments two and three showed that ACE inhibition effectively reduced alcohol drinking faster in animals with elevated RAS activity and not at all in animals with suppressed RAS activity indicating that initial levels of RAS activity may determine the speed and ability of ACE inhibition to attenuate alcohol intake. ACE inhibitors may reduce alcohol intake by elevating a nonapeptide fragment or by elevating central ANG II levels. The assessment of this class of drugs to reduce alcohol intake in humans should include a monitoring of the initial level of activity in the renin-angiotensin system since this may be a predictor of the effectiveness of treatment with the ACE inhibitors.", 
    "14": "In the preceding studies we have shown that elements of a kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) are present in trout. The present study examines the cardiovascular effects of intra-arterial kinin injection and the ability of perfused gills or gill homogenates to metabolize bradykinin or the pressor substance generated in trout plasma by glandular kallikrein (T60K). Bradykinin (BK), t-kinin, kallidin, and Met-kallidin produced pressor responses in vivo. BK responses were unaffected by alpha-adrenergic blockade or cyclooxygenase inhibition. Perfused gills extracted approximately 40% of a [3H]BK bolus, however, metabolites were not recovered from the effluent perfusate. Gill homogenates completely metabolized [3H]BK and inactivated the pressor substance T60K. Captopril reduced BK and T60K metabolism by gill homogenates. The present study demonstrates that kinins have pressor effects in trout that are not mediated through adrenergic or prostanoid-derived mechanisms. The results also suggest that trout do not release endothelium-derived relaxing factors in response to kinin injection. The gill is able to metabolize BK and T60K, although, with respect to BK, this process appears to involve intracellular hydrolysis and may be only partially dependent on angiotensin-converting enzyme. Inactivation of BK by gill tissue may be fundamentally different from kinin metabolism by the mammalian lung.", 
    "15": "Evidence for a kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) in fish is incomplete. In the present study, components of the KKS were identified in rainbow trout. Tissues were assayed for kallikrein-like esterolytic activity using three synthetic kallikrein substrates (TAME, VGAN, and PPAN), and the presence of kallikrein substrate (kininogen) in trout plasma was estimated by bradykinin (BK) radioimmunoassay of plasma activated with trypsin (T). Formation of pressor-depressor substances in vivo by porcine glandular kallikrein (GK) and T was measured after intra-arterial injection into unanesthetized trout. Gill and kidney contained kallikrein activity (TAME and VGAN assays); little activity was observed with PPAN. Aprotinin inhibited gill activity (TAME assay). T liberated 42 +/- 3 (SE) ng (n = 10) of immunoreactive BK per milliliter of plasma. Injection of GK in vivo reduced plasma kininogen levels for over 24 h. GK produced pressor responses only in fish pretreated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. This effect was mediated partly through stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. T produced slight pressor responses that were captopril insensitive. These results show that trout possess elements of the KKS system including kallikrein-like enzymatic activity, kininogen, receptor-mediated vascular sensitivity to kallikrein products, and kininolytic activity consistent with ACE (kininase II).", 
    "16": "Captopril (CA) was used to block synthesis of endogenous angiotensin II (ANG II) in periphery and/or brain of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in tests for drinking elicited by eating pelleted chow. Blockade of ANG II-converting enzyme (ACE) in periphery alone (using 0.5 mg/kg CA) increased drinking elicited by eating, whereas simultaneous blockade of ACE in periphery and brain (using subcutaneous 100 mg/kg CA or subcutaneous 0.5 mg/kg plus third ventricular 25 micrograms CA) decreased such drinking. The inhibitory effect of 100 mg/kg CA on water-to-food ratio was prevented by a dipsogenically subthreshold subcutaneous dose (5 micrograms/kg) of ANG II. Blockade of ACE in brain alone (third ventricular 25 micrograms CA) had no effect on food-related drinking. Pharmacological antagonism of ANG II (100 mg/kg CA) together with antagonism of histamine H1 and H2 receptors (using intraperitoneal dexbrompheniramine and cimetidine) were not additive in their inhibitory effects on drinking elicited by eating. Blockade of ACE (100 mg/kg CA) inhibited drinking elicited by subcutaneous histamine, but blockade of histamine receptors failed to inhibit drinking elicited by subcutaneous ANG II. These results support a role for endogenous ANG II under what appear to be physiological conditions for drinking behavior, i.e., when drinking is elicited by eating, and they suggest the working hypothesis of ANG II mediation of a histaminergic mechanism for food-related drinking in the rat.", 
    "17": "This study examined the ability of [des-Asp1]angiotensin II (angiotensin III, ANG III) to interact with the angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors involved in pressor hyperresponsiveness in one-kidney, 3-day renal artery stenosis (RAS) rabbits. In experiment 1, six 3-day RAS rabbits had significantly larger pressor responses to norepinephrine (NE; 800 ng.min-1.kg body wt-1) than did six 3-day controls. The intravenous infusion of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, diminished the pressor response NE in the RAS rabbits. ANG III at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 pmol.min-1.kg-1 iv with captopril resulted in a progressive restoration of pressor hyperresponsiveness to NE in the RAS rabbits, and ANG II at 2.0 pmol.min-1.kg-1 iv produced no further enhancement of the pressor responses to NE. In experiment 2, 12 3-day RAS rabbits had pressor hyperresponsiveness to NE that was alleviated by the infusion of captopril and was restored by the intravenous infusion of ANG III (2 pmol.min-1.kg-1). In six of the these rabbits an additional intravenous infusion of the ANG II antagonist [Sar1,Ile8]ANG II at 300 ng.min-1.kg body wt-1 diminished the pressor hyperresponsiveness to NE; in the other six rabbits the infusion of [Sar1,Ala8] ANG II at 6 micrograms.min-1.kg body wt-1 did not reduce the pressor hyperresponse to NE. In experiment 3, the infusion of ANG III (5 pmol.min-1.kg-1) in six normal rabbits did not alter the pressor responses to NE (400 ng.min-1.kg-1), whereas the infusion of ANG II (5 pmol.min-1.kg-1) resulted in increased pressor responses to NE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "We studied the effects of platelet-activating factor (PAF) on the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. PAF had a novel effect on angiotensin I conversion. The apparent Vmax and Km for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were 2.5 nmol/min per dish and 50 mumol/l, respectively. This activity was enhanced by the addition of PAF to cells. When PAF was added to pulmonary artery endothelial cells, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was enhanced about twofold at 10(-6) mol/l PAF. Maximal stimulation was achieved at 10(-5) mol/l PAF. This stimulatory effect was suppressed by ACE inhibitors such as enalapril and PAF antagonist CV3988. When cells were incubated with 10(-6) mol/l PAF, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II stimulated with PAF was suppressed by CV3988. Enalapril (10(-6) mol/l) completely inhibited the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the presence of PAF. Bradykinin also suppressed ACE activity, but phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine did not affect its activity. These results suggest that PAF may have an important role in regulating vascular tone by modulating angiotensin conversion.", 
    "19": "The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril (Ro 31-2848) on resting and exercise blood pressure (BP) as well as on hormonal and enzyme activities were evaluated following a more than one year long-term treatment. After an initial placebo wash-out (mean sitting BP 151/101), n = 13 hypertensive patients were on cilazapril treatment (1.25, 2.5 or 5 mg/d; in 2 cases with 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide additionally) for 78 (70 to 82) weeks (phase A, mean sitting BP 137/91). Thereafter, they underwent a second placebo wash-out of 4.4 (1 to 10) weeks (phase B, mean sitting BP 137/94) again followed by cilazapril treatment of 9.5 (4 to 14) weeks (phase C, mean sitting BP 137/91) to titrate the minimum antihypertensive dose. At the end of each phase, blood pressure was measured at rest and during isotonic (bicycle) and isometric (handgrip) exercise, and hormones and enzymes were evaluated 4 h post-dose.", 
    "20": "We measured changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) and used angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade with captopril to evaluate the role of the renin-angiotensin system during hemorrhage and after opioid receptor blockade in conscious rabbits. The increase in PRA after nonhypotensive hemorrhage was not statistically significant. PRA increased sixfold after a hypotensive hemorrhage to a mean arterial pressure less than 40 mmHg. This increase was statistically significant. Captopril altered the hemodynamic response to hemorrhage. The normal increase in vascular resistance early in hemorrhage was reduced by captopril pretreatment. After a critical blood loss, arterial pressure and heart rate decreased in both groups. The blood loss required to decrease mean arterial pressure to less than 40 mmHg was approximately 25% less in animals pretreated with captopril. The characteristic decrease in vascular resistance coincident with the onset of hypotension was still present after captopril pretreatment. Injection of naloxone or saline during acute hemorrhagic hypotension did not affect PRA. However, recovery of blood pressure after naloxone or saline was attenuated by converting-enzyme blockade. This attenuation was due primarily to a reduction in spontaneous recovery (i.e., recovery after the control saline injection) and not to a reduction in the response to naloxone. We tested whether this effect of captopril might be due to an interaction of ANG II and catecholamines. The plasma norepinephrine (NE) response to naloxone was statistically similar with and without captopril. In contrast, the response to exogenous NE after hypotensive hemorrhage was significantly reduced by captopril pretreatment. Captopril apparently did not alter baroreflex sensitivity but did reset the baroreflex to lower pressure levels during naloxone's pressor response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Hypertension and cardiomyopathy are prominent findings in humans and rats harboring pheochromocytomas, tumors that can secrete enormous quantities of catecholamines. We have previously found that alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists may ameliorate the hypertension and cardiomyopathy found in New England Deaconess Hospital rats implanted with pheochromocytoma. The present studies were designed to determine the possible action of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on these changes in rats harboring pheochromocytomas. Rats were implanted with transplantable pheochromocytomas and treated with captopril dissolved in the drinking water (1 mg/ml) for 4-6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was monitored by using the tail-cuff technique. In the rats with pheochromocytoma, blood pressure progressively increased to 184 +/- 3 mm Hg after the tumor was implanted. However, in rats with pheochromocytoma treated with captopril in the drinking water before the development of hypertension, blood pressure did not increase (137 +/- 3 mm Hg). In rats with pheochromocytoma with established hypertension, captopril normalized the systolic blood pressure. Plasma norepinephrine was markedly elevated to a similar extent in both groups compared with unimplanted control rats. Plasma renin activities were slightly lower in rats with pheochromocytoma compared with unimplanted control rats. Treatment with captopril of rats with pheochromocytoma did not modify contraction of isolated rings of thoracic aorta exposed in vitro to either phenylephrine or angiotensin II. Treatment with captopril markedly attenuated the cardiomyopathy induced by pheochromocytoma. These results demonstrate that captopril prevents the development of hypertension despite markedly elevated concentrations of catecholamines. In addition, captopril attenuates catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in pheochromocytoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "To investigate whether sodium restriction might replace thiazides in promoting blood pressure (BP) reduction by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the long-term hemodynamic effect of lisinopril plus sodium restriction versus lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide was compared at rest and during dynamic exercise in 2 groups of essential hypertensive patients. Mean pretreatment intraarterial BP at rest sitting was 177/107 mm Hg. The patients were randomly allocated to lisinopril combined with either low salt diet (low salt group, n = 13) or hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic group, n = 12). After 1 year of treatment the mean dose of lisinopril was 25 mg in both groups. In the low salt group sodium excretion was reduced from 188 to 129 mmol/24 hours (p less than 0.01). In the diuretic group sodium excretion was unchanged with a mean dose of hydrochlorothiazide of 19 mg. BP was reduced (p less than 0.001) in both groups: at rest 16 and 21% and during exercise 10 and 13% in the low salt and the diuretic groups, respectively. Total peripheral resistance was reduced (p less than 0.05) in both groups: at rest 14 and 7% and during exercise 8 and 5% in the low salt and the diuretic groups, respectively. Overall cardiac output was reduced (p less than 0.05) in the diuretic group but remained unchanged in the low salt group. Thus, lisinopril--either in combination with a diuretic or sodium restriction--induces marked reduction in BP due to decreases in peripheral vascular resistance both at rest and during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "To examine the manner in which changes in diastolic performance can contribute to the effect of vasodilation in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, we examined the effect of acute inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with intravenous enalaprilat on early LV diastolic filling. We studied 43 patients with congestive heart failure and depressed LV systolic function (mean ejection fraction +/- SD, 0.24 +/- 0.06), performing radionuclide ventriculography before and after administration of 1.25 mg intravenous enalaprilat. We measured the effect of enalaprilat on the maximum rate of early LV diastolic filling normalized in four different ways and related these changes to both LV and right ventricular (RV) volumes. Enalaprilat induced a small but statistically significant reduction in LV end-systolic volume and increase in LV ejection fraction. For the entire patient group, there was no significant change in LV peak filling rate after enalaprilat administration. For individual patients, however, the effect of enalaprilat on peak filling rate was related to resting RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. In patients with enlarged RV end-diastolic volumes (greater than or equal to 120 ml/m2), mean peak filling rate increased from 1.38 +/- 0.6 to 1.71 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic volumes (EDV)/sec and from 244 +/- 131 to 297 +/- 162 ml/sec/m2 after enalaprilat administration, whereas no change in mean peak filling rate was observed in patients with nondilated RVs. These observations were present regardless of the method of normalizing peak filling rate. Thus, the response of LV peak filling rate to enalaprilat is influenced by the presence of RV dilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "An experimental model of in situ isolated carotid arteries has been used to evaluate the static mechanical properties of the arterial wall in 12-week-old Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The effects of endothelium removal and of local incubation with the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (ICI Pharma 209000) on the carotid compliance (CC) were compared with the effects of total abolition of the vascular smooth muscle tone by potassium cyanide. CC measured for pressures ranging from 50 to 175 mm Hg had maximal values (0.22 +/- 0.07 microliter/mm Hg and 0.13 +/- 0.03 microliter/mm Hg, respectively, for WKY and SHR, p less than 0.001) for pressure values close to the operating pressures in both groups. Maximal values of CC were increased by 35% and 45% in WKY and SHR, respectively, after potassium cyanide poisoning (p less than 0.01). The endothelium removal induced a significant increase in CC compared with their control values (+37%, p less than 0.01, and +25%, p less than 0.01, respectively, in WKY and SHR). CC measured after endothelium removal did not significantly differ from its values measured after potassium cyanide poisoning in normotensive animals. In contrast, in hypertensive animals, CC was significantly lower after endothelium, removal than after potassium cyanide poisoning (p less than 0.01). In the presence of intact endothelium, local incubation with converting enzyme inhibitor increased CC by 23% (p less than 0.05) in WKY rats and by 14% (p less than 0.01) in SHR. In contrast, after endothelium removal, converting enzyme inhibitors did not significantly increase further CC in either strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Heart myosin isoforms and arterial blood pressure changes were studied in 30 SHR rats following a long-term treatment with captopril. 30 Wistar rats were included in the same trial as control. Twelve week old SHR rats with an already established hypertension and ventricular hypertrophy were orally administered with between 25 and 100 mg/Kg/die of captopril. After a ten-week treatment, animals were sacrificed and heart myosin isoforms (V1, V2, V3) analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Our results showed that captopril can: a) reduce blood pressure; b) reduce the cardiac hypertrophy; c) reverse the isomyosin enzymes (V1 V3) previously altered by the hypertrophy condition (V3 V1) to normal value. Furthermore we have detected an increase of V myosin isoform in SHR rats (35%) and to a lower extent in treated Wistar rats (17%). Since SHR and Wistar rats usually do not express V isoform, our results suggest that captopril may be responsible for this phenomenon by acting directly on myocardial cells.", 
    "26": "Fifteen patients with essential hypertension underwent treatment with captopril (7 patients) and ramipril (8 patients). The drugs belong to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Pretreatment immunological examination and that after a 10-15-week course of the above therapy involved measurements of IgG, IgA, IgE and beta 2-microglobulin. The analysis of the trend in the immunological indices demonstrated that captopril, distinct from ramipril by the presence of a sulfhydryl group, caused a decrease in immunological parameters suggesting a potential role of culfhydryl groups in mediating ACE inhibitor action on the immune system. The immunological properties of captopril may appear useful in various systemic diseases.", 
    "27": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) secondary to a pressure overload commonly leads to perfusion abnormalities that may limit oxygen delivery to the myocardium and, therefore, result in cardiocyte intracellular damage. We initiated this study to test the hypothesis that the increased vulnerability of the hypertrophied left ventricle to acute hypoxia is minimized when LVH regresses and maximal coronary flow returns to normal. Six-month-old spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were divided into control or one of two antihypertensive treatment groups. A 3-month treatment consisted of captopril (75-100 mg/kg) or hydralazine (80-160 mg/L) with hydrochlorothiazide (500 mg/L) added to each therapy. At the conclusion of the treatment period, the rats were administered a 7% O2-93% N2 gas mixture for 20 minutes to induce acute hypoxic stress during which time hemodynamics, blood gases, and pH were monitored. The heart was then rapidly fixed by vascular perfusion and prepared for electron microscopy. Captopril and hydralazine were equally effective in lowering arterial pressure in both strains, but only captopril was efficacious in reducing heart mass. Hypoxia-induced changes in hemodynamics, blood gases, and pH were similar in all of the groups; PO2 was decreased by about 70%. The electron micrographs revealed that the hypertrophied left ventricle consistently showed morphologic evidence of hypoxic damage (as indicated by T-tubular swelling, intracellular edema, and mitochondrial alterations); in contrast hypoxia had little effect on the non-hypertrophied ventricle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems are frequently activated in patients with congestive heart failure, and they make important contributions to characteristic abnormalities in vasoconstriction. In 177 patients with congestive heart failure, however, there was a widespread distribution of levels of plasma renin activity and plasma norepinephrine, indicating that activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system was not uniform. Furthermore, there were only weak correlations between plasma renin activity and plasma norepinephrine and hemodynamic measurements, age, and renal function, indicating that activation of these systems is complex and determined by many other factors. The converting enzyme inhibitors have beneficial effects on the hemodynamic abnormalities of patients with heart failure, with reductions in arterial tone and preload as well as increases in cardiac output. Their long-term effects on markers of the renin-angiotensin system, however, and their interactions with the sympathetic nervous system and atrial natriuretic factor are less well defined.", 
    "29": "Captopril stimulates glomerular prostaglandin (PG) synthesis and increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in Na-repleted rats, whereas, in Na-depleted rats, it fails to stimulate PG synthesis and decreases GFR. In the present work the influence of chronic and acute NaCl loading on PG synthesis and renal function was studied in Na-depleted rats receiving captopril (LNC rats). Glomerular PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were not increased in LNC rats and were significantly lower than in Na-depleted rats (LN). Na repletion, while continuing captopril, increased PG synthesis above control levels. Addition of captopril in vitro to the incubation medium stimulated PGE2 synthesis in glomeruli of control rats, whereas it depressed it in LN rats. Acute loading with NaCl in LNC rats increased inulin and PAH clearances to values significantly greater than in control rats and similar to those of normal rats receiving captopril. Comparable volume loading with isotonic mannitol or 3% albumin increased inulin and PAH clearances only to control values. The specific effect of NaCl in acute loading was prevented by cyclooxygenase inhibition and was not mediated by increased systemic blood pressure. The results provide evidence that the effects of captopril on glomerular PG synthesis and renal function depend on the state of Na balance.", 
    "30": "The aim of the study was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of a new beta blocker with high beta 1 selectivity, bisoprolol, with captopril in 28 elderly patients, aged over 65 years, with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (WHO classes I and II). After a placebo run-in period of 4 weeks, the patients were randomly allocated to receive bisoprolol (5 mg od) or captopril (25 mg bid) (double-dummy technique) for 6 weeks, according to a crossover double-blind design, with a 4-week washout period between the two active treatments. The doses were doubled after 2 weeks if the supine blood pressure was greater than 160/95 mmHg. In basal conditions and after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of each treatment, the blood pressure and heart rate were assessed both in the supine and erect positions. At the same time, the side effects and quality of life were investigated by a checklist and a self-assessment questionnaire. Standard laboratory tests and a resting ECG tracing were performed before and after each active treatment. The data from 24 patients (4 dropouts) showed a significant antihypertensive effect of both treatments (p less than 0.01) with a reduction of diastolic blood pressure to values less than or equal to 95 mmHg in 75% (18/24) of the patients treated with bisoprolol and in 83.3% (20/24) of those treated with captopril, without significant differences between the two drugs. Bisoprolol also produces a marked but symptom-free reduction of heart rate compared with captopril (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "We studied whether or not neonatal streptozotocin (STZ) treatment would alter mean arterial pressure (MAP) and blood pressure regulating factors in conscious and unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Neonatal STZ administration to SHR resulted in type 2 diabetes mellitus with reduced MAP and heart rate. Plasma glucose was markedly increased in these diabetic animals and was inversely correlated with MAP. In the diabetic SHR, the hypotensive responses to captopril (SQ) or enalapril, administered intravenously, were diminished, regardless of preceding administrations of vasopressin V1-antagonist (AVPA) or hexamethonium (C6), when compared to findings in control rats. In contrast, the C6-induced hypotension was similar in rats with diabetes and control animals. AVPA led to no decrease in MAP in either group. Hypotensive responses to SQ following AVPA and C6 inversely correlated with the plasma levels of glucose in the diabetic group. The combined blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), sympathetic nervous system and vasoconstrictive action of vasopressin (AVP) abolished the differences in MAP between the groups. Pressor and bradycardic responses to intravenous noradrenaline, angiotensin II and AVP were practically identical in the diabetic and control SHR. Urinary aldosterone excretion rate was not altered by neonatal STZ treatment. In conclusion, a decrease in MAP in SHR with neonatal STZ treatment may be attributed to the suppressed pressor activity of RAS.", 
    "32": "Studies in two-kidney--one clip hypertensive rats have demonstrated that long-term treatment with enalapril induced regression of cardiac hypertrophy, but the cardiac contractile response to beta-adrenergic stimulation remained depressed. In the present study, we evaluate the contractile response to beta-adrenergic stimulation of isolated papillary muscle in normal rats with isoproterenol (10(-11) M to 10(-4) M) in the presence of enalaprilic acid (10(-6) M or 10(-4) M) or enalaprilic acid (10(-4) M) and angiotensin II (10(-6) M). Myocardial contractility was characterized by maximal developed tension and maximal rate of rise of tension (+T), and the relaxant effect of isoproterenol by the ratio of (+T), and the maximal velocity of relaxation (-T)(+T/-T ratio). The rest tension (g/mm2) and the cross-sectional area (mm2) were similar in all the muscles studied. Enalaprilic acid (either 10(-6) M or 10(-4) M) in the bath did not induce any change in contractile and relaxation parameters. The increment in +T and -T (expressed as percentage) in response to cumulative doses of isoproterenol (10(-11) M to 10(-4) M) was significantly depressed in the presence of enalaprilic acid (10(-4) M) when compared with control hearts in which only vehicle was added before isoproterenol (p less than 0.05). The addition of angiotensin II after enalaprilic acid (10(-4) M) did not normalize the response in +T and -T. Enalaprilic acid diminishes the contractile response of the papillary muscle to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The inhibition of the local angiotensin II does not seem to be involved in this result.", 
    "33": "Most research in the field of chronic heart failure during the last 20 years has been directed toward defining and understanding the abnormalities of systolic function seen in this disorder, but systolic performance is not a determinant of effort tolerance. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest a strong relation between exercise capacity and abnormalities of diastolic function in chronic heart failure. Of all the commonly measured hemodynamic variables, effort tolerance (whether limited by dyspnea or fatigue) varies more closely with the level of left ventricular filling pressure than the left ventricular ejection fraction. Consequently, drugs that lower ventricular filling pressures are more likely to enhance exercise capacity than drugs that primarily increase cardiac output and left ventricular ejection phase indexes. Vasodilator drugs do not reduce left ventricular filling pressure, however, by simply redistributing central blood volume to the peripheral capacitance circuits because these agents do not predictably decrease left ventricular volumes. Instead, clinically effective drugs seem to reduce left ventricular filling pressure primarily by producing a favorable shift in the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation. Conversely, agents that adversely affect the diastolic pressure-volume relation frequently cause clinical deterioration. These findings suggest that abnormalities of diastolic rather than systolic performance may be the most important determinants of the clinical status and exercise intolerance of patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "34": "The new ACE inhibitor trandolapril was administered to normal volunteers at daily doses of 0.5, 2, and 8 mg for 10 days. Twenty-one volunteers, aged 21-30 years, were included in the study. To randomly selected groups of seven subjects, each dose was administered in a single-blind fashion. None of the doses induced a consistent fall in blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (ACE) was measured in vitro using three different synthetic substrates (i.e., Hip-Gly-Gly, Z-Phe-His-Leu, or angiotensin I). Although the degree of ACE inhibition assessed with the three methods varied widely, all methods clearly indicated dose-dependent ACE inhibition. These in vitro results were confirmed by measuring ACE inhibition in vivo using the ratio of plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) to blood angiotensin I (ANG I). The dose-dependent ACE inhibition was paralleled by a dose-dependent rise in active renin and blood angiotensin I levels, most evident on day 10. In contrast, plasma ANG II levels on day 10 were not different whether the volunteers received 0.5 or 8 mg trandolapril. Thus, whereas increasing doses of this new ACE inhibitor progressively enhanced the blockade of ACE activity, this was not reflected by additional reductions of plasma ANG II levels. The progressive enhancement of ACE inhibition seemed to be offset by the accentuation of the compensatory rise in renin and ANG I, which was still partially converted to ANG II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "This study was performed to examine whether cilazapril, a novel nonsulfhydril angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, may improve regional myocardial perfusion at exercise in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). In a single-blind, nonrandomized trial, 5 mg cilazapril or placebo was administered to eight patients with documented CHD and stable exertional angina. Multistage bicycle exercise tests were performed and each patient served as his own control. At peak exercise, as well as at rest, [99mTc]hexakis-2-methoxy-2-isobutylisonitrile myocardial images were obtained. Percent myocardial activity differences (%AD) between exercise and resting images were compared (cilazapril versus placebo). Heart rate and blood pressure were not significantly different between trials. However, after cilazapril administration, %AD was higher than after placebo, with relative differences between trials of greater than 30%, along with alleviation of clinical symptoms in seven of eight patients. These data suggest that in patients with stable-effort angina, ACE inhibition with cilazapril is able to redistribute myocardial blood flow and to improve regional oxygen supply to the ischemic myocardium.", 
    "36": "The effect of enalapril on glomerular hemodynamics and permselectivity and on subsequent sclerosis was studied in male MWF/Ztm rats which spontaneously develop proteinuria and glomerular structural damage. Untreated group 1 and enalapril-treated group 2 (50 mg/liter, in the drinking water) underwent micropuncture studies after 2 mo of observation. After the same period of treatment, group 3 (untreated) and group 4 (enalapril treated) were used for determination of whole-kidney function and neutral dextran clearances. Group 5 (untreated) and group 6 (enalapril treated) were followed for an additional 4 mo and used for kidney function and morphological studies. Enalapril significantly lowered systolic blood pressure, which was elevated in untreated groups, and significantly reduced proteinuria (295 +/- 64 vs. 128 +/- 24 mg/24 h by the end of the study). Despite the reduced renal perfusion pressure, whole-kidney glomerular filtration rate was higher in enalapril-treated than in untreated rats (0.96 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.10 ml/min, P less than 0.05) as was the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (54 +/- 7.1 vs. 46 +/- 4.0 nl/min, P less than 0.05). The single glomerular afferent plasma flow was comparable in both groups. Enalapril reduced mean glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure from the normal value of 51 +/- 1 mmHg (untreated rats) to a value lower than normal (44 +/- 1 mmHg, P less than 0.001). These hemodynamic changes were associated with a significant reduction in afferent (approximately 23%) and efferent (approximately 26%) arteriolar resistance. The mean ultrafiltration coefficient was two times higher in the enalapril (0.126 +/- 0.027 nl/s per mmHg) than in the untreated group (0.061 +/- 0.023 nl/s per mmHg). The clearance of dextran macromolecules relative to that of inulin was significantly reduced for all molecular sizes studied (26-64 A) in enalapril-treated vs. untreated rats. Theoretical analysis of dextran fractional clearances using a heteroporous model of neutral solute transport across the glomerular capillary wall indicated that enalapril affected glomerular membrane size selective properties, reducing uniformly the radius of hypothetical membrane pores. Enalapril treatment also significantly limited (P less than 0.01) the development of glomerular structural lesions (mean percentage of sclerotic glomeruli was 4.2 +/- 3.5% [treated] vs. 28 +/- 15% [untreated] rats at the end of the study) as well as tubulo-interstitial damage. These results suggest that the protective effect of enalapril on the development of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis in this model is due to its property of ameliorating size selectivity and hydraulic permeability of the glomerular capillaries.",

This holds true regarding improvement of prognosis of CHF by ACE inhibition. While symptomatic improvement of CHF by addition of ACE-inhibition. While symptomatic improvement of CHF by addition of ACE-inhibitors has been demonstrated in numerous studies, improvement of prognosis has not yet been demonstrated entirely sufficiently. Only one trial has been published so far in a severely ill but not very exactly defined population (66). Animal studies and several small or interim published trials, however, show that the positive influence of ACE-inhibitors on CHF pathophysiology and symptomatology might favourable affect the prognosis as well. The SAVE trial and the SOLVD trial - both have randomized several thousand patients - will give answers concerning the influence of Captopril and Enalapril on prognosis of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and on progression of left ventricular dilatation. The VHEFT II trial will compare the effect of ACE-inhibitors with the combination of ISDN and Hydralazine. Results will be available within the first few years of this decade.",

Adverse reactions during converting enzyme inhibitor treatment in the elderly may be slightly more frequent than in younger patients, but whether this is related to the drugs themselves or to the general characteristics of elderly hypertensives has not been established. Likewise, whether or not the hypotensive action of converting enzyme inhibitors is age-related is as yet unknown. Finally, studies on the impact of converting enzyme inhibitors on morbidity, mortality and general well being in elderly patients have not been carried out or published. Thus, while the drugs appear to have usefulness in the older hypertensive, their benefits and precise use in this age group are not as yet definitive.", 
    "40": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were developed to prevent the generation of angiotensin II and thereby to reduce peripheral vasoconstriction. These drugs have already proven their efficacy in the management of essential hypertension as well as of various forms of secondary hypertension. When given alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, they allow to normalize blood pressure of almost all patients. These compounds have favorable effects on hemodynamics and regional blood flow distribution. They do not affect lipid metabolism and have usually no deleterious influence on the quality of life. In view of their efficacy and tolerability profile, ACE inhibitors are likely to become widely used as first choice antihypertensive agents.",

Clarification of the mechanisms involved will not only increase the understanding of the pathomechanisms involved in progression, but also enrich the therapeutic armamentarium available to the nephrologist.", 
    "42": "The main effect of the ACE-inhibitors is a reduction of the peripheral resistance and according to that an increase of blood-flow to the organs. Direct effects on the heart are of minor importance. The exact mechanism of action is not fully understood; the main role plays obviously the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme itself; in addition may be effects on the kallikrein-bradykinin-prostaglandin-system are of importance. The pharmacodynamical effects depend on the plasma-concentration and therefore on the pharmacokinetics. These are different with Captopril and Enalapril: Captopril acts directly whereas Enalapril is a \"prodrug\". With the nowadays used doses Captopril and Enalapril are widely free of side-effects. With the exception of patients with negative sodium-balance (salt-poor diet and/or treatment with diuretics) or patients with renal insufficiency (sometimes increase of creatinine and potassium). In the first group of patients the first dose of ACE-inhibitors should be administered in the evening before going to bed, in the second group creatinine and potassium must be checked 5 to 7 days after an initiation of treatment.", 
    "43": "The effects of captopril on potassium influx and cellular proliferation in a dog kidney epithelial cell line (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, MDCK) were studied. Na+K(+)-ATPase activity and the loop diuretic sensitive Na/K/2Cl- cotransport were measured using 86Rb as tracer substance. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of captopril (1-10 mmol/l). The furosemide sensitive Na/K/2Cl- cotransport was significantly decreased from 1 mmol/l onwards. Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity was lowered only when high amounts (10 mmol/l) of the drug were used. Cell proliferation was measured via [3H]thymidine incorporation. After incubation with 1 mmol/l captopril proliferation was strongly decreased (greater than 50%). Higher amounts (5-10 mmol/l) did not further suppress cell proliferation. The data suggest that natriuresis following ACE inhibition in vivo does not involve a direct effect of captopril on Na+K(+)-ATPase. However, the effect on cell proliferation may be of clinical relevance in respect to a possible mitogenic effect of angiotensin II.", 
    "44": "There is evidence from experiments in animals, biological and molecularbiological investigations, that extra-renal renin-angiotensin systems may have important implications in the pathogenesis of various diseases, in particular in regard to the development of hypertrophy in smooth muscle cells of blood vessels and in the myocardium. Thus, it is getting more likely, that angiotensin II is an endogenous growth factor. We have recently shown, in an animal model of left ventricular hypertrophy (aortic stenosis due to a silver clip on the aorta ascendens), that chronic application of an ACE-inhibitor results in a nearly complete regression of left ventricular hypertrophy even under the conditions of an unaltered afterload. The extent of the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy was not statistically different from animals in which the regression of hypertrophy was achieved by removal of the clip. According to these results, we demonstrated for the first time, that the renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in the maintenance of left ventricular hypertrophy and that after the inhibition of the system, a considerable regression of left ventricular mass can be achieved which is independent from hemodynamic factors.", 
    "45": "It is now established that ACE-inhibitors are effective in the treatment of severe chronic heart failure; in addition to digitalis and diuretics. Furthermore, recent studies suggest, that beneficial effects of ACE-inhibitors can be expected in patients with moderate heart failure: when combined with diuretics. In atrial fibrillation, the combination with digitalis is recommended. Up to now, there is no clear evidence that monotherapy with ACE-inhibitors is superior to first line therapy with diuretics or digitalis. Nevertheless, initial (and limited) experience favors the use of ACE-inhibitors to prevent progressive LV-dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Based on experimental data, several additional mechanisms of action (besides unloading the heart) have been proposed; which may open up new indications for ACE-inhibition, such as antiarrhythmic, antiischemic or antiproliferative effects (including decreased incidence of coronary restenosis following angioplasty). If confirmed by clinical studies, the indications for ACE-inhibitors will expand considerably, putting emphasis on prevention of occurrence and progression of heart failure rather than treatment of very late stages of chronic heart failure. Yet, the Consensus trial demonstrated a significant impact of these agents on mortality in the latter patient population.", 
    "46": "The renin angiotensin system is an important system for the regulation of blood pressure and salt and water homeostasis. As a pathogenetic factor it is involved in the development of several forms of renal hypertension and, furthermore, it participates in the pathogenesis of primary and secondary hypertension. The regulation of the activity of the system is under the control of neuronal and hormonal mechanisms and depends on blood pressure and plasma concentrations of sodium chloride. With the development of converting enzyme inhibitors and their vasodilator, diuretic and sympatholytic actions a new important antihypertensive principle for lowering blood pressure was found. In this context also local renin angiotensin systems which have been described for several tissues have to be discussed as a possible target of action for converting enzyme inhibitors.",

In the case of fresh infarctions, functional myocardium can be protected or salvaged in particular by early thrombolysis, early administration of calcium antagonists or beta blockers (in particular the combination of calcium antagonists with beta blockers). In the area of secondary prevention, beta blockers predominate. In chronic coronary insufficiency, calcium antagonists, nitrates and beta blockers are the first-choice cardioprotective agents.", 
    "48": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin-3 (ET-3) and sarafotoxin S6b (SRFTX) produced a concentration-dependent contraction of the guinea-pig isolated bronchus. In untreated preparations, SRFTX was about 10 times more potent than ET-1 or ET-3 and produced a greater maximal effect. Mechanical removal of the bronchial epithelium (rubbing) or the addition of indomethacin (5 microM) increased the potency of all peptides, ET-3 being enhanced more than ET-1 or SRFTX. Further, the activity of ET-3 was enhanced by a mixture of peptidase inhibitors (thiorphan, captopril, bestatin, 1 microM each). When the three potentiating factors were combined (rubbed bronchi in presence of indomethacin and peptidase inhibitors), the following order of potency was found, ET-3 congruent to SRTFX greater than ET-1. For comparison, the activity of the three peptides was also studied in the rubbed rat isolated aorta in the presence of indomethacin and peptidase inhibitors and the following rank order of potency was found: ET-1 greater than SRFTX greater than ET-3. When the activity of the peptides was compared in these two preparations, ET-1 was 4 times more potent in the aorta than in the bronchus, while SRFTX and ET-3 were 8.7 and 133 times more potent in the bronchus than the aorta, respectively. These findings indicate that, in the guinea-pig bronchus, the contractile activity of these peptides is attenuated by the concomitant production of epithelium-derived relaxant factor(s), prostanoid production via the cyclooxygenase pathway and, possibly, enzymatic inactivation of added peptides. Further, the existence of multiple receptors mediating the contractile response to these peptides is suggested.", 
    "49": "We recently reported that calcium ionophore A23187 causes a several-fold elevation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells in culture and that this elevation is dependent upon extracellular calcium. Now we have observed that monensin, a sodium ionophore, also elevates the ACE activity of these cells. This elevation in ACE was not inhibited by 0.2 mM EGTA or the calcium channel inhibitor nifedipine, and monensin did not alter intracellular calcium as measured by fluorimetric assessment of fura-2/AM-loaded cells. When confluent endothelial cells were incubated with monensin or A23187 in the presence of 10-20 nM ouabain, a specific inhibitor of Na+/K(+)-ATPase, the elevation in ACE produced by both of the ionophores was totally eliminated. Concentrations of ouabain greater than 10 nM also inhibited baseline levels of ACE activity. Ca2+ measurements of fura-2/AM-loaded cells showed that ouabain had no effect on the influx of Ca2+ produced by A23187. The elevation of ACE seemed to require new protein synthesis, since 0.1 micrograms/ml cycloheximide inhibited the elevation produced by monensin and A23187. Other sodium transport inhibitors such as amiloride or bumetanide had no effect on ACE elevation caused by monensin. These results suggest that ACE levels of bovine endothelial cells in culture are under cation regulation and may be modulated by ouabain-sensitive Na+/K(+)-ATPase.",

To evaluate the role of endogenous angiotensin II in the high plasma 18-OHB/aldosterone ratio in sodium-depleted rats, we examined the effect of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14225 on plasma 18-OHB and aldosterone in sodium-depleted (SD) and sodium-repleted (SR) conscious rats. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma angiotensin II were higher in the SD rats than in the SR rats. The ingestion of SQ 14225 caused an increase in PRA and a decrease in plasma angiotensin II, whereas these changes were more prominent in the SD rats than in the SR rats. Plasma 18-OHB and aldosterone levels were higher in the SD rats than in the SR rats. The plasma 18-OHB/aldosterone ratio was also higher in the SD rats than in the SR rats. The ingestion of SQ 14225 caused decreases in plasma 18-OHB and aldosterone levels in both the SR and SD rats, whereas the SQ 14225-induced decreases in plasma 18-OHB and aldosterone levels were more prominent in the SD rats than in the SR rats. Thus, the ingestion of SQ 14225 induced a decrease in the plasma 18-OHB/aldosterone ratio in both the SR and SD rats.

Both of these preparations caused significant reduction in the diastolic blood pressure (BT) measured two and 12 hours after the last dose. Nifedipin caused 5% reduction of the diastolic blood pressure measured 12 hours after the last dose more frequently than did captopril. Where both preparations were concerned, the blood pressure measured two hours after the last intake of medicine was significantly lower than after 12 hours. Neither of the two anti-hypertensive preparations resulted in changes in the clinical-chemical variables measured here. No changes in weight of over 5% were observed. Treatment with nifedipin frequently resulted in headache and flushing during the first days of treatment. Three of the patients did not wish to continue nifedipin treatment and one did not wish to continue captopril treatment after the period of observation. Six patients experienced considerably improved general health during captopril treatment and three during nifedipin as compared with their condition prior to treatment.", 
    "53": "The potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor 351A was radioiodinated (125I-351A) and used to quantitate ACE in the striatum of rats treated with the cholinergic neurotoxin AF64A. Unilateral administration of 4 nmol of AF64A into the striatum, which caused a 42% reduction in striatal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, reduced binding of 125I-351A in the lesioned striatum by 37% relative to the untreated striatum. The AF64A treatment also reduced the dopamine (DA) concentration by 59% in the lesioned striatum, but did not significantly reduce the serotonin (5-HT) concentration. Despite the reductions in ACE and these neurochemical markers, there was no significant correlation between the extent of reduction of the specific neurochemical markers and ACE. These results suggest that the AF64A treatment caused non-specific damage to striatal non-cholinergic neurons as well as destroying cholinergic neurons, and that ACE is contained in non-cholinergic neurons.", 
    "54": "The controlled study was carried out on 15 patients with essential hypertension not sufficiently controlled after one month of monotherapy with an ACE-inhibitor. To the above therapy was therefore associated a low dosage diuretic (indapamide 2.5 mg/day). The observation period was of 12 weeks. The delapril-indapamide combination was found to be very effective in reducing blood pressure values; no significant metabolic adverse effects were observed.", 
    "55": "Albuminuria (UalbV) increases in proportion to dietary protein in rats with passive Heymann nephritis. To determine whether a similar relationship existed in normal animals, 14 normal rats were switched from an 8.5% protein diet (LP) to a 40% protein diet (HP). Initially UalbV and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased in parallel, but GFR ceased to increase after 48 h while UalbV continued to increase, causing a significant increase in fractional renal clearance of albumin (FCalb). In contrast, HP for 4 days caused only a transient increase in GFR in nephrotic rats but effected a threefold sustained increase in UalbV. Pretreatment of nephrotic rats with enalapril blunted but did not entirely prevent the increase in UalbV after switching to HP and did not affect the increase or subsequent decline in GFR. Treatment with enalapril for 10 days reduced UalbV and FCalb in nephrotic rats fed either LP or HP. The similar pattern of changes in urinary albumin excretion in normal and nephrotic rats after dietary protein augmentation suggests that dietary protein may modify UalbV by the same process in both normal and nephrotic animals. The increases in UalbV and GFR resulting from dietary protein augmentation represent parallel but independent processes, since only the proteinuric response is modified by converting enzyme inhibition. Dietary protein restriction and converting enzyme inhibition exert an additive effect to reduce UalbV.", 
    "56": "The therapeutic effect of long-term enalapril administration was studied in 20 patients with severe essential hypertension (EH), resistant to intensive therapy with a combination of 3 or 4 antihypertensive drugs. Addition of enalapril (Renitec MSD from 5 to 40 mg/day) to the previous therapy allowed to maintain blood pressure within limits not exceeding 150/95 mmHg during a 12-month study in more than 80% of previously resistant patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy regressed in all patients and dilatation of the left ventricle seen in 4 patients disappeared during enalapril treatment. Serum sodium creatinine did not change significantly. Serum potassium increased slightly but remained within the normal range. Proteinuria had a tendency to diminish and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in the urine dropped within normal limits. Based on their results, the authors conclude that enalapril is suitable for the long-term treatment of patients with severe EH, resistant to intensive antihypertensive therapy, with minimal side effects, good tolerance and a tendency for amelioration of cardiac and renal function.", 
    "57": "angiotensin converting enzyme converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a peptide that plays an important role in the central regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. However, the distribution of this enzyme in the human brain has not been well described. In this study, angiotensin converting enzyme was mapped in the human basal forebrain and midbrain by using quantitative in vitro autoradiography employing a derivative of a potent converting enzyme inhibitor, 125I-351A, as radioligand. This radioligand binds specifically and with high affinity to angiotensin converting enzyme and also exhibited these properties in binding to slide-mounted sections of human basal ganglia. In the basal ganglia, high levels of binding of 125I-351A are found in the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, both divisions of the globus pallidus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata. High densities of labelling also occur in the ventral pallidum. In the hypothalamus, a moderate level occurs in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and a diffuse, low level of binding is found throughout the periventricular region. The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, one of the circumventricular organs, displays the highest concentration of binding. The choroid plexus contains only moderate density of labelling in contrast to other mammalian species previously studied. Major fibre tracts are devoid of activity except for the posterior limb of the internal capsule, which contains fascicles of intense activity. In the midbrain, a moderate density of binding is detected in the periaqueductal gray. The dorsal, central linear, and, more caudally, the centralis superior medialis raphe nuclei also contain moderate densities of labelling. Angiotensin converting enzyme is heterogeneously distributed in the caudate nucleus and putamen, with distinct patches of high concentration surrounded by a matrix of diffuse, lower levels. In the caudate nucleus, these patches of high binding corresponded to striosomes since they register with acetylcholinesterase-poor zones. The high concentration of angiotensin converting enzyme found in the basal ganglia suggests that the enzyme may be involved in processing neuropeptides that occur in high concentrations in these structures. Possible substrates for converting enzyme include not only angiotensin I but also substance P and enkephalins, which are also concentrated in striosomes.", 
    "58": "In a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-placebo therapeutic trial, the effectiveness and safety of enalapril and slow-release nifedipine were studied in two groups of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo period, 136 patients were allocated at random to either enalapril 20 mg/day in one evening dose (group 1, n = 68) or to nifedipine 40 mg/day in two doses, one a.m. the other p.m. (group II). Each treatment was administered for 12 weeks. Patients in both groups whose diastolic arterial pressure remained above 90 mmHg were given hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day from the 4th week onward. When blood pressure did not return to normal, the dose of hydrochlorothiazide was increased to 50 mg/day in the 8th week. After 4 weeks of treatment, no significant difference in reduction of supine diastolic arterial pressure was observed between the two groups (- 12.1 +/- 9.9 mmHg in groups I vs - 10.3 +/- 9.0 mmHg in group II). At the end of the 12-week treatment the decrease of diastolic blood pressure was more pronounced in patients on enalapril than in those on nifedipine (- 16.3 +/- 8.0 mmHg vs - 13.9 +/- 7.1 mmHg), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). The number of patients with undesirable side-effects was greater in the nifedipine group (33 patients; 48.5 per cent) than in the enalapril group (18 patients; 26.5 per cent). Treatment was discontinued on account of side-effects in 3 patients of the enalapril group and 10 patients of the nifedipine group.", 
    "59": "Platelet aggregation using a single platelet counting technique in whole blood, was determined on 18 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and 17 age-matched controls. Platelet aggregation in the Raynaud's patients was also assessed during a double-blind, crossover trial to investigate the efficacy of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril. There were no differences in platelet aggregation to collagen, arachidonic acid, ADP or PAF, or in plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin (BTG), platelet factor 4 (PF4) or thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) between the Raynaud's group and the normal controls. Similarly, there were no differences in these parameters in the Raynaud's group during treatment with enalapril when compared to placebo. It is concluded that patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon have no evidence of abnormal platelet aggregation or increased platelet activation, and that platelet aggregation is not affected by enalapril.", 
    "60": "There are important pharmacodynamic differences between the various beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors differ mainly in their pharmacokinetic properties. The differing properties of the beta-blocking drugs may contribute to their antihypertensive effect; possibly, the beta1-selective agents are slightly more effective. Comparisons between groups of drugs may not be fully applicable to all members of the group. Overall, however, beta-blocking drugs and ACE inhibitors appear to control the resting blood pressure to a similar degree, whereas on exercise the rise in blood pressure is inhibited to a greater extent by beta1-blockade. ACE inhibitors reverse the hemodynamic changes of hypertension in contrast to beta1-blocking drugs without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Neither group of drugs interferes with cardiovascular reflexes such as the response to posture. The beta-blocking drugs have specific contraindications such as asthma and heart failure. Although some earlier studies suggested otherwise, more recent smaller investigations suggest that overall patient acceptability of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers is similar. In certain instances, particularly in the presence of diuretics, a large first-dose effect with a profound fall in blood pressure may be seen with ACE inhibitors. In contrast to other drugs, there is some evidence that beta-blocking drugs have a cardioprotective effect. ACE inhibitors and beta-blocking drugs have a similar spectrum of activity, with black patients responding less well. Although in dispute, drugs are often useful in the elderly. Both groups possess additional therapeutic indications that may influence the choice to treat hypertension.", 
    "61": "Both beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to cause left ventricular hypertrophy regression in hypertensive patients. So far, no study allowed a true comparison of these drugs in this regard. Therefore, 56 hypertensive patients (38 newly recognized and 18 without any antihypertensive drugs for more than 2 months, mean of 9.5+/-14 months) were randomized to enalapril (En, n = 30) or a beta-blocker, bisoprolol (Bi, n = 26), once daily and underwent before and after 2 and 6 months on treatment (a) office and 24-h ambulatory monitoring of BP, (b) M-mode echo assessment of left ventricular mass (LVM) index and fractional shortening (FS), and (c) Doppler evaluation of left ventricular filling. All recordings were read blindly by two observers. The intraobserver coefficient of variation of LVM was 9%. After 6 months, office BP (146+/-18/90+/-10 vs. 170+/-14/104+/-8 mm Hg) and 24-h BP(120+/-17/77+/-9 vs. 138+/-15/90+/-9 mm Hg) were similarly reduced with both drugs. The LVM index was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) (Bi, 11%; En, 7%) and FS was unchanged. The early to late diastolic left ventricular flow ratio (E/A) was increased with bisoprolol (1.06+/-0.29 vs. 0.85+/-0.17, p < 0.0001) but not with enalapril (0.95+/-0.24 vs. 0.88+/-0.34), but this was mainly due to heart rate reduction with bisoprolol. We found no correlation between the reductions in 24-h BP and in LVM index. Bisoprolol and enalapril were similarly effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) in the office and during 24-h monitoring and in reducing the left ventricular mass index in hypertensive patients.", 
    "62": "A relative systemic hyperinsulinism, sodium retention as well as an increased cardiovascular reactivity to norepinephrine and angiotensin II in diabetics may explain the prognostically unfavorable frequent association of diabetes with high blood pressure. The first therapeutic approach against hypertension is omission of smoking and exaggerated alcohol consumption as well as of drugs which elevate blood pressure. An attempt to reach a normal body weight by means of a sodium restricted diabetes-diet is next. If blood pressures remain elevated an antihypertensive drug is prescribed in monotherapy, nowadays preferably a calcium antagonist or an ACE-inhibitor, because both of them cause few side effects, do not impair glucose and lipid homeostases and are easy to handle with a once-a-day regimen. A therapeutic algorithm is presented and consideration of the total risks of morbidity and mortality in these patients stressed.", 
    "63": "We have evaluated the effects of endothelin-1, with and without captopril administration, on the circulating concentration of aldosterone in pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) anesthetized rats. Following surgery, rats (N = 5/group) were infused with saline intravenously, at a rate of 0.024 ml/min, with or without captopril (5 mg kg-1 hr-1) administration throughout the entire experiment. All rats were allowed 60 min to stabilize and 3 X 20 min control clearances collected. Endothelin-1 (100 eta kg-1 min-1) was then added to the infusate for 30 min. Plasma aldosterone concentration increased from 60 +/- 7 eta/dl to 171 +/- 14 eta/dl (p less than 0.01) with endothelin alone and from 101 +/- 6 eta/dl to 210 +/- 54 eta/dl (p less than 0.01) in rats treated with endothelin plus captopril. The endothelin-induced increment in blood pressure was not altered by captopril treatment. However, the endothelin-induced decrement in renal function was markedly attenuated in rats treated with captopril. These data demonstrate that endothelin stimulates the release of aldosterone from the rat adrenal and that the angiotensin II is not involved in this response. These data also demonstrate that the endothelin-induced systemic vasoconstriction is not affected by captopril whereas the endothelin-induced changes in renal function are abolished by captopril.", 
    "64": "Captopril microcapsules were prepared using four different viscosity grades of ethyl cellulose (core: wall ratios 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) by temperature induced coacervation from cyclohexane. In vitro dissolution studies in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid showed that the drug release was dependent on the core to wall ratio, the viscosity grade of the ethyl cellulose and thus the total viscosity of the coacervation system. Viscosity grade of greater than 100 c.p. was unsuitable for microencapsulation by coacervation method at the concentration used. The surface characteristics of a 1:2 core to wall ratio were studied by scanning electron microscopy. The surface of the microcapsules prepared with 10 c.p. viscosity grade was comparatively more porous with larger size pores than 50 c.p. viscosity grade of ethyl cellulose. However, 300 c.p. viscosity grade showed incomplete wall formation. The microcapsules did not fragment during dissolution, alter in shape or size, or show evidence of enlargement of the surface pores. The tensile strength of tablets prepared at constant pressure from each batch of microcapsules (mean diameter 675 microns) increased as both the core to wall ratios and the viscosity of ethyl cellulose increased. The dissolution rate of the drug from tableted microcapsules was significantly delayed. The in vitro release gave best correlation with first order release kinetics when compared to zero-order and square-root-of-time equations.", 
    "65": "Once-daily administration of perindopril 4mg has been compared with captopril 25mg twice daily, atenolol 50mg once daily or a combination of hydrochlorothiazide 50mg plus amiloride 5mg once daily in double-blind studies of patients with supine diastolic blood pressures between 95 and 125mm Hg. After 3 months' treatment, the average decrease in supine systolic blood pressure with perindopril (26.5mm Hg) was significantly greater than that obtained with captopril (18.9mm Hg) and atenolol (20.6mm Hg), and non-significantly different from that achieved with the diuretic combination (30.6mm Hg). Perindopril reduced diastolic blood pressure by a greater extent than captopril (18.1 vs 11.7mm Hg), whereas the reductions were similar when compared with atenolol (17.4 vs 15.6mm Hg) and the diuretics (19.1 vs 18.4mm Hg). Target blood pressure (supine diastolic less than or equal to 90mm Hg) was achieved in 49 to 72% of patients on perindopril 4 mg/day and in an additional 15% of patients by doubling the dosage. In patients on perindopril who required an additional antihypertensive agent, a diuretic was more effective than a beta-blocker. Withdrawal rates due to adverse effects were similar in all treatment groups and ranged between 4 and 6%. Perindopril was well tolerated. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that perindopril may be considered as a suitable first-line treatment for mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "66": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. They improve the quality of life when compared with other conventional antihypertensive drugs. Perindopril, a new ACE inhibitor, is well tolerated and associated with fewer side effects than other types of antihypertensive agents. Moreover, it does not induce adverse metabolic changes such as hyperglycaemia and/or alterations in the blood lipid profile that could negate the benefits of lowering blood pressure. In hypertensive diabetic patients, perindopril decreases microalbuminuria without affecting the quality of glycaemic control and thereby may delay the progression of nephropathy. Therefore, perindopril appears to be an alternative first-line antihypertensive agent which may be useful in hypertensive diabetics.", 
    "67": "Perindopril is an orally active, non-thiol angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which in doses of 4 to 8mg is effective in the control of essential hypertension. As monotherapy it is as effective as once-daily atenolol and possibly more effective than twice-daily captopril. A synergistic response has been noted when perindopril is combined with a thiazide diuretic. Maximal pharmacodynamic effects (ACE inhibition, increase in plasma renin activity and angiotensin I, reduction in aldosterone and angiotensin II and blood pressure) are seen 4 to 6 hours after dosing, with substantial effects still present at 24 hours. Perindopril is a prodrug which requires de-esterification to perindoprilat for useful ACE inhibition. Maximal plasma perindoprilat concentrations are reached 2 to 6 hours after oral administration of perindopril, and 70% of the active metabolite is cleared by the kidneys. The other major metabolite of perindopril is an inactive glucuronide. Ageing is associated with increased serum perindoprilat concentrations, which are probably caused by a combination of enhanced conversion to the active metabolite and diminished renal clearance. Compensated cirrhosis does not appear to have an independent effect. There is little published experience of the use of perindopril in patients with cardiac failure or other cardiac disease, but preliminary evidence would support the general value of this class of agent as adjunctive therapy.", 
    "68": "Perindopril is an orally active non-thiol angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that is hydrolysed by esterases to a biologically active diacid metabolite. Perindopril decreases plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, increases plasma renin activity and reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. Most data support the hypothesis that the beneficial haemodynamic effects of perindopril are caused by ACE inhibition and the consequent reduction in angiotensin II, which either directly or indirectly results in dilatation of peripheral vessels and reduced vascular resistance. The marked blood pressure reduction after perindopril administration in hypertensive patients has not been accompanied by significant changes in heart rate. Furthermore, the lack of reflex tachycardia does not appear to be related to a reduction in baroreceptor sensitivity.", 
    "69": "Hypertension and ageing are associated with decreased arterial compliance, increased thickening of the arterial wall, hypertrophy of arterial smooth muscle cells and an increase in the collagen content of the arterial wall. Increased blood pressure has been implicated as a causative factor in such adaptive vascular alterations, however, other factors, including angiotensin II and epidermal growth factor also induce one or more of these adaptations. Long term use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril 1 mg/kg has been shown to reduce blood pressure in spontaneous and renovascular hypertensive rats. Associated with this antihypertensive effect, perindopril completely reversed aortic medial thickening, increased arterial compliance (by 42%) and decreased aortic smooth muscle cell nucleus density (by 13%), but had no significant effect on the elastin: collagen ratio of the arterial wall. In contrast, in spontaneously hypertensive animals, perindopril partially reversed aortic medial thickening and had no significant effect on arterial compliance, despite significantly increasing the arterial wall elastin: collagen ratio in this experimental group. The effect of ACE inhibition appears to directly reflect the role of angiotensin II in the pathogenesis of different hypertensive states.", 
    "70": "Knowledge of the structure, function and distribution of the components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) and the integrated physiological role of this hormonal system is rapidly increasing, although many questions remain unanswered. The primary structure and localisation of RAS such as renin, prorenin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the angiotensins have now been described. Moreover, the genes for the production of renin and ACE have been cloned and their nucleotide sequences determined. In addition to its well-established role as a circulating endocrine system, the renin-angiotensin system has more recently been ascribed a local autocrine or paracrine function. Physiologically active levels of components such as renin and angiotensin, or their messenger RNAs, have been identified in several extrarenal tissues, notably the central nervous system. The components of such tissue renin-angiotensin systems may be derived from de novo tissue synthesis and/or from the circulation by endocytosis. Angiotensin has pharmacological actions on a wide range of body tissues, including the kidney, heart, brain, gastrointestinal tract and reproductive organs. In many of these locations, angiotensin receptors have been isolated and characterised. The most firmly established roles of angiotensin are the control of blood pressure and local blood flow, and in salt and water homeostasis; the physiological significance of many of angiotensin's tissue effects is unknown. In some areas of clinical interest, such as the pathophysiology of left ventricular hypertrophy, ACE inhibitors are very useful for elucidating the possible influences of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "71": "Baroreflex function and plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) were examined in five elderly and five young or middle-aged essential hypertensive patients before and after enalapril treatment. Baroreflex sensitivity (BS) during blood pressure (BP) elevation by phenylephrine (PE) but not during BP reduction by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was significantly attenuated in the elderly compared with the younger group, while plasma Ang II concentration was not different between the two groups. Enalapril treatment reduced BP without significant changes in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine in both groups, suggesting a leftward shift of barofunction curve. It also increased the BS in some cases in each group. However, plasma Ang II was not significantly reduced during enalapril treatment. The changes in BS did not correlate with changes in plasma Ang II. These results suggest that BS may be attenuated with increasing age independent of plasma Ang II and that ACE inhibitor influences the set point of the barofunction curve and BS by different mechanisms.", 
    "72": "The present study analyzed the concentration of renin-like activity and angiotensinogen concentration (AoC) in different brain areas related to cardiovascular control in SHR and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) animals. Male rats of both strains were studied at 8, 16 and 30 weeks of age. The following brain areas were isolated: anterior, medial and posterior hypothalamus, septal area, periaqueductal gray (PG) and the remaining brain stem; nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and the remaining medulla oblongata. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AoC were determined. Renin-like concentration was higher in SHR than in WKY in the anterior hypothalamus, PG and NTS at different stages of hypertension development. AoC was also higher in some areas of the SHR brain during different periods. PRA, plasma and CSF angiotensinogen concentration showed significant differences between both strain of rats during the development of high blood pressure. Present data support the possibility that the central and peripheral renin-angiotensin system may participate in the maintenance of high blood pressure in the SHR animals.", 
    "73": "Captopril is an orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. A rapid, accurate, and sensitive high-performance chromatography (HPLC) method is described for measuring plasma concentrations of captopril. Captopril was stabilized by forming an adduct with p-bromophenacyl bromide. This adduct was measured by HPLC using a C-18 reverse-phase column and monitoring the column effluent by ultraviolet absorption at 260 nm. The method proved to be linear in the clinical range of 10-1,000 ng/ml. The plasma levels of captopril in a young patient given a small oral dose were determined by this method.", 
    "74": "Hemodynamic and hormonal effects of captopril were prospectively studied in 12 children (median age 5.8 years, range 4 weeks to 15 years) with dilated cardiomyopathy. A mean dose of 1.83 mg captopril/kg body weight was administered in three or four single doses depending on age. Left ventricular volume, ejection fraction (EF), cardiac index (CI), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were noninvasively determined by two-dimensional (2D) and Doppler echocardiography before and 2 days and 3 months after the onset of treatment. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded as well. Additionally, on the day hemodynamic measurements were made, plasma renin activity (PRA), serum aldosterone, and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations were determined. Plasma catecholamines were measured before and 2 days after captopril treatment. Concomitant medication was kept constant during the short-term phase of captopril treatment. During long-term therapy, diuretics were reduced according to the clinical status. Stroke volume (SVI) (-7%), end-systolic (ESVI) (-31%), and end-diastolic (EDVI) (-21%) volume indexes were significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) during short- and long-term therapy. The remaining hemodynamic parameters showed only minor, statistically not significant, changes. During short-term therapy, median serum aldosterone levels fell from 138-88.5 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and plasma ANP decreased from 144-94 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). After 3 months these effects were less marked and statistically no longer significant. Changes in PRA and plasma catecholamines were not statistically significant at any time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor density was higher in many brain regions of untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared to untreated Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) animals. Systemic inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with enalapril (25 mg/kg, per os for 14 days) produces a large decrease in ANG II receptors localized exclusively in the subfornical organ (SFO) of the SHR, and no alterations in ANG II receptors in the normotensive WKY rats. Selective decrease of ANG II receptors in the SFO of the genetically hypertensive rats with enalapril may be related to its therapeutic efficacy.", 
    "76": "In confirmation of previous studies, the amount of epinephrine released into blood during electrical stimulation of the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord in pithed rats on a low-sodium diet (0.01% sodium by weight of diet for 1 mo) was significantly greater than that observed in rats on a normal sodium diet (0.3% sodium by weight of diet). The present work assessed the extent to which endogenously formed angiotensin II influences this neurally mediated adrenal epinephrine release. The augmented release of epinephrine in rats maintained on the low-sodium diet appeared to depend on circulating angiotensin II because blockade of angiotensin II receptors with saralasin decreased the epinephrine release in these animals but not in rats maintained on the normal diet. Similar results were obtained when the renin-angiotensin system was blocked with the converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril. Adrenal epinephrine content was not affected by the dietary sodium intake; however, the catecholamine synthetic capacity was augmented as indicated by a significant induction of tyrosine hydroxylase. In addition, the adrenal medullary angiotensin II receptor density was significantly elevated in animals on the low-sodium diet. These results demonstrate that endogenous angiotensin II is capable of providing a positive modulatory influence on neurally mediated release of adrenal epinephrine, an effect that may require a chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system as occurs naturally with restricted dietary sodium intake.", 
    "77": "Peptidases degrade neuropeptides and thereby limit the duration and extent of their influence. This investigation examined the importance of peptidases in the degradation of the neuropeptide enkephalin in the stomach wall of the rat. Metabolism of [Leu5]- and [D-Ala2][Leu5]enkephalin by gastric membranes was examined in vitro. Degradation of [Tyr1-3H][Leu5]enkephalin was studied in the gastric submucosa of anesthetized and conscious rats in vivo by using a catheter to deliver peptide to tissues and implanted dialysis fibers to collect the metabolites. Specific inhibitors were used to assess the contribution of particular enzymes. [Leu5]- and [Tyr1-3H][Leu5]enkephalin were metabolized by membranes and in the stomach wall by hydrolysis of the Tyr1-Gly2 bond. Degradation was inhibited by the aminopeptidase inhibitor amastatin (10(-5) M in vitro, 10 nmol in vivo). Inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (phosphoramidon) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (captopril) did not inhibit degradation. Metabolism of the aminopeptidase-resistant analogue [D-Ala2][Leu5]enkephalin by membranes was unaffected by amastatin and weakly inhibited by phosphoramidon affected by amastatin and weakly inhibited by phosphoramidon and captopril. A carboxypeptidase removed the COOH-terminal leucine residue and made a substantial contribution to degradation of both peptides by gastric membranes.", 
    "78": "The current study was designed to evaluate the role of angiotesin II (ANG II) in the regulation of renin mRNA and angiotensinogen mRNA levels. We investigated the changes in renin mRNA levels in the kidney and angiotensinogen mRNA levels in the liver induced by ANG II infusion and by inhibition of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system with enalapril or saralasin in rats. mRNAs for angiotensinogen and renin were measured by densitometric analysis of Northern blot hybridization. After a 4-h intravenous infusion of ANG II (0.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), angiotensinogen mRNA level in the liver increased 2.5-fold to the control level, and renin mRNA level in the kidney decreased by 45%. Four hours after treatment with a single dose of enalapril (3 mg/kg po), angiotensinogen mRNA level in the liver decreased by 50%, and renin mRNA level in the kidney increased 1.5-fold to the control level. These mRNA levels returned to control levels 8 h after treatment. After a 4-h infusion of saralasin (2.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) in the low-sodium state, angiotensinogen mRNA level in the liver decreased by 45%, and renin mRNA level in the kidney increased twofold to the control level. These findings suggest that ANG II is one of the factors that regulate angiotensinogen mRNA level in the liver and renin mRNA level in the kidney.", 
    "79": "The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril (10 mg/kg i.v.) on CBF autoregulation was studied in 16 spontaneously hypertensive rats (8 control and 8 treated with captopril) subjected to acute cervical sympathectomy. CBF was measured repetitively by the intra-arterial 133Xe injection method, during the manipulation of MABP by norepinephrine or hemorrhagic hypotension. Prior to the administration of drugs, baseline MABP was 112 +/- 10 mm Hg in the control group and 119 +/- 11 mm Hg in the captopril group. Baseline CBF was 99 +/- 19 ml/100 g/min, with no difference in the two groups. In agreement with previous findings in rats with intact sympathetic nerves, the lower limit of CBF autoregulation was reduced from the MABP interval of 70-89 to 50-69 mm Hg by captopril.", 
    "80": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system during open heart surgery may have consequences both beneficial in sustaining blood pressure and deleterious in compromising renal hemodynamics. The influence of short-term pretreatment with captopril on blood pressure and renal function was assessed double-blind versus placebo in 18 patients without pre-existing cardiac or renal failure, and undergoing coronary artery bypass. No difference in blood pressure and fluid requirement during the surgical period was observed between groups receiving captopril or placebo. Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate decreased in the placebo group whereas they remained unaltered in the captopril group; during cardiopulmonary bypass, urinary excretion of sodium was greater in patients receiving captopril than those receiving placebo. These results suggest that captopril pretreatment does not compromise the control of blood pressure and renal function during open heart surgery; additional studies on the protective value of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are warranted in patients at higher risk for developing renal failure.", 
    "81": "The Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure has recently recommended angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics as potential first-step agents for the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors should be considered an important option in most patients because of their safety profile, absence of adverse metabolic effects, and positive cardiac and renal effects. If the response to an ACE inhibitor is inadequate, a diuretic or another agent can be added, and this combination should be effective and well tolerated in 85% to 90% of patients. ACE inhibitors can be used to treat congestive heart failure and to prevent the renal complications of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, significantly expanding their use in patients with these high-risk conditions. They also can be used concurrently with other antihypertensive agents, digitalis, cardiac glycosides, and lithium and are not contraindicated in most of the diseases commonly seen in hypertensive patients.", 
    "82": "This experiment was designed to investigate the effect of converting enzyme inhibition on functional and structural vascular alterations in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats and in normotensive rats. Starting 1 day before surgery, 100 mg/kg/day captopril was given chronically to half of the hypertensive and normotensive groups in their drinking water. With use of intravital microscopy in the cremaster muscle, arteriolar dimensions were measured 4 weeks later, both before and after topical application of 10(-3) M adenosine. Mean blood pressure was 124 +/- 4 mm Hg in control rats and 103 +/- 5 mm Hg in captopril-treated control rats (p less than 0.05). Mean blood pressure was significantly elevated to 183 +/- 5 mm Hg in captopril-treated one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats and 193 +/- 5 mm Hg in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. With use of histological techniques, a marked reduction of medial-intimal area of the abdominal aorta was found in captopril-treated control rats (24%), and hypertrophy of the aortic wall in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats was decreased 26% by captopril. Structural diameter reductions occurred in large arterioles of the captopril-treated control and hypertensive groups and the nontreated hypertensive group. In spite of a significant increase in wall-to-lumen ratio of first-order arterioles in all captopril-treated rats, captopril decreased cross-sectional wall area of these vessels 37% in hypertensive and 20% in control rats, respectively. Measured by stereological techniques, small arteriolar density decreased 30% in captopril-treated hypertensive rats and 17% in captopril-treated control rats. Therefore, smaller arteriolar lumens, decreased aortic and arteriolar cross-sectional wall area, and arteriolar rarefaction after converting enzyme inhibition, in spite of rising or falling blood pressure, are evidence that vascular growth was inhibited in vivo.", 
    "83": "A series of L-alanyl-4 or 5-substituted L-prolines, such as L-alanyl-L-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, L-alanyl-5-oxo-L-proline, L-alanyl-trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline and L-alanyl-cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline as well as their corresponding N alpha-phosphoryl derivatives, were synthesized and studied for inhibition against angiotensin converting enzyme. Furanacryloyl-phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine was used as substrate in 50 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer at pH 7.5 containing 1 microM zinc acetate. N alpha-Phosphoryl-L-alanyl-L-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid and N alpha-phosphoryl-L-alanyl-trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline competitively inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme with Ki values of 68 microM and 89.3 microM, respectively. Smaller inhibition against angiotensin converting enzyme was obtained with the rest of compounds studied here.", 
    "84": "Several studies have demonstrated that enalapril causes a clinical and hemodynamic improvement in patients with congestive heart failure. Nevertheless, the drug capability of influencing left ventricular systolic and diastolic indexes has not been evaluated. In 12 patients with severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class III-IV), treated with digitalis and diuretics, we performed a baseline evaluation through a right heart catheterization, echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography. The effects on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function indexes after the administration of enalapril 5 mg by oral route have been evaluated. After 3 months of chronic therapy with enalapril 5 mg twice daily, we performed a further evaluation through echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography. At the acute test we observed a significant improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular stroke index (LVSI), and peak of filling rate (PFR), with a significant reduction of pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). After 3 months of chronic therapy EF was significantly increased with respect to baseline values (37 +/- 6.9% vs 28.7 +/- 7.9%, p less than 0.05) and showed a further increase after the drug administration (from 37 +/- 6.9% to 48 +/- 5.4%, p less than 0.001). PFR showed a similar behaviour and reached at the follow-up evaluation normal values (from 1.97 +/- 0.7 edv/s to 2.57 +/- 0.6 efv/s, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, the echocardiographic dimensions of the left ventricle decreased significantly with a significant increase of shortening fraction. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that in patients with severe congestive heart failure enalapril improves the left ventricular systolic and diastolic function indexes and this improvement is persistent.", 
    "85": "Joint studies of the ALIMDA and Society of Actuaries, notably those of 1935, 1959 and 1979, established that there is a progressive rise in cardiovascular mortality with successive increments in blood pressure. This has provided the basis of underwriting. The converse is not true, or at least has not been true until very recently. Drugs that effectively reduce blood pressure have been available for several decades, but reduction and maintenance of blood pressure is still accomplished in only a minority of hypertensives. Long-term trials employing a combination of drugs, i.e., diuretics, vasodilators and reserpine and subsequently beta-blockers, almost without fail have not shown that treatment with these agents significantly reduces heart disease mortality and sudden death. This has been attributed, perhaps without basis, to an unfavorable countering effect of increased lipid levels, aggravating this risk factor, and other undesirable metabolic effect of diuretics, such as hypokalemia and depletion of body magnesium, increasing the propensity to ventricular arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, worsening diabetes, and hyperuricemia. A survey of 674 persons with hypertension seen personally during the period 1985-89, who were under the care of approximately that many physicians, reveals striking changes in drug prescription and use during this brief period that portend a major change in the outlook of hypertension. Two classes of drugs have increased rapidly in popularity: these are the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and the calcium blockers. Both classes of drugs effectively lower blood pressure and have minimal side effects with good compliance. They act not only to reduce peripheral vascular resistance, but also locally in the heart muscle to directly cause left ventricular hypertrophy to regress, an effect of great consequence. The drugs used in former trials such as the vasodilators and diuretics have no effect on left ventricular hypertrophy, unlike the ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists. Left ventricular hypertrophy is the key lesion in hypertension and is only in part due to increased work load imposed by elevated pressure. It is associated with elevated blood pressure, but not closely and occurs independently; ventricular myocytes as well as myocytes of the vasculature being stimulated to growth by angiotensin and calcium, potentiating the effect of norepinephrine. Left ventricular hypertrophy greatly increases the propensity to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death, and is a prime cause of cardiac mortality and sudden death not only in hypertension, but also in obesity, aging and diabetes, in which conditions left ventricular hypertrophy also is very common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "86": "Perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is converted in vivo to its active diacid metabolite, perindoprilat and to a perindoprilat glucuronide. The pharmacokinetic parameters of perindopril, perindoprilat and perindoprilat glucuronide were evaluated after single administration to healthy volunteers (N = 12) of 8 mg of perindopril tert-butylamine salt by oral route (treatment A), by intravenous route (bolus in 5 min, treatment B) and of an equimolar dose of perindoprilat (6.1 mg) by intravenous route (infusion over 2 h, treatment C). The treatments were administered as a randomised 3-way cross-over design. Plasma samples were collected up to 96 h and urines up to 120 h. Perindopril is rapidly absorbed with an oral bioavailability of 95% and is mainly eliminated by metabolic processes. The formation of perindoprilat is slow and about 20% of the available parent drug is transformed into this metabolite. Elimination profile of perindoprilat is biphasic, with a rapid renal excretion of the free fraction and a long terminal half-life of the fraction bound to ACE. Perindoprilat glucuronide is mainly obtained from perindopril by a pre-systemic first pass metabolism.", 
    "87": "To determine whether pharmacological control of blood pressure could affect the renal function and its deterioration in SHR with renal ablation, we studied effects of oral administration of captopril (50 mg/kg/day) and ramipril (10 mg/kg/day), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), nilvadipine (10 mg/kg/day) and benidipine (3-6 mg/kg/day), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and indapamide (10 mg/kg/day), a non-thiazide diuretic, for 2 and 12 weeks on systolic blood pressure (SBP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr), and urinary protein excretion (UP) in SHR subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy a week before. Three weeks after the surgery, SBP (mmHg) in the untreated group was 253 +/- 8.9 (n = 11), captopril group 156 +/- 8.9 (n = 7, p less than 0.05), ramipril group 176 +/- 12 (n = 7, p less than 0.05), nilvadipine group 146 +/- 8.8 (n = 7, p less than 0.05), and benidipine group 197 +/- 8.5 (n = 7, p less than 0.05). Monotherapy with indapamide (206 +/- 4.8, n = 7, p less than 0.05) induced only a slight decrease in the SBP. Thirteen weeks after the surgery, SBP in the untreated group was 270 +/- 6.9 (n = 14), in the captopril group 191 +/- 4.8 (n = 7, p less than 0.05), in the ramipril group 160 +/- 9.5 (n = 7, p less than 0.05), in the nilvadipine group 177 +/- 13.2 (n = 7, p less than 0.05), and in the benidipine group 150 +/- 4.9 (n = 7, p less than 0.05). BUN was lower in the captopril and nilvadipine groups but not in the other treatment groups compared with the untreated group. Scr was lower in the ACEI groups. Ccr was higher in the ACEI and benidipine groups. UP was lower in all treatment groups. These results indicate that the similar reduction of SBP by ACEI and CCB has the potential to preserve renal function and to lessen renal damage in this model. Furthermore, they also suggest that ACEI have the potential to ameliorate renal function in this model. However, it remains to be determined why, despite the similar effects on SBP, deterioration of renal function in this model was prevented only by treatment with the ACEI, but not with the CCB.", 
    "88": "Ten patients (6 men, 4 women, age range 35-64 years) with glomerulopathies were studied. Diagnoses were membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (GN; n = 4), membranous GN (n = 3), focal and diffuse glomerulosclerosis (n = 2), and poststreptococcal GN (n = 1). These were confirmed by renal biopsy in 8 of the 10 patients. All patients had reduced function (creatinine clearance 15-55 ml/min); proteinuria ranged from 1.0 to 10.4 g/day. Three normotensive patients received enalapril 10 mg once daily. Seven hypertensives received enalapril 10-40 mg once daily to control blood pressure (BP). Concomitant diuretic therapy (furosemide/bumetanide) was administered to 6 patients. There were visits every 14 days for a mean of 15.9 months (range 9-26 months). Diet was monitored, and BP was significantly controlled in the hypertensive patients but not altered in the normotensives. Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine clearance, and 24-hour urinary protein improved and did not deteriorate progressively. Serum potassium did not change significantly. No adverse clinical events were noted. Enalapril therapy may improve the prognosis for GN over time by maintaining glomerular filtration rate and decreasing proteinuria.", 
    "89": "We evaluated the antihypertensive mechanism of enalapril, a long-lasting inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, in rats made hypertensive by chronic infusion of norepinephrine or vasopressin. The hypertensive effect of norepinephrine (1.8 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal (i.p.] or vasopressin (7.2 U/kg/day i.p.) was completely abolished by simultaneous administration of enalapril (6 mg/kg/day i.p.). The antihypertensive effect of enalapril was not reversed by simultaneous administration of subpressor doses of angiotensin II (36 and 100 micrograms/kg/day i.p.). However, the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II at pressor doses (600 and 900 micrograms/kg/day i.p.) in enalapril-infused rats were not different from those in vehicle-infused rats. These results indicate that the hypotensive effect of enalapril may in part depend on a reduced sensitivity of the vasculature to norepinephrine and vasopressin, independent of inhibition of angiotensin II formation.", 
    "90": "We examined whether long-term antihypertensive monotherapy with enalapril decreased clinical casual blood pressure (BP) as well as BP at work and during stress, and whether this angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor had an adverse effect on the physiologic hemodynamic pattern during experimental mental stress. Seventeen male patients with hitherto untreated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (mean age: 47 +/- 8 years) had 24-hour BP monitored noninvasively with the Physioport system before and during treatment with enalapril (5-10 mg/day) for 6 months. They also had a mental stress test, physical exercise test, and the cold pressor test before and after therapy. After the diagnostic observation period, average clinical casual BP was 150 +/- 12/102 +/- 7 mg Hg. Average BP at work, stress BP during all types of stimulation in the laboratory, and clinical casual BP significantly decreased during monotherapy with enalapril. Neither the circadian rhythm nor the hemodynamic pattern during mental stress was significantly altered by enalapril. BP increases during emotional stress were not significantly attenuated by the ACE inhibitor. These results demonstrated that enalapril effectively lowers BP without altering the physiologic hemodynamic pattern during emotional stress.", 
    "91": "We analyzed the effect of enalapril (0.1 mg/kg p.o. twice daily) on plasma electrolytes, urea, and creatinine in low cardiac output failure. In 14 male dogs implanted with chronic instrumentation, tachycardia was induced by ventricular pacing (265 impulses/min., 10-14 days). In 7 untreated dogs, pacing progressively lowered aortic flow by 44% and induced hyponatremia and elevations of plasma urea, creatinine, and potassium. Treatment with enalapril (n = 7) during pacing reduced the decrease in aortic flow by 33% and prevented changes in plasma urea, potassium, and sodium. We conclude that this is due to enalapril-induced retardation of heart failure progression.", 
    "92": "While monotherapy sometimes controls blood pressure (BP), it is often essential to add a second drug for adequate control. This study examined in a factorial fashion the interaction of enalapril with some commonly used antihypertensive therapies. There were between 10 and 16 patients in each study, and the patients had responded in part to the two drugs used. Enalapril and sodium restriction lowered BP 12 +/- 3/11 +/- 2 and 4 +/- 2/3 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. The effects of the two therapies were additive, and there was no interaction. Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide lowered BP 11 +/- 3/8 +/- 3 and 8 +/- 2/6 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. The effect of the two drugs together indicated a positive interaction of 4 +/- 2/3 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Enalapril and nifedipine both lowered BP (10 +/- 2/8 +/- 1 and 11 +/- 3/8 +/- 1 mm Hg). The two drugs combined had a strongly positive interaction of 10 +/- 3/7 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Enalapril can be used with the other therapeutic methods tested. If a converting enzyme inhibitor does not reduce BP adequately, it appears appropriate to add a thiazide diuretic or a slow-channel calcium-blocking drug. The mechanism of the positive interaction with diuretics probably reflects an effect on the renin-angiotensin system, but the explanation for the synergism with slow-channel calcium-blocking drugs is unclear.", 
    "93": "To investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on renal outcome in patients with renal insufficiency, a 2-part study was conducted. Part A consisted of a retrospective 1-year analysis of 80 hypertensive outpatients with serum creatinine levels of 1.5-6 mg/dl, 39 of whom received ACE inhibitors and other antihypertensive agents and 41 of whom received only other antihypertensive agents. Median serum creatinine levels in the ACE group rose acutely from 2.33 to 2.7 mg/dl after 1 month of therapy and remained stable thereafter. Serum creatinine levels more than doubled in 2 patients. In controls, median serum creatinine levels rose gradually over 12 months from 2.39 to 3.45 mg/dl, and serum creatinine more than doubled in 9 patients. Part B consisted of a prospective follow-up of patients for a second year; 34 patients in the treatment group and 32 controls were then analyzed; median serum creatinine level was 3.0 vs. 4.4 mg/dl after 2 years; 2 of 34 vs. 6 of 32 patients were on dialysis; serum creatinine level had more than doubled in 4 of 34 vs. 8 of 32. These results suggest that ACE inhibitors are more effective than other antihypertensive agents in reducing the progression of renal failure.", 
    "94": "Continuous therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has been shown to have a glomerular vasodepressor effect in the newly diabetic rat and to largely prevent subsequent development of severe sclerosing glomerular injury. Preliminary studies in humans with established diabetic glomerular injury reveal that ACE inhibitor therapy has an antiproteinuric effect and may also slow the decline in glomerular filtration rate that usually attends this disorder. Although promising, the human studies are inconclusive because of short duration and other limitations in experimental technique and study design. Additional trials are required to confirm more positively this amelioration of human diabetic glomerular injury by ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "95": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single oral dose benazepril.HCl 10 mg have been studied in 15 healthy volunteers aged 65 to 80 y. The kinetics of unchanged benazepril and its active metabolite benazeprilat did not differ significantly in males and females, so the combined kinetic data from all 15 elderly subjects were compared with a historical control group of 19-32 year-old healthy men treated in the same way. The disposition of benazepril was not affected by age. The time to maximum plasma concentration, tmax (0.5 h) and elimination half-life (0.6 h) in the elderly were the same as in young subjects. The kinetics of benazeprilat was slightly changed in the elderly; although its tmax (1.5 h) was not affected, Cmax and the AUC were 20-40% greater. The elimination half-life of benazeprilat during the first 24 h after dosing in the elderly was increased by about 20% to 3.2 h. The renal plasma clearance of benazeprilat (18.1 ml.min-1) was about 20% smaller than in the young subjects. An average of 18.5% of the dose was recovered as benazeprilat in the 24 h urine from the elderly subjects, which was similar to the recovery in the young subjects. Both benazepril and benazeprilat were highly bound to serum proteins (96 and 95%, respectively). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the elderly were reduced by a maximum of 37/16 mm Hg at 6 h, in association with a small rise in pulse rate.

Diagnosis was established by renal biopsy in 12 of the 14 patients. All 14 patients had impaired renal function (creatinine clearance = 25 to 55 ml/min) and proteinuria (1.0 to 10.4 g/day). Five normotensive patients received enalapril 20 mg/day, whereas 9 patients with hypertension received 20 to 40 mg/day to control blood pressure. Diuretics were administered concomitantly to 8 patients. Patients attended the clinic every 14 days for 30 months and their diets were closely monitored, with sodium intake limited to between 50 and 100 mEq/day and protein to between 1.0 and 1.2 g/kg/day. Blood pressure was significantly controlled in the patients with hypertension. Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine clearance and 24-hour urinary protein excretion all significantly improved during the 30-month study. No adverse clinical events were noted. Thus, over a period of time, enalapril therapy may improve the prognosis of patients with glomerulonephritis by maintaining glomerular filtration rates and decreasing proteinuria and blood pressure.", 
    "97": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics are known to cause hyperkalaemia. We undertook a prospective analysis over a period of six months of patients admitted under our care. Of 217 patients, 39 (18 per cent) were admitted with congestive cardiac failure/left ventricular failure. Of these 39 patients, 21 (54 per cent) were prescribed ACE inhibitors. Seven of these 21 patients subsequently developed hypokalaemia. This was irrespective of the type or dose of the diuretic but seemed to be related to the dose of the ACE inhibitor. In three cases the hypokalaemia was corrected by the addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic; in two cases a potassium supplement was added; and in the other three an increase in the dose of the ACE inhibitor for the resistant heart failure corrected the potassium deficit. This study shows that one should be alert to both hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia when using a combination of ACE inhibitors and diuretics.", 
    "98": "Cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens are known to produce intense nausea and vomiting. Angiotensin II (AII) and vasopressin (AVP) have been shown to have emetic properties. The role of these two peptides on cisplatin-induced vomiting was investigated in beagle dogs. Cisplatin (2 mg/kg, IV over 5 min) produced consistent emesis in all dogs after a mean latency time of 144 +/- 4 min. Serum Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) and plasma AII levels did not significantly change 3 hr after cisplatin administration (at the time of nausea and emesis) in control animals. AVP levels rose from 0.3 pg/ml to 7.5 pg/ml 3 hrs after cisplatin. Complete inhibition of ACE with enalapril (given at 3 mg/kg p.o., 3 hrs prior to cisplatin) reduced AII levels by 70%, but failed to significantly modify the increase in AVP levels (7.2 +/- 2.2 pg/ml), the latency time to emesis (149 +/- 2 min) and the number of emetic episodes induced by cisplatin. These results suggest that AII does not mediate cisplatin-induced emesis, nor does it mediate the increase in AVP observed at the time of emesis. We propose that AVP may be a good marker for nausea and emesis, and that increases in AVP may be neurally-mediated. The large increase in circulating AVP may represent a desirable water conservation response in anticipation of fluid losses induced by vomiting.",

Correlation of animal data with previous case reports of neonatal anuria in association with maternal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors suggests that these agents may have a deleterious effect on fetal renal development and general well-being.", 
    "100": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in renovascular hypertension is associated with acute compromise of renal function in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or with arterial stenosis to a single functioning kidney. Recent evidence has suggested that renal function is also compromised in the stenosed kidney of patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis. The long-term consequence of this reduction in renal function is not known. We have studied the effect of chronic ACE inhibition with enalapril on renal structure and function in rats with the two-kidney one-clip model of renovascular hypertension. Four weeks after placement of a clip on the left renal artery, hypertensive rats were randomized to treatment with enalapril, minoxidil, or to a no treatment group. Twelve months later split kidney function was determined by chromium 51-labeled ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid clearance in surviving rats. Clearance of the clipped kidney was 0.0 ml/min (enalapril group), 0.26 +/- 0.23 ml/min (minoxidil group), and 0.74 +/- 0.13 ml/min (untreated group). The clipped kidney from the enalapril treated rats weighed much less than the minoxidil group or the untreated group (0.46 +/- 0.1 gm, 1.2 +/- 0.07 gm, and 1.14 +/- 0.10 gm, respectively). Enalapril treatment was stopped for 2 weeks in five rats. The clipped kidney remained small and nonfunctional. Histologic examination revealed marked interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy of the clipped kidneys from the enalapril treated group in contrast to minor changes in the minoxidil treated and untreated groups. After 12 months of treatment, survival in the enalapril group was 84%, 48% in the minoxidil group, and 15% in the untreated group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "101": "Physicians should suspect ACE inhibitors as the cause of cough in patients whose symptom begins soon after the institution of therapy with this class of drugs. This is particularly important in patients without a personal or family history of atopy, with normal physical findings, chest radiographs, and lung function tests. Rather than subjecting the patient to an extensive workup, substitution of a different antihypertensive agent is an inexpensive way to show whether the ACE inhibitor is the cause of the chronic cough.", 
    "102": "The cardiac and hemodynamic effects of 3 doses (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, iv) of spiraprilat, the diacid active metabolite of the new angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor spirapril, have been investigated and compared to those of saline in chronically implanted conscious dogs at rest. Under a normal sodium diet, spiraprilat, 1 mg/kg, induced significant (at least P less than 0.05) decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP, -11%), total peripheral resistance (TPR, -21%), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP, -15%) and increases in heart rate (HR, +12%) and cardiac output (CO, +16%) whereas dP/dtmax remained unchanged. Spiraprilat-induced tachycardia was not modified by propranolol pre-treatment but was abolished by previous administration of the propranolol-N-methylatropine combination. Spiraprilat, 0.1 mg/kg, did not affect any parameter, but spiraprilat, 0.3 mg/kg, showed intermediate effects. Finally, sodium depletion strongly potentiated spiraprilat effects on MAP, TPR, LVEDP, HR and CO. We conclude that: a), in conscious dogs under normal sodium diet, spiraprilat reduces TPR and MAP through peripheral vasodilating properties; b), spiraprilat-induced tachycardia is mainly related to parasympathetic tone withdrawal, possibly in relation with high and low pressure baroreceptors deactivation; and c), sodium depletion considerably potentiates spiraprilat cardiac and hemodynamic effects.", 
    "103": "In a double-blind 3-month study in mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients over 50 years of age, ketanserin, a selective S2-serotoninergic antagonist with additional alpha 1-adrenergic blocking properties, has been compared with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Supine and upright blood pressures and heart rates were recorded for placebo and during active treatment (-4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks). Metabolic profile (plasma glucose, creatinine, sodium, potassium, total and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid) was monitored during treatment with placebo and at the end of the study. Mean blood pressure was equally and significantly (p less than 0.001) lowered by both drugs from 2 weeks of treatment, whereas no changes occurred in mean heart rate or in biochemical variables. Dizziness was observed in three patients on ketanserin and in one patient on enalapril, whereas headache occurred in only one patient on enalapril. These data indicate that ketanserin is as effective and well tolerated as enalapril in hypertensive patients over 50 years of age.", 
    "104": "The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the combination of ketanserin with captopril exerts an additive antihypertensive effect, as compared with single drug treatment. Twelve patients with uncomplicated moderate essential hypertension received, according to a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, ketanserin (40 mg twice daily), captopril (50 mg twice daily), the combination of the two drugs at these dosages, and the corresponding placebo, each treatment being given for 1 month. Both ketanserin and captopril as monotherapy similarly and significantly reduced blood pressure as compared with placebo (p less than 0.001). The combination treatment of ketanserin plus captopril further and significantly reduced blood pressure when compared with single drug treatment (p less than 0.001). Moreover, the percentage of responders and patients whose blood pressure was normalized were significantly greater under the combined treatment than under ketanserin or captopril monotherapy (p less than 0.001). These data indicate that the combination of ketanserin plus captopril exerts a clear additive antihypertensive effect when compared with each treatment as monotherapy, a finding that suggests this combination can be usefully employed in the treatment of hypertensive patients.",

    "106": "Hypertension is among the most ubiquitous diseases in the world. In the U.S., up to sixty million individuals may be affected by hypertension and be prone to associated renal, cardiac, and CNS damage. This morbidity is mediated by changes in the microcirculation of these organs, resultant of blood pressure elevation.", 
    "107": "1. Effects of inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) in brain on psychomotor, exploratory, stereotyped and cognitive behaviour in rats were investigated. To inhibit brain ACE captopril (D-3-mercaptopropanoyl-L-proline) was given orally (p.o., 50 mg/kg) or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v., 5 micrograms/rat). 3. Captopril given p.o. but not i.c.v. significantly enhanced stereotypy, overall number of conditioned avoidance responses, and decreased blood pressure. 4. No statistically significant influence of captopril given by either route on the number of crossings, rearings and bar approaches in the open field, performance of passive avoidance and number of correct choices as well as the speed of running for food in the T-maze was observed. 5. In conclusion, a small decrease of the activity of nigrostriatal dopaminergic system caused by the decrease of AII and/or increase of bradykinin, substance P, enkephalins and neurotensin in brain resulting from ACE inhibition is postulated.", 
    "108": "Salvia miltiorrhiza cell culture extract (SCE) was shown to produce dose-dependent hypotensive response in normo-tensive rats. The mode of this hypotensive action was studied both in vivo and in vitro. This vasodepressor effect was not due to the presence of cations (potassium, calcium and magnesium) in the extract. In pharmacological antagonist studies, the hypotensive effect was shown not being mediated via the alpha-, beta-adrenoceptors, histamine receptors and autonomic ganglion; nor via direct vasodilation and diuresis. However, the vasodepressor effect was probably angiotensin- and/or bradykinin-related since captopril infusion potentiated the hypotensive effect of SCE. Furthermore, data indicated that the vasodepressor effect might be accounted for by the positive inotropic and negative chronotropic effects of SCE, the latter via its modulation of cholinergic activity.", 
    "109": "Fourteen patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus had the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP) investigated. In 8 of the patients the effect of Captopril on ICP and CBF was also investigated. The mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was 109 mmHg (intra-arterially), and ICP was 11 mmHg (intraventricularly). Changes in global CBF were estimated by the arterio-venous oxygen difference method. The autoregulation of CBF was present in 13 of the patients (p less than 0.01). The lower limit of CBF autoregulation was 86% of the baseline perfusion pressure. One hour after 50 mg of captopril perorally, MABP was reduced 16 mmHg, and ICP and CBF were unchanged. The autoregulation was maintained and the lower limit was decreased 19 mmHg. Thus patients would be expected to benefit from captopril treatment in hypotensive anaesthesia.", 
    "110": "Rat kidney slices were incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline and placed into a superfusion chamber between two platinum electrodes. The kidney slices accumulated and stored radioactivity. In kidney slices taken from rats whose sympathetic nerve terminals were destroyed by pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine accumulation of radioactivity was abolished. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.1-1 microM) enhanced but tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 microM) or omission of calcium from the superfusion solution abolished the stimulation induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity. Angiotensin (A) I (3-300 nM) and AII (1-100 nM) enhanced S-I outflow of radioactivity. The effect of AI was markedly attenuated by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (3 microM) and that of AII was blocked by the AII receptor antagonist saralasin (1 microM). These results suggest that the kidney slice preparation is a valid technique to study modulation of renal noradrenaline release. Endogenous noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerves in rat kidney slices activates prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors to inhibit its own release. AII, which can also be formed locally from AI in these kidney slices, activates prejunctional AII receptors to facilitate renal noradrenaline release.", 
    "111": "Sequential histologic and ultrastructural changes in juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) were defined in male rats treated with quinapril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Doses of 0, 10, 100, and 400 mg/kg were administered daily by gavage for up to 4 weeks. Granular juxtaglomerular (JG) cells were normal or hypogranular on Day 1 at all doses and were hypergranular by Day 7 in rats given 100 and 400 mg/kg relative to age-matched controls. Histologically, JGA hypertrophy was apparent by Day 7 at all doses and was most pronounced by Day 14 in intermediate and deep cortical zones of rats given 100 and 400 mg/kg. Ultrastructurally, hypertrophic JG cells had abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes, and prominent Golgi complexes associated with numerous cytoplasmic coated vesicles. Dose-dependent increases in numbers of protogranules, altered granules, and cytoplasmic vacuoles occurred in association with decreased size and increased pleomorphism of mature secretory granules. Granule alterations included vesicular to lamellar membranous matrical inclusions, irregular patterns of osmiophilia, matrical vacuolation, and flocculent to coarsely granular matrix of greater density than mature granules. We concluded that JG cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia occurred rapidly in response to subchronic ACE inhibition. Further, ultrastructural changes in JG cells were indicative of stimulated renin synthesis by a regulated pathway, renin secretion by exocytosis and cytoplasmic solubilization of granules, and autophagy of granules as a mechanism whereby JG cells regulate levels of stored renin under conditions of excessive stimulation.", 
    "112": "The effect of 18 months' inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by captopril on the leakage of fluorescein through the blood-retina barrier was examined in a prospective, randomized control study of 20 normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with nephropathy and background retinopathy. After 18 months, 15 patients remained in the study. Fluorescein leakage remained nearly unchanged in the captopril-treated group, being 4.1 +/- 4.1 (mean +/- SD) x 10(-7) cm/s at baseline and 4.2 +/- 4.1 x 10(-7) cm/s after 18 months' treatment. The permeability increased significantly (P less than 0.01) from 3.3 +/- 2.2 x 10(-7) cm/s to 5.6 +/- 3.5 x 10(-7) cm/s at 18 months in the control group. Arterial blood pressure was nearly constant in both groups throughout the study. The results indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril can arrest or delay a progressive breakdown of the blood-retina barrier in normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with nephropathy and background retinopathy.", 
    "113": "We have investigated the effects of endogenous angiotensin II (ANG II) on hepatic angiotensinogen mRNA levels in rats. Changes in endogenous ANG II were induced by various sodium intakes (standard-, low-, and high-sodium) or by enalapril treatment. In a low sodium state for 2 weeks, angiotensinogen mRNA levels and plasma ANG II concentration increased 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold compared to those in standard sodium state, respectively. In a high sodium state, angiotensinogen mRNA levels and plasma ANG II concentration decreased by 42% and 56% compared to the standard sodierm state, respectively. Four hours after treatment with enalapril (3 mg/kg), angiotensinogen mRNA level and plasma ANG II concentration decreased by 25% and 12% compared to the standard sodium state, respectively. There was a close correlation between angiotensinogen mRNA level and plasma ANG II concentration (r = 0.79, P less than 0.01). These results suggest that endogenous ANG II may play an important role in the regulation of hepatic angiotensinogen synthesis.", 
    "114": "The renal, metabolic and antihypertensive effects of enalapril (E) and slow-release verapamil (V) were compared in a 2-month double-blind crossover trial in 22 patients with newly discovered essential hypertension. The glomerular filtration rate and renal vascular resistance were unaltered: renal blood flow was slightly decreased by V. Serum Ca2+ increased and Na+ excretion declined after V. Serum lipids, glucose, and erythrocyte electrolytes were unchanged. Blood pressure (BP) was lower with E after half the maximum dosage compared with V, but similar BP reductions were obtained after 2 months with the maximum dosage.", 
    "115": "Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and splits bradykinin into inactive fragments. Inhibition of that enzyme attenuates kinin degradation and potentiates the action of kinins in many pharmacological investigations. Kinins are very potent vasodilating peptides which reduce blood pressure by lowering peripheral vascular resistance. Under experimental conditions in vitro kinins mediated a lot of metabolic and hemodynamic effects of the ACE inhibitors. However, it is still not known whether kinins also play a major role in the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors in vivo. New and highly specific assays are available to determine kinins in blood. But after ACE inhibition no homogeneous changes in circulating kinins are observed by reviewing recently published studies and even inhibition of kallikrein-kinin systems by either antibradykinin-antiserum or aprotinin does not clarify the role of kinins in the hemodynamic responses to ACE inhibition. The newly available bradykinin receptor antagonists inhibit in vitro and in vivo the effect of exogenous bradykinin. They were metabolized like kinins and in higher doses can develop kinin-like activities. After intravenous injection the bradykinin-receptor antagonists induce in vivo an increase in systemic blood pressure and thereby can reduce the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors markedly. However, it is unclear to date whether the bradykinin receptor antagonists developed their blood pressure-enhancing effect only by blocking the kinin-induced vasodilation or by some other stimulating effects on the vasopressor hormones. As long as the mechanisms of the hemodynamic action of the bradykinin antagonists are uncertain, no unequivocal interpretation of the results is possible and the role of kinins in the action of ACE inhibitors in vivo remains still uncertain.", 
    "116": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been available for about 10 years for the treatment of various forms of hypertension. Essential hypertension responds particularly well to the administration of this group of drugs, especially when combined with diuretics. A pronounced fall in blood pressure can be achieved in renovascular hypertension with high plasma renin levels; when ACE inhibitors were administered in diagnosed renal artery stenosis there was a significant rise in plasma renin activity on the affected side. Renoparenchymatous hypertension and hypertension in diabetes mellitus can also be improved by the long-term administration of ACE inhibitors, and the progression of renal failure in these disorders seems to be slowed down. Side effects such as neutropenia, exanthema, hearing disorders and pronounced hypotension with an acute deterioration in renal function are substance- and dose-dependent; regular monitoring of the patients greatly reduces their occurrence.", 
    "117": "The antihypertensive action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be related to inhibition of systemic and local vascular angiotensin-II formation, to a potentiation of the local vascular kinin system with secondary stimulation of prostacyclin synthesis, and also to their effects on the central nervous system as well as on renal hemodynamics and excretory function. More detailed studies in patients with severe hypertension, previously not adequately controlled by conventional therapy with a diuretic, a beta-blocking agent and a vasodilator dihydralazine, showed that addition of the ACE inhibitor ramipril normalized systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) without hypotensive episodes or reflex tachycardia. ACE inhibition caused a change in the baroreceptor set point as we had previously demonstrated in healthy subjects, but baroreceptor sensitivity was not affected and the pressure response to exogenous norepinephrine remained unchanged by ACE inhibition. Despite the significant reduction in BP in our patients, endogenous creatinine clearance remained unaltered. Furthermore, the decrease in BP is accompanied by an initial natriuresis probably contributing to the BP-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors. Decreased proximal tubular reabsorption may include enhanced urate clearance reflected by a decrease in serum urate concentration which we observed despite continuous diuretic treatment. ACE inhibition also prevents secondary aldosteronism and thereby avoids renal potassium loss. In our patients this resulted in a 10% decrease in urinary potassium excretion and a small rise in serum potassium concentration. Redistribution of intrarenal blood flow with increased medullary flow, in addition, will antagonize the hydroosmotic effect of vasopressin, thus resulting in a rise in free-water clearance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "118": "Converting enzyme inhibitors, alone or in combination, are a safe and effective treatment for many hypertensives. However, the range of responses varies between individual patients and it has been claimed that there are two or three phases to the response. Pretreatment plasma renin (as an indication of activation of the renin angiotensin system) and the patient's age have been claimed to predict blood pressure fall. We have investigated whether these factors are useful indications of clinical response in mild-moderate essential hypertension. We have also investigated how well the response to the first dose correlates with the response to long-term (6 weeks) treatment. In a placebo-controlled trial of enalapril (20 mg daily), the blood pressure fall was analysed using an integrated pharmacokinetic/dynamic model of the concentration-effect relationship. The relation between the active drug concentration and blood pressure fall was best described by a non-linear Langmuir (Emax) model: E = (Emax C/C50 + C), where E is the effect, C the drug concentration, Emax is the maximum blood pressure fall and C50 is the drug concentration which causes a fall in blood pressure of 50% of the maximum. For a group of 13 essential hypertensives Emax was 46/20 mm Hg and C50 77 +/- 17 ng/ml. Emax was not related to age or pretreatment renin, but was positively correlated with pretreatment blood pressure (r = 0.69; p less than 0.01). Emax after 6 weeks of treatment (48 +/- 22 and 50 +/- 20 mm Hg, respectively, r = 0.89; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "119": "The concepts that increased intracellular Ca2+ content and increased glomerular capillary pressure play an important role in the progression of chronic renal diseases has led to the suggestion that treatment with calcium-blocking agents (diltiazem; CBB) or converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril; CEI) may be indicated to prevent renal failure. We studied the effects of CCB and CEI on the early course of adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy, where glomerular pressure has been shown to be unchanged, blood pressure was only mildly elevated and renal failure incipient. Animals were studied 2, 7, 12, 16 and 20 weeks after the second injection of ADR, 2 mg/kg. In treated rats, blood pressure remained normal. At the end of the study, proteinuria and serum creatine were lower in ADR-CEI than in ADR rats (149 +/- 42 vs. 616 +/- 90 mg/day, p less than 0.01 and 0.36 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.02 mg%, p less than 0.01, respectively). ADR-CCB had values similar to those of untreated ADR rats. Mesangial expansion and focal glomerulosclerosis were present only in ADR and ADR-CCB rats, whereas in ADR-CEI rats the glomeruli were virtually normal. Glomerular 45Ca uptake was increased in ADR, decreased in ADR-CCB rats, and normal in ADR-CEI. Glomerular 6-keto PGF1 alpha and TxB2 were significantly increased in ADR rats, and both treatments decreased TxB2. The results suggest that endogenous angiotensin II is important for the early progression of glomerular injury toward renal insufficiency, while tissue Ca2+ accumulation may play an important role in more advanced phases.", 
    "120": "The treatment of glomerular proteinuria may be directed at: (1) control of basic disease processes; (2) interference with mediator systems; (3) modulation of the physiological determinants of glomerular permselectivity. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressant agents largely exert their putative beneficial effects through actions on basic processes. Agents which affect mediator systems show great promise but the multiplicity of mediators may frustrate therapeutic efforts. Altering the physiologic determinants of proteinuria, as with diet, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may be quite useful. The antiproteinuric effects of these maneuvers may not only reduce the impact of proteinuria per se but also retard the rate of progression of renal failure which so frequently accompanies many of the states of abnormal glomerular proteinuria.", 
    "121": "The role of angiotensin II (AII) in Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) production following furosemide has been examined in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Furosemide 20 mg was injected intravenously in eight hypertensive subjects already treated with oral captopril 25 mg or a matching placebo. Urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (a metabolite of PGI2) and PGE2, PRA and AII was increased following furosemide without captopril pretreatment. The rises in urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2, and plasma AII after furosemide were prevented by the captopril pretreatment. Urinary volume, sodium and furosemide were not affected by captopril. The data indicate that the effect of furosemide on PGI2 production, as reflected by the urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, was mediated by an action of AII.", 
    "122": "There is evidence that protein kinase C activity in platelets from adult SHR is significantly higher than this activity in age-matched WKY. In the present study, protein kinase C activity in the SHR was measured following antihypertensive drug treatment. Chronic administration of enalapril to SHR for 2 weeks decreased both systolic blood pressure and protein kinase C activity to the levels seen in the WKY. Similar results were obtained in case of chronic treatment of SHR with hydralazine or nifedipine. These results suggest that enhanced protein kinase C activity of SHR can be suppressed by lowering blood pressure by antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "123": "The pathogenesis of heart failure is not yet fully understood. In animal models there is some evidence to suggest a role for free radicals (FRs). We have investigated malondialdehyde - LM in plasma of patients with heart failure and found it to be raised when compared to controls. We present data to show that Captopril, a drug with an ACE inhibitory effect is a FR scavenger both in vitro and ex-vivo in patients with heart failure.", 
    "124": "We report a case of a 75 year-old male who committed suicide by taking an overdose of captopril. He took approximately ninety 12.5 mg captopril tablets. The postmortem plasma concentration of captopril was 60.4 mg/L. A review of the medical literature revealed five cases of captopril overdose all from unsuccessful suicide attempts. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of fatal captopril overdose with the measurement of plasma concentration of the drug.", 
    "125": "ACE-inhibitors have many positive features, when treating patients with progressive renal failure. These patients have high mortality in cardiac and vascular complications. It is therefore important to treat hypertension in these patients with drugs which do not have negative effects on lipid-, glucose, or electrolyte-metabolism, and ACE inhibition fulfills these requirements. These drugs decrease left ventricular hypertrophy, which is a positive prognostic sign of hypertensive patients, too. Contrary to regular diuretics, ACE-inhibition does not cause the negative effects associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system. In many patients ACE-inhibitors decrease proteinuria to a higher degree than other antihypertensive drugs, and this may be an important clinical advantage, particularly in nephrotic patients. ACE inhibition might slow progressive renal failure. This effect may be associated with advantageous intraglomerular hemodynamic changes, but may also associate with inhibition of negative effects of angiotensin II on mesangial hypertrophy and matrix proliferation.", 
    "126": "Cardiac insufficiency is a clinical syndrome which presents several distinctive findings but is nevertheless difficult to define both clinically and in the scientific literature. In this article we maintain that cardiac insufficiency is a clinical condition characterized by symptomatic fluid retention on a cardiac basis, combined with signs of impaired pumping in the form of reduced capacity and/or other organic effects such as reduced renal function. The renin-angiotensin system is of cardinal importance once cardiac insufficiency is established and ACE inhibition is of essential significance for the treatment. It is not yet clear whether it is possible to prevent the onset of cardiac insufficiency in patients at high risk thereof. Current studies may answer this question.", 
    "127": "Angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) comprise a relatively new group of potent antihypertensives. They are today among the most used preparations for reducing blood pressure. ACE inhibitors may be used for treatment of almost all forms and degrees of hypertension. By reason of the reduction of the resistance in the peripheral vessels the blood pressure drops by 12-20 per cent, both at rest and during muscular effort, without diminution of the heart's pump function. The autonomic reflexes are unchanged and the circulation in the kidneys and the brain is retained. ACE inhibition does not result in fluid retention. In adequate doses the drugs are tolerated and give few side-effects provided that the patient is not dehydrated.", 
    "128": "In the percent study the authors have demonstrated that the peripheral blood flow and resistance as measured by strain-gauge venous occlusion plethysmography were favourably altered by enalapril. The peripheral blood flow increased significantly and since there was no detectable change in ankle pressure this indicated a decrease in resistance during administration of the drug.", 
    "129": "Eighteen patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension and nephropathy were randomized to receive captopril or enalapril for 6 months. Two patients with serum creatinine of greater than 400 mumol/l had to be excluded from the study because of rapidly deteriorating renal function after starting treatment. Of the remaining patients, 7 received captopril and 9 received enalapril. Blood pressure control was achieved in about 50% of patients with either drug alone. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance were unchanged in both groups but there was a greater tendency for the former to increase in patients with higher pretreatment values. Proteinuria was reduced at 1 month only in the enalapril group which also showed a significant elevation of serum potassium after treatment. Captopril and enalapril have only a modest antihypertensive action in patients with NIDDM and nephropathy. Their use in patients with renal insufficiency must be balanced against the risk of further aggravating the deterioration of renal function.", 
    "130": "Ten patients with severe pulmonary hypertension due to Toxic Oil Syndrome underwent cardiac catheterization to analyse the acute effect of intrapulmonary injection of 1.25 mg of enalaprilat. Haemodynamic parameters were obtained at basal state, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after administration of the drug. Enalaprillat did not produce any statistically significant changes in pulmonary pressures and resistances or cardiac output. This lack of response is unknown but may be related to the presence of endothelial damage and fixed pulmonary vascular lesions observed at autopsy in three patients.", 
    "131": "Global cerebral ischemia (four vessel model) was induced in renovascular hypertensive rats (two kidney, one clip model) chronically treated with intraperitoneal administration of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors, either captopril (100 mg/kg per day) or Wy-44,655 (10 mg/kg per day). Mortality following cerebral ischemia was higher in renovascular hypertensive rats than in normotensive controls. Reduction of blood pressure with captopril or Wy-44,655, lowered mortality. In surviving renovascular hypertensive and normotensive rats cerebral ischemia induced hyperactivity and lesions of the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Prolonged treatment with captopril--but not with Wy-44,655--reduced hyperactivity and the extent of the CA1 lesions. In conclusion, hypertension increases mortality following cerebral ischemia but does not affect the extent of brain injury in survivors. Prior treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors lowers mortality. Treatment with captopril attenuates brain injury in survivors.", 
    "132": "Two mechanisms have been proposed for the pathogenesis of eruptions induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: (1) an allergic, immune-mediated reaction and (2) a pharmacologic, dose-dependent response. Two cases of palmoplantar psoriasis are presented, which can be attributed to the induction (case 1) and exacerbation (case 2) of ACE inhibitors. The first patient developed his eruption 2 months after he had received captopril, probably as a result of an allergic immunologic mechanism. This has been based mainly on circumstantial evidence and is further strengthened by the positive result of the mast cell degranulation test. The second patient developed an atenolol-induced, mild plantar psoriasis. She experienced a dramatic flare-up of her psoriatic lesions shortly after she had received an ACE inhibitor. It is suggested that her reaction occurred as a result of the enalapril-induced augmentation of kinin levels in the skin. These 2 patients represent deductive and unusual examples of the two different mechanisms that are responsible for the cutaneous complications of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "133": "Early antihypertensive intervention in diabetes often means intervention in a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors including glucose intolerance per se, hyperlipidemia, obesity and hypertension, which are not just coexistent but may be causally linked together by the resistance of peripheral tissues to the action of insulin. Blood pressure lowering treatment should therefore be metabolically neutral in order to avoid aggravation of this risk factor syndrome. Clinical studies applying CE-inhibitors in type II diabetes are critically reviewed under this aspect. The majority of the available studies in type II diabetes report a reduction of insulin resistance and a marginal improvement of metabolic control. The order of magnitude in HbA1 reduction is nearly 10% of the glycosylated haemoglobin, reduction of fasting and postprandial blood glucose approximates 1 mmol/l. From a more extended view, considering essential hypertension as insulin resistant and thus possibly \"prediabetic\" state, this marginal metabolic effect gets further support from recent studies in essential hypertension consistently reporting an improvement of metabolic parameters of similar magnitude. This might become a central argument in the discussion about individualized and metabolically neutral antihypertensive treatment in essential hypertension.", 
    "134": "ACE inhibition is widely used for treatment of arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure. No change occurs in glucose metabolism either in diabetic or non diabetic subjects. No change occurs in glucose metabolism in patients with chronic renal failure. Glucose intolerance induced by diuretics is attenuated when ACE inhibitor is associated with thiazides. In some very rare circumstances (with high plasmatic levels of norepinephrine), insulin sensitivity seems to be enhanced by captopril. Then, in clinical use, no adverse effect occurs with ACE inhibition in non diabetic or diabetic subjects. Under thiazide treatment, ACE inhibitors protect against glucose intolerance.", 
    "135": "Diabetic nephropathy leading to end stage renal failure with 30 to 40% cumulative incidence remains one of the great life threatening dangers for type I diabetics. Its natural history gets its impact due to the biochemical sequela of diabetic hyperglycemia such as polyol accumulation or glycation processes. Functional changes may be detected by microalbuminuria which in turn is followed by intraglomerular, intrarenal and finally systemic hypertension. Hypertension itself seems to be part of the self perpetuating process, and therefore antihypertensive treatment has been shown to be an effective area. Antihypertensive treatment by itself is effective in the slowing down of the decline of glomerular filtration rate, together with decreasing the amount of albumin excretion and, therefore, might be expected to be of value in prolonging the renal prognosis over a length of time. From the theoretical point of view the ACE inhibitors were looked upon as beneficial and therefore preferable as interventional tools because of their special effects of blood pressure redistribution within the glomeruli. Long term reports and a lot of short and intermediate term controlled studies were able to confirm the expected effects. Whether this is the case also in borderline hypertension or even in normotensive diabetics remains finally to be established. The question of long term effects such as survival rates and the superiority of antihypertensive treatments with beta blockers or drug combinations, or whether these results reflect merely their systemic blood pressure lowering effects remain finally to be elucidated.", 
    "136": "Since vascular resistance is elevated in hypertension, it is suggested that vasodilators lower the blood pressure by a physiologic mechanism and therefore must be more useful than cardiac output-lowering drugs. This is not entirely correct. Drugs that lower cardiac output are also relative vasodilators, but the vasodilation occurs at a lower level of cardiac output. It is also not necessarily true that all vasodilators are good antihypertensive agents. The clinical profile of a vasodilator depends on its effect on the venous return, cardiac output, regional blood flow, renin-angiotensin system, and sympathetic reflexes. From the viewpoint of hemodynamics, an ideal antihypertensive drug is a vasodilator that does not excessively increase cardiac output, causes no fluid retention, does not induce a great deal of venodilation, and does not elicit substantial neurohumoral counterregulation. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, some calcium antagonists, and some combined alpha/beta-blocking agents come close to satisfying the hemodynamic definition of an ideal antihypertensive drug.", 
    "137": "The lack of kinin formation in systemic circulation and in the renal system may lead to the pathogenesis of high blood pressure (hypertension). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are able to protect the kinin inactivation by kininase II, therefore, causing an accumulation of kinin. Although the concentrations of kinin in plasma after oral administration of ACE inhibitors are conflicting this is mainly due to methodological difficulties. Kinin receptor antagonists are becoming most reliable pharmacological probes for defining the molecular actions of kinin in several physiopathological states, and in the mechanism of actions of drugs which are dependent on the kinin system. The blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibitors can be antagonized by the pretreatment with kinin receptor antagonists. I have therefore proposed that the hypotensive action of ACE inhibitors may reflect the activation of kinin receptor. It is suggested that the development of compounds having protective properties on the kallikrein-kinin system might be therapeutically applicable as anti-hypertensive drugs.", 
    "138": "From the discussion of these questions, several conclusions seem firm, whereas other issues await resolution. Patients with severe CHF should be treated with diuretics, digoxin, and an ACE inhibitor. In mild and moderate CHF, a diuretic should be combined with either digoxin or an ACE inhibitor--usually the latter. However, most of these patients would benefit from receiving all three drugs. Patients with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction are at jeopardy for progressive deterioration. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and, possibly, direct vasodilators may prevent progression. In initiating vasodilator therapy, ACE inhibitors usually should be the agent of choice. Exceptions may be patients with ongoing ischemia in whom nitrates are an appropriate alternative and those who are poor candidates because of hypotension, renal insufficiency, or hyperkalemia.", 
    "139": "The observations of a 16-week Tensiomin therapy of 10 hypertensive patients treated with hemodialysis have been discussed. The patients have been treated for about 5 years with hemodialysis, suffered from anuria and required besides systhematical ultrafiltration a combination antihypertensive therapy. Tensiomin was combined with Minipress, Trasicor, Depressan, Estulic and Corinfar by using three- or four-drug combinations. In the course of the administration of Tensiomin the doses of the other antihypertensive drugs could be decreased by 50% on average, while the blood pressure of the patients was normalized. By controlling the patients on weeks 1, 4, 12 and 16 of therapy toxic side-effects or notable pathological changes of the examined laboratory parameters (WBC, serum total protein, Na, K, Ca, P, bilirubin, blood sugar and SGOT values) were not seen. It has been concluded that Tensiomin is an effective drug in combination therapy applied for normalizing the hypertension of dialysed patients.", 
    "140": "The effects of single oral doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril (CI-906) 40 mg and the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol 100 mg on sympathetic and parasympathetic function and on exercise capacity have been studied in 8 healthy young men. The trial followed a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized cross-over design, with at least one week between treatments. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) at rest were slightly reduced by atenolol but were not affected by quinapril. Atenolol impaired the sympathetically mediated increases in HR and BP caused by standing, immersion of the hand into melting ice, the Valsalva manoeuvre and isometric forearm exercise. Quinapril did not influence those responses nor the vagally mediated bradycardia of the diving reflex. Atenolol, however, augmented the vagal bradycardia, presumably by sympathetic inhibition. In a dynamic bicycle ergometer test with a stepwise increasing work load, exercise performance was decreased by atenolol but not by quinapril. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by quinapril was shown by a marked decrease in serum ACE activity and a several-fold increase in plasma renin activity (PRA). Atenolol produced a moderate reduction in PRA. Before or during exercise, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline were not influenced by either drug. The results indicate that, unlike the atenolol-induced beta-adrenoceptor blockade, ACE inhibition by a single dose of quinapril had no clear effect on autonomic nervous function or exercise capacity.", 
    "141": "The inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by kinins was studied using bradykinin (BK), lysyl-bradykinin (Lys-BK), [Hydroxyproline3]-bradykinin ([Hyp3]-BK) and [Hydroxyproline3]-lysyl-bradykinin ([Hyp3]-Lys-BK). The latter two are novel kinins recently identified in our laboratory. All the four kinins displayed competitive inhibition on the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by purified canine lung ACE. Inhibition constants (Ki) for the four kinins were estimated from Dixon's plot as follows-BK: 0.27 microM, Lys-BK: 0.57 microM, [Hyp3]-BK: 0.34 microM, and [Hyp3]-Lys-BK: 0.27 microM. In the rat hindlimb perfusion system, the kinins were demonstrated to partially inhibit angiotensin I conversion to angiotensin II by the vascular ACE. Taken together, these results suggest that angiotensin II formation by ACE in the vascular tissue is possibly inhibited by local kinins, especially after ACE inhibitor administration. This indirect action of kinins, coupled with its direct vasodilatory action, might indicate a cooperative participation in vasodilation.", 
    "142": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) affects approximately 400,000 new patients each year in the United States, resulting in death in more than 50% within five years, with traditional therapy including digitalis and diuretics. The aging of the population will only serve to aggravate this problem. Surgical treatment of CHF is a viable option in a minority of cases; a total of no more than 2,000 heart transplantation procedures were performed in the United States in 1988. Therefore, if survival is to improve in patients with CHF, effective alternative medical therapy may need to be added to or substituted for more traditional therapy. Vasodilator therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril, or the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate, improves survival in patients with severe heart failure when added to treatment with digitalis and diuretics. Nevertheless, the mortality rate remains extremely high once this stage of the disease process is reached. The prevention of left ventricular dilatation and remodeling, before the occurrence of overt heart failure, is the focus of much attention. Interventions that limit or interrupt the disease process at an even earlier stage will be necessary to make a major impact on survival.", 
    "143": "High blood pressure occurs in many pregnant diabetic patients (30 to 40 p cent), and it is associated with significant impairement of fetal prognosis. Hypertension is no doubt a marker of the vascular diabetic disease, which obviates an adequate placentation. Proper antihypertensive management is necessary in those patients, but its prognostic importance is far less than is that of a perfect glycemic control. Antihypertensive therapy differs in some aspects from what is should be in non-pregnant patients: first, compounds such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or calcium-channel blockers are not considered safe in pregnant women, whereas they are the first choice in non-pregnant diabetics. Second, over-control of blood pressure is very harmful to fetal growth, and should be carefully avoided. Finally, present literature lacks proper controlled studies, which could help in designing the best antihypertensive therapeutic strategy in pregnant diabetic patients.", 
    "144": "The purpose of this study was to measure components of the renin angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, with and without nephropathy, to study the renal sensitivity to angiotensin II in uncomplicated type 1 diabetes and to investigate the short and long-term renal effects of angiotensin II reduction with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In patients with type 1 diabetes without complications, plasma renin activity, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were normal. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, renin levels were elevated, probably partly as a result of diuretic treatment. However, renin levels were also elevated compared to patients with other renal diseases who had similar treatment and degree of azotemia. The renal sensitivity to angiotensin II was normal in patients with uncomplicated diabetes. The reduction in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow and increases in filtration fraction during A II infusion were equal to those in healthy controls. Nine days' captopril treatment in 15 patients with diabetic nephropathy induced an increase in renal plasma flow and a decrease in filtration fraction. The glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged. During 8 weeks' randomised enalapril or metoprolol treatment in 40 patients with diabetic nephropathy, enalapril treatment reduced proteinuria to half the initial value. Metoprolol treatment had no effect on proteinuria. Furosemide was also used and the dosage was adjusted to give equally effective blood-pressure control in both groups. During long-term treatment with captopril in patients with diabetic nephropathy, the rate of decline in kidney function over time was reduced to one-fourth the initial value even though the blood pressure was only slightly reduced. The renin angiotensin system appears to be functionally intact in diabetes mellitus and interruption by ACE inhibition reduces proteinuria both by blood pressure reduction and by an effect independent of systemic blood pressure. Long-term treatment might protect kidney function in diabetic nephropathy to a greater extent than would be expected from the blood-pressure-lowering effect alone.", 
    "145": "A 13-year-old girl presented with lassitude, polyuria and hypokalemia. Plasma renin concentration and urinary prostaglandin excretion were elevated, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration, urinary aldosterone excretion and blood pressure were normal. A diagnosis of Bartter's syndrome was made. The result of treatment with oral potassium was unsatisfactory. Treatment with acetylsalicylic acid had some effect, but an allergic reaction rendered withdrawal necessary. Treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and oral potassium led to clinical and biochemical improvement.", 
    "146": "The CONSENSUS trial, which compared the effects of enalapril and placebo on survival in severe heart failure, had a limited blinded treatment period. Follow-up for 8.5 months from the end of blinded therapy was performed. Enalapril therapy was encouraged in all patients during follow-up. Of the 135 surviving patients, 58 had previously been allocated placebo and 77 had been allocated enalapril. The follow-up mortality rates in those receiving enalapril were 18 (31%) and 16 (21%), respectively. Mortality was markedly lower in patients treated with enalapril than in those not started on the drug (16% vs 61%). The follow-up data strongly support the original CONSENSUS data regarding reduction of mortality in severe heart failure after the addition of enalapril.", 
    "147": "Treatment for patients with congestive heart failure is primarily directed at reducing symptoms and improving functional capacity. In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, therapeutic interventions incorporating diuretics, digoxin and selected vasodilators, specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, are designed to correct pathophysiological mechanisms such as left ventricular dysfunction, excessive vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium and water. Physician-investigators are turning their attention to identifying and treating patients early in the course of their disease. Vasodilator therapy in patients with mild symptoms of heart failure may not only improve exercise performance, but also reduce mortality. In addition, recent studies have suggested that ACE inhibitors may prevent progression of disease in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It is hoped that ongoing research will demonstrate that early identification and treatment of these patients may prevent development of symptoms and improve survival.", 
    "148": "The objectives of treatment for patients with chronic heart failure are the prevention of the initial occurrence, the alleviation of signs and symptoms, the delay of the progression of damage to heart muscle and the reduction of the mortality rate. Many drugs are used in severe heart failure. Current controversy is concerned with which drugs to use in patients with mild heart failure or with left ventricular dysfunction. There is a trend towards the earlier introduction of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor combined with a diuretic.", 
    "149": "Forty patients of elderly and senile ages with chronic obstructive bronchitis, complicated with degrees II-III respiratory insufficiency, and chronic cor pulmonale with stage IIA circulatory failure have been examined. The examination revealed impairment of the external respiration and tissue oxygen exchange, changes in the cardio- and hemodynamics the most typical of which was a significant rise of the diastolic volume of the left ventricle, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and an increase of the extracellular volume of fluid. To explore the ways to correct these changes, nine patients were given a single dose of capoten, an inhibitor of the converting enzyme angiotensin (12.5 mg orally), after which a 20-day course was administered (12.5 mg three times daily). The agent proved to be highly effective, which suggested the expediency of its use in the complex management of old-age patients with decompensated cor pulmonale.", 
    "150": "This case was a 51-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis at some clinic and had been treated with both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroid 3 years before visiting our clinic. When she noticed a decrease in visual acuity and general fatigue in June 1985, she was referred to an ophthalmologist of our hospital, and found to have blood pressure of 240/150 mmHg and KW grade IV retinal findings. She was admitted in our department to examine and treat malignant hypertension. On admission, remarkable hypergammaglobulinemia (29.3%), arthralgia, arthral deformity and pericardial effusion were present thus, she was suspected to be suffering from malignant rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-nuclear antibody (64X), anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibody (64X) and anti-RNase sensitive antibody of anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) antibody (81920X) were positive, while anti-RNase resistant antibody of anti-ENA antibody was negative. Immunologically, her condition was consistent with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Since urinary protein was positive and creatinine clearance was 46.0 ml/min, renal function was thought to be diminished. Her chest roentgenogram revealed cardiomegaly (CTR 67.5%) and an increase in pulmonary vascular shadow. An echocardiogram demonstrated the presence of pericardial effusion. Plasma renin activity was 3.3 ng/ml/h and it was suspected that an intrarenal ischemic change resulted in increased renin release from the juxta-glomerular apparatus, leading to the marked hypertension. Treatment was started with prednisolone 60 mg/day during 4 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "151": "The long-term antihypertensive effects of enalapril were assessed for a period of up to 1 year in 44 elderly patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo period, patients who were assigned to enalapril were followed for 6 weeks in a randomized clinical trial. In patients who benefited from enalapril, treatment was continued and subjects were followed for up to 1 year. Supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced throughout the 1-year period compared with baseline. The dosage of enalapril was increased from 10 to 20 mg daily in 12 patients; 8 required additional antihypertensive agents. Enalapril is effective in the long-term treatment of hypertension; no loss of antihypertensive agents. Enalapril is effective in the long-term treatment of hypertension; no loss of antihypertensive effect occurs.", 
    "152": "The antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril and its effects on renal function and glucose homeostasis were investigated in 9 hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Enalapril therapy produced a significant fall in blood pressure (BP) (p less than 0.05) and a significant increase in renal blood flow (p less than 0.05) without a change in glomerular filtration rate. Furthermore, fasting plasma glucose was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01). Similarly, M value, as an index of plasma glucose control in diabetes, was significantly reduced from 19.6 to 10.1 (p less than 0.01). These findings suggested that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was effective in reducing BP and improving renal function, and might improve glucose homeostasis in hypertensive diabetics.", 
    "153": "The extent and duration of the antihypertensive effect of enalapril and captopril, both given once daily, were evaluated in 12 mild-to-moderate essential hypertensives by 24-hour noninvasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring (Pressurometer IV-mod 1990-1991, Del Mar Avionics). Patients were randomized to a cross-over regimen either with enalapril, 10-20 mg, followed by captopril, 50-100 mg (first group), or with captopril followed by enalapril (second group). The dose was doubled if, at week 3 of each treatment, the diastolic BP remained at 90 mm Hg. Doubling of the 2 drugs was not required in 4 patients; in 7 patients the dose of both drugs was doubled; and in 1 patient the dose of only captopril was doubled. Two of the 7 patients who required doubling of both drugs were considered nonresponders to enalapril and captopril. The circadian rhythm was not altered by the treatments, and the drugs reduced BP mainly during the waking hours. However, the second peak of systolic BP in the late afternoon did not graphically appear to be modified by captopril administration. A periodic asymmetric model with 3 harmonics analysis carried out on 24-hour BP data justifies only the use of enalapril for once-daily administration.", 
    "154": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory therapy is widely used to treat hypertension. With long-term use, it is now being shown to have a beneficial effect on renal function and proteinuria in patients with renal insufficiency. When hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency are treated with enalapril, glomerular filtration rate is maintained, effective renal plasma flow is increased, and microalbuminuria and gross proteinuria are reduced. These beneficial renal changes with enalapril therapy differ from those of most other conventional antihypertensive medications. Clinical awareness of potential problems with hyperkalemia and increasing azotemia, particularly in the setting of salt/volume depletion, is important to assure optimal patient management. When these problems occur, they are nearly always reversible by correcting salt/volume status and/or interrupting enalapril therapy.", 
    "155": "Many traditional antihypertensive drugs are linked to various effects that may cause concern in the hypertensive diabetic patient. The favorable tolerability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in essential hypertension makes it likely that they will be well tolerated when used in diabetic patients. Data from ongoing studies support the theory that ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure to the same extent in hypertensive diabetics as in patients with essential hypertension. ACE inhibitors do not seem to affect glucose homeostasis adversely; they may even improve glucose tolerance to a small degree. The renal effects of ACE inhibitors in animal experiments suggest a renal-protective effect that can make them especially valuable.", 
    "156": "The urinary zinc/creatinine ratio has been measured in five groups of patients with essential hypertension and in a group of healthy controls. The first four groups of patients consisted of subjects being treated for at least three months with captopril alone, hydrochlorothiazide alone, captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide, or captopril and furosemide. The fifth group comprised hypertensive patients not on any medication. The first four patient groups exhibited significantly increased urinary zinc/creatinine ratios when compared to the control and untreated hypertensive groups, but in the two combination regimens there was little zincuria. It is suggested that both diuretics inactivate the zincuric effect of captopril by binding to its sulphydryl group within the tubular lumen.", 
    "157": "The efficacy and safety of enalapril and its effects on the quality of life were evaluated in 1017 Puerto Rican patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension. Enalapril was administered for 4 weeks in an open label, noncomparative study. Initially, patients received enalapril 5 mg and the dosage was titrated upwards, according to response, to a maximum of 20 mg/day. The goal of therapy was to achieve a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than 90 mm Hg. The study included 468 male and 545 female patients (mean age 52.6 +/- 11.9 years). A subgroup of 294 elderly patients was also evaluated (mean age 65.9 +/- 6.1 years). Mean blood pressure decreased from 157/99 mm Hg to 138/84 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001) in 966 patients who received enalapril as monotherapy. Mean blood pressure decreased from 164/99 mm Hg to 143/85 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001) in the elderly patients. After 4 weeks of enalapril monotherapy, 67% of the patients had a DBP less than 90 mm Hg. Enalapril was very well tolerated. Headache and dizziness were the most frequently reported side effects. Among the patients who completed a quality of life questionnaire, more than 70% reported feeling the same or better and less than 2% reported feeling worse after enalapril therapy. In conclusion, enalapril seems to be an excellent alternative as initial therapy in young and elderly Puerto Rican hypertensive patients.", 
    "158": "The long acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was compared with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine as sustained-release formulation in 136 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. This multicentre study was carried out in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion by 28 cardiologists in private practice. After a 2-week placebo period, patients were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups; the first group received enalapril 20 mg daily (n = 68), and the second group received sustained-release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily (n = 68). The duration of treatment was 12 weeks. In both groups, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg was added at week 4 if diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 90 mm Hg. At week 8, if the target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg was not achieved, the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide was increased to 50mg. The clinical characteristics of the patients in each group were comparable. After 4 weeks of treatment, the reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure was similar in both groups (12.1 mm Hg in the enalapril group vs 10.3 mm Hg in the nifedipine group). Moreover, although the difference between the groups was more noticeable after 12 weeks of treatment (16.3 vs 13.9 mm Hg, respectively), it did not reach significance. The number of patients experiencing clinical adverse effects was significantly greater in the nifedipine group than in the enalapril group [33 (48.5%) vs 18 (26.5%), respectively]. The most common complaints of patients administered nifedipine included swollen ankles, flushing and headaches, whereas complaints in the enalapril group included cough, asthenia, and epigastralgia. Three patients were withdrawn from the study because of side effects in the enalapril group and 10 were withdrawn from the nifedipine group. These results indicate that enalapril and sustained-release nifedipine are equally effective in controlling mild to moderate hypertension. However, enalapril was much better tolerated in this study.", 
    "159": "Pathophysiological mechanisms of pressure elevation are different in the elderly hypertensive patient than in middle-aged or young patients. The elderly patient is characterised by a decrease in cardiac output, renal blood flow, and intravascular volume and an increase in total peripheral resistance and vascular resistance. Elderly patients also, quite often, have target organ disease such as left ventricular hypertrophy and nephrosclerosis. Because of impaired baroreflexes and latent or overt cerebrovascular disease, the elderly patient is particularly susceptible to abrupt falls in arterial pressure. Clearly, these physiological findings have to be taken into account when prescribing antihypertensive therapy. Calcium channel blockers and converting enzyme inhibitors seem to be particularly useful in the geriatric population. A close match between the underlying pathophysiology of pressure elevation in a given patient and the pharmacological effects of a selected antihypertensive drug will provide more rational and convenient control of arterial pressure in our senior citizens.", 
    "160": "When choosing antihypertensive agents for the treatment of diabetic patients with hypertension, it is necessary to consider the individual characteristics of these patients. In this respect, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors constitute an attractive option for diabetic patients. The effects of enalapril alone for 16 weeks in 23 non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDD) patients and in 10 non-diabetic patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH) [diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg and less than 115 mm Hg] were evaluated. Similar reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed in 17 NIDD patients (from 155 +/- 18/100 +/-11 mm Hg to 128 +/- 12/82 +/- 8 mm Hg, respectively) and in 6 EH patients (from 155 +/- 21/100 +/- 6 mm Hg to 125 +/- 20/84 +/- 8 mm Hg, respectively) who achieved and maintained blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) for 16 weeks. In 4 NIDD and 4 EH patients blood pressure was not controlled. Two NIDD patients discontinued the medication, one because of symptomatic postural hypotension and the other, who had a plasma creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dl, because of hyperkalaemia (K = 6.1 mEq/L). In the responders, enalapril did not alter glucose tolerance, plasma or urinary excretion of creatinine, potassium, sodium and aldosterone. Plasma renin activity increased in the NIDD group only. In 11 patients (6 NIDD and 5 EH), the elevated protein or albumin excretions decreased. It is concluded that enalapril is a good therapeutic option for NIDD patients with hypertension.", 
    "161": "In contrast to some other antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower glomerular capillary pressure, decrease proteinuria, and may halt progressive glomerular injury and loss of renal function in experimental chronic renal failure (CRF). Although these favourable effects of ACE inhibition may result from alterations in glomerular haemodynamics, there is some evidence to show that ACE inhibitors may reduce glomerular injury through other mechanisms. CRF in man may result from a variety of insults to the kidney. However, it is not known whether, or under which conditions, glomerular capillary pressure is elevated in this heterogeneous population. Limited data suggest that renal haemodynamics (and perhaps glomerular capillary pressure) may depend in part on the level of systemic blood pressure. In addition, several studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between systemic blood pressure and the rate of progression of CRF. ACE inhibitor therapy generally lowers systemic blood pressure, does not alter renal function and decreases proteinuria in patients with CRF. The reduction in proteinuria appears to be variable and may depend on pretreatment glomerular haemodynamics and/or the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Preliminary evidence also suggests that ACE inhibitors may slow the progression of renal disease in humans with CRF. However, this effect, like the reduction in proteinuria, has not been observed consistently in all patients. In addition, it is not clear whether these effects on proteinuria and progression of disease are unique to ACE inhibitor therapy, since the lowering of systemic blood pressure with other drugs may have similar effects. The heterogeneity of the response to ACE inhibition suggests that there may be interpatient differences in glomerular haemodynamics in CRF, perhaps related to systemic blood pressure or the underlying disease process. Studies to date indicate that ACE inhibitors exert their beneficial effect by lowering glomerular capillary pressure and that not all patients will benefit from therapy with regard to proteinuria or amelioration of disease progression. However, further investigation of the haemodynamic and non-haemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors, as well as the variability of response, may ultimately allow the selection of those patients who would benefit from such therapy.", 
    "162": "Aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of sublingual captopril (SLC) versus sublingual nifedipine (SLN) in treating hypertensive emergencies. During hypertensive crises (systolic blood pressure exceeding 200 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure exceeding 115 mmHg) forty hypertensive patients received either 25 mg of SLC or 10 mg of SLN in a randomized single blind fashion. Blood pressure and heart rate were then controlled after 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120 min. and, in 18 cases, up to the 8th hour from the administration. Our results showed: 1) a satisfactory control of the hypertensive crises in 80% of patients treated with SLC with a significant blood pressure reduction after 10 min. (13/8 mmHg, p less than 0.02), while the maximum hypotensive effect was achieved after 30 min. (52/36 mmHg, p less than 0.001); SLN was able to reduce blood pressure in 90% of all the cases, with a significant reduction after 5 min. (15/11 mmHg, p less than 0.02) and hypotensive peak after 20 min (57/38 mmHg, p greater than 0.001); 2) no significant differences for hypotensive effectiveness between the two groups, but with SLC having a mildly delayed onset of action when compared to SLN; 3) antihypertensive effect lasting for about 6 hours in patients treated with SLC and blood pressure progressively raising after 4 hours in patients who received SLN; 4) a significant correlation between blood pressure reduction and blood pressure before drug administration in both groups; a significant correlation between pretreatment PRA and antihypertensive effect in the SLC group. We conclude that both drugs are effective and useful in treating hypertensive emergencies. Anyway we think that in severe forms SLN should be preferred for the shorter time preceding onset of action.", 
    "163": "Since hypertension may compromise the ability to withstand hypernatremic dehydration, we investigated the impact of two experimental models of hypertension and pharmacologic normalization of blood pressure on the tolerance to chronic hypernatremic dehydration. In DOCA-salt hypertensive animals and the spontaneously-hypertensive rat (SHR), there was increased mortality and cerebral cell shrinkage during hypernatremic dehydration, compared to control Sprague-Dawley or Wistar-Kyoto rats. These findings were paralleled by significant differences in the brain intracellular water compartment size (ml/100 g dry weight), i.e. 233 +/- 6, Sprague-Dawley vs 189 +/- 8, DOCA-salt, P less than 0.01; 246 +/- 3, Wistar-Kyoto vs 194 +/- 6, SHR, P less than 0.01. Normalization of the blood pressure in the SHR with captopril restored 48% of the cerebral cell volume regulatory capacity observed in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. We conclude that sustained hypertension increases the risk of hypernatremic dehydration in select circumstances. Correction of the elevated blood pressure promotes partial recovery of normal cerebral cell volume regulation.", 
    "164": "By titrating 5 mg of native venom with aliquots of a 2 x 10(-2) M iodine monochloride solution, neutralization of lethality by the incorporation of iodine was found with 200 +/- 5 microliters of solution, and above, up to 310 +/- 10 microliters, when saturation with iodine was attained. Doses up to 1500 micrograms (equivalent to 32 LD50 of native venom), where injected i.p. in mice without lethal effects. Proteolytic, phospholipase A2 and esterolytic activities were greatly reduced, but a low activity persisted even in fully iodinated samples. Direct hemolysis was markedly inhibited, and incapacity to coagulate fibrinogen and horse plasma was also observed in the iodinated samples. Hemorrhage and necrosis in rat skin, caused by 20 micrograms of iodinated venom were not elicited by doses up to 120 micrograms of iodinated anavenom. In mice, the myonecrosis that resulted from direct i.m. injection of native venom, and the massive hemorrhage caused by 5 LD50 doses injected i.p. were abolished by venom iodination. Blood congestion in liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs, almost disappeared with iodination to the level of neutralization, and was barely seen with venom samples iodinated to saturation. The clinical signs of impaired physical activity, appearing in mice injected with 700 to 1500 micrograms of the iodinated anavenom were intensified by captopril and attenuated by epinephrine.", 
    "165": "We report the preparation of a series of eight L-alanyl-L-proline derivatives and four L-proline derivatives. Their pharmacological activity as antihypertensive agents was examined with reference to changes in the contractile response to angiotensin I (AI), bradykinine (BK) and angiotensin II (AII). Compounds 1g, 1h and 2c were the most powerful when compared with known angiotensin-converting inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril, and were selected for further pharmacological study.", 
    "166": "A rapid, accurate and reproducible method for the potentiometric determination of captopril in aqueous solution, is described. The method is based on the reaction of the thiol and the carboxylic group of captopril with silver ions whereby an equivalent amount of the acid is liberated; thereafter, the amount of captopril is determined by the potentiometric titration with sodium hydroxide. This method can be applied also for direct determination of captopril content in tablets.", 
    "167": "We studied the effects of perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor administered during 12 months, on creatinine clearance, albuminuria and glycaemic control in diabetic subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. After 1 month placebo, 40 insulin-treated patients were divided into 3 groups based upon their urinary albumin excretion rate (AER). Group I had a normoalbuminuria (AER less than 15 mg/24 h), group II had a microalbuminuria (AER : 15-150 mg/24 h) and group III had a macroproteinuria (AER greater than 150 mg/24 h and Albustix (+)). They were given perindopril, 4 to 8 mg orally once daily, and received a stable diet. Diastolic blood pressure was normalized within the first 3 months in 80% of the patients. From these, 28 (14.7 and 7 from groups I, II and III respectively) were followed during a total active treatment period of 12 months. They were matched for age, duration of diabetes and hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, daily insulin dose, postprandial plasma C-peptide and quality of glycaemic control. Mean supine diastolic blood pressure was decreased by 15 and 18% at 1 and 12 months respectively. Heart rate was not significantly modified. At 3 months, plasma ACE activity was nearly totally inhibited while plasma renin activity was markedly increased. In patients of group II, microalbuminuria was reduced from 66 +/- 13 (mean +/- SEM after placebo) to 39 +/- 6 mg/24 h after 1 month perindopril and this effect was maintained at 12 months. In group I, albuminuria remained within the normal range. In group III, macroproteinuria was not consistently modified by perindopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "168": "The influence of captopril on blood platelet aggregation and on serotonergic mechanisms in blood platelets were studied. In rats pretreated with captopril (10.0 mg/kg p.o.) platelet aggregation induced by ADP and collagen was significantly reduced. In vitro this drug had no inhibitory effect. Besides, captopril did not change the amplifying effect of serotonin on platelet aggregation. Captopril also had no influence on the uptake and storage of 5-hydroxytryptamine by rat blood platelets. These results show that serotonergic mechanisms are not involved in the suppressive effect of captopril on platelet aggregation.", 
    "169": "The urinary albumin excretion measured by the albumin creatinine clearance ratio (Calb/Ccreat) and the mean supine arterial blood pressure (MAP) were studied before the start of ACE inhibition, at the start and during up to 1 year of ACE inhibition with Captopril or Enalapril in 35 patients with various chronic proteinuric renal disorders with or without renal failure, arterial hypertension and nephrotic syndrome. Before the start of ACE inhibition mean Calb/Ccreat, MAP, s-albumin and s-creatinine did not change. During ACE inhibition the Calb/Ccreat was reduced from 75% (p less than 0.05) in patients with minimal albuminuria to 41% (p less than 0.005) in patients with extensive albuminuria. Average reduction of albuminuria was 44% at one year's observation time. Serum albumin increased 9% (p less than 0.05), serum creatinine did not change significantly and MAP showed a slight, not uniformly significant decrease. The reduction of Calb/Ccreat was of the same order in the different renal disorders studied and was independent of the renal function, presence or absence of nephrotic syndrome and treatment with antihypertensive or immunosuppressive drugs. The decrease in Calb/Ccreat during ACE inhibition was related to the reduction in MAP at most time intervals, but Calb/Ccreat decreased also when MAP was unchanged or increased. Thus the decrease in Calb/Ccreat during ACE inhibition does not only seem to be a consequence of a decrease in the systemic arterial blood pressure but reasonably also due to changes in the intra-renal hemodynamics and most probably a decrease in the glomerular capillary pressure.", 
    "170": "Some 20 years ago, affinity labelling was introduced to help gather information on active-site catalytic groups and the mechanisms of proteolytic enzymes. Now this knowledge is used to produce specific and selective inhibitors for these enzymes. The concept of \"biospecific drug design\" has stimulated progress in turning the inhibitors into therapeutically applicable agents. For instance, sales of antihypertensive drugs based on inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme are expected to be over 2 billion US-$ in 1992. This partly illustrates the efforts made by many researchers to introduce strategies in potease inhibition for medicinal purposes. This review discusses some of the concepts.", 
    "171": "Dilevalol is a novel antihypertensive drug that combines nonselective beta blockade with selective beta 2-receptor agonist activity. Its antihypertensive effect is mediated through arterial vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. At rest, dilevalol has little effect on heart rate or cardiac output. The drug is rapidly and completely absorbed but undergoes significant first-pass hepatic extraction. Its elimination half-life of approximately 12 hours allows for once-daily administration. In controlled clinical trials, dilevalol was at least as effective as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and comparable to beta blockers in antihypertensive efficacy. Preliminary data indicate that dilevalol reverses left ventricular hypertrophy in some patients. It does not adversely affect renal function and may have a favorable effect on plasma lipids, especially high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The agent is usually well tolerated and may prove to be a useful addition to our antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "172": "The haemodynamic changes that follow a meal can mimic the response to a vasodilator drug. To avoid overestimating the beneficial effects of treatment in uncontrolled studies, measurements of haemodynamic function are usually performed with patients in the fasting postabsorptive state. But such recordings are not representative of the resting patient during daily life. In this double blind placebo controlled study the short term haemodynamic effects of enalapril were assessed during 12 hours in 19 patients with moderate heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. The patients ate lunch and dinner and were studied in the absorptive and postabsorptive phases. In the placebo group systemic vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure, and the rate-pressure product fell significantly (5-16%) after lunch. Four hours after lunch the haemodynamic function had returned to baseline--that is the postabsorptive state. Enalapril, accentuated the haemodynamic effects during the absorptive state producing a larger post-prandial fall in mean arterial blood pressure and rate-pressure product and changes in the absorptive phase were maintained into the post-absorptive phase. Pulmonary wedge pressure fell significantly after treatment with enalapril. These overall changes during the study period indicated that enalapril reduced the preload and afterload on the heart--over and above the reduction produced by eating. These findings suggest that the effects of enalapril given at rest to patients with moderate heart failure unload the heart and enhance the reduction of afterload induced by meals.", 
    "173": "1. In addition to their antihypertensive effect, ACE inhibitors have been reported to increase general well-being, general health and vitality and work performance. The cause of these effects is not known. A possible mechanism may be release of beta-endorphins. 2. In the present study changes in plasma concentration of beta-endorphins on days with ACE inhibitor treatment (n = 12) and on non-treatment control days (n = 12) were compared in 6 patients. 3. Both on control and treatment days the beta-endorphin level fell, by 7.1 and 10.0%, respectively, from 8.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m., reflecting the known diurnal rhythm of this opioid. This difference between the control and treatment days is not statistically significant. 4. The study should be extended to determine endorphin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, and other opioids should be looked for.", 
    "174": "[(Octahydro-2-oxo-7-tetradecylidene-2H-1-benzopyran-8-yl)thio]acet ic acid (MDL 43,291) is a novel leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonist. It is a competitive antagonist of LTD4 (pA2 = 6.7) and LTE4 (pA2 = 6.7) and an apparent noncompetitive inhibitor of LTC4 ('pseudo' pA2 = 6.8) in the longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig ileum. At concentrations that effectively antagonize peptidoleukotriene-induced contractions, MDL 43,291 does not antagonize histamine, carbachol or substance P. In vivo, 10-30 mg/kg MDL 43,291, given intravenously, effectively inhibits increases in insufflation pressure induced by 100 ng/kg i.v. LTD4. This compound is a prototype of a novel class of leukotriene receptor antagonists that may be useful in the treatment of bronchial asthma and related disorders.", 
    "175": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like lisinopril and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like indomethacin have been shown to lower urinary protein excretion in renal disease. If this effect is caused by different mechanisms of action, the combination of these agents could have an additive antiproteinuric effect. We studied the effects of lisinopril and indomethacin separately and in combination in 10 patients with the nephrotic syndrome. Proteinuria was lowered from 10.5 +/- 1.8 g/24 h in the control period to 4.5 +/- 1.1 g/24 h on indomethacin, 4.3 +/- 1.0 g/24 h on lisinopril and to 2.4 +/- 0.8 g/24 h on the combination. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) fell on either monotherapy, but particularly on the combination of drugs. The renal hemodynamic changes suggested a preglomerular vasoconstriction by indomethacin and a postglomerular vasodilation by lisinopril. Severe hyperkalemia occurred in 3 patients on the combination therapy. We conclude that the combination of indomethacin and lisinopril has an additive antiproteinuric effect. This, as well as the more pronounced fall in GFR on the combination, may suggest that both drugs lower proteinuria by decreasing intraglomerular capillary pressure but via different mechanisms. Combining these drugs may be useful in the symptomatic treatment of nephrotic syndrome, but renal function and serum potassium should be monitored carefully.", 
    "176": "The safety and efficacy of lisinopril in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension was evaluated by Belgian general practitioners in patients whose hypertensive condition remained uncontrolled by previous treatment and/or in whom the prior drug regimen was not tolerated. In this 8-week study, 3060 eligible patients were initially treated with 20 mg lisinopril once daily; this dose was increased to 40 mg if diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was greater than 90 mm Hg after 4 weeks. Lisinopril monotherapy in the 1902 patients completing the trial resulted in marked reductions of systolic (SBP) and DBP from 172.5/102.4 mm Hg at baseline to 147.4/86.6 mm Hg by week 8. More than 90% of patients achieved a DBP less than 95 mm Hg. The decrease in blood pressure was similar in patients older and younger than 65 year of age. Only about 20% of patients required an increase in their daily intake of lisinopril to 40 mg. Treatment was well tolerated and the profile of adverse events was similar to the pattern found with other nonsulfydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Tolerance in the elderly was similar to that experience by hypertensives under 65 years of age. Thus, lisinopril at 20 or 40 mg once daily proved both well tolerated and effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "177": "The pathophysiology of acute lung injury after long bone fracture may be associated with endothelial damage and altered fibrinolysis. Accordingly, we studied metabolic functions of pulmonary endothelial cells: 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) uptake and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in anesthetized rabbits before and every 4 h after long bone fracture (n = 12) or sham (n = 6). To assess changes in fibrinolysis, we studied levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), an inhibitor of the fibrinolytic cascade. All animals in the control group and only 6 of 12 animals in the long bone fracture group survived 12 h. 5-HT uptake was depressed after 8 h in both groups. By 12 h, however, 5-HT uptake in the long bone fracture group remained depressed, but returned to baseline in the control group. Conversely, ACE activity was unchanged in both groups. PAI levels were increased in both groups at 4 h. During the next 8 h, levels in the long bone fracture group continued to increase and remained elevated, whereas levels in the control group decreased and were not greater than baseline at 12 h. Initial PAI and 5-HT uptake changes may be related to surgical preparation of the rabbit. Prolonged depression of 5-HT uptake suggests that musculoskeletal trauma is associated with pulmonary endothelial damage. Finally, impaired fibrinolysis due to increased PAI may contribute to the pathogenesis of endothelial injury after long bone fracture.", 
    "178": "1. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor has been isolated from the venom of Vipera aspis aspis by gel filtration and reverse phase HPLC. 2. The purified inhibitor is a decapeptide, whose amino-terminal is blocked, with mol. wt 1044 determined by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. 3. The peptide inhibited the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and Ki values were determined to be 7.54 x 10(-4) and 1.36 x 10(-4) M, respectively, using Hip-His-Leu and Hip-Gly-Gly as substrates 4. The peptide also inhibited the degradation of bradykinin, induced hypotension in spontaneously hypertensive rats and caused an increase in capillary permeability in rabbits, however, it possessed no lethality.", 
    "179": "The converting enzyme not only converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II but also metabolizes bradykinin. Furthermore, the effects of ischemia on myocardial tissue damage can be modulated by converting enzyme inhibitors. It is unknown whether these effects of ACE-inhibitors are due to increased bradykinin production. In this paper we describe the effects of captopril on bradykinin production in the ischemic isolated rat heart. The reduced deleterious effects of ischemia by captopril were associated with a stimulated bradykinin production. Beneficial effects of bradykinin could be due to an improved perfusion or to an effect on cellular metabolism. Therefore, we conclude that this effect on kinins by ACE-inhibitors is of importance in modulating tissue damage during ischemia.",

Two enzymes had different substrate specificity. 2. Mr 140,000 hydrolase activity was inhibited by captopril as reported for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), while that of Mr 70,000 hydrolase activity was inhibited by potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor. 3. An intermediary, des-Leu10-angiotensin I and then angiotensin II were formed from angiotensin I by Mr 70,000 hydrolase. 4. The findings suggest that Mr 70,000 enzyme is tissue carboxypeptidase A, and it generates angiotensin II in granulomatous inflammation as does ACE.", 
    "181": "The pharmacokinetics of cilazapril and its active metabolite cilazaprilat in plasma were investigated in an open study of 13 healthy male volunteers, aged 18 to 43 years. One capsule containing 2.5 mg cilazapril was administered to each volunteer daily for 8 days. Plasma samples were obtained after the first and eighth doses. Concentrations of cilazapril, cilazaprilat and activities of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were measured by radioenzymatic methods. For cilazapril, the values of apparent plasma clearance (about 15 l/h) and volume of distribution (around 28 l) were sufficiently high to suggest that significant pre-systemic hydrolysis to cilazaprilat occurred. There were no significant changes in these values after repeated dosing. There were small, but statistically significant, increases in mean peak concentrations, mean areas under concentration-time curves and mean trough concentrations from the first to the eighth dose. A steady state was achieved after eight doses with an accumulation of 20-30%. The mean effective half-life was approximately 9 h. Despite the accumulation of cilazaprilat in plasma, there were no significant differences in plasma ACE inhibition from the first to the eighth dose.",

An in vitro experiment was carried out to compare the inhibitory effect of SQ29,852 on human renal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with those of captopril, enalapril and enalaprilat. 2. SQ29,852 strongly inhibited human renal ACE; its IC50 value was 1.5 x 10(-8) M. In terms of the IC50, SQ29,852's efficacy was about 1/10 of that of captopril and 1/28 of that of enalaprilat, but it was about 14 times more potent than enalapril. 3. SQ29,852 showed no inhibitory effects on cathepsin D, urinary kallikrein, renal renin, pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. Its ACE-specificity was higher than that of captopril. 4. ACE inhibition by SQ29,852 was shown to be competitive, as revealed by Lineweaver-Burk plots. The affinity of SQ29,852 to ACE was shown to be high by a Ki value of 1.2 x 10(-8) M.", 
    "183": "MK-422 (enalaprilat) (0.0005-0.5%) significantly reduced intraocular pressure (IOP) in African Green monkeys. Studies utilizing unilateral instillation of MK-422 and its inactive R-isomer indicated a local site of action within the eye which is dependent upon inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, also known as kininase II. Tonography showed a small increase (21%) in conventional aqueous humor outflow facility which did not entirely account for the IOP lowering effect of MK-422. Pretreatment with indomethacin or pilocarpine specifically attenuated the ability of MK-422 to lower IOP suggesting that biosynthesis of prostaglandins and uveoscleral outflow pathways are important in mediating the ocular hypotension. The data indicate that MK-422 may lower IOP in monkeys by virtue of its ability to prevent the breakdown of bradykinin and thereby promote the formation of endogenous prostaglandins in the eye.", 
    "184": "Enalapril is an effective angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which produces salutary, beneficial haemodynamic effects in patients with congestive heart failure. Enalapril also produces beneficial neurohumoral changes, as well as improving abnormal coronary haemodynamics and myocardial energetics that are frequently encountered in these patients. Administration of enalapril once or twice daily appears to be quite effective during maintenance therapy in patients with chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "185": "The influence of endogenous opioid system on the rat's mean blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HS) has been studied under the chronic infusion of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally, twice a day, during 6 days) or an inhibitor of captorile enkephalinases (20 mg/kg subcutaneously). Naloxone caused a significant decrease and captorile--increase of maximum meanings of HR during exercises (the running on the treadmill during 3.5 min by the velocity of 30 m/min), both compounds didn't exert a considerable effect on BP at rest and during exercises. It has been concluded that the endogenous opioid system plays an important role in the autonomic HR regulation during exercise.", 
    "186": "Adding converting-enzyme inhibitors to the salt depleted state is marked by a reduction in blood pressure despite compensatory increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine. This study investigated whether this increase in sympathetic function is also accompanied by an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor function. Ten subjects were studied following two separate five day hospitalizations on 10 mEq sodium diets while receiving either placebo or captopril. During low sodium with captopril, blood pressure and angiotensin II decreased, while heart rate, renin, norepinephrine and isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in lymphocytes increased. The results indicate that enhanced beta-adrenergic receptor function does accompany sympathetic activation during sodium restriction and converting enzyme inhibition and further support studies showing that the renin-angiotensin system plays the dominant role in blood pressure regulation in the sodium depleted state.", 
    "187": "The antihypertensive and renal effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril were studied in a group of patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension and impaired renal function. After 12 weeks of treatment, most patients had good blood pressure response to lisinopril monotherapy. During this period, correlations between antihypertensive effect, drug dose, and serum drug level were observed. These correlations were no longer evident after prolonged treatment. During a 1-year follow-up period, the drug dose was lowered gradually without losing antihypertensive effect. Hyperkalemia occurred in one third of the patients. During the 1-year follow-up, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased in two thirds of the patients and remained stable in the other third. In this latter group, the pretreatment GFR was higher, and the effective renal plasma flow had increased, whereas in the patients with a decreased GFR no renal vasodilation had occurred during lisinopril therapy. Thus, lisinopril is an effective antihypertensive drug for patients with impaired renal function. The dose should be adjusted to the pretreatment GFR, and a decrease in dosage should be considered with prolonged treatment.", 
    "188": "While it is known that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the kidney is concentrated at the brush borders of the proximal tubule, the role of tubular ACE in renal physiology is not well understood. The active site of tubular ACE is exposed on the luminal surface of the brush borders and may hydrolyze peptides in the glomerular filtrate. However, a positive correlation between blood pressure and renal ACE activity was observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats, as well as in cases of ACE inhibition. Determination of ACE activity in different renal zones and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ACE predominates in the inner cortex and that the proximal tubule in the outer cortex contains less ACE. Perhaps the inner cortex is the area responsible for alteration of renal ACE activity, since only ACE activity in the inner cortex increased following administration of the ACE inhibitor captopril. This would suggest that the induction of ACE occurs in the inner cortex. Renal ACE activity is also affected by oxidation. Thus, the activity increased when diamide, an oxidizing agent, was added to the crude extract of renal cortex and when oxygen was introduced into the extract. Therefore, tissue oxidation may be one factor affecting renal ACE activity.", 
    "189": "The efficacy and tolerability of lisinopril administered once daily were evaluated in a 12-week open study of 60 elderly patients aged between 65 and 85 years (mean 75 years) with essential hypertension. Mean sitting blood pressure was reduced from 190/106 +/- 6.3/1.3mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) at entry to 162/89 +/- 5.5/0.9 mm Hg after 12 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.001). There was no significant alteration in heart rate, and no occurrence of postural hypotension. The median daily dose of lisinopril was 20mg (range 5 to 40 mg) and only 4 patients required the addition of a diuretic. Mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at entry was 61.6 +/- 3.4 ml/min and was unchanged after 12 weeks of therapy. 25 patients continued to receive treatment for 1 year, and 20 of these completed 2 years of treatment. Control of blood pressure was maintained, and heart rate, biochemical parameters and GFR remained unaltered throughout the study. Renal function was preserved and renal blood flow, measured in a group of 14 patients, was significantly increased (p less than 0.025) at the end of the first year after treatment with lisinopril. Thus, in the elderly, lisinopril was well tolerated and highly effective in lowering blood pressure, and renal function was maintained.", 
    "190": "Lisinopril, a long acting, non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, produces an increase in exercise capacity and an improvement in symptoms when administered in a dose of 5 to 20 mg/day to patients with congestive heart failure. There is an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction, and the effectiveness of the drug is not diminished by impairment of renal function (serum creatinine greater than 71.6 mg/dl). Lisinopril is just as effective in older (greater than 65 years of age) patients as in younger patients and is well tolerated among patients of all age groups.", 
    "191": "The contribution of plasma versus tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to pathophysiology and drug effect is reviewed. The data suggest that tissue ACE is important in influencing local angiotensin levels and that the long term response to an ACE inhibitor is dependent on its action on tissue ACE. The tissue penetration and distribution of various ACE inhibitors may determine their duration of action and the relative effects on different organs, thereby influencing regional blood flow and tissue function. This concept of tissue ACE has improved our understanding of the mechanisms of action of ACE inhibition in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "192": "A new series of highly potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 1-(N2-substituted L-lysyl-gamma-D-glutamyl)octahydro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acids, was synthesized; various acyl groups were introduced at the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal P1 Lys. The effect of the N2-acyl groups on in vitro inhibitory activity and oral antihypertensive effect was examined. All of the synthesized N-acyl tripeptides were found to have in vitro inhibitory activity at an approximately nanomolar level, and showed antihypertensive potency in renal hypertensive rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg, when administered orally. Among them, compounds 7e, g and 9f, i, m showed potent and long-lasting antihypertensive effects compared with enalapril (2a). Their structure-activity relationships are also discussed.", 
    "193": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been suggested to halt the progression of chronic renal failure. As the initial step of a controlled trial of this hypothesis, it was investigated whether start of enalapril in patients with severe chronic nephropathy might cause a critical fall in their renal function. Thirty-one patients were studied, 26 on chronic antihypertensive treatment with drugs other than ACE inhibitors and 5 untreated normotensive. 51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance and renal technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scintigraphy were made before and 24 h after start of enalapril, mean dose 9 mg. Blood pressure fell from median 148/88 to 119/78 mmHg (p less than 0.01). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) fell from median 14 to 12 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p less than 0.01). The median change in GFR was -14% (range -44% to +10%). The split renal function was unchanged and the scintigrams showed no intrarenal activity defects. In conclusion, enalapril caused a fall in GFR, which was clinically acceptable in most of the patients.", 
    "194": "The effects of streptozotocin-induced experimental diabetes on the morphology and secretory activity of the zona glomerulosa were studied in rats whose hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axes and renin-angiotensin systems had been pharmacologically interrupted by the simultaneous administration of dexamethasone-captopril and maintenance doses of ACTH-angiotensin II. The animals were examined 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after diabetes induction, which was evidenced by conspicuous hyperglycemia. Experimental diabetes caused notable atrophy of the zona glomerulosa and its cells, along with a significant decrease in both basal and angiotensin II-stimulated plasma aldosterone concentration. There was a positive linear correlation between all these changes and the number of days elapsed after streptozotocin administration. These data indicate that experimental diabetes exerts a profound time-dependent direct inhibition of rat zona glomerulosa. The hypothesis is advanced that the chronic lack of insulin that occurs in rats treated with streptozotocin, may depress de novo synthesis of structural and enzymatic proteins in zona glomerulosa cells and reduce their growth and steroidogenic machinery.", 
    "195": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal uptake of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were measured in 31 patients with progressive chronic nephropathy before and immediately after the start of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in order to control adverse effects on kidney function. Scintigrams of the kidneys showed an unaltered distribution of DMSA during treatment. GFR estimated by 51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance fell by 14% (P less than 0.01), but renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA increased by 10% (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that DMSA in chronic renal failure is mainly taken up by the tubular cells from the peritubular capillaries since the uptake was unaffected by the acute decrease in GFR.", 
    "196": "Response to drugs in the elderly may be accentuated or modified by age related changes in homeostatic mechanisms such as postural control, orthostatic circulatory responses, thermoregulation, visceral muscle function and higher cognitive function. Changes in specific receptor and target organ responses have also been described. beta-Adrenoceptor-mediated effects are apparently attenuated by a reduction in high affinity binding sites and altered post receptor mechanisms resembling desensitization. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor and cholinergic effects may also be attenuated though there is no evidence for altered alpha 1-adrenoceptor sensitivity. The effects of age on sensitivity to benzodiazepines, calcium channel blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, anticoagulants and cardiac glycosides are also discussed. There is a major requirement for further work in this field.", 
    "197": "The production of prostaglandin (PG) E2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) under basal conditions and after exposure to angiotensin II (ANG II) or arginine vasopressin (AVP) was examined in vitro in isolated glomeruli. The glomeruli were obtained from control rats and rats with bilateral ureteral obstruction (BUO) of 24-h duration that were pretreated or not with an inhibitor of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). Basal prostanoid production was greater in isolated glomeruli from BUO rats than in controls. Administration of an ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat, given in vivo returned basal prostanoid production by isolated glomeruli of BUO rats to levels seen in glomeruli of control rats. The prostanoid production in response to addition of ANG II or AVP in vitro was blunted in glomeruli from BUO rats, but the response was restored to \"normal\" after blockade of ANG II synthesis in vivo in BUO rats. Blockade of ANG II synthesis in vivo did not affect prostanoid synthesis by isolated glomeruli of control rats. The prostanoid generation in response to addition of both ANG II and arachidonic acid in vitro compared with ANG II addition alone was not significantly stimulated in glomeruli from BUO rats. In contrast, it was significantly stimulated in glomeruli of control rats. The results indicate that endogenous ANG II has an important role in the increased synthesis of prostanoids found in isolated glomeruli of rats with BUO and that the in vitro prostanoid production in response to ANG II and AVP can be restored to normal when the synthesis of ANG II is inhibited in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "198": "The serum ACE activity was determined in male Fischer 344 rats at 2, 6, 13, and 25 months of age to determine whether serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity is a potential biomarker of tissue hypothyroidism in aged rats. Since rodent serum contains an ACE activity inhibitor, the measurements were done in both undiluted and 1:8 diluted sera. The highest serum inhibitor activity was found in the 2-month-old animals. The serum ACE activity measured in the diluted serum of the aged rats (77.6 +/- 2.9 units/ml) was significantly reduced compared to 2-month-old (178.2 +/- 6.4 units/ml), 6-month-old (101.5 +/- 6.1 units/ml) and 13-month-old rats (84.9 +/- 8.6 units/ml); (p less than 0.001). Hyperthyroidism induced by injecting L-triiodothyronine (T3) 15 micrograms/100 gm body weight intraperitoneally for 10 days increased the serum ACE activity in the older rats, but reduced the levels in 2-month-old rats. There was no significant change in 6-month-old rats. The levels of serum ACE activity in hypothyroid 6-month-old rats (95.5 +/- 3.5 units/ml) and in 2-month-old-rats (94.2 +/- 4.0 units/ml) were similar to the level seen in hypothyroid old rats (88.9 +/- 5.8 units/ml). Pair feeding of young rats (8 months old) with old did not alter the baseline ACE level (117.4 +/- 3.7 units/ml) or the T3 stimulated (105.2 +/- 10.2 units/ml) serum ACE activity. It is concluded that the reduced serum ACE activity in aged rats cannot be accounted for by the reduced caloric intake or reduced serum thyroid hormone levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Six conscious dogs instrumented for monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and renal blood flow (RBF) were employed in five groups of experiments. In group 1, enalaprilat alone was administered, and it decreased BP by -24 +/- 3 mm Hg and increased RBF by 135 +/- 15 ml/min. During a constant intravenous infusion of saralasin (group 2), enalaprilat decreased BP by -7 +/- 3 mm Hg and increased RBF by 84 +/- 7 ml/min (delta BP and delta RBF, p less than 0.01 vs. group 1 by analysis of variance). During a constant intrarenal arterial infusion of saralasin (group 3), the respective changes in BP and RBF after enalaprilat were -10 +/- 3 mm Hg and 69 +/- 12 ml/min, and these results did not differ from those of group 2. The infusion of saralasin intravenously or intrarenal arterially decreased BP slightly and increased RBF. In the presence of an intravenous infusion of a specific bradykinin antagonist, D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-Phe-Thi-Arg.TFA (B5630) (group 4), enalaprilat decreased BP by -28 +/- 4 mm Hg and increased RBF by 82 +/- 24 ml/min (delta RBF, p less than 0.01 vs. group 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "200": "Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) express the complete renin-angiotensin system and secrete angiotensins. In this study, we examined the adrenergic influence on the secretion of angiotensins from BAECs. Angiotensins were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. At basal state, BAECs contain angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III at concentrations of 2.5 +/- 1.3, 4.8 +/- 2.3, and 3.4 +/- 1.5 pg/10(6) cells, respectively. Angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III concentrations in the culture medium were 8.3 +/- 4.4, 9.4 +/- 3.5, and 9.9 +/- 3.3 pg/10(6) cells, respectively. Isoproterenol (0.1-10 microM) increases secretion of angiotensins I, II, and III in a dose-dependent manner. Increase in angiotensin secretion induced by isoproterenol (10 microM) can be inhibited by beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (1 microM), but not by beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (1 microM). Forskolin (1-1,000 microM) mimics the isoproterenol-induced response. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (1-100 microM) inhibits the secretion. Pretreatment of BAECs with captopril (1 microM) inhibits the accumulation of angiotensin II and angiotensin III in the culture medium, but not angiotensin I. These findings suggest that BAEC production and/or secretion of angiotensins is regulated by adrenergic mechanisms.",

At the end of the treatment blood pressure (BP) fell significantly in the first 3 groups (G1: 155 +/- 19/.98 +/- 11 vs. 136 +/- 11/86 +/- 15 mm Hg, G2: 163 +/- 19/104 +/- 10 vs. 139 +/- 12/90 +/- 8 mm Hg, G3: 166 +/- 17/103 +/- 7 vs. 142 +/- 7/85 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), but remained unchanged in G4. Heart rate was reduced significantly only in G1. Body weight did not change (71 +/- 7 vs. 67 +/- 7, p greater than .05). Patients were subclassified according to wether they had normal (N, LVM less than 120 g/m2 in females, LVm less than 135 g/m2 in males) or increased (H) LVM. There was a significant reduction in LVM in all H subgroups (G1 163 +/- 37 vs. 131 +/- 27 g/m2, G2: 155 +/- 19 vs. 126 +/- 21 g/m2, G3: 158 +/- 2 vs. 138 +/- 38 g/m2, p less than .005). The LVM/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio (M/V) fell in all H subgroups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "202": "The efficacy of three antihypertensive treatments given for 3 weeks each, 2.5 mg cilazapril, a new potent long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, 120 mg propranolol, and the combination of both, were compared in 17 patients suffering from essential hypertension. Blood pressure control (i.e. sitting diastolic blood pressure at rest less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) was achieved in about 40% of the patients by the monocomponents, the combination therapy increased the rate to 80%. An additional blood pressure-lowering effect of the combination was also observed during isometric exercise (handgrip) but not during isotonic exercise (bicycle). At rest and during isometric exercise on cilazapril alone cardiac output rose, total peripheral resistance fell, on propranolol the inverse reactions occurred. On the combination cardiac output and total peripheral resistance decreased. During isotonic exercise propranolol slightly decreased (VO2max fell, lactate concentration went up), cilazapril slightly increased aerobic capacity (VO2max went up and lactate concentration fell) and exercise tolerance. These effects were partially attenuated by the combination. The additional blood pressure-lowering effect of the combination was assumed to be due to the suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (the ACE inhibitor and the betablocker act in a synergistic way), a peripheral vasodilation, and the reduction of sympathetic tone expressed as heart rate reduction and hence a decrease in cardiac output. It is concluded that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a betablocker seems to exert a good antihypertensive activity not only at rest but also during exercise.", 
    "203": "The effect of cilazapril, 2.5 to 5.0 mg on systolic and diastolic cardiac function was studied by echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography, in 15 hypertensive patients. The measurements were made before and 3 hours after the first dose, and after 10 weeks of treatment. Cilazapril lowered the elevated blood pressure and did not affect the normal ejection fraction. An improvement in indices of diastolic function was observed after the first dose. The normalized peak filling rate significantly increased from 2.4 +/- 0.7 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 counts and time to peak filling rate was shortened from 169.4 +/- 31.0 to 151.6 +/- 40.1 msec. This improvement was sustained or even enhanced during chronic therapy. Long-term treatment with cilazapril, caused regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.",

    "205": "After oral administration, ramipril, a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is transformed in the liver into its active metabolite ramiprilat. Because of its pentane ring it is at least 23 times more lipophilic than enalaprilat. The in vitro affinity for ACE is 7 times higher than for enalaprilat and 47 times higher than for captopril. The ramiprilat-ACE complex is therefore very stable and dissociates 6 times more slowly than the enalaprilat ACE complex and 72 times more slowly than the captopril ACE complex. Consequently, ramipril is pharmacologically more potent and has a longer duration of action than enalapril and captopril. The blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibitors is attributed to the decrease in angiotensin II in serum and locally in target organs of hypertension: heart, vessel wall, kidney and brain. Inhibition of tissue renin-angiotensin system by ramipril has been described in target organs of hypertension in animal models and in clinical studies. Possibly due to its high lipophilicity, and strong affinity to the converting enzyme a better tissue penetration and a more pronounced local ACE inhibition in the target organs has been observed, as compared to other ACE inhibitors. In a preliminary investigation a direct action of ramipril on the tissue RAS in hypertensive patients could also be demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "206": "Molecular, biochemical, and pharmacological data give evidence for a local renin angiotensin system (RAS). Infusion of angiotensin (ANG) I into the isolated perfused rat heart resulted in the appearance of ANG II in the venous effluent. In isolated working rat hearts with regional myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were able to reduce the incidence and duration of ventricular fibrillation. Local ACE inhibition in the heart improved cardiodynamics, reduced enzyme release and increased the energy-rich phosphates in ischemic myocardial tissue. Bradykinin perfusion showed an identical fingerprint of effects, whereas ANG I or ANG II perfusion aggravated postischemic reperfusion arrhythmias and induced a deterioration of cardiodynamic and metabolic events. In different studies after myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure (animals and humans) it was demonstrated that long-term ACE inhibitor therapy prolonged survival. Furthermore, ACE inhibition increased exercise capacity in patients with myocardial infarction. In cardiac hypertrophy, ACE inhibitors capable of affecting tissue RAS can induce prevention and regression not only through their blood pressure lowering actions, but possibly also by direct cardiac effects, presumably by inhibition of local ANG II generation, a possible growth factor. These findings from experimental and clinical studies give evidence for cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors. Two to 3 days of pretreatment with 5 mg ramipril given as a once daily dose to hypertensive patients undergoing vascular surgery induced as increase in renin-like activity in carotid and renal arteries, as compared to normo- and hypertensives who did not receive ramipril medication before surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "207": "Cardiac hypertrophy in essential hypertension is documented to be an independent risk factor for congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease and cardiac sudden death. Reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy therefore emerged as a new challenge of antihypertensive treatment. Sympatholytic agents, calcium entry blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been found to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas vasodilators (and most likely also diuretics) are unable to reduce left ventricular mass despite good control of arterial hypertension. Several studies indicated that reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy is not detrimental to cardiac pump function: systolic and diastolic function were found to be maintained at rest and during exposure to increased pressure load. In hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy ventricular arrhythmias have been reported to be increased and to be the pathophysiological link for the increased risk of cardiac sudden death. Reduction of cardiac hypertrophy was found to be accompanied by a reduction of prevalence and severity of ventricular arrhythmias if treated with betablockers, calcium entry blockers or converting enzyme inhibitors. Whether reduction of cardiac hypertrophy indeed decreases the cardiovascular risk attributed to left ventricular hypertrophy is unknown at present, although clinical studies support such a viewpoint.", 
    "208": "In the investigation of hypotensive mechanisms for the converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, precise methods for plasma kinin and angiotensin II measurement are essential. We describe here determination methods of plasma kinin and angiotensin II, and their applications to converting enzyme inhibitor administration. In our kinin RIA system, a high titered antiserum (final dilution 1:640,000) was used. Sensitivity was 0.25 pg/tube. Regarding plasma kinin measurement, an inhibitor mixture including aprotinin, hexadimethrine, SBTI, phenanthroline and EDTA, was used to collect the plasma sample. The determined plasma kinin levels in normal subjects were below 10 pg/ml. A very sensitive and simplified direct RIA system for plasma angiotensin II was also developed in our laboratory using the very high titered antiserum (final dilution 1:1,500,000). The sensitivity was 0.1 pg/tube, and cross-reactivity of angiotensin I was less than 0.1%. These data suggest that plasma angiotensin II level can be determined directly in very small plasma samples, such as 0.1 ml by this RIA system even in the ACE inhibitor administration. The plasma angiotensin II levels in normal subjects were 12.0 pg/ml. Both of these RIAs which were applied to the clinical experiments of ACE inhibitor administration.", 
    "209": "The haemodynamic response achieved by isradipine (Lomir) is balanced; there is a marked decrease in total peripheral resistance with no clinically significant tachycardia or cardiodepressant effect, no fluid retention (a natriuretic/diuretic effect is seen) or orthostatic reactions, whereas the blood flow to vital organs is preserved. Isradipine is highly efficacious in monotherapy and has shown greater or equal efficacy compared to other first line antihypertensive drugs, without an increase in adverse effects. Combination therapy with a beta-blocker or an ACE-inhibitor is safe and offers a useful additional reduction in blood pressure. Isradipine's antiatherogenic properties, cardioprotection, and capacity to reduce cerebral infarct size require further evaluation in clinical studies but add an interesting aspect to the drug. Against this background, isradipine appears to be a useful contribution to our therapeutic arsenal and has the potential to become the drug of choice in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "210": "1. We have studied the effects of low dose infusions of atrial natriuretic factor (human ANF (99-126), 1.95 pmol/min per kg) on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced haemodynamic and hormonal changes in healthy subjects. 2. ACE inhibitor (captopril 25 mg, administered orally) was given against a background infusion of physiological saline (placebo day) or ANF (experimental day). 3. Compared with the placebo observations, ANF enhanced the fall in plasma aldosterone concentrations induced by captopril (P less than 0.05). 4. The rise of plasma renin activity following administration of ACE inhibitor which was observed during placebo infusion was abolished by ANF (P less than 0.05). 5. The responses of systemic blood pressure and heart rate to the converting enzyme inhibition were not affected by the infusion of ANF. 6. These results suggest that variations in endogenous circulating ANF may influence, in part, the response of these hormonal levels during ACE inhibition.", 
    "211": "Monotherapy of hypertension should be the goal of treatment. Even in the elderly hypertensive patient there is a good response to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as well as to diuretics and calcium channel blockers, despite the low plasma renin activity seen in the elderly. Adverse effects on metabolism and quality of life should be avoided in elderly patients as well as in younger hypertensive patients. Combinations of 2 drugs will not necessarily eliminate these undesirable effects, but drug combinations will be required in half of the hypertensive population. It is reasonable, when a second drug is added, to use one with a different mode of action. The role of diuretics, which have been the mainstay of antihypertensive therapy for a long time, may ultimately become that of a second drug in combination treatment.", 
    "212": "Up to the present time, it has not been possible to establish the exact role that the renin-angiotensin system plays in the development and persistence of arterial hypertension in human beings. The tissular renin-angiotensin systems which have been studied in different tissular locations, cerebral, cardiac, vascular, play a role which consists in regulating the regional blood flow, in conjunction with the sympathetic nervous system. The tissular renin-angiotensin systems would then act when the physio-pathological alteration which initially caused to the triggering of the general renin-angiotensin system persists after arterial blood pressure has returned to normal levels. Although renin blocking is, in theory, the most efficient method for checking the renin-angiotensin system, in practical terms, the best therapeutical option is still the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme. However, the obtention of an active orally administered compounds capable of inhibiting renin synthesis or action must be considered as an accomplishment still to come. Similarly, the discovery of compounds which are analogous to the natriuretic atrial peptides, and can be administered enterally, also represent a prospect worth bearing in mind for the treatment of arterial hypertension. Since we are aware of the importance of vasodilating renal prostaglandins and modulipin in maintaining renal function in the various forms of arterial hypertension, what must still be established is the role played by these prostanoids in the physiopathology of arterial hypertension in human beings.", 
    "213": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril and enalapril and the nootropic piracetam reduced the amnesiogenic effects of cerebral electroshock treatment in mice. These compounds also directly improved passive-avoidance learning if administered before the learning trial. When given immediately after the learning trial, captopril and piracetam were active, but not enalapril. Captopril, but neither enalapril nor piracetam, facilitated memory retrieval after a 2-month retention interval. Unlike those of piracetam, the memory-improving effects of captopril and enalapril are not established by aldosterone-receptor blockade, suggesting that the two types of drug act via different mechanisms of action.", 
    "214": "Ramipril is a long acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which exhibits similar pharmacodynamic properties to captopril and enalapril. Like enalapril it is a prodrug, which is hydrolysed after absorption to form the active metabolite ramiprilat which has a long elimination half-life, permitting once daily administration. In hypertensive patients daily doses in the range 2.5 to 20 mg are usually effective in reducing high blood pressure and maintaining satisfactory control during long term treatment. Patients who do not respond adequately to monotherapy with ramipril usually respond with the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or piretanide. Ramipril 5 to 10 mg once daily shows comparable antihypertensive efficacy to usual therapeutic dosages of captopril, enalapril and atenolol in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Preliminary data indicate that ramipril may be effective in indications such as severe essential hypertension and renal hypertension. It has also displayed beneficial effects in patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Ramipril has been well tolerated and exhibits an adverse effect profile typical of ACE inhibitors as a class. In conclusion, ramipril will likely represent a useful alternative ACE inhibitor for use in patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure.", 
    "215": "The responses of forearm bloodflow and heart rate to the Valsalva maneuvre were investigated in patients treated with placebo or cilazapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Twenty-four uncomplicated hypertensives, whose sitting diastolic blood pressures remained within 94 to 114 mmHg after four weeks of placebo therapy, were randomly assigned on a double-blind basis to receive either further placebo or cilazapril (1.25 to 5.0 mg/day, single dose) for a further four weeks. At the end of weeks 4 and 8, each patient performed standardized Valsalva maneuvres before and 2 h after the day's dose of medication. For each maneuvre, forearm bloodflow was measured in the resting phase and at the point of maximum tachycardia during the straining phase, together with a continuous record of heart rate. All patients exhibited the appropriate heart rate response to the maneuvre with marked tachycardia followed by bradycardia on release of straining. There were no differences in the degree of tachycardia, bradycardia or the Valsalva ratio as a result of cilazapril therapy. There were no changes in resting forearm bloodflow as a result of drug therapy but the flow was reduced (P less than 0.01) during the straining period of all maneuvres. The relative decrease in flow during the maneuvre was attenuated (P less than 0.05) in the cilazapril-treated patients at all drug doses but not in those taking placebo. Cilazapril appears to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system response to the baroreceptor stimulation of the Valsalva maneuvre but not the parasympathetic response of heart rate.", 
    "216": "In feral populations of African green monkeys or vervets (Cercopithecus aethiops), between 5 and 15% of adults have spontaneously elevated blood pressure (BP). We report here the initial biological and pharmacological characterization of this potential animal model of hypertension. Captive male monkeys with elevated systolic pressures show a modest pressure increase in response to stressors such as capture, phlebotomy and cold challenge. Acute captopril administration lowers BP in monkeys with high blood pressure (HBP), but has no effect on BP in control animals. Furosemide does not acutely reduce BP. Animals with elevated BPs have lower levels of angiotensin II than do age- and weight-matched controls. An acute infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) diminishes BP and stimulates urinary output in control and HBP vervets. However, both effects are more pronounced in animals with HBP. Heart rate is not affected by any of the experimental manipulations. Taken together, these data suggest that African green monkeys with spontaneously elevated BP may be a useful experimental model for particular types of human hypertension. Additional studies are required to complete the endocrine and pharmacological characterization of individual animals with HBP.", 
    "217": "A placebo-controlled study of Ramipril on total and intrarenal flow distribution was carried out in 7 patients with essential hypertension. Cortical nephron flow was measured using radiolabelled tubular secreted radiopharmaceuticals 123I orthoidohippurate or 99mTc mercaptoacetyl triglycine by the transit time distribution technique. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced significantly by Ramipril without significant changes in an index of cardiac output or in effective renal plasma flow. Cortical nephron flow increased from 207 +/- 7 to 257 +/- 21 ml/min (mean +/- SEM) p less than 0.05 and the percentage of flow to cortical nephrons increased by 6% (p = 0.05). Ramipril corrects the reduced cortical nephron flow found in essential hypertension.",

Hypertension of 10-week duration caused a twofold increase in the left ventricular weight/body weight ratio, a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and an eightfold increase in left ventricular ANP mRNA levels in RHRs, as compared with the levels in control rats. Uninephrectomy or 4 weeks of treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril reduced the blood pressure to the control level, with the complete reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and ANP mRNA levels. Four weeks of treatment with the arterial vasodilator hydralazine significantly, but not completely, reduced the high blood pressure, but it did not influence left ventricular hypertrophy, end-diastolic pressure, and ANP mRNA levels. The increased ANP synthesis observed in the right ventricles of RHRs also reverted to the control level by uninephrectomy or enalapril treatment, but not by hydralazine, with a time course similar to that of left ventricular ANP. In addition, uninephrectomy caused the left and right ventricular ANP and ANP mRNA levels of RHRs to fall to the levels of control rats as early as 1 week, despite persistent left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "219": "The antiproteinuric efficacy of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) has been extensively investigated in patients with several types of nephropathy, but there are few data on the use of ACEI in patients with primary glomerular disease without renal function impairment. We evaluate the effect of long-term therapy with captopril on arterial pressure and proteinuria in 13 patients with primary glomerular disease, selected on the following criteria: persistent proteinuria greater than 600 mg/day, serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl, no dietary restriction or antihypertensive or immunosuppressive therapy for at least 9 months prior to enrolment. Ten of 13 patients were normotensive. The treatment with captopril induced an early and persistent decrease in proteinuria (41%), and a significant increase in serum albumin. We did not find a significant correlation between changes in MAP and changes in protein loss or between variations in serum creatinine and in proteinuria. Our results demonstrate that captopril is effective in reducing proteinuria in patients with primary glomerular disease with normal renal function. Since the antiproteinuric effect is not associated to a concomitant decrease in arterial pressure, we presume that it might be due to a specific intrarenal action of captopril.", 
    "220": "Renal growth often precedes scarring in experimental models of chronic renal failure in rats. Its control may therefore influence the subsequent development of renal scarring and failure in these animals. In this study we have attempted to manipulate, by pharmacological interventions, compensatory renal growth in rats who have undergone uninephrectomy. The effects of three drugs--enalapril, verapamil and indomethacin--were investigated. Compensatory renal growth was found to be 15.33 +/- 13.76% (mean +/- SD) 1 week after uninephrectomy in control adult male Wistar rats. Compensatory renal growth was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with enalapril 7.38 +/- 8.88% (P less than 0.05) but was unaffected by indomethacin; the effect of verapamil was inconclusive. In controls, both the protein and DNA content of the remaining kidney increased, indicating a mixed hypertrophic and hyperplastic response. Enalapril inhibited the hyperplastic component of compensatory renal growth. We conclude that following uninephrectomy in rats, compensatory hypertrophy can be manipulated by pharmacological interventions, in particular angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition by enalapril.", 
    "221": "Twenty-three patients with mild heart failure (I-II NYHA classes) on digitalis and diuretics were assigned to the following treatment in a random and double-blind fashion: ibopamine-captopril, ibopamine-placebo, captopril-placebo, and placebo-placebo. The doses of captopril and ibopamine were respectively 25 mg t.i.d. and 100 mg t.i.d. The incremental exercise time (until exhaustion) and the peak VO2 (oxygen consumption), the indexes of left ventricular function (by echo and nuclear stethoscope) and ventricular arrhythmias (evaluated by prolonged Holter monitoring) were assessed before randomization, at 45 days and at 3 months. Ejection fraction, exercise time, peak VO2, ventricular arrhythmias and heart rate (at rest and during exercise) appeared to be equally unaffected by each treatment. Our results show that ibopamine exerts no significant effects on either heart rate or ventricular arrhythmias and that indexes of left ventricular function are not modified by any treatment in mild congestive heart failure.", 
    "222": "To investigate the time relationships involved in cyclosporin-induced nephrotoxicity we studied changes in blood pressure, renal haemodynamics and sodium excretion in 22 adult patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus treated with cyclosporin (CsA) for 4 +/- 2 days, compared to 22 insulin-dependent diabetic patients receiving conventional insulin therapy, who were matched for age and duration of diabetes. To further clarify the pathogenic role of the renin-angiotensin system, insulin-dependent diabetic patients receiving CsA were studied before and after sublingual administration of 75 mg captopril. An average of 4 days CsA treatment markedly increased blood pressure and renal vascular resistance, but did not alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, sodium urinary excretion, or body-weight. The marked renal vasoconstriction without early changes in GFR suggests that the late decrease in GFR may involve other factors in addition to renal hypoperfusion. Acute inhibition of angiotension II formation was still able to decrease blood pressure and renal vascular resistance, although not to normal control values. These results indicate that a physiological concentration of angiotensin II may potentialise but may not be the sole factor involved in the vasopressor effect of CsA.", 
    "223": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially indomethacin, have variable effects on proteinuria when used alone, but can dramatically reduce proteinuria if combined with diuretics and sodium restriction. Reduction of angiotensin II concentrations in plasma and kidney following angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition also reduces proteinuria, not only in nephrotic conditions but also in diverse diseases, including diabetes mellitus, glomerulosclerosis following subtotal nephrectomy, and membranous nephropathy. The reduction of proteinuria appears independent of decrements in blood pressure since other hypotensive agents do not alter proteinuria in these conditions.", 
    "224": "We recently reported that renin, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were present in normal human pituitary lactotroph cells and PRL-secreting adenomas. Angiotensin-II and -III have also been shown to modulate PRL release in vitro. The present study was designed to determine whether angiotensin modulates PRL secretion in vivo. In 36 hypertensive patients with widely varying renin levels, active renin and basal PRL levels did not correlate. In 10 normal volunteers, both a sustained infusion of angiotensin-II and a graded infusion of angiotensin-III induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in aldosterone levels, but had no effect on PRL secretion. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril had no effect on PRL circadian rhythm in 10 normal subjects or on PRL concentrations in 11 patients with PRL-secreting adenomas. Cross-over administration of placebo and captopril did not affect the peak PRL level measured after TRH treatment in 10 hypertensive men (placebo, 43.1 +/- 5.4; captopril, 40.0 +/- 6.2 micrograms/L; P = NS) or the rise in PRL induced by doperidone in 6 normal women (placebo, 129.5 +/- 16.2; captopril, 150.0 +/- 35.7 micrograms/L; P = NS). Further, administration of enalapril for 30 days to 6 hypertensive patients did not alter basal PRL concentrations or the peak concentrations induced by TRH. These data indicate that in humans the circulating renin-angiotensin system does not interact with diurnal PRL release or with the response to TRH or domperidone.", 
    "225": "Studies on experimental animals indicate that ACE-inhibition might play an important role in coronary flow regulation and reperfusion damage limitation by alleviating non-irreversible myocardial damage and reducing Hyperkinetic Ventricular Arrhythmias (HVA) caused by reperfusion. This suggests the usefulness of captopril, an ACE-inhibitor containing the -SH group, in combination with systemic thrombolysis or mechanical revascularisation. The study was performed on seventy-two patients admitted to the hospital within 4 h of the onset of major cardiac symptoms due to Unstable Angina Pectoris (UAP) or Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). They were randomized either to treatment with oral captopril 15 min before thrombolysis (thirty-seven patients), or to thrombolysis followed by oral captopril on day 3-4 (thirty-five patients). In the early captopril-treated patients, a significant reduction in early arrhythmias was observed within 2 h, a lower incidence of late arrhythmias and a faster normalisation of necrosis enzymes. These data provide further evidence for the useful role of early captopril treatment in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "226": "A review of the literature concerning quality of life aspects on ACE-inhibitors in hypertensive patients is given. In the first part of the eighties two prospective multi-center randomised trials were conducted to determine the effect of captopril in comparison to methyldopa or an unselective beta-blocker on the quality of life in patients with mild to moderate hypertension (Hill et al. and Croog et al.). Both studies revealed slight but significant positive effects on indices of quality of life in captopril treated patients compared to those who had methyldopa or an unselective beta-blocker. Later, another ACE-inhibitor, enalapril, has been compared with a selective beta-blocker (Edmonds et al. and Herrick et al.) with respect to side-effects and the quality of life. The measurements of the quality of life tended to favour enalapril, but the differences were small and the over-all tolerability of the two drugs was similar. In conclusion, comparisons with more long standing forms of antihypertensive therapy suggest a slightly more favourable effect of ACE-inhibitors on the quality of life.", 
    "227": "Chronic decreases in arterial blood flow rates elicit arterial constriction followed by remodeling of the artery wall that entrenches a reduced internal diameter. This adaptive response may provide an important compensatory adaptation to physiological reductions in blood flow, but it may also exacerbate pathologic disorders that compromise tissue perfusion. A capacity to manipulate this response requires a knowledge of the mechanisms that control it. Our studies have shown that the response is endothelium-dependent, and that it is probably initiated by release of a vasoconstrictor. This finding suggests that endothelium-derived agonist(s) are involved. We assessed the potential role of prostanoids, endothelin, and a local vessel wall renin-angiotensin system. All of these assessments yielded negative results. It appears, therefore, that a novel vasoactive substance initiates the adaptive response of arteries to reduced blood flow.", 
    "228": "The captopril test was performed in 49 children of whom 36 were hypertensive, and the remainder were normotensive but at risk for developing hypertension because of scarred kidneys secondary to vesicoureteral reflux. The blood pressure was monitored in fasting supine patients throughout the duration of the test. Blood was taken for measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA), then captopril (0.7 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally. A second blood sample was taken for PRA measurement 90 min after captopril administration. The mean PRA at 90 min was 11.90 +/- (SEM) 4.01 ng/l/s (42.84 +/- 14.44 ng/ml/h) in 7 patients with renovascular disease. In 4 patients with essential hypertension, the corresponding value was 0.88 +/- 0.38 ng/l/s (3.17 +/- 1.37 ng/ml/h). Patients with other renal diseases showed variable values. Some individuals had PRA values as high as those of patients with renovascular disease, but the etiology of their hypertension was usually clinically evident. Our preliminary data would suggest that the captopril test may help differentiate between patients with essential hypertension and those with renovascular disease or may help select patients that should be followed up by more definitive diagnostic procedures.", 
    "229": "To assess the anti-anginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of the ACE-inhibitor enalapril in normotensive coronary patients, a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study was performed. Eight male patients, aged 45-68 years, with stable effort angina were given enalapril (10 mg) once a day or placebo for 7 days. Maximal exercise stress tests 10w/min in the upright position were performed at the end of each period. In comparison to placebo, enalapril increased significantly 1 mm of ST depression time and decreased significantly ST depression at maximal common work. Moreover, enalapril increased significantly the angina threshold and exercise duration. Three of the eight patients ended the exercise without pain. The rate-pressure product was not significantly modified at any time. Thus, the anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal activity may be due to an increase of coronary blood flow, rather than a reduction of MVO2 consumption.", 
    "230": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now in widespread use for the treatment of essential and renovascular hypertension. Consequently, angioedema, an uncommon complication of ACE inhibitor therapy is being encountered with increasing frequency. Since ACE inhibitor angioedema predominantly involves the face, lips, oral cavity, and occasionally the larynx the otolaryngologist is often consulted to evaluate affected patients. Treatment ranges from simple cessation of the drug to emergent airway intervention. The pertinent pharmacologic properties of ACE inhibitors and the pathophysiology of angioedema are discussed. The authors' experience with the evaluation and treatment of ACE inhibitor induced angioedema is presented.", 
    "231": "Bilateral electrocoagulation of the central veins of the adrenals (ECVA) was performed in 13 patients with stable and malignant arterial hypertension (AH). The renin-dependent character of AH was supported by positive reaction of arterial pressure (AP) to the test dose of captopril (25 mg). The vasorenal origin of the impairment was excluded on the basis of the peripheral captopril test findings, pharmacorenography with captopril. Bilateral ECVA was done during angiography. The manipulation turned out technically successful in 11 left (85%) and 9 right (70%) adrenals. The AP began lowering from the first days of the intervention and got stabilized by day 4 to 5. There was a significant decline of AP within the observation period up to 1 year and a reduction of the elevated aldosterone content and plasma renin activity with the content of ACTH being unchanged. After the manipulation 2 patients could fully discontinue the intake of hypotensive drugs. In 11 patients, the dose of the drugs could be reduced.", 
    "232": "The pharmacodynamic effects and acceptability of perindopril (4 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg daily) given alone or in combination for 1 month were investigated in a double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study. The pharmacokinetics of perindopril and its active metabolite perindoprilat and the time course of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition were studied for 72 h following the last dose of treatment in the two appropriate groups. Similar decreases in blood pressure were seen 24 h after the last dose of perindopril or hydrochlorothiazide (11/7 mm Hg supine) given alone at these doses. The effect of these drugs given together was additive on diastolic blood pressure and synergistic on systolic blood pressure (24.5/12.6 mm Hg supine) taking into account the placebo response. The significant increase in plasma renin activity produced by perindopril alone was potentiated by concurrent administration of hydrochlorothiazide. The formation of perindoprilat was slightly reduced in the group also receiving hydrochlorothiazide and there was a very small reduction in ACE inhibition in this group. Perindopril, whether given alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, was well tolerated and produced no clinically significant change in routine haematology or serum biochemistry. The additive or synergistic effects of perindopril and hydrochlorothiazide on blood pressure must be due to their complementary physiological actions and not to a pharmacokinetic interaction.", 
    "233": "Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may lower urinary protein excretion, it is not known whether these agents can completely eliminate microalbuminuria. This study examined whether the ACE inhibitor, enalapril, can abolish low levels of microalbuminuria in diabetic patients. Six men with adult-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, most of whom had low levels of microalbuminuria, were studied in a clinical research center, where they ate a controlled diet and performed regulated exercises daily. After 2 weeks of baseline measurements, the patients received 5-15 mg/day of enalapril for 4 weeks. They were then monitored for 2 more weeks without enalapril. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) fell in each patient with enalapril treatment and was within the normal range at some time during enalapril treatment in 5 of 6 patients. After stopping enalapril, UAE rose. UAE was 53.6 +/- 20.7 (SEM), 31.5 +/- 8.9 and 39.4 +/- 8.0 mg/24 h during the baseline, enalapril and postenalapril periods, respectively (baseline vs. enalapril, p less than 0.02; postenalapril vs. enalapril, p less than 0.01). The magnitude of fall in UAE correlated with the baseline UAE (r = 0.90). During enalapril treatment, renal plasma flow and GFR did not change, although blood pressure fell slightly. These data suggest that enalapril can reduce or abolish UAE in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. Whether long-term treatment with enalapril will continue to suppress microalbuminuria and prevent progressive diabetic nephropathy remains to be determined.", 
    "234": "Twenty-one subjects who suffered a recent medium sized anterior myocardial infarction conditioning a mild congestive heart failure were randomly allocated to treatment with captopril (25 mg b.i.d., 10 pts) or placebo (11 pts). After 2 months of therapy the group on the active treatment showed a significant increase of apexcardiographic protodiastolic filling period duration reflecting a clear cut decrease of mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (from 14 +/- 2 to 7 +/- 3 mm Hg) while patients on placebo did not show any difference in respect to baseline. Neither treatment significantly modified the PEP/LVET ratio despite a significant increase of left ventricular ejection fraction in patients receiving captopril (from 37 +/- 4% to 43 +/- 5%). Cardiac response to ACE-inhibitors can thus be noninvasively monitored by apexcardiography.", 
    "235": "1. Repeated oral administrations of tryptic hydrolysate of bovine milk casein (CEI) showed antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 2. Single oral administration of CEI antagonized the pressor response to angiotensin I. 3. Bovine milk casein hydrolysate inhibited the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Three peptides with ACE-inhibiting activity were isolated from CEI. 4. It is suggested that ACE-inhibiting peptides in the tryptic hydrolysate milk casein are absorbed from the intestinal tract and produce an antihypertensive effect.", 
    "236": "1. The vasorelaxant effect of synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on the vascular response to angiotensin II (A II) and norepinephrine (NE) in aortic rings from Bufo arenarum toad was studied. 2. Pretreatment with ANP partially inhibited the vascular response to A II and NE. 3. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatment partially inhibited the contractile response of angiotensin I (A I) and did not affect the A II response. 4. The inhibitory effect of ANP on vascular response to A II and NE were potentiated by pretreatment with ACEI. 5. Results suggest that the angiotensin converting enzyme present in the vascular wall from Bufo arenarum toad may be involved in the metabolism of ANP.", 
    "237": "Long-term glycaemic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin concentration was compared in hypertensive NIDD's taking placebo, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers (alone and in combination) and an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) each for 4 months. Alpha-blockade caused no deterioration in long-term glycaemic control in NIDD's. Beta-blockers caused a deterioration in glycaemic control in NIDD's (with some adverse effects on lipid profile). This was especially apparent with the lipophilic beta-blocker P. Concurrent use of an alpha-blocker with a beta-blocker prevents the deterioration due to beta-blockade. The ACE inhibitor, enalapril caused an improvement in long-term glycaemic control without alteration of lipid control in NIDD's.", 
    "238": "The usefulness and limitations of the current medical treatment of high blood pressure are analysed. The latest strategies in the management of hypertension are presented, with emphasis on the treatment of all associated cardiovascular risk factors. This is and important therapeutic goal of Preventive Cardiology. The individualized treatment, that is to say, the selection of the antihypertensive therapy according to the characteristics of each patient, is discussed as an objective of the present therapy. Finally, the new drugs and the recent advances in the classic ones are examined with a special focus on their hemodynamic actions and on their role in left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "239": "The purpose of this prospective study was to compare two methods of evaluating antihypertensive treatment efficacy: the traditional sphygmomanometric method and automatic home recording. Thirty hypertensive patients were studied who had been on antihypertensive therapy for at least 3 months. In the first 3 weeks of study their therapy was left unchanged and their diastolic blood pressures, measured with the traditional sphygmomanometer (weekly morning visit in the outpatient clinic; three successive recordings at 5-min intervals; subject seated), were always higher than 95 mmHg. During the following 8 weeks, the physician tried to reduce diastolic blood pressure to not greater than 90 mmHg by changing or increasing the therapy. Before and after any modification in therapy, noninvasive, automatic home, blood pressure monitorings for 24 hours were obtained and analyzed with Halberg's method of single cosinor, but were not made available to the physician until the end of the study. Automatic recordings showed that 18 patients had already had a circadian diastolic mesor less than or equal to 90 mmHg under the original drug regimen. By changing or increasing the therapy, no additional pressure decrease was seen in the home pressure recordings of the whole group of patients, whereas the sphygmomanometric diastolic pressures of 15 patients fell under 90 mmHg. Our study provides additional evidence that casual sphygmomanometric measurements can be misleading when one tries to assess the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy, and a cause of potential overtreatment.", 
    "240": "Captopril, a potent antihypertensive that acts via inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme also has apparent central actions. Its effects on membrane properties on particular central neurons in-vitro has therefore been investigated. In the substantia nigra, where there is a high concentration of angiotensin converting enzyme, captopril caused a dose-dependent depolarization without any apparent change in conductance, but possibly requiring the integrity of the dendritic arbour. A similar effect occurred when captopril was applied to neurons in either the thalamus or hippocampus, where levels of angiotensin converting enzyme are relatively low. Further studies with homologues of captopril revealed that the -SH group on the molecule was a prerequisite of the effect observed. It is concluded that the -SH group on the captopril molecule has an electrogenic effect on diverse central neurons, independent of inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, but preferentially manifest at the level of the dendrite.", 
    "241": "Currently 4 classes of antihypertensive drugs - diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors - are most commonly used to treat hypertensive patients. Each class of drug has a distinctive cardiovascular pharmacodynamic profile and even within classes there exist agents with slightly different properties. The effects of the various drug classes on the heart and peripheral circulation, on the kidney and electrolyte metabolism, on the brain and on the renin-angiotensin system are now reasonably well described. Knowledge and understanding of these different cardiovascular effects are extremely important in order to adapt treatment to the needs of an individual patient. Furthermore, when combination therapy becomes necessary, the different cardiovascular aspects of the various drugs can be used to enhance antihypertensive efficacy and to attenuate adverse effects of separate compounds.", 
    "242": "Conscious instrumented rabbits were bled at a constant rate of congruent to 3% of the blood volume (BV) per minute. We determined the BV-response relationships for mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), mesenteric and hindlimb blood flows, and for the corresponding conductances. We studied the responses 1) under normal conditions; 2) after pretreatment with captopril, arginine vasopressin (AVP) antagonist, or both; 3) during total autonomic blockade (TAB); and 4) during neurohumoral blockade (NHB, i.e., TAB + captopril + AVP antagonist). We determined the direct local response component from the responses obtained during NHB. The local chronotropic effects congruent to 0, so that the reflex rise in HR was entirely autonomically mediated. The local vascular response consisted of vasodilatation and provided the base line for assessing the estimated constrictor component from the net response from control, with the former ranging from 2 to 16 times the conventional estimates based on the net responses. In normal rabbits, the phase of good maintenance of MAP was entirely governed by autonomic mechanisms, which minimized the fall in CO and offset the local vasodilator component. During the hypotensive phase immediately after hemorrhage, when congruent to 30-35% BV had been removed, the constrictor effects of AVP and angiotensin II (ANG II) became important, whereas the role of autonomic mechanisms diminished. During TAB, the constrictor effects of AVP and ANG II were prominent even with small BV losses.", 
    "243": "Of the approximately 58 million Americans with hypertension, the majority have only mild increases in blood pressure and individually are at low risk. Large group studies, however, have demonstrated the efficacy of treating mild hypertension. Public health efforts during the past 16 years have increased the number of hypertensive patients made aware of their condition and brought into treatment. A major problem, however, is consistently maintaining patients on long-term therapy. A large number of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments have become available for the management of hypertension. These treatments must be applied individually to enhance benefit, minimize potential harm, and increase the likelihood of long-term compliance for what is often a lifelong disorder. For accomplishing this goal, a thorough understanding of important characteristics of both the individual patient and the available therapeutic modalities is needed.", 
    "244": "The role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) during pregnancy is not fully understood but numerous studies point to its importance in the homoeostasis of the fetal blood pressure and in the physiology of the fetal kidney near term. The aim of this study was to investigate the tissue distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the pregnant rabbit and its fetus and to assess the effect of Perindopril (PIL) a new ACE inhibitor on maternal and fetal tissue ACE activity. On day 28 of gestation, animals of the experimental groups were gavage-fed with 1 mg PIL or 10 mg PIL. ACE activity was assayed in tissue homogenates and serum with a radio-enzymatic method using (Gly-1-14C)-hippuryl-L-histidyl-leucine as specific substrate. In the kidney of control pregnant rabbit, decreasing values of ACE were found with a concentration gradient from the cortex to the inner papilla. ACE values in lung were comparable to those seen in kidney cortex. A significant effect of PIL was found with a percentage of inhibition of ACE activity in the renal cortex above 74% after 1 mg PIL and 88% after 10 mg PIL. In the control group, ACE activity was predominant in lung of fetuses. After maternal administration of 1 mg PIL, ACE activity fell significantly in fetal serum, placenta and fetal lung, but not in fetal kidney. Ten mg PIL produced a further significant decrease in ACE activity in fetal organs and serum. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was significantly stimulated after PIL administration in both mothers and fetuses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "245": "An in vitro model using cultured rabbit pulmonary endothelial cells of microvascular origin was developed to define the luminal surface membrane characteristics of microvascular endothelium. Endothelial cells were isolated from peripheral lung segments and sorted after preferential uptake of a fluorescent derivative, diiodoindocarbo cyanine acetylated-LDL. Cells were further characterized by demonstrating angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on their surface by means of indirect immunofluorescence. ACE activity and its pharmacologic modification were then studied as functional assays of cell activity. Hydrolysis of Benz-phe-ala-pro (BPAP), a synthetic substrate for ACE was saturable over a concentration range of 1 to 100 microns. Thus, BPAP hydrolysis in cultured microvascular endothelial cells behaves overall in a manner similar to that seen in large resistance vessels except that a portion of the hydrolysis is not inhibited by captopril, an ACE-specific inhibitor, indicating the presence of another protease capable of BPAP hydrolysis. Accordingly, this system can be used to compare ACE and other protease kinetics in microvessel cells with those of large vessel endothelium or perfused lungs.", 
    "246": "Pulmonary vascular relaxant effects of the 28-amino acid atrial natriuretic peptide and atriopeptins I, II and III (21, 23 and 24 amino acid peptides, respectively) were studied in isolated blood vessels and in perfused rat lungs. In isolated tissue studies, intrapulmonary arteries were more responsive to the relaxant effects of atrial peptides than the main pulmonary artery or aorta. In perfused lung preparations, each of the four atrial peptides produced dose-dependent pulmonary vasodilation of PGF2 alpha or hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. Atriopeptin I was the least potent pulmonary vasodilator peptide in all studies. Pretreatment of perfused lungs with various peptidase inhibitors, including the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and MK-521, the carboxypeptidase inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline, and the aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin, variably potentiated the pulmonary vasodilator activities of the atrial peptides. The results demonstrate that atrial peptides released from the right heart into the pulmonary circulation can have potent vasorelaxant effects in the pulmonary vascular bed and further suggest that upon passage through the lung atrial peptides may undergo metabolic degradation that alters their pulmonary vasodilator activities.", 
    "247": "A rapid and highly efficient procedure for purification of kininase II from human seminal plasma is described. After ultracentrifugation, the enzyme was purified by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B CL and ion exchange chromatography followed by affinity chromatography of EDTA-inhibited enzyme on bradykinin-Sepharose. The enzyme was specifically inhibited by Captopril and BPP9a but not by phosphoamidon. PAGE in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate under reducing conditions resulted in two major protein bands with apparent molecular masses of about 55 kDa and 65 kDa and two faint protein bands at higher molecular masses. Antibodies raised against the major protein bands showed full cross reactivity with all four protein bands. The presented data indicate that kininase II of subunits.", 
    "248": "We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study using 12 subjects to determine the effects of a single 50-mg dose of captopril on the response to nasal challenge with increasing doses of allergen. Levels of kinins, histamine and N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME)-esterase activity were measured in nasal lavages, and symptom scores and the number of sneezes were recorded. Captopril had no significant effects on histamine, TAME-esterase, sneezing or symptom scores. Peak postchallenge kinin levels, however, were significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) compared to placebo, while an increase in the magnitude of the dose-response curve was of marginal significance (p = 0.058). Thus, captopril causes increases in the kinin levels in nasal secretions during the allergic response. If increased kinin levels persist or worsen with chronic therapy, it is possible that they could exacerbate allergic symptoms during repeated seasonal exposure.", 
    "249": "The pressure-natriuresis relationships in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were characterized with or without intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. The pressure-natriuresis relationship in SHR was shifted toward higher pressure in comparison to WKY. The inhibition of intrarenal RAS by MK-422 (0.3 ug/kg/min) in SHR enabled to excrete more sodium at the same pressure (P less than 0.05), whereas no significant changes were observed in WKY. In SHR, during administration of Thi5,8, D-Phe7-bradykinin (50 micrograms/kg/min), the natriuretic responses to MK-422 were maintained. Intrarenal infusion of Sar1, Ile8-angiotensin (70 ng/kg/min) into SHR increased sodium excretion accompanied by an increase in renal plasma flow. Intrarenally administered angiotensin I (10 ng/kg/min) into WKY showed antinatriuretic effects with minimal changes in renal hemodynamics. These results indicate that alteration of intrarenal RAS in SHR might contribute to reset the pressure-natriuresis relationship.", 
    "250": "A method for determination of the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the hypothalamus and hypophysis of the rat was provided. Membrane-bound enzyme was extracted from tissues by twice homogenization and centrifugation after solubilization of membrane structures with the detergent triton X-100. Protein concentrations of tissue extracts and time of incubation, at which there was linear generation of dipeptid his-lev in the course of the enzymic reaction as at the same time its degradation from tissue peptidases was under 10%, were between 0.16 and 0.35 mg/ml for the hypothalamus and between 0.07 and 0.18 mg/ml for the hypophysis with duration of incubation between 15 and 30 min. Under these conditions the enzymic activity was determined by a substrate-fal-his-lev, amounting to 18.22%-1.3 and 96.22-42 nmol/min/mg of protein (x-SEM) for the hypothalamus (n = 18) and hypophysis (n = 30) respectively. The coefficients of variation of the enzymic analysis were determined for a series in a day (1.37%) and for a series in time (9.59%). Hydrolyzing activity synonymously identified as ACE was differentiated from other tissue peptidildipeptide hydrolases by the following three criteria: hydrolyzing activity in respect to the specific for ACE artificial substrates; activation of enzymic action by Cl-; inhibition of the activity by converting inhibitors captopryl and MK 422 as well as by the helatic agent EDTA-Na2.", 
    "251": "An intravenous injection of kallikrein produced hypotensive and thrombolytic effects in anesthetized cats, using the blood superfused tendon technique. The thrombolytic action of kallikrein was mediated by an unstable substance. The generation of this substance was abolished by either acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or aprotonin and enhanced by captopril. The hypotensive action of kallikrein was only partially inhibited by ASA. It is proposed that both these pharmacological effects of kallikrein are mediated by bradykinin which in turn releases prostacyclin from the endothelium. However, in contrast to the thrombolytic effect of kallikrein which is totally mediated by prostacyclin the hypotensive action of kallikrein depends not only on prostacyclin but also on another endothelium-derived vasorelaxant, e.g. EDRF.", 
    "252": "Hypertension is a major disease in the black population of sub-Saharan Africa and the U.S. The prevalence of hypertension varies from 1-30% of the adult population. Differences in blood pressure (BP) between black and white patients have been documented. In this review, genetic, endocrine, and environmental characteristics, renal physiology, and cardiac function are reviewed. Racial differences in renal physiology and socioeconomic status seem to account for BP differences. Black hypertensive patients in sub-Saharan Africa are prone to cerebral hemorrhage, malignant hypertension leading to uremia, and congestive heart failure, whereas coronary artery disease is uncommon. Responses to hypotensive agents like beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are poor unless these agents are combined with a thiazide diuretic. Black hypertensive patients respond best to diuretics, vasodilators, or calcium channel blockers. A profiled approach to the treatment of hypertension is suggested.", 
    "253": "Many hormonal systems are involved in salt homeostasis and blood pressure control, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the kallikrein-kinin system, and atrial and brain natriuretic peptides. Many of these hormonal peptides have actions both in the central nervous system and the periphery that are complementary. There is also increasing evidence that many of them may act as both circulating endocrine systems as well as local paracrine autocrine systems. The atrial natriuretic peptides may be viewed as endogenous inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and renin inhibitors have provided important information on the role of the renin-angiotensin system in physiological and pathophysiologic states. The development of specific atriopeptidase inhibitors, kinin antagonists, and kallikrein inhibitors offer the same promise for these systems.", 
    "254": "The clinical characteristics of the 4,170 hypertensive patients referred to the Dunedin Clinic from 1950 to 1989 have been compared for eight successive 5-year periods. A gradual decrease in the severity of referred hypertension and an increase in the proportion of patients already on treatment at the time of referral (currently 50%) were noted. For male patients, mean +/- SD initial lying blood pressure was 179 +/- 27/116 +/- 19 mm Hg in 1950-1954 and 158 +/- 25/91 +/- 14 mm Hg in 1985-1989. Corresponding prevalence data for target organ damage among male patients were retinal grade 3 or 4, 49% and 3%; cardiomegaly on chest radiograph, 60% and 26%; electrocardiogram left ventricle strain pattern, 28% and 3%; and serum urea levels greater than 10 mmol/L, 16% and 5%, respectively. For women there was a similar trend. The number of patients on drugs in each of nine categories and the percent use of each drug category for each year during 1950-1989 was recovered from computerized data files. The percentage peak usage of ganglion blockers was in 1950-1958, adrenergic neuron blockers in 1963-1970, centrally acting drugs in 1965-1968, diuretics in 1960-1982, beta-blockers in 1974-1987, alpha-blockers in 1980-1987, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists in 1989. The diuretics have been the most enduring drugs, followed by the beta-blockers.", 
    "255": "The evolution of antihypertensive drug use in the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic between 1969 and 1986 was determined, from computerized data, by extracting percentages of new patients prescribed different drugs at their first clinic visit. Prescribing of adrenergic neuron blockers and centrally acting drugs (methyldopa and clonidine) was common in the early years but declined rapidly until, after 1975 and 1980, respectively, it remained at 10% or less. Diuretics, mainly thiazides, were prescribed for 20% of patients in 1969 to a peak of 55% in 1980. beta-Blockers were first used during the early 1970s and their use peaked in 1980, when they were prescribed for over 60% of new patients. They remained a first-choice treatment in more than 40% of patients. Calcium channel blockers were first used in 1980 and by 1986 were prescribed for 15% of new patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used from 1982 and in 1986 were prescribed for 7% of new patients. These two classes of drugs are more expensive than older drugs. However, because of their low usage, this did not greatly influence treatment costs up to 1986, as beta-blockers and thiazides remained widely used.", 
    "256": "The renin-angiotensin system has been shown to have an effect on erythropoietin synthesis and hemoglobin concentration. We present a retrospective study of stable renal transplant recipients who received an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as treatment of hypertension. Fifteen patients were eligible, with a mean hemoglobin concentration of 130.7 +/- 22.7 g/L (SD). Within 6 months of ACE-inhibitor therapy, the mean hemoglobin had fallen significantly to 110.5 +/- 23.2 g/L (p less than 0.001). No parallel change in leukocyte or platelet counts was evident. Prospective studies are needed to clarify the effect of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system on erythropoietin synthesis and release.", 
    "257": "Antihypertensive therapy reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with malignant hypertension, but has not yet been shown to reduce risk in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The lack of significant coronary prevention in the latter group, in large-scale trials, may have resulted from methodologic problems, statistical limitations, the adverse effects of antihypertensive medications, or failure to recognize the prognostic importance of concomitant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. To date, primary prevention studies have focused on the use of beta-blockers and diuretics, both of which may have adverse metabolic effects and neither of which is capable of modifying left ventricular hypertrophy. Future research should be directed toward evaluating coronary prevention in patients with nonmalignant hypertension who have been treated with newer agents, such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, each of which has been shown to regress left ventricular hypertrophy and not to have adverse metabolic effects.", 
    "258": "The antihypertensive efficacy of sustained-release diltiazem 300 mg at a single daily dose was evaluated and compared to that of enalapril 20 mg at a single daily dose, and to a combination therapy of enalapril 20 mg with sustained-release diltiazem 300 mg in patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 115 mm Hg). After a washout period and a placebo period, each lasting 2 weeks, 96 patients were randomized in this double-blind study to three parallel groups that were treated for 28 days. In the groups treated with diltiazem, enalapril, or the combination of both, the drop in arterial blood pressure was 20, 11, and 19 mm Hg for supine diastolic blood pressure (supine DBP): 18, 12, and 19 mm Hg for standing diastolic blood pressure (standing DBP); 22, 20, and 23 mm Hg for supine systolic blood pressure (supine SBP); and 21, 19, and 24 mm Hg for standing systolic blood pressure (standing SBP), respectively. The reduction in DBP was significantly more pronounced in the group treated with sustained-release diltiazem 300 mg than in the group treated with enalapril 20 mg. Cardiac tolerance was good for patients treated with sustained-release diltiazem 300 mg alone or the combination therapy: no orthostatic hypotension or lengthening of the PR interval in the electrocardiogram was observed. Although side effects of sustained-release diltiazem 300 mg occurred more frequently, they were not severe and disappeared immediately when treatment was suspended.", 
    "259": "It has been recognized recently that even minor elevations in blood pressure contribute to progression of renal failure and that antihypertensive treatment retards progression. Despite suggestive experimental data, no unequivocal clinical evidence is available to date to document that converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) are superior to alternative antihypertensive agents with respect to halting progression. CEIs undoubtedly reduce albuminuria, independent of their effect on systemic blood pressure, and this is related to alteration of glomerular permselectivity. Recent experimental data suggest that growth processes in damaged kidneys are an important aspect of progression. It is a fascinating perspective, but yet unproven, that CEIs interfere with these processes.", 
    "260": "The purpose of this study was to determine if conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Ang II) within the kidney is important in the control of renal function following sodium depletion. Infusion of a short-acting angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, BPP5a, into the left kidney at a dose of 30 micrograms/kg/min failed to alter significantly the pressor response to Ang I administered in a femoral vein. Mean arterial pressure and renal function in the contralateral noninfused kidney also remained unchanged to intrarenal infusion of the ACE inhibitor into the left kidney. Thus, the ACE inhibitor used in these studies can be effectively localized to the renal circulation when infused intrarenally at 30 micrograms/kg/min. Intrarenal infusion of the ACE inhibitor at 30 micrograms/kg/min into sodium-restricted dogs failed to alter renal blood flow (RBF) significantly. However, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine volume, and sodium excretion all increased significantly in response to intrarenal ACE inhibition. Intrarenal Ang II generation therefore appears to play a physiologically important role in the control of GFR, urine volume, and sodium excretion but not RBF following sodium depletion. The increase in GFR following intrarenal infusion of the ACE inhibitor may suggest that Ang II is formed mainly at glomerular or preglomerular sites.", 
    "261": "The purpose of this study was to compare the acute hypotensive efficacy of different types of inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system. A renin inhibitor (RI), CGP 44,099 A, a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), enalaprilat, a peptidic angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist, [Sar1, Ile8]Ang II (P-Ang IIA), and a nonpeptidic Ang II antagonist devoid of agonistic properties, 2-butyl-4-chloro-1- ([2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl)-5- (hydroxymethyl)imidazol (NP-Ang IIA), were administered intravenously to sodium-depleted rats (SDRs), renal hypertensive rats (two-kidney, one-clip) (RHRs), and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The four compounds were all effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) in SDRs and RHRs. The maximum hypotensive response observed within 30 min of administration was similar for all four compounds (approximately 30 mm Hg in SDRs and 60 mm Hg in RHRs). In SHRs, the P-Ang IIA induced a pressor response whereas the RI, CEI, and NP-Ang IIA lowered BP to a similar extent (approximately 15 mm Hg). Pretreatment with the CEI completely prevented the hypotensive response to RI in SHRs, and vice versa. These observations indicate that the principal mechanism by which converting enzyme inhibitors lower BP after acute administration in these rat models is by inhibition of the formation of Ang II. The pressor response to the P-Ang IIA in SHRs is probably a consequence of its partial agonistic properties. Renin inhibitors and nonpeptidic Ang II antagonists, devoid of agonistic properties, promise to be effective antihypertensive agents similar to the CEIs.",

In vivo, this compound is a very potent, Ang II-specific antagonist with a very long duration of action against Ang II-induced blood pressure (BP) increases. In the \"low-sodium\" dog, this compound induces a prolonged BP reduction during and after intravenous infusion at doses comparable to cilazapril, a potent ACE inhibitor. The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic behavior of this peptide was therefore assessed to understand and interpret the prolonged antagonistic and antihypertensive activity of this peptide. Binding studies using beef adrenocortical membranes indicated specific binding of Br5Ang and related analogues to Ang II receptors with a Kd of 1.41 x 10(-9) M against iodinated [Sar1, D-Phe8]Ang II, a standard radioligand antagonist. Iodinated Br5AngII exhibited a very high degree of nonspecific binding to the membranes. It had an octanol-water partitioning coefficient of log P of + 0.903, a coefficient 84-fold higher than for [125I][Sar1, D-Phe8]Ang II. Association kinetics of [125I]Br5Ang II were similar to the standard ligand [125I] [Sar1, D-Phe8]Ang II, but the half-life of dissociation was four times higher (60 vs. 15 min at 20 degrees C). Molecular modeling indicates a practically identical conformational behavior of both peptides, Br5Ang II and [Sar1, D-Phe8]Ang II but with an expanded hydration shell over the Br5 residue. It is concluded that the prolonged duration of action is due to the increased hydrophobicity of the peptide, which leads to a slow dissociation from the Ang II receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "263": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and formation of extracellular matrix in the intima of muscular arteries are major processes that can lead to vascular stenosis in arteriosclerosis or after coronary angioplasty. These processes are also seen in the proliferative response to balloon catheter-induced vascular injury of the rat carotid artery, and result in marked neointima formation by 14 days after catheterization. We have shown recently that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril strongly suppressed this development of neointima. In this report, we show that the beneficial effects on neointima formation persist for at least 8 weeks after stopping treatment with cilazapril, and that continuous treatment may have additional inhibitory effects during the late phases of vascular remodeling after injury. To investigate further the possible mechanisms, we examined several vasoactive compounds in this model. Another ACE inhibitor of a different chemical class, captopril, reduced neointima formation as strongly as cilazapril (67 and 78%, respectively), but the calcium antagonist verapamil was not active as an inhibitor of neointima formation, despite similar lowering of blood pressure. Hydralazine and a new calcium antagonist, Ro 40-5967, partially suppressed neointima formation (36%, p less than 0.005 and 33%, p less than 0.05, respectively). In vitro, neither cilazapril nor its active metabolite, cilazaprilate, had any effect on SMC proliferation in response to serum or PDGF. To characterize further the role of angiotensin II (Ang II), we tested in cell culture the effects of Ang II and cilazaprilate on mRNA levels of several proteins potentially involved in regulating the SMC response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "264": "Structure-activity studies of angiotensin II (Ang II) have clearly established that the carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine is crucial for activation of angiotensin receptors associated with a broad range of effects including vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, and dipsogenesis. Thus, the heptapeptide angiotensin-[1-7] (Ang-[1-7]) has been classified as an inactive metabolite of the hormone Ang II. This assumption was seriously questioned in light of the report from our laboratory that Ang-[1-7] is the major metabolite of dog brainstem homogenates both in the absence and in the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These data raised the possibility of a functional role for Ang-[1-7] in the brain. Subsequent studies in the in vitro hypothalamoneurohypophysial system of the rat demonstrated that Ang-[1-7] is equipotent with Ang II in its activation of AVP release. Other Ang II-like actions have since been identified for Ang-[1-7] in the brain. For example, microinjection of Ang-[1-7] into brainstem nuclei of the rat promotes bradycardia and hypotension; in addition, Ang-[1-7] mimics the effect of Ang II in augmenting the intrinsic discharge rate of neurons within the vagal-solitary complex of the dog. Our laboratory has also provided evidence for synthesis and storage of Ang-[1-7] in the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "265": "Differential solute clearances were used to examine the effects of a 90-day course of enalapril on glomerular barrier function in 16 proteinuric patients with diabetic glomerulopathy. By day 90, plasma renin and prorenin became elevated, and arterial pressure declined. Transglomerular passage of dextrans of broad size distribution (radii 28-60 A) was lowered significantly. In a subset of 8 patients, withdrawal of enalapril was followed after an additional 30 days by a return of renin levels and arterial pressure to pretreatment levels. The dextran-sieving profile also returned to baseline, becoming uniformly elevated above treated day-90 levels. A theoretical analysis of the serial dextran-sieving profiles indicated that enalapril shifted glomerular pore size distribution to smaller size. These changes in barrier size selectivity were associated with a reduction in fractional albumin and IgG clearances during enalapril therapy and a subsequent rise in these quantities after its withdrawal; urinary protein excretion rate tended to vary in parallel. We conclude that inhibition of converting enzyme in humans with established diabetic glomerulopathy diminishes glomerular permeability to proteins by enhancing barrier size selectivity. Because neither enalapril therapy nor its withdrawal influenced the glomerular filtration or renal plasma flow rates significantly, we propose that the primary action of enalapril may be to modulate the intrinsic membrane properties of the glomerular barrier.", 
    "266": "Local inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II) produces both attenuation of angiotensin (Ang) II generation and bradykinin (BK) degradation. To delineate the participation of BK in the cardioprotective actions of ACE inhibitors, experiments were performed in rats and dogs with cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injuries. (I) In rat isolated perfused working hearts with regional myocardial ischemia, BK in concentrations as low as 1 X 10(-9) M increased coronary flow (CF) and reduced the incidence and duration of reperfusion ventricular fibrillation (VF). In addition, enzyme activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase as well as lactate output were decreased in the venous effluent of BK-perfused hearts, which also showed improved cardiodynamic and metabolic parameters. Even concentrations of BK lower than 1 X 10(-10) M, which were without influence on coronary flow, exerted comparable beneficial metabolic effects connected with reduced incidence and duration of VF. Combined perfusions with threshold concentrations of BK (1 X 10(-12) M) and the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat (2.58 X 10(-9) M), which were ineffective given alone, resulted in a marked cardioprotective effect. Perfusion with Ang II (1 X 10(-9) M) aggravated reperfusion arrhythmias and worsened myocardial metabolism. BK perfusion prevented this deterioration in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the Ang II receptor antagonist saralasin was only marginally effective. The BK antagonist D-Arg-[Hyp2, Thi5,8, D-Phe7]-BK (1 X 10(-5) M) completely abolished the cardioprotective effects of BK or the ACE inhibitor. However, higher concentrations of BK (1 X 10(-7) M) or ramiprilat (2.58 X 10(-5) M) competitively reversed these properties of the BK antagonist. (II) In anesthetized dogs, BK was infused into the coronary artery in a dose of 1 ng/kg/min during occlusion (90 min) and reperfusion (30 min) of the left descending coronary artery (LAD)--a dose without effects on cardiovascular parameters. In line with the findings in isolated ischemic rat hearts, BK infusion reduced LDH activities and lactate concentrations in the coronary sinus blood, whereas myocardial tissue levels of glycogen and energy-rich phosphates were increased in the infarcted area. The cardioprotective effects produced by perfusion with BK or by reduction of BK degradation through local interference with ACE favor a role for BK in ischemia-reperfusion injuries in rats and dogs.", 
    "267": "The antihypertensive effect of inhibitors of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE = kininase II) results from their vasodilatory and natriuretic effects as well as their effect on baroreceptor function. In addition to the inhibition of systemic and local angiotensin II formation, other local hormonal systems may also be involved in this effect at multiple target sites. Thus, potentiation of the vasodilator and natriuretic kinin system following inhibition of kininase II is thought to contribute to the persistent hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitors despite normalization of circulating ACE activity. Although increased plasma bradykinin levels cannot be detected, we found that the enhanced kinin-dependent local vascular prostacyclin production can be blunted in vitro by aprotinin, a kallikrein inhibitor. ACE inhibition may affect the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system as the renin-angiotensin system and ANP appear to play antagonistic roles at the peripheral and central nervous system levels. Inhibition of kallikrein or of kininase II were both shown to modulate the natriuretic and vasorelaxant effects of ANP. In hypertensive subjects, we found that ACE inhibition with blood pressure normalization reduces basal and stimulated plasma ANP and blunts the renal sodium excretion in response to saline loading. In contrast, we did not observe effects of acute ACE inhibition in healthy sodium-depleted volunteers on plasma vasopressin under basal conditions or in response to passive tilt. Finally, we investigated the interaction of ACE inhibition with substance P, a powerful endogenous diuretic and natriuretic peptide that may have a transmitter function in the baroreceptor reflex arch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "268": "The role of plasma kinin in the hypotensive mechanism of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in essential hypertensive patients and in a dog myocardiac ischemic model is discussed. Both an increase in plasma kinin and a decrease in plasma angiotensin II might contribute to the hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors in a normal-renin group. In a low-renin group, the hypotensive mechanism of this drug may be mainly the increase in plasma kinin levels. The augmentation of urine volume and urinary sodium excretion may also be related to the hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors, and this mechanism might be explained by the renal blood flow increase and augmented activity in the renal kallikrein-kinin system. In a dog myocardial ischemia model, when an apparent myocardial ischemia occurred in the constricted group, plasma kinin levels in coronary sinus blood increased significantly. Following infusion of kinin into the left main coronary artery, 0.1 ng/kg/min of kinin for 5 min did not cause any change in plasma kinin levels in the artery or coronary sinus. A dose of 10 ng/kg/min of kinin for 5 min produced a significant elevation in plasma kinin in the coronary sinus from 12.8 to 142 pg/ml without any change in plasma kinin in the artery. However, such a level of kinin had no significant effect on coronary circulation, myocardial metabolism, or ECG ST segment in either group. Thus, the role of increased kinin in this dog model still remains unclear. Further studies including the administration of ACE inhibitors or bradykinin antagonist will be necessary to reach conclusions about the role of kinin in the heart.", 
    "269": "The present study was undertaken to assess in unanesthetized rats the effect of a kinin antagonist (D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-Phe-Thi-Arg-trifluoroacetic acid) on blood pressure, heart rate, and splanchnic nerve activity. The antagonist infused intra-arterially (50 micrograms/min) for 10 min had no blood pressure effect in control rats. It did, however, cause a significant increase in blood pressure in animals preinfused with a nonpressor dose of angiotensin II (1 ng/min i.v.) for 70 min. The antagonist-induced blood pressure rise was not associated with an increase in splanchnic nerve activity. Acute angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril (2.5 mg i.v.) had no influence on the pressor response to the kinin antagonist in angiotensin II-treated rats. These results obtained in conscious normotensive rats suggest that endogenous kinins participate in the control of blood pressure by attenuating the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II. The involvement of kinin does not seem to be enhanced by acute ACE inhibition.", 
    "270": "Inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE = kininase II) by definition have a dual action: prevention of angiotensin II generation and inhibition of kinin degradation. Although the first mechanism is generally accepted, it may not by itself be sufficient to explain the acute blood pressure-lowering action of these compounds. Studies in experimental and clinical hypertension, including the use of selective angiotensin II and bradykinin receptor antagonists, suggest additional vasodilator, non-renin-dependent mechanisms in their action on blood flow and blood pressure. Inhibition of kinin degradation by ACE inhibitors will amplify kinin-mediated reactions on local vessel tone, in particular, if kinin generation is stimulated or this situation is experimentally mimicked by addition of exogenous bradykinin. The acute blood pressure-lowering action of ACE inhibitors is inhibited by indomethacin-type cyclooxygenase inhibitors, suggesting a contribution of bradykinin-induced release of vasodilator prostaglandins to their action. Bradykinin stimulates the phospholipase-dependent release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, allowing for subsequent generation of its metabolites, the eicosanoids. This stimulation is receptor-mediated and involves one or more types of B2 receptors, coupled via G-proteins to intracellular messenger systems that control cytosolic calcium levels. Bradykinin-induced changes in vessel tone are transient, caused by a rapidly developing tachyphylaxis at the receptor level. The potent vasodilator action of systemic bradykinin administration is not consistently reflected in studies performed on isolated blood vessels. This is probably due to the indirect nature of kinin-mediated vasomotor responses, i.e., the release of vasoactive mediators, most notably the eicosanoids and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "271": "In our studies, we investigated the vasodepressor effects of bradykinin in vivo in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Bradykinin was injected intravenously and intra-arterially (40-6,050 pM/kg) and was infused intra-arterially (40-6,050 pM/kg/min). The investigations were performed in 21 normotensive and 15 hypertensive patients. Bradykinin injections were performed after the following pharmacological interventions: salt restriction (10 mmol of Na/day), salt loading (300 mmol of Na/day), captopril (50 mg), ramipril (5 mg), lisinopril (20 mg), ketotifen (2 X 1 mg), indomethacin (2 X 50 mg), and propranolol (80 mg). The results show that bradykinin lowers blood pressure in a dose-related manner by marked reduction in peripheral vascular resistance. The blood pressure reduction was strongly correlated with the increase in kinin concentration. This effect of bradykinin appears to be independent of changes in sodium metabolism, beta-adrenoceptors, histamine-1 receptors, and prostaglandins. ACE inhibitors protentiate the blood pressure-lowering effect of bradykinin approximately 20- to 50-fold. In the case of intra-arterial injection of bradykinin, only 2-5% of the intravenously used dose of bradykinin are needed to produce an identical fall in blood pressure. From these experiments, a pulmonary clearance rate of bradykinin of over 95% can be calculated. In the pulmonary arteries, bradykinin has no effect on vascular resistance. In patients suffering from primary or renovascular hypertension, the blood pressure response to bradykinin was enhanced. The bradykinin potentiating effect of the ACE inhibitors was not altered in the hypertensives. In patients suffering from borderline hypertension or primary hyperaldosteronism, bradykinin caused the same blood pressure lowering effect as in the normotensives.", 
    "272": "Neurokinins, bradykinin and angiotensins were tested in isolated urinary bladder of the guinea pig, the hamster and the rat, in the absence and in presence of a variety of peptidase inhibitors in order to establish if peptide degradation interferes with the bladder contractions elicited by the three types of peptides. Indeed, the effects of neurokinins, bradykinin and angiotensin I in the guinea pig bladder were significantly enhanced by captopril (4.6 x 10(-6) mol/l), chymostatin (1 mg/l), phosphoramidon (4.6 x 10(-6) mol/l) and thiorphan (1.0 x 10(-6) mol/l), while only captopril was found to potentiate the effects of the same peptides in the rat bladder. The four peptidase inhibitors, as well as bacitracin were found to modify the responses of the hamster urinary bladder to one or another or to all three groups of peptides and to DiMeC7. The present results suggest that the urinary bladders of various species have different types of active proteolytic enzymes: only the angiotensin-converting enzyme appears to be present in the rat bladder, while the same enzyme and possibly two additional endopeptidases interfere with the myotropic effects of neurokinins, kinins and angiotensins in the guinea pig and the hamster bladder.", 
    "273": "Myotropic effects of various peptides were measured in three isolated vessels, the dog carotid artery, the rabbit pulmonary artery and the rat portal vein in the absence and in presence of several peptidase inhibitors, in order to evaluate the interference by metabolism with the peptides' biological activities. After adequate controls, captopril (4.6 x 10(-6) mol/l), thiorphan (1.0 x 10(-6) mol/l), phosphoramidon (4.6 x 10(-6) mol/l), chymostatin (1 mg/l), bestatin (8.1 x 10(-6) mol/l) or bacitracin (1.4 x 10(-5) mol/l) were left in contact with the tissues for 20-40 min to inhibit tissue peptidases before measuring again the biological effects of the various peptides. In some experiments, mergetpa (5.4 x 10(-6) mol/l) was used. All peptidase inhibitors were inactive on their own and only captopril potentiated the effects of substance P, neurokinins, bradykinin and inhibited angiotensin I in two preparations, the dog carotid artery, the rat portal vein, and, excluding bradykinin, also in the rabbit pulmonary artery. Captopril and thiorphan significantly potentiated the maximal response of the rat portal vein to substance P and mergetpa inhibited completely the effect of bradykinin on the rabbit pulmonary artery. The present findings suggest that the most active proteolytic enzyme interfering with the biological effects of vasoactive peptides on three isolated vessels is the angiotensin-converting enzyme (kininase II).", 
    "274": "A study was performed to investigate if oral dosing of captopril could influence the development of atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed cynomolgus monkeys. Twenty-four monkeys were divided into four groups: (a) a control group given a normal monkey diet and placebo medication; (b) a high cholesterol group given a high cholesterol diet and placebo medication; (c) a low-dose captopril group given the cholesterol diet and 25 mg/kg of captopril twice daily; and (d) a high-dose captopril group given the cholesterol diet and 50 mg/kg of captopril twice daily. The doses of captopril used in this study did not change the levels of total serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or triglycerides. The total cholesterol/HDL ratio was also unaffected by captopril. The animals were killed after 6 months of treatment. The progression of atherosclerosis was assessed by gross pathology, histopathology, and biochemical methods. The results showed a significantly reduced progression of arterial lesions in monkeys given captopril; the effects of captopril were most evident in the coronary arteries, which were practically free from atherosclerosis in captopril-treated animals.", 
    "275": "In a recent study in which metabolic characteristics of newly detected obese and nonobese hypertensive subjects were compared with those of normotensive subjects, insulin sensitivity was decreased, fasting insulin values and insulin values after an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were increased, and fasting and IVGTT glucose values were increased in both hypertensive groups. Furthermore, adverse alterations in lipid profile variables were found in the hypertensive groups when compared with the normotensive group. The effects of various antihypertensive agents on these metabolic variables have been assessed in prospective trials. Treatment with the beta 1-selective blocking agents metoprolol and atenolol was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and increased fasting values of insulin and glucose. There were also indications of a suppressive effect on insulin secretion during IVGTT, as well as an increase in serum triglycerides and a decrease in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Hydrochlorothiazide treatment was associated with a decrease in insulin sensitivity and an increase in blood glucose concentrations. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide increased total cholesterol, particularly the low-density lipoprotein fraction. The calcium channel blocker diltiazem did not appear to produce any negative metabolic effects. Treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril resulted in increased insulin sensitivity with no adverse effects on lipids. All of the agents reduced blood pressure to a similar degree. These findings, and those of other studies, suggest that captopril and diltiazem offer advantages over the other agents with regard to effects on risk factors for coronary artery disease other than hypertension. Unlike diltiazem, captopril improves insulin sensitivity and this may prove to be important.", 
    "276": "Mortality resulting from coronary artery disease and sudden death has not been significantly reduced by the use of antihypertensive medications in patients with hypertension, despite evidence that hypertension is a major risk factor for myocardial infarction. One possible reason is that the drugs used may have adverse metabolic effects that negate the beneficial effect of lowering blood pressure. Diuretics and beta-blocking agents produce a wide range of biochemical or metabolic alterations-e.g., changes in plasma potassium and in lipoprotein profiles. In general, fewer or less marked alterations are associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha-adrenergic blockers, and slow calcium channel blocking drugs. The effects of these agents alone and in combination and their potential relationship with coronary adverse events are reviewed. Although the clinical relevance of these alterations has yet to be fully determined, it is rational to suggest that given or current knowledge, the antihypertensive agent selected for use should be an effective, well-tolerated drug with a minimum of adverse biochemical or metabolic effects.", 
    "277": "Hypertension is one of the primary risk factors for cardiovascular disease, especially coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease, and congestive heart failure. Recent analysis of the numerous prospective clinical trials of the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy performed during the past quarter century has shown that active treatment reduces mortality and cerebrovascular disease but has not prevented CAD. The reason for this paradox--that lowering blood pressure does not reduce CAD mortality or morbidity--is uncertain. During the past several years, it has become clear that hyperinsulinemia and peripheral insulin resistance constitute the link between hypertension, obesity, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, three conditions in which the rate of CAD is very high. Other studies have shown that hyperinsulinemia is a potent cardiovascular risk factor. Epidemiologic surveys and retrospective reviews of clinical experience have pointed out the surprising fact that when hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus occur in the same patient, hypertension is likely to be diagnosed first and the risk of developing diabetes is much higher if antihypertensive drugs (thiazide diuretics or beta-adrenoreceptor blockers) were given. Recently, careful studies have shown that both thiazide diuretic and beta-adrenoreceptor blockers worsen insulin sensitivity, whereas angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril) and peripheral alpha 1-blockers (prazosin) improve it and also favorably affect the levels of other atherogenic risk factors. Although it is too early to be certain, this information suggests that, pending the results of long-term clinical trials that measure clinical events, treatment of hypertension might be better able to reduce CAD if it were directed at improving insulin sensitivity. Nonpharmacologic measures that reduce hyperinsulinemia, weight loss, and exercise should be vigorously recommended, and pharmacologic therapy should be aimed at avoiding drugs that worsen insulin sensitivity, as long as blood pressure is successfully reduced.", 
    "278": "In 8 healthy normotensive probands with normal glomerular filtration rate, the effect of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on inulin clearance (Cin) was examined in an open study with intraindividual crossover with or without enalapril pretreatment (20 mg/day). rhGH was administered by subcutaneous injection (4.5 U twice daly) for 3 days. On the following day Cin was measured with an enzymatic steady state infusion technique. Systemic hemodynamics and potential metabolic effects of rhGH, i.e., inulin-like growth factors I and II, somatomedin-binding protein, glucagon, C peptide, amino acid pattern, etc., were monitored. On controlled dietary intake of protein, the median Cin rose 72 h after start of rhGh administration from 114 (range 91-158) to 135 (108-167) ml/min/1.73 m2 without enalapril pretreatment (p less than 0.01) and from 111 (88-153) to 131 (100-173 ml/min/1.73 m2 with enalapril pretreatment (p less than 0.02). The results confirm that (1) rhGH increases Cin to a similar extent as extractive GH and (2) further demonstrate that this action is not obliterated by blocking the circulating converting enzyme.", 
    "279": "This study examined the ability of tissue kallikreins, purified from both rat submandibular gland (SMG) and human urine, to form angiotensin II from synthetic angiotensin I. Both kallikreins converted angiotensin I to angiotensin II at neutral pH with the following kinetic constants: SMG kallikrein, Km = 9.43 x 10(-5) mol/l, Kcat = 1.58 mumols/mg protein/min; human urinary kallikrein, Km = 1.71 x 10(-4) mol/l, Kcat = 0.06 mumol/mg protein/min. These activities were not affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. These results suggest that tissue kallikrein might participate in the formation of angiotensin II during administration of an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "280": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a complex clinical syndrome affecting 1% of the U.S. population. The basic dysfunction, a lack of sufficient blood flow to the periphery, triggers reflex neurohumoral mechanisms that cause systemic vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention as the body attempts to protect vital organs. This, in turn, results in additional work for the failing heart and further deterioration. Vasodilators, in general, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in particular, interrupt this pathophysiology and improve hemodynamics. Enalapril, a long-acting ACE inhibitor, has been demonstrated to improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, maximum oxygen uptake, and exercise tolerance in CHF patients. Data from a recent trial provide evidence that a group of patients with severe CHF who were treated with enalapril showed reduced heart size, reduced need for other heart-failure medication, and reduced mortality.", 
    "281": "Enalapril is an effective agent in the treatment of mild to severe hypertension. It is equally effective in elderly and young adult patients but appears to be more effective in white than in black hypertensive patients. Following treatment with enalapril, an assessment of maximum exercise performance found a decrease in total peripheral resistance without significant changes in cardiac output, heart rate, or stroke volume compared with pretreatment values. In addition, there have been reports of reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy in enalapril-treated hypertensive patients. Enalapril is also effective and well tolerated in hypertensive patients with renal impairment of varying etiology. The most common adverse experiences reported in controlled clinical trials were headache (5.2%), dizziness (4.3%), and fatigue (3.0%). In high-risk hypertensive patients, no enalapril-treated neutropenia, proteinuria, dysgeusia, or ageusia were reported. It may be concluded that the benefit-to-risk ratio of enalapril is among the best of the antihypertensive therapies currently available.", 
    "282": "Patient compliance is crucial to successful medical treatment. Many factors contribute to compliance, including age, sex, other sociodemographic factors, finances, intelligence, complexity of therapeutic regimen, and patient-physician rapport. Compliance is especially critical in medical conditions requiring prolonged therapy, such as hypertension. Historically, compliance among hypertensive patients has been alarmingly poor, with a 50% drop-off after 1 year and fewer than 20% still in therapy after 5 years. The use of enalapril, the long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that allows for a once-daily regimen, has improved treatment success and compliance. This probably is due to the efficacy of the drug, coupled with a low incidence of side effects.", 
    "283": "There have been many changes in the treatment of hypertension over the past few decades. The Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) has published four reports since 1977. The first three highlighted diuretic therapy as the main ingredient of stepped care for hypertensive patients. In the fourth report, this position has been revised to a patient-oriented, or individualized, approach. The shift reflects the results of many studies on hypertensive patients treated with a variety of approaches and drugs, including diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, sympatholytics, and calcium channel blockers. After analyzing the patient's history, physical, and laboratory findings, the report recommends making choices from the various agents, based on patient demographics, sequelae, concomitant diseases, and other risk factors such as cholesterol levels.", 
    "284": "Recent studies in animal models suggest that glomerular capillary hyperperfusion and hypertension, rather than ischemia, cause renal injury. Interventions that control glomerular capillary hypertension may protect against progressive injury, even in the presence of continued systemic hypertension. In the absence of systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus is a prominent clinical example of glomerular hypertension. Animal studies have shown that glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities, especially elevations in glomerular pressure, play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerulopathy. A number of clinical observations suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy by their effects on renal hemodynamics. In experimental animals, comparisons between calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors have shown the latter to be more effective in protecting the kidneys. Preliminary clinical studies indicate that ACE inhibitors may have advantages in preserving renal function in hypertensive and diabetic patients with renal failure.", 
    "285": "In recent years, the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the development of hypertension has been investigated extensively. Studies have shown that there are actually two systems: a tissue and a circulating RAS. The control of hypertension is focused primarily in the RAS in the cardiovascular system and the brain. By manipulating the RAS with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, researchers have learned that the cardiovascular neuronal centers in the brain have receptor sites for the actions of angiotensin II (Ang II). Receptors for Ang II are found in the medulla oblongata in neurons involved in the regulation of baroceptor activity. Since studies in both animals and hypertensive patients indicate that ACE inhibitors reduced sympathetic activity and enhanced baroceptor sensitivity, it is possible that the primary hypotensive mechanism of these agents is through blockage of Ang II formation in the cardiovascular centers of the brain.", 
    "286": "Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in rat plasma and tissue was studied after administration of quinapril, a new orally active ACE inhibitor with an intermediate duration of action. Tissue and plasma ACE was assessed by a radioinhibitor-binding assay and by in vitro autoradiography using [125I]351A as the radioligand. Individual tissues in rats were differentially inhibited in time and degree. The highest ACE inhibition in plasma and in tissues occurred within the first 2 h after gavage treatment with quinapril, 0.3 mg/kg. After 24 h, ACE was still inhibited by 25% in plasma, by 30% in the aorta, by 35% in the kidneys, and by more than 40% in cardiac atria and ventricles. Plasma and kidney tissues showed increasing ACE inhibition in a dose-dependent manner after oral dosing with quinapril. In the brain, only the structures outside the blood-brain barrier were inhibited after the administration of 0.1 mg/kg of quinapril. Similarly, testicular ACE was unaffected by quinapril. These results demonstrate a prolonged effect of quinapril on tissue ACE and suggest that ACE inhibition in the heart, vasculature, and kidneys may be of particular importance in pathologic states such as hypertension or heart failure.", 
    "287": "Hypertension need not be a natural consequence of aging; nevertheless, as many as 70% of individuals aged 70 years or more have diastolic blood pressures greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and/or systolic blood pressures greater than 160 mm Hg. Well-controlled trials have documented significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality with treatment of diastolic elevation. Double-blind, long-term, open-label studies have been conducted of quinapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in 451 older patients compared with 1,887 younger patients. Results of these studies showed that quinapril is equally effective in older and younger patients. The studies also demonstrated that the safety of quinapril in the treatment of older patients is comparable with that in younger patients, in terms of both the incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events reported. However, because many older patients have impaired renal function, which can prolong the half-life of renally excreted ACE inhibitors such as quinaprilat (the active metabolite of quinapril), they should be started on lower doses of quinapril (5 mg) than are used in younger patients. The shorter half-life and duration of action of quinaprilat compared with other once-daily ACE inhibitors may make quinapril better suited than these other agents for use in older patients.", 
    "288": "Quinapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with an intermediate duration of action, has been extensively studied in patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF) during a worldwide clinical development program. A comprehensive safety data base was established to allow appropriate analyses of the extensive patient safety data. The safety of quinapril has been evaluated in 2,697 patients with hypertension and CHF, including 451 elderly patients (greater than or equal to 65 years), and has been compared with safety data from a total of 1,058 patients receiving a comparative therapy. A comparison of the double-blind studies demonstrated that quinapril has a lower incidence of adverse events and/or withdrawals than reported for captopril or enalapril. An analysis of the onset of adverse events did not show either an increase with time on quinapril therapy or a dose relationship. The proportion of patients who experienced orthostatic hypotension or hypotension was less than that of patients who were treated with captopril or enalapril. An analysis of all events (from both double-blind and long-term, open-label studies) showed no increase in the incidence of events reported in patients with CHF compared with hypertensive patients. When the data for all studies were combined, an age analysis showed no increase in the total reporting of adverse events in elderly patients compared with the younger patients studied. The incidence of adverse events was lower in those patients not receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. An overall analysis of clinical laboratory data indicated that quinapril did not have significant adverse effects on clinical laboratory parameters when compared with captopril, enalapril, or placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "289": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study, 225 patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure (CHF) due to arterial hypertension and ischemic heart disease received quinapril, a new non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in addition to maintenance therapy with digitalis and/or diuretics. The patients were randomized into four groups: (a) placebo; (b) quinapril, 5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.); (c) quinapril, 10 mg b.i.d.; and (d) quinapril, 20 mg b.i.d. All four groups were treated for 12 weeks. Patients receiving quinapril showed significant improvement in exercise time and NYHA functional class compared with those receiving placebo. A subset of 26 patients who received neither digitalis nor diuretics showed the same beneficial response after quinapril administration that was shown by patients who received maintenance therapy. After the double-blind trial, 189 patients entered a 1-year, open-label study in which the quinapril dosage could be titrated to a maximum of 40 mg/day (20 mg b.i.d.). The beneficial effect of quinapril was maintained over 12 months even when most patients received lower doses than in the double-blind trial.", 
    "290": "To determine the safety and efficacy of single oral doses of quinapril in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), an open-label, hemodynamic trial was conducted in 11 patients with severe CHF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV] in whom previous or current therapy with diuretics and digitalis had been inadequate. After participating in this single-dose trial (acute phase), all 11 patients were entered into a 16-week, multiple-dose investigation (chronic phase). In the acute phase of the study, single oral doses of quinapril (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/day) achieved beneficial hemodynamic changes within 1 h after the onset of therapy. Maximal improvements in key hemodynamic variables (i.e., pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and total systemic vascular resistance) were observed within 4 h after dosing. The hemodynamic changes after 16 weeks of chronic quinapril therapy (5, 10, 15, and 30 mg/day) were equivalent or superior to those observed after acute therapy, indicating that quinapril produces a sustained hemodynamic benefit after chronic oral dosing. Quinapril was shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of patients with severe CHF.", 
    "291": "Quinapril, when given as initial monotherapy or in addition to diuretics, was extensively evaluated in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, defined as sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg with concomitant diuretic therapy or greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg during placebo baseline. In four double-blind, comparative trials and a subset analysis from a placebo-controlled study, 368 patients were treated with quinapril, and 338 patients were treated with comparative therapies (i.e., captopril, enalapril, or placebo). In three studies, quinapril was given in addition to diuretics, and in one study nonresponders received optional atenolol. Two studies assessed quinapril as first-line monotherapy, with nonresponders receiving hydrochlorothiazide in one study. Quinapril dosages ranged from 10 to 40 mg/day, with some patients receiving up to 80 mg/day. Quinapril effectively reduced blood pressure in patients with moderate to severe hypertension either as first-line monotherapy or when given concomitantly with a diuretic or a beta-blocker. Quinapril was comparable in efficacy to enalapril, and in several analyses quinapril was significantly more efficacious than captopril (p less than 0.05). Quinapril was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was comparable with or less than that of captopril or enalapril.", 
    "292": "The efficacy and safety of quinapril were evaluated in patients with mild to moderate hypertension [sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-115 mm Hg] in seven large, multicenter studies and in one large, single-center study. In double-blind trials, 1,367 patients were treated with quinapril and 820 patients were treated with comparative therapies (enalapril, captopril, chlorthalidone, or placebo). The usual effective dosage of quinapril was 10-40 mg/day, with some patients receiving up to 80 mg/day. Diuretics were added optionally for nonresponders in some studies. Quinapril was equally safe and effective administered either once daily (o.d.) or twice daily and was significantly more effective in lowering blood pressure than was placebo. Quinapril and enalapril administered o.d. were similarly effective in producing clinically and statistically significant reductions in resting blood pressure 24 h after dosing. Quinapril in o.d. doses was as effective as captopril administered two or three times daily. Quinapril was well tolerated; the incidence of adverse events was similar to that for placebo and was comparable to or less than that reported for captopril or enalapril. Quinapril in o.d. doses (10-40 mg/day) is safe and effective as first-line therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Diuretics can be safely added for patients who are not controlled by quinapril alone.", 
    "293": "Quinapril has been extensively studied for efficacy and safety in patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure (CHF) in the United States and Europe. Thirty-nine clinical pharmacology studies involving 383 patients have been completed. Moreover, 12 controlled, multicenter clinical studies and 3 single-center studies involving 1,793 patients have been conducted in hypertension. Three hemodynamic trials, two of which included both acute and long-term phases, and one placebo-controlled, dose-response study have been conducted in 333 patients with CHF. An additional 519 patients who completed studies on comparative agents were started on quinapril at the initiation of six long-term, open-label trials, which extended for up to 3 years. Twelve of 15 hypertension trials evaluated quinapril as first-line monotherapy in 1,452 patients with hypertension. Comparative agents included placebo in five trials (524 patients), enalapril in three trials (339 patients), captopril in four trials (335 patients), and chlorthalidone in one trial (74 patients). A total of 510 patients received quinapril in addition to a diuretic in double-blind trials: 341 patients with moderate to severe hypertension participated in three trials, and 169 patients with CHF participated in one trial. Quinapril administered once daily (o.d.) was evaluated in four placebo-controlled studies and in two studies of o.d. vs. twice-daily doses. The safety of quinapril has been evaluated in almost 2,700 patients in controlled, double-blind studies or in open-label extensions, for a total of more than 1,600 patient-years of exposure to quinapril. More than one-half of all patients participated in long-term trials: 980 patients were studied for 1 year and 315 patients were studied for 2 years at the time of data analysis. Safety data are available for 451 older patients (aged greater than or equal to 65 years), and comparative safety data from other compounds in the controlled studies are available for 1,058 patients. Quinapril's efficacy is comparable to that of other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and it has a lower incidence of adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events than has been associated with captopril or enalapril.", 
    "294": "Large clinical studies have established the therapeutic benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). In patients with hypertension, ACE inhibitors have been shown to lower blood pressure, with an excellent safety profile. They maintain or enhance the perfusion of vital organs and decrease or reverse cardiac hypertrophy without affecting myocardial contractility or conductivity. ACE inhibitors are safe to use in patients with coexisting conditions such as diabetes and asthma. They maintain or improve quality of life. As a consequence, ACE inhibitors are emerging as first-line drugs for the treatment of hypertension. In the treatment of CHF, ACE inhibitors have been shown to improve symptoms and morbidity, and to decrease mortality in high-risk patients. The possible benefits of early use of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of CHF are currently under investigation. Also of interest is the theoretical benefit that ACE-inhibitor therapy may have on CHF-related arrhythmias.", 
    "295": "An alternative angiotensin II-forming system distinct from the vascular renin-angiotensin system was demonstrated using a rat hindlimb perfusion system and synthetic substrates. This pathway was resistant to captopril and aprotinin, but was highly sensitive to chymostatin. Moreover, angiotensin II formation was substrate-dependent, i.e. angiotensin II formation from tridecapeptide human renin substrate in the presence of captopril was more than twice than that from an equimolar amount of angiotensin I. Both pathways may play a role in regulating the peripheral circulation.", 
    "296": "Seventeen adult patients with moderate and stable bronchial asthma and established essential hypertension (WHO I or II) were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of the effects of captopril (50-100 mg/day) and verapamil (160-240 mg/day) on blood pressure, orthostatic reactions, respiratory function, and asthmatic symptoms. The effect of both drugs on blood pressure was significant. Blood pressure (mean of 161/98 mm Hg initially) decreased to a mean of 147/90 and 160/91 mm Hg on captopril and verapamil, respectively, with normal orthostatic changes. There were no significant differences in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), maximal expiratory flow at 50% of FVC (MEF50), or peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements at the end of each treatment period. The subjective severity of asthma did not change significantly during the trial. No significant cough symptoms were reported on captopril.", 
    "297": "The effects of pretreatment with atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on the pressor responsiveness to injections of angiotensin II (ANGII), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and norepinephrine (NE), as well as the effect of pretreatment with ANGII on the hypotensive responses to ANF injection were studied in conscious sheep. The hemodynamic effects of ANF infusion (100 micrograms/h for 60 min) were also examined in animals pretreated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. Infusion of ANF attenuated the pressor responsiveness to exogenous AII and NE, but caused no significant change in the blood pressure increases produced by vasopressin. In contrast, infusion of AII had no effect on the immediate hypotensive response to ANF injection. Infusion of ANF for 60 min produced similar hemodynamic actions in sheep during ACE inhibition as compared with the responses observed in normal sheep, although the reduction in cardiac output and increase in calculated total peripheral resistance was attenuated. Infusion of captopril increased plasma concentration of renin (PRC), and infusion of ANF produced no further change in PRC. In conclusion, the short-term cardiovascular responses to ANF infusion in conscious sheep are not mediated solely by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. However, ANF attenuates the pressor actions of pharmacologic doses of exogenous ANGII and NE. In contrast, the vasodepressor response to exogenous ANF injection was not altered in animals receiving ANGII infusion. This study suggests that ANF may be important in regulating the effects of endogenous vasoconstrictor hormones on blood pressure (BP).", 
    "298": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril and the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors thiorphan and SCH 32615 on the changes in airway opening pressure (PaO) and the recovery of offered peptide were studied after intratracheal administration of substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) in isolated guinea pig lungs superfused through the trachea. Pao changes and the recovery of offered peptide were significantly greater in NEP inhibitor-treated lungs than in control lungs. Captopril did not cause a significant change in the physiological effects or the recovery of SP and NKA. HPLC analysis of [3H]Pro2,4-SP and 125I-Histidyl1-NKA perfused through the airways showed major cleavage products consistent with NEP action. We conclude that there is significant degradation of both SP and NKA after tracheal infusion of peptides by NEP-like but not by ACE activity; this effect significantly influences the physiological effects of these peptides.", 
    "299": "It is proposed that in essential hypertension there are two functionally abnormal populations of nephrons. One is ischemic; chronically hypersecreting renin and underexcreting sodium. The other, the larger population, is in adaptive hypernatriuresis with its renin secretion chronically suppressed. Nephrons in these two populations, each with its own detector-effector apparatus for renin secretion and sodium excretion, behave according to their individual needs, producing a physiologic discordance expressed in high blood pressure even with plasma renin levels in the so-called \"normal\" range. The unsuppressed and inappropriate renin secretion from the ischemic nephrons impairs renal function in ischemic and hyperfiltering nephrons alike, but in very different ways. To maintain glomerular filtration rate and an adequate excretion of sodium, the ischemic nephrons require a higher rate of renin secretion than they are actually receiving, because at low perfusion pressures maximal angiotensin II-induced efferent arteriolar constriction is needed to maintain glomerular filtration rate. On the other hand, the compensating hypernatriuretic nephrons become unable fully to excrete dietary sodium because they are exposed to an unwanted, inappropriately high angiotensin II level coming from the ischemic nephrons. This angiotensin II impairs sodium excretion (adaptive hypernatriuresis) from unaffected, adapting nephrons by promoting proximal sodium reabsorption and by inducing afferent constriction. The net result is that all nephrons are exposed to angiotensin II levels inappropriate for their needs. This leads to impaired ability to excrete sodium by both populations of nephrons, with sodium retention in the presence of abnormal renin secretion and perpetuation of the hypertension. The hypothesis is consistent with the hallmark pathology of multifocal afferent arteriolar narrowing seen in essential hypertension as well as with the characteristic renal hemodynamic pattern of vasoconstriction with reduced renal blood flow but with maintained glomerular filtration rate. The \"normal\" glomerular filtration rate as well as the often \"normal\" plasma renin activity may be seen as the sum of effects on the two abnormally acting populations of nephrons. Further, since any circulating renin is inappropriate in the presence of hypertension, the hypothesis helps explain why angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce blood pressure even when renin levels are not elevated.", 
    "300": "Increasing and compelling evidence continues to amass that favors the existence of local tissue renin-angiotensin systems. All renin-angiotensin system components have been demonstrated in kidney, brain, arteries, adrenals, and other organs. Favoring its clinical importance are direct demonstration of its components in tissues; dissociation between hemodynamic and structural effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibition; evidence for local modulating roles with other humoral, autocrine/paracrine, and growth factors; and the effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients who are anephric or have low plasma renin activity. Evidence will be presented demonstrating the hemodynamic/structural dissociation of pharmacologic agents that reduce cardiac mass in spontaneously hypertensive rats with left ventricular hypertrophy. Although centrally active adrenolytic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists all reduce cardiac mass, their structural and cardiac functional effects differ greatly. Even within the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group their effects vary: improving, impairing, or not changing the Frank-Starling relationships. It is postulated that there is great variability of cardiac intramyocytic penetration of the pharmacologic agents and of their local intracellular effects on mitogenesis. The implications for cardiac function and therapy are vast.", 
    "301": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been designed to reduce the generation of angiotensin II, i.e., to block the renin-angiotensin system. Interestingly, there exists a considerable dissociation between the time course of ACE inhibition and that of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Due to the greatly improved methodology used to estimate the degree of ACE inhibition in vitro and in vivo, it has become evident that the compensatory increase in renin levels in response to ACE inhibition is the key factor determining the degree and duration of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system resulting from ACE inhibition. A better understanding of these relationships would seem to be useful in determining duration of action and particularly the optimal dose of any ACE inhibitor.", 
    "302": "Angiotensin II can stimulate the sympathetic system and inhibit vagal (parasympathetic) outflow under experimental circumstances in animals. Blockade of angiotensin II formation by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors might therefore be expected to result in a reduction of sympathetic activity and enhanced parasympathetic activity. Whether this is so in normotensive or hypertensive humans and in human cardiac failure is unclear, since available techniques for recording activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are imperfect. Nevertheless, most evidence that comes from measurements of venous norepinephrine suggests that the ACE inhibitors have little or no effect on sympathetic activity in normotension and hypertension, although the activated sympathetic system in severe cardiac failure is probably suppressed. It appears that the ACE inhibitors have a parasympathomimetic action that may contribute to the hemodynamic effects of these drugs. Additional information using direct recordings of sympathetic traffic or measurements of norepinephrine \"spillover\" is needed to clarify the effects of ACE inhibitors on the sympathetic system.", 
    "303": "The goal of the present study was to describe the relative extent of vascular hypertrophy in four different types of arteries (coronary, renal, carotid, and mesenteric) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and to evaluate the effects of long-term treatment with cilazapril, a new long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on this vascular hypertrophy. For this purpose, a group of spontaneously hypertensive rats treated for four months with cilazapril (10 mg/kg orally) was compared with a group of spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with placebo. Another group of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats treated with placebo was used as a reference. At the end of the treatment period, the rats were perfused-fixed and morphometry of the carotid, renal, mesenteric and coronary arteries was performed. Vascular hypertrophy (increase of the thickness of the medial layer) was present in the four different types of arteries in a similar extent. Cilazapril normalized completely the arterial wall thickness:diameter ratio in the four different types of arteries. Further studies are required to determine whether this effect of cilazapril was due to the decrease of arterial blood pressure or to an effect of cilazapril on growth factors such as angiotensin II.", 
    "304": "The benefits derived from inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in chronic heart failure are mediated through multiple mechanisms that can be directly related to the pathophysiology of the syndrome of congestive heart failure. At the stage of myocardial failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may reverse myocardial hypertrophy and lower left ventricular filling pressure, and decrease ventricular size, thereby reducing ventricular wall remodeling. At the later stages of congestive heart failure, the cardiac effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may have added benefits in the periphery. Normalization of the vasodilatory response to exercise, increase in renal blood flow, and possibly urinary sodium excretion, as well as prevention of hypokalemia tend to improve exercise capacity, quality of life, and survival in patients with severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "305": "The effects of cilazapril 2.5 to 5.0 mg every 24 hours orally for one month on blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and plasma and urinary hormones were investigated in 11 patients with renal disease and hypertension. Six patients had renal failure (pretreatment creatinine clearance of less than 1 ml/second). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased in all patients and seven of the 11 required 5.0 mg daily. There was no significant change in the effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine clearance, although the renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced. Albuminuria was reduced in most patients but the mean change was not significant. The mean plasma potassium concentration rose significantly, but no changes in electrolyte excretion or weight were noted. Mean ambulant plasma renin activity was normal before treatment and rose significantly. Mean ambulant angiotensin II concentrations did not change. Mean ambulant plasma aldosterone concentration and mean urinary aldosterone excretion decreased significantly. Plasma arginine vasopressin and cortisol concentrations did not change. No changes were noted in plasma glucose concentrations, liver function tests, hemoglobin concentrations, or white blood cell or platelet counts. A slight looseness of bowel motions occurred in two patients and was the only side effect recorded. Cilazapril appears to be an effective and safe antihypertensive drug in patients with hypertension and renal disease.", 
    "306": "This open uncontrolled trial was undertaken to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril in patients with both hypertension and renal impairment defined as endogenous creatinine clearance below 50 ml/minute. Twenty-five patients with a diastolic blood pressure from 95 to 115 mm Hg completed the trial. Blood pressure was measured pre-dose sitting and standing every week during placebo and every second week during active therapy, as well as two hours post-dose after placebo and at the end of active therapy. The dose of cilazapril was from 0.5 to 5.0 mg daily. After eight weeks of active therapy, a reduction in both pre-dose systolic and diastolic blood pressure was seen. No orthostatic effect on blood pressure was observed. The systolic blood pressure was better controlled as measured two hours post-dose compared with pre-dose, whereas no difference was found in diastolic blood pressure. No deterioration in kidney function occurred. Some cases of moderately increased serum-potassium were observed, especially in acidotic patients. No serious adverse reactions were observed.", 
    "307": "Epidemiologic studies revealed that up to 10 percent of middle-aged men show more than 10 cessations of breathing of more than 10 seconds' duration. In these patients, increased morbidity and mortality rates have been proved. More than 50 percent of apnea patients exhibit arterial hypertension, and up to 50 percent of hypertensive patients experience sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea and essential hypertension need special attention paid to their antihypertensive therapy because the following side effects of drugs have to be avoided: increases of cardiac insufficiency, hyperviscosity of the blood, intensification of the hypersomnia by central sedation, intensification of a pre-existing tendency towards arrhythmias, and deprivation of deep and rapid eye movement sleep. In this study, the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with sleep apnea and hypertension are examined. An interim evaluation of six patients (aged 50 to 57) yielded the following results: Average Broca index, 124; average blood pressure before therapy, 159/102 mm Hg; average blood pressure after therapy, 132/78; a decrease of the apnea and hypopnea index from x = 31 (range, 12 to 77) to x = 20 (range, two to 54). Therapy did not influence sleep structure: before therapy, an average of 19 percent of sleep episodes were of the rapid eye movement type (range, 11 to 32 percent); after therapy, 23 percent were of this type on average (range, 21 to 25 percent). A final evaluation will be carried out after the second study phase for 12 patients who have been treated in a double-blind scheme with metropolol versus cilazapril.", 
    "308": "This study attempted to determine whether the autohemodilution that has repeatedly been shown to be induced by nitrates and other vasodilators is also produced by cilazapril. Fifteen healthy male volunteers were given 2.5 mg oral cilazapril daily for two weeks. Blood rheology was quantified by measuring blood and plasma viscosity, hematocrit count, red blood cell aggregation and deformability, and white blood cell clogging at baseline, four hours after first dose and four and 24 hours after the last dose. No acute or chronic changes were observed except for a significant increase in red blood cell deformability and a decrease in white blood cell clogging. It is concluded that hemodilution secondary to vasodilation may occur but be offset by hemoconcentration induced by aldosterone inhibition and decrease of anti-diuretic hormone levels. The changes in deformability and clogging may benefit microcirculatory function, a hypothesis that would need further investigation in controlled trials.", 
    "309": "We studied the effect of a single dose of cilazapril, 5.0 mg orally, on systolic and diastolic cardiac function in eight hypertensive patients using a double-blind crossover placebo-controlled design. All patients had concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (measured by echocardiography), unimpaired systolic function (measured by radionuclide ventriculography), and long-standing hypertension treated by a combination of beta-blockers and diuretics. Radionuclide scintigraphy was performed with cilazapril and placebo, given one week apart. A two-week washout period of all cardioactive drugs preceded the study. Within three hours after oral administration of cilazapril, the time to peak filling rate of the left ventricle, expressed as a percentage of diastole, was reduced from 44.5 +/- 13.2 percent to 31.2 +/- 7.2 percent (p less than 0.05). Systolic blood pressure was also significantly reduced by cilazapril. Heart rate was slightly reduced. Left ventricular ejection fraction, peak filling rate, and the absolute time to peak filling rate were not significantly altered. Cilazapril improves a sensitive index of diastolic cardiac function in hypertensive patients.", 
    "310": "The effect of cilazapril as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide was assessed in 30 severely hypertensive patients, 23 men and seven women, aged 38 to 68 years, with sitting diastolic blood pressure of more than 115 mmHg. Fifteen patients had left ventricular hypertrophy documented by two-dimensional echo-cardiography. Sitting systolic blood pressure was reduced from 175.8 +/- 2.0 to 143.3 +/- 3.0 mmHg within 25 days of therapy (p less than 0.0001); sitting diastolic blood pressure decreased in the same period from 117.0 +/- 1.0 to 87.8 +/- 2.0 mmHg (p less than 0.0001), whereas heart rate remained unchanged. In 19 patients treated for an average of 48 weeks the therapeutic response was maintained during the long-term period. The mean effective dose was cilazapril 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg in 90 percent of the patients. Left ventricular mass decreased from 357 +/- 17 to 314 +/- 22 g (nine patients; p less than 0.005) and a correlation (Spearman r = 0.57, p less than 0.01) was found between left ventricular mass and sitting systolic blood pressure before and during treatment. Deceleration half time of peak early diastolic inflow velocity decreased significantly from 128 +/- 9 to 108 +/- 7 msec (p less than 0.05). Glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow remained within normal limits, whereas renal vascular resistance decreased from 0.16 +/- 0.0 to 0.10 +/- 0.0 resistance units (10 patients; p less than 0.01). Cilazapril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide was effective in the treatment of severe hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy regression influenced favorably left ventricular diastolic function in some patients, whereas renal hemodynamics were generally not affected by the therapy.", 
    "311": "Cilazapril is a structurally new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that lacks a sulfhydryl moiety. Its duration of action is consistent with a once-daily regimen. Cilazapril was studied in multiple-dose trials that included more than 4,500 hypertensive patients worldwide. Approximately 450 patients received cilazapril as monotherapy for more than one year, and another 430 patients were treated with cilazapril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide for more than six months. Cilazapril at doses of 2.5 to 5 mg once daily is clinically and statistically significantly more effective than placebo and as effective after eight weeks of therapy as hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, propranolol sustained release, captopril, and enalapril at the doses recommended by the manufacturers. The overall incidence of adverse events observed during cilazapril therapy is comparable with that seen with placebo in double-blind studies. Cilazapril 2.5 to 5 mg once daily seems to be better tolerated than hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol. Only five adverse events were reported at an incidence of 1 percent or more in controlled trials; these were headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and chest pain, which all occurred at a frequency similar to that with placebo. Overall, cilazapril is effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of patients with hypertension.", 
    "312": "In clinical pharmacology studies cilazapril, after its bioactivation to cilazaprilat, was characterized as a potent, reversible angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a terminal half-life of 30 to 50 hours consistent with saturable binding to ACE. Despite the arterial vasodilation, only slight increases in heart rate were found. Cilazapril had no acute effect on cardiovascular reflexes. Cilazapril increased effective renal plasma flow slightly. Glomerular filtration rate remained unaltered. A close and steep correlation between cilazaprilat plasma concentration and ACE inhibition was found. The potency of cilazaprilat, defined as the concentration of cilazaprilat causing 50 percent ACE inhibition, was approximately 1 ng/ml plasma. In short-term studies in hypertensive patients, it appeared that more than 90 percent of plasma ACE inhibition is needed to obtain blood pressure reduction. The result of various dose-response studies established the indirect relationship between dose, plasma concentration of the drug, and the blood pressure response and identified the dose producing maximal effect (i.e., 5 mg). Cilazapril had relatively long-lasting effects on ACE inhibition. In patients with severe chronic renal impairment or hepatic failure, the duration of ACE inhibition of cilazapril was prolonged. In these patients a reduction of the dose and/or less frequent dosing is recommended. There was no clinically relevant interaction of cilazapril with food or furosemide. The effects of hydrochlorothiazide on sodium and chloride excretion were potentiated by cilazapril. An additive effect of propranolol and nitrendipine on the blood pressure response to cilazapril was observed. An interaction with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cilazapril might occur, potentially reducing the blood pressure lowering effect. In general cilazapril was well tolerated.", 
    "313": "The effect of cilazapril, a new inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, in a dosage of 2.5 or 5 mg once daily, was compared with that of hydrochlorothiazide 25 or 50 mg in 169 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Blood pressure at entry was 158/103 mm Hg (cilazapril) and 160/103 mm Hg (hydrochlorothiazide). Cilazapril 2.5 mg caused a decrease in blood pressure of 14.7 +/- 2.3/12.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg compared with a decrease of 12.6 +/- 2.2/10.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Those patients who required an increase of dosage to the higher level then showed decreases of 15.0 +/- 2.1/14.3 +/- 1.2 (cilazapril) and 19.7 +/- 1.9/13.3 +/- 1.2 hydrochlorothiazide. All decreases in blood pressure were statistically significant but were not statistically different from each other. Fifty-one percent of patients reached a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less receiving 2.5 mg of cilazapril and an additional 28 percent of patients reached this goal receiving 5 mg. The figures for patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide were comparable: 36 and 35 percent. Twenty-one adverse events remotely, possibly, or probably related to therapy were reported with cilazapril and 32 with hydrochlorothiazide. Three patients withdrew from cilazapril because of mild angioedema, headaches, and chest pain, respectively, and three patients withdrew from hydrochlorothiazide treatment because of fatigue, dizziness, and gastric hemorrhage. Hydrochlorothiazide caused a decrease in potassium levels and an increase in levels of cholesterol, uric acid, urea and - gamma cilazapril had no adverse biochemical effects. Cilazapril lowered blood pressure to the same extent as hydrochlorothiazide. Young patients had better responses to cilazapril than to hydrochlorothiazide. It is concluded that cilazapril is an effective and safe drug for patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "314": "The efficacy and safety of cilazapril monotherapy was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, ascending-dose titration study in 83 elderly essential hypertensive patients. After a four-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients received 1 mg of cilazapril once daily for the first four weeks. This dose was then increased to 2.5 mg once daily for the next four weeks for patients whose pre-dose sitting diastolic blood pressure was above 90 mm Hg. Similarly, at Week 8 the dose was increased in such patients from 1 to 2.5 mg or from 2.5 to 5 mg once daily. A 12-hour blood pressure profile was performed on the first day of active treatment and of each dose increase. Mean decrease of sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline (102.7 +/- 0.4 mm Hg) at Week 12 was 13.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Seventy-five percent of patients had a decrease of 10 mm Hg or more from baseline sitting diastolic blood pressure, and in 60 percent sitting diastolic blood pressure normalized. Unexpectedly large decreases of blood pressure after the first dose were seen only in three patients and none had clinical symptoms. Fourteen patients (16.9 percent) reported adverse events, but most of these were judged unlikely to be related to therapy. Four patients with predisposing underlying diseases experienced potentially serious adverse events (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and blood pressure elevation) whose relationship to therapy was judged remote or only possible. There was no particular pattern of changes in laboratory values. The results indicate that cilazapril is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug for the elderly.", 
    "315": "The Working Group on Hypertension in Diabetes recommends starting pharmacologic treatment of hypertension with a small dose of a thiazide, beta-blocker, prazosin hydrochloride, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or calcium channel blocker. Thus, these alternatives are regarded as first-line treatment in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. Both thiazides and beta-blockers can cause deterioration in glycemic control and have an unfavorable influence on the lipoprotein profile. These metabolic side effects may partly counteract beneficial effects. Non-selective beta-blockers should probably be avoided in diabetic patients, since blockade of the beta-2 receptor may be associated with a compromise in peripheral blood flow and with problems associated with hypoglycemia. Cardioselective beta-blockers, which may have primary preventive effects on coronary disease, are beneficial in this patient group. In patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus without nephropathy or overt fluid retention, diuretic therapy could be replaced by sodium restriction and/or calcium channel blocker therapy, since these agents also have a mild diuretic effect. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and prazosin hydrochloride have minimal metabolic side effects, making them suitable for treatment of hypertension in this patient group.", 
    "316": "The effects of antihypertensive drugs on glucose metabolism are an important consideration in the selection of pharmacologic therapy for diabetic patients. Diuretics can elevate blood glucose levels, aggravate glucose intolerance, and predispose diabetic patients to hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma. Beta-blocking drugs often exacerbate and prolong insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetics. Beta-blockers may also cause hyperglycemia. Central agonists, alpha-blockers, and vasodilators apparently have neutral effects on carbohydrate metabolism in normal subjects or in hypertensive diabetics. Calcium channel blockers may disturb carbohydrate metabolism in diabetic patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have little effect on glucose metabolism. Because diabetic patients are prone to fluid, electrolyte, hormone, and lipid disturbances, it is important to consider the effects of antihypertensive drugs on these aspects of metabolism when selecting pharmacologic therapy. The effects of various antihypertensive drugs on sodium, calcium, magnesium, and acid/base balance are reviewed. The effects of these drugs on serum uric acid and potassium, as well as on hormone and lipid levels, are also considered.", 
    "317": "Experimental and clinical evidence points to the existence of a cardiomyopathy associated with diabetes mellitus that is not due to coronary atherosclerosis. The condition is characterized by distinct clinical presentations and physiologic and biochemical abnormalities. Potential mechanisms for the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy are complex but are probably associated, in part, with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Primary hypertension is also associated with the development of myocardial abnormalities. Many of these changes are similar to those seen in diabetic cardiomyopathy. It is now clear that the co-existence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus produces a more severe cardiomyopathy than that produced by hypertension or diabetes alone. Potential mechanisms for interaction are numerous. Treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients must be targeted to more specific needs. Antihypertensive drugs should not worsen cardiac risk factors or glucose control and should have favorable effects on left ventricular function. The calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have pharmacologic profiles that make them attractive as monotherapy for diabetic patients.", 
    "318": "Heart failure is almost without exception associated with arrhythmias, which may be either supraventricular or ventricular. Supraventricular arrhythmias include frequent supraventricular extrasystoles, and episodic or chronic atrial fibrillation. The absence of atrial contraction may further reduce cardiac output, as may impaired control of QRS frequency. Therefore, supraventricular arrhythmias may be markers of the degree of heart failure and these arrhythmias will respond to heart failure therapy including diuretics, nitrates and, possibly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Ventricular rate will be controlled by cardiac glycosides and further rate reduction obtained by verapamil or diltiazem. The rationale for this therapy is to optimize heart rate without compromising contractility. Severe heart failure is generally accompanied by severe ventricular arrhythmias including repetitive forms. Improving left ventricular function by ACE inhibition is accompanied by a reduction in the number of ventricular premature complexes and also a reduction in the rate of ventricular tachycardia. ACE inhibition reduces mortality but does not seem to influence sudden death rate, and sudden death patients may have different neurohormonal responses compared with patients destined to die of progressive heart failure. Uncontrolled trials with class IA or class III antiarrhythmic drugs have suggested that prognosis may be improved, but other studies have pointed out the increased risk of proarrhythmic responses in patients with low ejection fraction.", 
    "319": "Effects of a single administration of captopril on plasma and urinary vasopressin (AVP) were examined in 8 normotensive (NT) female volunteers, 17 patients with essential hypertension (EHT) and 2 patients with primary aldosteronism (PA). Orally-administered captopril (25 mg) had no effect on plasma AVP levels in the three groups. However, urinary excretion of AVP decreased significantly after use of captopril in both NT and EHT subjects (-57% and -67%, respectively), and also in PA subjects. The magnitude of reduction in urinary AVP was significantly correlated with the pretreatment levels of plasma renin activity (r = 0.85) and plasma aldosterone concentration (r = 0.88) in NT subjects. Such correlation was not found in EHT subjects. These results suggest that captopril decreases AVP secretion in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects, but the relation of the magnitude in AVP reduction by captopril to the peripheral renin-angiotensin system might be different.", 
    "320": "The protection of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril and ramiprilat, against free radical-mediated myocardial injury were studied in isolated working rat hearts. Free radicals were generated by electrolysis of Krebs-Henseleit solution with 10 mA direct current for 1 min. Both captopril (360 mumol/l) and ramiprilat (12.5 mumol/l) significantly reduced the decrease of left ventricle dP/dt'max, coronary flow (CF), myocardial superoxide dismutase (SOD) and creatine kinase (CK) activities and the elevation of S-T segment of epicardial ECG as well as the rise of myocardial malondialdehyde (MDA) content caused by electrolysed perfusate. Captopril afforded a dose-dependent protection on cardiac functions with various concentrations of 45, 90, 180 and 360 mumol/l. Iloprost (30 nmol/l), a stable mimetic of prostacyclin, could also alleviate free radical-mediated myocardial injuries. All the beneficial effects of ramiprilat (12.5 mumol/l) were abolished by the administration of indomethacin (5 mumol). In contrast, captopril (90 mumol/l) still exhibited significant protective effects after indomethacin (9 mumol) was administered, though these protective effects were insignificantly weakened. In order to assess the role of sulfhydryl (-SH) group in the effects of captopril, a SH-containing drug S8 and a disulfide DG4, both are deficient in ACE inhibitory properties in vitro, were examined. Data showed that S8 (180 mumol/l) provided a significant protection while DG4 showed no protective effect. It is concluded that ACE inhibitors can protect against free radical-induced myocardial damage. Ramiprilat, a non-SH-containing ACE inhibitor, inhibits free radical-induced damages mainly by stimulation of prostacyclin synthesis and/or release. In addition to this effect, captopril, a SH-containing ACE inhibitor, may exert additional anti-free radical effects by a mechanism which is probably related to the sulfhydryl group.", 
    "321": "We compared the effects produced by acute and chronic administration of captopril in sinoaortic denervated rats. In conscious undisturbed rats acute administration of captopril (10 mg/kg intravenously) produced acute transient reductions in mean arterial pressure of 16 and 26%, 6 h (mean arterial pressure 148 +/- 4 mmHg) and 24 h (133 +/- 3 mmHg) after the sinoaortic denervation, respectively. Chronic captopril treatment (30 mg/day orally) produced a permanent attenuation of the hypertension induced by sino-aortic denervation, as shown by a beat-to-beat analysis of arterial pressure for 80 min. The attenuation was 11% (131 +/- 7 versus 148 +/- 4 mmHg) and 24% (103 +/- 9 versus 133 +/- 3 mmHg) in rats studied 6 and 24 h after the sinoaortic denervation, respectively. Chronic captopril administration produced no alteration in the tachycardia, nor in the heart rate variability of the sinoaortic denervated rats; the latter was lower than that of normotensive rats. These data show that while acute administration of captopril in sinoaortic denervated rats produced a rapid hypotensive response, chronic administration produced a long-lasting attenuation of hypertension, presumably by interference with sympathetic cardiovascular control.", 
    "322": "The haemodynamic and neurohormonal responses to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril were studied in 12 patients with primary autonomic failure; seven had multiple system atrophy and five had pure autonomic failure. Basal supine mean arterial blood pressure was higher in the patients with multiple system atrophy than in those with pure autonomic failure and the normal subjects. Basal plasma noradrenaline levels were normal in the patients with multiple system atrophy, but lower in those with pure autonomic failure. Captopril lowered the mean arterial pressure in the patients with multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure but not in the normal subjects. In the patients with multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure, captopril lowered the cardiac output and the stroke volume. Forearm vascular resistance was unchanged. No significant changes occurred in the normal subjects. Plasma renin activity was unchanged after captopril in the patients with autonomic failure, but rose in the normal subjects. Plasma noradrenaline was unchanged in all groups after the administration of captopril. We conclude that captopril lowers the mean arterial pressure in patients with multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure. After the administration of captopril there is a reduction in cardiac output, secondary to a fall in stroke volume. The vasodepressor response to captopril in patients with autonomic failure is not related to the basal level of plasma renin activity or sympathetic nervous activity, indicating that the hypotensive effects of bradykinin or prostaglandins, or both, may contribute.", 
    "323": "Physical exercise can induce micro-albuminuria, a urinary albumin excretion rate of 20-200 micrograms/min, in diabetics without micro-albuminuria at rest (stage II of diabetic nephropathy). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the acute effects of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, on exercise-induced micro-albuminuria in hypertensive diabetics with stage II nephropathy. Eleven hypertensive World Health Organisation (WHO) stages I-II non-obese diabetics (five insulin-dependent diabetics, six non-insulin dependent diabetics) underwent five submaximal cycloergometric tests, the first two in basal conditions, the other three after 24-h administration of captopril (25 mg twice a day), placebo (1 tablet twice a day) or nifedipine AR (20 mg twice a day) according to a randomized double-blind design. Our results demonstrate that despite a lower reduction in exercise blood pressure, captopril is more effective than nifedipine in blunting diabetic exercise-induced micro-albuminuria.", 
    "324": "In isolated ischaemic rat hearts, endothelin induced a short transient increase, followed by a lasting decrease in coronary flow and an increase in the left ventricular dp/dt max in a concentration-dependent manner. Both enzyme activities and lactate output were increased in the venous effluent. Myocardial tissue levels of glycogen, ATP and creatine phosphate were reduced. Endothelin aggravated post-ischaemic reperfusion arrhythmias. Perfusion with ramiprilat and bradykinin increased coronary flow and left ventricular dp/dt max and reduced reperfusion arrhythmias; enzyme activities and lactate output were significantly reduced and in the myocardial tissue glycogen and energy-rich phosphates were preserved. In comparison, indomethacin prolonged reperfusion arrhythmias, decreased coronary flow and increased the enzyme activities with no changes in myocardial metabolism. When ramiprilat and bradykinin were combined with endothelin, reperfusion arrhythmias and the enzyme activities were reduced but the decrease in coronary flow could not be fully blocked. Indomethacin aggravated the endothelin-induced coronary flow reduction, enzyme release and reperfusion arrhythmias but had no effects on the other parameters.", 
    "325": "The antihypertensive efficacy and subjective and physical tolerability of three different pharmacological treatments (metoprolol, captopril and the combination of hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride) were compared with placebo in 36 elderly hypertensives (aged 61-79 years), according to a Latin-square double-blind design. The placebo and the active treatments were administered for 2 months. Seated blood pressure was significantly reduced by all the pharmacological treatments compared with placebo, but only metoprolol significantly reduced the heart rate. No haematological or biochemical changes were observed during the study. Physical fitness, evaluated as endurance in a standard cycle ergometer exercise test, was slightly decreased after the treatment with metoprolol and the diuretic combination and slightly improved after treatment with captopril. Subjective tolerability, evaluated by a check-list of symptoms, was better during the active therapies, and in particular during the captopril treatment, than during the placebo treatment. Our results indicate that all three active treatment regimens significantly reduce blood pressure in elderly hypertensives and that captopril appears slightly better tolerated physically and subjectively.", 
    "326": "Production and metabolism of angiotensin I (Ang I) were studied during a constant intravenous infusion of mono-iodinated 125I-Ang I in seven patients with essential hypertension taking 50 mg captopril twice a day. The elimination of arterially delivered 125I-Ang I reached 80% in the kidneys, 45% in the forearm, 58% in the leg and 95% in the hepatomesenteric vascular bed. Despite the high level of elimination of Ang I, plasma levels of Ang I in the leg, forearm and renal vein were not different from that of arterial plasma. In the hepatic vein the plasma level of Ang I was 50% lower than in the aorta. Thus, 50-90% of endogenous Ang I in the veins is derived from new regional production. The blood transit time through the kidneys, limbs and hepatomesenteric region is too short for plasma renin activity to account for the measured new Ang I production. Our results indicate that a high percentage of plasma Ang I may be produced locally in the tissues, and not in circulating plasma.", 
    "327": "All the components of the renin-angiotensin system are present within the kidney and intrarenal effects have been demonstrated. We have previously shown that intrarenally confined doses of angiotensin II (Ang II) decreased renal excretory and haemodynamic function. In the present study we investigated an increase in renal excretory and haemodynamic function in response to intrarenally confined doses of the renin inhibitor ACRIP to inhibit renin, teprotide to inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and saralasin to block Ang II receptors. We studied the effects of combined intrarenal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in five female uninephrectomized conscious dogs on a sodium metabolic balance of 5 mmol/day. We infused ACRIP, teprotide and saralasin combined over 30 min in doses confined to the kidney, and again with an intrarenally confined dose of Ang II. There were no changes in renal function during the control study. During the combined infusion (ACRIP + teprotide + saralasin), the urine flow rate increased from 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 0.9 +/- 0.1 ml/min (P less than 0.001), urinary sodium excretion increased from 6.4 +/- 0.4 to 30.2 +/- 2.5 mumol/min (P less than 0.0001), the glomerular filtration rate increased from 29.3 +/- 0.7 to 42.0 +/- 1.2 ml/min (P less than 0.0001), renal plasma flow increased from 60.3 +/- 0.8 to 139.6 +/- 1.8 ml/min (P less than 0.001) and the fractional sodium excretion increased from 0.1 +/- 0.01 to 0.5 +/- 0.04% (P less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "328": "In order to determine the dose regimen of new antihypertensive compounds, between-patient trials are usually performed. However, the combined use of a crossover design and a precise methodology to measure blood pressure (BP) and biological effects can provide relevant data with a minimal number of patients, if there is no carryover effect which invalidates the experiment. Such goals were successfully achieved with just 25 hypertensive patients who were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion every 2 weeks to a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazepril [10 mg once a day (o.d.), 20 mg o.d., 10 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) and 20 mg b.i.d.], or a placebo. The mean BP fall [systolic (SBP)/diastolic (DBP), measured in mmHg] just before drug intake was significantly greater with benazepril: -14/-9 (10 mg o.d.); -15/-8.5 (20 mg o.d.); -22.5/-14 (10 mg b.i.d.), and -21/-13 (20 mg b.i.d.) in comparison with placebo (-3/-3). Mean active plasma renin (measured in pg/ml), assessed by an immunoradiometric assay based on two monoclonal antibodies, increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner, by +0.7 (placebo), +15.0 (10 mg o.d.), +23.4 (20 mg o.d.), +44.4 (10 mg b.i.d.) and +78.8 (20 mg b.i.d.), whereas plasma ACE decreased (by 67 and 78% after 10 and 20 mg o.d., respectively, and by 91-92% after 10 and 20 mg b.i.d.). In the clinical development of an antihypertensive drug, the earlier use of such within-patient studies, with the random insertion of one placebo period between the active periods, should help in the dose-response curve search.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Recent evidence suggests that not all antihypertensive agents have similar efficacy in hypertensive patients, nor do all convey the same benefit in terms of reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. This review considers the efficacy of various antihypertensive agents in blacks, with particular reference to the impact of these agents on cardiovascular disease risk factors and on associated diseases often encountered in black hypertensives. Emphasis is placed on the use of therapeutic approaches other than diuretics alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents from the vantage point of efficacy and enhancement of cardiovascular and metabolic benefits.",

No change occurred in blood pressure or glomerular filtration rate (GFR): 95.2 +/- 7.2, control versus 95.0 +/- 9.0, CGS 13080 (ml/min); or renal plasma flow (RPF): 363.2 +/- 34.2, control, versus 373.2 +/- 31.2, CGS 13080, (ml/min).

Serum levels of renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone were not altered by CGS 13080. Captopril when dosed to lower diastolic blood pressure 5-7 mm Hg did not significantly affect GFR, RPF or RVR. Nor did it affect platelet generation of thromboxane B2 or urine concentrations of PGE, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or thromboxane B2.

    "332": "Captopril therapy is effective in the management of congestive heart failure. The development of hypotension, using low or standard doses, frequently precludes many patients from continuing therapy. The use of 1 mg \"microdose\" captopril capsules has been used for dose titration to avoid complications associated with hypotension. This study evaluated the chemical stability of 1 mg microdose captopril capsules, extemporaneously prepared from commercially available captopril tablets for a period of 60 days which were stored in an amber vial at standard room temperature conditions. Captopril samples were analyzed in triplicate using high pressure liquid chromatographic method on days 0, 30, and 60 following perparation. There was no degradation observed on any of the sampling days. Therefore, the formulation of 1 mg captopril capsules remain stable for a period of 60 days.", 
    "333": "1. Rat isolated atria were incubated with 3H-noradrenaline and the intramural sympathetic nerves were stimulated at 2 Hz for 60 s. The stimulation-induced (SI) efflux of radioactivity was used as an index of release of transmitter noradrenaline. 2. Isoprenaline (0.1 mumol/L) alone did not increase noradrenaline release. Cocaine (30 mumol/L) produced a 73% increase in the stimulation-induced release of noradrenaline. In the presence of cocaine, isoprenaline enhanced noradrenaline release by 22%. 3. In the presence of cocaine, both angiotensin I (0.3 mumol/L) and angiotensin II (0.3 mumol/L) produced almost two-fold enhancements in the SI release of noradrenaline. 4. Captopril (5 mumol/L) blocked the facilitatory effect of angiotensin I on noradrenaline release but did not alter that of isoprenaline. 5. Saralasin (0.1 mumol/L) reduced the facilitatory effect of angiotensin II on noradrenaline release but did not alter that of isoprenaline. 6. The findings indicate that the facilitation of noradrenaline release by isoprenaline in rat atria is not mediated by local formation of angiotensin II.",

There was no significant improvement in cough or sense of well-being. Blood pressure, renal function, plasma renin and ACE activity were unchanged. Sulindac however, appears to be effective in some individuals in reducing ACE inhibitor-induced cough with acceptable tolerance and few side effects. Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanism of sulindac's interaction with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "335": "The vasopressin-mediated recovery of arterial pressure observed in adult rats following pharmacological blockade of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems is reduced by neonatal capsaicin treatment. We now demonstrate a similar but reversible effect following treatment of adult Wistar or Sprague-Dawley rats with N-vanillylnonanamide (50 mg/kg sc). One day after treatment, Wistar, but typically not Sprague-Dawley, rats had lost weight and exhibited increased sensitivity to the anesthetic effects of methohexital sodium. In both strains, captopril treatment caused hypotension. After captopril and ganglionic blockade, vasopressin-mediated recovery of arterial pressure was significantly inhibited. Furthermore, treated Wistar rats had reduced sensitivity to the ocular irritancy of N-vanillylnonanamide when examined 2 days postdose. All deficits reversed within 2 wk of dosing. These data suggest that capsaicin-sensitive systems participate in homeostatic mechanisms engaged during acute hypotension. Because the dose of N-vanillylnonanamide employed in the present study has previously been shown to destroy unmyelinated afferent fibers when administered to adult rats, recovery of the functional deficits may reflect regeneration of damaged processes or assumption of their function by undamaged neurons innervating adjacent sites. By extrapolation from other studies of capsaicin, damage to some central neurons may also be involved.", 
    "336": "The effective treatment of hypertension is a major factor in the declining incidence of stroke in North America. There are subsets of patients, however, in which antihypertensive therapy may actually cause cerebral ischemia and infarction. Elderly patients and those with malignant hypertension, acute stroke, and occlusive cerebrovascular disease appear to be the populations at greatest risk of iatrogenic stroke. This article reviews the effect of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, direct vasodilators, and calcium-channel blockers on cerebral blood flow in various populations. Although many investigations have been performed, it remains difficult to predict the risk of cerebral hypoperfusion due to antihypertensive medication in an individual patient. It is best for practitioners to be aware of the patient populations at risk and treat high blood pressure cautiously in these patients.", 
    "337": "We determined if captopril could reduce urinary cystine excretion in homozygous cystinuric patients. Seven patients were treated with 150 mg. captopril daily after determination of baseline 24-hour urine cystine excretion. All patients had a history of multiple cystine stones, and were on chronic fluid and alkalization therapy. Five patients had previously been on D-penicillamine. Cystine excretion studies were repeated 1 to 5 months after institution of captopril. Baseline 24-hour urinary cystine excretion ranged from 580 to 970 mg. per gm. creatinine (mean 744). After institution of captopril these levels decreased to a range of 113 to 581 mg. per gm. creatinine (mean 371). These values on treatment represented a statistically significant decrease to between 18 and 89% of baseline levels (p equals 0.0045). We conclude that captopril can significantly, and at times profoundly, decrease urinary cystine excretion in patients with homozygous cystinuria. Further studies are required to elucidate fully the mechanism of urinary cystine reduction and to help define a possible role for this drug in routine maintenance or dissolution therapy.", 
    "338": "A 41-yr-old woman with bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS) and renovascular hypertension is presented. In this patient, the routine [99mTc]diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scintigraphy without Captopril was normal and the subsequent study with Captopril showed a marked decrease in glomerular filtration rate of the right kidney alone. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the functionally affected right kidney immediately evoked new renin-dependent hypertension caused by the untreated left RAS. This patient illustrates two major points: (a) as a diagnostic tool, the sensitivity of Captopril renal scintigraphy may be compromised by an inability to detect bilateral RAS, but (b) after angioplasty, it can be useful for evaluating the treated kidney and in revealing contralateral disease that may benefit from angioplasty.", 
    "339": "Hypertension is a major public health problem amendable to treatment. Numerous large scale clinical trials have demonstrated that effective, sustained control of elevated arterial pressure to a level below 140/90 mm Hg results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Over the past 4 decades antihypertensive drug therapy has evolved from a stepwise, but physiologically rational, selection of agents to specific programs tailored to individualized therapy for specific clinical situations. This evolution has taken place because of a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertensive diseases, the development of new classes of antihypertensive agents that attack specific pressor mechanisms, and the ability to wed these concepts into a rational and specific therapeutic program. Thus, with the currently available spectrum of antihypertensive therapy, we are now able to select treatment for special patient populations utilizing a single agent and, therefore, we can protect the heart, brain and kidneys and maintain organ function without exacerbating associated diseases. These benefits are clear-cut and have resulted in many millions of patients becoming the beneficiaries of this transfer of careful, painstaking and purposeful investigative experiences into clinical practice.", 
    "340": "The consequences of a chronic destruction of sympathetic nerves or of the blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) on the blood pressure (BP) level and its spontaneous variability were studied using a computerized method which allows a continuous monitoring of BP in conscious unrestrained rats. Guanethidine, used to lesion the sympathetic fibres did not alter the BP level but significantly enhanced its variability. On the opposite, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition decreased the BP level without changing its variability. It is concluded that both systems play a complementary role as the RAS determines the long-term BP level while the sympathetic nerves control its short-term variability in conscious animals.", 
    "341": "In order to evaluate the specificity of the renal contraluminal PAH transport system for amino acids, oligopeptides and their conjugates, the inhibitory potency of these substances against contraluminal [3H] PAH influx has been determined. For this, inhibition of 3H-PAH flux from the interstitium into cortical tubular cells of the rat kidney in situ has been measured. Apparent Ki values were evaluated by a computer program assuming competitive inhibition. Unconjugated amino acids (glycine, cysteine, alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, aspartate, glutamate, arginine, ornithine and lysine) do not inhibit [3H] PAH influx. The very hydrophobic tryptophan, however, does. N-alpha-methylation does not change this behaviour. N-alpha-acetylation does not evoke interaction with the PAH transporter when it occurs with glycine, cysteine (to yield mercapturic acid), arginine, ornithine and lysine. However, it renders alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, L-aspartate moderately, and L-glutamate strongly, inhibitory. The acetylated D-isomers of alanine, leucine and phenylalanine exert a higher inhibitory potency compared with the respective L-isomers. N-alpha-benzoylation of L-lysine is ineffective. N-alpha-benzoylation, however, evokes interaction with the PAH transporter, when it occurs with ornithine less than arginine less than histidine less than glycine = leucine less than alanine = phenylalanine = aspartate = glutamate. Dipeptides interact with the PAH transporter according to their hydrophobicity (Nozaki scale down to 0.9, Fauch\u00e8re scale up to 1.0). N-acetylation does not change this behaviour. Hydrophobicity also renders oligopeptides, as angiotensin II, inhibitory against PAH transport. Similarly the anionic angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors Captopril, Enalapril and Ramipril inhibit contraluminal PAH influx.", 
    "342": "To elucidate functional changes in the vascular smooth muscle of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after chronic inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, we examined the contractile responses to different pharmacological interventions in the isolated aortas from SHR treated with a novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, CS-622 (10 mg/kg/day) for 20 weeks. In normal K+ medium, a marked contraction was elicited by increasing Ca2+ concentration from 0 to 3 mM in aortas from a control group of SHR, but not in aortas from SHR treated with CS-622. In 60 mM K+ medium, however, the sensitivity of aorta to Ca2+ was almost the same in the two groups. A calcium channel activator, CGP-28392 (10(-7) to 10(-6) M), induced a marked contraction in the aortas from control SHR, but not in the aortas from CS-622-treated SHR. When slightly depolarized in 10 or 12 mM K+ solution, the aortas from CS-622-treated SHR contracted in response to CGP-28392. The aortic sensitivity to KCl contraction was much lower in CS-622-treated SHR than in untreated SHR, whereas the sensitivity to phenylephrine contraction was little different in the two groups. These contractile profiles of aortas from CS-622-treated SHR were very similar to those from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats but not to those from hydralazine-treated SHR. These data suggest that contractions due to Ca2+ through voltage-dependent calcium channels are exaggerated in SHR aorta and that long-term treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suppresses the abnormal contractility of SHR vascular smooth muscle, probably through alterations of voltage-related functions of calcium channels.", 
    "343": "Extrapolation from one country to another concerning costs of treatment of essential hypertension has to be made with caution because of wide variation of socio-economic differences and governmental price setting attitudes. The worldwide antihypertensive drug market shows a strong increase in the last few years and reflects the evolution away from diuretics and toward the more expensive ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, with a decreasing percent market of beta-blockers and absolute stagnation in other antihypertensives outside these four groups of drugs.", 
    "344": "The hemodynamic parameters (right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, heart rate, blood pressure) and neurohumoral responses (alpha-ANP, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, angiotensin II) of Captopril, oral ACE inhibitor, and Bunazosin, oral alpha 1-blocker, were investigated in 28 patients with congestive heart failure at rest and after exercise. These data were analysed in both acute and chronic phases. 1) Acute effect. Captopril produced significant improvement of neurohumoral factors at rest and also after exercise. Bunazosin reduced alpha-ANP, but other neurohumoral factors did not change. Bunazosin produced significant hemodynamic improvement both at rest and after exercise. 2) Chronic effect. Captopril produced significant hemodynamic improvement both at rest and after exercise. Improvement of neurohumoral factors in acute phase was also preserved at chronic phase. On Bunazosin, improvement of hemodynamics at acute phase was also preserved at chronic phase without deterioration of neurohumoral factors.", 
    "345": "There are several reports of beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in both primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension. However the effect of ACE inhibitors in mitral stenosis is not documented. The authors report three patients with severe mitral stenosis in whom surgery was delayed. They had initial symptomatic improvement with diuretics and sodium restriction, but had recurrence of their symptoms while on treatment. Enalapril not only relieved their symptoms in particular exertional dyspnoea and haemoptysis but prevented recurrence and improved their effort tolerance without causing excessive fall of blood pressure or impairment of renal function.", 
    "346": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance. That the peripheral vasodilating properties of ACE inhibitors might not be homogeneously distributed in all vascular beds and might differ from one drug to another has been investigated in the normotensive rat by the pulsed Doppler technique using the active components of four different ACE inhibitors: captopril, enalapril, perindopril, and ramipril. Systemic (cardiac output and blood pressure) and regional (kidney, mesentery, hindquarter) hemodynamic responses to saline or to cumulative bolus injections (0.01-1 mg/kg) of captopril, enalaprilat, perindoprilat, or ramiprilat were continuously monitored. The effects of successive bolus injections (0.3-300 ng/kg) of angiotensinII were also investigated. The four ACE inhibitors produced an almost complete blockade of plasma angiotensin-II converting-enzyme activity (83%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively), induced dose-dependent decreases in mean blood pressure, did not significantly affect cardiac output, and reduced total peripheral and mesenteric vascular resistances to the same extent. Hindlimb vascular resistance was identically decreased, but to a lower extent than total peripheral resistance by enalaprilat, perindoprilat, and ramiprilat, whereas it was increased by captopril at low doses only. Renal resistance was markedly decreased by the four drugs, and especially by captopril. The decreasing rank order for ACE-inhibitor-induced vasodilation is exactly the same (renal greater than total peripheral = mesenteric greater than hindlimb vascular resistances) as that of angiotensin-H-induced regional vasoconstriction, indicating that the vasodilator properties of ACE inhibitors are mainly due to angiotensin-II vasomotor tone suppression. None of the investigated compounds significantly affected mesenteric and hindlimb blood flows, except captopril, which lowered the latter significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "347": "To evaluate the effect of enalapril on proteinuria, 16 normotensive type II diabetics with persistent proteinuria were studied. At random, the patients were allocated to enalapril (5 mg once a day) or placebo, in a double-blind fashion, for 12 months. Blood pressure, heart rate, urinary albumin excretion, plasma renin activity and aldosterone, blood glucose, serum fructosamine, urine urea and body weight were checked monthly during the run-in period and every 2 months during the treatment period. The kidney function was studied at the beginning of the study and during the sixth and 12th months. Enalapril decreased urinary albumin excretion in our patients in the absence of any effect on blood pressure and kidney function. Our data may be interpreted on the basis of a direct vascular effect of enalapril that is probably related to a tissue mechanism consisting of reduced angiotensin formation, increased kinins, or both, or of other unknown factors.", 
    "348": "The incidence of cough during treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was studied using retrospective analysis of outpatient records and a questionnaire; for a more precise evaluation, all reported cases of cough were reviewed according to criteria for the operational assessment of side effects, and those found unrelated were excluded. Cough during treatment with ACE inhibitors appears to be more frequent than previously recorded and substantial differences between patients treated with captopril or enalapril seem unlikely.", 
    "349": "Spirapril is a new non-sulphydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which is eliminated mainly through the liver. In a placebo-controlled study the acute and chronic (2 weeks) antihypertensive effects of two doses of spirapril (12.5 and 25 mg) were assessed by invasive 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in two groups of eight hypertensive subjects. After the first doses of 12.5 and 25 mg, blood pressure rapidly decreased, with a nadir after 4-6 h. At this time, mean arterial pressure was decreased by 24 +/- 2% with the 12.5 and 19 +/- 1% with the 25-mg dose. The antihypertensive response was sustained for almost the whole 24-h period with the 25-mg dose, but it was attenuated during the second half of the 24-h blood pressure monitoring with the 12.5-mg dose, leaving a residual antihypertensive effect of 6 +/- 2% 24 h after dosing. Compared with the response to the first dose, the antihypertensive response after 2 weeks of treatment was similar to that following the 12.5-mg dose, but with the 25-mg dose the response during the second half of the 24-h monitoring period, especially during the night, was attenuated. The reason for this attenuated antihypertensive response during prolonged ACE inhibition remains to be established.", 
    "350": "To verify the hypothesis that the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level may affect the metabolism of circulating atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), the acute and chronic effects of benazepril on plasma ANF levels were studied in hypertensive patients under basal conditions and in response to acute volume expansion. Ten essential hypertensives entered a double-blind crossover study, and were randomly allocated either to placebo or to 10 mg benazepril orally once a day for 2 days; after a placebo washout period of 2 days the groups were crossed over. On the second day of each crossover period, volume expansion was induced by infusing 1 litre saline in 30 min, and blood samples for ANF measurements were drawn at times -5, 0, 5, 15, 30, 35, 40, 50 and 60 min. Oral benazepril at 10 mg/day was then given to all patients for 4 weeks, and the volume expansion with saline was repeated. After the 2-day acute benazepril treatment, blood pressure fell from 166.1 +/- 3.6/105.1 +/- 0.9 to 140.1 +/- 4.6/85.6 +/- 2.1 mmHg (P less than 0.01 for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure), whereas ANF fell from 29.4 +/- 3.6 to 24.1 +/- 3.7 pg/ml (NS) after the acute benazepril treatment and to 17.7 +/- 3.6 pg/ml (P less than 0.01) after the chronic benazepril treatment. The volume expansion itself did not induce significant changes in mean arterial pressure, either during the placebo treatment or during the acute chronic benazepril treatment. The rise in ANF values in response to saline infusion during placebo was prompt, beginning at min 15 and reaching a maximum at min 40.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "351": "Since angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) metabolizes bradykinin, the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitors could be partly due to an increased bradykinin activity. We therefore investigated the influence of HOE K86-4321 [D-Arg-(Hyp2-Thi5,8-DPhe7)-bradykinin], a selective bradykinin-2 receptor antagonist, on the effects of enalaprilat (0.3 and 3.0 mg/kg) and zofenoprilat (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) on the heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance in rats. Both enalaprilat and zofenoprilat reduced mean arterial pressure (from 110 +/- 7 to 85 +/- 6 and from 108 +/- 9 to 72 +/- 9 mmHg, respectively; P less than 0.05) and total peripheral resistance (from 515 +/- 35 to 413 +/- 29 and from 495 +/- 45 to 310 +/- 25 x 10(-3) mmHg/litre per min per kg, respectively; P less than 0.05); the heart rate and cardiac output changed little. In the presence of HOE K86-4321, which by itself did not affect the haemodynamic variables measured, the effects of the two ACE inhibitors were significantly reduced. These results suggest that bradykinin-2 receptor-mediated vasodilation, although not involved in blood pressure regulation, influences the reduction in blood pressure induced by enalaprilat and zofenoprilat in normotensive rats. Furthermore, at comparable ACE-inhibiting doses, zofenoprilat was more effective in reducing mean arterial pressure, which might be related to the presence of a sulphydryl group.", 
    "352": "We evaluated the usefulness of an integrated concentration-effect modelling technique in predicting the long-term response to antihypertensive therapy with enalapril and nifedipine. Two groups of essential hypertensives were given monotherapy with 20 mg nifedipine twice a day (n = 14) or 20 mg enalapril once a day (n = 13), and were studied following the administration of the drugs and after at least 6 weeks' treatment. For both drugs the predicted responses (predose and 4 h postdose) were in close agreement with the observed responses. With enalapril the observed and predicted profiles over a 12-h study period were well correlated in all subjects. In contrast, with nifedipine, although there was generally good agreement, the model over-predicted the profile of response in one patient and under-predicted the profile in one patient. Thus, there is evidence that application of concentration-effect analysis is useful in predicting the steady-state antihypertensive effect from the first dose-response to the drug.", 
    "353": "We measured the effective renal plasma flow, the glomerular filtration rate and the fractional excretion of sodium under low and high sodium intakes in the normotensive offspring of hypertensives and in essential hypertensive patients. During the high sodium intake, 57% of the offspring and 42% of the hypertensive patients showed an increase in effective renal plasma flow and fractional excretion of sodium. In the remaining hypertensives, enalapril improved the renal haemodynamic and sodium-handling responses. Enalapril also reduced the blood pressure in all hypertensives, whether they showed a normal or an abnormal response to a high sodium intake. In the hypertensive patients with an abnormal response to a high sodium intake, the intra-erythrocyte sodium content was higher than in the normal responders. Thus, abnormal renal haemodynamic and sodium-handling responses to a high sodium intake were observed in 50% of the hypertensive patients and the offspring. The high intra-erythrocyte sodium content observed in the hypertensive patients suggests that extrarenal alterations in sodium handling were present.", 
    "354": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril was used to examine the effects of inhibition, regression and redevelopment of hypertension on the ploidy of aortic smooth muscle cells in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The incidence of polyploidy cells, as determined by flow cytometric DNA analysis, directly paralleled changes in systolic blood pressure. When the development of hypertension was inhibited by treatment with enalapril, the incidence of polyploid cells remained low compared with untreated age-matched SHR. Likewise, when the blood pressure of hypertensive animals was lowered by enalapril treatment, the incidence of polyploid cells decreased. Addition of enalapril to primary cultures of smooth muscle had no direct effect on proliferation or the incidence of polyploidy. These results suggest that angiotensin II may be involved in the development of vascular smooth muscle polyploidy in vivo, either by a direct effect on the cells or indirectly by elevating blood pressure or by potentiation of sympathetic discharge.", 
    "355": "The synthesis and biological activity of novel L-lysyl-N-substituted glycine derivatives which exhibit in vitro and in vivo angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, are described. Particularly, N-[N alpha-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-L-lysyl]-N-(4-phenylcyclohexyl)glycine (11e), N-[N alpha-(1-carboxy-3-cyclopentylpropyl)-N epsilon-carbobenzoxy-L- lysyl]-N-cyclopentyl glycine (9h) and N-[N alpha-[1(S)-carboxy-3-cyclohexylpropyl]-L-lysyl]-N-cyclopentyl glycine (19a) showed a strong inhibitory activity at IC50 as low as 0.65, 0.64 and 0.11 nmol/l, respectively. The most potent activity in vivo was observed with the compound 19a after i.v. administration in the rat.", 
    "356": "Blood pressure was continuously monitored over 24 h in 201 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension using a noninvasive method. Measurements were made both before and after 6 months of antihypertensive treatment and the data were compared to results from 100 normotensive patients. The frequency with which blood pressure values above 140/90 mm Hg occurred during the 24-h period proved to be the most reliable parameter for distinguishing between hypertensive and normotensive profiles. The blood pressures of all patients could be normalized (less than 140/90 mm Hg) on single or combined drug therapy as assessed by casual measurement. However, significant differences were observed between the 24-h profiles of the treated patients and the control group. The mean 24-h blood pressure, the mean day and nighttime blood pressures, the mean hourly pressure, and the frequency of increased blood pressure values were all significantly higher in the patients on medication as compared to the normotensive controls. This would suggest that normotension, as defined by the control group, cannot be attained with antihypertensive medication. In conclusion, 24-h continuous blood pressure monitoring allows a better evaluation of blood pressure profiles and consequently, will be of greater value in assessing cardiovascular risk than occasional random measurements.", 
    "357": "Sensory and behavioral performance of three normotensive and one renovascular hypertensive baboon was tested before, during and following chronic oral dosing with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. Performance measurements during a five-color simultaneous matching to sample task were obtained during enalapril dosing of 0.18 and 0.61 mg/kg/day, and vehicle. Each dose was administered for 21 consecutive days preceded and followed by 14 baseline and recovery periods, respectively. BP from awake animals as well as serum ACE activity were measured. Systolic BPs decreased by a maximum of 6-8% (8 mmHg). ACE activity was decreased in a dose-dependent fashion by 54.01% and 81.63% for 0.18 mg/kg and 0.61 mg/kg doses, respectively. At 0.61 mg/kg, the duration of simple key-press motor behavior increased by 15% in the first week and then progressively returned to baseline levels. Systematic changes in choice reaction times or color discrimination accuracy were not observed. Although the renovascular hypertensive baboon displayed greater hypotension and ACE inhibition, behavioral effects were not significantly different from normotensive baboons. The present study extends to sensory functions the lack of adverse behavioral side-effects of enalapril.", 
    "358": "The intestinal absorption mechanism of two ACE inhibitor prodrugs, enalapril and fosinopril, was investigated in rats using a single-pass perfusion method. A modified boundary layer solution was applied to determine the apparent intestinal wall permeability. The prodrug enalapril is well absorbed from rat jejunum, whereas the parent drug, enalaprilat, is poorly absorbed. The permeability of enalapril is concentration dependent and is decreased by the dipeptide Tyr-Gly and by cephradine but not by the amino acids L-leucine or L-phenylalanine, indicating a nonpassive absorption mechanism via the small peptide carrier-mediated transport system. In contrast, fosinopril is readily absorbed by a concentration-independent mechanism without the involvement of the peptide carrier.", 
    "359": "The intestinal absorption mechanism of two nonsulfhydril lysyl-proline angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, lisinopril (1) and SQ 29,852 (2; [(S)-1-[6-amino-2-[[hydroxy (4-phenylbutyl)-phosphinyl]oxy[-1-oxohexyl]-L-proline) were investigated in rats using a single-pass perfusion method. Compound 2 is well absorbed from rat jejunum, whereas lisinopril absorption is relatively low. The permeability of both ACE inhibitors is concentration dependent and is decreased by the dipeptide Tyr-Gly and by cephradine, indicating a nonpassive absorption mechanism via the peptide carrier-mediated transport system. Compound 2 is well absorbed by a nonpassive mechanism, in parallel with a small passive component. The estimated dimensionless carrier parameters for 2 are J*max = 0.16, Km = 0.08 mM, P*c = 2.0, and P*m = 0.25; for lisinopril, passive absorption is not significant and its absorption is nonpassive: J*max = 0.032, Km = 0.082 mM, and P*c = 0.39 (where J*max is the maximal flux, Km is the Michaelis constant, P*c is the carrier permeability, and P*m is the passive permeability). These results offer a mechanistic explanation for the prolonged ACE inhibition and the low oral bioavailability of lisinopril, and for the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of 2.", 
    "360": "These experiments tested whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) located within the subfornical organ (SFO) participates in the generation of water intake during peripheral ACE blockade with captopril (CAP). Lesions of the SFO virtually abolished drinking in response to intraperitoneal CAP injection. Intracranially injected CAP suppressed drinking induced by intraperitoneal CAP more completely with direct SFO injection compared with intraventricular or control tissue injections. This central captopril treatment did not alter the drinking response to subcutaneous hypertonic saline. Intraventricular injections of the angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor blocker sarile reduced drinking during oral captopril treatment in rats rehydrating from water deprivation. The results indicate that (a) the SFO mediates drinking caused by peripheral ACE inhibition; (b) the ACE located within the SFO may locally convert ANG I to ANG II, which then stimulates thirst; and (c) central ANG II receptors mediate thirst caused by peripheral ACE inhibition.", 
    "361": "We studied the effects of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor thiorphan (1.7 mg/kg iv) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (5.7 mg/kg iv) on airway responses to rapid intravenous infusions of neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. The dose of NKA required to decrease pulmonary conductance to 50% of its base-line value (ED50GL) was fivefold less (P less than 0.0001) in animals treated with thiorphan compared with controls. NKA1-8, a product resulting from cleavage of NKA by NEP, had no bronchoconstrictor activity. Similar results were obtained by using NKB as the bronchoconstricting agent. Captopril had no significant effect on airway responses to NKA or NKB. In contrast, both thiorphan and captopril decrease the ED50GL for substance P (SP). We also compared the relative bronchoconstrictor potency of NKA, NKB, and SP. In control animals, the rank order of ED50GL values was NKA much less than NKB = SP. NKA also caused a more prolonged bronchoconstriction than SP or NKB. Thiorphan had no effect on the rank order of bronchoconstrictor potency, but in animals treated with captopril, the rank order of ED50GL values was altered to NKA less than SP less than NKB. These results suggest that degradation of NKA and NKB by NEP but not by ACE is an important determinant of the bronchoconstriction induced by these peptides. The degradation by ACE of SP but not NKA or NKB influences the observed relative potency of the three tachykinins as bronchoactive agents.", 
    "362": "The effect of long-term treatment with either enalapril or high dose verapamil on survival, proteinuria, blood pressure and renal morphology was studied in female Wistar rats with markedly reduced renal mass. Four weeks were allowed for remnant kidney hypertrophy before determining the response to renal ablation of individual animals regarding proteinuria and hypertension. At this time, five groups of 18 rats were formed with equal levels of proteinuria and hypertension. Groups E1 and E2 were treated with enalapril, groups V1 and V2 with verapamil, and one group served as control. The daily food allowance was 14 g/rat of a standard rat diet, containing 30% protein and 100 mmol NaCl/kg food in groups E1 and V1. NaCl content was reduced to 20 mmol/kg food in groups E2, V2 and control. The drugs were added to the drinking water, enalapril at a dose of 0.1 g/liter, verapamil at 0.5 to 0.7 g/liter. Drug intake thus amounted to 10 to 25 mg/kg for enalapril and 50 to 140 mg/kg for verapamil. Treatment was continued for 15 weeks. Three of the 18 control rats did not survive up to 15 weeks. Mortality was lower in the enalapril treated groups with a single nonsurvivor in group E1. In contrast, mortality was higher in the verapamil treated animals with seven nonsurvivors in group V1 and eight in group V2. Blood pressure control was excellent in both enalapril treated groups. and proteinuria decreased in most animals of group E1 and all of group 22. Glomerulosclerosis did not develop in the majority of the enalapril treated animals. Despite the high dose, verapamil barely lowered blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "363": "Rapid-pressor and slow-pressor responses to angiotensin (ANG) II and norepinephrine (NE) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto control rats (WKY) were examined. All animals were treated from 4 wk of age with captopril (100 mg/kg/day in drinking water) to prevent development of hypertension so that changes in responsiveness could not be attributed to disparate base-line blood pressures or to hypertension-induced injury of the cardiovascular system. In 11-wk, conscious, unrestrained, captopril-treated rats, ANG II and NE induced rapid-pressor responses (i.e., a rapid increase in arterial blood pressure that reached a maximum within 10 min) that were of similar magnitude in SHR and WKY. In an additional group of 9-wk captopril-treated rats, both ANG II and NE caused slow-pressor responses (i.e., a slow increase in arterial blood pressure over 2 wk). Although the slow-pressor response to NE was similar in SHR versus WKY, the slow-pressor response to ANG II was much greater in SHR compared with WKY. Further studies were conducted in captopril-treated (from 4 wk of age) SHR and WKY to investigate whether the increased slow-pressor response to ANG II in SHR was mediated by an enhanced ability of ANG II to potentiate peripheral sympathetic neurotransmission, contract vascular smooth muscle, increase sympathetic tone to nonadrenal sites, release aldosterone, and/or reduce renal function. No evidence was found that supported a role for the aforementioned nonrenal actions of ANG II. However, 11-wk captopril-treated SHR were 10-fold more sensitive to the antidiuretic, antinatriuretic, and renal vascular effects of intrarenal infusions of ANG II compared with captopril-treated WKY. Also, chronic (1 wk) intrarenal infusions of a very low dose of ANG II (1 ng/min) caused a marked slow-pressor response in 11-wk captopril-treated SHR but did not alter arterial blood pressure in WKY. We conclude that 1) the slow-pressor response to ANG II is greatly enhanced in SHR, 2) this enhancement is specific with respect to type of response (slow not rapid) and pressor agent (ANG II not NE), 3) a genetic defect underlies the increased slow-pressor response to ANG II in SHR, and 4) the enhanced slow-pressor response to ANG II contributes significantly to the pathophysiology of hypertension in SHR. Finally, the current studies are consistent with our working hypothesis that the kidneys mediate the enhanced slow-pressor response to ANG II in SHR.", 
    "364": "The relative contribution of plasma carboxypeptidase N (kininase I), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (kininase II), neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase A) and postproline cleaving enzyme to total kininase activity in rat plasma was determined by measuring bradykinin hydrolysis with and without various concentrations of inhibitors of these enzymes. We used DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethyl-thiopropanoic acid to inhibit kininase I, enalaprilat for ACE, phosphoramidon for neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-prolinal for postproline cleaving enzyme. Bradykinin was added to rat plasma and incubated at 37 degrees C. Kininase activity was evaluated based on the decrease in bradykinin during incubation. Bradykinin was measured by radioimmunoassay, using an antibody that recognizes its carboxyl group. Of the total plasma kininase activity, carboxypeptidase N was responsible for 11.0 +/- 2.5% (N = 5; P less than .05) and ACE for 46.8 +/- 1.5% (N = 5; P less than .001), whereas the contribution of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and postproline cleaving enzyme turned out to be negligible. Of the kininase activity in rat plasma, 42% could not be explained by any of these four enzymes. We concluded that ACE is responsible for most of the kininase activity in rat plasma; carboxypeptidase N contributes to a slight degree. The fact that 42% of total plasma kininase activity could not be explained by any of the enzymes tested suggests that there are still other kininases in rat plasma which remain to be discovered.", 
    "365": "An isolated recirculating or single pass red cell-perfused rat kidney preparation (IPK) was used to examine the differential handling of renal metabolites. In single pass experiments, enalapril was primarily metabolized to its polar, dicarboxylic acid metabolite, enalaprilat, and its fractional excretion (FE) was less than unity, suggesting net reabsorption. Its steady-state extraction ratio decreased from 0.3 to 0.2 at concentrations of 1.06 to 12.7 microM, due to a saturation of enzymes for esterolysis. Enalaprilat administered to the IPK was excreted into urine in a concentration-independent (0.41-35.3 microM) fashion, with FE values approximating unity, suggesting net filtration. Differences in handling were observed for enalaprilat, as a metabolite formed from enalapril and as an administered (preformed) species in the single pass IPK, when tracer concentrations of [14C]enalapril and [3H]enalaprilat were given simultaneously. A comparison made between steady-state extraction ratio Ess[mi] [generated metabolite]/glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and Ess[pmi] [preformed metabolite]/GFR, respectively, revealed a 2-fold difference. The finding suggests the presence of a barrier for entry of enalaprilat into the kidney. Or else, in absence of the barrier, the opposite would be observed, that is, Ess [pmi]/GFR greater than Ess [mi]/GFR because preformed enalaprilat, in contrast to generated enalaprilat, undergoes filtration and utilizes facilitative transport carriers at the basolateral membrane. In recirculating IPKs which received simultaneously a tracer bolus dose of [14C]enalapril and [3H]enalaprilat, the FE values for generated [14C]enalaprilat were high and variable, decreasing with perfusion time and exceeding those for preformed [3H]enalaprilat, which approached unity with perfusion time. The variable FE values for [14C]enalaprilat are due to time-dependent contributions of circulating enalaprilat (which behaves identically to preformed enalaprilat) and the intrarenally generated enalaprilat. Hence, with renal drug metabolism, the conventional method of estimating urinary clearance (or Fe[mi]) for the metabolite [(total) excretion rate/midpoint plasma FE[mi] metabolite concentration] results in a greater metabolite clearance than that predicted from the administration of preformed metabolite.", 
    "366": "The calcium ion is recognized as having a ubiquitous role in a wide range of physiological responses. The calcium entry blockers have assumed a greater role than first thought possible in the management of cardiovascular disorders. As a group, they have multiple effects and can be tailored to meet specific needs. The drugs are well tolerated, thus making them useful for chronic administration. The efficacy of the calcium entry blockers can be enhanced when combined with other therapies such as beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme as applied to patients with hypertension, angina pectoris, or both. The range of indications and potential uses of the calcium entry blockers demands an understanding of the role of the slow inward current in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. This review focuses on the pharmacological actions of the calcium entry blockers and relates these events to their clinical applications in an effort to achieve an understanding of their multiple therapeutic uses.", 
    "367": "A retrospective analysis of records from an outpatient medical practice was undertaken to determine the incidence and features of cough resulting from the use of enalapril maleate. Of 209 patients taking enalapril, 22 (10.5%) required discontinuation of therapy because of an intractable, dry cough. Cough was more than twice as common in women; 16 (14.6%) of 109 women and 6 (6%) of 100 men stopped taking enalapril because of cough. The cough resolved in 21 of 22 patients within 2 weeks of discontinuation of enalapril therapy. When the patients with cough were compared with the others, there was no significant difference in age, smoking status, creatinine levels, enalapril dosage, associated cardiopulmonary disease, or concomitant administration of medications. Among the 187 study patients who did not discontinue taking enalapril because of cough, many developed a persistent, dry cough that to date has not been severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy, after a mean follow-up period of 16 months. The enalapril-induced cough is insidious, dry, persistent, benign, and reversible on discontinuation of therapy. It is important to distinguish enalapril-induced cough from cough resulting from acute illness, reactive airway disease, and congestive heart failure. Optimal clinical application of enalapril in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure will require increased awareness of this incessant cough, which requires discontinuation of the therapy in about 10% of patients.", 
    "368": "Measurement of serum angiotensin-converting-enzyme (SACE) is the most useful test for diagnosing and monitoring disease activity in sarcoidosis. Because elevated levels of SACE are not specific for sarcoidosis, other conditions in which SACE levels are also elevated are examined.", 
    "369": "The extent to which the natriuretic effect of a prolonged low dose infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (30 ng/kg/min) is dependent on interference with the prevailing intrarenal actions of angiotensin II was examined before and after blockade of angiotensin production with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (5 mg/kg). Lithium clearance was used to assess proximal tubular sodium and water reabsorption. Atrial natriuretic factor and enalaprilat caused similar increases in sodium excretion (10-fold and sevenfold, respectively) and glomerular filtration rate (each 34%) and similar decreases in fractional proximal reabsorption of sodium (17% and 13%, respectively) and blood pressure. Each also caused a major disruption in the effectiveness of proximal glomerulotubular balance (30% and 50% of perfect balance). Infusion of atrial natriuretic factor during converting enzyme inhibition increased glomerular filtration rate further by 23%, reaching 63% above control without change in renal blood flow but with a rise in filtration fraction to 0.48. Sodium excretion increased further but fractional proximal sodium reabsorption remained constant and proximal glomerulotubular balance appeared to improve. Atrial natriuretic factor therefore possesses a glomerular action that persists during converting enzyme inhibition and is indeed additive to the removal of angiotensin II when the proximal effect of atrial natriuretic factor is no longer apparent. It is concluded that failure of atrial natriuretic factor to further suppress fractional proximal sodium reabsorption during converting enzyme inhibition is caused by either prior removal of the stimulatory action of angiotensin II on proximal tubular transport or extreme changes in peritubular physical factors consequent on the high filtration fraction.", 
    "370": "To evaluate the relationship between the elevation of blood pressure and altered bone metabolism, the changes of systolic blood pressure in six experimental models for bone disorders were investigated. Rats used were either parathyroidectomized, ovariectomized, fed with a calcium-deficient diet, fed with a vitamin D-deficient diet, treated with HEBP (1-Hydroxyethylidene-1, 1-bisphosphonate) or treated with streptozotocin. Hypertension developed in 5-week-old male rats fed with a calcium-deficient diet for 2 weeks, which evoked hypocalcemia and nutritional hyperparathyroidism. The blood pressure returned to normal when fed with a normal calcium diet. In parathyroidectomized rats receiving a normal calcium diet, the blood pressure did not rise, though the plasma calcium level decreased to an extent similar to the rats fed with the calcium-deficient diet. These findings seem to indicate that hyperparathyroidism, but not hypocalcemia, was involved in the elevation of blood pressure in rats fed with a calcium-deficient diet. Hypertension was not observed in rats fed with a vitamin D-deficient diet or treated with streptozotocin. These rats showed not only an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) but also a decrease in 1,25 (OH)2 D3. These results may suggest that the presence of 1,25 (OH)2D3 as well as the enhanced parathyroid function is necessary for the development of hypertension. The elevated blood pressure was reduced by a calcium antagonist, nifedipine, or by calcium supplementation, but not by an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, captopril, or by calcitonin. This may indicate that hypertension due to nutritional hyperparathyroidism responds to the calcium antagonist nifedipine and to calcium supplementation, but does not depend on renin or salt. Furthermore, an acute hypotensive effect by human PTH (1-34) was not observed in the hypertension of calcium-deficient rats, suggesting the difference between acute and chronic effects of PTH. The hypertension developed in the present experiment may be a useful model for pharmacological evaluation of antihypertensive drugs, such as calcium and calcium antagonists.", 
    "371": "We investigated the influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril on cardiac arrhythmias in guinea pigs and rats. Ramiprilat, the active moiety of ramipril, did not influence action potentials of isolated guinea-pig papillary muscle or rabbit sinus node, thereby excluding cellular electrophysiological evidence of anti-arrhythmic properties. Ramipril protected against cardiac arrhythmias induced by digoxin infusion in guinea pigs. This effect was comparable with that of lidocaine. In isolated perfused ischemic working rat hearts, angiotensin (ANG) I (3 x 10(-9) M/l) and ANG II (1 x 10(-9) M/l) aggravated reperfusion arrhythmias, accompanied by deterioration of cardiodynamic and metabolic events. Bradykinin (BK) (1 x 10(-10)-1 x 10(-8) M/l), in contrast, protected against reperfusion arrhythmias, which corresponded to an increase in energy-rich phosphates and glycogen stores and a decrease in lactate levels in myocardial tissue. Identical changes were seen in hearts from rats pretreated with ramipril (1 mg/kg PO) or perfused with ramiprilat (2.58 x 10(-7)-2.58 x 10(-5) M/l). Local ACE inhibition in these ischemic hearts antagonized ANG I but not ANG II effects and enhanced BK effects. The BK antagonist D-Arg-(Hyp2, Thi5,8, D-Phe7)BK abolished the beneficial effects of BK, ramipril, and ramiprilat. Increased concentrations of BK or ramiprilat were able to reverse the antagonism. The antiarrhythmic agent nicainoprol, a fast-sodium-channel blocking drug (class Ib), also protected isolated rat hearts against reperfusion arrhythmias, but was without beneficial effects on cardiac hemodynamics and biochemical parameters, in contrast to the ACE inhibitor. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril on digoxin and reperfusion arrhythmias are not mediated by their direct actions on ionic channels in the cell membrane. It seems that other factors are responsible for its beneficial effects on reperfusion arrhythmias, cardiac function, and metabolism, which are associated with a reduction in ANG II generation and BK degradation by local ACE inhibition in the heart.", 
    "372": "We studied the distribution of four isoenzymes of creatine-kinase (MM, MB, BB and the mitochondrial) in 13 renovascular hypertensive rats and five age-matched controls. After 6 weeks of hypertension, seven rats were treated with captopril (2 mg/kg daily) for 4 weeks and the other six were left untreated for 4 weeks. After the rats were killed an adaptive increase in MB and BB was found at the expense of MM in the hypertensive rats compared with the controls. The captopril-treated rats displayed persistently higher levels of both MB and BB than the controls. Therefore, the regression in cardiac hypertrophy that is achieved by captopril is accompanied by persistence of the isoenzymic pattern that leads to better use of energy-rich phosphates.", 
    "373": "In seven patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, the effect of a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril, on atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was examined at rest and during exercise. The exercise protocol consisted of three fixed workloads (25, 50 and 75W) every 4 min with the use of a sitting bicycle ergometer. Cilazapril reduced blood pressure without increasing the heart rate, both at rest and during exercise. The resting pre-exercise left ventricular ejection fraction was not altered. The plasma ANF level was increased by exercise, but at the 75-W workload it was decreased by cilazapril; the resting plasma ANF value was not altered. At the 75-W workload the plasma ANF level was inversely correlated to the left ventricular ejection fraction (n = 14, r = -0.64, P less than 0.01). These results suggest that the observed decrease in the plasma ANF level during exercise induced by cilazapril is, in part, related to an improvement in the cardiac overload, and that cilazapril may be effective in physically active hypertensive patients.", 
    "374": "To investigate whether aldosterone responses to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition are affected by changes in atrial natriuretic factor, which is known to inhibit aldosterone secretion, we measured blood pressure, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic factor and plasma potassium before and after 1 week of treatment with fosenopril, a long-acting ACE inhibitor, in eight normotensive subjects. Fosenopril caused a slight fall in blood pressure and increased plasma renin activity in all subjects. In contrast, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic factor were, on average, unchanged. However, for both these hormones a wide range of individual responses was observed (aldosterone from -254 to +240 pmol/l, atrial natriuretic factor from +9.7 to -16.6 pmol/l) and a significant inverse correlation was found between the changes in aldosterone and those in atrial natriuretic factor (r = -0.73, P less than 0.05). Plasma potassium was unchanged after the fosenopril treatment. These findings suggest an inter-relationship between atrial natriuretic factor and the aldosterone responses to short-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "375": "The role of the heart in hypertension has finally emerged as a major issue of cardiovascular concern by the clinician, physiologist, pharmacologist, biochemist, and molecular biologist. This discussion provides an overview of the present state of knowledge and current areas of investigation in this active area of broad interest. Generally, these relate to: the active participation of the heart (e.g. hemodynamic, humoral, autocrine/paracrine); the adaptive response of the heart (i.e. hemodynamic); non-hemodynamic relationships (vis-a-vis, age, race, gender, humoral, coexistent disease); and current thoughts on mechanisms of so-called regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Several antihypertensive classes of compounds are characterized by decreasing cardiac mass and left ventricular wall thicknesses. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are included among these agents; their physiological effects in producing \"regression\" are under active study as are the mechanisms responsible for these changes. These concerns are no longer of incidental or theoretical interest but have major impact on selection of antihypertensive therapy and the management of the patient with hypertension. Thus, the heart may participate actively in the pathogenesis and maintenance of the disease; it adapts to the vascular disease hemodynamically; but in this regard the response has both positive beneficial concerns as well as negative implications as an independent risk factor. These latter concerns should be explored in great depth before conclusions are made with respect to the long-term implications of antihypertensive therapy on the heart.", 
    "376": "In 14 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) of various grade (NYHA class 2-4) the effects of zofenopril calcium (SQ 26,991) on blood pressure and forearm circulation were studied by venous occlusion plethysmography. Changes in plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) were also measured. Two hours after oral administration of 7.5 mg of zofenopril we observed a decrease in blood pressure, heart rate, and forearm vascular resistance along with an increase in venous distensibility. Zofenopril also decreased ANP levels in a manner directly related to peripheral venodilatation (r = .64; P less than .05) and modified arginine-vasopressin (AVP) proportionally to the fall in blood pressure observed in response to drug administration (%SBP/%AVP: r = .64, P less than .05; %DBP/%AVP: r = .67, P less than .05). Hemodynamic and humoral responses to zofenopril occurred without any significant unwanted adverse reaction, even in patients with greater pressor reduction. We conclude that oral acute zofenopril administration, in patients with congestive heart failure, causes an arterial and venous forearm vasodilatation which is probably involved in the acute changes in plasma levels of ANF and AVP observed after drug administration.", 
    "377": "1. The acute effects of intravenous frusemide (30 mg) on prostaglandin dependent renal haemodynamics, urinary prostaglandin excretion, urinary dopamine excretion and electrolyte excretion were studied in six salt replete healthy volunteers with and without pretreatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril (5 mg) and compared with the effects of ramipril alone in order to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system in these responses. 2. Frusemide increased natriuresis (UNaV), kaliuresis (UKV), inulin clearance and plasma renin activity (PRA) and ramipril pretreatment significantly enhanced these effects suggesting that the acute generation of angiotensin II (AII) may attenuate these actions of intravenous frusemide. 3. Frusemide increased para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance, osmolar clearance and urine flow but did not change filtration fraction or urinary kallikrein excretion. Pretreatment with ramipril did not affect these responses. 4. Frusemide increased the excretion of urinary PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Ramipril pretreatment did not suppress this rise in prostaglandin excretion. Since the frusemide induced prostaglandin dependent renal haemodynamic changes were also not suppressed with ACE inhibition, this suggests that in salt-replete volunteers AII does not significantly modulate renal prostaglandin production after frusemide. 5. Urinary free dopamine excretion increased with frusemide alone. With ramipril pretreatment this rise showed a tendency to increase. AII may therefore inhibit the rise in urinary dopamine excretion after frusemide. However this requires further study.", 
    "378": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common sequela of long-standing essential hypertension. LVH cannot be considered, however, an adaptive process only serving to normalize wall stress but can be considered one that significantly increases the risk of sudden death, myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases. Patients with LVH exhibit impaired ventricular filling, ventricular arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia even in the absence of coronary artery disease. LVH can be prevented or reversed by a variety of antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Calcium channel blockers, more than angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, suppress ectopic impulse generation, improve ventricular compliance, and alleviate myocardial ischemia while preserving or improving the contractile state. In contrast, ACE inhibitors can be particularly useful in patients with LVH and diminished ventricular contractility and in preventing chamber dilatation after myocardial infarct. These favorable cardiovascular effects of both calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors are a reason for optimism that carefully tailored therapy will ultimately diminish the well-documented risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with LVH.", 
    "379": "Atrial natriuretic peptide levels are elevated in heart failure. However, the hemodynamic responses to exogenous atrial natriuretic peptide infusion in heart failure are blunted. To determine if captopril can restore hemodynamic responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide infusion in rats with heart failure, studies were performed in a rat model of heart failure after coronary artery ligation. Rats with heart failure received either captopril (2 g/l drinking water) or placebo for 4 weeks and then were treated with an infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide (0.3 microgram/kg/min). Captopril treatment alone improved hemodynamics. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, mean aortic pressure, and mean circulatory filling pressure decreased from 22 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 1, from 106 +/- 4 to 76 +/- 3, and from 10.5 +/- 0.6 to 8.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, respectively. Heart rate, right atrial pressure, and hematocrit were unchanged. Total blood volume decreased from 66.0 +/- 1.0 to 60.0 +/- 1.0 ml/kg; venous compliance increased from 2.1 +/- 0.1 to 2.7 +/- 0.1 ml/kg/mm Hg. Atrial natriuretic peptide alone had minimal hemodynamic effects on rats with heart failure. There was no change in right atrial pressure, mean aortic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, mean circulatory filling pressure, and total blood volume. However, atrial natriuretic peptide infusion increased venous compliance from 2.1 +/- 0.1 to 2.4 +/- 0.1 ml/kg/mm Hg. Heart rate and hematocrit increased from 323 +/- 5 to 359 +/- 8 beats/min and from 48 +/- 1% to 51 +/- 1%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "380": "Chronic hypertension is associated with a lower cerebral vascular reserve due to thickening of the media of cerebral vessels. The goal of the present study was to determine if long-term inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with cilazapril, a new long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, could improve cerebral vascular reserve. For this purpose, two groups of 12 spontaneously hypertensive rats were compared. One group was treated with 10 mg/kg/day cilazapril from 14 weeks to 33 weeks of age and was compared with a group treated with placebo. A third group of 12 Wistar-Kyoto rats treated with placebo was used as reference. At the end of the treatment period, cerebral vascular reserve was evaluated by measuring cerebral blood flow (radioactive microspheres) at rest and during maximal vasodilation induced by seizures provoked by bicuculline. Then, the rats were perfusion-fixed, and morphometry of the cerebral vasculature was performed. Cerebral vascular reserve was severely impaired in the spontaneously hypertensive rats since their maximal cerebral blood flow was decreased by 52% compared with the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Cilazapril normalized cerebral blood flow reserve. This normalization was associated with a decreased thickness of the medial layer in the carotid artery, the middle cerebral artery, and in the pial arteries larger than 100 microns. Further studies are required to determine whether this decreased medial thickness is due to the normalization of blood pressure induced by cilazapril or to the reduction of trophic factors such as angiotensin II.", 
    "381": "The treatment of hypertension by costly new drugs such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, means that careful monitoring of health care expenditure is essential.

    "382": "While ACE inhibitors are considerably more expensive than thiazide diuretics, they are slightly more effective antihypertensive agents in white patients and have fewer side effects. They can be regarded as suitable first-line therapy in diabetic hypertensives. It is probable that as new drugs in this class are marketed, the price differential will lessen and they will be regarded as acceptable and useful first-line drugs in an increasingly large number of patients.", 
    "383": "The development of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been important in furthering our understanding of the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure and improving the care of these patients. ACE inhibitors have been shown to improve the longevity and quality of life of patients with congestive heart failure. They decrease neurohumoral over-activation, they restore baroreceptor reactivity, and in many cases they increase sodium and water excretion. If hypovolemia and an excessive decrease in renal perfusion pressure can be avoided, ACE inhibitors generally do not cause a deterioration of renal function and may even improve it. By decreasing myocardial metabolic demand, ACE inhibitors appear to have generally beneficial effects on myocardial metabolic balance. At low perfusion pressures, they also appear to maintain cerebral blood flow.", 
    "384": "Arterial diameter, blood flow, and vascular resistance of the common carotid artery were studied together with the carotido-femoral pulse wave velocity in men with sustained essential hypertension before and after acute oral administration of either captopril or a hydralazinelike agent, cadralazine. The two drugs caused similar decreases in mean blood pressure and vascular resistance in the carotid area. While cadralazine did not change arterial diameter and pulse wave velocity, captopril caused a significant increase in arterial diameter and a decrease in pulse wave velocity. The study provided evidence that two drugs causing a similar reduction in blood pressure and dilatation of small arteries have different effects on the large common carotid artery. Only captopril caused an enhancement of arterial diameter and distensibility related to the pharmacologic action of the drug on the vascular wall.", 
    "385": "It has been reported that naloxone, an opiate receptor antagonist, blunts the hypotensive effect of captopril in normotensives. However, our previous data did not show any interaction between captopril given acutely and naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) in hypertensives. To test whether a greater naloxone dose could interfere with the hemodynamic effect of chronically administered captopril, 12 male hypertensives were studied: Six of them had been under captopril treatment (50 mg tid) for at least 1 month, whereas the others had been drug free for the same time. Both groups randomly received a saline or naloxone (0.2 mg/kg) infusion for 1 hour, and blood pressure, heart rate, PRA, plasma aldosterone, adrenaline, and noradrenaline were measured at regular intervals before, during, and after naloxone infusion. In drug-free hypertensives, naloxone tended to reduce blood pressure slightly and did not modify heart rate, PRA, plasma aldosterone, adrenaline, or noradrenaline. In captopril-treated hypertensives, naloxone did not blunt the hypotensive effect of captopril, but rather enhanced it, without changing the heart rate, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. Moreover, naloxone increased the renin-stimulating action and did not modify the aldosterone-inhibiting effect of captopril. Our results show that the hemodynamic action of captopril given chronically is not influenced by opioid receptor blockade and therefore that the antihypertensive effect of this drug seems to be unrelated to the activation of the opioidergic system.", 
    "386": "We compared the effect of nicardipine, a dihydropiridine derivative calcium entry blocker (CEB), with that of captopril (CAP), a converting-enzyme inhibitor (CEI), and that of the two drugs combined, on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and renal function in 12 hypertensive type II diabetic outpatients with nephropathy (persistent proteinuria greater than 500 mg/24 h) according to a 2 x 2 factorial design. For 4-week treatments, the patients received nicardipine (NIC) 20 mg t.i.d., CAP 50 mg b.i.d., NIC plus CAP, and matched placebo. Each active treatment significantly reduced BP, with an additive effect of NIC and CAP combined versus either drug alone. HR did not change. Effective renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GRF) were unmodified, but renal vascular resistances (RVRs) were significantly reduced by the three active treatments. Filtration fraction (FF) did not change with NIC or with NIC plus CAP and was significantly reduced with CAP. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was significantly reduced by each active treatment to a similar extent. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased significantly with NIC plus CAP only and did not change when the drugs were administered singly. Plasma aldosterone, glucose, potassium, fructosamine, and urinary sodium and volume did not change during the trial. We conclude that the two drugs singly and combined are useful for treatment of hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDD) patients with persistent proteinuria.", 
    "387": "A direct measurement of both angiotensins I and II immunoreactive substances was made in the perfusate from isolated human umbilical vein perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution which was free of any component of the renin-angiotensin system. The identity of the immunoreactive peptides was confirmed as angiotensin I and angiotensin II by high-performance liquid chromatography in reference to standard compounds. The rate of release of angiotensins was 41.9 +/- 7.4 and 63.4 +/- 12.0 pg for angiotensins I and II, respectively, during the first perfusion period of 30 min, and it remained stable at least for 3 hours. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, added to the perfusion medium (10(-9) to 5 x 10(-6) M), suppressed immunoreactive angiotensin II release in a dose-dependent fashion; the maximal percent inhibition of angiotensin II release evoked by captopril (5 x 10(-6) M) was approximately 56%. These results taken together with the previous observations of presence of essential components of the renin-angiotensin system in vascular tissue provide direct evidence for local generation and subsequent release of angiotensin II in vascular beds of human beings.", 
    "388": "To check the reliability of the captopril test and of quantitative radioisotope techniques for the primary diagnosis of renovascular hypertension the data from 41 patients suspected of this disease were retrospectively analysed. In all cases plasma renin activity (PRA) was assayed in peripheral blood and in renal vein blood before and after 25 mg captopril. Double tracer studies with 131I-hippuran and 99mTc-DTPA were also performed, as was renal arteriography. The postoperative blood pressure plots of 23 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis (who had subsequently been operated upon) were included in the evaluation. Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed in 21 patients and essential hypertension in 20. Twelve of the 20 patients with essential hypertension had renal artery stenosis, but this had not produced renovascular hypertension. The diagnostic significance of the tests as markers of renovascular hypertension was as follows: captopril test P less than 0.001, glomerular filtration fraction P less than 0.02, hippuran clearance P less than 0.001. The captopril test and the quantitative radioisotope techniques were in agreement in identifying patients with renal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension. False-positive results due to methodological shortcomings can be avoided by applying both methods in succession.", 
    "389": "In healthy volunteers the acute effect of furosemide (40 mg i.v.) and hydrochlorothiazide (100 mg p.o.) on diuresis, natriuresis and renal kallikrein and kinin excretion was investigated. Furosemide stimulated markedly diuresis and natriuresis as well as urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion. Pretreatment by captopril (C) reduced the diuretic and natriuretic effect of furosemide significantly probably due to a diminished (about 50%) proximal-tubular secretion of furosemide. Captopril did not alter significantly the furosemide induced changes in urinary kallikrein and kinin excretion. After captopril there was a clear dissociation between aldosterone, which was diminished by captopril continuously, and renal kallikrein and kinins, which were still stimulated by furosemide. These results suggest that renal kallikrein-kinin system is stimulated by furosemide directly and independently of aldosterone secretion. Other ACE-inhibitors like ramipril (5 mg) or enalapril (20 mg) did not influence the stimulatory effects of furosemide on diuresis or kallikrein-kinin excretion. Ramipril at a dose of 10 mg, however, enhanced the initial diuretic effect of furosemide by increased furosemide secretion and increased relative sodium excretion. Hydrochlorothiazide induced a prolonged diuresis which was not changed by either captopril or ramipril. Urinary kallikrein excretion was not stimulated by hydrochlorothiazide. Our results show an important drug interference between captopril and furosemide, which is independent of ACE-inhibition and probably only due to an interference in proximal-tubular secretion of both drugs. Between captopril and hydrochlorothiazide no such interaction could be observed.", 
    "390": "A sensitive and specific gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (I, CS-622) and its active desethyl metabolite (II, RS-5139) in plasma and urine was developed. Compound D5-RS-5139 was used as an internal standard and measurements were made by electron-capture negative ion chemical ionization. Extraction from plasma and urine was carried out using Sep-Pak C18 and silica cartridges. The extract of plasma or urine was treated with diazomethane followed by trifluoroacetic anhydride to convert I and II into their methyl ester trifluoroacetyl derivatives. The detection limit of I and II was 0.5 ng/ml in plasma and 5 ng/ml in urine. The proposed method was satisfactory for the determination of I and II in plasma and urine with respect to accuracy and precision. Thus it is suitable for measurement of bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of I and II in body fluids.",

Baseline and C-stimulated plasma renin concentrations (PRC) were measured in 113 hypertensives, who where referred for the exclusion of secondary hypertension. In addition intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and a renal scintigraphy were performed. When renal artery disease was revealed by DSA or renin was stimulated the renal arteries were visualized by direct arteriography (and treated by angioplasty if possible). 86 patients underwent each diagnostic test: 21% had renovascular hypertension. Unilateral renal artery stenosis (n = 10) was detected by the captopril test (cutoff values: baseline greater than 40 microU/ml, after C greater than 180 microU/ml, sensitivity 100%). Bilateral renal artery stenosis (n = 8) was missed when the disease was equally severe on either side (sensitivity 50%). The specificity of C testing was 82%, overall sensitivity (uni- and bilateral disease 78%, prevalence 21%, predictive value of the positive test 0.56, predictive value of the negative test 0.93). With i.v.-DSA the renal arteries were technically evaluable in 91% (82/92) of cases. The sensitivity for the detection of all renal artery stenoses was 79% (uni-lateral 100%, bilateral 40%, specificity 97%). The sensitivity of renal scintigraphy for the detection of unilateral renal artery stenoses was 50%, for the detection of bilateral renal artery stenoses 43%, specificity 81%. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of captopril for the detection of unilateral renal artery stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "394": "In our studies we investigated the vasodepressor effects of bradykinin in vivo in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Bradykinin was injected intravenously and intraarterially (40-6050 pM/kg) respectively was infused intraarterially (40-6050 pM/kg/min). The investigations were performed in 21 normotensives and 15 hypertensives. Bradykinin injections were performed after the following pharmacological interventions: salt restriction (10 mmol Na/d), salt loading (300 mmol Na/d), captopril (50 mg), ramipril (5 mg), lisinopril (20 mg), ketotifen (2 x 1 mg), indomethacin (2 x 50 mg), and propranolol (80 mg). The results show that bradykinin lowers blood pressure dose related by marked reduction in peripheral vascular resistance. The blood pressure reduction was strongly correlated with the increase in kinin concentration. This effect of bradykinin appears to be independent of changes in sodium metabolism, of beta adrenoceptors, of histamine-1 receptors, and of prostaglandins. ACE-inhibitors potentiate the blood pressure lowering effect of bradykinin about 20- to 50-fold. In case of an intraarterial injection of bradykinin in only 2-5% o the intravenously used dose of bradykinin are needed to produce an identical fall in blood pressure. From this experiments a pulmonary clearance rate of bradykinin over 95% can be calculated. In the pulmonary arteries bradykinin has no effect on the vascular resistance. In patients suffering from primary or renovascular hypertension the blood pressure response to bradykinin was enhanced. The bradykinin potentiating effect of the ACE-inhibitors was not altered in the hypertensives. In patients suffering from bradykinin hypertension or primary hyperaldosteronism bradykinin developed the same blood pressure lowering effect as in the normotensives.",

A transpulmonary gradient greater than 15 mm Hg or a pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 5 Woods units increases mortality secondary to right heart failure. This study compares amrinone with conventional therapy in 38 transplant candidates with pulmonary hypertension. All patients had elevated transpulmonary gradient, pulmonary vascular resistance, or both. Group 1 (n = 21) received prolonged continuous intravenous amrinone therapy, whereas group 2 (n = 16) received high-dose oral diuretics, digitalis, and captopril. Both groups 1 and 2 had decreased pulmonary hypertension, transpulmonary gradient, and pulmonary vascular resistance. However, amrinone was more effective, with a 86% response rate versus 63% response for conventional therapy. Survival awaiting transplantation was significantly higher in group 1 (20 of 22, 91%) than in group 2 (10 of 16, 63%). Although both groups 1 and 2 had significantly decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, only group 2 had significantly decreased systemic vascular resistance. Comparison of pulmonary vascular resistance after therapy showed that the response in group 1 (amrinone) was significantly lower than the response in group 2 (conventional therapy), suggesting that amrinone may function as a direct vasodilator of the pulmonary vasculature. There were no operative deaths or episodes of perioperative right heart failure in either group. Amrinone appears to be more effective and safe than conventional therapy in the treatment of prospective heart transplant candidates with pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "396": "The response to the use of converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) either alone or associated to hydrochlorothiazide was evaluated during three months in 128 patients over 60 years old, with mild (79.7%) and moderate (20.3%) hypertension. Seventy (55%) were female and 58 (45%) male, being 64.8% white, 33.6% non-white and 1.6% asiatic. All patients received initially either a single dose of 25 mg of captopril or twice 12.5 mg, and after 1 month those in which hypertension was maintained 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was associated. During this period the analysis of the results showed a significant reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DP), however, there was a marked reduction during the first month. Thus, DP decreased from 101 +/- 8.8 (control) to 93 +/- 8.7 in the first month, to 89.6 +/- 8.2 in the second and 86 +/- 8.2 in the third, all significant at p less than 0.001. Similar distinction with previous treatment were observed when ranges on DP were analysed in patients receiving isolated or associated captopril. There was a small but significant weight and heart rate fall in patients receiving only captopril. Reduction of side effects was observed in 79% of the patients, as compared to previous treatment there being distinct improvement, while 21% showed no alterations and none showed complications. Therefore, we may conclude that use of captopril in elderly hypertensive patients was efficacious in the control of arterial blood without influence on quality of life.", 
    "397": "To assess acute hemodynamic effects and exercise capacity of an intravenously administered single dose of captopril and to compare the acute response with chronic variation in hemodynamic and functional parameters after long-term oral administration, (in order to determine the profile of responders and non-responders) we studied 12 patients with chronic congestive heart failure due to primary dilated cardiomyopathy (11 pts) and ischemic heart disease (1 pt). Hemodynamic response was assessed using transthoracic electric impedance with cardiac output measurement. The exercise capacity was determined using multistage bicycle ergometer symptoms limited stress test. The hemodynamic and functional evaluation--resting cardiac output, exercise capacity (Ex. Dur.) and cardiac output rise at maximum workload (% CO)--were investigated at first as a control; after i.v. captopril administered in 10 min (25 mg) (acute); after captopril per os (25-75 mg for 30 days) (chronic) and after 5 days of withdrawal (wash out). (Table: see text). Improvement of left ventricular performance mainly during exercise after acute and chronic administration of captopril occurred, as evidenced from cardiac output increase at maximum work load, and rise of exercise duration. Moreover, our data suggest that captopril may have a sustained beneficial effect, for a few days, even after drug withdrawal. Nevertheless, the lack of correlation in single cases between acute and chronic response, also indicates that captopril deserves further study to determine its role in acute and/or chronic management of congestive heart failure in order to choose the ideal strategy.", 
    "398": "Captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, has been shown to increase prostaglandin production by an as yet unknown mechanism, which this study was designed to explore. Isolated rat heart was perfused by the Langendorff technique for 15 minutes in the presence or absence of captopril. Ischemia was then induced for 60 minutes by terminating the coronary flow, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Our results indicate that captopril stimulated prostaglandin and thromboxane production, but it inhibited malonaldehyde formation. Coronary flow and high energy phosphate compounds were increased, but lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase release decreased, demonstrating cardioprotective effects. Captopril also inhibited the production of hydroxyl radical in the heart during reperfusion, suggesting that stimulated prostaglandin production may be linked with the generation of free radicals via the eicosanoid system.", 
    "399": "1. Captopril (30 or 100 micrograms/kg intravenous (i.v.] in anaesthetized artificially ventilated guinea-pigs potentiated bronchoconstrictor responses to bradykinin, but not those to histamine or the thromboxane A2-mimetic U46619. 2. Propranolol (5 mg/kg, i.v.) potentiated bradykinin-induced broncho-constriction. The potentiated responses were further augmented by captopril. 3. The captopril-potentiated responses to bradykinin were inhibited during cyclo-oxygenase inhibition with indomethacin. Bronchoconstrictor responses to bradykinin, but not those to histamine or U46619, were reduced after thromboxane synthase inhibition with dazoxiben. The thromboxane A2 antagonist AH23848 inhibited bronchoconstrictor responses to bradykinin, arachidonic acid or U46619 whereas it did not affect those to histamine. 4. A kininase I inhibitor DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethyl thiopropanoic acid caused no change in bronchoconstriction caused by bradykinin and did not alter the potentiated responses occurring after captopril. 5. Thus, confirmation has been obtained that bradykinin causes broncho-constriction in the guinea-pig indirectly, by release of eicosanoids. Thromboxane A2 is likely to be the major eicosanoid released, since the bronchoconstrictor effect of bradykinin was blocked by indomethacin, dazoxiben and AH23848. The intensity of the bronchoconstriction appears dependent on sympathetic influences mediated by beta-adrenoceptors. Kininase I, in contrast to kininase II apparently has little role in terminating the effects of bradykinin in the lung.", 
    "400": "Captopril (37.5 mg daily) was administered to 64 hypertensive patients for 16 weeks. During treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly (from means of 164/98 mmHg before treatment to 150/90 mmHg at four weeks and 142/86 mmHg at eight weeks; P less than 0.001), but serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein triglyceride, and apolipoproteins showed no significant changes. Scores on the atherogenic index did not change. Patients with high initial total cholesterol levels and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels tended to improve their lipid levels. It is concluded that captopril does not adversely affect serum lipoprotein metabolism.", 
    "401": "Capoten was used in the treatment of 28 patients with macrofocal myocardial infarction associated with marked acute cardiac insufficiency. 1.5 hours following intake of 6.25 mg of Capoten the arterial pressure reduced, the general peripheral vascular resistance, left ventricle filling pressure also reduced and this was accompanied by a reduction of rate of cardiac contractions, increase of cardiac ejection. No side effects related to Capoten treatment were observed.", 
    "402": "The effects of zofenopril (ZOF) calcium, an anticonverting enzyme inhibitor, and of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) on plasma lipids, lipoproteins and apoproteins were compared in 37 patients with sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 95 to 110 mm Hg at the end of a placebo period of 4 weeks. In the randomized double-blind experiment, 16 males and 21 females were treated with either ZOF, 30 mg (n = 18) or HCT, 25 mg (n = 19), once daily. When a SDBP of less than 90 mm Hg was not reached after 4 weeks, the dose of the initial treatment was doubled. Lipoprotein determinations were repeated after 12 weeks of active treatment. Statistically significant decrease in blood pressure (P less than .001) was demonstrated in both treated groups. Total, low density (LDL) and high density (HDL) lipoprotein, cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were not modified either by ZOF or HCT. Furthermore, LDL/HDL and HDL-2/HDL-3 ratios, apoproteins B, A and A-1 levels did not show any significant differences. Thus, ZOF and small doses of HCT do not cause deleterious effects in lipoprotein composition as reported in previous studies with higher dosage.", 
    "403": "The new renin inhibitor CGP 38560A has been shown to block angiotensin (ANG) production in healthy volunteers. In order to determine its potential antihypertensive effect, the compound was administered in a 30-min infusion, in 12 hypertensive patients (mean blood pressure (BP): 112.8 +/- 3.5 mm Hg). These patients were selected for their sensitivity to captopril: a single oral dose of 50 mg captopril lowered their mean BP by 8.8 +/- 2.2 mm Hg after 30 min and by 15.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg after 90 min. At the end of the renin inhibitor infusion, mean blood pressure decreased by 5.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg in the six patients infused with the dose of 0.125 mg/kg and by 6.0 +/- 1.8 mm Hg in the six patients infused with 0.250 mg/kg. The fall in blood pressure was correlated to the initial plasma renin activity (PRA) (r = 0.61, P less than .05). A dose-dependent effect was observed on plasma ANG I which fell by 74% with 0.125 mg/kg and by 94% with 0.250 mg/kg. Identical falls were found for plasma ANG II (72% and 94%, respectively) and ANG I and ANG II were well correlated (r = 0.91, P less than .001). The fall in BP was correlated to the fall in plasma ANG I (r = 0.77, P less than .01). The time-course of the BP changes was parallel to the changes in plasma angiotensins, as were the slightly delayed rise and fall in active renin measured by a direct immunoradiometric assay. When measured by the conventional ANG I radioimmunoassay, PRA values indicated a long-lasting inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "404": "Endopeptidase (EP) 24.15 cleaves the Tyr5-Gly6 bond of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2), and is the primary LHRH degrading enzyme in pituitary and hypothalamic membrane preparations. Potent and specific inhibitors were used to identify the enzymes involved in the in vivo degradation of LHRH. After i.c.v. administration of LHRH, only about 1% of the peptide was recovered from brain after 1 hr. Concurrent administration of LHRH and N-[1-(RS)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate (cFP-AAF-pAB), a specific inhibitor of EP 24.15, led to a more than 10-fold increase in LHRH recovery. Administration of N-[1-(RS)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Phe-pAB (cFP-F-pAB) or captopril, inhibitors of \"enkephalinase\" (EP 24.11) and angiotensin converting enzyme, respectively, did not significantly increase LHRH recovery. Intravenous administration of LHRH and either cFP-F-pAB or cFP-AAF-pAB but not captopril, led to an increase in the half-life of LHRH from 10 min to 15 and 20 min, respectively. Concurrent administration of both inhibitors resulted in a dramatic 8-fold increase in the half-life of LHRH, similar to values reported for \"superactive\" analogs of LHRH which are rendered resistant to enzymatic degradation by introduction of a D-amino acid in position 6. Concentrations of plasma LHRH 65 to 80 min after administration of inhibitors were 100- to 200-fold higher than those in controls. The potentiating effect of cFP-F-pAB resulted from inhibition of the in vivo degradation of cFP-AAF-pAB by EP 24.11.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "405": "In the myocardium, myosin and creatine kinase isoforms possess different capacities for using O2 and energy-rich phosphates. We studied electrophoretically the distribution of these isoforms in 19 hypertensive rats (two-kidney, one clip model of hypertension) and in age-matched controls. After 6 weeks of hypertension, seven rats were treated with captopril (2 mg/kg daily) for 4 weeks, six were left hypertensive for another 4 weeks, and the remaining rats were killed under ether anesthesia. In the latter, ventricular mass was significantly higher than in controls; V3 isomyosin was 32.3 +/- 6.8% versus 0%, and both creatine kinase-MB and -BB were increased at the expense of creatine kinase-MM (creatine kinase-MB = 29 +/- 2.8% vs. 14.7 +/- 1.8%, p less than 0.001; creatine kinase-BB = 3.1 +/- 0.6% vs. 1.7 +/- 0.8%, p less than 0.001). After 10 weeks of hypertension, ventricular mass, V3 isomyosin, and both creatine kinase-MB and -BB isoforms were found to be persistently higher than in controls. At the same time, captopril-treated rats showed reduced but not normalized blood pressure levels, normalized ventricular mass, and prevalence of the V1 isomyosin (56.9 +/- 22% vs. 47.9 +/- 23.8% in normotensive controls, p = NS). However, higher levels of creatine kinase-MB and -BB were still found in these rats in comparison with the normotensive controls (creatine kinase-MB = 22.4 +/- 5.4% vs. 15.8 +/- 2.8%, p less than 0.025; creatine kinase-BB = 2.3 +/- 0.1% vs. 1.8 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "406": "Pro-His-Pro-Phe-His-Statine-Ile-Phe-NH2 (R-Pep-27), a potent renin inhibitory peptide, was infused into the conscious, sodium-depleted Macaca fascicularis at doses of 0, 0.1, 1, 4, 16, and 32 micrograms/kg/min for 10 minutes. At all doses greater than 0.1 microgram/kg/min, there was a parallel decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma renin activity, and plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration. On the other hand, assays with monoclonal antibodies specific for total renin and active renin demonstrated that the peptide's inhibition of circulating active renin stimulated the release of both. The maximal effective R-Pep-27 dose was approximately 16 micrograms/kg/min, which reduced MAP by an average of 15.8 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (n = 14) and plasma renin activity and plasma Ang II concentration to 3% (n = 9) and 15% (n = 5), respectively, of the pretreatment values. At 0.1 microgram/kg/min, there was no significant decrease in MAP; however, measurement of plasma renin activity showed an average decrease in activity of 42% (n = 3). No significant change in the heart rate was observed at all the doses studied. For comparison, intravenous captopril (400 micrograms/kg bolus) was administered after the MAP of the monkeys had recovered from the peptide experiments, and it reduced MAP by 25.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg (n = 10) without significantly changing plasma renin activity. As anticipated, injection of angiotensin I (80-160 ng/kg bolus) into sodium-depleted monkeys during peptide infusion caused a transient rise in MAP of 14.8 +/- 5.4 mm Hg (n = 4) above the mean pretreatment value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
