    "1": "The patients were randomized to an intervention or control group. Medication reviews were made by one specialist in clinical pharmacology and one in cardiology. Symptoms related to heart failure or adverse reactions to cardiovascular drugs were recorded using a questionnaire. Quality of life and activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed and follow-ups performed after 2 weeks and 3 months. Outcome measures were changes of drug therapy and the global scores computed from symptoms scales.", 
    "2": "Eighty patients were randomized. They had a mean age of 87 years and their average number of drugs was 9.6. Changed drug therapy was suggested in 40 patients and the advice was followed by the responsible physicians in 19 patients. The physicians mostly followed advice for changed furosemide therapy but not for introducing an ACE-inhibitor, probably due to uncertain diagnosis and need for follow-up after initiation of such therapy. No significant changes from baseline to later follow-up were found in the mean total scores of any questionnaire.", 
    "3": "Intervention did not affect cardiovascular symptoms. Drug revisions should involve more than one class of drugs in order to be cost-effective.", 
    "4": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) upregulation in the stroma cells of arthritis rheumatoid joints may produce a higher tissue concentration of angiotensin II (angII), which is a vasoconstrictor and mitogen factor that causes local hypoxia and synovial proliferation. No study in the literature has examined the role of angII in joint blood flow (JBF) regulation and the potential effect of ACE inhibitors on JBF.", 
    "5": "The study was performed on 20 Dutch white rabbits to examine the JBF response to angII, angII receptor subtypes, and the role of nitric oxide (NO) in angII effects in knee joint blood vessels. Drugs were administered locally through retrograde saphenous artery cannulation. Joint vascular resistance (JVR) was calculated by dividing the arterial blood pressure by the JBF.", 
    "6": "AngII increased JVR dose dependently. The angII type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist losartan did not change the basal JVR but completely blocked the effect of angII on JVR. N(omega)-nitro-L-arginin methyl ester (L-NAME) increased JVR by a mean (+/-SEM) of 25.8 +/- 8.7% (p < 0.05) but did not affect the joint vessel response to angII and losartan.", 
    "7": "AngII receptors are from the AT(1) subtype in normal joint blood vessels, but angII plays no significant role in JBF regulation. The basal release of NO plays a role in resting JBF regulation, but NO does not affect the AT(1) receptor-mediated vasoconstriction of joint blood vessels.", 
    "8": "The syndrome of chest pain associated with characteristic anterior electrocardiographic changes, moderate increases in cardiac enzymes, and a reversible apical wall motion abnormality in the absence of coronary artery disease has been documented in Japan, but has received relatively little attention in other countries.", 
    "9": "The clinical and echocardiographic data of 12 patients (11 women, mean age 64 +/-14 years) who presented with chest symptoms, electrocardiographic (ECG) changes indicative of an acute anteroapical myocardial infarction, abnormal cardiac enzyme levels and echocardiography showing an apical wall motion abnormality were collected. Coronary angiography was performed in 10 patients. A follow-up echocardiogram was obtained within 2 weeks of the initial diagnosis in most cases.",

Respiratory distress was present in 7, the death of a relative in 3, in 4 a surgical or medical procedure had been performed, and in 1 a panic disorder was diagnosed. The echocardiograms showed a characteristic wall motion pattern of significant apical dysfunction. All of the patients who underwent coronary arteriography had noncritical coronary artery disease. Follow-up echocardiography showed normalization of the LV dysfunction in all instances.", 
    "11": "We identified a syndrome of chest pain, dyspnea, ECG and enzyme changes mimicking acute myocardial infarction, similar to the \"Takotsubo\" syndrome described in Japan. It is likely that the widespread use of echocardiography, coupled with increased recognition of this syndrome, will result in this diagnosis being made more commonly.", 
    "12": "This paper reports on the effect of captopril on the stability of unsaturated fatty acids in the evening primrose oil. The experiment was performed for captopril at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% in the samples of evening primrose oil at temperatures of 20 degrees, 40 degrees and 60 degrees C. The determination was performed on the 10th day of incubation. The results were compared to those obtained for analogous samples with octyl gallate, an antioxidant commonly used in oil systems, taken at the same concentrations and at the same temperatures. The changes in concentrations of the substances studied with time were monitored by gas chromatography. The results have shown captopril to be a stronger antioxidant than octyl gallate at all concentrations and temperatures used.", 
    "13": "In a clinical setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI), short-lasting and transient anginal pain, preceding the development of acute MI, is regarded as a symptom representing ischaemic preconditioning. Some experimental and clinical data suggested that preinfarction angina may favourably influence the course of acute MI.", 
    "14": "We sought to examine the hypothesis that preinfarction angina occurring within 24 hours prior to the onset of acute MI favourably influences the outcome.", 
    "15": "The study group consisted of 331 patients who were admitted to our hospital due to acute MI with ST segment elevation with a symptom duration <12 hours and received thrombolysis. Preinfarction angina within 24 hours prior to MI was present in 80 patients whereas the remaining 251 patients had no chest pain preceding acute MI. The course of the in-hospital phase of MI (mean 15 days) was analysed.", 
    "16": "In patients with preinfarction angina the in-hospital complication rate was significantly lower than in patients without angina preceding acute MI (p<0.001). Patients without preinfarction angina more frequently developed heart failure (p<0.001) or died (p<0.01) in hospital. Patients with preinfarction angina had significantly less extensive MI and had reperfusion symptoms more frequently. Multivariate analysis showed that there were three factors which independently favourably influenced survival: preinfarction angina (p=0.01), age < or =65 years (p=0.04) and duration of chest pain during acute MI < or =3h (p=0.03). Of the analysed group, 73 patients died in hospital. The independent variables predicting death included prior MI (p=0.04), history of diabetes (p=0.02), acute left bundle branch block (p=0.01) and age >65 years (p=0.03). Non-fatal re-infarction complicated the in-hospital course of MI in 27 patients.

    "17": "Patients with preinfarction angina, occurring within 24 hours of acute MI, have better in-hospital outcome and less extensive myocardial injury than patients without antecedent angina. These results may be attributed to the protective effects of ischaemic preconditioning.", 
    "18": "The present study evaluated the importance of ovarian functions and the renin-angiotensin system in the progression of the right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were bilaterally ovariectomized (Ovx) and injected with monocrotaline (MCT, 60 mg/kg, sc). Four weeks after MCT-treatment, only the male and Ovx female rats showed marked RV hypertrophy. The hypertrophied RV of the male-MCT and Ovx-MCT rats exhibited remarkably elevated renin mRNA levels. Gene expression levels of angiotensinogen, TGF-beta1, and endothelin-1 in the hypertrophied RV also increased, but to the less degree than did the renin mRNA. To investigate beneficial effects of estrogen or enalapril on progression of the pulmonary hypertension and RV hypertrophy, histological changes of the lung and heart were examined. Sham-MCT female rats showed histological changes indicating pulmonary hypertension without RV hypertrophy. In contrast, Ovx-MCT rats showed marked RV hypertrophy with pathological changes, denoting severe pulmonary and myocardial injuries. Estrogen-or enalapril-treated Ovx-MCT rats did not show RV hypertrophy, and showed remarkably ameliorated ultrastructural changes in the lung and RV. These results from this rat model suggest that both estrogen and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system have protective functions against the development of the pulmonary hypertension and cardiac remodeling.", 
    "19": "Experimental studies and retrospective analyses of mortality trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) have suggested that aspirin may reduce the beneficial effect of these drugs. The aim of this study was to assess a possible detrimental effect of aspirin on survival in stable patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction who had congestive heart failure and had been treated with ACE-Is.", 
    "20": "We performed a retrospective analysis in 755 consecutive stable patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. A Cox regression model was used to select independent predictors of survival and to test for a possible interaction between aspirin and ACE-Is with an adjustment to differences in clinical characteristics in subgroups of patients. Of the 755 patients, 328 (43.4%) had proven ischemic cardiomyopathy, 693 patients (91.8%) were receiving ACE-Is, and 317 patients were receiving aspirin (mean [+/- SD] dose, 183 +/- 65 mg/d; 74% of the patients receiving < or = 200 mg/d). During a median follow-up period of 1,996 days, there were 273 cardiac-related deaths, 14 urgent transplantations, 71 nonurgent transplantations, and 46 noncardiac-related deaths, and 3 patients were lost to follow-up. The cardiovascular mortality rates were 11.5% and 19.0%, respectively, at 1 and 2 years. There were no interactions among aspirin, ACE-Is, and survival in the overall population (p = 0.21), or in subgroups of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.41) or with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.74).",

    "22": "The management of essential hypertension has increasingly focused on the use of diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, which lower blood pressure (BP) through effects on blood volume and on the renin-angiotensin system. However, in many individuals these agents, whether given alone or in combination, fail to normalize BP. In such cases it is likely that hypertension is at least partly maintained by pathophysiologic mechanisms other than volume and the renin-angiotensin system, and therefore, that pharmacotherapy directed at other mechanisms is needed. One such form of hypertension is the often overlooked entity of neurogenic hypertension. The purpose of this article is to renew attention to this overlooked entity, to provide a very clinically oriented overview of its possible causes and manifestations, and to discuss the potentially important treatment implications of recognizing this form of hypertension. These implications underscore the need for further clinical and research attention concerning neurogenically mediated hypertension.", 
    "23": "Despite widespread use in hypertensive children, the safety and effectiveness of lisinopril had not been previously tested in a controlled study.", 
    "24": "This study explored the dose-response relationship and safety of lisinopril in 115 hypertensive children, aged 6 to 16 years. Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion for 2 weeks to one of three doses by body weight at baseline: <50 kg: low (0.625 mg), middle (2.5 mg), high (20 mg), and > or =50 kg: low (1.25 mg), middle (5 mg), high (40 mg). The dose-response for lisinopril was evaluated by analyzing the change in slope in sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure (BP) by dose after 2 weeks of therapy compared to baseline. Patients then entered a double-blind withdrawal, where patients were either switched to placebo or continued their current lisinopril treatment for up to 2 weeks. Patients completed period II when their BP returned to baseline. Antihypertensive effectiveness, between placebo and lisinopril was determined for all doses. Adverse events were carefully monitored.", 
    "25": "There was a dose-response relationship between the lowest and each of the higher doses of lisinopril. Blood pressure in the placebo group increased after withdrawal of lisinopril. The dose-response relationship was consistent across all subgroups (ie, age, Tanner stage, ethnicity, gender).", 
    "26": "Lisinopril, once daily, is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive in children aged 6 to 16 years. An initial dose of 0.07 mg/kg, administered once daily, effectively lowered BP within 2 weeks. Blood pressure was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion.", 
    "27": "The pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) is still unclear. A recent investigation indicated that angiotensin II, a potent activator of NADH/NADPH oxidase, plays an important role in aneurysmal formation. We investigated the potential role of p22phox-based NADH/NADPH oxidase in the pathogenesis of TAA.", 
    "28": "Human thoracic aneurysmal (n=40) and non-aneurysmal (control, n=39) aortic sections were examined, and the localization of p22phox, an essential component of the oxidase, and its expressional differences were investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. In situ reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was examined by the dihydroethidium method, and the impact of medical treatment on p22phox expression was investigated by multiple regression analysis.", 
    "29": "In situ production of ROS and the expression of p22phox increased markedly in TAA throughout the wall, and Western blot confirmed the enhanced expression of p22phox. The expression was more intense in the regions where monocytes/macrophages accumulated. In these inflammatory regions, numerous chymase-positive mast cells and angiotensin converting enzyme-positive macrophages were present. Their localization closely overlapped the in situ activity of matrix metalloproteinase and the expression of p22phox. Multiple regression analysis revealed that medical treatment with statin and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) suppressed p22phox expression in TAA.", 
    "30": "Our findings indicate the role of p22phox-based NADH/NADPH oxidase and the local renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of TAA. Statin and ARB might have inhibitory effects on the formation of aneurysms via the suppression of NADH/NADPH oxidase.", 
    "31": "The Maillard reaction involves the non enzymatic combination of carbohydrates such as glucose with protein aminogroups to yield schiff bases and Amadori protein adducts evolving into irreversible advanced glycation end products (AGEs). This phenomenon, part of normal ageing, is accelerated in diabetes, as a result of hyperglycaemia, and in renal failure, as a consequence of the accumulation of reactive carbonyl compounds (RCOs). AGEs and RCOs are implicated in uraemic toxicity both at the biochemical and the clinical level (dialysis amyloidosis, atherosclerosis, alterations of peritoneal membrane permeability). Reduction of plasma AGEs and RCOs is an interesting avenue to reduce uraemic toxicity. Therapeutic strategies involve dialysis technique (haemodialysis membranes, daily haemodialysis, ultrapure dialysate, RCO free peritoneal dialysate) as well as drugs inhibiting AGE formation (aminoguanidine and the less toxic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers).", 
    "32": "Prevention of cardiovascular diseases is essential in chronic haemodialysis patients. Recently, low-dose spironolactone has been shown to decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with severe heart failure. However, since haemodialysis patients are prone to hyperkalaemia, a known side effect of spironolactone, this treatment is not used in this population. We performed a study to assess whether low-dose spironolactone (3 x 25 mg/week) could be administered without inducing hyperkalaemia in haemodialysis patients.", 
    "33": "The study design included a 2-week baseline period, followed by a 4-week treatment period in which doses of spironolactone were started at 12.5 mg three times/week for 2 weeks, then increased to 25 mg three times/week, and followed by a 2-week wash-out period. Fourteen patients receiving low-dose spironolactone after each dialysis were compared with 21 haemodialysis patients (control group).", 
    "34": "Low-dose spironolactone did not change mean serum potassium (4.9 +/- 0.7 vs 4.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/l: control). The mean plasma canrenone level induced by administration of spironolactone 25 mg three times/week in the 14 treated patients was 13 +/- 5.3 ng/ml. Serum aldosterone was not significantly modified by the administration of spironolactone in these patients [before, median 0.35; interquartile range (IQR) 0.11-2.83 nmol/l vs after, median 0.22; IQR 0.12-0.60 nmol/l, NS]. Dietary potassium intake and the use of ion-exchange resin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers were similar for the two groups throughout the study.", 
    "35": "This non-randomized and non-blinded study shows that administration of 25 mg spironolactone thrice weekly is not associated with an increased frequency of hyperkalaemia in haemodialysis patients when they are carefully monitored. More studies are required, however, before concluding that spironolactone administration is safe in the chronic haemodialysis population.", 
    "36": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are capable of reducing proteinuria and microalbuminuria with preservation of renal function in diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease. We designed a study investigating the effect of enalapril on the protection of renal function in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).", 
    "37": "We studied 61 normotensive and 28 hypertensive ADPKD patients. The normotensive group participated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, using enalapril. The hypertensive group was randomized for open label treatment with enalapril or the beta-blocker atenolol. The follow-up was 3 years, and renal function was established repetitively by measuring the clearance of inulin.", 
    "38": "In the normotensive group, renal function at baseline was 112 +/- 3 ml/min and decreased by -8 +/- 2 ml/min (P < 0.001). The loss of renal function in the patients treated with enalapril or placebo was similar (-7 +/- 3 vs -9 +/- 1 ml/min; P = 0.4). Although blood pressure significantly decreased with enalapril treatment, it had no effect on microalbuminuria. In the hypertensive group, renal function at baseline was 89 +/- 2 ml/min. The mean decline in renal function was -12 +/- 2 ml/min (P < 0.001), and was equal in patients treated with enalapril and those treated with atenolol. The patients treated with atenolol required more additional treatment to control blood pressure, but no difference on microalbuminuria was observed between the two treatments.", 
    "39": "This study was unable to detect a beneficial effect of ACE inhibition on loss of renal function in ADPKD patients.", 
    "40": "The effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and volume expansion on renal function in the rat were studied to gain more knowledge of the oliguria seen during laparoscopic procedures and to reduce the detrimental renal effects of IAP.", 
    "41": "IAP was elevated to 5 or 10 mmHg by insufflation of CO(2) and maintained for 2 h in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated rats. Rats with normal IAP served as controls. An angiotensin II receptor I antagonist, candesartan, was given as a bolus injection and a 5% volume expansion was achieved by i.v. saline infusion. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was also given. Renal parameters were the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine production, the urinary concentrations of sodium and potassium and the osmolality in the urine. The arterial acid-base balance and blood pressure were also monitored.", 
    "42": "The GFR deteriorated by 70% during pneumoperitoneum (PP) of 10 mmHg. There was a dramatic drop in sodium excretion (88-97%). With candesartan and elevated IAP, there was a drop in mean arterial pressure (from 90 to 55 mmHg) and the negative renal effects were very pronounced. Renal function was better preserved during elevated IAP in combination with volume expansion.", 
    "43": "Capnoperitoneum suppresses renal function, especially in combination with angiotensin II receptor 1 blockade and ACE inhibition. Volume expansion reduces the deleterious effects of PP on renal function during elevated IAP. The results suggest that patients should not be given pharmaceuticals blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system prior to procedures that may increase IAP. It may be beneficial, however, to reduce angiotensin II tension by volume expansion.", 
    "44": "Heparin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can be used as a therapeutic option in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Although the mode of action is poorly understood, both agents may retard the progression of DN. Previously, we demonstrated that angiotensin II (Ang II) has an inhibitory effect on the production of heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) in mesangial cells (MCs). We have now studied the influence of heparin on the Ang II-induced intracellular Ca(2+) release and activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB).", 
    "45": "Human MCs were isolated from renal cortex and cultivated to measure Ca(2+) influx and NF-kappaB activation.", 
    "46": "Stimulation of MCs with 100 nM Ang II resulted in a rapid increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), followed by a decline to baseline level. The addition of heparin resulted in an oscillatory pattern of Ca(2+) influxes upon Ang II stimulation. Whereas the rapid increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was most likely due to release from intracellular stores, oscillations in [Ca(2+)](i) were dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca(2+). Heparin alone did not induce Ca(2+) influx. Both the initial increase and the subsequent oscillations in [Ca(2+)](i) could be blocked by losartan. In MCs with chemically or enzymatically altered membrane-associated heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG), Ang II stimulation resulted in [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. Interestingly, in these cells, the addition of heparin or GAG completely prevented [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. Heparin inhibited NF-kappaB activation in Ang II-stimulated MCs that expressed either normal or chemically altered GAG.", 
    "47": "These findings suggest that alterations in HS-GAG chemistry or metabolism under pathological conditions, such as DN, may have direct functional consequences for the local effect of Ang II.", 
    "48": "Since neither angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) nor angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) can completely suppress aldosterone levels, there is a need for alternative/supplementary antihypertensive medications, such as the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone (Inspra). This multicenter study measured the safety and efficacy of add-on eplerenone therapy to reduce blood pressure not controlled by ACE-I or ARB monotherapy. An ad hoc analysis evaluated whether active plasma renin or serum aldosterone levels could predict blood pressure response to eplerenone therapy. Patients (N = 341) with a diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg on a fixed dose of ACE-I or ARB were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with eplerenone 50 mg qd or placebo. If blood pressure remained uncontrolled following 2, 4, or 6 weeks of treatment, the eplerenone dose was increased to 100 mg qd. In a combined cohort analysis of these patients, the placebo-adjusted change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was -5.9/-2.4 mmHg (p< 0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively). While adding eplerenone to an ACE-I or ARB is safe and effective for blood pressure reduction, there was no baseline value or range of values of active plasma renin, serum aldosterone, or their ratio that predicted a favorable response to either of these drug combinations.", 
    "49": "All the components of the kallikrein-kinin system are located in the cardiac muscle, and its deficiency may lead to cardiac dysfunction. In recent years, numerous observations obtained from clinical and experimental models of diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure, ischemia, myocardial infarction, and left ventricular hypertrophy have suggested that the reduced activity of the local kallikrein-kinin system may be instrumental for the induction of cardiovascular-related diseases. The cardioprotective property of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is primarily mediated via the kinin-releasing pathway, which may cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive situations. The ability of kallikrein gene delivery to produce a wide spectrum of beneficial effects makes it an excellent candidate in treating hypertension and cardiovascular and renal diseases. In addition, stable kinin agonists may also be available in the future as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular and renal disorders.", 
    "50": "Obstructive uropathies caused by congenital malformations of the urinary tract are relatively frequent in newborn. These obstructive lesions are the main cause for renal disease in infancy. Most of these uropathies are treated by surgical interventions restoring the drainage function of the urinary tract. Clinically these patients are cured but the question remains wether these patients will develop renal disease in adult life, since it has been recently shown in animal models that transient, neonatal and prenatal, ureteral obstruction induces significant renal deterioration later in life. Except for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors that slow down the progression of renal disease, no specific drugs reducing renal fibrosis exist. Animal models of ureteral obstruction have allowed to clearly identify the events leading to tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, more recently, the use of ureteral obstruction in genetically engineered animals has shown pro- and anti-fibrotic properties of a large number of molecules. These studies using genetically engineered animals have suggested several new future promising therapeutic directions to treat renal fibrosis.", 
    "51": "Two new simple and selective assay methods have been presented for the binary mixtures of moexipril hydrochloride (MOEX) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in pharmaceutical formulations. The first method depends on second-derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry with zero-crossing measurements at 215 and 234 nm for MOEX and HCTZ, respectively. The assay was linear over the concentration ranges 1.0-11.0 microg ml(-1) for MOEX and 0.5-9.0 microg ml(-1) for HCTZ. The determination limits for MOEX and HCTZ were found to be 1.0 and 0.5 microg ml(-1), respectively; while the detection limits were 0.2 microg ml(-1) for MOEX and 0.1 microg ml(-1) for HCTZ. The second method was based on isocratic reversed-phase liquid chromatography by using a mobile phase acetonitrile-20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) (50:50, v/v). Lisinopril was used as an internal standard (IS) and the substances were detected at 212 nm. The linearity range for both drugs was 0.5-12.0 microg ml(-1). The determination and detection limits were found to be 0.100 and 0.010 microg ml(-1) for MOEX and 0.025 and 0.005 microg ml(-1) for HCTZ, respectively. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the determination of these drugs in synthetic mixtures and commercially available tablets with a high percentage recovery, good accuracy and precision.", 
    "52": "At the end of the 19th century, there was both experimental and clinical evidence that coronary artery obstruction causes ventricular fibrillation and sudden death and that fibrillation could be terminated by electric shocks. The dominant figure at that time was McWilliam, who in 1923 complained that \"little attention was given to the new view for many years.\" This remained so for many decades. It was not until the 1960s that the medical profession became aware of the magnitude of the problem of sudden death and began to install coronary care units where arrhythmias could be monitored and prompt defibrillation could be delivered. This approach was pioneered by Julian in 1961. Milestones that allowed this development were open-chest defibrillation by Beck, closed-chest defibrillation by Zoll, cardiac massage by Kouwenhoven et al., and development of the DC defibrillator by Lown. In 1980, Mirowski et al. implanted the first implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in a patient. Thereafter, the use of the ICD increased exponentially. Several randomized trials, largely in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction or in patients with documented lethal arrhythmias, showed beyond doubt that the ICD is superior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in preventing sudden death, although a number of trials showed no effect. Trials on antiarrhythmic drugs were disappointing. Sodium channel blockers and \"pure\" potassium channel blockers actually increase mortality, calcium channel blockers have no effect, and, although amiodarone reduces arrhythmic death, it had no effect on total mortality in the 2 largest trials. Only the beta-blockers have been proven to reduce the incidence of sudden death, but their effect appears not to be related to the suppression of arrhythmias but rather to the reduction in sinus rate. Drugs that prevent ischemic events, or lessen their impact, such as anticoagulants, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosteron antagonists, all reduce the incidence of sudden death.", 
    "53": "Although most studies have focused on the hepatocytes, all the hepatic cells participate in the regenerative process, among them the stellate cells. The stellate cells are mesenchymal cells involved in local neurotransmission and paracrine regulation of several liver functions. Acute hepatic tissue loss promotes the proliferation and activation of stellate cells from a quiescent state to myofibroblast-like cells.", 
    "54": "Investigate the effects of antihypertensive agents on the stellate cell population during the liver regenerative phenomenon in rats.", 
    "55": "Adult male Wistar rats received lisinopril, losartan, bradykinin, or saline solution in a proportional volume, intraperitoneally, before and after 70% partial hepatectomy. Animals from the experimental and saline groups were sacrificed at 36 hours after partial hepatectomy. The alpha-smooth muscle actin labelled stellate cells population was counted in the periportal and pericentral zones of the liver specimen.", 
    "56": "The labelled stellate cells were more numerous in the control group both in the periportal and pericentral zones at 36 hours after partial hepatectomy than at the other times. The population of stellate cells was significantly lower in the losartan group and higher in the bradykinin and lisinopril groups than in the control group.", 
    "57": "These results suggest that losartan can inhibit and bradykinin and lisinopril can stimulate the stellate cell population during liver regeneration in rats. These cells synthesize several substances to stimulate liver regeneration.", 
    "58": "Angiotensin II regulates many aspects of renal function and thereby influences long-term blood pressure. The effects of angiotensin II on the kidney have been exhaustively studied; however, the converse (i.e., effects of the kidney on angiotensin II) has received little attention. Accordingly, the focus of this study was to determine whether renal degradation of angiotensin II is regulated by chronic levels of angiotensin II or long-term levels of blood pressure. Twenty hypertensive rats and 22 normotensive rats were treated for 1 week with either vehicle, angiotensin II (50 ng/kg/min, subcutaneously) or captopril (100 mg/kg/day, orally). Right kidney vascular resistance was measured during infusions of angiotensin II into the left renal artery or vena cava at the level of left renal vein. Dose-response data were curve-fitted, and the extraction of angiotensin II by the left kidney was calculated by comparing the doses of angiotensin II required to elicit equal increases in right renal vascular resistance during intravenous versus left intrarenal artery infusions. Renal extraction of angiotensin II was high (mean, 81%) and demonstrated little animal-to-animal variation (coefficient of variation, 23%; standard deviation, 19%). Renal extraction of angiotensin II was independent of hypertension (P = 0.257) or previous chronic exposure to angiotensin II or captopril (P = 0.270), and there was no interaction between hypertension and chronic exposure to angiotensin II or captopril (P = 0.950). We conclude that renal degradation of angiotensin II is constitutively high, is unaffected by chronic levels of arterial blood pressure, and is independent of long-term changes in levels of angiotensin II.",

Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were done to examine the expressions of heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), HNE (4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). The antioxidative agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan or the Ang converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was given orally for 24 weeks to vasectomized rats. Spermatogenesis was evaluated by testicular weight and the percent of haploid cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.", 
    "61": "Vasectomy significantly increased interstitial fibrosis (more than 8 weeks) and induced the expression of HSP47, HNE modified protein and TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 and HSP47 immunoreactivity was localized to Leydig cells and fibroblasts. NAC or losartan but not enalapril inhibited the expression of these molecules induced by vasectomy. Increased interstitial fibrosis and impaired spermatogenesis were partially abrogated by NAC or losartan administration.",

We also examined the effects of their inhibitors on cell proliferation in a bladder cancer cell line. The expression of 5 and 12-lipoxygenase protein was detected by immunohistochemistry. The effects of lipoxygenase inhibitors on bladder cancer cell growth were examined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, while Hoechst (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri) staining was used to determine whether lipoxygenase inhibitors induce apoptosis.",

The BC and MLRC calibration algorithms are described for the two-component system, HCT-CTP. Some alternative methods, classical least squares (CLS), inverse least squares (ILS), principal component regression (PCR) and principal least squares (PLS) methods, were also used to determine HCT and CTP in the mixture. Using a synthetic mixture of the two drugs, all the methods were validated and applied to tablets. The BC and MLRC methods which are very rapid, and easy to apply, yet not expensive, are powerful tools with very simple mathematical contents for the quantitative analysis.

Chest radiography and computed tomography showed diffuse reticular shadows and ground-grass opacities in both lung fields. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis showed an increase of lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells (93.3% of lymphocytes), and a decrease of the CD4/8 ratio of the T cell subset (0.04). Histopathological analysis of trans-bronchial lung biopsy specimens showed infiltration of lymphocytes into the alveolar septa and exudation of alveolar macrophages, signs characteristic of interstitial pneumonia. A drug lymphocyte stimulation test was positive for temocapril, but negative for other drugs. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed temocapril hydrochloride-induced interstitial pneumonia.",

Well-recognized drawbacks of the procedure include reduced accuracy in patients with bilateral disease or renal impairment as well as the possible interference from concurrent antihypertensive medication (diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers). Currently, no data exist regarding the reliability of captopril renography in patients with renovascular hypertension evaluated while they are under chronic treatment with angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists (Sartans). Moreover, the renographic response of the kidney with renal artery stenosis to prolonged therapy with angiotensin II receptor antagonists has not yet been evaluated.",

The renographic evaluation was first performed after ingestion of the daily therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonist alone (Sartan renography) and was repeated within 7 d after the acute addition of 25 mg of captopril to chronic treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonist (captopril-Sartan renography). A cohort of 13 patients with a final diagnosis of essential hypertension was chosen as the control subjects.", 
    "71": "Twelve of 13 patients were correctly detected by captopril-Sartan renography (92% sensitivity), and 3 subjects were also identified without the addition of captopril. Adding captopril to Sartan therapy resulted in a slight reduction in mean arterial blood pressure, while significant side effects were never observed. No false-positive results were found in the 13 patients with essential hypertension.",

The aim of this study is to test the validity of the Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ), a new self-report tool for screening adherence and barriers to adherence. The tool includes a 5-item Regimen Screen that asks patients how they took each medication in the past week, a 2-item Belief Screen that asks about drug effects and bothersome features, and a 2-item Recall Screen about potential difficulties remembering. Validity was assessed in 20 patients using the Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS). Results varied by type of non-adherence, with the Regimen and Belief Screens having 80-100% sensitivity for \"repeat\" non-adherence and the Recall Screen having 90% sensitivity for \"sporadic\" non-adherence. The BMQ appears more sensitive than existing tools and may be useful in identifying and diagnosing adherence problems.",

This study examined the relationship between ACEI use at discharge and readmission among patients with heart failure due to LVSD.", 
    "75": "Data were abstracted from the medical records of 2943 randomly selected patients hospitalized for heart failure in 50 hospitals. The outcome of interest was the number of readmissions occurring up to 21 months after discharge. Six-hundred and eleven patients were eligible for analysis. Compared with patients discharged at a recommended ACEI dose, patients not prescribed an ACEI at discharge had an adjusted rate ratio of readmission (RR) of 1.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-2.48], while patients prescribed an ACEI at less than a recommended dose had an RR of 1.24 (95% CI 0.91-1.69) (P = 0.005 for the trend).",

A number of peptidases have been identified to possess kininase activity, the inhibition of which increases the availability and effectiveness of kinins. We wished to determine the cardioprotective actions of an aminopeptidase P inhibitor, apstatin alone and in combination with enalapril/lisinopril/ramipril in an in vivo rat model of acute ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (4 h). Myocardial infarction was produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Infarct size was measured by using the staining agent 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC). Lipid peroxide levels in serum and in heart tissue were estimated spectrophotometrically. A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored at various intervals throughout the experiment. Infarct size was reduced to a greater extent with apstatin and with combined inhibition it was further reduced. Infarct size reduction obtained with the combined inhibition came to normal with the prior administration of B2 bradykinin antagonist HOE140 suggests the involvement of bradykinin in the cardioprotective actions of apstatin.",

    "83": "Lacidipine (Caldine, Lacimen, Lacipil, Midotens, Motens) is a once-daily, orally-administered, lipophilic dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with an intrinsically slow onset of activity, resulting in a lack of reflex tachycardia. It has a long duration of action and a high degree of vascular selectivity. In addition to calcium channel-modulated vasodilation, lacidipine displays antioxidant activity greater than that of other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. In randomised, well-controlled trials, lacidipine 2-6 mg orally once daily had antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of other long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, thiazide diuretics, atenolol (a beta-blocker) and enalapril (an ACE inhibitor). Lacidipine was effective in elderly patients (including those with isolated systolic hypertension), African Nigerian patients and patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes mellitus. During long-term treatment for 4 or 5 years in patients with isolated systolic hypertension or essential hypertension, the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality with lacidipine was similar to that with chlorthalidone or atenolol. The European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA), in which 2334 patients with hypertension were randomised to 4 years of therapy with lacidipine 4-6 mg/day or the beta-blocker atenolol 50-100 mg/day, demonstrated significantly lower atherosclerotic progression and plaque formation with lacidipine compared with atenolol in patients completing the full 4 years of the study. Between-group differences in favour of lacidipine for the primary efficacy variable (mean change in carotid artery intima-media thickness) did not reach statistical significance in the intent-to-treat population. The tolerability profile of lacidipine (headache, flushing, pedal oedema, dizziness and palpitations) is similar to that of other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, but with a lower incidence of peripheral oedema. Data from the ELSA study suggest that the incidence of serious adverse events during long-term lacidipine therapy is similar to that with atenolol.", 
    "84": "Lacidipine is an effective, well tolerated, once-daily, oral antihypertensive agent that can be used in a wide variety of patients. As with other members of its class, lacidipine has shown potentially beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects, although definitive data with respect to possible superiority over other drug classes are still required. Therefore, lacidipine is an attractive therapy for the long-term management of essential hypertension.", 
    "85": "A 54-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension was admitted to the hospital for an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Therapy with intravenous furosemide and oral losartan 100 mg twice/day was begun. Ten days later, the patient's blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels rose and peaked at 110 and 6.0 mg/dl, respectively. His serum potassium level increased to 5.7 mg/dl, urine output dropped to 400 ml over 24 hours, and mental status changes occurred. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed bilateral renal artery stenosis. After losartan was discontinued and hemodialysis was performed for 3 consecutive days, the patient's renal function returned to his baseline level. Reports in the medical literature reinforce the importance of recognizing that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. However, the literature is not as definitive about using of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in these patients. Our patient's experience suggests that ARBs should be used with caution in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Clinicians should be aware that renal failure might occur when using ARBs in these patients.", 
    "86": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are recognized primarily for their use in hypertension, in heart failure, and after myocardial infarction. New evidence, particularly with ACE inhibitors, has shown their ability to reduce acute coronary events associated with atherosclerosis in patients without a history of the aforementioned cardiac conditions. This is likely due to inhibitory effects on the renin-angiotensin system--a system that adversely influences fibrinolytic balance, vascular endothelial function, and vascular inflammation, all key components of atherosclerotic progression and adverse coronary outcomes. Results of various studies suggest favorable effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on markers of these components, including effects on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, endothelin-1, and nitric oxide by ACE inhibitors, and effects on vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and C-reactive protein by ARBs. Although early evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors may provide a greater beneficial effect on some of these markers compared with ARBs, and that certain ACE inhibitors may provide greater vascular benefits than others, further investigation is required to verify such findings. Overall, understanding the distinct coronary vascular benefits of these agents will emphasize the importance of using them, particularly ACE inhibitors, to improve outcomes in patients with coronary atherosclerotic disease.",

    "88": "We hypothesized that reduction of venous return induced by a physiologic stimulus (tilting) or by acute angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in dilated heart is likely to have a marked and similar effect on ventricular chamber geometry and filling. This study was designed to assess how the normal and dilated heart adapts to preload reduction.", 
    "89": "Twenty normal subjects and 20 patients with moderate heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy were studied with two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in supine position (B) and after 40 degrees of head-up tilting (T). The following day, patients repeated supine (C) and tilting test (TC) after administration of captopril (25 mg s.l.). Right ventricular (RV) and LV dimensions, LV geometry, and tricuspid, mitral, and pulmonary venous flow patterns were recorded at each step of the study.", 
    "90": "In the two groups, T was associated with reduction of RV area and LV volumes; C and TC produced a similar effect on RV and LV. Changes in LV septal-lateral diameter and anterior-posterior diameter were different at each step of the study: during T (both groups) and after C and TC, the septallateral diameter increased slightly while the anterior-posterior diameter decreased. During T, mitral and tricuspid peak flow velocities decreased, peak late velocities were unchanged, and the deceleration time of mitral flow increased; the systolic forward flow of pulmonary venous flow decreased, the diastolic forward flow did not change, and the difference in duration between reverse pulmonary flow and mitral peak late flow decreased: C and CT induced similar changes.", 
    "91": "Preload reduction induced by tilting or by ACE inhibitors induces profound and similar effects on LV and RV dimensions, LV geometry, and biventricular filling. Reduction of RV dimension is associated with adaptation of LV geometry and decrease of LV diastolic pressure, which facilitates LV filling and pulmonary venous drainage: ACE inhibition associated with tilting exerts an additional effect on these changes. These data confirm the role of ventricular interaction in modulating LV filling in heart failure.", 
    "92": "A modest diet-induced increase in serum cholesterol in rabbits increases the sensitivity of the sarcolemmal Na+/K+ pump to intracellular Na+, whereas a large increase in cholesterol levels decreases the sensitivity to Na+. To examine the mechanisms, we isolated cardiac myocytes from controls and from rabbits with diet-induced increases in serum cholesterol. The myocytes were voltage clamped with the use of patch pipettes that contained osmotically balanced solutions with Na+ in a concentration of 10 mM and K+ in concentrations ([K+]pip) ranging from 0 to 140 mM. There was no effect of dietary cholesterol on electrogenic Na+/K+ current (Ip) when pipette solutions were K+ free. A modest increase in serum cholesterol caused a [K+]pip-dependent increase in Ip, whereas a large increase caused a [K+]pip-dependent decrease in Ip. Modeling suggested that pump stimulation with a modest increase in serum cholesterol can be explained by a decrease in the microscopic association constant KK describing the backward reaction E1 + 2K+ --> E2(K+)2, whereas pump inhibition with a large increase in serum cholesterol can be explained by an increase in KK. Because hypercholesterolemia upregulates angiotensin II receptors and because angiotensin II regulates the Na+/K+ pump in cardiac myocytes in a [K+]pip-dependent manner, we blocked angiotensin synthesis or angiotensin II receptors in vivo in cholesterol-fed rabbits. This abolished cholesterol-induced pump inhibition. Because the epsilon-isoform of protein kinase C (epsilonPKC) mediates effects of angiotensin II on the pump, we included specific epsilonPKC-blocking peptide in patch pipette filling solutions. The peptide reversed cholesterol-induced pump inhibition.",

The present study investigated the antihypertensive mechanism of tribulus in 2K1C hypertensive rats by measurement of circulatory and local ACE activity in aorta, heart, kidney and lung. Four groups of rats were selected; control, sham, operated or hypertensive and tribulus treated hypertensive group. Hypertension was induced using silver clip on renal artery by surgery. Four weeks after surgery, a single daily dose of 10 mg/kg of lyophilized aqueous extract of tribulus fruit were given orally to 2K1C rats for four weeks. ACE activity was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly increased in 2K1C rats compared to control rats. The SBP of tribulus fed hypertensive rats was significantly decreased compared to hypertensive rats. The ACE activity in all tissues of 2K1C rats including: aorta, heart, kidney, lung as well as serum were significantly increased compared to normal rats. The ACE activity in all tissues of tribulus fed hypertensive rats was significantly lower than that of hypertensive rats, which was more pronounced in kidney. These results indicated that there is a negative correlation between consumption of tribulus and ACE activity in serum and different tissues in 2K1C rats.",

    "126": "Today, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients need effective medical care for an extended period of their lifetime. Therefore, different treatment modalities have to be tied sequentially into an effective therapeutic chain. First, preventive measures have to be reinforced and risk factors tightly controlled. Furthermore, antiplatelet agents have to be applied in every PAD patient to reduce the risk of cardiac and cerebral ischemic events, restenosis or reocclusion after revascularization, and possibly also progression of the PAD itself. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be entertained in high-risk groups such as PAD patients with diabetes. In the claudicant, exercise therapy should be strongly encouraged and vasoactive drugs considered for those who are not good candidates for either exercise training or revascularization. In patients with disabling claudication or critical limb ischemia, revascularization procedures are highly effective. Especially for high-grade stenoses or short arterial occlusions, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) should be the method of first choice followed by the best surgical procedure later on. To achieve good long-term efficacy, a close follow-up including objective tests of both the arterial lesion and hemodynamic status, surveillance of secondary preventive measures and risk factor control is mandatory.", 
    "127": "The kidney plays a critical role in regulating the level of arterial pressure and in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Important evidence has come from studies in which hypertension is generated by transplanting kidneys from genetically hypertensive rats into normotensive recipients, suggesting that the level of blood pressure is strongly influenced by the genetic background of the kidney. We hypothesized that pharmacotherapy could modify specific properties intrinsic to the kidney such that after transplantation, there would be persistent changes in the level of arterial pressure. We determined that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment (enalapril) in spontaneously hypertensive rats induced both a persistent 17% reduction of mean arterial pressure and a persistent change in the kidney. This persistent change in the circulation could be completely transferred to untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats by kidney transplantation; ie, mean arterial pressure in untreated spontaneously hypertensive rat recipients was persistently lowered after transplantation of a kidney from a previously treated spontaneously hypertensive rat donor. In addition, the persistent lowering of mean arterial pressure after enalapril treatment could be completely abolished by implanting an untreated kidney, thereby revealing the importance of the kidney-specific changes. Furthermore, after within-group transplantations, there were no changes in the level of arterial pressure; ie, a 16% difference in mean arterial pressure remained between the 2 groups. The findings revealed that drug-induced changes specific to the kidney determined the level of arterial pressure, thereby suggesting the kidney should be a key therapeutic target for pharmacotherapy.",

At week 8, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg and/or amlodipine 10 mg was added if diastolic blood pressure was >90 mm Hg. Change in left ventricular (LV) mass as assessed by MRI was the primary end point. Change in blood pressure, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones, albuminuria, and safety were also assessed. Eplerenone significantly reduced LV mass from baseline (-14.5+/-3.36 g; n=50) similarly to enalapril (-19.7+/-3.20 g; n=54; P=0.258), but eplerenone/enalapril (-27.2+/-3.39 g; n=49) was more effective than eplerenone alone (P=0.007). All treatments reduced systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from baseline (eplerenone, -23.8 and -11.9 mm Hg; enalapril, -24.7 and -13.4 mm Hg; and eplerenone/enalapril, -28.7 and -14.4 mm Hg, P=0.048, in systolic blood pressure compared with eplerenone alone).

During the last 12 week period, 40 animals were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (i) group I was the control group; (ii) group II received hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/day); (iii) group III received quinapril (30 mg/day); and (iv) group IV was treated with hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/day) plus quinapril (30 mg/day). 3. The treatments did not affect either the lipid profile or serum electrolytes and oxidative stress. However, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in isolated aortic rings was significantly improved with quinapril (group III) treatment (P < 0.001 vs other groups). In addition, therapy with quinapril promoted a significant reduction in atherosclerosis (intima area, intima/media ratio and perimeter of vessel with plaque; P < 0.05 vs other groups), as well as in cholesterol content of the aorta (P < 0.05 vs groups II and IV). 4.

    "132": "The specific binding of digitalis glycosides to Na,K-ATPase is used as a tool for Na,K-ATPase quantification with high accuracy and precision. In myocardial biopsies from patients with heart failure, total Na,K-ATPase concentration is decreased by around 40%; a correlation exists between a decrease in heart function and a decrease in Na,K-ATPase concentration. During digitalization, around 30% of remaining pumps are occupied by digoxin. Myocardial Na,K-ATPase is also influenced by other drugs used for the treatment of heart failure. Thus, potassium loss during diuretic therapy has been found to reduce myocardial Na,K-ATPase, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may stimulate Na,K pump activity. Furthermore, hyperaldosteronism induced by heart failure has been found to decrease Na,K-ATPase activity. Accordingly, treatment with the aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone, may also influence Na,K-ATPase activity. The importance of Na,K pump modulation with heart disease, inhibition in digitalization and other effects of medication should be considered in the context of sodium, potassium and calcium regulation. It is recommended that digoxin be administered to heart failure patients who, after institution of mortality-reducing therapy, still have heart failure symptoms, and that the therapy be continued if symptoms are revealed or reduced. Digitalis glycosides are the only safe inotropic drugs for oral use that improve hemodynamics in heart failure.An important aspect of myocardial Na,K pump affection in heart disease is its influence on extracellular potassium (K(e)) homeostasis. Two important aspects should be considered: potassium handling among myocytes, and effects of potassium entering the extracellular space of the heart via the bloodstream. It should be noted that both of these aspects of K(e) homeostasis are affected by regulatory aspects, eg, regulation of the Na,K pump by physiological and pathophysiological conditions, as well as by medical treatments. Digitalization has been shown to affect both parameters. Furthermore, in experimental animals, potassium loading and depletion are found to significantly affect K(e) handling. The effects of potassium depletion are of special interest because this condition often occurs in patients treated with diuretics. In human congenital long QT syndrome caused by mutations in genes coding for potassium channels, exercise and potassium depletion are well known for their potential to elicit arrhythmias and sudden death. There is a need for further evaluation of the dynamic aspects of potassium handling in the heart, as well as in the periphery. It is recommended that resting plasma potassium be maintained at around 4 mmol/L.",

In the case of the expanded process, still more numerous interventions are performed with general anesthesia. The objective of research is to compare intraoperative hemorrhage and the visibility of the operative field during normotension and hypotension anesthesia caused by nitroglycerin and captopril when performing endoscopic operations of accessory nasal sinuses. Fifty-two patients of physical health state 1-2 according to ASA were examined: for 32 the controlled hypotension (Group H) was applied, 20 patients underwent operations in normotension (Group N). All patients on the eve of the operation were premedicated with diazepam; Group H patients on the day of operation received 6.25 mg of captopril. Anesthesia was carried out with fentanyl and halothane steam in the 50:50% mixture of oxygen and laughing gas. In Group H arterial blood pressure was lowered by nitroglycerin infusion. The average arterial blood pressure was maintained in GroupH within the limits of 50-60 mmHg. Hypotension was coordinated with the rising of the head-bed of the operating table at 5 degrees. Hemorrhage was measured by collecting blood with the pump graded with the precision of 25 ml. The visibility of the operative field was evaluated subjectively every 15 minutes according to the scale of 5 points proposed by Fromm. In both groups the average arterial blood pressure values as well as the values of the frequency of heart contractions differed statistically significantly. In the hypotensive group, hemorrhage during operation was less, on the average, (208 ml) than in Group N (349.2 ml). The visibility of the operative field was by one point, on the average, better than in Group H. No anesthetic complications were observed during investigation. In summary, it is possible to state that the controlled arterial hypotension caused by captopril and nitroglycerin reduced significantly intraoperative hemorrhage and improved the visibility of the operative field in endoscopic rhinosurgery.",

The possible clinical parameters that may predict poor outcome were examined. Nineteen patients with a median duration of follow-up of 9.6 (2.5-11.4) years were identified. At one year after biopsy, eight patients achieved complete remission, two patients achieved partial remission and nine patients had no response. Of the 10 responders, four relapsed after a median duration of 53 (42-97) months. Nine out of 10 patients (six nonresponders and four responders who relapsed) who underwent a second biopsy showed transformation to a higher grade nephritis. The long-term outcome remained favourable in nine patients. Responders and patients who were given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were associated with favourable long-term outcome.

    "143": "The MALDI-MES provides a rapid, sensitive and reproducible alternative approach to existing analytical techniques for the detection of enzymatic activities that does not require a chromophore or radiolabeling. An improved method is presented, by which enzymes with defined substrate specificities can be detected with a MALDI mass spectrometer in complex protein fractions. In order to demonstrate the utility of the new method, in this study we describe the use of MALDI-MES to detect proteolytic activities in a protein extract from porcine renal tissue, which contained several thousand proteins as visualized by 2D electrophoresis. The analytical procedure is based on covalent immobilization of proteins to beads. By immobilizing proteins, autolytic and proteolytic degradation is prevented and the removal of those molecules from the protein fraction is achieved, which otherwise would interfere with the mass spectrometric detection of the enzymatic reaction products. The enzymatic activity is determined by incubating the immobilized proteins with a reaction-specific probe, followed by the analysis of the reaction mixture with the MALDI-MS after defined incubation times. The presence of the target enzyme is validated by locating a signal, which fits the molecular mass of the expected reaction product in the mass spectrum. To demonstrate how to detect proteolytic activities in this system, the reactions catalyzed by endopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, kallikrein, renin, and urotensin-converting enzyme were monitored. The experiments showed that the MALDI-MES method is sufficient according the quantification to investigate the effects of inhibitors. This is demonstrated using a specific renin inhibitor to inhibit an angiotensin-I generating enzyme activity in a renal protein extract.", 
    "144": "Adipocytes secrete a variety of factors, including angiotensinogen, the only known precursor to Angiotensin II (AngII). Recent studies suggest that adipocyte-derived angiotensinogen can contribute to circulating angiotensinogen concentrations and modulate blood pressure; however, an autocrine role for adipocyte-derived angiotensinogen and/or AngII has not been well defined. We sought to determine whether locally produced AngII influences the release of leptin from adipocytes and thus circulating leptin concentrations. In adipocytes from rats treated for 3 d with captopril demonstrating reductions in AngII release, leptin release and plasma leptin concentration were decreased. Incubation of adipocytes with AngII resulted in an increase in leptin mRNA expression and leptin release. To determine the effect of elevated systemic AngII on leptin, rats were infused with AngII (175 ng/kg.min) or saline for 1, 2, or 7 d. Plasma leptin concentration progressively declined with duration of AngII exposure. Basal and AngII-stimulated release of leptin from isolated adipocytes was initially (d 1) increased in AngII-infused rats; thereafter leptin release declined to levels less than control. To define mechanisms for declines in leptin in AngII-infused rats, we examined the effect of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine on catecholamine turnover and plasma leptin concentration in saline- and AngII (175 ng/kg.min)-infused rats. Infusion of AngII increased catecholamine turnover in adipose tissue. Moreover, sympathetic blockade eliminated differences in plasma leptin concentration between saline- and AngII-infused rats. These results indicate that locally produced AngII directly increases leptin release from adipocytes; however, with elevations in systemic AngII, sympathetic activation counterbalances effects from locally produced AngII.", 
    "145": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were developed as vasodilators, and their use in cardiovascular disease treatment remains largely based on that mechanism of action. More recently, with the evolution of second- and third-generation CCBs, pleiotropic effects have been observed, and at least some of CCBs' benefit is attributable to these mechanisms. Understanding these effects has contributed greatly to elucidating disease mechanisms and the rationale for CCB use. Furthermore, this knowledge might clarify why drugs are useful in some disease states, such as atherosclerosis, but not in others, such as heart failure. Although numerous drugs used in the treatment of vascular disease, including statins and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, have well-described pleiotropic effects universally accepted to contribute to their benefit, little attention has been paid to CCBs' potentially similar effects. Accumulating evidence that at least 1 CCB, amlodipine, has pharmacologic actions distinct from L-type calcium channel blockade prompted us to investigate the pleiotropic actions of amlodipine and CCBs in general. There are several areas of research; foci here are (1) the physicochemical properties of amlodipine and its interaction with cholesterol and oxidants; (2) the mechanism by which amlodipine regulates NO production and implications; and (3) amlodipine's role in controlling smooth muscle cell proliferation and matrix formation.",

Antibacterial activity was detected against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Xanthamonas campestris but not against Pseudomonas syringae nor against two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. Endopeptidase and aminopeptidase activity in venom was detected using the synthetic fluorogenic substrates N-t-BOC-Phe-Ser-Arg-AMC, Arg-AMC and Leu-Arg. The aminopeptidase activity towards Arg-AMC was sensitive to amastatin (70% inhibition), an aminopeptidase inhibitor.

This activity was sensitive to captopril, an ACE inhibitor (IC(50) 3.8 x 10(-8) M). Using an antiserum raised against recombinant Drosophila melanogaster ACE-like enzyme, (rAnce), Western blot analysis revealed an immunoreactive protein, with a molecular weight estimate of 74 kDa, in P. hypochondriaca venom.

This capability is illustrated using the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (S)-1-N-[1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-L-ala-L-pro, which has the trade name enalapril. Electropherograms indicate that the two isomeric forms of enalapril can be separated with baseline resolution at 15 degrees C using capillary buffers having pH values in the dissociation ranges of the enalapril carboxyl group, pK(cis) and pK(trans) of 2.6 and 3.1, and of the enalapril amine group, pK(cis) and pK(trans) of 5.9 and 5.6. Such baseline resolution indicates that the isomeric composition does not change during analysis, facilitating measurement of the isomer composition of a sample prior to its injection into the capillary. Thus the effect of pH, ionic strength, or an aprotic solvent on the isomeric composition of enalapril can be measured under uniform analytical conditions. The trans isomer composition changes from 68% in the cationic form, pH <2, to 50% in the isoelectric form, pH approximately 4.5, to 60% in the anionic form, pH >7. Addition of salt to the isoelectric form or addition of an aprotic solvent to any form prior to analysis increases the trans isomer composition.

Ten patients with biopsy-proven primary glomerulonephritis (eight IgA nephropathy patients, two membranous nephropathy patients), non-nephrotic proteinuria (protein, 0.5 to 3.5 g/day) received candesartan cilexetil (2 or 4 mg) for 8 weeks. After the 8 weeks, a combination of perindopril erbumine (1 or 2 mg) and candesartan cilexetil was administered to the patients. Perindopril was stopped after the 8-week administration of the two drugs. Candesartan alone reduced proteinuria by 13%. Combination of these two drugs induced a more remarkable reduction of proteinuria (48%; p < 0.05 vs other periods). The decrease in mean blood pressure by the combination therapy was significantly correlated with the decrease in proteinuria. The combination of drugs also reduced the amount of urinary type-IV collagen excretion. An additive effect of ACEI and ARB on proteinuria and urinary type-IV collagen excretion was recognized in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis.",

    "171": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a frequently prescribed group of highly effective drugs of which the most well-known side effect is gastrointestinal peptic ulcer. However, NSAIDs have additional renal, cardiovascular, hematological, dermatological, and neurological side effects. Although the spectrum of side effects is slightly different between the conventional NSAIDs and the recently developed cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors, their overall spectrum is quite similar. Aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about NSAIDs and their effects on patients with cardio- or cerebrovascular disorders. NSAIDs interact with many drugs which are used in patients with cardio- or cerebrovascular disorders: They attenuate the effects of diuretics, betablockers, ACE inhibitors and AT-2 blockers, thus leading to uncontrolled hypertension or aggravation of heart failure. They increase digoxin levels, potentiate the effect of oral anticoagulants and interact with platelet inhibitors, thus leading to a higher bleeding risk. There are indications that NSAIDs may induce hypertension in normotensives and that COX-2 inhibitors may lead to an increased rate of myocardial infarction and strokes. Based on these data it is recommended that NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cardio- or cerebrovascular disorders and alternative pharmaceutical, physical or surgical therapy should be applied. If NSAIDs are inevitable, their side effects should be well monitored; they should be prescribed with caution when given in combination with diuretics, betablockers, ACE inhibitors, AT-2 blockers, digitalis, oral anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors. COX- 2 inhibitors should be avoided in patients with known coronary or cerebrovascular disorders. In patients with uncontrolled hypertension or worsening of heart failure, unreported NSAID-use should be considered. Generally, there is a need to develop further analgetic drugs without the described side effects for patients with cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders.", 
    "172": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by homocysteine in isolated rat aorta. Isometric tension recordings were used to assess inhibitory effects of homocysteine and protective effects of captopril on endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings. Exposure of aortic rings to homocysteine (0.3 approximately 3 mmol/L) for 30 min induced a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation response to acetylcholine (ACh), but did not affect endothelium-independent relaxation response to sodium nitroprusside. Pre-incubation of aortic rings with captopril (3 approximately 30 micromol/L) for 15 min and co-incubation of aortic rings with homocysteine (1 mmol/L) for another 30 min attenuated the inhibition of homocysteine in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, superoxide dismutase (SOD, 200 U/mL), a scavenger of superoxide anions, reduced homocysteine-induced inhibition. L-Arginine (3 mmol/L), a precursor of nitric oxide (NO), also attenuated the impairment of vasorelaxation induced by homocysteine. However, in the combined presence of SOD and L-arginine, the inhibitory effect of homocysteine was reversed, which was very similar to the effect of 30 micromol/L captopril. These results suggest that captopril can prevent the inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by homocysteine in isolated rat aorta, which may be related to scavenging oxygen free radicals and enhancing NO production.",

    "180": "The changes in blood pressure induced by fosinopril and irbesartan alone were not different from those of placebo, whereas the combination significantly decreased blood pressure. Simultaneously, it increased plasma active renin and prorenin concentrations to a greater extent than did each single-site blocker.", 
    "181": "In low-renin conditions, combined renin-angiotensin system blockade enables the demonstration of a persistent renin-dependency of the blood pressure. Through its more efficient blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, demonstrated by the increase in renin and prorenin, combined renin-angiotensin system blockade is more effective than doubling the usual dose of an AT1 receptor antagonist. This may offer an alternative strategy for treating patients with a range of renin concentrations, and may potentially increase the cardio- and nephrotective benefits through a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "182": "Glucose uptake is increased in hypertension. Thus we investigated Na+-glucose cotransporter (SGLT2) activity and expression in proximal tubules from renovascular hypertensive rats. Sham-operated rats, aortic coarctation rats, and aortic coarctation rats treated with either ramipril (2.5 mg.kg-1.day-1 for 21 days) or losartan (10 mg.kg-1.day-1 for 21 days) were used. Na+-dependent glucose uptake was measured in brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV). Vmax in BBMV from hypertensive rats was greater compared with those from normotensive rats (3 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.1 nmol.mg protein-1.min-1) without a change in Km. Renal immunostaining was greater, and Western blot analysis and RT-PCR showed a higher expression of SGLT2 in hypertensive rats than in normotensive rats (1,029 +/- 71 vs. 5,003 +/- 292, 199 +/- 15 vs. 95 +/- 10, and 1.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.1 arbitrary units, respectively). In rats treated with either ramipril or losartan, Vmax decreased to 2.1 +/- 0.3 and 1.8 +/- 0.4 nmol.mg protein-1.min-1, respectively, as well as did the intensity of immunostaining and levels of protein and mRNA. We suggest that in renovascular hypertension, angiotensin II induced SGLT2 via the AT1 receptor, which was evidenced at both the functional and expression levels, probably contributing to increased absorption of Na+ and thereby to the development or maintenance of hypertension.", 
    "183": "Based on the controversy about the relevance of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)-derived prostanoids from the macula densa for the control of the renin system, this study aimed to determine the interrelation between Cox-2 and renin expression in the mouse kidney. In control mice renin mRNA was readily detectable whilst renocortical Cox-2 mRNA abundance was at the detection limit of the RNase protection assay and no specific signals for Cox-2 were obtained by in situ hybridization or Western blot analysis. Experimental maneuvers such as low-salt diet, treatment with loop diuretics or angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors clearly increased renin mRNA abundance up to sevenfold, but under none of these conditions renocortical Cox-2 mRNA levels were significantly changed. Moreover, the strong stimulation of renin expression by angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition was not changed by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen, which in turn clearly lowered tissue prostanoid content. Our data suggest a marked divergence of renin and Cox-2 expression in the kidney cortex of C57Bl/6 mice with no clear evidence for a role of Cox-2-derived prostanoids from the macula densa in the regulation of renin expression.", 
    "184": "This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of bovine, ovine, and caprine kappa-casein macropeptides (CMPs) and their tryptic hydrolysates. The results obtained indicate that bovine, ovine, and caprine CMPs exhibited moderate in vitro ACE-inhibitory activities that increased considerably after digestion under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Active peptides could also be produced from CMPs via proteolysis with trypsin, with tryptic hydrolysates exhibiting a more extensive ACE-inhibitory activity than intact CMPs during simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Two active fractions were chromatographically separated from the tryptic hydrolysate of the bovine CMP, but their complexity hampered the assignment of the ACE-inhibitory activity to specific peptide sequences. Evidence for the release of the strong ACE-inhibitory tripeptide IPP was found upon simulation of the gastrointestinal digestion of peptides released by trypsin from the CMP sequence.

In M2, these values were 10.9%, 39%, 39.7%, and 10.4%, respectively.

Routine creatine kinase-myocardial band sampling should be considered in all higher-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery procedures to identify the sizable cohort of patients with creatine kinase-myocardial band release > or =10 ULN; these patients may benefit from postoperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy. Newer cardioprotective agents that reduce the number of patients with marked creatine kinase-myocardial band release are currently being tested in large randomized controlled clinical trials.", 
    "193": "Type 2 diabetes is characterised by insulin resistance in association with clustering of atherothrombotic risk factors (dysglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hypertension, raised triglyceride, low HDL cholesterol and increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and clotting factor VII). There is a 3-5 fold increase in risk of myocardial infarction rising to 10-20 fold in the presence of microalbuminuria and overall around 70-75% of subjects with type 2 diabetes die of cardiovascular disease. However, classical risk factors which associate with insulin resistance do not account for all the increased burden of vascular disease in diabetic subjects. Metformin is a biguanide compound which is antihyperglycaemic, reduces insulin resistance and has cardioprotective effects on lipids, thrombosis and blood flow. Metformin has a weight neutral/weight lowering effect and reduces hypertriglyceridaemia, elevated levels of PAI-1, factor VII and C-reactive protein. In addition recent studies indicate that metformin has direct effects on fibrin structure/function and stabilises platelets, two important components of arterial thrombus. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) reported that metformin was associated with a 32% reduction in any diabetes related endpoint (p<0.002), a 39% reduction in myocardial infarction (p<0.01) and a non-significant 29% fall in microvascular complications. The figures for macrovascular complications compare favourably for those described for other cardioprotective agents such as ACE inhibitors and statins. These findings confirm metformin as first line therapy in the management of obese insulin resistant type 2 diabetes and in the prevention of the vascular complications of this common condition.",

This differential regulation of cardiac PKC isozymes was limited to the strained ventricle and was not altered in response to chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with ramiprilate. Furthermore, no significant changes in the expression of calcineurin alpha and beta subunits were observed in RV pressure overload compared to controls. PAB-induced cardiac apoptosis was determined using Western blot analysis by a significantly increased expression of Bax protein and caspase-3 in the hypertrophied RV, which was diminished to almost control levels by chronic ramiprilate treatment.

We measured glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in human endothelial cells treated with captopril or enalaprilat, two ACE inhibitors, and we showed that both inhibitors decreased GPX and SOD activities but not MDA, the end-product of lipoperoxidation. Captopril and enalaprilat were also unable to protect against etoposide-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells, indicating that they cannot be considered as protective drugs for the endothelium, in particular in clinical situations involving oxidative stress or apoptosis. Moreover, when used at high concentration captopril, but not enalaprilat, was toxic for endothelial cells with both necrotic and apoptotic effects.", 
    "198": "Elevated blood pressure is a risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular disorders, including coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cardiac failure and cerebrovascular disease. The prevailing view is that an elevated systolic rather than diastolic blood pressure is the major contributor in mortality and morbidity attributed to cardiovascular disorders. Isolated high systolic blood pressure, especially in the elderly, is a major risk factor and should undoubtedly be a target for drug treatment. In the general population, systolic and diastolic blood pressure are highly correlated, and thus it is difficult to dissociate the effects of these two components of the blood pressure and specifically ascribe cardiovascular risk factors to just elevated systolic blood pressure. Therefore, the goal in therapy of an individual with hypertension must be to reduce elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure in order to reduce mortality and morbidity. ACE and neutral peptidase inhibitors are a new class of drugs that may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with hypertension and heart failure. They may also be useful in the treatment of diabetic patients with hypertension and/or heart failure. Drugs of this class are dual inhibitors of ACE and neutral endopeptidase, and are capable of affecting vascular tone and fluid balance. They are capable of producing vasodilatation by virtue of inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, degradation of natriuretic peptides and bradykinin. They also appear to promote natriuresis and diuresis by amplifying the actions of natriuretic peptidase and reducing aldosterone effects. In addition, they should also attenuate trophogenic actions of the renin angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system. Omapatrilat is one drug that appears to be at the advanced stages of clinical development. This drug has been shown to be quite effective in the treatment of hypertension. Evidence also seems to indicate that treatment with omapatrilat results in a higher tendency towards preventing death and worsening heart failure when compared with treatment with a pure ACE inhibitor in patients with advanced heart failure. Overall safety with omapatrilat appears to be good, but like other ACE inhibitors the incidence of cough is higher when compared with placebo. Other common adverse effects noted are headaches, facial flushing/warm sensation, dizziness, nausea and dyspnoea. Of greater concern is the occurrence of angio-oedema, the true incidence of which remains to be fully established as part of the published medical literature.", 
    "199": "The roots of Salviae miltiorrhiza (RSM) have been traditionally used for treatment of hypertensive disease in China, Korea, and Japan. Bioassay guided fractionation and purification as assayed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory assay resulted in the isolation of lithospermic acid B (LSB) as an active principle. The ACE plasma activities were significantly inhibited by the addition of LSB in a dose-dependent manner of which IC50 value was 86 microg/ml (120 microM). Moreover, angiotensin I-induced contraction was markedly attenuated by prior exposure of endothelium-intact aortic rings to LSB. These results suggest that RSM-induced antihypertensive effect may be, at least in part, due to ACE inhibitory effect of LSB.",

    "216": "The total number of patients was 1860: 645 (35%) females and 1215 (65%) males. Mean duration of follow-up was 2.2 years. The proportions randomized to ACEI (51%), mean baseline serum creatinine (2.2 mg/dl) and mean age (52 years) were similar for both genders. Mean baseline SBP was greater in women than in men: 151 vs 147 mmHg (P < 0.001). Mean baseline UP was significantly lower in women compared with men: 1.3 vs 2.1 g/day (P < 0.001). A total of 311 (16.7%) patients developed the primary end point, and 176 (9.5%) developed the secondary end point. The unadjusted relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary end point in women vs men was 0.98 (0.77-1.24). It became 1.32 (1.03-1.69) after adjusting for the baseline variables and interaction between ACEIs and baseline UP, and 1.36 (1.06-1.75) after adjusting for baseline variables and changes in SBP and UP during follow-up. Similar results were found for the outcome of ESRD.", 
    "217": "Our findings suggest that the rate of renal disease progression may not be slower, and may even be faster in women compared with men, after adjusting for other factors associated with a faster rate of progression. We caution that most women in our database were of post-menopausal age, and thus our findings may not extend to younger women.", 
    "218": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a new class of compounds that inhibit both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase. This study determined whether treatment with the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (OMA) produced different effects on renal and cardiovascular structure compared with inhibition of ACE by enalapril (ENP) in rats with two-kidney, one clip hypertension (2K1C).", 
    "219": "Hypertensive 2K1C rats were randomized into four groups and studied for another 8 weeks: no treatment, OMA, ENP or ENP combined with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (ENP + HCTZ). Albuminuria, vascular and renal histology as well as glomerular expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) were determined at the end of the experiment.", 
    "220": "OMA decreased blood pressure slightly better than ENP. However, combination of ENP with a diuretic lowered blood pressure equally effective as OMA. OMA was numerically more efficient in reducing cardiovascular and renal hypertensive changes compared with ENP. In contrast, the combination of ENP + HCTZ was as efficient as OMA. However, OMA lowered overexpression of TGF-beta in the non-clipped kidney better than ENP or ENP +HCTZ. Antihypertensive therapy surprisingly decreased renal function as shown by increased plasma creatinine and urea and decreased creatinine clearance.", 
    "221": "OMA is marginally more potent compared with ENP alone in lowering blood pressure and preventing cardiovascular and renal injury. This effect may be due to slightly better blood pressure reduction because addition of HCTZ enhances the cardio- and nephroprotective capacity of ENP. In contrast, OMA reduces TGF-beta overexpression in the non-clipped kidney better than ENP or ENP + HCTZ. Therefore, vasopeptidase inhibition is not superior to ACE inhibition in the prevention of cardiovascular and renal damage Goldblatt hypertension.", 
    "222": "The pathomechanisms that cause renal damage in diabetes have not been completely clarified. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) is highly effective but fails to completely prevent end-stage renal disease. The effects of ET(A)-receptor blockers (ET(A)-RB) on renal damage are controversial and have rarely been investigated in type 2 diabetes. We compared the influence of the selective ET(A)-RB LU135252 and the ACE-i Trandolapril on renal structure in the SHR/N-cp rat model of type 2 diabetes. Three-month-old male SHR/N-cp rats were left untreated or received daily either Trandolapril or LU135252. The experiment was terminated after 6 months. The glomerulosclerosis index; tubulointerstitial damage index; and glomerular geometry, glomerular cell number, and capillary density were investigated. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen and desmin expression of podocytes, renal mRNA expression of endothelin (ET-1) and transforming growth factor-beta, blood pressure, and urine albumin excretion were measured. The glomerulosclerosis index was significantly higher in untreated diabetic animals than in the groups that were treated with ACE-i and ET(A)-RB. There were analogous changes in tubulointerstitial damage index. Treatment with either substance comparably lowered urinary albumin excretion in diabetic SHR/N-cp. Podocyte and endothelial cell numbers per glomerulus decreased in untreated diabetic animals; this was prevented by the ACE-i but not by the ET(A)-RB. Glomerular capillary length density was lower in SHR/N-cp, and this was normalized by ACE-i only. Increased expression of desmin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression of podocytes in the SHR/N-cp was abrogated by ACE-i but not by ET(A)-RB. Treatment with ACE-i or ET(A)-receptor antagonist resulted in less structural and functional alterations, but the ET(A)-RB was inferior to the ACE-i. This is particularly the case for podocyte changes pointing to angiotensin II-dependent pathomechanisms.",

Recent epidemiological studies suggest that stroke is becoming more common, perhaps due to the ageing of the population and increased survival of patients with cardiac disease. There are specific and well-defined risk factors in patients with stroke, the most important being hypertension. Treatment options to reverse the effect of acute ischaemic stroke are limited. The only approved therapy is intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The disadvantage of tPA treatment is a rate of symptomatic haemorrhage of about 6%. Newer stroke prevention options are currently being investigated including statins, oestrogen, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The challenge for physicians is to select the most effective intervention, and this depends on our knowledge of the underlying stroke mechanism and the patient's risk factors.",

    "242": "Although atherosclerosis is today seen as presenting a distinct clinical picture, there are almost no data available about the impact this has on medical practice and about the point at which a patient is considered high-risk. As part of a larger project on the prevention of heart disease and atherosclerosis, \"Aktion plus leben\", 1,117 physicians were polled in a scientific survey. The study was carried out in some 100 hospitals throughout Austria, above all in departments of internal medicine, but also in neurological departments, and in a number of other units. The results showed that in fact over 90% of those questioned see atherosclerosis as a separate, treatable illness in the context of risk prevention. The most frequent methods of diagnosis were specified as ultrasound and the clarification of symptoms of coronary heart disease. Atherosclerosis prevention is initiated above all in patients with coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and stroke, but also very frequently in those with diabetes, peripheral vascular occlusive disease, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Of particular interest to us was the respondents' evaluation of the effect of ramipril, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the HOPE study. The majority of those questioned see a broad range of indications for this ACE inhibitor and ascribe to it a profibrinolytic, antiinflammatory and plaque-stabilising action. Although the survey sought assessment of just one particular medication as a possible treatment option, the study documents the importance of a more inclusive concept of atherosclerosis prevention.",

At steady-state in young subjects, manidipine AUC and Cmax were lower (-8 and -12%) and t1/2 was longer (+45%), while delapril and metabolites were little affected as compared to single dose. In elderly subjects, manidipine Cmax was 4% lower than after single dose, AUC was 13% higher, and t1/2 was increased 2.4-fold. For delapril and active metabolites, Cmax and AUC increased modestly. Blood pressure and heart rate versus time profiles after single dose and at steady-state were almost superimposable. In elderly compared to young subjects at steady-state, peak concentrations of manidipine and delapril changed by +35% and -15% while AUCs increased by +70% and +9.7%.",

Low-dose diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have reduced cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Angiotensin receptor blockers with diabetic renal disease have reduced the rate of end-stage renal disease, whereas dihydropyridine calcium antagonists show no benefit. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers reduce overall mortality, cardiovascular events, and the development of the overt nephropathy in high-risk patients with diabetes without advanced renal disease. The blood pressure treatment goal for patients with diabetes without macroalbuminuria is less than 130/80 mm Hg and less than 125/75 mm Hg for patients with diabetes and nephrotic syndrome.

The mass balance of [(14)C]M100240 was assessed following oral administration of [(14)C]M100240. Healthy male subjects were given a single 25-mg dose of [(14)C]M100240 (50 microCi) as an oral solution under fasting conditions. Blood samples and excreta were collected postdose. (14)C-radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Plasma concentrations of M100240 and MDL 100,173 were determined by LC/MS/MS methods. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. About 98% of the total radioactive dose was recovered within 7 days of oral administration, with most of the radioactivity recovered within 72 hours. Of the recovered radioactive dose, 49.4% and 48.5% were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Unchanged M100240 and MDL 100,173 were not detected in the excreta. On average, 76% of the total radioactivity in the blood was associated with the plasma fraction. M100240 accounted for less than 0.06% of the (14)C-radioactivity in plasma and MDL 100,173 accounted for 15.8% (AUC( infinity )) of (14)C-radioactivity in plasma after oral dosing. These data suggest that the drug was absorbed but rapidly converted to its metabolites either presystemically or postsystemically. Up to 78% of the total radioactivity was identified as MDL 100,173. The apparent terminal elimination half-life of MDL 100,173 was longer than that of (14)C-radioactivity, attributable to assay sensitivity and the saturable binding phenomenon commonly associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. M100240 undergoes extensive metabolism in humans, and its metabolites are excreted relatively equally in feces and urine.", 
    "253": "In isolated cells (vascular smooth muscle, endothelium, platelets), perfused hearts, in vivo experiments, conscious instrumented animals, and in human subjects the induction of tachyphylaxis and tolerance to various exogenous NO-donors was analyzed. Various ways to circumvent tolerance were successfully tested. Different nitrovasodilators were associated with different rates and magnitudes of generation of tolerance and reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) in all models tested, beginning with PETN (pentaerithrityltetranitrate) (lowest rate) and concluding with GTN (highest rate). This pattern was found in all models tested (isolated cells, perfused organs, and in vivo experiments). The observed changes in ROS production in isolated cells were identical to changes in ROS production in vascular smooth muscle, endothelial cells, and platelets. Thus, blood cells such as washed platelets could be used as marker cells to identify induction of tolerance and rise in platelet activity, closely reflecting changes in the rate of tolerance generation to nitrates associated with enhanced oxidant stress (ROS generation). Generation of tachyphylaxis could be suppressed or even avoided by supplementation of appropriate antioxidants (SOD, vitamin C, DMSO, beta-blockers with antioxidant capacity, modulators of prostanoid metabolism such as ASS) in all models tested, including human subjects. Even fully developed tolerance (during non-intermittent GTN-administration) could be reversed by starting an appropriate antioxidant supplementation. This indicates that other potential factors involved in the generation of nitrovasodilator-associated tolerance (reducing the intended vasodilation and the concovactent decreases in blood pressure, namely augmented sympathetic and RAS-activity, changes in the activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase, protein kinase C, phosphodiesterase, etc.) are of minor importance. Thus, the treatment of tolerance under clinical conditions should closely target changes in redox potential and antioxidant capacity.",

CPL was adsorptively preconcentrated on the mercury surface as a sparingly soluble mercury salt under stirring of the solution and then the accumulated species was reduced by a cathodic square wave voltammetric scan. The reduction current was related to the CPL concentration in the sample. The chemical and instrumental parameters affecting the response were investigated and optimized for the CPL determination. The calibration curve was linear from 0.5 to 180 microg l(-1) of CPL (depending on the preconcentration time), the limit of detection at a S/N ratio of 3 was 0.5 microg l(-1) with 300 s of preconcentration and the relative standard deviation was 3.2% at the 20 microg l(-1) level (with 120 s of preconcentration, n=8).

All indices, except I kappa B, reverted toward baseline, 7 d after the cessation of the drug. I kappa B persisted in an elevated state. Neither quinapril nor simvastatin given for 7 d produced a suppression of ROS generation, intranuclear NF-kappa B, p65, or CRP, and these two agents did not alter cellular I kappa B either. The untreated controls also did not demonstrate a change in their ROS generation or NF-kappa B binding activity or plasma CRP concentration. We conclude that valsartan at a modest dose exerts a profound and rapid ROS and inflammation-suppressive effect that may be relevant to its potential beneficial effects in atherosclerosis, diabetes, and congestive cardiac failure. In contrast, quinapril and simvastatin produced no similar effect over the period of 1 wk. Our observations may also have implications to clinical situations in which a rapid antiinflammatory effect is required.",

Little is known regarding the use of secondary prevention in older patients undergoing CABG during hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).", 
    "268": "Medical records were reviewed for a sample of 37,513 patients hospitalized with AMI in the United States between April 1998 and March 1999. Patients >or=65 years of age who underwent CABG after AMI (n=2,267 [8%]) were evaluated for the prescription of 4 therapies at discharge: aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and lipid lowering, in eligible patients without contraindications to therapy and compared with patients who did not undergo CABG (n=26,484 [92%]). Patients undergoing CABG had higher rates of aspirin than patients who did not undergo CABG (88.0% versus 83.2%, P=0.0002). However, CABG patients were less likely to receive beta-blockers (61.5% versus 72.1%, P<0.0001), ACE inhibitors (55.5% versus 72.1%, P<0.0001), or lipid lowering (34.7% versus 55.7%, P<0.0001) prescriptions than patients who did not undergo CABG. After adjustment for disease severity, patients undergoing CABG were no longer more likely to receive discharge aspirin, and the magnitude of other differences in care increased.",

    "270": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) increases the resistance to gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary interface. Recent reports highlight the pathophysiologic relevance of changes in the lung leading to impaired fluid and gas exchange in the distal airway spaces. Under experimental conditions, an acute pressure or volume overload can injure the alveolar blood-gas barrier. This may disrupt its anatomic configuration, cause the loss of regulation of fluid-flux, and thereby affect alveolar gas conductance properties. These ultrastructural changes have been identified under the term of stress failure of the alveolar-capillary membrane. In the short term, these alterations are reversible due to the reparative properties of the alveolar surface. However, when the alveolar-capillary membrane is chronically challenged, for instance in patients with CHF, by noxious stimuli, such as humoral, cytotoxic, and genetic factors other than by mechanical trauma, remodeling of pathophysiologic and clinical importance may take place. These changes in some respects resemble the remodeling process in the heart. Emerging findings support the view that, in patients with CHF, alveolar-capillary membrane dysfunction may contribute to symptom exacerbation and exercise intolerance, and may be an independent prognosticator of clinical course. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ameliorate the alveolar membrane gas conductance abnormality, reflecting improvement in the remodeling process. This article reviews the putative mechanisms involved in the impairment in gas diffusion in CHF patients and provides a link between physiologic changes and clinical findings.",

In the single-dose study, Cmax (1-1009 ng ml(-1)) and AUC(0,t) (0.4-1891 ng ml(-1) h) were linear but not dose proportional. In the multiple-dose study, based on weighted least-squares linear regression analyses vs dose, Cmax but not AUC(0,t) was linear at the lower doses on day 10. The lowest dose of omapatrilat (2.5 mg) almost completely inhibited (> 97%) serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity at 2 h after dosing. In the multiple dose study, angiotensin converting enzyme activity was inhibited by more than 80% 24 h after all doses of omapatrilat. Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase activity was shown by increases in the daily urinary excretion of atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate at doses of more than 7.5 and 25 mg, respectively. In the single dose study, omapatrilat increased the daily urinary excretion of atrial natriuretic peptide dose-dependently from 10.8 +/- 4.1 (+/- SD) ng 24 h(-1) in the placebo group to 60.0 +/- 18.2 ng 24 h(-1) in the 500 mg group.

The impact of this disease on society and the health care system is immense. Inpatient and outpatient costs are approximately $40 billion annually, almost $500 million of which is spent on heart failure medications alone. Beyond the problem of financial costs, however, it is imperative for us as health care professionals to improve our ability to prevent disease progression, decrease morbidity and mortality, and optimize patients quality of life. The use of a broad spectrum of treatments is reviewed in the context of a patient case study. Primary data justifying the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, digoxin, as well as beta blockers and spironolactone, is reviewed, with special reference to the stage of heart failure.", 
    "284": "The rationale behind the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has evolved considerably since their approval for the treatment of hypertension. The initial rationale behind their use for the treatment of chronic heart failure was to duplicate with one agent the hemodynamic effects produced by the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate combination, i.e., increasing cardiac output while reducing ventricular filling pressures. The observation that the acute hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors did not predict long-term clinical benefits led to the search for mechanisms other than hemodynamic improvement. Attenuation or even reversal of left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction, which was first reported with ACE inhibition in an experimental model of myocardial infarction and subsequently in patients with recent myocardial infarction, provided a new rationale for the use of these inhibitors for chronic heart failure. However, this apparent prevention of left ventricular dilatation by ACE inhibitors is less apparent in patients with congestive heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (decreased ejection fraction) than in patients with recent myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the unexpected finding that long-term ACE inhibition decreases the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease and an already reduced systolic function, suggested the hypothesis that vascular protection may provide most of the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors. This hypothesis was successfully tested by demonstrating a lower incidence of cardiovascular events in high-risk vascular patients randomized to long-term ACE inhibition with ramipril. Accordingly, the current rationale behind the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure is largely that of vascular protection.", 
    "285": "Recent clinical studies suggest that some of the beneficial effects of 3-hydroxy-3-metylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on the incidence of myocardial infarctions and ischemic strokes may be through their non-cholesterol-lowering \"direct\" effects on atherosclerotic vessels. We designed this study to test the hypothesis that fluvastatin inhibits atheroma formation and increase plaque stability independent of cholesterol-lowering effects. Rabbits were fed 0.5% high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks (progression phase) and then fed the high-cholesterol diet either containing or not containing fluvastatin 2mg/kg per day for additional 8 weeks (treatment phase). Rabbits fed normal diet were used as control. Plasma total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations did not differ during the treatment phase of the experiment. Atherosclerotic changes (plaque formation, lipid- and macrophage-rich intimal thickening, the increase in MCP-1, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, M-CSF, MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-12, and ACE mRNA expression, and the increase in plasma MCP-1 levels) were observed in the high-cholesterol diet group (HC). All of these changes were less in the fluvastatin-treated group (HC+Flu) than in HC. There was no significant difference in aortic collagen (type I and type IV) mRNA expression between groups. Furthermore, fluvastatin increased the extracellular matrix content (collagen) and vascular smooth muscle cell composition in the atherosclerotic lesion, leading to the increase in plaque stability score (collagen+smooth muscle cell area)/(macrophage+lipid deposition area) in HC+Flu. Fluvastatin not only reduced atherogenesis but also to stabilized vulnerable atheromatous plaques in atherosclerotic rabbits, presumably through the macrophage recruitment and activation in the aortic lesion, at a low dose without cholesterol-lowering effects.", 
    "286": "The results of three clinical studies (OVERTURE, ENABLE and RENEWAL), in patients with cardiac failure, are analyzed from a pharmacological point of view. In the first one of these, the action of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor, that at the same time inhibits the neutral endopeptidase, is studied. In the second, a blockade for endothelin cellular receptors is studied and, in the third, a synthetic acceptor of the alpha-Tumoral Necrosis Factor is taken into account. In the OVERTURE study, the benefit action of the inhibition of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme in patients suffering from cardiac failure is confirmed, without a major effect from the neutral endopeptidase derived from its simultaneous inhibition. The other two studies were suspended because of the major side effects. The drugs used in OVERTURE, ENABLE and RENEWAL studies are relevant efforts of molecular design that, without any question, will project into the future of the therapeutic approach of cardiac failure. It is convenient to point out that in the task of designing clinical studies considering cellular signaling systems, there are other venues warranting their use in pathological or natural functions.",

In most patients, the choice of drug will be guided by the clinical situation in the individual patient, including the presence of target organ damage, diabetes, established vascular or kidney disease, or other comorbidities. In the absence of such clinical indications, start drug therapy with a low-dose diuretic. Combination therapy will be needed in around two-thirds of patients, and a diuretic will normally form one element of most combinations, with the second or third drug coming from among the remaining four.

Guyton provided experimental and analytical data supporting the role of renal pressure natriuresis in the regulation of normal circulation and its function resulting in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Hady and Overbeck proposed that the blood pressure of volume expanded hypertension was raised by a circulating inhibitor of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. Brenner et al proposed that hypertension may arise from a congenital reduction in the number of nephrons or in the filtration surface area per glomerulus, thereby limiting ability to excrete sodium, raising blood pressure. Renin angiotensin system can be interrupted at four sites by adrenergic blocker, renin inhibitor, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker. Non-modulation in the face of relatively high dietary sodium could explain the pathogenesis of sodium sensitive hypertension and provide a more targeted, rational therapy for its correction.", 
    "296": "To examine the possible role of the bradykinin-NO system in the action of ACE inhibitors, we studied the effects of imidapril, an ACE inhibitor, on inflammatory vascular injury by using AT1a-receptor-deficient (AT1aKO) mice. A polyethylene cuff was placed around the femoral artery of AT1aKO mice and wild-type (WT; C57BL/6J) mice. Neointimal area in cross sections of the artery was measured 14 days after cuff placement. A low dose of imidapril (1 mg/kg per day), which did not affect blood pressure, was administered by gavage. Expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was detected by immunohistochemical staining and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 7 days after the operation. Neointimal formation, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and expression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha were attenuated in the injured artery in AT1aKO mice compared with those in WT mice. Imidapril inhibited neointimal formation, DNA synthesis of vascular smooth muscle cells, and expression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha in AT1aKO mice as well as in WT mice. In addition, imidapril increased tissue cGMP content after cuff placement. These inhibitory effects of imidapril were significantly reduced or abolished by a bradykinin receptor antagonist, Hoechst 140, or an NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, both in WT and AT1aKO mice. Treatment with imidapril did not change AT2 receptor and ACE expression detected by RT-PCR in the injured artery. These results indicate that not only blockade of angiotensin II production but also activation of the bradykinin-NO system plays an important role in the beneficial effects of imidapril on vascular remodeling.",

The patients were divided into three groups depending on renal function: group A (with plasma creatinine <150 micromol/L), group B (151-250 micromol/L), and group C (>250 micromol/L). All patients were studied for 1 year. Erythropoietin use did not affect renal function, proteinuria or number of antihypertensive drugs group.

Compliance with telmisartan/HCTZ 80/12.5 mg/day was 98.9%. In patients with hypertension, telmisartan/HCTZ resulted in similar BP reductions to oral enalapril/HCTZ and atenolol/HCTZ in 26-week double-blind trials and greater reductions than oral losartan/HCTZ 50/12.5 mg/day in a 6-week randomised open-label trial (p < 0.001). Up to one-third of patients with hypertension initially responsive to telmisartan 40 or 80 mg/day in a 4-year study required the eventual addition of HCTZ 12.5 or 25 mg/day and/or another agent to maintain BP control. BP was controlled in about 75% of these by adding only HCTZ.

The S40-13 stretching pattern simulated normal breathing. The other patterns were chosen to study increased amplitude and frequency. There were no significant differences between the S40-13 group and static cultures.

Frequency of use in hospitals with and without facilities for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) was investigated, and outcomes were analysed. Results show that younger patients (<60 years), those receiving antiplatelet therapies, thrombolytics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, patients admitted to hospitals with PCI facilities, and patients undergoing invasive procedures were more likely to receive UFH, or both UFH and LMWH than LMWH alone (80.1% enoxaparin, 19.9% other LMWH). LMWH was used less often in US than non-US sites. After adjusting for confounding variables, patients receiving LMWH had significantly lower rates of hospital mortality (P = 0.009) and major bleeding (P < 0.0001). Similar results were observed in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

Measurements were disability (defined as a Barthel Index score < or =99/100) and dependency (a positive response to the following question: \"In the last 2 weeks has the patient required regular help with everyday activities?\").", 
    "315": "The median duration of follow-up was 4 years. At the last available assessment, 19% of the active treatment group and 22% of the placebo group were disabled (adjusted odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.89; P<0.001). Twelve percent of the active treatment group and 14% of the placebo group were dependent (adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.99; P=0.04). The effects of treatment appeared to be mediated primarily through the prevention of disability and dependency associated with recurrent stroke. Four-year treatment with the study drug regimen would be expected to result in the avoidance of 1 case of long-term disability for every 30 (95% CI, 19 to 79) patients.", 
    "316": "Among individuals with cerebrovascular disease, a perindopril-based blood pressure-lowering regimen not only reduced the risk of stroke and major vascular events but also substantially reduced the risks of associated long-term disability and dependency.", 
    "317": "Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(S1)-casein (alpha(S1)-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-CN f58-76; ovine alpha(S1)-CN f1-6 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-CN f58-65 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-187; buffalo beta-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC(50)s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.", 
    "318": "It has been shown that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) plays an important role in the progression of liver fibrosis. TIMP-1 gene expression is regulated by several factors in vivo. Among them, angiotensin-II (AT-II) induces TIMP-1 in endothelial cells (EC) in vitro, however, the interaction between these molecules in liver fibrogenesis has not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to examine a possible association between TIMP-1 and AT-II both in vitro and in vivo using the clinically available angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril (PE), and the AT-II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), candesartan (CA). In cultured activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC), AT-II increased TIMP-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CA and LY 333531, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, blocked this augmentation in a dose-dependent manner. In the CCl(4)- and pig serum-induced rat liver fibrosis model, a clinically comparable low dose of PE and CA significantly suppressed liver fibrosis development associated with the suppression of TIMP-1 expression in the liver. AT-II induces TIMP-1 via type 1 receptor and PKC as an intracellular signaling pathway in activated HSC. These results suggested that the AT-II-induced TIMP-1 plays an important role in liver fibrosis development.", 
    "319": "The effects of S-nitrosocaptopril (SNOcap), administered either intravenously or by oral gavage, on pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) were examined in anaesthetised normotensive rats and rats with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (10% oxygen for 1 week). Mean PAP (MPAP) values in hypoxic and normoxic rats were (mmHg) 26 +/- 1.7 and 15 +/- 1.1, respectively. When given intravenously, 1 mg kg(-1) SNOcap reduced MPAP by 28 and 32% in hypoxic and normoxic rats, respectively. The effects of 2 mg kg(-1) were no greater than those of 1 mg kg(-1). Pulmonary vasodepressor responses reached equilibrium in 1.7 +/- 0.18 min following intravenous administration. When given orally 30 min before the measurement of PAP, 30 mg kg(-1), but not 10 mg kg(-1), significantly reduced MPAP in hypoxic rats to 17 +/- 1.5 mmHg. These in-vivo data are consistent with previous in-vitro data showing that SNOcap has direct pulmonary vasorelaxant properties in both large and small pulmonary arteries and also show that SNOcap causes pulmonary vasodepression in the setting of pulmonary hypertension. Since SNOcap also inhibits pulmonary vascular angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in pulmonary blood vessels (previous study), it would be an interesting drug with which to assess the benefits of direct pulmonary vasodilatation combined with ACE inhibition (which attenuates pulmonary vascular remodelling) in a long-term study in pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "320": "The interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and nitric oxide (NO) is undeniable, but its nature is not fully known. This study investigated the contribution of NO to the acute hypotensive effect of captopril in conscious normotensive rats and the effect on blood pressure of dual administration of captopril and the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor zaprinast. In two separate experiments, rats were pretreated with the NO inhibitor L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and with the NO enhancer zaprinast. Pretreatment with L-NAME attenuated and pretreatment with zaprinast potentiated the hypotensive effect of captopril. The hypotensive effect of captoril was not associated with a significant change in the plasma level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). These findings suggest that NO contributes to the blood pressure-lowering effect of captopril. The inability of captopril to alter plasma cGMP levels is not consistent with this view, however, and leads to the conclusion that NO contributes to the acute hypotensive effect of captopril, although the mechanism is not fully understood. Zaprinast potentiates the hypotensive effect of captopril, and an adjustment in dose should be considered when this combination is administered.",

Idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) has been reported to coexist with FSGS, but rarely with CG. We report 3 HIV-negative patients (2 men, 1 woman) who developed nephrotic syndrome secondary to MGN complicated by CG, with relatively rapid disease progression despite aggressive therapy.", 
    "322": "The most important issues facing clinicians is the transfer of evidence from clinical trials into practice. Physician, patient and community acceptance of the evidence are key components of this process. Although barriers to this exist, in the case of transfer of evidence from the Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) into clinical practice, these are minimal. Hence, transfer of this information into clinical practice should put blood pressure lowering in place as the fourth major secondary prevention strategy for stroke.", 
    "323": "High blood pressure is a known risk factor for stroke and dementia. However, very little is known about the prevention of dementia by lowering blood pressure. Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) was designed to determine the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-based blood pressure-lowering regimen on the risk of stroke among individuals with a prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). One of the important aims of the study was to test the hypothesis that treatment would reduce the incidence of dementia and cognitive decline. A total of 6105 patients were randomized to active treatment or placebo. Active treatment comprised perindopril for all participants, and indapamide for those with neither a specific indication for, nor a contraindication to, a diuretic. Dementia was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. Cognitive decline was defined as a drop of 3 points or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) between baseline and final follow-up. During a median follow-up of 3.9 years, dementia was diagnosed in 410 patients and cognitive decline in 610. Active treatment reduced the risk of cognitive decline (risk reduction [RR] 19%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4-32; P = 0.01] but there was no clear reduction in the risk of dementia (RR, 12%; 95% CI, -8-28; P = 0.2]). The RR for cognitive outcomes preceded by a recurrent stroke was 34% (95% CI, 3-55; P = 0.03) for dementia and 45% (95% CI, 21-61; P = <0.001) for cognitive decline. Among individuals with a history of stroke or TIA, blood pressure-lowering treatment reduced the risk of cognitive decline by about one fifth. Cognitive decline and dementia associated with recurrent stroke during follow-up were each reduced by between one third and one half. These findings provide further support for the recommendation that blood pressure lowering with perindopril and indapamide be considered for all patients with cerebrovascular disease.",

Active treatment consisted of a flexible regimen based on the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily), with the addition of the diuretic indapamide, at the discretion of treating physicians. The primary outcome was total stroke (fatal or non-fatal). Analysis was by intention to treat.", 
    "326": "Active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9/4 mmHg over 4 years of follow-up. 307 (10%) individuals assigned active treatment suffered a stroke, compared with 420 (14%) assigned placebo [relative risk reduction 28% (95% confidence interval 17-38), P < 0.0001]. Active treatment also reduced the risks of total major vascular events [26% (16-34)] including non-fatal myocardial infarction [38% (14-55)], severe cognitive decline [19% (4-32)], stroke-related dementia [34% (3-55)] and disability [18% (8-28)]. There were similar reductions in the risk of stroke in hypertensive and non-hypertensive subgroups (P < 0.01). Combination therapy with perindopril plus indapamide lowered blood pressure by 12/5 mmHg and stroke risk by 43%. Single-drug therapy lowered blood pressure by 5/3 mmHg and produced no significant fall in the risk of stroke.",

Combination therapy with perindopril and indapamide produced larger blood pressure reductions and larger stroke reductions than monotherapy with perindopril alone. Treatment with these two agents should be considered routinely for all patients with a history of previous stroke or TIA, whether hypertensive or normotensive.", 
    "328": "Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the world, and the worldwide burden from stroke will increase further during the 21st century. Major advances in the treatment and prevention of stroke have occurred but additional measures are needed. Much of the modern care of stroke mimics the modern treatment of heart disease, in part because of the success of thrombolytic therapy in improving outcomes. Nevertheless, the impact of thrombolytic therapy is limited because of the short therapeutic window. Additional measures are needed to limit the neurological consequences of stroke. Prevention remains a critical component of the management of patients with cerebrovascular disease. Although surgical therapies and antithrombotic medications (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) are effective in lessening the likelihood of stroke or recurrent stroke, new strategies are needed to lower the risk further. Measures aimed at stabilizing the vascular endothelium or preventing fracture of atherosclerotic plaques show great promise. Medications including cholesterol-lowering agents and antihypertensive medications, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, appear effective in stroke prevention. These agents could be combined with antithrombotic agents and surgical interventions to lessen the risk of stroke.", 
    "329": "Cadmium (0.1, 0.32, 1.0 mg/kg i.v.) produced dose dependent hypertensive response in pentobarbitone anesthetized Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats. The peak hypertensive effect was observed within 15 min of cadmium administration. This response gradually decreased over 1-h observation period. Heart rate did not change significantly. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased with cadmium administration. The lower dose of cadmium (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) increased serum MDA to 0.14 +/- 0.02 nmol/mL as compared to 0.12 +/- 0.01 nmol/mL in the control group and was not statistically significant. However, mid (0.32 mg/kg i.v.) and high doses (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) raised serum MDA levels significantly (P < 0.01). Cadmium inhibited serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels at all the three tested doses and was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Captopril (1.0, 3.2 mg/kg i.v.) produced a dose dependent mild hypotensive response. The peak effect was observed within 5 min. Cadmium produced inhibition of serum ACE levels, however, a dose response effect was not observed. Captopril (3.2 mg/kg i.v.) decreased serum ACE levels to 5.4 +/- 1.1 U/mL (control levels 10.7 +/- 1.4 U/mL). Serum MDA levels were decreased by captopril treatment. A correlation between serum ACE and MDA following higher dose of cadmium was found. These results indicate that acute administration of cadmium, an inorganic blocker of ACE and calcium channels cadmium produced hypertensive response while captopril produced mild hypotensive response in rats.", 
    "330": "Gastrointestinal digestion is of major importance in the bioavailability of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides, bioactive peptides with possible antihypertensive effects. In this study, the conditions of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion leading to the formation and degradation of ACE inhibitory peptides were investigated for pea and whey protein. In batch experiments, the digestion simulating the physiological conditions sufficed to achieve the highest ACE inhibitory activity, with IC(50) values of 0.076 mg/mL for pea and 0.048 mg/mL for whey protein. The degree of proteolysis did not correlate with the ACE inhibitory activity and was always higher for pea than whey. In a semicontinuous model of gastrointestinal digestion, response surface methodology studied the influence of temperature and incubation time in both the stomach and small intestine phases on the ACE inhibitory activity and degree of proteolysis. For pea protein, a linear model for the degree of proteolysis and a quadratic model for the ACE inhibitory activity could be constituted. Within the model, a maximal degree of proteolysis was observed at the highest temperature and the longest incubation time in the small intestine phase, while maximal ACE inhibitory activity was obtained at the longest incubation times in the stomach and small intestine phase. These results show that ACE inhibitory activity of pea and whey hydrolysates can be controlled by the conditions of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.", 
    "331": "Butein (3,4,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone), a plant polyphenol, has been known to elucidate endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In the present study, the hypotensive effect of butein and its possible mechanism, especially an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory effect, were investigated. Intravenous injection of butein lowered the arterial blood pressure of anesthetized rats in a dose-dependent manner. The plasma ACE activities were significantly inhibited by the addition of butein in a dose-dependent manner, the IC(50) value of which was 198 microg/ml (730 microM). Moreover, angiotensin I-induced contraction was markedly attenuated by prior exposure of endothelium-intact aortic rings to butein, but angiotensin II-induced contraction was not altered. These results suggest that butein has a hypotensive effect, at least in part, via the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "332": "It is of interest that the drugs having the most significant impact on total and sudden death mortality are those without direct electrophysiologic actions on myocardial excitable tissue. This observation may provide insight into mechanisms responsible for ventricular tachyarrhythmias causing cardiac arrest. One way to think about ventricular fibrillation is that it is the final common pathway of an electrically unstable heart. After all, the heart can \"die\" in only three major ways: electromechanical dissociation, asystole and heart block, and ventricular fibrillation, with the latter most common. It is the \"upstream\" events provoking the electrical instability that these drugs probably act upon (i.e., ischemia, fibrosis). Although we unquestionably need to pursue investigations into the electrophysiology of these ventricular tachyarrhythmias, more studies need to investigate the drugs affecting upstream events, because these agents appear to yield the greatest dividends, at least for the present. This article reviews these drugs and how they may be effective.", 
    "333": "ACE inhibition (ACEi) reduces proteinuria and provides reno-protection, but not all subjects benefit from ACEi. Individual differences in the reduction in proteinuria at the onset of treatment and in residual proteinuria during therapy predict differences in renal outcome. The present study investigated whether individual differences in the anti-proteinuric efficacy of ACEi are explained by differences in the severity of pretreatment renal structural damage and whether differences in the level of residual proteinuria during therapy are explained by the severity of renal structural damage at that time, in adriamycin nephrosis in the rat. Pretreatment renal structural damage was assessed in biopsies 6 weeks after exposure to adriamycin (2 mg/kg iv). Then ACEi (75 mg/l lisinopril, n = 23) or vehicle (n = 10) was administered; renal biopsies were repeated after stabilization of the anti-proteinuric response (week 8). Early renal damage (interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and macrophage accumulation) and established lesions [focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) and interstitial fibrosis] were scored. During ACEi, proteinuria fell from 834 (487-851) mg/24 h pretreatment to 153 (66-265) mg/24 h at week 8 (p < 0.05); FGS stabilized from 27 (4-70) arbitrar units (AU) pretreatment to 26 (4-84) at week 12, whereas the vehicle did not affect proteinuria, resulting in progressive FGS: 18 (10-26) AU pretreatment versus 88 (46-130) at week 12 (p < 0.05). All parameters of pretreatment damage significantly predicted the anti-proteinuric response. Residual proteinuria during ACEi correlated significantly with renal structural damage parameters at that time. Pretreatment renal damage also predicted renal outcome during extended treatment. Thus, in this experimental setting, in rats with the same renal disorder and the same duration of disease, individual differences in pretreatment renal damage, albeit relatively modest, explain individual differences in renal responsiveness to ACEi. This implies that the limits of the efficacy of ACEi are set by prevalent renal damage. Further studies into the mechanisms of individual resistance to the anti-proteinuric action of ACEi are needed to develop additive intervention strategies.", 
    "334": "The crystal structure of polymorphic Form II of enalapril maleate, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was determined from high-resolution X-ray diffraction data using the direct space method. Enalapril maleate Form II crystallizes in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), Z = 4, with unit cell parameters a = 33.9898(3) A, b = 11.2109(1) A, c = 6.64195(7) A, and V = 2530.96(5) A(3). By treating the molecules as rigid bodies and using the bond lengths and angles obtained from the X-ray single crystal structures of Form I, which were solved almost 20 years ago, the total degrees of freedom of enalapril maleate were reduced from 25 to 12. This reduction in total degrees of freedom allowed the simulated annealing to complete within a reasonable computation time. In the crystal structure of Form II, the crystal packing, hydrogen-bonding pattern, and conformation of enalapril maleate resemble those in the structure of Form I. The crystal packing and conformation of enalapril maleate in the two polymorphic forms may explain the similarity of the thermal properties, (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared, and Raman spectra of Forms I and II. In both structures, the conformations of the main peptide chains, which are considered responsible for binding the active angiotensin-converting enzyme sites, remain largely unchanged. Lattice energy calculation showed that Form II is slightly more stable than Form I by 3.5 kcal/mole.", 
    "335": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in the hydroelectrolytic balance, blood pressure regulation, and cell growth. In some studies, the insertion (I) allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, associated with a lower ACE activity, has been found in excess frequency in elite endurance athletes, suggesting that decreased ACE activity could be involved in endurance performance (Myerson S, Hemingway H, Budget R, Martin J, Humphries S, and Montgomery H. J Appl Physiol 87: 1313-1316, 1999). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated whether ACE inhibition could be associated with improved endurance performance and muscle oxidative capacity in rats. Eight male Wistar rats were treated for 10-12 wk with an ACE inhibitor, perindopril (2 mg.kg-1.day-1), and compared with eight control rats. Endurance time was measured on a treadmill, and oxidative capacity and regulation of mitochondrial respiration by substrates were evaluated in saponin-permeabilized fibers of slow soleus and fast gastrocnemius muscles. Endurance time did not differ between groups (57 +/- 5 min for perindopril vs. 55 +/- 6 min for control). Absolute and relative (to body weight) left ventricular weight was 20% (P < 0.01) and 12% (P < 0.01) lower, respectively, in the treated group. No difference in oxidative capacity, mitochondrial enzyme activities, or mitochondrial regulation by ADP was observed in soleus or gastrocnemius. Mitochondrial respiration with glycerol 3-phosphate was 17% higher in gastrocnemius (P < 0.03) and with octanoylcarnitine 14% greater in soleus (P < 0.01) of treated rats. These results demonstrate that ACE inhibition was not associated with improved endurance time and maximal oxidative capacity of skeletal muscles. This suggests that ACE activity has no implication in endurance capacity and only minor effects on mitochondrial function in sedentary animals.", 
    "336": "Pustular eruptions caused by anti-hypertension drugs are relatively rare. They have been reported with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor antagonists, as a new class of drug for hypertension, has become an established and popular treatment. We describe a patient with generalized pustular psoriasis induced by candesartan cilexetil (AT1 receptor antagonist), who was previously diagnosed as flexural psoriasis. It is known that AT1 receptor antagonists do not increase the bradykinin level, inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system more potently than ACE inhibitor. But our results suggest that AT 1 receptor antagonists could have some ACE inhibitor potency as an up-regulator for bradykinin in our patient, with pustular eruptions developing on the psoriatic background. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of pustular psoriasis associated with AT1 receptor antagonists.", 
    "337": "Four potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides, IY, RIY, VW and VWIS, were isolated from subtilisin digest of rapeseed protein. Among them RIY and VWIS are new peptides with IC(50) 28 and 30 microM, respectively. All isolated peptides lowered blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) following oral administration. The maximum effect in the case of RIY was observed 4h after administration, while maximum effect of other peptides on blood pressure occurred 2h after administration. Furthermore, the antihypertensive effect of RIY was observed even in old rats, in which ACE inhibitors become less effective, suggesting that a different mechanism other than ACE inhibition is also involved in lowering blood pressure by this peptide. Subtilisin digest of rapeseed protein also significantly lowered blood pressure of SHR after oral administration of a single dosage 0.15 g/kg, exerting maximum antihypertensive effect 4h after administration. This digest appears promising as a functional food, which may be useful in the prevention and treatment of hypertension.", 
    "338": "The inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II is necessary to ensure the best degree of renal protection by the simultaneous control of blood pressure (BP) and the achievement of the maximal antiproteinuric capacity. The inhibition can be attained through the administration of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Uptitration of antihypertensive therapy is frequently required to achieve the desired BP goal in patients presenting with renal disease, with or without proteinuria. Control of BP is good for both cardiovascular and renal protection. Sometimes, in particular when BP levels are high in the absence of therapy, the simple control of BP without inhibiting the renin- angiotensin system can be accompanied by a significant drop in proteinuria. On the other hand, the possibility that an ACE inhibitor or an ARB diminishes protein excretion in urine in the absence of changes in BP has been considered after the known evidence that these classes of drugs are renoprotective independently of their effect on BP control. The aim of this paper is to briefly review the evidence in favor of uptitration of either class of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system as compared with the combination of the two for the control of either BP or proteinuria.", 
    "339": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), two drug classes that effectively block the actions of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), have unique capabilities as antihypertensive agents. Recent landmark clinical trials have demonstrated their important roles as primary therapy for the prevention of renal disease in diabetes. The optimal dosage of these RAS blockers required to slow the progression of renal disease or impair the development of cardiovascular risk is not known. However, data from many studies strongly support the use of the higher doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs to reduce proteinuria. All studies of kidney disease progression demonstrate benefit on slowing only when blood pressure is reduced when using higher doses. In order to accrue the optimum benefit from ACE inhibitors and ARBs, the dose-response relationship for diabetic renal disease will have to be determined. The best strategy, ie, supramaximal doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs or combining them, is still a matter of debate but may be resolved soon by results of ongoing studies.", 
    "340": "The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) confers markedly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension. Regression of left ventricular (LV) mass with antihypertensive therapy is associated with reduction in cardiovascular events. In studies based on monotherapy, among the classes of antihypertensive drugs that have been adequately tested, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be the most effective agents for reducing LV mass. New avenues of research, based on combination antihypertensive therapy and on a more sophisticated understanding of the molecular mechanisms of LVH, may yield new pharmacologic approaches to regressing LV mass.", 
    "341": "Hypertension increases the renal and cardiovascular risks in diabetic patients. The beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on renal and cardiovascular outcomes are discussed in this paper, with a particular focus on their optimal use in the hypertensive diabetic patient, with or without evidence of renal or cardiovascular disease. Although the mechanism of action of the two drug classes is not entirely similar, there is no evidence of differences in their clinical effects. Importantly, the achieved risk reduction with either drug is not similar across subsets of diabetic patients. Overt nephropathy of type 2 diabetes appears poorly responsive even to maximized renin-angiotensin system inhibition. This urgently calls for new interventions that may decrease renal and cardiovascular risk through other mechanisms than blood pressure lowering alone. Improving the outcome of type 2 diabetics is the major clinical challenge for the beginning of the third millennium.", 
    "342": "With the increasing use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in the treatment of hypertension, particularly in diabetic patients, and heart failure, an annoying cough has frequently been observed. According to the post marketing surveillance studies, the prevalence of cough associated with ACEI was only 0.1-4 per cent. However, many recent studies have observed a very much higher frequency. To examine the incidence and pattern of cough associated with the usage of ACEI (C-ACEI) in a Thai population, mixed retrospective and prospective studies were performed in hypertensive patients who attended the out-patient department, Siriraj Hospital between December 1999 and August 2000. A thousand cases who had used or have been using ACEI were studied. C-ACEI was present in 179 cases of 760 retrospective studied cases (23.6%) and 75 cases of 240 prospective studied cases (31.3%). Cough was typically described as irritative (93.8% retrospectively and 98.7% prospectively, p = 0.05) and nocturnal in onset (74.9% retrospectively and 80% prospectively, p = 0.12), and usually appeared within the first 4 weeks of treatment (41.3% retrospectively and 46.7% prospectively, p = 0.43). Patients who received a full dosage of ACEI did not have to posses an increasing risk of C-ACEI. There was no difference in the prevalence of C-ACEI among types of ACEI, except cilazapril and quinapril which were found to be higher than enalapril in the retrospective study (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Types of study were shown to influence the prevalence of C-ACEI. Prospective studies yielded a higher rate of C-ACEI than retrospective ones.",

The thiolesterase hydrolyzes not only the thiolester bond in alacepril, spironolactone, and acetyl coenzyme A but also the carboxylester bond in alpha-naphtyl acetate. The alacepril thiolestrase activity is competitively inhibited by alpha-naphtyl acetate.",

In the United States, the incidence and prevalence of CHF have been shown to increase with age, particularly among the elderly (age >/=65 years). In addition, more elderly persons are living in or will be living in nursing homes. Given these trends, it is important to consider the quality of care, including pharmacologic treatment, received by elderly nursing home residents with a diagnosis of CHE There is currently a lack of clinical trial data on the pharmacologic treatment of CHF among elderly nursing home residents and, therefore, no standard of care.

The search was limited to the past 11 years (1991-2002) to identify current patterns of treatment in the population of interest. Additional studies were identified through a manual search of the reference lists of the retrieved articles.",

The findings of these studies indicated that ACE inhibitors are underused, are often prescribed at clinically inefficient doses, and are used more often in \"young\" elderly nursing home residents (age 65-74 years). Among patients who received a prescription for digoxin, many did not have an appropriate indication (eg, no documented atrial fibrillation, normal sinus rhythm). Similarly, diuretics were found to be inappropriately prescribed to elderly nursing home residents for the treatment of CHF.",

The case notes of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with class 4 nephritis and who were given standard pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy during the period 1990-2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Primary outcomes were doubling of serum creatinine and development of end stage renal disease (ESRD). Secondary outcomes were return of proteinuria to normal and renal remission. A total of 117 patients had a renal biopsy for SLE nephritis at the UHWI between 1990 and 2000. Of the patients, 34 (29%) had diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (WHO class 4), of which 29 were reviewed. Twenty-two patients of 24 in whom it was measured (92%) had significant proteinuria at presentation. The 24-hour proteinuria was measured at final review in 16 patients and in 10 patients it went into complete remission. At the beginning of therapy, 24 patients (83%) had renal impairment. Of the 18 who had final creatinine values, the renal function returned to normal in eight patients (44%) and an additional six patients showed a significant improvement in renal function at final review. Six patients developed end stage renal disease (ESRD). The risk (95% confidence interval) of developing ESRD at one year was 16.2% (CI, 6.4-37.6) and at two years was 23.2% (CI, 10.0-48.5). There were three deaths, two from sepsis and one from heart failure. The one-year mortality (95% CI) was 8% (CI, 2.0-28.5), the two-year mortality was 15.6% (CI, 4.9-43.5) and the five-year mortality was also 15.6% (CI, 4.9-43.5).

Some of these appear to be related not to the reduction in systemic blood pressure induced by candesartan, but to its blockage of intrarenal angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptors. Initial studies have shown that renal vascular resistance was reduced in patients with hypertension receiving candesartan, and urinary albumin excretion was reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and concomitant microalbuminuria or proteinuria. These findings, together with the results of recently published large randomized studies involving diabetic patients with hypertension treated with other angiotensin II receptor blockers, indicate that this class of drugs is beneficial in preventing the development or progression of diabetic nephropathy. This review summarizes the large body of findings related to these renoprotective effects and reported during experimental and clinical research on candesartan for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "364": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists attenuate fibrosis in the kidney, heart, and liver by suppressing transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA and decreasing production of extracellular matrix proteins. We recently demonstrated that lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, alleviates pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis in male Wistar Bonn/Kobori rats. The involvement of angiotensin II receptor and its receptor interaction in the pathogenesis of spontaneous chronic pancreatitis was assessed in this model. Candesartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, was administered in drinking water (10.5, 42, or 125 mg/l) to 10-week-old male WBN/Kob rats for 10 weeks and inflammatory parameters, fibrosis, and gene expression of renin-angiotensin system components and transforming growth factor-beta1 were assessed in the pancreas. Immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin was also performed. Candesartan significantly suppressed decrease in pancreatic weight and increases in pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity, hydroxyproline content, ratio of fibrous tissue, histologic scores, and ratio of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells (activated pancreatic stellate cells) at 20 weeks. The high dose enhanced the expression of angiotensinogen and angiotensin II receptor type 2 mRNA and suppressed the overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA. The conclusion is that candesartan alleviates chronic pancreatitis and fibrosis by suppressing the overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta1, resulting in prevention of activation of pancreatic stellate cells in male WBN/Kob rats. We propose that angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonists may be useful for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis involving angiotensin II interaction with its receptor.",

However, effects of ACE inhibitors during long-term therapy have not always been optimal. In recent years, aldosterone breakthrough has been suggested as a factor potentially involved, in that aldosterone levels may not remain suppressed when an ACE inhibitor is given for a relatively long time, with circulating aldosterone concentrations perhaps increasing above pretreatment levels. To improve our understanding of aldosterone-induced organ damage, which has attracted much attention in recent years, we summarize the data on aldosterone breakthrough during ACE inhibitor treatment in various diseases, and then we consider the mechanism and clinical significance of aldosterone breakthrough. Given the wide range of indications for ACE inhibitors, further studies should be designed to examine in which diseases and for which types of patients aldosterone blockade will be indicated. At present, the mechanisms of aldosterone breakthrough remain obscure, requiring further studies, including those on regional nonepithelial effects of aldosterone.",

Treatment with C5 decreased LDL tendency to peroxidation (lag time was prolonged by 43%, P <.05; malonyldialdehyde levels decreased by 8.3%). The combined treatment of C2.5,HCTz achieved the same BP reduction, but did not increase LDL resistance to peroxidation.

Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at baseline and for each active treatment. Small doses of thiazide diuretic were added as needed. The effects of both drugs on 24-hour BP were almost identical and satisfactory.

Comparators used is the studies were not angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors but typically conventional hypertensive therapy plus placebo, placebo alone and in one case, amlodipine. These trials have reported reductions in progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) (losartan and irbesartan) and to nephropathy (irbesartan). An important pharmacoeconomic question is whether potential cost-savings on reduced progression to ESRD and nephropathy outweigh the extra costs of A-II-antagonist treatment. This paper will review the published economic studies for A-II-receptor antagonists and their pharmacoeconomic implications. In particular, potential pharmacoeconomic implications and related methodological aspects of the recent RENAAL trial for losartan are considered.", 
    "384": "Are lives saved or heart attacks prevented by antihypertensive therapy, as a result of blood pressure reduction alone, or because of other properties of the antihypertensive medications which are independent of blood pressure lowering? Long-acting calcium antagonists seem to be as effective as thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in preventing all-cause mortality and stroke in patients with hypertension, but are probably inferior to ACE inhibitors in preventing coronary artery disease. In patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, calcium antagonists are generally as effective as beta-blockers in relieving angina and improving exercise time-to-onset of angina or ischaemia. Unstable angina or myocardial infarction require treatment with a beta-blocker, with an ACE inhibitor added when necessary for blood pressure control or if there is significant left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. If beta-blockers are contraindicated and if there is no LV dysfunction, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist can be substituted.", 
    "385": "Current recommendations for the treatment of hypertension clarify the need to achieve lower blood pressure levels in the general population (<140/90 mm Hg) and in specific high-risk patient groups such as patients with diabetes or chronic renal disease (<130/80 mm Hg). Further, it is evident that to reach appropriate blood pressure control, most patients with high blood pressure will require two or more antihypertensive agents. There is scarce clinical trial outcome evidence to guide clinicians in the selection of optimal combinations of antihypertensive classes for high-risk hypertensive patients. A new clinical trial, Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH), is the first large clinical trial to directly compare cardiovascular mortality and morbidity rates for two fixed-dose combination therapies. Results from ACCOMPLISH should provide much-needed guidance for selecting optimal combination therapy for high-risk hypertensive patients.", 
    "386": "There is currently consensus regarding the need to initiate antihypertensive therapy with a combination of two agents from different antihypertensive classes in selected patients. This consensus extends to the need to bring blood pressure to the appropriate level but has not been defined regarding optimal strategies for selection of combinations that may be most effective at reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. Because of the heterogeneous nature of hypertension, there may be unique population-specific strategies for selecting antihypertensive regimens. Appropriate combinations of antihypertensive agents are particularly relevant for patients with diabetes, renal disease, and isolated systolic hypertension as well as for African Americans with high-risk hypertension. The antihypertensive regimen for high-risk patients should be based on those agents for which the patient has compelling indications, with the addition of agents deemed most likely to bring the patient to the appropriate blood pressure goal as quickly as possible.", 
    "387": "Major randomized clinical trials have demonstrated unquestionable clinical benefits of lowering blood pressure without establishing superiority of any specific antihypertensive medication. Most notably, these trials have indicated that a majority of patients with hypertension will require more than one drug to control blood pressure. The recognition that many patients with hypertension should receive a combination of two agents as initial therapy is reflected in current hypertension guidelines, including the recently published consensus statement by the Hypertension in African Americans Working Group (HAAWG) and the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7). In addition, there are some data that suggest that combination therapy may afford greater cardioprotection compared to monotherapy. For example, findings from A Lotrel Evaluation of Hypertensive Patients with Arterial Stiffness and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (ALERT) indicated that low-dose combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium channel blocker antihypertensive treatment improved measures of cardiovascular structure and function compared with high-dose monotherapy with either component. Intuitive clinical wisdom suggests that some combinations of antihypertensive agents may provide enhanced clinical benefits; however, clinical trial data have not established optimal combination regimens. Thus, a challenging task for investigators is to determine which combination therapy regimens will provide the greatest cardiovascular benefits for patients with hypertension. A trial that is now in progress, Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH), directly compares cardiovascular mortality and morbidity rates for two preselected, fixed-dose combination therapies.", 
    "388": "Recent hypertension guidelines recommend initiating antihypertensive therapy with a combination of two or more agents in patients whose blood pressure exceeds their appropriate blood pressure goal by 20/10 mm Hg. This recommendation is based on the knowledge that the majority of patients with blood pressures of this magnitude will not achieve sufficient blood pressure reduction with monotherapy. Further, compared with high-dose monotherapy, combination therapy is often associated with fewer adverse effects and, for this reason, may improve patient adherence. Bringing patients to blood pressure goal quickly is likely to improve clinical outcomes. This article discusses the rationale for using combination antihypertensive therapy as initial therapy for high blood pressure in selected patients and reviews data from a study of 364 high-risk patients with Stage 2 hypertension in which a fixed-dose combination product (amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl) proved more successful as initial therapy than high-dose monotherapy (amlodipine besylate) in reducing blood pressure.", 
    "389": "Stimulation of cardiomyocyte guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) via endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) is an important mechanism by which bradykinin and ACE inhibitors prevent hypertrophy. Endothelial NO dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy are morbid features of diabetes not entirely prevented by ACE inhibitors. In cardiomyocyte/endothelial cell cocultures, bradykinin efficacy is abolished by high-glucose-induced endothelial NO dysfunction. We now demonstrate that antihypertrophic actions of natriuretic peptides, which stimulate cyclic GMP independently of NO, are preserved in cardiomyocytes despite high-glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction. Further, streptozotocin-induced diabetes significantly impairs the effectiveness of acute antihypertrophic strategies in isolated rat hearts. In hearts from citrate-treated control rats, angiotensin II-stimulated [(3)H]phenylalanine incorporation and atrial natriuretic peptide and beta-myosin heavy chain mRNA expression were prevented by B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), bradykinin, the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat, and the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor candoxatrilat. These antihypertrophic effects were accompanied by increased left ventricular cyclic GMP. In age-matched diabetic hearts, the antihypertrophic and cyclic GMP stimulatory actions of bradykinin, ramiprilat, and candoxatrilat were absent. However, the blunting of hypertrophic markers and accompanying increases in cyclic GMP stimulated by BNP were preserved in diabetes. Thus BNP, which increases cyclic GMP independently of NO, is an important approach to prevent growth in the diabetic myocardium, where endothelium-dependent mechanisms are compromised.", 
    "390": "Excretion of growth factors in the urine has been implicated in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial disease that characterizes proteinuric renal disease.

Of these, 10 subjects were normoalbuminuric, 8 were microalbuminuric and not receiving ACE inhibitor treatment, and 13 were macroalbuminuric, 8 of whom were receiving ACE inhibitor treatment. Urinary CTGF NH(2)-terminal fragment (CTGF-N) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and expressed relative to urinary creatinine.",

In comparison with normoalbuminuric subjects, urinary CTGF-N was increased 10- and 100-fold in micro- and untreated macroalbuminuric subjects, respectively (CTGF-N-to-creatinine ratio: normoalbuminuria 0.23 x// 1.3 ng/mg, microalbuminuria 2.1 x// 1.7 ng/mg, untreated macroalbuminuria 203 x// 3.8 ng/mg, and geometric mean x// tolerance factor; P < 0.05 for normoalbuminuria versus microalbuminuria, P < 0.001 for microalbuminuria versus macroalbuminuria). Urinary CTGF-N was lower (<30-fold) in macroalbuminuric subjects treated with ACE inhibitors (6.5 x// 1.7 ng/mg; P < 0.01 vs. untreated macroalbuminuria) compared with their untreated counterparts.", 
    "393": "In this cross-sectional study, the magnitude of urinary CTGF-N excretion was related to the severity of diabetic nephropathy. In the context of its known profibrotic actions, these findings suggest that CTGF may contribute to the chronic tubulointerstitial fibrosis that accompanies proteinuric renal disease. Prospective and interventional studies will be needed to determine whether urinary CTGF-N may provide a reliable surrogate marker of renal injury and a meaningful indicator of response to therapy.", 
    "394": "The renin-angiotensin system is activated during myocardial ischemia, and angiotensin II is locally formed in ischemic hearts. At least four angiotensin II receptor subtypes have been identified, the AT1- and the AT2-receptor being the most prominent in the cardiovascular system. AT1-receptor blockade--like inhibition of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)--limits infarct size, improves functional recovery following myocardial ischemia and attenuates ventricular remodeling, post-myocardial infarction and the resulting development of heart failure. The potential mechanisms responsible for the cardioprotection by AT1-receptor blockade remain to be elucidated in detail, but appear to involve AT2-receptor activation and--like ACE-inhibitors--bradykinin and prostaglandins. Combined treatment with ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor blockers has the potential to further reduce infarct size and improve ventricular remodeling over each monotherapy alone.", 
    "395": "The clinical value of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) in heart failure has clearly been documented for the ACE-inhibitors as well as for the angiotensin-I-receptor blocker (AT1) by extensive intervention studies (AIRE, CONSENSUS, SAVE, ELITE II, ValHeFT and others). The additional specific vascular and renal protection, acting beyond the lowering of blood pressure, has been investigated in the past years in numerous studies in patients with arterial hypertension, often accompanied by diabetes mellitus type II. Whereas for nephroprotection, especially also in additionally present diabetes mellitus type II, study results clearly support the assumption of additional protective effects, which exceed the purely blood-pressure lowering effect; the data available for vascular protection (coronary and cerebral vessels) are insufficient.", 
    "396": "Angiotensin (Ang) II and endothelin (ET-1) can both be regulated by NF-kappaB. They are, to variable degrees, also capable of activating NF-kappaB and increase the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes. Ang II-related vascular effects are in part mediated by ET-1. Nitric oxide synthase inhibition facilitates Ang II-related effects, which can be inhibited both by AT1-receptor blockers and by endothelin system inhibitors. This state-of-affairs supports the notion that a combined therapeutic strategy of inhibiting Ang II and ET-1 generation or blocking their effects at the receptor level would be superior to either strategy alone. Animal studies are encouraging but not without conflicting results. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1-receptor blockers have a superb track record in experimental animal models and in a host of clinical studies. Selective and nonselective blockers of the ET-1 receptors are important research tools and are also undergoing clinical trials. Inhibitors of the endothelin-converting enzyme have been developed. The recent elucidation of the endothelin-converting enzyme's physical structure should facilitate the development of still more novel compounds to inhibit ET-1 generation. We have recently engendered supportive evidence in this regard.", 
    "397": "The prevalence of congestive heart failure (CHF) in the United States is approximately 4 million, with associated annual health care expenditures exceeding dollar 8 billion. Clinical pathways for CHF have been developed, but they have not been rigorously evaluated regarding efficacy and improvement in the quality of care. We sought to evaluate the effect of a CHF clinical pathway on hospital charges, length of stay, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with CHF in a retrospective cohort study.", 
    "398": "We studied 371 patients (age range, 44-92 yr) with discharge diagnoses of CHF in a 376-bed community hospital between July 1996 and December 1997. We conducted chart reviews to determine length of stay, hospital charges, and use of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "399": "Of the 371 patients, 174 were assigned to the clinical pathway and 197 were not. Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. The benchmark of less than 4 days' in-hospital stay was achieved in 65% of patients on the pathway and 42% who were not on the pathway (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-4.05; P < 0.001). The median hospital charges were lower in the group on the clinical pathway (dollar 3,000 versus dollar 5,500, P < 0.001). In addition, 81% of the patients on the clinical pathway were administered ACE inhibitors, compared with 48% of equally eligible patients from the nonpathway group (odds ratio, 4.68; 95% confidence interval, 2.85-7.72; P < 0.001).",

    "401": "The hypokinetic blood circulation was detected in 49% (from a total of 180) patients with different forms of pulmonary tuberculosis. Obvious initial signs of disorders in the function of the cardio-vascular system were diagnosed in one half of patients with the normal kinetic blood circulation. 48 patients underwent a preoperative treatment to correct the hemodynamic disorders. Isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg/day), verapamilhydrochlorid (240 mg/day), maleate enalapril (5 mg/day) and isosorbide dinirate (80 mg/day) were administered simultaneously. The preoperative preparation of patients lasted from 4 to 7 days. The cardiac beat, and the mechanical index of the functioning of the left ventricle essentially improved, while the total peripheral resistance significantly decreased due to all treatment schemes. Isosorbide dinitrate and verapamilhydrochlorid produced the most effect on the parameters of the central hemodynamics. The administration of all above preoperative preparation schemes in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis reduces the operation-anesthesiology risk.", 
    "402": "The frequency of arterial hypertension occurrence in polish population amounts to 30-40%, among diabetics is significantly higher-70%. According to the WHO/ISH Guidelines all hypertensive patients with diabetes are included into the \"high risk group\" independent of hypertension stage. Pharmacological treatment of hypertension is this group of patients has a particular meaning. Among hypertensive patients the degree of blood pressure lowering is more effective for cardiovascular risk reduction than choice of drug. This fact is well documented in clinical trials comparing antihypertensive efficacy of old and new antihypertensive drugs (for example UKPDS, STOP 2, INSIGHT). From the other point of view renal protection and metabolic benefits, as well as reduction of target organ damage are more advantageous for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and calcium antagonists than for diuretics and beta-blockers. Despite fast progress in clinical research on new antihypertensive drugs (especially AT1 receptor inhibitors) ACE-I seem to still remain still the \"first choice\" for hypertensive diabetics. Adequate blood pressure control among diabetic hypertensives is of special importance and usually needs appropriate combined antihypertensive therapy. Our review presents detailed information about treatment advantages and disadvantages of drugs from different antihypertensive classes in light of current clinical trials and international guidelines.", 
    "403": "The objective of this paper was to evaluate potential beneficial effects of combined treatment with slow-release nitrates and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) on left ventricular remodeling and exercise capacity in patients after acute myocardial infarction. In this study, 141 patients (aged 34 to 74, mean 56.6 years) with sufficient circulation received combined treatment with 24 hour nitroglycerin infusion followed by oral nitrates (isosorbide mononitrate 50 mg OD) from day 2 day 42 after myocardial infarction and ACE inhibitor (captopril 25 mg BID or enalapril 5 mg BID versus placebo) from day 10 to day 42. On days 10 and 42, echocardiographic examination was carried out and recorded on an optical disc. Simultaneously, on the same days, the treadmill exercise test (modified Bruce protocol) was performed. In the echocardiographic study the left ventricular endodiastolic and endosystolic volumes (biplane Simpson formula), ejection fraction, left ventricular wall motion score and left ventricular mass index were analyzed. Treadmill test criteria, used in the study, included exercise duration time and workload (METS). For each patient the data obtained examination II and I were measured and the differences in their values were classified. The obtained results were analyzed with one-way and three-way ANOVA test. A Kruskal-Wallis test was also used in one variable analysis. Results were analyzed after repartition of patients into groups according type of treatment (angiotensin converting ing enzyme inhibitor or placebo), infarct location (anterior or inferior wall) and enzyme level (CPK < 2000 IU/L or CPK > 2000 IU/L). A p value < 0.1 was considered statistically significant. In a single factor analysis ANOVA proved that the patients treated with nitrates and captopril showed greater improvement in exercise capacity (in METS) than patients treated with enalapril or placebo (+1.26 captopril, +0.2 enalapril and +0.29 placebo, p = 0.043). In addition, a decrease in left ventricular mass index was evident only in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (placebo +7.37 gm/m2, captopril -12.17 gm/m2, enalapril -10.14 gm/m2, p = 0.0032). The triple factor analysis ANOVA test revealed that the change in endodiastolic left ventricular volume depends on combination of three factors: infarct location, type of treatment and level of cardiac enzymes (p = 0.009). A decrease in left ventricular endodiastolic volume between day 42 and 10 was observed only in patients with inferior wall infarct and CPK level < 2000 IU/L, irrespective of treatment type and in patients with inferior wall infarct and CPK level > 2000 IU/L treated with angiotensin enzyme inhibitor. We noticed also that heart failure, considered as contraindication to randomization, was in addition the most frequent (up to day 10) cause for study termination and initiation of treatment with angiotensin enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "404": "Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions and an increasing proportion of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are diabetics. CAD in diabetics has specificities and, in particular, more extensive atherosclerosis; diabetic patients are also more frequently asymptomatic, with silent myocardial ischemia, which makes the diagnosis of CAD more difficult. In addition, diabetic patients with CAD have poorer outcomes than nondiabetics. The management of diabetic patients with CAD is based on intensive intervention on lifestyle and risk factors, together with the mandatory use of medications of proven benefit as regards secondary prevention in coronary patients: antiplatelet agents, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Glycemic control is also essential; although the use of sulfonylureas has been controversial, there is now a vast amount of data suggesting a beneficial effect, in particular when agents more specific for the pancreatic adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium (K(ATP)) channels are used. At the acute stage of myocardial infarction, the Diabetes mellitus, Insulin Glucose infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) trial suggested a beneficial effect of insulin therapy prolonged for 3 months after hospital discharge; these data will have to be confirmed by larger intervention trials. Finally, the respective roles of coronary angioplasty and coronary surgery in diabetics are debated; a post hoc analysis of the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI) trial data showed increased mortality in diabetics with multivessel CAD treated with angioplasty compared with surgery, but the results of the more recent trials using intracoronary stents appear more balanced; in this regard, the effects of drug-eluting stents, which dramatically decrease the incidence of re-stenosis, seem promising.", 
    "405": "Calcium channel blocker (CCB)-related edema is quite common in clinical practice and can effectively deter a clinician from continued prescription of these drugs. Its etiology relates to a decrease in arteriolar resistance that goes unmatched in the venous circulation. This disproportionate change in resistance increases hydrostatic pressures in the precapillary circulation and permits fluid shifts into the interstitial compartment. CCB-related edema is more common in women and relates to upright posture, age, and the choice and dose of the CCB. Once present it can be slow to resolve without intervention. A number of strategies exist to treat CCB-related edema, including switching CCB classes, reducing the dosage, and/or adding a known venodilator such as a nitrate, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or an angiotensin-receptor blocker to the treatment regimen. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been best studied in this regard. Diuretics may alter the edema state somewhat, but at the expense of further reducing plasma volume. Traditional measures such as limiting the amount of time that a patient is upright and/or considering use of graduated compression stockings are useful adjunctive therapies. Discontinuing the CCB and switching to an alternative antihypertensive therapy will resolve the edema.", 
    "406": "Clinical studies have detected an unexpected inhibition of diabetic retinopathy by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, but the mechanism for this action is unclear. In light of evidence indicating that the severity of hyperglycemia is a major initiating factor in the pathogenesis of the retinopathy, this study was conducted to examine the effect of ACE inhibitors on glucose accumulation in retinas of diabetic rats.", 
    "407": "Rats were made experimentally diabetic by injection of streptozotocin and treated with captopril (25 mg/kg body weight per day) or atenolol (10 mg/kg body weight per day) for 8 weeks. Bovine retinal endothelial cells were cultured in medium containing either 5.5 or 25 mM glucose and treated with different concentrations of captopril or lisinopril for 5 days. Glucose content in retinas and cultured cells was measured by spectrometry. Expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 in retinas and cultured cells was determined by Western blot analysis. Glucose uptake was performed by using 3-O-methyl-D-[(3)H] glucose.", 
    "408": "Treatment of rats with captopril inhibited the diabetes-induced accumulation of glucose in the retina by 48% (P < 0.01) compared with the diabetic control, but atenolol had no significant effect. Similarly, captopril and lisinopril significantly inhibited intracellular accumulation of glucose in primary bovine retinal endothelial cells cultured in an elevated glucose concentration. These data indicate that the captopril-induced inhibition of glucose accumulation observed in retinal tissue of diabetic rats was not due to reduction in blood pressure or in vascular permeability. Although it had no effect on the expression of the GLUT1 in retinas and cultured retinal endothelial cells, captopril at a concentration of 2 mM significantly inhibited the high-glucose-induced increase in GLUT1-mediated glucose transport in cultured retinal endothelial cells by 67% +/- 10%.", 
    "409": "Inhibition of glucose accumulation within retinal cells probably contributes at least in part to the observed inhibition of diabetic retinopathy by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "410": "Aldosterone has been implicated in the progression of heart failure. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) provided the first opportunity to examine the long-term effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker on plasma aldosterone levels in patients with NYHA class II through IV heart failure.", 
    "411": "Plasma aldosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay in core laboratories at baseline and during follow-up in patients assigned to valsartan at a target dose of 160 mg twice daily or placebo. In the placebo group, aldosterone (baseline, 150+/-160 pg/mL, mean+/-SD; n=2025) increased at 4, 12, and 24 months. In the valsartan group, aldosterone (baseline, 137+/-124 pg/mL, mean+/-SD; n=2023) decreased at 4 months and remained suppressed for up to 2 years. At end point (last measurement in each patient), mean aldosterone increased by 17.8+/-3.0 pg/mL (SEM) (11.9%) in the placebo group and decreased by 23.8+/-3.0 pg/mL (SEM) (-17.4%) in the valsartan group (P<0.00001). The effect of valsartan was similar in all subgroups, including those receiving neither ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) nor beta-blockers (BB) at baseline and those receiving concomitant ACE-I or BB. In contrast, outcome effects varied in the 4 subgroups, with a statistically significant reduction in the combined mortality/morbidity end point in those receiving neither neurohormonal inhibitor and an adverse trend in those treated with both drugs.", 
    "412": "Valsartan added to background therapy for heart failure produces sustained reduction in plasma aldosterone, consistent with the observed significant reduction in the combined mortality/morbidity end point. A similar reduction in all subgroups based on ACE-I or BB therapy, despite differing clinical outcomes in these subgroups, suggests that aldosterone plasma levels may not be a critical marker of the progression of heart failure.",

Using binary logistic regression, it was shown that the 50% of patients with more rapid RRF loss (< -0.05 mL/min/month/1.73 m2) were more likely to have had a higher initial RRF at commencement of PD [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.40] and a higher baseline dialysate/ plasma creatinine ratio at 4 hours (D/P creat; AOR 44.6, 95% CI 1.05-1900). On multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis, time from commencement of PD to development of anuria was independently predicted by baseline RRF [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.60-0.81], D/P creat (HR 2.87, 95% CI 2.06-82.3), body surface area (HR 6.23, 95% CI 1.53-25.5), dietary protein intake (HR 2.87, 95% CI 1.06-7.78), and diabetes mellitus (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.00-2.72). Decline of RRF was independent of age, gender, dialysis modality, urgency of initiation of dialysis, smoking, vascular disease, blood pressure, medications (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), duration of follow-up, and peritonitis rate.", 
    "419": "The results of this study suggest that high baseline RRF and high D/P creat ratio are risk factors for rapid loss of RRF. Moreover, a shorter time to the onset of anuria is independently predicted by low baseline RRF, increased body surface area, high dietary protein intake, and diabetes mellitus. Such at-risk patients should be closely monitored for early signs of inadequate dialysis.", 
    "420": "Angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, is mainly present in the vascular endothelium. Multiple studies have confirmed that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which block the formation of angiotensin II, lower blood pressure and also improve heart failure. These agents not only have beneficial hemodynamic effects but also bestow additional benefits on vascular function and prevent clinical cardiovascular events in patients at risk for coronary artery disease. These latter benefits may represent effects of ACE inhibitors on local endocrine pathways, inflammatory processes, and atherosclerosis taking place within the arterial wall. Current evidence suggests that, although ACE inhibitors may not substantially reverse atherosclerotic plaque already present, they may slow the progression of such atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, by modulating inflammatory pathways within and adjacent to the atherosclerotic lesion, they may stabilize an unstable plaque and therefore decrease the risk of plaque rupture and its complications.", 
    "421": "Prospective, randomised trials are the key to evidence-based medicine. They have brought considerable progress to the field of cardiology. They have, however, methodological constraints that result in the inclusion of only a small proportion of patients presenting with a given disease. In contrast, registries include all patients, without any selection, and therefore reflect everyday practice in the \"real world\". They are the key to epidemiological data, but they can also be used to tackle questions or issues that are unresolved by randomised trials. Both approaches are complementary and should be used to define the optimal management of patients. Lessons derived from registry data in acute coronary syndromes in the recent past in France are presented.",

Examples are taken mainly from the author's own experience and from among the named impurities in the European Pharmacopoeia with focus on impurities in hydrocortisone, prednisolone, enalapril maleate, lisinopril, ethynodiol diacetate, pipecuronium bromide, cimetidine, and ethynylsteroids. The methodological aspects of impurity profiling from the detection to the identification/structure elucidation and quantitative determination of impurities are briefly summarized.", 
    "423": "Mechanical forces including pressure and shear stress play an important role in vascular homeostasis via the control of the production and release of a variety of vasoactive factors. An increase in vascular shear stress is accompanied by nitric oxide (NO) release and NO synthase activation. Previously, we have demonstrated that shear stress induces angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) down-regulation in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we determined whether NO participates in the shear stress-induced ACE suppression response. Rabbit aortic endothelial cells were evaluated using the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME, and two NO donors, diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Under static conditions, incubation of endothelial cells with 1 mM L-NAME for 18 h increased ACE activity by 27% (from 1.000 +/- 0.090 to 1.272 +/- 0.182) while DEA/NO and SNP (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mM) caused no change in ACE activity. Interestingly, ACE activity was down-regulated similarly in the presence or absence of L-NAME (delta(0 mM) = 0.26 0.055, delta(0.1 mM) = 0.21 +/- 0.22, delta(1 mM) = 0.36 +/- 0.13) upon 18 h shear stress activation (from static to 15 dyn/cm2 ). Taken together, these results indicate that NO can participate in the maintenance of basal ACE levels in the static condition but NO is not associated with the shear stress-induced inactivation of ACE.", 
    "424": "Aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in combination to treat a wide spectrum of cardiac disorders. Theoretically, a rationale for interaction between these two agents exists in the possible counterbalancing prostaglandin inhibiting actions of aspirin and the vasodilatory prostaglandin promoting effects of ACE inhibitors. Animal and human studies suggest such an interaction, but most are plagued by small numbers or retrospective designs. Large-scale trials are in progress to address this issue. Until then, the key factor in deciding whether a patient with ischemic heart disease on ACE inhibitor therapy should be placed on aspirin therapy may largely depend on the severity of heart failure. The more severe the heart failure, the more likely an appreciable interaction between aspirin and ACE inhibitors will occur. Treatment with either low-dose aspirin or with alternative agents, such as warfarin or clopidogrel, may be the best therapeutic approach for patients with severe systolic heart failure.", 
    "425": "The medical management of heart failure has undergone remarkable progress in the past 10 years. The paradigm shift is toward long-term reparative strategies that help in altering the biologic properties of the failing heart. Together with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers have emerged as standard therapy for heart failure, especially for patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Since most of the clinical trials demonstrating the benefits of betablockers have been done in patients with mild to moderate heart failure, some controversy exists about the utility of beta-blocking agents in patients with advanced heart failure. This review will summarize the rationale and the use of beta blockers, a very challenging therapeutic strategy, in patients with severe heart failure.",

Hypertension is a predominant etiology for heart failure among African Americans with an aggressive incidence of end-organ damage. Despite the advances in treatment of heart failure with neurohormonal attenuation, there appears to be inconsistency in the response of African Americans compared to Caucasians. This discordance with regard to response to treatment and etiology of heart failure between African Americans and Caucasians begets the question whether heart failure in African Americans is indeed a distinct clinical entity.",

We reviewed charts for the 30 days following admission and assessed various therapeutic regimens used for heart failure as well as serum potassium and creatinine, before and after drug exposure. The primary end-point was the development of hyperkalaemia (K > or = 5.5 mEq/l).

It induces an increased synthesis of angiotensin II, endothelin and profibrogenic growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), by mesangial and tubular cells. The antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathies predicts long-term renoprotection afforded by these drugs.

There was no significant correlation between the level of baseline proteinuria and the proteinuria decrease induced by losartan. Both losartan and amlodipine induced a similar and significant blood pressure reduction. Target blood pressure was achieved with the initial dose of study medication (50 mg daily) in 76% of losartan group patients and in 68% of the amlodipine group patients (5 mg daily). Urinary TGF-beta significantly decreased with losartan (-22.4% of the baseline values after 20 weeks of treatment), whereas it tended to increase with amlodipine (between-group difference P < 0.05).

We have used the two-domain ACE form and its individual domains to compare characteristics of different domains and to probe mutual functioning of the two active sites within a bovine ACE molecule. The substrate Cbz-Phe-His-Leu (N-carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanyl-L-histidyl-L-leucine; from the panel of seven) was hydrolyzed faster by the N-domain, the substrates FA-Phe-Gly-Gly (N-(3-[2-furyl]acryloyl)-L-phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine) and Hip-His-Leu (N-benzoyl-glycyl-L-histidyl-L-leucine) were hydrolyzed by both domains with equal rates, while other substrates were preferentially hydrolyzed by the C-domain. The inhibitor captopril ((2S)-1-(3-mercapto-2-methylpropionyl)-L-proline) bound to the N-domain more effectively than to the C-domain, whereas lisinopril ((S)-N(alpha)-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline) bound to equal extent with all ACE forms. However, active site titration with lisinopril assayed by hydrolysis of FA-Phe-Gly-Gly revealed that 1 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme abolished the activity of either two-domain or single-domain ACE forms, indicating that a single active site functions in bovine somatic ACE. Neither of the k(cat) values obtained for somatic enzyme was the sum of k(cat) values for individual domains, but in every case the value of the catalytic constant of the hydrolysis of the substrate by the two-domain ACE represented the mean quantity of the values of the corresponding catalytic constants obtained for single-domain forms. The results indicate that the two active sites within bovine somatic ACE exhibit strong negative cooperativity.", 
    "436": "Pneumonia is a common cause of death in elderly people. A series of our studies have demonstrated that pneumonia in the elderly is characterized by silent aspiration, impaired swallowing and cough reflex, partly due to cerebral infarctions at basal ganglia. These infarctions probably induce the disruption of the specific central neurotransmitter system including dopamine and substance P, which plays an important role for swallowing and cough reflex. Use of ACE inhibitor and stimulation of the oral cavity by simple oral care, which are effective in increasing substance P. reduced the incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Moreover, use of a dopamine agonist such as amantadine hydrochloride and a folic acid supplement that are known to potentiate dopaminergic neurons also prevented aspiration pneumonia. For patients bedridden due to lowered ADL, it is essential for them to keep an upright position a few hours after meals to prevent aspiration pneumonia caused by the reflux of ingested foods. Also, administration of neuroleptics may cause aspiration pneumonia by suppression of dopaminergic neurons.",

    "447": "NK3201 is an orally active chymase inhibitor. Its inhibitory activity leads to formation of acyl-intermediate between active serine residue of the enzyme and di-ketone structure of NK3201. NK3201 inhibits human, dog and hamster chymases with IC(50) of 2.5, 1.2, and 28 nM, respectively. On the other hand, NK3201 does not inhibit other types of serine proteases, tryptase, thrombin, elastase, plasmin, and plasminogen activator. In dogs, at 8 h after oral administration of NK3201, 1 mg/kg, the drug levels in plasma, heart, and aorta reached 470, 195, and 78 nM, respectively. In a dog model NK3201, 5 mg/kg/day, increased chymase activity in grafted veins, and suppressed vascular proliferation. After balloon injury in dog vessels, chymase activity was increased locally, in the injured artery, and NK3201, 1 mg/kg/day was effective in preventing vascular proliferation. On the other hand, NK3201, unlike angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, did not affect blood pressure. These findings indicate that local angiotensin II production by chymase is involved only in vascular proliferation, as seen in the injured vessels. Therefore, NK3201 may be useful for preventing vascular proliferation without affecting blood pressure.", 
    "448": "Recent studies suggest that aldosterone may play a larger role than once appreciated in normal physiologic function and cardiovascular disease. Some of the adverse cardiovascular effects that have been described include cardiac and vascular fibrosis, vascular necrosis and inflammation, impaired endothelial function, reduced fibrinolysis, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), congestive heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. In light of these findings, the ability to block the actions of aldosterone has gained increased therapeutic importance. Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone receptor blocker that displays little interaction with androgen and progesterone receptors. Eplerenone has already been approved for the treatment of systemic hypertension and has been evaluated in numerous hypertension subgroups, including patients with low plasma renin activity; diabetes; LVH; uncontrolled blood pressure while receiving monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, or beta-blockers; and in black patients. Results of these trials indicate that eplerenone lowers blood pressure and reduces end-organ damage. Further proof of the therapeutic importance of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade comes from the eplerenone post acute myocardial infarction survival and efficacy study (EPHESUS). In this large-scale clinical outcome trial, eplerenone was shown to reduce total mortality by 15% as well as the combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality/cardiovascular hospitalization by 13% when administered at a mean of 7.3 days post myocardial infarction to patients with evidence of systolic left ventricular dysfunction and symptoms of heart failure. Eplerenone is well tolerated, with an adverse effect profile comparable to placebo. The advent of selective aldosterone blockers, such as eplerenone, should prove to be of great therapeutic value in hypertension control and prevention of cardiovascular disease and associated end-organ damage.",

    "453": "We reported that the initial beneficial effects of left ventricular repair (LVR) surgery for LV aneurysm after myocardial infarction (MI) did not persist because of postoperative LV remodeling in a rat model. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in postinfarction LV remodeling. Inhibition of RAS may be useful to preserve LV function by preventing remodeling. We studied the effects of two inhibitors of RAS in an attempt to improve the operative results of LVR. LV aneurysms were created in rats after ligating the left anterior descending artery. These rats underwent LVR by plicating the LV aneurysm and were treated by three methods: no treatment, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) (lisinopril 10 mg/kg per day), and treatment with angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (candesartan 5 mg/kg per day). One week after LVR, echocardiography revealed smaller LV size and better LV motion than before surgery. Four weeks after LVR, LV size returned to the preoperative value in the untreated group, but not as much in the treated groups. Cardiac catheterization revealed lower LV end-diastolic pressure and higher E-max in the treated groups. There was no difference between ACE-I and ARB groups except for systolic blood pressure. LVR decreased LV size and improved systolic function only in the early phase. Adjuvant therapy of ACE-I or ARB-attenuated LV remodeling and maintained LV function at the same level after LVR. This probably indicates that tissue RAS is associated with postoperative remodeling. Concomitant use of RAS inhibitors may make LVR a longer-lasting procedure for LV aneurysm.", 
    "454": "We review the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of myocardial disease associated with heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) and focus on the prevention of SCD in light of its structural pathways. Compared to patients without SCD, patients with SCD exhibit 5- to 6-fold increases in the risks of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. Epidemiologically, left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG or echocardiography acts as a potent dose-dependent SCD predictor. Dyslipidemia, a coronary disease risk factor, independently predicts echocardiographic hypertrophy. In adult SCD autopsy studies, increases in heart weight and severe coronary disease are constant findings, whereas rates of acute coronary thrombi vary remarkably. The microscopic myocardial anatomy of SCD is incompletely defined but may include prevalent changes of advanced myocardial disease, including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, fibroblast hyperplasia, diffuse and focal matrix protein accumulation, and recruitment of inflammatory cells. Hypertrophied cardiomyocytes express \"fetospecific\" genetic programs that can account for acquired long QT physiology with risk for polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias. Structural heart disease associated with HF and high SCD risk is causally related to an up-regulation of the adrenergic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. In outcome trials, suppression of this pathway with combinations of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers have achieved substantial total mortality and SCD reductions. Contrarily, trials with ion channel-active agents that are not known to reduce structural heart disease have failed to reduce these risks. Device therapy effectively prevents SCD, but whether biventricular pacing-induced remodeling decreases left ventricular mass remains uncertain.",

However, potent, selective, and, particularly, noncytotoxic inhibitors ot this protein are lacking, and the present work was undertaken with the aim of developing a new generation of noncytotoxic inhibitors that bind to APN/CD13. In this context, we have synthesized a series of novel flavone-8-acetic acid derivatives. Among the herein described and evaluated compounds, the 2',3-dinitroflavone-8-acetic acid (19b) proved to be the most efficient and exhibited an IC(50) of 25 microM which is 2.5 times higher than that of bestatin (1), the natural known inhibitor of APN/CD13.

The presence of other substituents such as NO(2) or OCH(3) groups at the 3'- or 4'-position of the B phenyl group, or the existence of steric constraints (compounds 24 and 29), did not improve selectivity and potency.

    "457": "The goal of antihypertensive treatment is to reduce both blood pressure and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There are currently six major classes of antihypertensive drugs that are available for the initial lowering and maintenance of blood pressure, including beta-blockers, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. All these classes of antihypertensive drugs are equally effective in reducing high blood pressure. To select the right antihypertensive drug, characteristics other than efficacy should be used to distinguish the different classes. According to the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, the selection of initial antihypertensive drug should consider patient risk-factor profile and co-morbidity, as well as the safety and tolerability profile of the drug. When these factors are considered, an effective and well-tolerated drug regimen can be tailored to an individual patient. An initial drug regimen should consist of a low dose of a long-acting, once-daily drug that is titrated upward if blood pressure is not adequately controlled. Low-dose combinations of two antihypertensive drugs may also be considered. Results from comparative studies with different classes of antihypertensive drugs suggest that different populations of patients, such as those with diabetes, left-ventricular dysfunction, or lipid disorders, may benefit from taking different antihypertensive drugs.",

Recent outcome trials have examined the benefits associated with different levels of blood pressure control or have compared several of the 'newer' classes of antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, with 'older' drug classes, such as diuretics and beta-blockers. Other trials have compared antihypertensive drugs with placebo. We performed a meta-regression analysis of 30 clinical trials that included a total of 149,407 patients. We based our analysis on summary statistics reported in the literature, and showed that blood pressure gradients accounted for most, if not all, of the differences in outcome in patients with hypertension or at high cardiovascular risk. We also conducted a study in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension and showed that antihypertensive drug treatment starting with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, nitrendipine, reduced the risk of stroke and all cardiovascular complications. In addition, nitrendipine-based blood pressure-lowering therapy decreased the incidence of dementia. In diabetic patients, nitrendipine reduced the risk of proteinuria, decreased total mortality, and markedly improved cardiovascular prognosis. Taken together, these findings emphasize the desirability of tight blood pressure control.",

    "468": "Essential hypertension is a very heterogeneous disease and different pressor mechanisms might interact to increase blood pressure. It is therefore not surprising that antihypertensive drugs given as monotherapies normalize blood pressure in only a proportion of hypertensive patients. This is, for instance, the case for diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists administered as single agents. The rationale for combining antihypertensive agents relates in part to the concept that the blood pressure-decreasing effect may be enhanced when two classes are coadministered. Also, combination treatment serves to counteract the counter-regulatory mechanisms that are triggered whenever pharmacologic intervention is initiated and act to limit the efficacy of the antihypertensive medication. For example, the compensatory increase in renin secretion induced by sodium depletion may become the predominant factor sustaining high blood pressure. Simultaneous blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, with either an ACE inhibitor or an AT1 receptor blocker, makes this compensatory hyper-reninaemia ineffective and allows maximum benefit from sodium depletion. The increased effectiveness obtained by combining a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system with a low dose of a diuretic is not obtained at the expense of reduced tolerability compared with the individual components administered alone. Fixed very-low-dose combinations containing an ACE inhibitor or an AT1 receptor blocker and a diuretic are therefore likely to become increasingly used, not only as second-line therapy, but also as first-line treatment. This is the case, for instance, for the fixed very-low-dose combination of the ACE inhibitor perindopril (2 mg) and the diuretic indapamide (0.625 mg), as this preparation is very effective in decreasing blood pressure while maintaining a tolerability that is similar to that of placebo.", 
    "469": "The present study examined the role of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in mediating the pressor and renal sympathetic baroreflex effects of intraventricularly administered angiotensin II (Ang II) in urethane anaesthetised rabbits. Microinjection of Ang II over a wide range of medullary sites showed that pressor responses were observed only in the RVLM. Ang II was particularly potent in producing a transient pressor response at this site with a half maximal dose of 9 fmol. The administration of the Ang II antagonist Sar(1)-Ile(8)-Ang II (10 pmol) bilaterally into the RVLM inhibited the pressor response to local and fourth ventricular Ang II, but not the pressor response to RVLM applied glutamate. To determine the contribution of the RVLM to the renal sympathetic baroreflex effects of Ang II, blood pressure-renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) curves were constructed with intravenous infusion of phenylephrine or nitroprusside before and after Ang II, vehicle or glutamate infusions into the RVLM. Ang II infusion of 4 pmol/min into the RVLM increased blood pressure by 8+/-3 mm Hg and shifted the renal sympathetic baroreflex curve to the right. The maximum RSNA evoked by lowering blood pressure increased by 36+/-6%, similar to the effect seen with fourth ventricular Ang II and RVLM glutamate. These studies suggest that the major medullary pressor site of action of Ang II when injected into the hindbrain cerebro-spinal fluid of anaesthetized rabbits is the RVLM where it facilitates baroreflex control of RSNA.", 
    "470": "The MARCH-INSIDE methodology has been generalized, by means of an exponential central symmetry factor, to codify chemical structure information for chiral drugs. In order to test the potential of this novel approach in drug design we have modeled the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of perindoprilate's sigma-stereoisomer combinatorial library. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model classifies correctly 83.33% of active compounds and 94.12% of non-active ones in a training set, results that represent a total of 91.3% accuracy in classification. On the other hand, the model classifies 83.33% of these compounds in the predicting series. Only three isomers (those with higher activity) were used in the predicting set and the model classified all three very well. Similar predictive behavior was observed in a leave-1-out cross validation experiment. Canonical regression analysis corroborated the statistical quality of the models (Rcanc=0.79, with a P-level<0.000) and was also used to compute biological activity canonical scores for each compound. Finally, prediction of the biological activities of chiral 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines, which are sigma-receptor antagonists, by linear regression analysis was carried out. The model was statistically significant (R=0.963, S=0.29, P<0.00) and can be considered as a preliminary comparative study between MARCH-INSIDE and Chiral Topologic descriptors. Application of the Student test permits the detection of non-symmetric properties within the data set and justified the requirement of non-symmetric (for pairs of enantiomers) molecular descriptors.

The ACE genotype was not associated with the long-term risks of stroke, cardiac events, mortality, dementia, or cognitive decline; neither did the ACE genotype predict the blood pressure reduction associated with the use of the ACE inhibitor perindopril. Similarly, there was no evidence that the ACE genotype modified the relative benefits of ACE inhibitor-based therapy over placebo.

    "481": "The atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) plays an important role in chronic heart failure (CHF), delaying the progression of the disease. However, despite high ANP levels, natriuresis falls when CHF progresses from a compensated to a decompensated state, suggesting emergence of renal resistance to ANP. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain renal hyporesponsiveness, including decreased renal ANP availability, down-regulation of natriuretic peptide receptors and altered ANP intracellular transduction signal. It has been demonstrated that the activity of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is increased in CHF, and that its inhibition enhances renal cGMP production and renal sodium excretion. In vitro as well as in vivo studies have provided strong evidence of an increased degradation of intracellular cGMP by phosphodiesterase in CHF. In experimental models, ANP-dependent natriuresis is improved by phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which may arise as new therapeutic agents in CHF. Sodium-retaining systems likely contribute to renal hyporesponsiveness to ANP through different mechanisms. Among these systems, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has received particular attention, as angiotensin II and ANP have renal actions at the same sites and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin-receptor blockade improve ANP hyporesponsiveness. Less is known about the interactions between the sympathetic nervous system, endothelin or vasopressin and ANP, which may also blunt ANP-induced natriuresis. To summarize, renal hyporesponsiveness to ANP is probably multifactorial. New treatments designed to restore renal ANP efficiency should limit sodium retention in CHF patients and thus delay the progression to overt heart failure.",

Until recently, it was thought that once a patient developed overt proteinuria, diabetic nephropathy was irreversible and inevitably progressed to ESRD. However, the reversal of lesions caused by diabetic nephropathy (e.g., glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial matrix increase) has been demonstrated in a series of patients who underwent a pancreas transplantation 10 years prior to the reversal. Remission of nephrotic range proteinuria has also been reported in some patients with type 1 diabetes from the Collaborative Study Group during a median follow-up of 3 years of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor administration; no deterioration of renal function was observed in these patients. Remission and regression in nephropathy of type 1 diabetes patients have also been reported when blood pressure was controlled aggressively. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) preserved renal function and slowed the progression of nephropathy to ESRD in patients with type 2 diabetes. Since many patients with type 2 diabetes manifest with a metabolic syndrome, multifactorial intensive treatment is necessary; such treatment includes behavior modifications, dietary intervention, exercise, and smoking cessation. In this population, pharmacological therapy targeting hyperglycemia, hypertension (including ARB/ACE inhibitor), and hyperlipidemia in cases of type 2 diabetes is also necessary.",

Patients were divided into 3 groups, each was treated during 8 weeks with one drug: gr 1--trandolapril (T), gr 2--felodipine ER (F), gr 3--rilmenidine (R). Glucose and insulin in oral glucose tolerance test, I/G proportion, serum lipids and uric acid were tested before and after therapy. The therapy did not influence lipid parameters: LDL, HDL, triglyceride. In the T group there could be observed a significant reduction of total cholesterol value. Examined drugs did not induce changes in serum carbohydrate. The significant reduction of serum uric acid could be observed only after F therapy. Analysed drugs are very useful in therapy of hypertension with metabolic disorders.", 
    "484": "Membranous nephropathy (MN) is not a common pediatric glomerular disease and not a common cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) in children. Because of the rarity of the disease, there is only a limited amount of uncontrolled data and no controlled data available in children regarding the treatment of MN. Older uncontrolled data indicate that nearly a quarter of children with NS, whether untreated or treated with various immunosuppressive agents, develop chronic renal failure. Current recommendations for treatment both for children presenting with or without NS therefore are based on controlled data obtained in adults with MN. All children should receive angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). Children with NS may be treated initially with corticosteroids. If a satisfactory response is not obtained with corticosteroids, then treatment with cyclosporine or chlorambucil can be tried. The protocols of treatment with these drugs are described in this article.", 
    "485": "Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) has a variable rate of progression to end-stage renal failure, with a significant number of patients going into spontaneous remission without therapy. For those who have persistent nephrotic proteinuria or manifest deterioration of renal function, steroids and immunosuppressive drugs are used. However, their long-term efficacy is challenged by a meta-analysis presented here. A different approach to reduction of proteinuria, a recognized progression promoter, is based on the notion that angiotensin II inhibition controls proteinuria and slows progression. Further, a more complex approach is required than simple administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor: a multidrug approach to remission of nephrotic syndrome therefore is described here.",

We hypothesize that increased nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in the brain compensates for hypertension. Therefore, we measured NOS activity in different brain regions in SHR at prehypertensive, onset and established hypertension, and compared with age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats.",

At established hypertension, SHR showed an augmentation in NOS activity in hypothalamus and brainstem. Chronic treatment of SHR with the angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor, enalapril, and the AT(1) receptor antagonist, losartan, normalized NOS activity in the hypothalamus but not in the brainstem. Treatment with a peripheral vasodilator, hydralazine, did not affect NOS activity.", 
    "493": "Attenuated NOS activity in the cortex and brainstem of prehypertensive SHR may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The upregulated NOS activity in the hypothalamus and brainstem of SHR possibly serves to compensate for hypertension. Hypothalamic, but not brainstem, NO is involved in antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibition and AT(1) receptor blockade. Since a blood pressure decrease per se had no effect on NOS activity, it appears that central sympathetic activity influenced by endogenous angiotensin II, rather than blood pressure, represents the stimulus for the increased NOS activity in the hypothalamus of SHR.", 
    "494": "We reviewed the drug treatment of hypertension in the light of recent trials. beta-Blockers and diuretics clearly reduce mortality, strokes, and coronary heart disease (CHD) in hypertension. Recent trials assessed whether newer agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or calcium blockers, offer any additional advantage, or have benefits in high-risk individuals with conventionally 'normal' blood pressure. The recent ALLHAT study claimed no differences in CHD or mortality when chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril were compared. However, the decrease in blood pressure was not the same with the three agents, and a substantial proportion of patients enrolled did not have clinical disease. In contrast, the LIFE study (comparing losartan and a beta-blocker) and the ANBP-2 study [comparing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and a diuretic] reduced blood pressure similarly, yet demonstrated benefits in favour of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors. Other trials indicated similar advantages of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Among high-risk patients with initial blood pressure in the 'normal' range, ACE inhibitors significantly reduce clinical events (mortality, strokes, and myocardial infarction), despite modest decreases in blood pressure, suggesting that additional mechanisms are responsible. Recent results of the Prospective Studies Collaboration show lower risk, even in the normal blood pressure range; high-risk patients will benefit further from ACE inhibitors and ARBs (and beta-blockers after myocardial infarction). Data for other blood pressure decreasing agents are unavailable in such populations. We conclude that blood pressure decreasing per se is of clinical benefit, but drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system offer additional advantages. Drug choice is best determined by the patient's clinical condition.", 
    "495": "A major drawback of subunit vaccines is their inability to generate cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL), a deficit attributed to segregation of the class I and class II antigen-processing pathways. We sought to understand processes involved in CTL induction by three proprietary adjuvants: Tomatine, PROVAX, and a synthesized glycolipid (Glc-N-(8/16), Glycolipid). We used in vivo models to investigate antigen uptake, macrophage involvement, TAP-independent processing, and costimulatory molecule dependencies. Glycolipid required splenic and lymph node macrophages, whereas Tomatine generated CTL independently of either macrophage population. In contrast, PROVAX showed partial macrophage requirements. Immunized TAP knockout mice revealed that ovalbumin (OVA)-Tomatine and OVA-PROVAX, but not OVA-Glycolipid, generate class I-peptide complexes. All three immunostimulants also elicited CD86-dependent TH1 cytokine responses.", 
    "496": "Studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough have involved extensive use of experimental models in which guinea pigs are exposed to an inhaled stimulus such as capsaicin or citric acid. In the present study, we examined enalapril-induced potentiation of spontaneous cough in guinea pigs, without an inhaled stimulus. Daily oral administration of enalapril (3 mg/kg) for 20 to 30 days enhanced spontaneous cough. This enhancement of cough was inhibited by the bradykinin B(1) receptor antagonist des-Arg(10)-[Leu(9)]kallidin, but not by the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist icatibant. The amount of the bradykinin B(1) receptor agonist [3H]des-Arg(10)-kallidin specifically bound to membrane fractions from the trachea and larynx was increased by prolongation of the enalapril treatment, and positively correlated well with coughing frequency. In conclusion, the present results indicate that enalapril-induced cough is mediated by up-regulation of bradykinin B(1) receptors.",

The aim of this study was to examine the implementation of a heart failure guideline among cardiologist and non-cardiologist physicians in a university hospital setting. Case record data were examined from 400 patients with a primary diagnosis of CHF. Management of these patients was assessed using a systolic heart failure guideline (Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network, number 35) as a benchmark. Hospital admission data were examined contemporaneously over a 17-month period to assess associations between adherence to drug therapies and number of admissions. Overall, there was poor adherence to the guideline, with relatively high use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (80%), low use of beta-blockers (32%) and digoxin (36%), and very low use of spironolactone (13%). Cardiologists used more beta-blockers (37 vs. 21%, P=0.003) and digoxin in sinus rhythm (18 vs. 5%, P<0.001) than non-cardiologists. Hospital admission rate was individually associated with increasing age, NYHA status, beta-blocker, diuretic and spironolactone prescription (all P<0.001). At multivariable analysis, only age, NYHA status and increased diuretic prescription were associated with more frequent admission (P<0.001, R(2)=0.15).

The primary endpoint was reduction in proteinuria during therapy. The study had two 8-week on-drug arms, with a 4-week washout period between. Baseline proteinuria was similar, enalapril 87 mg/m(2) per hour and losartan 77 mg/m(2) per hour. The mean reduction in proteinuria with enalapril was 48% (37%-57%) with a standard error of the mean of 3%; with losartan it was 31% (14%-52%) with a standard error of the mean of 7%. Although there was a significant reduction in proteinuria with the use of both drugs, the difference in reduction of proteinuria, 48% versus 31%, was not considered clinically significant. Potassium remained below 4.5 mmol/l in all patients. No patient's creatinine rose more than the standard deviation of our assay. Blood pressure (BP) control was acceptable in four of the six patients; two patients had persistently elevated or increased BP on each drug. Side effects were minimal; none requiring withdrawal, one requiring dose reduction. Studies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can reduce proteinuria in children with renal disorders. No studies to date have examined the reduction of proteinuria achieved by angiotensin receptor blockers. Our study, although small, suggests that angiotensin receptor blockers may reduce proteinuria as effectively, and as safely, as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.",

In the COPERNICUS study, the previously reported benefits of the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker carvedilol regarding morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure were also found in patients with severe heart failure. Carvedilol not only improves survival but when given in addition to conventional therapy, ameliorates the severity of heart failure and reduces the risk of clinical deterioration, hospitalisation and other serious adverse events. The diagnostic value of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients with congestive heart failure has been a topic of study for the past five years. Many questions still need to be answered but the results of a study by Maisel et al. show that BNP is not only of diagnostic value but is also important for prognosis and evaluation of therapy. A substudy of the Val-HeFT study focussed on the effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan on BPN and noradrenaline levels. Valsartan significantly reduced the combined endpoint of mortality and morbidity and improved clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, if added to prescribed therapy. However, in a post-hoc observation an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity was seen in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker, which raised concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.

Specific antihypertensive drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor blockers may be especially protective against stroke. Secondary stroke prevention in patients who have already had a stroke or transient ischemic attack is even more effective in preventing more serious strokes. Measures include antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering agents, carotid endarterectomy, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and other cardiac sources of embolic stroke, and antiplatelet therapy.

In Fischer rats at 4, 14, and 23 mo of age, we examined cardiac function using echocardiography, the regulation of cardiac O2 consumption in vitro, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein levels, and potential mechanisms that regulate superoxide. Aging was associated with a reduced ejection fraction [from 75 +/- 2% at 4 mo to 66 +/- 3% (P < 0.05) at 23 mo] and an increased cardiac diastolic volume [from 0.60 +/- 0.04 to 1.00 +/- 0.10 ml (P < 0.01)] and heart weight (from 0.70 +/- 0.02 to 0.90 +/- 0.02 g). The NO-mediated control of cardiac O2 consumption by bradykinin or enalaprilat was not different between 4 mo (36 +/- 2 or 34 +/- 3%) and 14 mo (29 +/- 1 or 25 +/- 3%) but markedly (P < 0.05) reduced in 23-mo-old Fischer rats (15 +/- 3 or 7 +/- 2%). The response to the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine was not different across groups (35%, 35%, and 44%). Interestingly, the eNOS protein level was not different at 4, 14, and 23 mo. The addition of tempol (1 mmol/l) to the tissue bath eliminated the depression in the control of cardiac O2 consumption by bradykinin (25 +/- 3%) or enalaprilat (28 +/- 3%) in 23-mo-old Fischer rats. We next examined the levels of enzymes involved in the production and breakdown of superoxide. The expression of Mn SOD, Cu/Zn SOD, extracellular SOD, and p67phox, however, did not differ between 4- and 23-mo-old rats. Importantly, there was a marked increase in gp91phox, and apocynin restored the defect in NO-dependent control of cardiac O2 consumption at 23 mo to that seen in 4-mo-old rats, identifying the role of NADPH oxidase. Thus increased biological activity of superoxide and not decreases in the enzyme that produces NO are responsible for the altered control of cardiac O2 consumption by NO in 23-mo-old Fischer rats. Increased oxidant stress in aging, by decreasing NO bioavailability, may contribute not only to changes in myocardial function but also to altered regulation of vascular tone and the progression of cardiac or vascular disease.",

A new X-ray crystallographic structure of the key catalytic domain of ACE provides detailed information about the structure of its active site, located in a deep channel, and its interactions with an inhibitor. Such information might facilitate the rational design of ACE inhibitors that are more potent and more selective and therefore of clinical use.", 
    "548": "We tested the hypothesis that in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) NO produced centrally influences the resting arterial blood pressure by attenuating mechanisms involving prostaglandins, angiotensin II, endothelin and sympathetic nervous system. L-NAME (200 micro g/5 micro l), an inhibitor of NO synthase, administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) to awake and freely moving rats increased mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in a biphasic pattern: an early transient increase within 1 min and a late prolonged response starting at 45 min and persisting for the duration of experiment (180 min). The two pressor responses involve different neurochemical mechanisms and, based on their latencies, they appear to reflect different anatomical sites of action of L-NAME. The late, but not the early pressor response, was prevented by pretreatment with chlorisondamine (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.), a ganglionic blocker, indicating its dependence on the sympathetic nervous system. Both pressor responses were abolished by i.c.v. pretreatment with indomethacin (200 micro g/5 micro l, i.c.v.), an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, showing that they are mediated by prostaglandin(s). In contrast, losartan (25 micro g/5 micro l), an angiotensin II AT(1) receptor antagonist, had no effect. The initial pressor response was also attenuated by pretreatment with the endothelin ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonist, PD 145065 (48 micro g/2 micro l, i.c.v.). Intravenous pretreatment with another ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonist, L-754,142 (15 mg/kg as a bolus+15 mg/kg/h for 180 min), however, attenuated both responses to L-NAME. It is possible that L-754,142 crossed the blood-brain barrier and blocked, in addition, central ET(A)/ET(B) receptors. These studies show that NO synthesized in the brain attenuates pressor mechanisms involving prostaglandin, endothelin and sympathetic nervous system, but not angiotensin II, to modulate resting arterial blood pressure.",

This study sought to explore the effect of additional beta blockade on neurohumoral modulation in patients with severe heart failure (HF) who received ACE inhibitors. Forty-nine patients with chronic HF who received ACE inhibitors were given metoprolol 50 mg or carvedilol 25 mg twice daily after a 4-week dose titration period in addition to standard therapy in a prospective trial. Samples of plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, aminoterminal B-type natriuretic peptide (N-BNP), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were taken at baseline and at 4, 12, and 52 weeks after starting therapy. Treatment with either beta blocker significantly lowered PRA at 4 weeks compared with baseline (-2.0 +/- 0.6 nmol/L/hour, p = 0.006), but at 12 weeks, PRA had reduced to -1.1 +/- 0.6 nmol/L/hour (p = 0.08), but at 52 weeks, it was not significantly different from baseline (+1.05 +/- 0.6 nmol/L/hour, p = 0.13). Aldosterone levels did not change significantly from baseline at 4 or 12 weeks, although there was a nonsignificant trend for lower levels at 52 weeks (baseline 232 +/- 154 pmol/L, 52 weeks 192 +/- 100 pmol/L, p = 0.09). There was significant reduction in N-BNP and ANP together with an improvement in symptom and left ventricular systolic function at 1-year follow-up. These results indicate that the suppressive effect of beta blockers on PRA in patients with HF taking ACE inhibitors is temporary, and that there is no significant effect on serum aldosterone levels.", 
    "550": "Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive defect in transepithelial transport of dibasic amino acids (e.g. cystine) which involves the proximal canaliculi, small intestine and central nervous system. It is the least common cause of nephrolithiasis, accounting for 1 to 3% of renal calculi. The natural course of the disease, characterised by recurrent stone formation, can frequently lead to renal failure, if left untreated. Until recently, treatment of cystinuria has been limited to symptomatic management including intensive hydration and urine alkalinisation. Different drugs that react with cystine to form soluble complexes have been used but their efficacy remains questionable. We present the case of a 6-year-old boy with severe, recurrent cystine urolithiasis treated with captopril. The diagnosis of cystine urolithiasis was established after a 3-year course of clinically apparent nephrolithiasis, characterised by stone passage. At the age of 5 years he underwent lithotripsy and nephrolithotomy for removal of staghorn calculi. Since then treatment with citrate and magnesium supplementation combined with captopril was introduced. After a follow-up of 12 months the patient remained stone-free. Urinary cystine decreased from 230 to 136 mg per gram creatinine. We conclude that captopril can be useful in the treatment of cystine urolithiasis in children.",

The actions of glutamate into the RVLM were tested, injecting glutamate (0.1 mol/L, 100 nL) and its antagonist kynurenic acid (0.02 mol/L, 100 nL). Glycine (0.5 mol/L, 100 nL) was also microinjected. Experiments were performed in male Wistar rats (weight, 250 to 300 g); 5 groups were studied: (1) 2K-1C nontreated (H, n=6); (2) 2K-1C treated with captopril, 10 mg/kg per day (Ht10, n=10); (3) 2K-1C treated with captopril, 50 mg/kg per day (Ht50, n=7); (4) control normotensive rats (N, n=7); and (5) normotensive rats treated with captopril, 50 mg/kg per day (Nt50, n=8). All experiments in 2K-1C were performed 6 weeks after renal surgery; captopril treatment lasted for the last 2 weeks. In urethane-anesthetized rats (1.2 g/kg IV), bilateral microinjection of glycine into the RVLM caused a depressor response; there was no difference between groups in relation to the change of variation (N: 54+/-2; H: 46+/-12; Ht10: 50+/-3, and Ht50: 42+/-7 mm Hg). Only in the H group, kynurenic acid microinjection into the RVLM caused a depressor response (H: 158+/-8 to 132+/-8 mm Hg). Glutamate response was larger in hypertensive than in normotensive rats (N: 38+/-2.6 and H: 55+/-6); no difference was observed between hypertensive groups. The data suggest that glutamate acts tonically to drive the RVLM in 2K-1C rats, and this action is modulated by endogenous angiotensin II. The increase in the glutamate actions within the RVLM may contribute to the pathogenesis of renovascular hypertension.",

The objectives of the present study were to determine in previously untreated essential hypertensive patients whether carotid IMT was associated with the M235T polymorphism, and to determine whether the M235T polymorphism could influence the reduction of carotid IMT by antihypertensive treatment. Common carotid artery IMT was determined with a high-definition echotracking system in 98 previously untreated hypertensive patients in a cross-sectional study. A subgroup of 56 patients was included in a randomized double-blind parallel group study comparing the effect of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitor enalapril with that of the beta-blocker celiprolol during a 5 month period. In the cross-sectional study, a multivariate analysis showed that the M235T genotype was a significant independent determinant of carotid IMT, explaining 7% of the variance. Carotid IMT was higher in patients homozygous for the T allele than in MM patients. In the longitudinal study, the reduction in carotid IMT after antihypertensive treatment was significantly ( P <0.01) higher in patients carrying the TT genotype than in patients carrying the MM genotype, despite similar reductions in blood pressure and independently of drug type. In conclusion, these data suggest that the angiotensinogen TT genotype at position 235 is a genetic marker for early carotid atherosclerosis in a hypertensive population and its regression under antihypertensive treatment.",

Based on the results of multiple randomized trials we can influence in both pharmacological and non-pharmacological way the major risk factors of stroke. Effective antihypertensive treatment, cholesterol lowering therapy, smoking cessation and antithrombotic treatment in subjects with atrial fibrillation result in noticeable reduction of stroke events in both primary and secondary prevention. The number of researches which aim the dementia prevention is still sparse, which makes the results of the recently presented PROGRESS trial even more interesting and valuable. It showed that it was possible to prevent dementia and cognitive impairment with therapy based on the long acting ACE inhibitor.

In the stage of renal insufficiency it is 60% and in conservatively terminal renal failure it is as high as 90%. After the initiation of dialyzation treatment it declines temporarily, it is higher during chronic haemodialysis (50-80%) and lower in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (30%). After transplantation it is recorded in 70-80% recipients of a renal graft. Among the causes of renal hypertension in subjects with conservatively treated chronic renal insufficiency at present secondary renal impairment is increasing--in type 2 diabetes and also renal vascular affection due to atherosclerotic changes and essential arterial hypertension. Approximately 30% of patients where chronic dialyzation treatment is started, come \"from the street\". In the pathogenesis of renal hypertension sodium retention is involved with volume expansion and an impaired ratio of the formation of vasoactive (vasopressor and vasodepressor) substances. In chronic renal failure the volume component of hypertension predominates markedly. The causes of the development of hypertension after renal transplantation are multifactorial and are most closely associated with immunosuppressive treatment and graft rejection. Pharmacological treatment of renal hypertension prefers inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (possibly angiotensin II antagonists) because of their concurrent renoprotective action. In the stage of renal insufficiency they call for reduced doses and combination with other antihypertensive agents. The objective of treatment is to achieve a blood pressure < 130/80 mm Hg. In chronic dialyzation treatment the main therapeutic provision in hypertension is adjustment of the volume of extracellular fluid by regime provisions and effective haemoelimination treatment. Calcium blockers are useful in particular in the treatment of hypertension in haemodialyzed subjects and in hypertension after renal transplantation.", 
    "577": "Patients with chronic renal failure have, as compared with age-matched controls with normal renal function, a markedly higher cardiovascular mortality. The reason is probably accelerated atherosclerosis and left ventricular hypertrophy as a result of accumulation of \"classical\" cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of some risk factors relatively specific for \"uraemia\" (e.g. anaemia, hyperhydratation, dyslipidaemia). It is assumed that the reversibility of left ventricular hypertrophy is limited in chronic renal failure due to more marked myocardial fibrosis (\"uraemic cardiomyopathy\"). Its regression can be achieved by treatment of hypertension with inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme with a positive effect on cardiovascular mortality. Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy occurs also in some patients after renal transplantation. Treatment of anaemia reduces the risk of progressive left ventricular dilatation. The cardiovascular risk increases probably already a relatively slight decline of glomerular filtration which need not lead to a significant rise of serum creatinine. The cardiovascular risk obviously increases further with progression of chronic renal insufficiency. Patients with a reduced renal function and chronic renal insufficiency have lower target blood pressure and should have also lower target values e.g. of serum cholesterol. Therapeutic procedures in these patients should not be focused only on a slower progression of chronic renal insufficiency but also on reduction of their high cardiovascular risk.",

To test this hypothesis, rats were chronically instrumented to continuously measure cardiac output (CO) and arterial pressure (AP). A venous catheter was implanted for infusion of saline vehicle (Veh; n = 8) or treatment [enalapril (2 mg.kg-1.day-1) plus ANG II: ANG-NORM (5 ng.kg-1.min-1 ANG II, n = 8) or ANG-HI (10 ng.kg-1.min-1 ANG II, n = 9)] to pharmacologically clamp plasma ANG II. After a 10-day recovery period on a 0.1% NaCl diet, AP and CO were measured continuously for 5 days of control (0.1% NaCl), 7 days of high salt (4.0% NaCl), and 5 days of recovery (0.1% NaCl). Hemodynamics did not change in the Veh group at any time. AP increased by approximately 20 mmHg in the ANG-NORM and ANG-HI groups when NaCl was increased. Hypertension was mediated by an increase in CO of approximately 12% at steady state, with no change in total peripheral resistance (TPR) during the high salt period. AP returned to control levels when dietary sodium was decreased, mediated by a approximately 10% decrease in TPR, with CO remaining elevated. There was no difference in the hemodynamic responses to increased salt between the ANG-HI and ANG-NORM groups. We conclude that the whole body autoregulation hypothesis does not explain the hemodynamic profile of salt-dependent hypertension in rats with an unresponsive renin-angiotensin system.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of renin-anigiotensin system blockage, either by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockage, on oxidative stress and nitric oxide release in diabetic rat kidneys. After induction of diabetes, six rats were given captopril, six rats were given losartan, and six rats served as diabetic controls. Six healthy rats were also included. At the end of an 8-week period nitric oxide release, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were measured in kidney cortices, and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was determined in 24-h urine samples. Losartan- and captopril-treated diabetic rats had lower levels of UAE than diabetic controls. Diabetic rats had higher levels of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation compared to healthy rats. NO release was significantly lower in diabetic groups than healthy controls. UAE levels showed a positive correlation with lipid peroxidation and a negative correlation with NO release. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation could be one of the protective mechanisms of renin-angiotensin axis inhibition in diabetic kidney tissues.",

LV weight and chamber size were significantly increased and percent fractional shortening (%FS) was decreased in untreated MI rats compared with normal control animals both at 4 and 12 weeks after MI. Animals with MI and treated with the ACE inhibitor temocapril showed significantly reduced LV weight and chamber size and increased %FS compared with untreated MI rats at 12 weeks after MI, but not at 4 weeks after MI. At 4 weeks after MI, no significant changes were found in the total creatine and relative distribution of each CK isoenzyme in either the temocapril-treated or untreated animals with MI compared with the normal controls. In contrast, at 12 weeks after MI, untreated MI rats showed significant reductions in the total creatine and mitochondrial and MM-CK fractions and increases in the MB- and BB-CK fractions compared with the controls. The alterations in the mitochondrial and MB-CK fractions were significantly attenuated after 12 weeks of ACE inhibition. Thus, LV myocardial energy metabolism is progressively impaired and its alteration is not related to the magnitude of geometric changes and LV dysfunction after MI. Most of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition were observed at 12 weeks after MI. Our results may provide an insight into the therapeutic strategy of ACE inhibition in chronic heart failure after MI.",

    "587": "A total of 162 transplant recipients were included in the study. The patients were randomized into 3 groups: group 1 received losartan; group II received an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), and group III received a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). All the parameters were recorded at the time of therapy initiation and at 1, 4 and 12 weeks and 12 months thereafter. Graft biopsy before the start and at the end of the study was done to evaluate histopathological progression.",

Treatment with losartan significantly decreased the plasma level of TGF-beta1, 24-hour urinary protein and serum uric acid (p < 0.05). No significant changes were seen in the hemoglobin or serum potassium levels. The rate of histopathological progression was significantly lower in the losartan group. No patient was discharged from the study due to side effects.",

This article reviews the safety of calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists in children with hypertension.

    "591": "Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has proven very useful in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF) and progressive renal failure. More recently, agents that directly block the angiotensin II Type 1 (AT(1)) receptor--angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs)--have been developed. These agents are thought to have a more specific mechanism of action since they do not affect other hormone systems as do the ACE inhibitors. Whether such specificity results in a different efficacy profile is still being determined. However, these drugs are extremely well-tolerated and very safe. AIIRAs are effective in the reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and compare favourably to other classes of agents. Recent results indicate that at least one AIIRA has a favourable effect on stroke in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Additional studies with other members of the class will provide further information on similar outcomes. In CHF patients, ACE inhibitors remain the drug of choice and AIIRAs are best utilised in patients who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor or in those receiving an ACE inhibitor who cannot tolerate a beta-blocker and need additional therapy. AIIRAs are effective in slowing the progression of renal failure in patients with Type II diabetes and may be effective in other proteinuric conditions. Whether they are more or less effective than ACE inhibitors is unknown. Overall, AIIRAs represent an important addition to the armamentarium of cardiovascular therapies with an excellent safety record and an emerging profile of utility in multiple cardiovascular conditions.",

Partially deacetylated chitosans, 90, 75, and 50% deacetylated chitosan, were prepared from crab chitin by N-deacetylation with 40% sodium hydroxide solution for durations. In addition, nine kinds of hetero-COSs with relatively high molecular masses (5000-10 000 Da; 90-HMWCOSs, 75-HMWCOSs, and 50-HMWCOSs), medium molecular masses (1000-5000 Da; 90-MMWCOSs, 75-MMWCOSs, and 50-MMWCOSs), and low molecular masses (below 1000 Da; 90-LMWCOSs, 75-LMWCOSs, and 50-LMWCOSs) were prepared using an ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor system. ACE inhibitory activity of hetero-COSs was dependent on the degree of deacetylation of chitosans. 50-MMWCOSs that are COSs hydrolyzed from 50% deacetylated chitosan, the relatively lowest degree of deacetylation, exhibited the highest ACE inhibitory activity, and the IC(50) value was 1.22 +/- 0.13 mg/mL. In addition, the ACE inhibition pattern of the 50-MMWCOSs was investigated by Lineweaver-Burk plots, and the inhibition pattern was found to be competitive.",

Maximal reduction occurred 2 h after oral administration of MRW, whereas MRWRD showed maximal decrease 4 h after oral administration at doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg, respectively. IAYKPAG also exerted antihypertensive activity after oral administration at the dose of 100 mg/kg, giving a maximum decrease 4 h after oral administration. IAYKP, IAY, and KP, the fragment peptides of IAYKPAG, also exerted antihypertensive activity.

    "594": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) like captopril and enalapril, can induce persistant cough in man. Noscapine, an antitussive alkaloid, can be used to suppress ACEI-induced cough. Some workers have suggested a role for bradykinin in precipitation of ACE-induced cough. Work carried out in our laboratory has shown noscapine to be a non-competitive inhibitor of bradykinin in guinea pig ileum. It is therefore possible that noscapine suppresses cough by blocking the effect of bradykinin receptor activation in the airways. Guinea pigs were placed in a cough-chamber connected to an air pump and a pressure transducer. Capsaicin was sprayed into the chamber and cough was recorded as a distinctive change in air pressure inside the cough-chamber. Animals treated with 1 mg/kg captopril and enalapril for 7 days, showed increased cough response. Ten microgram/kg FR190997, a non-peptide agonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor, also increased the cough response. Noscapine at 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg was able to reverse the effects of ACEI and FR190997. Naloxone, a specific opioid receptor inhibitor, did not block the antitussive effects of noscapine in enalapril or FR190997 treated guinea pigs. This antitussive effect of noscapine is not mediated via the mu, kappa or delta opioid receptors. It is therefore possible that noscapine exerts its antitussive action by interfering with the bradykinin cough mediation.",

The present work describes the molecular modeling of the N-terminal human somatic ACE in complex with the inhibitor lisinopril, identifying the residues involved in the inhibitor-binding pocket. The obtained results identify differences in the lisinopril lysine moiety-binding residues for N- and C-terminals of sACE domains and an important carboxy-terminal proline hydrophobic accommodations mediated by the aromatic ring of Tyr532 and Tyr1128 residues, respectively. The present model will be useful for the development of a new inhibitor family based on the natural BPP peptides and derivatives, or even to improve the binding capacities and the domain specificity of the already known inhibitors.",

In 2 patients, hyperkalemia followed initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy, whereas 1 patient experienced hyperkalemia after a dose increase of an ACE inhibitor, and the fourth patient was on continuous ACE-inhibitor therapy at the time of the hyperkalemia episode. Two of the 3 patients with functioning kidneys required hemodialysis to correct the hyperkalemia, whereas the other patient was on long-term hemodialysis therapy. In the 2 patients in whom transtubular potassium (K+) gradients were available, their values ranged far below normal, indicating tubular failure to secrete K+. This abnormality was attributed to decreased distal delivery of sodium and water and to renin/angiotensin II/aldosterone blockade. It has been proposed that aldosterone blockade impairs the capacity of the colonic epithelial cells to secrete K+. In all 4 patients the watery diarrhea ceased in parallel with the correction of serum K+ to normal values. It is suggested that hyperkalemia, most likely by stimulating intestinal motility, induced the watery diarrhea in all 4 patients. The watery diarrhea, however, failed to compensate for the renal tubular failure to secrete K+.",

Injury and lysis of capillary glomerular basement membrane, which is made up of type IV collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans, by serine proteinases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) likely is an important participant in the pathogenesis of crescentic glomerulonephritis. Tetracycline derivatives inhibit not only the activity of MMPs, but also their production, and have been investigated for the treatment of disorders in which the MMP system becomes amplified, such as degenerative osteoarthritis, periodontitis, cancer, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. We report an interesting case of crescentic glomerulonephritis in a young man who was treated with cyclophosphamide and prednisone. The patient developed steroid-induced acne that was treated with long-term oral doxycycline therapy. During the period the patient was administered doxycycline, proteinuria decreased by 70% and recurred when doxycycline was stopped.

    "617": "Acute electrolytic lesions of the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract (commNTS) reduce blood pressure (BP) in SHR but not in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto and Wistar rats and abolish the pressor response to intravenous injection of potassium cyanide. We investigated the chronic effect of commNTS lesions on mean arterial pressure (MAP), and on baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflex responses in SHR. The contribution of the sympathetic nervous system and the hormones vasopressin and angiotensin II to maintenance of BP in lesioned SHR was also investigated. MAP fell to normotensive levels the day after lesioning the commNTS but returned to the hypertensive level 9 days later. The reflex tachycardia evoked by sodium nitroprusside remained attenuated for 10 days after commNTS lesions but became enhanced 30 days after commNTS lesions. The pressor component of the chemoreflex elicited by potassium cyanide remained blocked for 30 days after lesions. Vasopressin antagonist or ACE blocker did not change MAP in sham or commNTS-lesioned SHR. Ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium elicited similar reductions in MAP in sham and commNTS-lesioned SHR. Results demonstrated that commNTS lesions in SHR produce a transient fall in BP and a long-lasting inhibition of the pressor response of the chemoreflex. Therefore, the blockade of the pressor response to peripheral chemoreflex activation is not sufficient to chronically reduce MAP in SHR. In the chronic absence of the commNTS, other subnuclei of the NTS or other brain stem nuclei may reorganize to replace the function of commNTS neurons, restoring sympathetic activity and high BP in SHR.", 
    "618": "HIV infection is associated with several renal syndromes, including acute renal failure. Chronic renal failure directly linked to HIV infection includes thrombotic microangiopathic renal diseases, immune-mediated glomerulonephritides, and HIV-associated nephropathy. A renal biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis. The development of HIV-associated nephropathy has been definitively linked to renal cellular infection, but the disease affects only a minority of patients, typically men of African descent. Therefore, factors determining disease expression in infected patients must now be emphasized. The pathogenic mechanisms involved in HIV-associated renal disease remain obscure. Genetic factors, as well as renal cellular responses, mediated by HIV proteins (including an immune-activated microenvironment) capable of presenting antigen in susceptible hosts probably explain most cases. HIV-associated nephropathy has a characteristic pathologic phenotype, including glomerular, tubular, and interstitial changes, and ultrastructural findings. Infection of the glomerular epithelial cell, or podocyte, and consequent structural and biochemical changes may be pivotal in pathogenesis. The HIV-1 transgenic mouse is an important model for understanding disease pathogenesis, particularly the role of HIV proteins in mediating renal tissue injury. Rigorously controlled randomized trials have not evaluated treatment, but corticosteroids and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used. Highly active antiretroviral therapy seems to have decreased the incidence of end-stage renal disease related to HIV infection and, in case reports, to have improved renal functional and pathologic outcomes of HIV-associated nephropathy. Outcomes in patients undergoing hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have improved, and current research focuses on renal transplantation for treatment of HIV-infected patients.",

In the kidneys of the animals subjected to the experiment, in the cells of the proximal canaliculi dilution of the cytoplasm, numerous vacuoles in the apical and basal part of the cell, dilation of the intercellular space as well as more numerous lysosomes were observed. The above-described changes were more distinctly marked in animals which were given a higher dose of the drug. The studies in the electron microscope revealed morphofunctional changes of the nephron related to the application of the Captopril.

The goal of our research was to assess the association of ACE gene I/D polymorphism with myocardial infarction in Polish population regarding different variables related to the disease (smoking, concomitant hypertension, obesity, plasma cholesterol level and family history). To detect ACE I/D polymorphism method of Rigat with some modification was used. The study population consisted of 314 individuals of Polish origin. 178 of them suffered from acute myocardial infarction or have survived it. Another 136 people without apparent signs and symptoms of cardiovascular pathology or diabetes served as control subjects. No one from the control group reported positive family history. Both allele frequencies and genotype distribution did not differ substantially between study groups. They were similar to those reported in other Caucasian populations. Further analysis did not detect any important differences in allele and genotype frequencies between experimental and control subjects regarding body mass index, total plasma cholesterol level and concomitant arterial hypertension. Cigarette smoking status influenced allele frequencies and genotype distribution in the group of patients with premature myocardial infarction.

Myocardial infarction was induced by left descendant coronary artery ligation, and the contribution of ACE and NEP in the degradation of exogenous BK after a single passage through the coronary bed was assessed at 2, 5, and 36 days post-MI. BK degradation rate (V(max)/Km) was found to be significantly lower in hearts at 36 days (3.30 +/- 0.28 min(-1)) compared with 2 days (4.39 +/- 0.32 min(-1)) for noninfarcted hearts, but this reduction was just above the statistical level of significance for post-MI hearts. In infarcted hearts, V(max)/Km was increased significantly 5 days post-MI (4.91 +/- 0.28 min(-1)) compared with the 2 and 36 day-groups (3.43 +/- 0.20 and 2.78 +/- 0.16 min(-1), respectively). The difference between noninfarcted and MI was significant only 2 days post-MI. Treatment with the vasopeptidase inhibitor, omapatrilat, showed that the relative contribution of ACE and NEP combined increased over time in infarcted hearts and became significantly higher 36 versus 2 days post-MI. Finally, the treatment with an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat) and a NEP inhibitor (retrothiorphan) in the 36-day infarcted and noninfarcted hearts showed that the relative contribution of ACE in infarcted hearts was comparable with that of noninfarcted hearts, whereas the relative contribution of NEP was increased significantly in infarcted hearts. In conclusion, experimental MI in rats induces complex changes in the metabolism of exogenous BK. The changes resulted in an increased relative contribution of NEP 36 days after infarction.",

The activity of ACE, which is localized on the luminal surface of endothelial cells (EC), has been well documented in pulmonary EC; however, few data exist regarding the relative activity of ACE in the airway vasculature. Therefore, we measured ACE activity in cultured EC from the sheep bronchial artery and bronchial mucosa (microvascular) and compared it with pulmonary artery EC. The baseline level of total ACE activity (cellular plus secreted) was significantly greater in bronchial microvascular EC (1.24 +/- 0.24 mU/106 cells) compared with bronchial artery EC (0.59 +/- 0.15 mU/106 cells; P < 0.05) and comparable to pulmonary artery EC (1.12 +/- 0.14 mU/106 cells; P > 0.05). Measured ACE activity secreted into culture medium for each cell type was 64-74% of total activity and did not differ among the three EC types (P = 0.17). Hydrocortisone (10 microg/ml; 48-72 h) treatment resulted in a significant increase in ACE activity in bronchial EC. Likewise, TNF-alpha (0.1 ng/ml) treatment markedly increased ACE activity in all cell lysates (P < 0.05). We confirmed the importance of ACE activity in vivo since, at the highest dose of bradykinin studied (10-8 M), bronchial artery pressure at constant flow showed a greater decrease after captopril treatment (36% before vs. 60% after; P = 0.05). These results demonstrate high ACE expression of the bronchial microvasculature and suggest an important regulatory role for ACE in the metabolism of kinin peptides known to contribute to airway pathology.",

Pharmacy claims from 1995-1998 were available for 3353 newly diagnosed CHF patients (39.2% AA; N=1317) within the health maintenance organization. Rates of ACEI and BB use were 46.4% and 54.0%; 43.4% and 28.9%; and 40.7% and 18.6%, for Whites, AA, and other races, respectively. The relative risk reductions (RRR) for ACEI were 68.7%, P<.0001; 52.1%, P<.0001; and -36.3%, P=.56, for Whites, AA, and other races, respectively. The RRR for BB were 59.0%, P<.0001; 34.6%, P=.009; and 74.3%, P=.17, for Whites, AA, and other races, respectively. Age- and gender-adjusted survival rates for AA were significantly enhanced in those taking ACEI, BB, or a combination of the two: P<.001, P=.001, and P=.003, respectively. Although we could not control for selection bias, these data suggest that AA benefit from both ACEI and BB when treatment is initiated within the first year of CHF diagnosis. Future, similar analyses other databases should control for the duration of illness to avoid lead-time bias in AA with CHF.", 
    "633": "Cardiac memory (CM) has short- (STCM) and long-term (LTCM) components modulated by calcium and angiotensin II. LTCM is associated with reduced Ito and Kv4.3 mRNA levels. Because the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, contributes to CNS memory transcription, we hypothesized that it might be a transcriptional factor in CM, influenced by calcium and angiotensin II. We studied STCM in dogs that were AV sequentially paced (AVP) for 2 hours or sham-operated. STCM was evaluated with ECG and vectorcardiogram (VCG), and subepicardial biopsies were taken at 5 to 120 minutes and investigated for CREB. LTCM was studied in dogs paced for 3 weeks and in sham controls. At 3 weeks the heart was excised, biopsies obtained, and CRE binding tested. STCM induction occurred in AVP dogs but not in sham or AVP dogs treated with saralasin or nifedipine. Nuclear CREB was significantly decreased at 2 hours in the AVP no-drug group only. LTCM dogs manifested reduced binding of nuclear proteins to CRE, and CRE binding activity in the promoter region of Kv4.3. In conclusion, there is an association between STCM induction and decreased nuclear CREB that is angiotensin-modulated and calcium-dependent. Moreover, the decreased CRE binding after 3 weeks of AVP combined with CRE binding activity in the Kv4.3 promoter can explain the Kv4.3 mRNA and Ito downregulation that characterize LTCM.",

However, the intracellular mechanisms by which ACE inhibition preserves myocardial contractility are largely unclear. Using a model of heart failure induced by hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats, the mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors (ACEI) exert a beneficial effect on myocardial contractility were studied. Dahl salt-resistant (DR) rats, DS rats not given temocapril (DS/T-), and DS rats treated with temocapril (10 mg/kg per day from 10 to 17 weeks of age, DS/T+) were fed an 8% NaCl diet from 8 to 17 weeks of age (n=8, each group). Echocardiography, hemodynamic measurement, histology, contraction of isolated skinned papillary muscle, and Western blot analysis were carried out. At an elevated final blood pressure similar to that of the DS/T- rats, DS/T+ rats exhibited (1) a decrease in left ventricular (LV) mass associated with decreases in both cardiomyocyte size and interstitial fibrosis; (2) improvement of both systolic and diastolic LV function; and (3) an increase in caffeine contraction after constant Ca(2+)-loading with 8-bromo-cAMP into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) associated with an increase in Ser16-phosphorylated phospholamban, as compared with the DS/T- rats. In addition to inhibition of myocardial remodeling, a restoration of the Ca(2+)-handling ability of the SR by normalized phosphorylated phospholamban may contribute to the improved LV contractile function achieved by chronic treatment with an ACEI.", 
    "664": "In vascular tissues, angiotensin II is cleaved from angiotensin I by chymase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). In the normal state, chymase is stored in mast cells and has no angiotensin II-forming activity, while chymase is activated immediately where mast cells have been activated by local stimuli. A clinical trial of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for preventing restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was successful, but that of an ACE inhibitor was not. After balloon injury in dog vessels, chymase activity was significantly increased in the injured artery, and a chymase inhibitor and an ARB were effective in preventing the vascular proliferation, but an ACE inhibitor was ineffective. In dog grafted veins, intimal area, chymase activity, and angiotensin II concentration were significantly increased after the operation, while they were significantly suppressed by a chymase inhibitor. However, the chymase inhibitor, unlike ACE inhibitor and ARB, did not affect blood pressure. These reports indicate that local angiotensin II production by chymase is involved only in the injured vessels. Therefore, a chymase inhibitor may be useful for preventing vascular disorders without affecting blood pressure.",

However, local mechanisms may also importantly contribute to set arterial tone. Our aim, therefore, was to test whether pressure-induced myogenic constriction of resistance arteries in vitro--devoid of acute effects of circulating factors--is increased in CHF and to explore underlying mechanisms. (2) At 12 weeks after coronary ligation-induced myocardial infarction or SHAM-operations in rats, we studied isolated mesenteric arteries for myogenic constriction, determined as the active constriction (% of passive diameter) in response to stepwise increase in intraluminal pressure (20 - 160 mmHg), in the absence and presence of inhibitors of potentially involved modulators of myogenic constriction. (3) We found that myogenic constriction in mesenteric arteries from CHF rats was markedly increased compared to SHAM over the whole pressure range, the difference being most pronounced at 60 mmHg (24+/-2 versus 4+/-3%, respectively, P<0.001). (4) Both removal of the endothelium as well as inhibition of NO production (L-N(G)-monomethylarginine, 100 micro M) significantly increased myogenic constriction (+16 and +25%, respectively), the increase being similar in CHF- and SHAM-arteries (P=NS). Neither endothelin type A (ET(A))-receptor blockade (BQ123, 1 micro M) nor inhibition of perivascular (sympathetic) nerve conduction (tetrodotoxin, 100 nM) affected the myogenic response in either group. (5) Interestingly, increased myogenic constriction in CHF was fully reversed after angiotensin II type I (AT(1))-receptor blockade (candesartan, 100 nM; losartan, 10 micro M), which was without effect in SHAM. In contrast, neither angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (lisinopril, 1 micro M; captopril, 10 micro M) or AT(2)-receptor blockade (PD123319, 1 micro M), nor inhibition of superoxide production (superoxide dismutase, 50 U ml(-1)), TXA(2)-receptor blockade (SQ29,548, 1 micro M) or inhibition of cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins (indomethacin, 10 micro M) affected myogenic constriction. (6) Sensitivity of mesenteric arteries to angiotensin II (10 nM - 100 micro M) was increased (P<0.05) in CHF (pD(2) 7.1+/-0.4) compared to SHAM (pD(2) 6.2+/-0.3), while the sensitivity to KCl and phenylephrine was not different. (7) Our results demonstrate increased myogenic constriction in small mesenteric arteries of rats with CHF, potentially making it an important target for therapy in counteracting increased vascular resistance in CHF. Our results further suggest active and instantaneous participation of AT(1)-receptors in increased myogenic constriction in CHF, involving increased sensitivity of AT(1)-receptors rather than apparent ACE-mediated local angiotensin II production.", 
    "666": "Anemia in children after renal transplantation is more common than previously appreciated. Multiple factors appear to play roles in the development of post-transplant anemia, the most common of which is absolute and/or functional iron deficiency anemia. Most experts recommend that iron limited anemias in transplant patients should be diagnosed using the same criteria as for chronic renal failure patients. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels are expected to normalize after a successful renal transplantation with a normal kidney function, yet both EPO deficiency and resistance have been reported. While no large controlled trials comparing the effect of different immunosuppressive agents on erythropoiesis after transplantation have been performed, generalized bone marrow suppression attributable to azathioprine (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus, antithymocyte preparations has been reported. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) occurs rarely after transplantation and is characterized by the selective suppression of erythroid cells in the bone marrow. PRCA has been reported with the use of AZA, MMF, tacrolimus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), but not with cyclosporine (CSA) use. Post-transplant hemolytic uremic syndrome has been reported with orthoclone anti T-cell antibody (OKT3), CSA and tacrolimus therapy. Viral infections including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and human parvovirus B19 have been reported to cause generalized marrow suppression. Management of severe anemia associated with immunosuppressive drugs generally requires lowering the dose, drug substitution or, when possible, discontinuation of the drug.

However, studies have documented underutilization of these life saving drugs. Subsequently, results of other randomized clinical trials revealed the beneficial effects of angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone in heart failure with systolic dysfunction, which prompted several other guidelines. However, all these guidelines were primarily restricted to systolic dysfunction. Heart failure is as much a geriatric syndrome as it is a cardiac. Most heart failure patients are older adults. About half of the heart failure in older adults is not associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Two recent heart failure guidelines, from the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, published respectively in September and December 2001 included recommendations for patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function and other special populations, including older adults and those at end of life. The purpose of this article is to review the relevance of these two guidelines to heart failure patients living in long-term care facilities. As our population is aging, more heart failure patients are expected to live in long-term care facilities.

    "678": "Angiotensin II and sodium balance affect the status of each other and both--either separately or together--can lead to an increase in blood pressure. They also can cause vascular and cardiac damage due to direct effects and effects mediated by the blood pressure increase. This paper reviews the important interactions among these three variables. Acute blood pressure elevation during sleeping but not during waking hours causes cardiac hypertrophy in rats. Similarly, lowering of blood pressure with an angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor during sleep but not when awake causes regression of cardiac hypertrophy in rats with 2kidney (K)-1clip (C) Goldblatt hypertension. If angiotensin is given to rats on a low (0.4%) NaCl diet, blood pressure rises but there is less cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy is greatest after angiotensin administration in rats on a high (4%) NaCl diet. In both the 2K-1C and 1K-1C Goldblatt models, a high salt intake reduces the blood pressure lowering effect of captopril and losartan and prevents regression of cardiac hypertrophy. Combined administration of an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker to rats on a low (0.2%) NaCl diet produces a syndrome that leads to death with cardiac involution. All features of the syndrome are reversed or prevented by 4% NaCl intake. It is hypothesised that the interaction between angiotensin II and sodium intake can be explained by differences in the way protons produced by contracting cells are neutralized. The sodium hydrogen exchanger and the sodium 2 bicarbonate cotransporter are stimulated by the AT1 and angiotensin type 2 (AT2) receptor, respectively. If the ratio of receptors is altered in favour of the AT2 receptor, then less cardiac hypertrophy will result from the same workload. Review of the clinical literature reveals that many of these results in rats have correlations in clinical medicine. Thus high night time blood pressure is associated with a greater morbidity and high salt intake causes cardiac hypertrophy and vascular stiffness independent of blood pressure levels. When deciding on treatment in human hypertension these results have important clinical implications.", 
    "679": "An interaction effect between the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) and alpha-adducin (ADD1) Gly460Trp polymorphisms (G460W) on blood pressure regulation has recently been suggested, although its significance in the prognosis of renal function in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) has not been fully investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical manifestations and renal prognosis in 276 Japanese patients with histologically proven IgAN with respect to their ACE I/D and ADD1 G460W polymorphisms. The prognosis of renal function was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Baseline data, including blood pressures, proteinuria, renal function, and incidence of hypertension, were similar for the different genotypes of ACE and ADD1. The individual genotypes taken alone were not associated with the progression of renal dysfunction. However, renal survival of patients with the 460WW polymorphism of ADD1 was significantly worse within the group with the II genotype of ACE (Kaplan-Meier, log rank test; chi2=6.062, P=0.0138) but not for those with other ACE genotypes. In the Cox proportional-hazards regression model with adjustment for clinical risk factors, including hypertension, proteinuria, and no administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, the 460WW variant of ADD1 was a highly significant and independent risk factor only for patients with the ACE II genotype, with a hazard ratio of 3.65 (P=0.0016), but not for those with other ACE genotypes (hazard ratio=0.65, P=0.2902).

Renal gene expression of IGF-I and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) was determined during and after treatment. Renal function and morphology were investigated at adult age. In contrast to the beneficial effect of IGF-I, GH treatment in combination with enalapril further deteriorated both renal function and morphology as compared with enalapril treatment alone, demonstrating: reduced glomerular filtration rate, increased tubular dilation and further expansion of the outer medulla. Enalapril decreased medullary expression of IGF-I and increased renal expression of IGFBP-1, changes that were not affected by concomitant GH treatment. These findings indicate that GH and IGF-I have different roles in the renin-angiotensin system-mediated kidney development.", 
    "685": "The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in renal growth and development. Exposure of the neonate to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors increases mortality and results in growth retardation and abnormal renal development. It has been demonstrated that ACE inhibition in the developing kidney reduces the renal expression of growth factors, which may account for renal growth impairment. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between renal growth impairment and the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), TGF-beta receptor I [TbetaRI, activin-like kinase (ALK)-1 and ALK-5], and TGF-beta receptor II (TbetaRII). Newborn rat pups were treated with enalapril (30 mg/kg per day) or vehicle for 7 days, and kidneys were removed for Western blotting of TGF-beta1, ALK-1, ALK-5, and TbetaRII, and for RT-PCR of ALK-5 and TbetaRII. TGF-beta1, ALK-1, ALK-5, and TbetaRII were also detected by immunohistochemistry. Enalapril treatment resulted in an increased mortality (30.4%) by day 7, and reduced body weight and kidney weight ( P<0.05 versus vehicle). Enalapril decreased renal TGF-beta1, ALK-1, and ALK-5 protein expression ( P<0.05). Also, enalapril decreased ALK-5 mRNA expression ( P<0.05). TbetaRII expression was not changed by enalapril treatment. These results indicate that ACE inhibition in the developing kidney decreases TGF-beta1, ALK-1, and ALK-5 expression, which may account for renal growth impairment. TbetaRII may not be modulated by ACE inhibition in the developing kidney.",

The amino acid sequence of TmF was determined to be pGlu-Gly-Arg-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Pro-Ile-Pro-Pro (pGlu denotes pyroglutamic acid), which shared high homology with other BPPs. The molecular mass of TmF was 1.1107 kD as determinated by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), which was in accordance with the calculated value of 1.1106 kD. The potentiating unit of TmF to bradykinin-induced (BK-induced) contraction on the guinea-pig ileum in vitro was (1.13 +/-0.3) unit (mg/L), and TmF (5.0 x10(-4) mg/kg) increased the pressure-lowering-effect of bradykinin (5.0 x10(-5 )mg/kg) with approximate descent value of (14 +/-2) mmHg. In addition, TmF inhibited the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, 2 x10(-3) mg of TmF caused 50% inhibition (IC(50)) of angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) hydrolyzing activity to bradykinin.",

Women with serum creatinine levels of >125 mmol/l are at an increased risk for deterioration in renal function, hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia and obstetric complications. Rigid control of hypertension is crucial for a successful pregnancy outcome. A range of antihypertensive drugs are available with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors being contraindicated. Women on dialysis have low fertility rates that return to normal following renal transplantation. Immunosuppresive drugs are not associated with increased congenital anomalies. Transplant recipients are at an increased risk for infections that may have implications for the fetus. All groups have an increased risk for prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction. The percentage of pregnancies resulting in surviving infants in women with renal insufficiency and transplant recipients ranges from 80-100%. For women who conceive after dialysis, the likelihood of a surviving infant is approximately 50%.",

Immune challenge through injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides resulted in a tenfold increase of ACE gene transcripts in the hemocytes and is suggestive for a role of ACE in the cellular defense of the locust.

The survey was made in 92 patients with CHF, among them there were 42 females aged 50-76 years (mean 66 years) and 50 males aged 53-76 years (mean 68 years). All patients were divided into 3 groups according to NYHA classification. On admission blood samples were taken from all patients to determine plasma levels of BNP, c-GMP, ET-1, and NA. Then patients received captopril and furosemide. Next blood samples were taken between 5 and 7 day of the treatment, after entire remission symptoms of decompensation. Plasma levels of BNP, c-GMP, ET-1, and NA were estimated with radioimmunoassay. Our study showed that plasma levels of ET-1, BNP, c-GMP, and NA were increased in patients with CHF. 5-7 days of the treatment with ACE inhibitor and diuretic caused significant decrease of ET-1, BNP, and c-GMP levels, but did not influence NA plasma levels.

The close relationship between type 2 diabetes and hypertension makes the problem even more severe. The knowledge of the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II and the greater effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on reducing albuminuria suggested in the past a trend toward preferable use of these drugs in diabetic nephropathy. The first relevant clinical trials yielded rather poor conclusions because of lack of blind randomization and short duration. Subsequent double-blind studies with adequate numbers of patients and sufficient duration underlined the importance of blood pressure (BP) control as well as the rather poor response of diabetic nephropathy to any treatment. In most of these studies, the changes in albuminuria or microalbuminuria were a substitute end point for the renal function. Three clinical trials using angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), planned specifically to monitor the progression of renal damage, have been recently published. They showed better renal protection by ARB, as compared with placebo or calcium channel blockers (CCB), beyond or independently of the BP reduction. Nevertheless, these recent trials, like the previous ones with similar results, invariably demonstrate slightly better control of BP in the groups of the active drug. Another issue is that the vast majority of the patients need so many nonstudy drugs to keep their pressure under control, that the isolation of advantageous effects of certain drugs seems unrealistic.",

Although none of the three drug regimens affected BP, they were similarly effective in increasing the renal excretory responses to saline volume loading and in eliminating differences that existed between the untreated H and HGI groups. Although reduced tubular reabsorption activity contributed to the taurine- and enalapril-mediated augmentation in renal excretory function, enalapril also enhanced glomerular function. The augmentation in the glomerular filtration rate was greatest in the HGI rat treated with the combination of taurine and enalapril. Furthermore, all three drug regimens significantly reduced protein excretion in both H and HGI rats.",

Patients with diastolic HF should be treated with cautious use of diuretics and with a beta-blocker. An ACE inhibitor should be added if HF persists or an angiotensin receptor blocker if the patient cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor because of cough, angioedema, rash, or altered taste sensation.

Losartan (1 mg/100 g body weight [wt.]) and quinaprilat (1 mg/100 g body wt.) were administered intraperitoneally, once daily, starting 10 days after UN and one week after 5/6NX till the end of 10 weeks experimental period. Parameters characterizing the therapeutic effect were blood pressure, urinary protein excretion 4 and 10 weeks after the injury, and p-aminohippurate accumulation in renal cortical slices in vitro, hydroxy-proline concentration in renal tissue and morphology at the end of the experiment. Summarizing our results we state: (1) the angiotensin 1 receptor blocker losartan is more effective in UN-treated than in 5/6 NX rats, and (2) the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinaprilat is more effective than losartan because of the amelioration of blood pressure and OH-proline concentration in renal tissue of UN-treated rats.",

Therefore, the treatment of hypertension with diabetes in the elderly could be very important to prevent not only microangiopathy but also macroangiopathy. The optimal blood pressure levels to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality in diabetic elderly have been proposed 130/85 in JSH2000.

Studies have shown that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system(RAS) exerts beneficial effects beyond its blood pressure-lowing action. In patients with renal dysfunction, RAS inhibition occasionally causes further decline in renal function and hyperkalemia. Because of this, general physicians may hesitate to prescribe RAS inhibitors to patients with renal dysfunction. However, clinical studies have clearly shown that RAS inhibition is particularly beneficial in those patients. This article discusses the conditions associated with RAS inhibition-induced decline in renal function and measures to take against them.

When the doctors use anti-hypertensive medication, we have to take care not to worsen glucose or lipid profiles. Taking recent guidelines from US, Japan and Europe into considerations, blood pressure of diabetic patients should be controlled below 130-135/80 mmHg. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists are commonly recommended as first-line medicine to choose.

Diabetics are stratified into the high risk group irrespective of their blood pressure levels. Target blood pressure is less than 130/85 mmHg. Hypotensive agents will be initiated at more than 140/90 mmHg along with glycemic control and lifestyle modification. When their blood pressure is within the high normal(130-139/85-89 mmHg), lifestyle modification as well as glycemic control will be initiated. If their blood pressure is not lowered to less than 130/85 mmHg during the next 3-6 months, hypotensive agents will be started. ACEIs, Ca-antagonists and alpha-blockers will be the first line hypotensive agents, since these hypotensive agents improve organ damages and insulin sensitivity and do not worsen lipid metabolisms.

HOPE study reported that treatment of ACE-inhibitor in the patients with ASO for 5 years clearly decreased the relative risk for incidence of cardiovascular events comparing with the placebo group. Furthermore, UKPDS Group demonstrated that the adjusted odds ratios to the development of ASO for each 1% HbA1c increase and each 10 mmHg systolic blood pressure increase were respectively 1.28 and 1.25 from multivariate analysis. However, optimal levels of HbA1c and blood pressure for prevention of ASO still have not been suggested. Therefore, large-scale intervention trial in Japanese diabetic subjects should be needed.",

In addition, diabetes is likely to be accompanied by hypertension. Recently, many mega studies have reported that aggressive blood pressure reduction significantly reduced stroke. Therefore, the tighter control of blood pressure is required to prevent stroke in diabetic patients as compared with non-diabetic subjects. Desirable target pressure is less than 130/80 mmHg and the treatment in older patients should be almost the same as in younger patients, although blood reduction should be attempted safely and by a step.

Lewis study has demonstrated renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitor in type-1 diabetic nephropathy, and RENAAL and IDNT has documented that of angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker in type-2 diabetes. Moreover, potential efficacy of lipid lowering in prevention of diabetic nephropathy has been postulated in recent Steno-2, multifactorial intervention trial. Thus, simultaneous adjustment on hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia may lead to prevention and remission of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "739": "A 75-year-old male presented with an eruption characteristic of digitate dermatosis. The eruption cleared completely after discontinuation of lisinopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor). Eighteen months later a similar eruption recurred after using valsartan (a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II receptor). The eruption cleared after discontinuation of valsartan. Histologic findings in both eruptions were consistent with lymphomatoid drug eruption. This case is interesting in that the eruption occurred after the intake of two structurally unrelated drugs that interfere with angiotensin II function. This observation may shed light on the mechanisms that may be operative in provoking the lymphomatoid drug eruption.",

The lower rates of usage for these medications, particularly aspirin, may contribute to the increased 30-day mortality. These findings demonstrate a marked opportunity to improve care in this population.",

    "746": "The study was conducted according to an open, randomized, 2-period crossover design with a 2-week washout interval between doses. Twenty-four volunteers participated and all completed the study successfully. Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were determined in plasma by HPLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), Cmax and Cmax/AUC(0-infinity) were tested for bioequivalence after logarithmic transformation of data and ratios of tmax were evaluated non-parametrically.",

The criterion for noninferiority was a treatment difference of < or =3.0 mmHg in the reduction of 24-h mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from the end of the 4-week placebo washout period to the end of the 6-week active treatment period. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean reduction in 24-h DBP was 8.3+/-6.7 mmHg among telmisartan-treated patients (n=332) and 10.3+/-6.3 mmHg among losartan/HCTZ-treated patients (n=350). The mean adjusted difference in 24-h DBP between the two treatment groups was 1.9 mmHg, allowing rejection of the a priori null hypothesis of a treatment difference of >3 mmHg. The reduction in mean 24-h systolic blood pressure was 13.2+/-10.2 mmHg with telmisartan and 17.1+/-10.3 mmHg with losartan/HCTZ. Both drugs provided effective control over the 24-h dosing interval. Analyses of morning (0600-1159) ambulatory blood pressure monitoring DBP means and trough cuff DBP confirmed the noninferiority hypothesis of the protocol for telmisartan 80 mg vs losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg. The reductions in office blood pressures measured at trough in patients treated with telmisartan were -16.3/-9.6 and -18.5/-11.1 mmHg in the patients treated with losartan/HCTZ (difference -2.4/-1.2 mmHg). There were no differences between the side-effect profiles of the two treatments.",

    "754": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists ameliorate malignant nephrosclerotic lesions of thrombotic microangiopathy in salt-loaded, stroke-prone, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) without controlling hypertension. This suggests that angiotensin II (Ang II) and/or aldosterone (ALDO) plays a critical role in renal injury in this model. For evaluating their relative roles in the pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathy, SHRSP were adrenalectomized and infused with vehicle, Ang II, or ALDO or were sham-operated for adrenalectomy (SHAM). Saline-drinking rats were assigned to one of four groups: SHAM, adrenalectomy, adrenalectomy + Ang II (25 ng/min, subcutaneously), or adrenalectomy + ALDO (40 micro g/kg per d, subcutaneously). All SHRSP received dexamethasone (12 micro g/kg per d, subcutaneously). Adrenalectomy did not show changes in body weight, plasma creatinine, sodium and potassium, and daily urinary sodium and potassium excretion; did not prevent hypertension but prevented proteinuria (12 +/- 1 versus 49 +/- 3 mg/d; P < 0.01); and abrogated thrombotic microangiopathy and decreased plasma aldosterone (<16 versus 710 +/- 91 pg/ml; P < 0.001) compared with SHAM. Systolic BP in adrenalectomy + Ang II and adrenalectomy + ALDO (238 +/- 8 and 241 +/- 9 mmHg, respectively) was similar to SHAM. Despite Ang II infusion, proteinuria (17 +/- 9 mg/d) and thrombotic microangiopathy and plasma aldosterone (18 +/- 18 pg/ml) remained low but daily urinary excretion of sodium and potassium were not different from adrenalectomy + ALDO. Adrenalectomy + ALDO showed plasma aldosterone levels of 735 +/- 147 pg/ml; plasma potassium was lower; plasma creatinine and proteinuria (78 +/- 7 mg/d) were greater and thrombotic microangiopathy lesions were comparable to SHAM. These results demonstrate a pivotal role for aldosterone in the development of thrombotic microangiopathy, independent of hypertension.", 
    "755": "Diabetes is an escalating problem worldwide and a major cause of vascular disease, renal failure, and blindness, among other complications. The cellular mediators of high glucose-induced injury include activation of protein kinase C, accumulation of cell sorbitol from increased flux through the aldose reductase pathway, and generation of advanced glycosylation end products and reactive oxygen species, among others. Current strategies for preventing and slowing the progression of the macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes include optimization of glycemic control and BP, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II blockers, and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. However, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies, as these interventions, although they may slow, rarely halt the progression of diabetic complications. Central to this process is the elucidation of the molecular events that drive this complex disease and that are potential therapeutic targets. This review discusses the promise offered in this regard by global monitoring of cellular or tissue mRNA expression (so-called transcriptomics) and illustrates the potential of this approach by focusing on recent studies on the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "756": "Nonenzymatic reactions between sugars and the free amino groups on proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids result in molecular dysfunction through the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE). AGE have a wide range of chemical, cellular, and tissue effects through changes in charge, solubility, and conformation that characterize molecular senescence. AGE also interact with specific receptors and binding proteins to influence the expression of growth factors and cytokines, including TGF-beta1 and CTGF, thereby regulating the growth and proliferation of the various renal cell types. It seems that many of the pathogenic changes that occur in diabetic nephropathy may be induced by AGE. Drugs that either inhibit the formation of AGE or break AGE-induced cross-links have been shown to be renoprotective in experimental models of diabetic nephropathy. AGE are able to stimulate directly the production of extracellular matrix and inhibit its degradation. AGE modification of matrix proteins is also able to disrupt matrix-matrix and matrix-cell interactions, contributing to their profibrotic action. In addition, AGE significantly interact with the renin-angiotensin system. Recent studies have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are able to reduce the accumulation of AGE in diabetes, possibly via the inhibition of oxidative stress. This interaction may be a particularly important pathway for the development of AGE-induced damage, as it also can be attenuated by antioxidant therapy. In addition to being a consequence of oxidative stress, it is now clear that AGE can promote the generation of reactive oxygen species. It is likely that therapies that inhibit the formation of AGE will form an important part of future therapy in patients with diabetes, acting synergistically with conventional approaches to prevent diabetic renal injury.", 
    "757": "The effect of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) on elevation of reactive oxygen species and the viability of virulent wild-type and avirulent mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and S. enterica serovar Infantis was studied in a murine macrophage cell line (J774.2 cells). S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028 phoP and a rough lipopolysaccharide mutant of S. enterica serovar Infantis 1326/28 (phi(r)) (avirulent mutants) induced NADPH phagocytic oxidase gp91 (gp91(phox)) activity and a significant (P < 0.05) elevation of reactive oxygen species within 12 h without coculture with IFN-gamma. This coincided with reduced survival of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium14028 phoP or stasis of S. enterica serovar Infantis phi(r). Fluorometric studies indicated that expression of IFN-gamma on infected J774.2 cells was not significantly (P > 0.05) elevated. However, studies with the virulent S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains showed that a comparable level of control of bacterial numbers could only be achieved by coculture with IFN-gamma. This coincided with significant upregulation of IFN-gamma receptor alpha expression on the surface of J774.2 cells and was completely abolished by N-acetyl-L-cysteine captopril (an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species). Delay in reactive oxygen species induction due to a requirement for IFN-gamma and upregulation of IFN-gamma receptor alpha in macrophages infected with virulent salmonellae may result in greater dissemination of virulent salmonellae in host tissue.", 
    "758": "The influence of intracellular angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II) on the process of cell communication was investigated in isolated cell pairs from the failing heart of cardiomyopathic hamsters at 2 and at 6 months of age. Measurements of junctional conductance were performed on weekly coupled ventricular cells (4-5.3 nS) using two separated voltage clamp circuits. The results indicated that at 2 months of age, when no signs of heart failure are detected, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity is low and similar to controls (0.26 nmol/mg/min). Here the intracellular dialysis of angiotensin I (10(-8) M) caused a decline of junctional conductance of 33+/-3.6% (n=35) (P<0.05) within 10 min while the administration of the same concentration of Ang I elicited cell uncoupling in cell pairs of 6-month-old cardiomyopathic hamsters in which the ACE activity was enhanced (0.41+/-0.05 nmol/mg/min) (P<0.05). Intracellular administration of angiotensin II in cell pairs of 2-month-old hamsters caused a decline of junctional conductance of only 25+/-4.5% (n=35) (P<0.05) compared to cell uncoupling in 6-month-old cardiomyopathic hamsters. Intracellular losartan(10(-8) M) reduced the effect of intracellular Ang II by 68+/-3.5% (n=28) on 2-month-old hamsters and abolished the effect of the peptide on 6-month-old hamsters. To investigate the influence of endogenous angiotensin II on the regulation of cell coupling, enalapril maleate (10(-8) M) or enalaprilat (10(-9) M) was used. The results indicated that at 2 months of age, no change in cell coupling was elicited by the ACE inhibitor while at 6 months of age, there was an increment of cell coupling of 72+/-6.2% (P<0.05). Similar results were found with intracellular losartan (10(-8) M). These results support the view that endogenous angiotensin II is involved in the regulation of cell communication at an advanced stage of heart failure when the ACE activity is enhanced and the cardiac renin angiotensin system (RAS) is activated.", 
    "759": "The effects of the chronic oral treatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), separately or in combination with isradipine, captopril or hydralazine, on standard and temporal patterning sexual behavior of male rats were evaluated. L-Arginine and filtered water were used as control. L-NAME treatment decreased the copulatory rate and hit rate factors of sexual behavior. However, the initiation factor and temporal patterning were less modified by the drug. After 14 days of L-NAME treatment suspension the male rat sexual response was recovered. The three antihypertensive agents were able to reverse partially or totally the inhibitory effects of L-NAME, suggesting that the chronic oral treatment with L-NAME induces penile erection dysfunction by peripheral mechanisms. The present results suggest that chronic oral treatment with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor can be a relevant and powerful peripheral erectile dysfunction model to evaluate the effects of drugs on erectile function of male rats.",

All had severe chronic heart failure refractory to optimized oral therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and furosemide, were in New York Heart Association functional Class IV, and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of <15%, Right heart catheterization was performed in all patients (cardiac index 1.9 +/- 0.1 liters/min. m(2), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 30 +/- 2 mmHg, systemic vascular resistance index 2,827 +/- 253 dyn. s/cm(5). m(2)). As bridging therapy, patients received either prostaglandin E(1), prostaglandin E(1) and dobutamine or dobutamine alone as a continuous infusion.

More recently, experimental and clinical studies have also suggested that the RAS may have a pathogenetic role at other sites of micro- and macrovascular injury in diabetes. Complementing major advances into the understanding of the local, as distinct from the systemic RAS, a number of large clinical trials have examined whether blockade of the RAS might provide protection from the long-term complications of diabetes, beyond that due to blood pressure reduction alone. While some controversy remains, these studies have, in general, suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and more recently, angiotensin receptor blockade reduce the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular disease and possibly retinopathy. This review will focus on recent developments in our understanding of the tissue-based RAS and its role in end-organ injury in diabetes, the results of recent clinical trials and newer strategies for the pharmacological manipulation of the RAS.", 
    "766": "Patients with various renal diseases receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) were enrolled in a protocol to determine whether adding an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) reduces urinary protein excretion (UPE). All patients had significant proteinuria (range 517-8,562 mg/24 h) despite administration of CEI for at least 4 weeks. Following baseline measurements, losartan (50 mg/d) was started and testing was repeated at 1 month. Compared with CEI alone, combined CEI plus ARB reduced UPE by 45 +/- 8% (p < 0.005). Compared with CEI alone, CEI + ARB lowered UPE in each patient independent of baseline protein excretion or renal diagnosis. Reduction in proteinuria occurred independent of changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), suggesting that the mechanism involved local changes in glomerular dynamics. If renal angiotensin II (ANG II) formation occurred despite CEI, the ANG II formed would suppress plasma renin activity (PRA), and adding an ARB would cause PRA to rise. In 7 of 10 subjects, addition of ARB to CEI increased PRA (p < 0.03) suggesting that intrarenal ANG II formation occurred in CEI-treated subjects. As a second marker of ANG II tissue activity, we measured the effects adding ARB on plasma aldosterone (ALDO). In 9 of 10 subjects, ALDO was acutely lowered (p < 0.009) suggesting that ANG II levels were incompletely blocked by CEI. We conclude that: combined CEI and ARB reduces UPE greater than CEI alone; reduction in proteinuria is independent of changes in MAP or renal diagnosis; and the additive effects of CEI and ARB are due at least in part to greater inhibition ofANG II action at the tissue level in the kidneys and adrenal glomerulosa.",

The test drug was a newly developed bi-layer tablet containing a fixed combination of spirapril hydrochloride monohydrate and hydrochlorothiazide (Quadroplus). The reference formulations were tablets containing solely spirapril hydrochloride monohydrate (Quadropril) or hydrochlorothiazide (produced exclusively for study medication). For spirapril, spiraprilat and hydrochlorothiazide the 90% confidence intervals of the AUC(0-infinity) as a measure for the extent of absorption were entirely included within the equivalence range of 0.8 to 1.25 and the 90% confidence intervals of the Cmax as a measure for the rate of absorption were entirely included within the extended equivalence range of 0.7 to 1.43. Therefore, bioequivalence was concluded for the test and reference formulations. The results suggest that hydrochlorothiazide does not interact in the fixed combination with the pharmacokinetics of spirapril and vice versa.",

To control for temporal changes in the incidence of other cardiovascular conditions for which antihypertensive agents may be prescribed for their non-blood pressure-lowering effects (for example, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for heart failure or coronary artery disease), prescription rates for digoxin, loop diuretics, and nitrates were also examined.", 
    "771": "Prescriptions for all antihypertensive agents increased significantly between 1996 and 2001 [11% for thiazides, 45% for beta-blockers, 68% for ACE inhibitors, 19% for calcium channel blockers, and 4332% for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)]. Loop diuretic prescriptions increased 27%, but prescriptions for digoxin (-19%) and nitrates (-8%) declined over this time frame. Time series analyses demonstrated increases in the prescription growth rate for all four antihypertensive drug classes recommended in CHEP for the period 1999-2001 compared with 1996-1998, which were statistically significantly and of substantial magnitude (absolute annual increase in prescription growth rate of 4.6% (95% confidence interval 3.5-5.9%) for thiazides, 3.0% (1.8-4.2%) for beta-blockers, 8.2% (6.7-9.7%) for ACE inhibitors, and 6.1% (4.4-7.8%) for calcium channel blockers). The growth rate in nitrate prescriptions did not significantly change [1.1% (-0.6 to +3.0%)] and, although the changes in growth rate for loop diuretics [4.7% (3.2-6.3%)] and digoxin [2.1% (0.6-3.5%)] were statistically significant, they were of smaller magnitude than the changes in the four recommended antihypertensive agents. Similar results were observed when analysis was restricted to new prescriptions only.",

    "774": "Experiments were performed in SHRs treated for 4 weeks with amiloride 7.5 mg/kg per day, enalapril 6.0 mg/kg per day or vehicle, and in Sprague-Dawley rats (SDRs). After haemodynamic measurements were taken, the heart was removed and weighed and hydroxyproline (a marker of collagen content) was assayed. In separate rats, ventricular myocytes were isolated, their size determined, and [Ca2+]i and pHi examined using fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester and 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein tetrakis acetoxymethyl ester fluorescence, respectively.", 
    "775": "Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased, and the maximal rates of increase and of decrease in pressure with time in the left ventricle were decreased in SHRs compared with SDRs. Myocytes were larger and hydroxyproline was increased in the left ventricle, but not in the right ventricle of SHRs compared with SDRs. Amiloride and enalapril decreased systolic blood pressure in SHRs similarly, and improved diastolic function in these rats, enalapril more than amiloride. Both agents decreased left ventricular myocyte size to similar extents; however, whereas enalapril decreased the left ventricular hydroxyproline content, amiloride did not. Left ventricular myocytes from SHRs exhibited greater [Ca2+]i and pHi than those from SDRs; enalapril decreased [Ca2+]i more than amiloride, but amiloride decreased pHi more than enalapril.", 
    "776": "In SHRs, enalapril prevents left ventricular hypertrophy, collagen deposition, diastolic dysfunction, and increases in [Ca2+]i more effectively than does amiloride. In contrast, the latter prevents the increase in pHi more effectively than enalapril, despite similar reductions in blood pressure. These findings suggest that their effects do not depend solely on blood pressure reduction.", 
    "777": "Hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias commonly coexist in many patients. In this review, we will initially discuss arrhythmogenesis in hypertension, with particular emphasis on atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, whilst in the final part, we will focus our attention on the effects of anti-hypertensive therapies on supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and on sudden cardiac death prevention. Many patients with atrial fibrillation or frequent premature ventricular contractions have hypertension, and both need to be managed appropriately. Furthermore, hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy could cause a wide variety of ventricular arrhythmias, which could end in sudden cardiac arrest. Most anti-hypertensive therapies, such as the beta blockers or ACE inhibitors, by slowing or interrupting the progression towards atrial and ventricular remodelling might exert some anti-arrhythmic effect, thus reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death in these patients.", 
    "778": "Hypertension remains one of the most unmet medical needs of this century. While many drugs are available for treating hypertension, efforts are still insufficient to find potent therapeutic agents since cause for hypertension in all patients is not the same. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have emerged as an important class of drugs in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), protenuric renal disease, myocardial infarction and stroke. This class of drugs blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and prevents bradykinin breakdown. However, the lack of specificity of ACEIs leads to the frequent side effects like cough and angio-oedema. Recently developed, specific non-peptide and orally active angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have become the prime therapeutics as they alone or co-administration with ACE inhibitors can control the renin angiotensin disorders. This review explores recent developments in the design, synthesis, and structural modifications of ACE inhibitors as well as angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "779": "A review of the Electron-Conformational (EC) method of pharmacophore (Pha) identification and quantitative bioactivity prediction in drug design and toxicology is presented, which includes the latest advances and improvements of the method as a whole and details of its realization with illustration of results. In the first part devoted to Pha identification the data of conformational analysis and electronic structure calculation of each of the molecules in the training set are used to construct EC matrices of congruity (ECMC) that include atomic interaction indices as diagonal elements, and bond orders and interatomic distances as off-diagonal elements. Multiple comparisons of the ECMC's of the active compounds between themselves and with those of inactive compounds allows one to separate a relatively small number of matrix elements that within certain tolerances are common to all the ECMC's of the active compounds, while not present in the same combination in the inactive compounds. This is the EC submatrix of activity that represent the Pha, while the tolerances characterize the Pha flexibilities. Distinguished from QSAR approaches, the Pha is obtained here by computational (non-statistical) methods only. The second part of the problem, quantitative activity prediction, is based on using the Pha flexibilities together with the anti-Pha shielding and other auxiliary groups influence in a parameterization and regression analysis procedure that allows for quantitative prediction. An original approach is suggested that side steps the multi-conformational implications. This post-Pha problem is similar to a QSAR approach with special physically transparent descriptors that allow one to avoid chance correlations in the regression procedure. Illustration of the method is given for several drug design problems in which, where sufficiently accurate experimental data are available, the identification of the Pha as a necessary condition of activity is almost 100% correct, while quantitative activity prediction is near to the accuracy of the experimental data, 80% - 90%.", 
    "780": "The effect of long-term administration of delapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and candesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, on cardiac hypertrophy was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Delapril (2 mg/kg/ day) and candesartan (2 mg/kg/day) were administered for 5 weeks to 15-week-old male SHR. Echocardiographic estimation of cardiac morphology and function revealed cardiac hypertrophy in SHR compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) which were used as normal controls. Both treated groups revealed regression of cardiac hypertrophy estimated by echocardiography. Heart to body weight ratio of treated SHR was also smaller than that of untreated SHR. Plasma BNP and ANP concentrations were increased in untreated SHR and decreased in the treated groups. Histological examination was performed using light microscopy and the area of fibrosis was estimated by computer. Reduction of the fibrotic area was observed in SHR treated with delapril and candesartan, although the latter was not statistically significant. Immunohistochemical examination using anti-collagen monoclonal antibody showed a decrease of type I collagen in treated SHR as compared with untreated SHR. It is concluded that both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker sufficiently reduce blood pressure in SHR associated with regression of cardiac remodeling.", 
    "781": "Thioredoxin (TRX) is a redox regulatory protein that protects cells from various stresses. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was reported to enhance endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. This study was carried out to investigate whether temocapril, a novel non-sulfhydryl containing ACE inhibitor, reduces the severity of myocarditis via redox regulation mechanisms involving TRX. Western blot showed that temocapril enhanced cytosolic redox regulatory protein TRX expression, but neither mitochondrial TRX2 nor antioxidant enzymes, such as copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) or manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) expression, was increased by the preconditioning treatment. In rats with experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM), the protein carbonyl content, a marker of cellular protein oxidation, was increased accompanied with enhanced TRX expression. An immunohistochemical study showed that TRX stain was enhanced in infiltrating inflammatory cells and in damaged myocytes. The severity of the myocarditis and the protein carbonyl contents were less increased in temocapril treatment (10 mg/kg/day, orally) from day 1 to day 21 in which TRX was up regulated when the inflammation started, but not in temocapril treatment from day 15-21 in which TRX was not up-regulated when the inflammation started. The results suggest that TRX and the redox state modified by TRX may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of EAM. Temocapril ameliorates myocarditis associated with inducing TRX increase in a preconditioning manner, although the mechanism of TRX induction by temocapril remains to be elucidated.", 
    "782": "This study aimed to examine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition improved cardiac fatty acid metabolism in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Myocardial 123I-beta-methyl-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid (123I-BMIPP) imaging was performed in 25 patients with CHF and in 10 control subjects. Myocardial 123I-BMIPP images were obtained 30 min and 4 h after tracer injection. The heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio of 123I-BMIPP uptake and the washout rate of 123I-BMIPP from the myocardium were calculated. Patients were given enalapril for 6 months, and 123I-BMIPP imaging was repeated. H/M ratios on early and delayed images were lower in CHF patients than in normal controls (P<0.01). The washout rate of 123I-BMIPP from the myocardium was faster in CHF patients than in controls (P<0.01). As the severity of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class increased, the H/M ratio decreased and the washout rate increased. The washout rate of 123I-BMIPP was inversely correlated with left ventricular fractional shortening (R=-0.62, P<0.01). ACE inhibition with enalapril increased the H/M ratio on delayed images (P<0.05) and reduced the washout rate of 123I-BMIPP (P<0.05) in CHF patients. These data suggest that: (1) angiotensin II-mediated intracellular signalling activation may be a possible mechanism for the decreased myocardial uptake and enhanced washout of 123I-BMIPP in heart failure patients; and (2) the improvement in fatty acid metabolism by ACE inhibition may represent a new mechanism for the beneficial effect of this therapy in heart failure.", 
    "783": "The World Health Organisation strongly recommends strategies for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, knowing the epidemics of the disease and its strong association with that of obesity. Several intervention studies, in China (\"Da-Qing Study\"), in Europe (\"Malm\u00f6 study\", \"Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study\") and in the United States (\"Diabetes Prevention Program\"), showed that lifestyle change are able to reduce by around 50% the incidence of type 2 diabetes in at risk individuals. Various pharmacological approaches have also proven their efficacy in preventing type 2 diabetes, but in most cases with less impressive reductions, between 25% and 35%. It is the case for metformin, acarbose, orlistat or various inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. After the report of promising results with troglitazone, large prospective studies are ongoing to test the efficacy of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone in such an indication, two insulinsensitizers of the thiazolidinedione family. We will briefly described the main results of intervention studies to prevent type 2 diabetes in at risk subjects, because of the presence of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and/or arterial hypertension.", 
    "784": "To examine whether an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazepril, can be transformed to the active metabolite, benazeprilat, by severely injured liver of dogs with ascitic heartworm disease, benazepril hydrochloride was administered orally to dogs once daily for 7 consecutive days at a dose rate of 0.29 mg/kg to 0.63 mg/kg of body weight, and plasma benazepril and benazeprilat concentrations were determined on the 1st and 7th administration days. In 7 dogs with ascitic pulmonary heartworm disease, plasma benazeprilat concentrations tended to be higher than in 7 control dogs both on the 1st and 7th administration days. The peak concentration and area under the concentration-time curve tended to be greater in dogs of the ascites group than in control dogs, but the statistics could not detect significant differences in the time to peak concentration and t(1/2) between the control and ascites groups. Plasma ACE activities decreased after administration of benazepril. In dogs with ascitic heartworm disease, benazepril was readily transformed to benazeprilat by the liver, and was effective for suppression of plasma ACE activity.", 
    "785": "The term metabolic syndrome refers to a virulent and lethal group of atherosclerotic risk factors, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, obesity, and hypertension. This syndrome affects some 47 million people in the United States, placing them at increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Particularly prominent as a risk factor for development of heart disease is central obesity. Immediate treatment of the metabolic syndrome is essential because these patients quickly develop diabetes, CAD, and stroke. Treatment is a multifactorial process and includes diet, exercise, and pharmacologic therapy. The latter consists of statins, fibrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones, all of which can decrease the risk and incidence of CAD.", 
    "786": "Long-term statin use achieves a significant reduction in mortality (24% to 42%) for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) that is equal to or greater than that seen with other secondary prevention medications, including aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In patients with diabetes, the reduction in mortality exceeds that seen with tight glycemic control or any other treatment for diabetes. Several studies have found that almost all patients with atherosclerosis are considered candidates for statin treatment. The scientific evidence needed to revise the national guidelines has been provided by showing that initiation of statins before hospital discharge results in (1). a marked increase in long-term treatment rates, (2). improved long-term patient compliance, (3). more patients reaching levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol <100 mg/dL, and (4). improved clinical outcome. Nonetheless, many studies in a variety of clinical settings have demonstrated that, regardless of the health care delivery system, an unacceptable number of patients with atherosclerosis are left untreated or undertreated with statin therapy. Applying hospital-based systems has been demonstrated to address the problems of underuse. The national guidelines now recommend that, in addition to diet and exercise counseling, lipid-lowering medications be initiated before hospital discharge for patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. Optimal use of statins and other cardioprotective medications in high-risk patients could save >83000 lives per year in the United States.",

Treatment arms of the same drug class, weighted for the number of patients, were combined. Analysis of covariance was performed to detect differences among drug classes in effects on left ventricular structure.", 
    "789": "Eighty trials with 146 active treatment arms (n = 3767 patients) and 17 placebo arms (n = 346 patients) were identified. Adjusted for treatment duration and change in diastolic blood pressure, there was a significant difference (P = 0.004) among medication classes: left ventricular mass index decreased by 13% with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8% to 18%), by 11% with calcium antagonists (95% CI: 9% to 13%), by 10% with ACE inhibitors (95% CI: 8% to 12%), by 8% with diuretics (95% CI: 5% to 10%), and by 6% with beta-blockers (95% CI: 3% to 8%).

Purification of these compounds was achieved with the use of various chromatographic methods. The structures of the compounds were identified on the basis of MS and NMR data analysis. Compounds 1 - 3 inhibited angiotensin I converting enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner, displaying 50 % inhibitory concentration values of 165.0 microM, 312.8 microM, 526.5 microM, respectively. The presence of these active substances may be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive action of the bulbs of Fritillaria ussuriensis.", 
    "792": "The tannins are natural polyphenols, able to precipitate water-soluble alkaloids and possess an inhibitory action on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). We identified 18 polyphenolic compounds (tannins) from Chinese herbs and examined the in vitro effects of these tannins on ACE activity, including determination of the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50), specificity and mode of inhibition. We also assessed the in vivo inhibitory effect of the tannins on angiotensin I-induced blood pressure elevation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Nine tannins with an IC50 <200 microM for ACE inhibitors were identified belonging to three tannin classes: caffeoylquinates, flavan-3-ols and gallotannins. In vitro, we found caffeoylquinates chelate the ACE zinc cofactor. Two of the flavan-3-ols: epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate and epigallocatechin-3-O-methylgallate, and one of gallotannin: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose were non-specific inhibitors because also reduced the activity of trypsin and chymotrypsin. The ACE inhibition of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose was also reduced after addition of bovine serum albumin, suggesting a non-specific mode of action. In vivo, 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose and epigallocatechin-3-O-methylgallate had a strong dose-dependent hypotensive effect reducing the blood pressure significantly in the SHR with infusion of the angiotensin I. These findings indicate that some of the tannins isolated from herbs inhibit ACE activity non-specifically. The ACE inhibitory effect of these tannins may explain the hypotensive effects of some traditional Chinese herbs.", 
    "793": "Microalbuminuria is an early marker of diabetic nephropathy and its prevention is considered key for the primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have specific renoprotective properties in diabetes, and preliminary evidence is available that they are more effective in combination than either of the two agents alone in limiting albuminuria either in micro- or macroalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients. The BErgamo NEphrologic DIabetes Complications Trial (BENEDICT) is a prospective, randomized, double-blind parallel-group study primarily aimed at evaluating the possibility of preventing the progression to microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion [UAE] rate 20-200 microg/min, i.e., incipient nephropathy) in 1209 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients with a normal UAE rate (<20 microg/min). During phase A of the study, patients are randomized to a 3-year treatment with one of the following: (1) a nondihydropyridine CCB (verapamil SR 240 mg/day); (2) an ACE inhibitor (trandolapril 2 mg/day); (3) the combination of the above study drugs (verapamil SR 180 mg/day plus trandolapril 2 mg/day); or (4) placebo. Phase B of the study evaluates the progression to macroalbuminuria (UAE> or =200 microg/min) in patients who progress to microalbuminuria in phase A or are found with microalbuminuria during the screening phase; these patients are randomized to a 2-year treatment with either trandolapril (2 mg/day) alone or verapamil SR (180 mg/day) plus trandolapril (2 mg/day). BENEDICT final results are expected to be available by the end of 2003 for phase A and 2 years later for phase B. The BENEDICT study, in addition to exploring whether primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy is an achievable goal, will also offer an opportunity to study prospectively risk factors of nephropathy and other chronic complications of type 2 diabetes. Here we provide an overview of the protocol and summarize the main baseline demographic, biochemical, and clinical characteristics of randomized participants.", 
    "794": "The leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is diabetic nephropathy. Interventions that prevent or palliate renal disease have a positive impact by improving patient care and diminishing healthcare costs. The following review summarizes clinical trals that evaluated treatment in various patient populations including Type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, subjects with proteinuric non-diabetic nephropathies, and Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy. These clinical trials have demonstrated that agents directly affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system provide renal protection beyond that attributable to blood pressure control.", 
    "795": "An interim analysis of the AASK trial at three years demonstrates a renoprotective effect [slower decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), delayed onset of significant decrease in GFR, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death, and a decrease in urinary protein excretion] of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, as compared to the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP-CCB), amlodipine, in patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. The beneficial effect occurred in the presence of similar levels of blood pressure control and was apparent in patients with proteinuric (beyond the threshold of \"dipstick positive\" proteinuria, 300 mg/day) and non-proteinuric hypertensive nephrosclerosis. At the time of the interim analysis, the effectiveness of the beta-blocker metoprolol was not significantly different from that of the ACE inhibitor. The data suggest that DHP-CCBs should be used with caution in the presence of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency.",

In November 1995, we introduced a renal and cardiovascular treatment program into the Tiwi community, which has a three- to fivefold increase in death rates and a recent annual incidence of treated end-stage renal disease (ESRD) of 2760 per million. Our previous study described an estimated 50% reduction in renal failure and all-cause natural deaths in the treatment group through December 31, 1998. We now describe a reduction in these events through mid 2000.", 
    "797": "People eligible for treatment were those with confirmed hypertension, diabetics with microalbuminuria or overt albuminuria, and people with overt albuminuria, regardless of blood pressure and diabetes. Treatment centered around the use of perindopril (Coversyl, Servier), with additional agents as needed to reach defined blood pressure goals, attempts at control of glucose and lipid levels, and health education. Two hundred and sixty-seven people, or 30% of the adult population, have been enrolled, with mean follow up of 3.39 years. Rates of terminal endpoints were compared on an intention-to-treat basis with those of 327 historical controls matched for baseline disease severity, who were followed for a mean of 3.18 years in the pre-treatment program era, against a background of no treatment or inconsistent changing treatment.", 
    "798": "Terminal events occurred in 38 controls and 23 people in the treatment group. The estimated rate of natural deaths in the treatment group was 50% that of the controls, (P=0.012); the rate of renal deaths was 47% (P=0.038) and the rate of non-renal deaths was 54% that of controls (P=0.085). Survival benefit in the treatment group was observed at all levels of overt albuminuria, in non-diabetics and diabetics, in normotensive as well as hypertensive people, and in people who had been taking angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACEi) in the pre-program era, as well as those who had not. Benefit was absent among the low death rates of people without overt albuminuria, and questionable among people with glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) <60 mL/min. The number of people needed to treat (NNT) to avoid one terminal event of natural causes was calculated at only 11.6.", 
    "799": "Falling rates of deaths and renal failure in the whole community support marked benefit of the program. Millions of dollars have been saved, based on avoidance of dialysis alone, but the reduction in premature death is the greater benefit. Chronic disease programs like this are enormously effective, and should be introduced into to all high-risk communities as a matter of urgency.", 
    "800": "Digoxin therapy has no effect on mortality in heart failure. Digoxin may be useful for maintaining clinical stability and exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Digoxin appears to be of most benefit in patients with severe heart failure, cardiomegaly and a third heart sound. Digoxin should be used as a second-line drug after diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients with congestive heart failure who are in sinus rhythm. Digoxin should be used as a first-line drug in patients with congestive heart failure who are in atrial fibrillation. ARRHYTHMIAS: Digoxin has a limited, but useful, role, either alone or in combination with other agents such as beta-blockers, diltiazem or verapamil, in achieving satisfactory resting ventricular rate control in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. In patients who lead a predominantly sedentary lifestyle (perhaps particularly in those who are elderly), digoxin alone may be the agent of choice.", 
    "801": "The ever-increasing introduction of new therapeutic agents means that the potential for drug interactions is likely to escalate. Numerous different classes of drugs are currently used to treat hypertension. The angiotensin receptor blockers offer one of the newest approaches to the management of patients with high blood pressure. Compared with other classes of antihypertensive agents, the angiotensin receptor blockers appear overall to have a low potential for drug interactions, but variations within the class have been detected. Losartan and irbesartan have a greater affinity for cytochrome p450 (CYP) isoenzymes and, thus, are more likely to be implicated in drug interactions. There is pharmacokinetic evidence to suggest that such interactions could have a clinical impact. Candesartan cilexetil, valsartan and eprosartan have variable but generally modest affinity and telmisartan has no affinity for any of the CYP isoenzymes. In vitro studies and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation can provide evidence for some interactions, but only a relatively small number of drug combinations are usually studied in this way. The absence of any pharmacokinetic evidence of drug interaction, however, should not lead to complacency. Patients should be made aware of possible interactions, especially involving the concurrent use of over-the-counter products, and it may be prudent for all patients receiving antihypertensive treatment to be monitored for possible drug interactions at their regular check-ups. The physician can help by prescribing agents with a low potential for interaction, such as angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "802": "Angiotensin-convertng enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are well recognized for their benefits in treating hypertension and congestive heart failure and preventing postmyocardial infarction heart failure or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Recently, blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor was shown to reduce cardiovascular events in hypertensive subjects with LV hypertrophy. Several lines of evidence are now converging to show that ACE inhibitors may affect the atherosclerotic process itself. Emerging clinical data indicate that angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) may possibly modulate atherosclerosis as well. The antiatherogenic properties of ACE inhibitors and ARBs may derive from inhibition or blockade of angiotensin II, now recognized as an agent that increases oxidative stress.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin-receptor blockade also increase endothelial nitric oxide formation, which improves endothelial function. In contrast to the effects of ARBs, the vascular effects of ACE inhibitors may, in part, be mediated by an increase in bradykinin. This article reviews some of the biologic mechanisms whereby ACE inhibitors and ARBs may modulate atherosclerosis.",

    "804": "The principal aim of this study was to determine the incidence of Myocardial Infarction in the population aged 25-74 in Navarra, lethality after 28 days, and the characteristics of the treatment applied in the hospitals during the years 1997-1998. A search was conducted for possible cases of heart attack in the hospital services responsible for attending to them, by means of a review of clinical histories. The lethal cases that did not reach the hospitals were researched through the statistical bulletins of deaths, with the information on these deaths completed through the family doctors. 1,059 coronary events were registered, which corresponded to a crude rate of attack of 238 cases per 100,000 amongst men and 59 cases per 100,000 amongst women. Amongst the male patients who reached hospital alive, 50% were smokers, 41% showed hypercholesterolaemia, 35.9% were hypertense and 16% were diabetic. Amongst the women, who showed a higher average age, arterial hypertension was the most frequent risk factor, with 66%. During hospitalisation thrombolysis was carried out on 39.2% of the patients, primary or rescue angioplasty on 4.6%; aspirin or other anticoagulants were administered to 94.2%, beta-blockers to 60.6% and IECA to 37.4%. This study has shown that the frequency of Myocardial Infarction in Navarra is lower than that registered in many European and North American countries, and is concordant with the low rates of mortality due to this cause. Global analysis of the data shows that a high implementation of the care guidelines for this disease with respect to the use of efficient therapies could be observed in the years 1997 and 1998. Nonetheless, with the exception of the use of anticoagulants, hospital variability has been observed in the use of thrombolytic therapy and adjuvant therapies such as the beta-blockers or ACE Inhibitor, and in the use of diagnostic techniques such as arteriography.", 
    "805": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an integral role in maintaining vascular tone, optimal salt and water homeostasis, and cardiac function in humans. However, it has been recognized in recent years that pathologic consequences may also result from overactivity of the RAAS. Clinical disease states such as renal artery stenosis, hypertension, diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies, left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure (CHF) are examples. Part of the adverse cardiorenal effects of the RAAS may be related to the prominent role that this system plays in the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the dysregulation of endothelial function and progression of atherosclerosis, as well as inhibition of the fibrinolytic system. Also, direct profibrotic actions of angiotensin II and aldosterone in the kidney and heart promote end organ injury. Current basic science and clinical research supports the use of inhibitors of the RAAS, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists in treating hypertension, improving diabetic nephropathy and other forms of chronic kidney disease, preventing or ameliorating CHF, and optimizing prognosis after myocardial infarction.",

By the Kaplan-Meier approach, survival was similar in groups 1 and 2, and significantly (P =.009) worse in group 3 compared with groups 1 and 2. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (including treatment, cause of heart disease, age, smoking, and diabetes mellitus), a time-dependent multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the combination of high-dose aspirin with an ACEI was independently associated with the risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.03; P =.01) and that the combination of low-dose aspirin with an ACEI was not (hazard ratio, 1.02; P =.18).",

We examined serum hs-CRP levels in consecutive patients with stable ischemic heart disease (IHD) (n=1231; 65+/-9 years; male/female, 927/304) and without IHD (n=226; 64+/-9 years; male/female, 117/109). Blood samples were collected on the day of catheterization. The hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in the IHD than in the non-IHD patients (0.32+/-0.52 vs. 0.24+/-0.29 mg/dl, P<0.05). Treatment with statins was associated with significantly lower hs-CRP levels in both groups (non-IHD, 0.17+/-0.14 vs. 0.26+/-0.31 mg/dl; IHD, 0.27+/-0.34 vs. 0.35+/-0.59 mg/dl; both P<0.05). hs-CRP levels were significantly lower only in IHD patients treated with A II-M than in those not treated with A II-M (0.28+/-0.34 vs. 0.34+/-0.58 mg/dl, P<0.05). Aspirin did not have any effect on the hs-CRP level in either group. The hs-CRP levels were significantly lower in IHD patients treated with statins and/or A II-M than those treated with neither statins nor A II-M (statin+/A II-M+, 0.28+/-0.29 mg/dl; statin+/A II-M-, 0.26+/-0.36 mg/dl; statin-/A II-M+, 0.28+/-0.37 mg/dl; statin-/A II-M-, 0.38+/-0.66 mg/dl; P<0.01). These results indicate that statins and A II-M, but not aspirin, in commonly used doses have an anti-inflammatory action as assessed by measurement of CRP levels in IHD patients.",

One hundred fifty-six patients with CHF and >90 ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) and/or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) on 24-hour Holter monitoring were randomly divided into 2 groups. All patients were given conventional therapy for CHF, consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, diuretics, and nitrates. Patients in the treatment group (n = 79) were also given berberine 1.2 to 2.0 g/day. The remaining 77 patients were given placebo. Symptoms, a 6-minute walk test, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), frequency and complexity of VPCs, and quality of life were assessed after 8 weeks of treatment and during a mean 24-month follow-up. After treatment with berberine, there was a significantly greater increase in LVEF, exercise capacity, improvement of the dyspnea-fatigue index, and a decrease of frequency and complexity of VPCs compared with the control group. There was a significant decrease in mortality in the berberine-treated patients during long-term follow-up (7 patients receiving treatment died vs 13 on placebo, p <0.02). Proarrhythmia was not observed, and there were no apparent side effects. Thus, berberine improved quality of life and decreased VPCs and mortality in patients with CHF.",

    "825": "1. Because we previously observed that angiotensin AT2 receptor stimulation decreased pressure-natriuresis, in the present study we examined the possible involvement of these receptors in altered sodium excretion shown by Lyon hypertensive (LH) rats. 2. In 9-week-old male anaesthetized LH rats and normotensive (LL) controls pretreated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (quinapril; 10 mg/kg) and an AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan; 10 mg/kg), angiotensin (Ang) II was infused (30 ng/kg per min) to stimulate AT2 receptors. In other groups of rats, an AT2 receptor antagonist (PD123319; 50 micro g/kg per min) was added before AngII infusion. 3. During AT2 receptor stimulation, LH differed from LL rats by significantly reduced renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate and pressure diuresis and natriuresis. The addition of PD123319 did not change total RBF, whereas it did increase pressure diuresis and natriuresis in both strains. However, the effects of PD123319 were less marked in LH rats than in LL rats. 4. These findings confirm that, under the present experimental conditions, AT2 receptors are antinatriuretic and are not of greater functional importance in hypertensive animals of the Lyon strain.",

Combined treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with AT1 receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) more than monotherapy with either agent. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of chronic dual renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition using non-hypotensive doses of the AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan cilexetil and the ACE inhibitor perindopril on cardiovascular function and structure. 2. Adult male SHR, aged 15 weeks, were divided into four groups: (i) candesartan cilexetil (0.5 mg/kg per day in drinking water); (ii) perindopril (0.3 mg/kg per day in drinking water); (iii) combined treatment (dual RAS inhibition); or (iv) the appropriate vehicle (0.1% ethanol/0.1% polyethylene glycol/1.5 mmol/l sodium bicarbonate dissolved in water for candesartan cilexetil; distilled water for perindopril). Systolic blood pressure was measured weekly using the tail-cuff method and urinary microalbuminuria was measured fortnightly. 3. After 4 weeks, rats were instrumented for intravenous drug administration and measurement of MAP. At this time, the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin (Ang) I and AngII (5-20 ng) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and acetylcholine (ACh; 1-5 micro g) were assessed. In addition, left ventricular : bodyweight and media : lumen ratios were determined as indices of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy, respectively. 4. Candesartan cilexetil and perindopril alone had minimal effect on MAP when measured both directly and indirectly, whereas direct MAP was significantly decreased in the combined treatment group (131 +/- 6 mmHg; P < 0.05) compared with the vehicle group (156 +/- 9 mmHg). Pressor responses to AngI were significantly decreased in all groups compared with the vehicle-treated group and pressor responses to AngII were significantly decreased in the candesartan cilexetil-treated (P < 0.01) and combined treatment groups (P < 0.01) compared with the vehicle-treated group. Depressor responses to ACh and SNP were not significantly affected by any of the antihypertensive therapies compared with vehicle-treated SHR. 5. Vascular hypertrophy was significantly decreased in the candesartan cilexetil and combined groups compared with the vehicle-treated group, whereas cardiac hypertrophy was reduced, with the rank order of effect being: dual RAS inhibition > perindopril > candesartan cilexetil. Urinary albumin tended to decrease with dual RAS inhibition, but was not significantly affected by this short-term treatment. 6. These results demonstrate the efficacy of low-dose dual RAS inhibition as an antihypertensive modality, at least in SHR, not only in reducing arterial pressure, but also in improving cardiovascular structure.",

At 12 months, 14 patients in the ramipril group and 22 in the control group developed anuria. With intention-to-treat multivariable analysis using the Cox model, it was estimated that at 3, 6, and 9 months, patients assigned to ramipril had a higher adjusted hazard of complete anuria than did patients assigned to no treatment. Of the 25 patients who still did not have complete anuria at 12 months, those assigned to ramipril had a better prognosis than did those assigned to no treatment (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.58 [CI, 0.36 to 0.94]).

New data from HOPE, LIFE, and ALLHAT underscores the importance of blood pressure reduction for patients with coronary artery disease. Despite our improved understanding of the mechanism by which the various classes of antihypertensive medications achieve their effect, it remains the case that blood pressure reduction remains more important than the medication used to achieve the reduction. For most patients with coronary artery disease, combination therapy will be required to achieve a target blood pressure of less than 140/80. When tolerated, this therapy should include a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor, both of which are of prognostic benefit for patients with coronary artery disease. There are also attractions in choosing calcium antagonists because of their efficacy in controlling anginal symptoms (Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers if already on a beta-blocking agent and rate-limiting calcium channel blockers if beta blockers are contraindicated). Thiazide diuretics have proven themselves effective again in the ALLHAT study and are likely to be an integral part of treatment for the great majority of patients with coronary artery disease.",

Most patients are treated medically, but when progressive hypertension, renal insufficiency, or circulatory congestion develops, revascularization should be considered. Endovascular procedures with arterial stents are now widely employed. These procedures sometimes offer major benefits in blood pressure control and stabilization of renal function. Stent procedures continue to entail hazards, including atheroemboli, arterial dissections, and thrombosis, in addition to restenosis rates of 14 to 20%. Small, randomized trials to date demonstrate no survival benefit to either endovascular or surgical revascularization as compared with medical management.

Cardiac remodeling plays important roles in the progression of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, valvular heart diseases, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition to cardiac myocytes, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix proteins and coronary vasculature are also involved in the remodeling process. Cardiac remodeling is associated with alterations of many mediators such as neurohumoral factors, cytokines, enzymes, ion channels, oxidative stress and mechanical stress. Although remodeling is initially an adaptive response to maintain normal cardiac function, it gradually becomes maladaptive and leads to progressive decompensation. Recent research has attempted to elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiac remodeling and to develop novel therapeutic strategies for heart failure. The modulation of remodeling process is effective for preventing the progression of heart failure.",

This action of progesterone is essential to provide an appropriate milieu for embryo-endometrial communication that can lead to implantation and the successful initiation of pregnancy. A temporal regulation of endometrial genes is most likely required to achieve an appropriate state of receptivity in the primate endometrium. Using simulated menstrual cycles in the rhesus monkey, endometrial tissue was harvested at days that encompass the expected window of receptivity (4-10 days after the estradiol surge) and subsequently converted to cycle day-specific cDNA populations. Using differential display reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, 12 cDNA fragments were isolated and sequenced whose mRNA levels were elevated during this time frame. The temporal expression patterns of these mRNAs were confirmed by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction. Two of these fragments exhibited high homology to previously characterized human genes: 1) secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, also known as antileukoprotease, an endometrial neutrophil elastase inhibitor with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties; and 2) syncytin, also known as endogenous retrovirus W envelope protein, a highly fusogenic membrane glycoprotein that induces formation of giant syncytia and is believed to be important in decidual and placental development.
