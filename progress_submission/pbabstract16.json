Geometric mean residual proteinuria was 1.68 (95% confidence interval 1.31 to 2.14) g/day during ACE inhibition plus a regular sodium diet. Addition of angiotensin receptor blockade to ACE inhibition reduced proteinuria to 1.44 (1.07 to 1.93) g/day (P=0.003), addition of a low sodium diet reduced it to 0.85 (0.66 to 1.10) g/day (P<0.001), and addition of angiotensin receptor blockade plus a low sodium diet reduced it to 0.67 (0.50 to 0.91) g/day (P<0.001). The reduction of proteinuria by the addition of a low sodium diet to ACE inhibition (51%, 95% confidence interval 43% to 58%) was significantly larger (P<0.001) than the reduction of proteinuria by the addition of angiotensin receptor blockade to ACE inhibition (21%, (8% to 32%) and was comparable (P=0.009, not significant after Bonferroni correction) to the reduction of proteinuria by the addition of both angiotensin receptor blockade and a low sodium diet to ACE inhibition (62%, 53% to 70%).

Effective management of patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina should consist of therapy aimed at symptom control and reduction of adverse clinical outcomes. Therapeutic options for angina include antianginal drugs: nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine, and myocardial revascularization. Recent trials have shown that although revascularization is slightly better in controlling symptoms, optimal medical therapy that includes aggressive risk factor modification is equally effective in reducing the risk of future coronary events and death. On the basis of the available data, it seems appropriate to prescribe optimal medical therapy in most patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina, and reserve myocardial revascularization for selected patients with disabling symptoms despite optimal medical therapy.",

The upstream blockade of the system induced by aliskiren, in combination with its unique pharmacological properties (inhibiting potency, high plasma concentration, long half-life and preferential partitioning in the kidney) makes this compound the ideal tool to achieve a complete blockade of the RAS. Consistent with expectations, present evidence indicates that aliskiren, at the licensed dosages of 150-300 mg/day, lowers blood pressure to the same extent as other first-line antihypertensive agents, with the additional advantage of a longer duration of action which persists for several days after the cessation of treatment. Moreover, aliskiren was found to act synergically not only with diuretics but also with other drug classes, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. In addition, results of recent clinical trials have shown that aliskiren possesses cardiovascular and renal protective properties which may contribute to the beneficial effects of this drug beyond the reduction of blood pressure. Finally, aliskiren has an excellent, placebo-like tolerability profile, a feature which is very relevant for improving compliance of patients.",

LVR is difficult to predict, and limited information is available on the association of cardiac biomarkers and LVR. Growth-differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is induced during heart failure development and, in animals models, might influence the different processes involved in cardiac remodeling. The aim of the present investigation was to assess the association between the serum levels of GDF-15 within the first 24 hours of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and the development of subsequent LVR at 12 months of follow-up. This prospective study included 97 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Echocardiography was performed in all patients within the first 96 hours of admission and at 12 months of follow-up. LVR was defined as a >20% increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume at 12 months of follow-up compared to baseline. Blood samples for the determination of GDF-15 and brain natriuretic peptide were obtained within the first 24 hours after symptom onset. According to the pre-established criteria, 21 patients (22%) had LVR. Patients with LVR had greater levels of GDF-15 at study entry (median 3,439 pg/ml, interquartile range 2,391 to 6,168 vs median 1998 pg/ml, interquartile range 1,204 to 3,067, respectively; p <0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that GDF-15 (odds ratio 10.1, 95% confidence interval 2.5 to 40.1, p <0.001) and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 12.3, p <0.01) were independents predictors of LVR. Receiving operating characteristics analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.77 for GDF-15 (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.84, p <0.001). In conclusion, the results of the present study have identified GDF-15 as an independent marker of LVR in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.",

Although individual reviews of specific classes of cardiovascular medications have been published previously, a more complete review of several classes has not been performed. The aim of this review is to evaluate the associations of various cardiovascular agents with the risk for developing cancer and provide guidance for clinicians. A comprehensive search of published research was conducted using MEDLINE from 1994 to 2011. Three trials demonstrated an increased risk for cancer using angiotensin II receptor blockers. Additionally, risk for cancer was shown in a number of trials that included the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Five trials suggested that diuretics increased the risk for specific cancers, especially in women and those who had been using diuretics for >4 years. Statins and ezetimibe, in contrast, did not show this increased risk. Prasugrel was shown to be associated with an increased risk for cancer in 1 study. It appears that the use of certain cardiovascular medications is associated with an increased risk for cancer. In conclusion, clinicians need to balance the risks and benefits of the use of these agents and provide the appropriate therapy on an individual basis.",

    "39": "Achieving optimal blood pressure and albuminuria control is a major therapeutic treatment goal in patients with renal insufficiency. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) are the mainstay of therapy in these patients. However, despite these therapies many patients remain at high risk of renal or cardiovascular disease that shows a relationship with albuminuria. Various approaches have been tested to maximize the efficacy of ACEI and ARB. Increasing the dose of an ACEI or ARB beyond the maximal registered antihypertensive dose causes a distinct decrease in albuminuria without additional effects on blood pressure. The combination of an ACEI and ARB is another possibility to further reduce albuminuria. However, the alleged beneficial effects on hard renal and cardiovascular outcome are not unambiguously demonstrated. Adding a direct renin inhibitor to an ACEI or ARB has been shown to lower albuminuria in patients with and without diabetes. Long-term trials are currently under way to determine the effects of direct renin inhibition on clinical outcomes. Volume excess has been shown to blunt the blood pressure and albuminuria response to ACEI or ARB therapy. Intervening in volume status by means of restricting dietary sodium intake or diuretic therapy has convincingly been shown to lower blood pressure and albuminuria. Whether this strategy translates into a reduction in the risk of renal or cardiovascular events has not (yet) been investigated in prospective randomized trials. Various options are at hand which have been shown to maximize the blood pressure and albuminuria response to ACEI and ARB treatment. However, long-term studies supporting the benefits of these strategies on hard renal and cardiovascular outcomes are warranted.",

However, study participants on ACE inhibitors had higher incidences of withdrawals due to adverse events, including syncope, cough, and hyperkalemia. Only 1 trial (TRANSCEND) met eligibility criteria for comparing standard therapies alone versus an ARB (telmisartan). No significant differences were observed for individual clinical endpoints across groups in TRANSCEND, although the composite measure (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal MI, and stroke) was significantly lower for telmisartan compared with placebo; like ACE inhibitors, ARB therapy increased the risk of hyperkalemia. Only 1 trial (ONTARGET) was identified that compared an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) with an ARB (telmisartan), and this trial showed that ramipril and telmisartan have similar efficacy, similar risks of harms, and therefore a similar balance of benefits to harms. ONTARGET showed that the risk reduction for all clinical endpoints was similar across the 3 treatment arms (ramipril, telmisartan, and combination therapy with ramipril and telmisartan). Combination therapy in ONTARGET was associated with a greater number of total study discontinuations, including discontinuations due to hypotension and syncope. Telmisartan compared with ramipiril had lower rates of cough and angioedema and a higher rate of hypotensive symptoms; there was no difference between ramipril and telmisartan in the rate of syncope.

    "45": "The presence of persistently elevated urinary concentrations of protein or albumin is considered a sign of kidney damage. The diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is nowadays based upon the presence of signs of kidney damage together with the estimation of the glomerular filtration rate.The presence of either proteinuria or albuminuria identifies a group of patients with higher risk of CKD progression and higher cardiovascular risk. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers,for instance, decreases both the progression of CKD and the incidence of cardiovascular events and death in patients with CKD and proteinuria. Thus, proteinuria is currently considered a therapeutic target by itself. Despite of the importance of detecting and monitoring proteinuria in the diagnosis and follow-up of CKD, there is not a consensus among the clinical practice guidelines published by different scientific societies on the diagnostic cut-off levels, on different sampling procedures,on the units used in laboratory reports or just on whether it should be defined in terms of albumin or proteinuria. The goal of this document, created by the consensus of the Spanish Society of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology(SEQC, representing its spanish acronym) and the Spanish Society of Nephrology (S.E.N.), is to recommend to medical and laboratory clinicians appropriate guidelines for the detection and monitorization of proteinuria as a marker of CKD in adults and children.

Substrate-dependence of the reaction kinetics was studied for GT and BT polyphenolic size fractions either < or > 3 kDa and also Green Tea Polyphenolic Isolate (GTPI), and revealed that enzyme velocity curves fitted allosteric, not Michaelis-Menten, relationships. Inhibition was weakly dependent on substrate concentration for GT fraction >3 kDa and independent of substrate concentration for all other GT and BT size fractions and GTPI. Furthermore, evidence for direct inactivation of ACE by GTPI was demonstrated.

An increase in serum potassium correlated positively with the decline in morning systolic BP. Even very low-dose (12.5 mg) spironolactone is clinically effective, although serum potassium should be carefully monitored.", 
    "53": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are widely used in therapy of cardiovascular diseases. However, the consensus on effects of these inhibitors in control of myocardial oxygen consumption during the process of experimental hypercholesterolemia and under the condition of endothelial dysfunction has not been reached. Here we examined effects of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on serum lipid levels and oxygen consumption rate in mitochondria isolated from heart of rabbits treated by hypercholesterolemic diet. During the twelve-week period, the Chinchilla male rabbits were daily treated by saline (controls); 1 % cholesterol diet; 5 mg/kg/day captopril or 1 % cholesterol + 5 mg/kg/day captopril. Total- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride in serum were measured spectrophotometrically. The left ventricle mitochondrial fraction was isolated and myocardial oxygen consumption was measured by Biological Oxygen Monitor. Mitochondria isolated from hearts of rabbits exposed to hypercholesterolemic diet showed significantly reduced respiration rates (state 3 and state 4) with altering adenosine diphosphate/oxygen ratio, whereas the respiratory control ratio was not affected when compared to controls. Mitochondria from cholesterol/captopril-treated animals showed significantly reduced respiration rates without altering adenosine diphosphate/oxygen ratio index or respiratory control ratio. Although captopril did not exert the favorable effect on serum lipid levels in cholesterol-treated animals, it restored the mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Further studies should be performed to define the underlying physiological and/or pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical implications.", 
    "54": "The scope of this study was to determine the ability of flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) proteins to release angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) peptides during simulated gastrointestinal (GI) digestion using a static (SM; no absorption in the intestinal phase) and a dynamic model (DM; simultaneous absorption of digested products in the intestinal phase via passive diffusion). Gastric and gastric + small intestinal digests of flaxseed proteins of both models possessed ACEI activity. The ACEI activity of the gastric + small intestinal digest in the DM (IC(50) unabsorbed, 0.05 mg N/mL; IC(50) absorbed, 0.04 mg N/mL) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the SM (IC(50), 0.39 mg N/mL). Two peptides, a pentapeptide (Trp-Asn-Ile/Leu-Asn-Ala) and a hexapeptide (Asn-Ile/Leu-Asp-Thr-Asp-Ile/Leu), were identified in the most active ACEI fraction (0.5-1 kDa) of the absorbable flaxseed protein digest by de novo sequencing.", 
    "55": "To compare the relative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in reducing cardiovascular mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients, we conducted an observational analysis of all patients initiated on ACEI or ARB therapy undergoing chronic hemodialysis at a large dialysis provider. Survival curves with mortality hazard ratios (HRs) were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. Outcomes were compared using inverse probability of treatment weighting and propensity score matching. Over 6 years, 22,800 patients were newly initiated on an ACEI and 5828 on an ARB after at least 60 days of chronic hemodialysis. After adjustment for baseline cardiovascular risk factors, there was no significant difference in the risk of cardiovascular, all-cause, or cerebrovascular mortality in patients initiated on an ARB compared with an ACEI (HR of 0.96). A third of 28,628 patients, newly started on an ACEI or ARB, went on to another antihypertensive medication in succession. After adjustment for risk factors, 701 patients initiated on combined ACEI and ARB therapy (HR of 1.45) or 6866 patients on ACEI and non-ARB antihypertensive agent (HR of 1.27) were at increased risk of cardiovascular death compared with 1758 patients initiated on an ARB and non-ACEI antihypertensive therapy. Thus, an ARB, in combination with another antihypertensive medication (but not an ACEI), may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality. As observational studies may be confounded by indication, even when adjusted, randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.", 
    "56": "Recent studies suggest that blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability contributes to epileptogenesis in symptomatic epilepsies. We have previously described angiogenesis, aberrant vascularization, and BBB alteration in drug-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Here, we investigated the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in an in vitro integrative model of vascular remodeling induced by epileptiform activity in rat organotypic hippocampal cultures. After kainate-induced seizure-like events (SLEs), we observed an overexpression of VEGF and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) as well as receptor activation. Vascular density and branching were significantly increased, whereas zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), a key protein of tight junctions (TJs), was downregulated. These effects were fully prevented by VEGF neutralization. Using selective inhibitors of VEGFR-2 signaling pathways, we found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is involved in cell survival, protein kinase C (PKC) in vascularization, and Src in ZO-1 regulation. Recombinant VEGF reproduced the kainate-induced vascular changes. As in the kainate model, VEGFR-2 and Src were involved in ZO-1 downregulation. These results showed that VEGF/VEGFR-2 initiates the vascular remodeling induced by SLEs and pointed out the roles of PKC in vascularization and Src in TJ dysfunction, respectively. This suggests that Src pathway could be a therapeutic target for BBB protection in epilepsies.", 
    "57": "Therapeutic strategy for cardiac arrhythmias has undergone a remarkable change during the last decades. Currently implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy is considered to be the most effective therapeutic method to treat malignant arrhythmias. Some even argue that there is no room for antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the age of implantable cardioverter defibrillators. However, in clinical practice, antiarrhythmic drug therapies are frequently needed, because implantable cardioverter defibrillators are not effective in certain types of arrhythmias (i.e. premature ventricular beats or atrial fibrillation). Furthermore, given the staggering cost of device therapy, it is economically imperative to develop alternative effective treatments. Cardiac ion channels are the target of a number of current treatment strategies, but therapies based on ion channel blockers only resulted in moderate success. Furthermore, these drugs are associated with an increased risk of proarrhythmia, systemic toxicity, and increased defibrillation threshold. In many cases, certain ion channel blockers were found to increase mortality. Other drug classes such as \u00dfblockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and statins appear to have proven efficacy for reducing cardiac mortality. These facts forced researchers to shift the focus of their research to molecular targets that act upstream of ion channels. One of these potential targets is calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Several lines of evidence converge to suggest that CaMKII inhibition may provide an effective treatment strategy for heart diseases. (1) Recent studies have elucidated that CaMKII plays a key role in modulating cardiac function and regulating hypertrophy development. (2) CaMKII activity has been found elevated in the failing hearts from human patients and animal models. (3) Inhibition of CaMKII activity has been shown to mitigate hypertrophy, prevent functional remodeling and reduce arrhythmogenic activity. In this review, we will discuss the structural and functional properties of CaMKII, the modes of its activation and the functional consequences of CaMKII activity on ion channels.",

This article, detailing treatment of uncomplicated hypertension in diverse populations, represents one of the first large-scale PEP initiatives. The main risk factors for hypertension are age and obesity. Disparities in hypertension risk and outcomes among diverse populations are now believed to be more a function of personal habits, socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors rather than race, ethnicity, or genetics. Blood pressure is controllable in most patients, and all patients should be treated according to best practices. Lifestyle modification, especially diet and exercise, should be encouraged, but most patients will require more than one antihypertensive medication to control blood pressure. Combination therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker plus thiazide-type diuretic or dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is largely universal in efficacy. Improved provider-patient partnership and communication is important to blood pressure lowering success, and cultural sensitivity should be taken into account where applicable.",

We found that ACE activity increased with age and in response to L-NAME and dexamethasone treatment. Ethanol at a dose of 0.4\u00a0g/kg of body weight per day decreased ACE activity in the aorta of aged rats and of rats treated with L-NAME or dexamethasone to the level of activity in young control rats. The optimal ethanol dose (the dose inducing a maximum decrease in ACE activity) increased with increasing doses of dexamethasone: 0.4\u00a0g/kg of body weight per day at 30\u00a0\u03bcg of dexamethasone/kg of body weight and 0.8\u00a0g/kg of body weight per day at 100\u00a0\u03bcg of dexamethasone/kg of body weight. It was also found that optimal doses of ethanol increased the number of cells in the thymus of rats treated with dexamethasone. The optimal dose of ethanol of 0.4\u00a0g/kg of body weight per day, which induced a maximum decrease in ACE activity in rat aorta, corresponded to a dose of 30\u00a0g of ethanol/day, which, according to epidemiological data, produces a maximum decrease in the incidence of cardiovascular disease in humans. In conclusion, the decrease in ACE activity in vessels may be one of the main mechanisms of the beneficial effects of low doses of ethanol on human health.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, on the expression of SR-A in renal tubulointerstitium of diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by injection with streptozotocin. The rats were then randomly divided into 3 groups: normal control group; untreated diabetes mellitus group; and diabetes mellitus group treated with the ACE inhibitor, perindopril. After a 24-week treatment, tubulointerstitial injury index was assessed on Masson's trichrome sections. The number of macrophages and the expression of SR-A protein in renal tubulointerstitium were detected by immunohistochemistry and the expression of SR-A mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The tubulointerstitial injury index, the number of macrophages and the expression of SR-A mRNA were significantly higher in the diabetes group than the normal control group. Perindopril treatment not only attenuated the tubulointerstitial injury and the macrophages infiltration but also reduced the overexpression of SR-A mRNA in diabetic rats. The expression of SR-A protein was most obvious in renal tubulointerstitium in diabetic rats, which was attenuated by perindopril treatment. The findings of the present study indicate that perindopril may have renoprotective effects of diabetic nephropathy via inhibiting the expression of SR-A in renal tubulointerstitium.",

Yet, local renin-angiotensin II systems have been discovered and novel actions of angiotensin II (AngII) have emerged among which its ability to act as a immunomodulator and profibrotic molecule. The enzyme responsible for its synthesis, Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE), is present in high concentrations in lung tissue. In the present paper, we review data from studies of the past decade that implicate AngII and functional polymorphisms of the ACE gene that increase ACE activity with increased susceptibility for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and for pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, drugs that inhibit the synthesis of AngII (ACE inhibitors) or that antagonize its actions on its receptors (Angiotensin II receptor blockers -ARBs) have been shown to provide beneficial effects. Another recent discovery reviewed is the presence of a homologue of ACE, ACE2, which cleaves a single amino acid from AngII and forms a heptapeptide with vasodilatory actions, Ang 1-7. The balance between ACE and ACE2 is crucial for controlling AngII levels.

Since not all patients with hypertension develop left ventricular hypertrophy, there are clinical findings that should be kept in mind that may alert the physician to the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy so a more definitive evaluation can be performed using an echocardiogram or cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Controlling arterial pressure, sodium restriction, and weight loss independently facilitate the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Choice of antihypertensive agents may be important when treating a patient with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers followed by calcium channel antagonists most rapidly facilitate the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. With the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic function and coronary flow reserve usually improve, and cardiovascular risk decreases.",

For this purpose, we used the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test in mice. Additionally, adverse effects of combined treatment with ACE inhibitors and antiepileptic drugs in the passive avoidance task and chimney test were assessed.

Free plasma (non-protein-bound) and total brain concentrations of VPA were not significantly influenced by enalapril. Therefore, the observed interaction could be pharmacodynamic in nature. The combinations of ACE inhibitors with other antiepileptics (CBZ, PHT, and PB) were ineffective in that their ED(50) values against MES were not significantly changed. Enalapril and cilazapril remained ineffective as regards memory retention in the passive avoidance task or motor performance in the chimney test.

At present, given the lack of universally accepted normal values for vascular stiffness as measured by applanation tonometry, serial measurements over time may be more helpful than a single isolated value. In patients with suspected vascular stiffening, therapy should include inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, calcium-channel blockers, and diuretics as needed to normalize blood pressure. \u03b2-Blockers should be reserved for patients with a history of myocardial infarction or congestive heart disease.

Aliskiren increased immunostaining for tissue kallikrein in the heart and reduced cardiac fibrosis. 4. We investigated the mechanism underlying the increase in bradykinin levels following aliskiren treatment in Sprague-Dawley rats, in which aliskiren has a lower potency for renin inhibition. Aliskiren (10 mg/kg per day) reduced renal angiotensin levels within 24 h, but treatment for > 24 h was required to increase cardiac bradykinin levels. Moreover, 3 mg/kg per day aliskiren increased cardiac bradykinin levels, but did not reduce renal angiotensin levels. Aliskiren did not potentiate the hypotensive effects of bradykinin; however, it increased tissue kallikrein, but not plasma kallikrein, mRNA levels in the heart. 5. These data demonstrate that the aliskiren-induced increase in cardiac bradykinin levels is independent of renin inhibition and changes in bradykinin metabolism, but is associated with increased tissue kallikrein gene expression.", 
    "162": "Proteinuria is a common problem encountered in the treatment of renal transplant recipients, occurring in up to 45% of patients. Proteinuria from native kidneys falls rapidly after renal transplantation, and persistent or worsening proteinuria is usually indicative of allograft pathology. Biopsy studies of transplant patients with proteinuria have confirmed that transplant-specific diagnoses (transplant glomerulopathy, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and acute rejection) are more commonly found than other proteinuric conditions, such as glomerulonephritis. As in the nontransplant setting, proteinuria is associated with worse clinical outcomes, including an increased risk for death, cardiovascular events, and graft loss. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers will reduce proteinuria, but the long-term effect of these medications on patient and graft survival remains unknown.",

Main outcomes measured were AKI occurrence, all-cause hospital mortality, and hospital and ICU length of stay.", 
    "165": "Three hundred ninety patients met inclusion criteria, of which 237 (61%) developed AKI. AKI development was independently associated with delay to initiation of adequate antibiotics, intra-abdominal sepsis, blood product transfusion, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker, and body mass index (kg/m\u00b2). Higher baseline GFR and successful early goal directed resuscitation were associated with a decreased risk of AKI. Hospital mortality was significantly greater in patients who developed AKI (49 versus 34%).",

    "167": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in heart failure (HF) patients in randomized-controlled trials; observational studies have confirmed this benefit among patients discharged with HF. Investigating the benefit of ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) among general HF patients has important implications for quality-of-care measurement and quality initiatives. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of receipt of ACEIs/ARBs among patients with HF on hospitalization, emergency care, and healthcare cost during the following year. Using administrative data, we identified HF patients between 2000 and 2005 in a large health plan (n=2,396 patients). We conducted multivariate analysis to assess the impact of receipt of an ACEI/ARB on likelihood of hospitalization and emergency care, and on total healthcare cost. We found that patients who received ACEIs/ARBs were less likely to be hospitalized (odds ratio [OR]=0.82, p<.05) or use emergency care (OR=0.82, p<.05) in the following year. Receipt of ACEIs/ARBs was not associated with significantly increased cost. Incentivizing the receipt of ACEIs/ARBs in a general population with HF may be a suitable target for pay-for-performance programs, disease management programs, or newer complementary frameworks, such as value-based insurance design.",

The principal objective of this study was to screen for the significant variables, and further to optimize the levels of the selected variables, for the enzymatic production of ACE inhibitory peptides from Acetes chinensis.",

The peptic hydrolysis variables were subject to a Plackett-Burman design for screening the main factors. The selected significant parameters such as pH, hydrolysis temperature and enzyme/substrate (E/S) ratio were further optimized using a central composite design. The optimized conditions were: pH 2.5, hydrolysis temperature 45 \u00b0C, E/S ratio 17 800 U kg(-1) shrimp and substrate concentration 200 g L(-1). The results showed that 3-5 h hydrolysis could result in a hydrolysate with ACE inhibition IC(50) of 1.17 mg mL(-1) and a high DH of 25-27%.",

    "171": "Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone synthesized by the adrenal glands that has several regulatory functions to help the body maintain normal volume status and electrolyte balance. Studies have shown significantly higher levels of aldosterone secretion in patients with congestive heart failure compared with normal patients. Elevated levels of aldosterone have been shown to elevate blood pressure, cause left ventricular hypertrophy, and promote cardiac fibrosis. An appreciation of the true role of aldosterone in patients with chronic heart failure did not become apparent until the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study. Until recently, the use of aldosterone receptor antagonists has been limited to patients with severe heart failure and patients with heart failure following myocardial infarction. The Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure (EMPHASIS-HF) study added additional evidence to support the expanded use of aldosterone receptor antagonists in heart failure patients. The results of the EMPHASIS-HF trial showed that patients with mild-to-moderate (New York Heart Association Class II) heart failure had reductions in mortality and hospitalizations from the addition of eplerenone to optimal medical therapy. Evidence remains elusive about the exact mechanism by which aldosterone receptor antagonists improve heart failure morbidity and mortality. The benefits of aldosterone receptor antagonist use in heart failure must be weighed against the potential risk of complications, ie, hyperkalemia and, in the case of spironolactone, possible endocrine abnormalities, in particular gynecomastia. With appropriate monitoring, these risks can be minimized. We now have evidence that patients with mild-to-severe symptoms associated with systolic heart failure will benefit from the addition of an aldosterone receptor antagonist to the standard therapies of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. This review will address the pharmacologic basis of aldosterone receptor antagonists in patients with heart failure and the clinical impact of this therapy.", 
    "172": "In this study, physicochemical scale (P-scale), was recruited as a novel set of physicochemical descriptors derived from component analysis on four short of physicochemical properties variables (hydrophobic, electronic, steric and hydrogen bond contribution) of 20 coded amino acids, By using partial least squares (PLS), we applied P-scale for the study of quantitative structure activity relationship models (QASRs) on three angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides datasets (58 dipeptides, 55 tripeptides, and 50 tetrapeptides).The results of QSARs were superior to that of the earlier studies, with correlation coefficient (r(2)) and cross-validated(q(2)) equal to 0.902, 0.86; 0.985, 0.951 and 0.872, 0.77, respectively. By analysis, hydrophobic and steric properties of ACE-inhibitory peptide sequences play important roles in their bioactivities, and novel peptide sequence could be designed based on these properties of the amino acid residues. These results showed that P-scale descriptors can well represent the peptide sequence. Furthermore, the robust models show that P-scale descriptors can be further expanded for polypeptides and can serve as a useful quantitative tool for the rational drug design and discovery.", 
    "173": "A fair amount of data indicates that bradykinin and lysyl-bradykinin exert arterial, cardiac and renal effects which afford protection against organ damage in diseases, especially in the settings of ischemia or diabetes. The concept of kinins acting as therapeutic agents is supported by the wide use of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These inhibitors indeed potentiate kinin action by inhibiting kinin degradation. Experimental evidence strongly suggests that the cardiac and renal effects of ACE inhibitors are due, at least in part, to kinins. Angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists act also partly through kinins. This paper reviews available evidence supporting a role for kinins in the therapeutic effect of current drugs. It then discusses the opportunity to develop new drugs based on kinin action. Direct activation of the kinin B2 receptor by pharmacological agonists might provide higher therapeutic benefit than existing kinin- potentiating drugs. Possible occurrence of side effects is however a concern.",

    "179": "In this study, the potential of perfusion calorimetry in the characterization of solvates forming isomorphic desolvates was investigated. Perfusion calorimetry was used to expose different hydrates forming isomorphic desolvates (emodepside hydrates II-IV, erythromycin A dihydrate and spirapril hydrochloride monohydrate) to stepwise increasing relative vapour pressures (RVP) of water and methanol, respectively, while measuring thermal activity. Furthermore, the suitability of perfusion calorimetry to distinguish the transformation of a desolvate into an isomorphic solvate from the adsorption of solvent molecules to crystal surfaces as well as from solvate formation that is accompanied by structural rearrangement was investigated. Changes in the samples were confirmed using FT-Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy. Perfusion calorimetry indicates the transformation of a desolvate into an isomorphic solvate by a substantial exothermic, peak-shaped heat flow curve at low RVP which reflects the rapid incorporation of solvent molecules by the desolvate to fill the structural voids in the lattice. In contrast, adsorption of solvent molecules to crystal surfaces is associated with distinctly smaller heat changes whereas solvate formation accompanied by structural changes is characterized by an elongated heat flow. Hence, perfusion calorimetry is a valuable tool in the characterization of solvates forming isomorphic desolvates which represents a new field of application for the method.", 
    "180": "Atherosclerosis leading to cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among western populations. Atherosclerosis in characterised by the development of a fibrofatty lesion that consists of a diverse cell population, including inflammatory cells that create an intensely oxidising environment within the vessel. Coupled with normal replication, the local intracellular and extracellular environment causes damage to cellular DNA that is recognised and repaired by the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. The role of DNA damage and the resulting deregulation of 'normal' cellular behaviour and subsequent loss of cell cycle control checkpoints have been widely studied in cancer. However, despite the extensive evidence for DNA damage in atherosclerosis, it is only over the past two decades that a causative link between DNA damage and atherosclerosis has been hypothesised. Whilst atherosclerosis is a feature of human disease characterised by defects in DNA damage, currently the role of DNA damage in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis remains highly debated, as a 'chicken and egg' situation. This review will analyse the evidence for, the causes of, and consequences of DNA damage in atherosclerosis, detail the DNA damage response pathway that results in these consequences, and highlight therapeutic opportunities in this area. We also outline the evidence that DNA damage is a cause of both initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, and not just a consequence of disease.",

Repurposing of safe, older drugs provides a lower risk alternative. Vascular protection is a novel strategy for improving stroke outcome. Promising targets for vascular protection after stroke have been identified, and several of these targets can be approached with \"repurposed\" old drugs, including statins, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and minocycline. We tested the vascular protection (ability to reduce hemorrhagic transformation) of three marketed drugs (candesartan, minocycline, and atorvastatin) in the experimental stroke model using three different rat strains [Wistar, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats]. All agents decreased the infarct size, improved the neurological outcome and decreased bleeding. Mechanisms identified include inhibition of MMP-9, activation of Akt, and increased expression of proangiogenic growth factors. Premorbid vascular damage (presence of either diabetes or hypertension) increased the likelihood of vascular injury after ischemia and reperfusion and improved the response to vascular protection.",

    "195": "The activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) of the inner surface (the endothelium surface) of rat aorta sections has been studied depending on their distance from the aortic arch, age of rats, and the duration of treatment of rats with the NO synthase inhibitor, N (\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME). The activity of ACE of aorta sections was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine and was expressed as picomoles of Hip-His-Leu hydrolyzed per minute per square millimeter of the endothelium surface. It was found that the ACE activity considerably varies along the aorta of young rats. This variability decreases with increasing age of rats and by the action of L-NAME. The average ACE activity in the aorta increases with the age of rats and with increasing time of L-NAME treatment. Enalapril normalizes the distribution of the ACE activity along the aorta and decreases the average ACE activity. The changes in the distribution of the ACE activity along the aorta and in the average ACE activity in the aorta with increasing age of the rat and by the action of L-NAME may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis of vessels on aging and the inhibition of formation of nitric oxide.",

We hypothesized that late-life low-dose (non-blood-pressure-lowering) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition vs. angiotensin II receptor blockade would be equally efficacious at mitigating diastolic dysfunction in the senescent Fischer 344\u2009\u00d7\u2009Brown Norway rat. Enalapril (10\u00a0mg/kg/day; n\u2009=\u20099) initiated at 24\u00a0months of age and continued for 6\u00a0months, increased myocardial relaxation (e'), reduced Doppler-derived indices of filling pressure (E/e'), favorably lowered the ratio of phospholamban-SERCA2 and reduced oxidative stress markers, Rac1 and nitrotyrosine, in aged hearts.

    "197": "Captopril (CAP) was the first angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to be developed and is widely used in hypertension treatment. On the other hand, cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides whose cone-shaped cavity allows formation of noncovalent inclusion complexes with appropriately sized guest molecules, thus modifying guest physical, chemical, and biological properties. Herein, the physicochemical characterization and in vivo ACE inhibition evaluation of seven CAP/CD complexes are reported. The inclusion complexes were prepared by spray-drying, freeze-drying, kneading, or lyophilization methods and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. In vivo assays compared CAP and CAP/CD complex administration (0.5 mg kg(-1) or 0.09 mg kg(-1), n = 4-7) to evaluate the ACE inhibition by continuous infusion of angiotensin I (30 ng 50 \u03bcL(-1) min(-1)) in conscious Wistar rats. The physicochemical analysis demonstrated complete amorphization and complexation between CAP and CDs, indicating the substitution of water molecules inside the CD cavity with CAP. During the infusion of angiotensin I, the administration of all CAP/CD complexes induced a reduction in mean arterial pressure similar to that observed upon CAP administration. The nanoparticles obtained by the kneading method (CAP/\u03b1-CD:KM) showed a potent and long-lasting inhibitory activity (\u223c22 hours) on the angiotensin I pressor effect. The results suggest that the inclusion complex of CAP and \u03b1-CD can function as a novel antihypertensive formulation that may improve therapeutic use of CAP by reducing its oral dose administration to once per day, thus providing better quality of life for almost 25% of the world's population who suffer from hypertension.", 
    "198": "Infusion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat into fetal sheep caused a profound arterial hypotension within days. Five fetal lambs were infused with enalaprilat for 8 days starting at day 128 of gestation. Total accumulated dose was 0.30 \u00b1 0.11 mg/kg. Arterial pressure decreased from 43.6 to 25.6 mmHg; venous pressure did not change. Biventricular output was not statistically significantly changed; placental blood flow decreased almost in proportion to the decrease in pressure but the increase in somatic flow was not statistically significant. There were no significant changes in pressure 30 min after the initial 50-\u03bcg loading dose of enalaprilat. However, the arterial pressure responses to test doses of ANG I were largely abolished. After 1 day, however, there was a significant decrease in somatic vascular resistance, which became stronger with time, but almost no decrease in the placental resistance. We conclude that the fetal somatic circulation exhibits a slow but strong decrease in resistance but that the response to hypotension is weak or absent in the fetal placenta, possibly because it is already fully relaxed.", 
    "199": "We previously reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) renoprotection in Munich Wistar Fr\u00f6mter (MWF) rats, which develop progressive glomerular injury, was associated with podocyte repopulation and preservation of glomerular architecture. Here, we studied the time course of the lesions, their cellular components, and the effect of ACEi. Early glomerular lesions were synechiae, followed by extracapillary crescents and glomerulosclerosis. The majority of cells forming crescents were claudin1(+) parietal epithelial cells and, to a lesser extent, WT1(+) podocytes, both in active proliferation. In crescents, cells expressing the metanephric mesenchyme marker NCAM were also found. Three distinct populations of parietal epithelial cells were identified in the rat Bowman's capsule: NCAM(+)WT1(-) cells, also expressing progenitor cell marker CD24, and NCAM(+)WT1(+) and NCAM(-)WT1(+) cells, the latter population representing parietal podocytes. After exposure to inductive medium, cultured parietal epithelial cells that were obtained by capsulated glomeruli generated podocytes, documenting their progenitor nature. Mitotic activity of cultured renal progenitors was induced by angiotensin II through the down-regulation of cell cycle inhibitor C/EBP\u03b4 expression. Treatment with ACEi reduced number and extension of crescents and glomerulosclerosis in MWF rats. Renoprotection was accomplished through the limitation of NCAM(+) progenitor proliferation via the modulation of C/EBP\u03b4. Thus, chaotic migration and proliferation of the Bowman's capsule progenitor cells pave the way to crescent formation and subsequent sclerosis. ACEi, by moderating progenitor cell activation, restores glomerular architecture and prevents renal disease progression.",

In the ACCOMPLISH trial, CV outcomes and renoprotective effects were greater in patients receiving benazepril in combination with amlodipine; the GUARD trial demonstrated that combined benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide was more effective than amlodipine combined with benazepril in reducing baseline urinary albumin:creatinine ratio and normalizing urinary albumin:creatinine ratio in patients with baseline microalbuminuria, although this effect was accompanied with a greater decrease in glomerular filtration rate than with benazepril/amlodipine.

Patients were characterized with raised weight index (WI), arterial hypertension, increased concentration of triglycerides in blood serum, of glucose, of HbAlc level and S-peptide, and also high level of endotelin (1-38) and CD32+CD40+circulating particles of endothelium. Three months treatment lead to decrease in WI, arterial pressure, triglycerides concentration, HbAlc, glucose, except CD32+CD40+. Six months treatment lead to more expressed positive dynamics. Thus, metformin and ramipril combination in patients with MS leads to decrease in insulin resistancy, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism normalization, to restoration of endothelium functions that is possible to consider as prophylaxis of the development of type 2 diabetes melitus and its cardiovascular complications.",

As neonicotinoid insecticides persist in crops, biotransformation of these insecticides represents a promising approach for improving the safety of foods. Here, the elimination of ACE from a liquid medium by the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624 was examined. Under ligninolytic and non-ligninolytic conditions, 45% and 30% of ACE were eliminated, respectively, after 15 days of incubation. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of a metabolite identified in the culture supernatant suggested that ACE was N-demethylated to (E)-N (1)-[(6-chloro-3-pyridyl)-methyl]-N (2)-cyano-acetamidine, which has a much lower toxicity than ACE. In addition, we investigated the effect of the cytochrome P450 inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PB) on the elimination of ACE. The elimination rate of ACE by P. sordida YK-624 was markedly reduced by the addition of either 0.01 or 0.1 mM PB to the culture medium.

Since the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) are also enhanced in VSMC from SHR, the present study was undertaken to examine the role of enhanced levels of endogenous Ang II in the overexpression of Gi\u03b1 proteins in VSMC from SHR and to further explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increase. The enhanced expression of Gi\u03b1-2 and Gi\u03b1-3 proteins in VSMC from SHR compared to WKY was attenuated by the captopril, losartan and AG1478, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, AT(1) receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respectively as well as by the siRNAs of AT1, cSrc and EGFR. The enhanced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by low concentrations of GTP\u03b3S (receptor-independent functions) and of inhibitory responses of hormones on adenylyl cyclase activity (receptor-dependent functions) in VSMC from SHR was also attenuated by losartan. Furthermore, the enhanced phosphorylation of EGFR in VSMC from SHR was also restored to control levels by captopril, losartan, PP2, a c-Src inhibitor and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) scavenger, whereas enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was attenuated by captopril and losartan. Furthermore, NAC also restored the enhanced phosphorylation of c-Src in SHR to control levels. These results suggest that the enhanced levels of endogenous Ang II in VSMC from SHR, transactivate EGFR, which through MAP kinase signaling, enhance the expression of Gi\u03b1 proteins and associated adenylyl cyclase signaling.",

We computed odds-ratios and dose response effects for AD, vascular and unspecified/other dementia, comparing those prescribed ARBs or ACE-Is for at least six months with patients prescribed other anti-hypertensives. We controlled for matching factors, co-morbidities, smoking status, an area measure of socioeconomic status, consultation rate and blood pressure and accounted for reverse causality by introducing time-lags of up to eight years prior to diagnosis/index date. Patients diagnosed with AD, vascular and unspecified/other dementia had fewer prescriptions for ARBs and ACE-Is. Inverse associations with AD were strongest for ARBs (odds-ratio; 0.47, 95%CI, 0.37-0.58) compared with ACE-Is (odds-ratio; 0.76, 95%CI, 0.69-0.84) (p(difference) < 0.001). Associations of ARBs with AD were stronger than for vascular dementia (p(difference) = 0.01) and unspecified/other dementia (p(difference) = 0.23). There were inverse dose-response relationships between ARBs and ACE-Is with AD (both p(trend) < 0.01). The inverse association of ACE-Is with AD diminished when using longer time lags but the ARB-AD association persisted. Patients with AD were around half as likely to be prescribed ARBs.

This Review analyses the new therapeutic targets (for example, ventricular remodelling, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, defects in Ca(2+) cycling, and so on), the mechanism of action, efficacy and future perspectives of new drugs that are currently under development for the treatment of heart failure, and the possible explanations for the discrepancy between Phase II and Phase III trials.", 
    "263": "We investigated the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril in a clinically relevant ovine model of smoke and burn injury, with special reference to oxidative stress and activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, in the lung and in circulating leukocytes. Female, adult sheep (28-40 kg) were divided into three groups. After tracheostomy and under deep anesthesia, both vehicle-control-treated (n = 5) and captopril-treated (20 mg/kg per day, i.v., starting 0.5 h before the injury) (n = 5) groups were subjected to 2 \u00d7 20%, third-degree burn injury and were insufflated with 48 breaths of cotton smoke. A sham group not receiving burn/smoke was also studied (n = 5). Animals were mechanically ventilated and fluid resuscitated for 24 h in the awake state. Burn and smoke injury resulted in an upregulation of ACE in the lung, evidenced by immunohistochemical determination and Western blotting. Burn and smoke injury resulted in pulmonary dysfunction, as well as systemic hemodynamic alterations. Captopril treatment of burn and smoke animals improved PaO2/FiO2 ratio and pulmonary shunt fraction and reduced the degree of lung edema. There was a marked increase in PAR levels in circulating leukocytes after burn/smoke injury, which was significantly decreased by captopril. The pulmonary level of ACE and the elevated pulmonary levels of transforming growth factor \u03b2 in response to burn and smoke injury were significantly decreased by captopril treatment. Our results suggest that the ACE inhibitor captopril exerts beneficial effects on the pulmonary function in burn/smoke injury. The effects of the ACE inhibitor may be related to the prevention of reactive oxygen species-induced poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase overactivation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may also exert additional beneficial effects by inhibiting the expression of the profibrotic mediator transforming growth factor \u03b2.",

    "268": "The blockade of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) with GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol induces robust hypertonic NaCl and water intake by rats. In the present study we investigated the effects of previous injections of losartan (AT(1) angiotensin receptor antagonist) into the LPBN on 0.3M NaCl and water intake induced by muscimol injected bilaterally in the same area in fluid replete rats and in rats treated with the diuretic furosemide combined with a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril injected subcutaneously. Male Wistar rats with stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN were used. Bilateral injections of muscimol (0.5 nmol/0.2 \u03bcl, n=8) into the LPBN in fluid replete rats induced 0.3M NaCl intake (23.4\u00b14.1 vs. saline: 0.4\u00b10.4 ml/3h) and water intake (9.3\u00b11.9 vs. saline: 0.7\u00b10.4 ml/3h) and pre-treatment of the LPBN with losartan (50 \u03bcg/0.2 \u03bcl) reduced 0.3M NaCl intake (3.3\u00b12.5 ml/3h) and water intake (4.0\u00b12.9 ml/3h) induced by muscimol. In rats treated with furosemide+captopril, pre-treatment with losartan into the LPBN attenuated the increase of 0.3M NaCl intake produced by muscimol (12.8\u00b15.3, vs. saline+muscimol: 36.7\u00b16.7 ml/3h) without changing water intake. Therefore, the results suggest that deactivation of LPBN inhibitory mechanisms by muscimol injections into the LPBN is facilitated by endogenous angiotensin II acting on AT(1) receptors in the LPBN, which drives rats to ingest large amounts of hypertonic NaCl.",

The current study was an open-label prospective study. Hypertensive patients with no history of cardiovascular disease who had not met their blood pressure (BP) goals with CCB treatment were administered perindopril and followed for 6 months. Both home and office BP were significantly lowered by perindopril administration. The morning/evening (M/E) ratios calculated from home BP were 1.31 and 1.05 for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively. When the patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of an anti-hypertensive response, urinary albumin excretion, and cardio ankle vascular index were significantly reduced by perindopril administration in all the subjects, irrespective of the presence or absence of anti-hypertensive reaction. In low-risk hypertensive patients, perindopril improves renal and vascular function probably via its persistent anti-hypertensive effects and the concomitant effects of CCB.",

We evaluated whether the Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) contributes to neural mechanisms of blood pressure (BP) regulation. We microinjected Ang-(1-7), Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor antagonist A-779, and ACE2 inhibitor DX600 into the RVLM of anesthetized Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Unilateral Ang-(1-7) microinjection induced a significantly greater increase in AP (arterial blood pressure) in SHR than in WKY. Bilateral A-779 microinjection induced a significantly greater decrease in AP and renal sympathetic nerve activity in SHR than in WKY. Bilateral DX600 microinjection induced a significantly greater decrease in AP in SHR than in WKY. Our results suggest that endogenous Ang-(1-7) in the RVLM contributes to maintain AP and renal sympathetic nerve activity both in SHR and WKY and that its activity might be enhanced in SHR.",

The doses of RAS-Is used for patients in the no-\u03b2-blocker group were at least double those used in the \u03b2-blocker group. No significant differences between the 2 groups were observed with regard to baseline characteristics. After a 12-month follow-up, the survival and cardiac event-free rates in the \u03b2-blocker group were significantly higher than those in the no-\u03b2-blocker group. The percent change in blood pressure did not significantly differ between the 2 groups, but the levels of brain natriuretic peptide, metalloproteinase-2, and metalloproteinase-9 and the left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly in the \u03b2-blocker group compared with the no-\u03b2-blocker group.

    "279": "Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic dietary salt loading causes hypertension and a decreased sensitivity of the systemic vasculature to \u03b1-adrenergic stimulation and other hypertensive stimuli (e.g. hypercapnia) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This reduced sensitivity to hypertensive stimuli is consistent with a possible blunting of homeostatic responses normally aimed at raising blood pressure. To test this idea, we examined the consequences of long-term salt feeding and the associated hypertension on the interactive capacities of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and adrenergic systems to elevate blood pressure in trout. Secretion of catecholamines in response to a range of doses of homologous ANG II in vivo and in situ (using a perfused posterior cardinal vein preparation) was reduced in the salt-fed fish. The reduced sensitivity to ANG II could not be explained by alterations in stored catecholamine (adrenaline or noradrenaline) levels or the general responsiveness of the chromaffin cells to depolarizing stimuli (60 mmol/l KCl). Despite the decreased responsiveness of the chromaffin cells to ANG II, plasma catecholamines were increased to a greater extent in the salt-fed fish during acute hypoxia (a condition that activates the RAS). Interestingly, the pressor effects of ANG II in vivo were actually heightened in the salt-fed fish. The increased pressor response to exogenous ANG II was likely attributable to its direct interaction with vascular ANG II receptors because the effect persisted even after blockade of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors. Treating fish with the vascular smooth muscle relaxant papaverine caused similar reductions in blood pressure and increases in plasma ANG II levels regardless of diet. Similarly, inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with lisinopril reduced blood pressure equally in control and salt-fed fish. These results indicate that, while long-term dietary salt loading blunts the response of trout chromaffin cells to ANG II, the RAS itself appears to be unaffected. Indeed, the capacity of ANG II to elevate blood pressure is not compromised nor do fish exhibit a reduced capacity to mount an acute humoral adrenergic stress response during acute hypoxia.", 
    "280": "Raised levels of blood pressure result from the complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors. The complexity of blood pressure control mechanisms has major implications for individual responsiveness to antihypertensive drugs. The underlying haemodynamic disorder in the majority of cases is a rise in peripheral vascular resistance. This observation led to the discovery and development of increasingly sophisticated and targeted vasodilators, although many of the earlier antihypertensive drugs, by virtue of their actions blocking the sympathetic nervous system, had a vasodilator component to their mode of action. A recent meta-analysis of placebo controlled trials of monotherapy in unselected hypertensives, reports average (placebo-corrected) blood pressure responses to single agents of 9.1 mmHg systolic and 5.5 mmHg diastolic pressure. These average values disguise the extremely wide ranging responses in individuals across a fall of 20-30 mmHg systolic at one extreme, to no effect at all, or even a small rise in blood pressure at the other. The second factor determining individual responses to monotherapy is the extent to which initial falls in pressure are opposed by reflex responses in counter regulatory mechanisms that are activated following the blood pressure reduction. Thus, a satisfactory blood pressure response is rarely reached with monotherapy alone. What then is the next step if blood pressure is not a goal after the patient has been treated with monotherapy for a few weeks? Should you uptitrate, substitute or combine?",

    "293": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of heart failure and cardiorenal interaction. Drugs interfering in the RAAS form the pillars in treatment of heart failure and cardiorenal syndrome. Although RAAS inhibitors improve prognosis, heart failure-associated morbidity and mortality remain high, especially in the presence of kidney disease. The effect of RAAS blockade may be limited due to the loss of an inhibitory feedback of angiotensin II on renin production. The subsequent increase in prorenin and renin may activate several alternative pathways. These include the recently discovered (pro-) renin receptor, angiotensin II escape via chymase and cathepsin, and the formation of various angiotensin subforms upstream from the blockade, including angiotensin 1-7, angiotensin III, and angiotensin IV. Recently, the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren has been proven effective in reducing plasma renin activity (PRA) and appears to provide additional (tissue) RAAS blockade on top of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin receptor blockers, underscoring the important role of renin, even (or more so) under adequate RAAS blockade. Reducing PRA however occurs at the expense of an increase plasma renin concentration (PRC). PRC may exert direct effects independent of PRA through the recently discovered (pro-) renin receptor. Additional novel possibilities to interfere in the RAAS, for instance using vitamin D receptor activation, as well as the increased knowledge on alternative pathways, have revived the question on how ideal RAAS-guided therapy should be implemented. Renin and prorenin are pivotal since these are at the base of all of these pathways.", 
    "294": "The challenge of managing hypertension is exemplified by the limited success of monotherapy and necessity for multiple drug regimens targeting complimentary pathways. Recent evidence suggests that combination therapy including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) provides blood pressure control while reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity over ACE inhibitor/diuretic therapy. However, CCBs, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers all increase plasma renin activity (PRA), promoting angiotensin I accumulation and angiotensin II production through alternative pathways. While the clinical ramifications of this and other compensatory pathways activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are unclear, the recently approved aliskiren/amlodipine antihypertensive combination pill has been shown to decrease PRA via aliskiren's direct inhibition of renin. The purpose of this monograph is to review the mechanisms of action, pharmacodynamics, and safety and efficacy profile of the aliskiren/amlodipine combination pill.", 
    "295": "Patients with chronic renal disease are at increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease, which is the main cause of death in this growing population. Among the risk factors involved, hypertension and proteinuria are major contributors to kidney damage and, if not controlled, may eventually lead to the progression of renal failure and end-stage renal disease. Both proteinuria and hypertension can be primary pathologic events or can appear as complications of other disease processes. Initially, these two factors may operate separately but, as progression ensues, both processes generally combine, potentiating their effects and hastening renal damage. Therefore, strategies to reduce blood pressure and proteinuria are essential in order to slow the worsening of many nephropathies. Therapies that target the renin-angiotensin system offer particular benefit, as hypertension and proteinuria can be precisely reduced with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers. However, with this intervention, plasma renin activity remains high, and although primary endpoints may be controlled, elevated renin concentration can contribute to cardiovascular damage. Aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, is the first example of a novel class of antihypertensive drugs with potent antiproteinuric effects, which, alone or combined, can contribute to delaying the progression of kidney disease.", 
    "296": "Dysphagia induces silent aspiration, which is a known risk factor for aspiration pneumonia in the elderly. Dysphagia is associated with impaired substance P secretion. Because nicergoline was recently reported to enhance substance P secretion, it may improve dysphagia by upregulating substance P; however, roles for nicergoline in this process have not been demonstrated. We therefore compared the effects of nicergoline on serum substance P and dysphagia with the effects of imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor whose efficacy in improving dysphagia and preventing pneumonia has been previously demonstrated.We randomly assigned 60 elderly patients with both dysphagia and a previous history of pneumonia to receive either imidapril (5 mg/d; n = 30) or nicergoline (15 mg/d; n = 30) for 6 months. Primary outcomes were the effects of these drugs on the substance P level and dysphagia 4 weeks after the start of treatment. Secondary outcome was the effect of these drugs on pneumonia recurrence during the 6 months of treatment.Significant elevations of serum substance P were obtained by both medications after 4 weeks of treatment. Patients whose dysphagia was improved showed significantly increased serum levels of substance P. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall proportion of patients who showed improvements in dysphagia and pneumonia recurrence with imidapril or nicergoline treatment. Nicergoline, but not imidapril, seemed to be more effective at improving dysphagia and elevating serum substance P in patients with dementia.In conclusion, nicergoline has a comparable effect to ACE inhibitors for improving dysphagia. Nicergoline might be a novel regimen for the treatment of dysphagia in the elderly who are not treatable with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "297": "The progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely independent of the underlying kidney disorder once renal function has fallen below a critical level. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for disease progression in both adult and pediatric patients with kidney disorders. Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that the rate of CKD progression can be lowered by pharmacological interventions. Nephroprotective strategies currently focus on the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers provide efficient control not only of blood pressure, but also of proteinuria, an effect associated with improved long-term nephroprotection compared with other antihypertensive drug classes. In addition, evidence for an additional nephroprotective advantage of tight blood-pressure control towards the low-normal range in young patients and patients with proteinuria is emerging. In this Review, we describe the role of hypertension in CKD and discuss the therapeutic principle of the prevention of CKD progression with antihypertensive agents.",

A dose-dependent reduction of superoxide anion production was observed by dihydroethidium staining in tibialis anterior muscle of enalapril-treated mice, approaching the effect observed with PND. In parallel, a significant reduction of the activated form of the pro-inflammatory Nuclear Factor-kB has been observed in gastrocnemious muscle. Histologically, 5 mg/kg enalapril reduced the area of muscle necrosis in both gastrocnemious muscle and diaphragm, without significant effect on non-muscle area. In parallel no significant changes have been observed in both muscle TGF-\u03b21 and myonuclei positive to phosphorylated Smad2/3. Myofiber functional indices were also monitored by microelectrodes recordings. A dose-dependent recovery of macroscopic chloride conductance has been observed upon enalapril treatment in EDL muscle, with minor effects being exerted in diaphragm. However a modest effect, if any, was found on mechanical threshold, a functional index of calcium homeostasis. No recovery was observed in creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Finally the results suggest the ability of enalapril to blunt angiotensin-II dependent activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways which may be earlier events with respect to the pro-fibrotic ones, and may in part account for both functional impairment and muscle necrosis. The PDN-like profile may corroborate the combined use of the two classes of drugs in DMD patients so to potentiate the beneficial effects at skeletal muscle level, while reducing both spontaneous and PDN-aggravated cardiomyopathy.",

    "311": "HMO physicians were notified that losartan would no longer require PA, and appropriate changes were made to the electronic prescribing computer program. The monthly distribution by drug of the number of prescriptions for ARBs dispensed for new patients was calculated before and after the policy change from data captured from electronic records. The proportion of patients (percentage and 95% confidence interval) treated with losartan who met the criteria for treatment with ARBs (hypertension or cardiac insufficiency in patients who have developed adverse effects in response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or macroproteinuria) during the first month after the PA requirement was rescinded was calculated.",

    "314": "In patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) without overt heart failure, ACE inhibitors are among the most commonly used drugs as these agents have been proven effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Considerable individual variations in the blood pressure response to ACE inhibitors are observed and as such heterogeneity in clinical treatment effect would be likely as well. Assessing the consistency of treatment benefit is essential for the rational and cost-effective prescription of ACE inhibitors. Information on heterogeneities in treatment effect between subgroups of patients could be used to develop an evidence-based guidance for the installation of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Obviously, therapy should only be applied in those patients who most likely will benefit. Attempts to develop such treatment guidance by using clinical characteristics have been unsuccessful. No heterogeneity in risk reduction by ACE inhibitors has been observed in relation to relevant clinical characteristics. A new approach to such 'guided-therapy' could be to integrate more patient-specific characteristics such as the patients' genetic information. If proven feasible, pharmacogenetic profiling could optimise patients' benefit of treatment and reduce unnecessary treatment of patients. Cardiovascular pharmacogenetic research of ACE inhibitors in coronary artery disease patients is in a formative stage and studies are limited. The PERGENE study is a large pharmacogenetic substudy of the EUROPA trial, aimed to assess the achievability of pharmacogenetic profiling. We provide an overview of the main results of the PERGENE study in terms of the genetic determinants of treatment benefit and blood pressure response. The main results of the PERGENE study show a pharmacogenetic profile related to the treatment benefit of perindopril identifying responders and non-responders to treatment.", 
    "315": "Renin inhibitors are antihypertensive drugs that block the first step in the renin-angiotensin system. Their mechanism of action differs from that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor antagonists, but like these drugs, renin inhibitors interrupt the negative feedback effects of angiotensin II on renin secretion. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has long been recognized to play a significant role in hypertension pathophysiology. Certain agents that modify the RAAS can control blood pressure and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Optimization of this compound by Novartis led to the development of aliskiren - the only direct renin inhibitor which is clinically used as an antihypertensive drug. Aliskiren is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents. Aliskiren is a new renin inhibitor of a novel structural class that has recently been shown to be efficacious in hypertensive patients after once-daily oral dosing. In short-term studies, it was effective in lowering blood pressure either alone or in combination with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide, and had a low incidence of serious adverse effects. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 for the use as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensives. Greater reductions in blood pressure have been achieved when aliskiren was used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or an angiotensin-receptor blocker. The most common adverse effects reported in clinical trials were headache, fatigue, dizziness, diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis. Aliskiren has not been studied in patients with moderate renal dysfunction; as an RAAS-acting drug, it should be prescribed for such patients only with caution.", 
    "316": "The nearly one-million estimated adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients in the United States now outnumber children with congenital heart disease (CHD). With continued improvement in survival due to surgical and medical management of patients born with CHD, there is an overall shift in the burden of care from childhood to adulthood. Due to this transitioning population, the probability of heart failure continues to increase with age and represents nearly one-quarter of all mortality in ACHD. Despite these sobering figures adult cardiologist and fellows continue to have limited exposure in the care of patients with congenital heart disease. The syndrome of heart failure represents a complex derangement of neurohormones, natriuretic peptides, and cytokines leading to progressive symptoms of exercise intolerance, dyspnea, and fatigue. Congenital heart patients represent a unique challenge in both categorization and protocol management of heart failure (HF). It remains unclear if the current four-stage ACC/AHA guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of HF in adults can serve as a meaningful framework for congenital heart patients. Additionally, widely used conventional HF therapy of beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) have not demonstrated clear survival benefit in this population. Unfortunately, adequately powered and controlled randomized studies are grossly lacking and remain challenging to conduct. Nonetheless, a review of heart failure associated with ACHD is provided.", 
    "317": "Activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), production of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] and stimulation of the Ang-(1-7) receptor Mas exert beneficial actions in various peripheral cardiovascular diseases, largely through opposition of the deleterious effects of angiotensin II via its type 1 receptor. Here we considered the possibility that Ang-(1-7) may exert beneficial effects against CNS damage and neurological deficits produced by cerebral ischaemic stroke. We determined the effects of central administration of Ang-(1-7) or pharmacological activation of ACE2 on the cerebral damage and behavioural deficits elicited by endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), a model of cerebral ischaemia. The results of the present study demonstrated that intracerebroventricular infusion of either Ang-(1-7) or an ACE2 activator, diminazine aceturate (DIZE), prior to and following ET-1-induced MCAO significantly attenuated the cerebral infarct size and neurological deficits measured 72 h after the insult. These beneficial actions of Ang-(1-7) and DIZE were reversed by co-intracerebroventricular administration of the Mas receptor inhibitor, A-779. Neither the Ang-(1-7) nor the DIZE treatments altered the reduction in cerebral blood flow elicited by ET-1. Lastly, intracerebroventricular administration of Ang-(1-7) significantly reduced the increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression within the cerebral infarct that occurs following ET-1-induced MCAO. This is the first demonstration of cerebroprotective properties of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis during ischaemic stroke, and suggests that the mechanism of the Ang-(1-7) protective action includes blunting of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression.", 
    "318": "Hypotension in aryl hydrocarbon receptor knockout mice (ahr(-/-)) is mediated, in part, by a reduced contribution of angiotensin (Ang) II to basal blood pressure (BP). Since AHR is highly expressed in endothelial cells (EC), we hypothesized that EC-specific ahr(-/-) (ECahr(-/-)) mice would exhibit a similar phenotype. We generated ECahr(-/-) mice by crossing AHR floxed mice (ahr(fx/fx)) to mice expressing Cre recombinase driven by an EC-specific promoter. BP was assessed by radiotelemetry prior to and following an acute injection of Ang II or chronic treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). ECahr(-/-) mice were hypotensive (ECahr(+/+): 116.1\u00b11.4; ECahr(-/-): 107.4\u00b12.0 mmHg, n=11, p<0.05) and exhibited significantly different responses to Ang II and ACEi. While Ang II increased BP in both genotypes, the increase was sustained in ECahr(+/+), whereas the increase in ECahr(-/-) mice steadily declined. Area under the curve analysis showed that Ang II-induced increase in diastolic BP (DBP) over 30 min was significantly lower in ECahr(-/-) mice (ECahr(+/+) 1297\u00b1223 mmHg/30 min; ECahr(-/-)(AUC): 504\u00b1138 mmHg/30 min, p<0.05). In contrast, while ACEi decreased BP in both genotypes, the subsequent rise in DBP after treatment was significantly delayed in the ECahr(-/-) mice. ECahr(-/-) mice also exhibited reduced vascular and adipose Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression, and reduced aortic Ang II-dependent vasoconstriction in the presence of vascular adipose. Taken together these data suggest that hypotension in ECahr(-/-) mice results from reduced vascular responsiveness to Ang II that is influenced by AT1R expression and adipose.",

    "323": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a much higher risk of cardiovascular diseases than the general population. Endothelial dysfunction, which participates in accelerated atherosclerosis, is a hallmark of CKD. Patients with CKD display impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, elevated soluble biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress. They also present an imbalance between circulating endothelial populations reflecting endothelial injury (endothelial microparticles and circulating endothelial cells) and repair (endothelial progenitor cells). Endothelial damage induced by a uremic environment suggests an involvement of uremia-specific factors. Several uremic toxins, mostly protein-bound, have been shown to have specific endothelial toxicity: ADMA, homocysteine, AGEs, and more recently, p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate. These toxins, all poorly removed by hemodialysis therapies, share mechanisms of endothelial toxicity: they promote pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory response and inhibit endothelial repair. This article (i) reviews the evidence for endothelial dysfunction in CKD, (ii) specifies the involvement of protein-bound uremic toxins in this dysfunction, and (iii) discusses therapeutic strategies for lowering uremic toxin concentrations or for countering the effects of uremic toxins on the endothelium.", 
    "324": "Patients on chronic dialysis therapy have a dramatic excess cardiovascular risk compared to any other population, including those with overt diabetic nephropathy. Despite this, patients on dialysis are almost invariably excluded from trials evaluating the cardioprotective effect of novel treatments. Consistent evidence is available that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), are more cardioprotective than other antihypertensive agents in patients with chronic renal disease or diabetes (with or without renal involvement), but whether this applies also to patients on dialysis is unknown. However, clear evidence is available that ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce morbidity and mortality in patients on dialysis with heart failure (HF) or atrial fibrillation (AF). Moreover, these drugs may preserve residual renal function in those with preterminal kidney failure as well as vascular access and peritoneal membrane function in those on extracorporeal or peritoneal dialysis, respectively. These drugs also show an excellent tolerability profile in this population. Thus, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are indicated in patients on dialysis with HF or AF. Available evidence suggests that they should be first-choice therapy in patients on dialysis with hypertension, though trials are still needed to formally demonstrate their superior cardioprotective effect over other antihypertensives in this population.",

The vascular system is a prototypical aging tissue, and arterial stiffness plays a major role in hypertension as the individual ages. Some unique aging changes in the nitric oxide and angiotensin II pathways are particularly important for vascular aging. Studies focusing on direct measures of vascular stiffness have increased understanding of the pathophysiology behind increased arterial stiffness. Goal blood pressure in the elderly is debated, but based on current outcome data, a goal blood pressure of 150/80-90\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg is reasonable in at least the very elderly. This review discusses in detail the various landmark hypertension studies in the elderly.

Yet the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of DN are not fully defined, partially due to lack of suitable models that mimic the complex pathogenesis of renal disease in diabetic patients. In this study, we describe early and late renal manifestations of DN and renal responses to long-term treatments with rosiglitazone or high-dose enalapril in ZSF1 rats, a model of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and chronic renal disease. At 8 weeks of age, obese ZSF1 rats developed metabolic syndrome and diabetes (hyperglycemia, glucosuria, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension) and early signs of renal disease (proteinuria, glomerular collagen IV deposition, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and renal hypertrophy). By 32 weeks of age, animals developed renal histopathology consistent with DN, including mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis, tubular dilation and atrophy, and arteriolar thickening. Rosiglitazone markedly increased body weight but reduced food intake, improved glucose control, and attenuated hyperlipidemia and liver and kidney injury. In contrast, rosiglitazone markedly increased cardiac hypertrophy via a blood pressure-independent mechanism. High-dose enalapril did not improve glucose homeostasis, but normalized blood pressure, and nearly prevented diabetic renal injury. The ZSF1 model thus detects the clinical observations seen with rosiglitazone and enalapril in terms of primary and secondary endpoints of cardiac and renal effects. This and previous reports indicate that the obese ZSF1 rat meets currently accepted criteria for progressive experimental diabetic renal disease in rodents, suggesting that this may be the best available rat model for simulation of human DN.",

Telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), acts as a partial PPAR\u03b3 agonist. We hypothesized that telmisartan protects against diabetic vascular complications, through PPAR\u03b3 activation. We compared the effects of telmisartan, telmisartan combined with GW9662 (a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist), and losartan with no PPAR\u03b3 activity on vascular injury in obese type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Compared to losartan, telmisartan significantly ameliorated vascular endothelial dysfunction, downregulation of phospho-eNOS, and coronary arterial remodeling in db/db mice. More vascular protective effects of telmisartan than losartan were associated with greater anti-inflammatory effects of telmisartan, as shown by attenuation of vascular nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) activation and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. Coadministration of GW9662 with telmisartan abolished the above mentioned greater protective effects of telmisartan against vascular injury than losartan in db/db mice. Thus, PPAR\u03b3 activity appears to be involved in the vascular protective effects of telmisartan in db/db mice. Moreover, telmisartan, but not losartan, prevented the downregulation of vascular PPAR\u03b3 in db/db mice and this effect of telmisartan was cancelled by the coadministration of GW9662. Our data provided the first evidence indicating that PPAR\u03b3 activity of telmisartan contributed to the protective effects of telmisartan against diabetic vascular complication. PPAR\u03b3 activity of telmisartan was involved in the normalization of vascular PPAR\u03b3 downregulation in diabetic mice.

The data obtained suggest that the proposed complex therapy provides the most complete blood pressure reduction and aldosterone level correction (as evidence of RAAS activity recovery), greatly improves the prognoses, and ensures maximum nephroprotection in the patients with arterial hypertension and chronic kidney diseases.",

In all, 32 patients were treated with spironolactone and 4 with eplerenone for a median follow-up of 312 days. MRAs induced a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure from 162\u00b122 to 138\u00b114\u2009mm\u2009Hg (P<0.0001) and in diastolic blood pressure from 87\u00b117 to 74\u00b112\u2009mm\u2009Hg (P<0.0001).

It was found that besides classic RAAS acting via activation of angiotensin II (Ang-II) and its receptors, there is an alternative RAAS opposed to atherogenic potential of Ang-II. Renin and prorenin are shown to have both enzymatic and hormonal activities. Wider understanding appeared of extrarenal effects of aldosteron, its non-genomic activity.

Dyspnoea, pulmonary, and systemic congestion often characterize AHFS due to acutely elevated intracardiac filling pressures and fluid overload.

Despite available therapies, post-discharge mortality and re-hospitalization rates remain unacceptably high in AHFS. Neurohumoral-mediated cardiorenal dysfunction and congestion may contribute to these high event rates. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) serve a dual therapeutic role by enhancing diuresis and attenuating the pathological effects of RAAS and SNS activation. Although these agents are indicated in patients with chronic, severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF/REF) and in patients with HF/REF post-myocardial infarction (MI), they have not been systematically studied in patients with AHFS.

    "378": "The incidence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide, and there is a great need to identify therapies capable of arresting or reducing disease progression. The current treatment of chronic nephropathies is limited to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, but increasing clinical and experimental evidence suggests that statins could play a therapeutic role. Ultrastructural studies have shown the presence of gap junctions within all the cells of the glomerulus and podocytes have been found to contain primarily connexin-43. The present study aims to observe the beneficial effects of rosuvastatin on structural and ultrastructural renal morphology and on glomerular connexin-43 expression in normotensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rats were randomly allocated into four groups: WKY-C: normotensive animals no receiving rosuvastatin; WKY-ROS: normotensive animals receiving rosuvastatin; SHR-C: hypertensive animals no receiving rosuvastatin; SHR-ROS: hypertensive animals receiving rosuvastatin. Our results show no differences in blood urea, creatinine, uric acid and creatine phosphokinase levels between the groups, however, there was an decreasing of 24-h protein excretion in SHR-ROS. Capsular area in SHR-ROS was decreased, however, there was no alteration in urinary space. By transmission electron microscopy the slit diaphragm and podocyte foot processes were more preserved in SHR-ROS. By scanning electron microscopy the podocyte foot processes were more preserved in SHR-ROS. Increased connexin-43 immunofluorescence was observed in glomeruli of WKY-ROS and SHR-ROS. In conclusion, we hypothesize that renal pleiotropic effect of rosuvastatin can be a therapeutic tool for improving kidney ultrastructure and, consequently, renal function in hypertensive individuals.",

The retroperitoneal ureter was ligated with a 4.0 silk for the experimental model of ureteral obstruction in Wistar albino rats. Untreated group (n = 20) received no treatment. For the lisinopril-treated group (n = 20), 20 mg/kg/day of drug was given orally. Ultrastructural differences were analyzed using electron microscopic technique; apoptotic distribution was analyzed using the TUNEL method. After electron microscopic evaluation, on the 4th and 14th day in the untreated group, edema in the glomeruli, loss of microvillus and apoptotic cells in proximal tubule cells and sclerosis in the glomeruli were detected. On the 4th day in the lisinopril-treated group, the kidney was ultrastructurally normal and a less number of apoptotic cells were only observed on the 14th day. On light microscopic examination on the 4th and 14th day in the untreated group, while the glomeruli were normal in structure, the boundary of the proximal tubule was disrupted and some picnotic cells in both the proximal and collecting tubules were observed. In both 4th and 14th day of the lisinopril-treated group, kidney showed normal structure, although in some places picnotic cells in the collecting tubules were observed. In conclusion, lisinopril was effective and it may prevent early renal damage in the direct obstruction model.", 
    "383": "Earlier work from this laboratory demonstrated that apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) requires autocrine generation of angiotensin (ANG) II. More recent studies showed that angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which degrades ANGII to form ANG1-7, is protective but severely downregulated in human and experimental lung fibrosis. Here it was theorized that ACE-2 and its product ANG1-7 might therefore regulate AEC apoptosis. To evaluate this hypothesis, the AEC cell line MLE-12 and primary cultures of rat AECs were exposed to the profibrotic apoptosis inducers ANGII or bleomycin (Bleo). Markers of apoptosis (caspase-9 or -3 activation and nuclear fragmentation), steady-state ANGII and ANG1-7, and JNK phosphorylation were measured thereafter. In the absence of Bleo, inhibition of ACE-2 by small interfering RNA or by a competitive inhibitor (DX600 peptide) caused a reciprocal increase in autocrine ANGII and corresponding decrease in ANG1-7 in cell culture media (both P < 0.05) and, moreover, induced AEC apoptosis. At baseline (without inhibitor), ANG1-7 in culture media was 10-fold higher than ANGII (P < 0.01). Addition of purified ANGII or bleomycin-induced caspase activation, nuclear fragmentation, and JNK phosphorylation in cultured AECs. However, preincubation with ANG1-7 (0.1 \u03bcM) prevented JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment with A779, a specific blocker of the ANG1-7 receptor mas, prevented ANG1-7 blockade of JNK phosphorylation, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation. These data demonstrate that ACE-2 regulates AEC survival by balancing the proapoptotic ANGII and its antiapoptotic degradation product ANG1-7. They also suggest that ANG1-7 inhibits AEC apoptosis through the ANG1-7 receptor mas.",

The development of additional protective therapeutic interventions is, therefore, a major priority. Nuclear hormone receptors regulate carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, the immune response, inflammation and development of fibrosis. The increasing prevalence of DN has led to intense investigation of the role that nuclear hormone receptors may have in slowing or preventing the progression of renal disease. Several nuclear receptor-activating ligands (agonists) have been shown to have a renal protective effect in the context of DN. This review will discuss the evidence regarding the beneficial effects of the activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in preventing the progression of DN, and will describe how the discovery and development of compounds that modulate the activity of VDR and FXR may provide potential additional therapeutic approaches in the management of DN.",

With growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes, the burden of diabetic nephropathy (DN) will continue to grow. Based on a large body of epidemiological, experimental and interventional studies, strict glycemic control, blood pressure lowering and RAAS blockade are now the recommended strategies in the prevention and control of DN. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) have been shown unequivocally to reduce proteinuria and preserve renal function in affected patients. Importantly, therapeutic responses are dose dependent, and these drugs should be given in maximal dosages as tolerated. Combined use of ACEI and ARB reduced proteinuria and rate of decline of renal function, although it did not appear to confer extra renoprotection over the use of either agent alone. Spironolactone and aliskiren are alternative drugs that block the RAAS and have been demonstrated to further reduce proteinuria when added to ACEI or ARB. In the absence of long-term data about their safety and efficacy on renal function, combined use of these agents must be administered with caution after careful consideration of risk-benefit ratio with close monitoring for adverse effects, notably hyperkalemia. Pending further evidence, the use of a team approach to attain multiple treatment goals will improve renal outcomes in these high risk subjects.",

    "410": "High-frequency stimulation leads to a transient increase in the amplitude of evoked synaptic transmission that is known as posttetanic potentiation (PTP). Here we examine the roles of the calcium-dependent protein kinase C isoforms PKC\u03b1 and PKC\u03b2 in PTP at the calyx of Held synapse. In PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 double knockouts, 80% of PTP is eliminated, whereas basal synaptic properties are unaffected. PKC\u03b1 and PKC\u03b2 produce PTP by increasing the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles evoked by high-frequency stimulation and by increasing the fraction of this pool released by the first stimulus. PKC\u03b1 and PKC\u03b2 do not facilitate presynaptic calcium currents. The small PTP remaining in double knockouts is mediated partly by an increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude and partly by a mechanism involving myosin light chain kinase. These experiments establish that PKC\u03b1 and PKC\u03b2 are crucial for PTP and suggest that long-lasting presynaptic calcium increases produced by tetanic stimulation may activate these isoforms to produce PTP.",

The MABP was significantly raised (P<0.01) in diabetic WKY rats compared to the respective controls. The LVWT was also significantly (P<0.01) increased in diabetic WKY rats than that of control WKY rats. The mean total urinary kallikrein level and the mean total plasma kininogen level were higher (P<0.01) in diabetic WKY rats, when these rats were treated with captopril (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) against the mean value obtained from control WKY rats. In conclusion, this investigation suggests that diabetes induced in these rats can cause hypertension, increased LVWT and changes in the BK-forming components. Captopril treatment caused reduction in MABP, regression of LVWT and alterations in bradykinin (BK)-forming components. The possible significance of these observations is discussed.", 
    "412": "Doxorubicin is an effective anti-tumor agent with a cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. In addition to its principal toxic mechanisms involving iron and redox reactions, recent studies have described new mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cell death, including abnormal protein processing, hyper-activated innate immune responses, inhibition of neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/ErbB(HER) signalling, impaired progenitor cell renewal/cardiac repair, and decreased vasculogenesis. Although multiple mechanisms involved in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity have been studied, there is presently no clinically proven treatment established for doxorubicin cardiomyopathy. Iron chelator dexrazoxane, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and \u03b2-blockade have been proposed as potential preventive strategies for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Novel approaches such as anti-miR-146 or recombinant NRG1 to increase cardiomyocyte resistance to toxicity may be of interest in the future.", 
    "413": "Kinins are metabolized by metallopeptidases present in different tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate, employing functional studies in isolated human umbilical vein, the possible participation of angiotensin-converting enzyme, neutral endopeptidase and aminopeptidase P as an inactivation pathway of bradykinin, as well as assess if the endothelial layer is involved in this process. Concentration-response curves to bradykinin were constructed after 120 min incubation period on human umbilical vein rings with and without endothelium and enzymatic inhibitors were applied 30 min before construction of concentration-response curves. The presence of endothelium was confirmed by histological studies. Bradykinin-induced contractile responses were potentiated in human umbilical vein without endothelium when compared to intact tissues. Application of captopril 1 \u03bcM (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or phosphoramidon 10 \u03bcM (neutral endopeptidase inhibitor) induced a leftward shift of bradykinin-elicited responses in human umbilical vein with endothelium while no effect was observed in tissues denuded of endothelium under the same treatment. Exposure to apstatin 10 \u03bcM (aminopeptidase P inhibitor) did not potentiate bradykinin-induced effects in intact human umbilical vein. When angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase were concomitantly inhibited, there was a higher potentiation of bradykinin-elicited responses compared to the effects observed under individual inhibition of either enzyme. Moreover, concentration-response curves to FR190997, a non-peptidic bradykinin B(2) receptor agonist, were not modified under dual enzymatic inhibition. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time the functional relevance of angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, localized on the endothelial layer, acting concurrently as a bradykinin inactivating pathway in isolated human umbilical vein.",

Also, in the large outcome trials placebo treatment (whether or not in addition to other medication) was taken as the comparator, and it is uncertain whether the combination of perindopril and indapamide performs better than established modes of treatment. More studies are needed to establish whether the combination drug has similar positive effects in the long run in 'ordinary' patients and those with comorbid conditions or those who are treated with other drugs as well. Nevertheless, it is fair to state that the low-dose perindopril/indapamide combination adds to our pharmaceutical arsenal and can be applied as first-line treatment by physicians who care for patients with elevated blood pressure or, more broadly, those with cardiovascular disease.",

This study was a randomized, single-blind, two-period, two-sequence cross-over study which included 20 healthy adult male and female subjects under fasting conditions. In this study, one subject withdrew from the study and one reserve subject did not appear at both periods. The pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed based on the concentrations of perindopril (CAS 82834-16-0) and perindoprilat (CAS 95153-31-4) because perindopril has litte pharmacologic activity until hydrolized in the liver into its active metabolite, perindoprilat. The blood samples from 18 subjects were analyzed for plasma concentrations of perindopril and perindoprilat. In each of the two study periods (separated by a washout of three weeks) a single dose of test or reference drug was administered. Plasma concentrations of the drug were determined by LC-MS/MS method. The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed in this study were area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 192 h (AUC), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf), the peak plasma concentration of the drug (Cmax time needed to achieve the peak plasma concentration (tmax), and the elimination half-life (t(1/2)). The geometric mean ratios (90% CI) of the test drug/reference drug for perindopril and perindoprilat were 106.59% (92.97-122.20%) and 100.56% (94.11-107.46%) for AUC,, 106.64% (93.39-121.77%) and 100.88% (95.30-106.80%) for AUCinfo, and 101.23% (87.39-117.27%) and 99.30% (90.42-109.05%) for Cmax, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals calculated for AUCt and Cmax of perindopril and perindoprilat were within the standard bioequivalence range (80-125% for AUC and Cmax).

    "418": "Albuminuria is an important risk marker for adverse cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes and mortality. The relationship between albuminuria and risk is continuous and linear, like that of blood pressure and cardiovascular risk. Evidence now supports increased risk even at levels traditionally considered within normal limits. In high-risk patients, routine annual screening can detect changes in urine albumin excretion and improve the timely identification of albuminuria, and therefore should be considered in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Preferred simple screening methods appropriate for use in the primary care setting include microalbumin-specific dipsticks and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio determination (from a spot urine sample). Cornerstones of albuminuria treatment include risk factor management, ongoing monitoring, and, in patients with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes, the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blocking agents. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated utility in this regard; data from studies of direct renin inhibition are promising. The combined use of an ACE inhibitor and ARB was once considered a viable option for the treatment of albuminuria; however, results of the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) raised important questions regarding the benefits and limitations of dual RAAS blockade. Ongoing studies should provide important insight into the effects of this approach on renal outcomes.",

Together they form a heterogeneous group of acute hypertensive disorders depending on the presence or type of target organs involved. Despite better treatment options for hypertension, hypertensive crisis and its associated complications remain relatively common. In the Netherlands the number of patients starting renal replacement therapy because of 'malignant hypertension' has increased in the past two decades. In 2003, the first Dutch guideline on hypertensive crisis was released to allow a standardised evidence-based approach for patients presenting with a hypertensive crisis. In this paper we give an overview of the current management of hypertensive crisis and discuss several important changes incorporated in the 2010 revision. These changes include a modification in terminology replacing 'malignant hypertension' with 'hypertensive crisis with retinopathy and reclassification of hypertensive crisis with retinopathy under hypertensive emergencies instead of urgencies. With regard to the treatment of hypertensive emergencies, nicardipine instead of nitroprusside or labetalol is favoured for the management of perioperative hypertension, whereas labetalol has become the drug of choice for the treatment of hypertension associated with pre-eclampsia. For the treatment of hypertensive urgencies, oral administration of nifedipine retard instead of captopril is recommended as first-line therapy. In addition, a section on the management of hypertensive emergencies according to the type of target organ involved has been added. Efforts to increase the awareness and treatment of hypertension in the population at large may lower the incidence of hypertensive crisis and its complications.",

Respiratory function was measured in nonanesthetized mice by plethysmography. The 9-month-old mdx mice had elevated Penh values and decreased breathing frequency, due primarily to decreased inspiratory flow rate. All treatments normalized Penh values and increased peak inspiratory flow, leading to decreased inspiration times and breathing frequency. Additionally, forelimb grip strength was improved after 1D11 treatment at both 2 and 9 months of age, whereas, losartan improved grip strength only at 2 months. Decreased serum creatine kinase levels (significant improvement for all groups), increased diaphragm muscle fiber density, and decreased hydroxyproline levels (significant improvement for 1D11 only) also suggested improved muscle function after treatment. For all endpoints, 1D11 was equivalent or superior to losartan; coadministration of the two agents was not superior to 1D11 alone.

Male db/db mice were given 4 weekly subcutaneous injections of AOM (15 mg/kg body weight), and then, they received drinking water containing captopril (ACE inhibitor, 5mg/kg/day) or telmisartan (ARB, 5mg/kg/day) for 7 weeks. At sacrifice, administration of either captopril or telmisartan significantly reduced the total number of colonic premalignant lesions, i.e., aberrant crypt foci and \u03b2-catenin accumulated crypts, compared to that observed in the control group. The expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in the colonic mucosa of AOM-treated db/db mice were decreased by captopril and telmisartan. Captopril lowered the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and PAI-1 mRNAs, while telmisartan lowered the expression levels of COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and PAI-1 mRNAs in the white adipose tissues of these mice. In addition, these agents significantly reduced the levels of urinary 8-OHdG, a surrogate marker of oxidative damage to DNA, in the experimental mice. These findings suggested that both ACE inhibitor and ARB suppress chemically-induced colon carcinogenesis by attenuating chronic inflammation and reducing oxidative stress in obese mice. Therefore, targeting dysregulation of the RAS might be an effective strategy for chemoprevention of colorectal carcinogenesis in obese individuals.", 
    "461": "Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with resistance to carbapenem conferred by New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) are a type of newly discovered antibioticresistant bacteria. The rapid pandemic spread of NDM-1 bacteria worldwide (spreading to India, Pakistan, Europe, America, and Chinese Taiwan) in less than 2 months characterizes these microbes as a potentially major global health problem. The drug resistance of NDM-1 bacteria is largely due to plasmids containing the blaNDM-1 gene shuttling through bacterial populations. The NDM-1 enzyme encoded by the blaNDM-1 gene hydrolyzes \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, allowing the bacteria to escape the action of antibiotics. Although the biological functions and structural features of NDM-1 have been proposed according to results from functional and structural investigation of its homologues, the precise molecular characteristics and mechanism of action of NDM-1 have not been clarified. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of NDM-1 with two catalytic zinc ions in its active site. Biological and mass spectroscopy results revealed that D-captopril can effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity of NDM-1 by binding to its active site with high binding affinity. The unique features concerning the primary sequence and structural conformation of the active site distinguish NDM-1 from other reported metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs) and implicate its role in wide spectrum drug resistance. We also discuss the molecular mechanism of NDM-1 action and its essential role in the pandemic of drug-resistant NDM-1 bacteria. Our results will provide helpful information for future drug discovery targeting drug resistance caused by NDM-1 and related metallo-\u03b2-lactamases.",

The study of mimetics of diet and exercise and the combination thereof may provide additional treatments for a vulnerable elderly population; however, how and when to initiate such interventions requires consideration in developing the most safe and efficacious treatment strategies. In this review, we focus on preclinical late-life intervention studies, which assess the relationship between physical function, sarcopenia, and body composition. We provide a conceptual framework for the ever-changing definition of sarcopenia and a rationale for the use of an appropriate rodent model of this condition. We finish by providing our perspective regarding the implications of this body of work and future areas of research that may also contribute to the ultimate goal of extending healthspan.",

    "465": "In a retrospective cohort database study, we identified patients who received ARBs added to ongoing ACE-I therapy and who had at least 1 measurement of serum creatinine and potassium during each treatment period. We compared rates of hyperkalemia (>5.5 mmol/L) during equal periods of monotherapy and dual therapy and the rate of a significant rise in serum creatinine (\u22650.5 mg/dL) between study periods. We assessed the impact of potential confounders on outcomes by logistic regression analysis.", 
    "466": "Among 425 patients (median follow-up 19 months for each treatment period), hyperkalemia was 2-fold more common during dual therapy than monotherapy (11.1% and 5.6% of patients, respectively) (relative risk = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.22-3.14; P < 0.001). In 77 patients with reduced renal function on monotherapy (serum creatinine \u22651.5 mg/dL), the rate of hyperkalemia was 20.8/100 patient-years, resulting in a number needed to harm of 10.1 patients, compared with 52.6 patients among those with preserved renal function. Mean serum creatinine between treatment periods increased >0.5 mg/dL in 7.5% of patients, more commonly in patients with decreased (18.2%) than with preserved (5.2%) baseline renal function (P < 0.001).",

At the age of 32 weeks, DH rats were treated for 2 weeks with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (Capto, 30 mg/kg), PKC inhibitor ruboxistaurin (RBX, 50 mg/kg) or vehicle (n = 8 per group) and blood pressure was monitored using telemetry. At the end of experiments, femoral arteries were dissected, and vascular reactivity was evaluated with isovolumic myography.", 
    "470": "The IUPD followed by high salt diet resulted in significant elevation of plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and blood pressure. Endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in response to acetylcholine was blunted while vascular contraction in response to phenylephrine was enhanced in the DH rats. Neither Capto nor RBX restored endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation while both suppressed vascular contraction. Ex-vivo incubation of femoral arteries from control rats with insulin induced dose-response vasorelaxation while insulin failed to induce vasorelaxation in the DH rat arteries. In the control arteries treated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME, insulin induced vasoconstriction that was exacerbated in DH rats. Capto and RBX partially inhibited insulin-stimulated vascular contraction.",

    "472": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown cardioprotective and renoprotective properties. These agents are recommended as first-line therapy for the treatment of hypertension and the reduction of cardiovascular risk. Early studies pointed to the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of ARBs in high-risk patients. The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) established the clinical equivalence of the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of telmisartan and ramipril, but did not find an added benefit of the combination over ramipril alone. Similar findings were observed in the Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in aCE INtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) trial conducted in ACEI-intolerant patients. In ONTARGET, telmisartan had a better tolerability profile with similar renoprotective properties compared with ramipril, suggesting a potential clinical benefit over ramipril. The recently completed Olmesartan Reducing Incidence of Endstage Renal Disease in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (ORIENT) and Olmesartan and Calcium Antagonists Randomized (OSCAR) studies will further define the role of ARBs in cardioprotection and renoprotection for high-risk patients.", 
    "473": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers are considered the standard of care for treatment of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Combination therapy with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers effectively inhibits the renin-angiotensin system as well as potentiates the vasodilatory effects of bradykinin. It has been advocated that this dual blockade approach theoretically should result in improved clinical outcomes in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Clinical trial evidence for the use of combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in cardiovascular disease has provided conflicting results in hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Clinical trial evidence to support combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in chronic kidney disease has largely been based on proteinuria reduction as a surrogate marker for clinically meaningful outcomes. Recent large-scale randomized clinical trials have not been able to validate protection in halting progression in chronic kidney disease with a dual blockade approach. This review serves as an appraisal on the clinical evidence of combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockade in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.", 
    "474": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in humans. It affects 5% of the population older than age 65 years and is projected to rise as the population ages. Experimental data from animal models of AF show that AF is associated with progressive structural and electrical remodeling of the atria. Atrial fibrosis alters atrial electrical conduction and excitability and provides a substrate for AF maintenance. However, whether fibrosis is causally related to AF or an epiphenomenon and the precise mechanisms underlying atrial fibrosis remain unclear. A variety of signaling systems involving angiotensin II and related mediators are centrally involved in atrial fibrosis. This article reviews the role that atrial fibrosis plays in AF, the mechanisms of atrial fibrosis, and emerging therapeutic approaches to AF aimed at attenuating atrial fibrosis.", 
    "475": "The role of ANG II in skeletal muscle and satellite cell regulation is largely unknown. Cardiotoxin (CTX) was used to investigate whether muscle injury activates a local ANG II signaling system. Following injury, immunohistochelmistry (IHC) analysis revealed a robust increase in the intensity of angiotensinogen and angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor expression. As regeneration proceeded, however, AT(1) and angiotensinogen were downregulated. Nuclear accretion and fiber formation were also assessed during muscle regeneration in mice treated with captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). When ANG II formation was blocked through the use of captopril, we observed a significantly reduced accretion of nuclei into myofibers (-25%), while tibialis anterior total fiber number was significantly increased +37%. This phenotype appeared to be due to alterations in satellite cell differentiation kinetics; captopril treatment led to sustained mRNA expression of markers associated with quiescence and proliferation (Myf5, Pax7) and simultaneously delayed or inhibited the expression of myogenin. IHC staining supported these findings, revealing that captopril treatment resulted in a strong trend (P = 0.06) for a decrease in the proportion of myogenin-positive myoblasts. Furthermore, these observations were associated with a delay in muscle fiber maturation; captopril treatment resulted in sustained expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that localized skeletal muscle angiotensin signaling is important to muscle fiber formation, myonuclear accretion, and satellite cell function.", 
    "476": "Neuregulin1 proteins (NRG1s) are epidermal growth factor (EGF) family members which are ligands for the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). A decade of research has revealed that the NRG1-ErbB signaling is essential for the cardiac development and pivotal for maintaining the physiological function of the adult heart. The first evidence regarding the protective effect of the ErbB2 signaling in the adult heart came from clinical trials in breast cancer patients using Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the ErbB2 receptor. The incidence of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure increased five-fold in patients treated concurrently with chemotherapy drug doxorubicin and Trastuzumab compared to those treated with doxorubicin alone. Subsequent studies further show that stimulation of the ErbB2 signaling by NRG1s improves cardiomyocyte survival, growth and proliferation, maintains cardiac myofibril structure, counterbalances excessive \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and promotes angiogenesis in the heart. Injections of recombinant NRG1s improve cardiac function in animal models with myocardial infarction, doxorubicin, viral infection or pacing-induced heart failure. Recent clinical trials show that NRG1s are effective for improving the cardiac function in heart failure patients. These results suggest that NRG1s may become a new drug for the treatment of heart failure. NRG1s stimulate RTKs. This is different from Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) and Angiotensin II receptor blockers which inhibit the excessive activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). A clear understanding of how NRG1-ErbB signaling regulates cardiac function is essential for successful use of NRG1s for heart failure. Here, we review the current knowledge of the NRG1-ErbB signaling in the heart and discuss the potential use of NRG1s as novel therapy for heart failure.",

    "480": "In Japan, the number of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is thought to be 13,300,000, next in size after those with hypertension and diabetes. Although the number of patients with CKD seems large, it does not mean that all these patients require special treatment. Among them, nephrologists should pay special attention to patients with glomerular filtration rate below 50\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m(2) and progressive deterioration of renal function. Treatment of these CKD patients by a limited number of specialists is simply impossible; hence, it is essential to request treatment from physicians who are involved in general internal medicine and primary care. It is well known that not only does CKD cause end-stage renal failure, it also causes the onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as cardiac infarction and cerebral stroke; however, the question is how much significance does CKD have as a risk factor for CVD. It is understandable that hypertension and CVD are often complications of CKD; however, in addition to what is conventionally mentioned, there are three or four mechanisms that we would like to emphasize, and discuss herein. Among them, we would like to stress the role of klotho genes with special reference to the generation of CVD in CKD patients. When patients develop CKD, it is therefore necessary to remove as far as possible any factors that could represent a risk for CVD. Moreover, by taking appropriate measures against clinical conditions that often complicate CKD, such as hypertension, renal anemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidaemia, the development of CVD can be prevented.", 
    "481": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) regulates the blood pressure by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II and bradykinin to bradykinin 1-7. These two reactions elevate the blood pressure as angiotensin II and bradykinin are vasoconstrictory and vasodilatory hormones, respectively. Therefore, inhibition of ACE is an important strategy for the treatment of hypertension. The natural substrates of ACE, i.e., angiotensin II and bradykinin, contain a Pro-Phe motif near the site of hydrolysis. Therefore, there may be a Pro-Phe binding pocket at the active site of ACE, which may facilitate the substrate binding. In view of this, we have synthesized a series of thiol- and selenol-containing dipeptides and captopril analogues and studied their ACE inhibition activities. This study reveals that both the selenol or thiol moiety and proline residues are essential for ACE inhibition. Although the introduction of a Phe residue to captopril and its selenium analogue considerably reduces the inhibitory effect, there appears to be a Phe binding pocket at the active site of ACE.",

We aimed to determine the extent of renin-angiotensin inhibitor dose-dependent effects from randomized trials carried out in a clinical setting.", 
    "488": "In a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, alternate doses of angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with Type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria were compared. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 2006 to August 2010. Trials prior to January 2006 were identified from a prior systematic review. Identified outcomes were albumin excretion rate, progression and regression of albuminuria and adverse events.", 
    "489": "Four trials including 1051 patients compared doses of angiotensin receptor blockers. No trials compared doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The percentage decline in albumin excretion rate from baseline was greater with higher doses (18% higher, 95% CI 8-28%), the regression to normoalbuminuria was greater (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22-2.27), with less progression to macroalbuminuria (OR 0.62, CI 0.38-1.02).

It was showed nifedipine and captopril were most effective among the others in case of moderate hypertension without sympathetic hyperfunction. In patients with severe and moderate hypertension follow up with the hyperfunction of the sympathetic nervous system clonidine and mocsonidine showed the major efficacy.

Contemporary HF regimens often do not take into consideration many of the factors that might influence an individual's response to treatment. Clinical recommendations based on trial data derived from mainly younger Caucasian male study populations have, in most cases, been applied equally to women and African-Americans. Subgroup analyses of randomized HF trials and results of retrospective cohort studies have been used for customizing HF regimens in women and African-Americans. Pharmacogenetics is an emerging strategy for personalizing HF therapy. Genetic biomarkers may play an important role in predicting a patient's response to treatment and in predicting those at risk of toxicity. HF pharmacotherapy has improved over the last two decades; however, substantial work remains in order to personalize HF management and maximize the benefit of pharmacologic interventions, while limiting adverse events.", 
    "493": "The majority of patients with hypertension, and in particular high-risk patients or those with diabetes mellitus or renal dysfunction, are likely to require combination therapy with at least two antihypertensive agents (from different classes) to achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. The delapril/manidipine fixed-dose combination consists of two antihypertensive agents with different, yet complementary, mechanisms of action. Delapril/manidipine has demonstrated short- and long-term antihypertensive efficacy in a number of clinical studies in patients with hypertension with an inadequate response to monotherapy. Comparative studies have demonstrated that delapril/manidipine is as effective as enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with hypertension with an inadequate response to monotherapy, and as effective as irbesartan/HCTZ, losartan/HCTZ, olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ, ramipril/HCTZ and valsartan/HCTZ in reducing BP in patients with hypertension and diabetes, or in obese patients with hypertension. Therapy with delapril/manidipine also appears to exert beneficial effects that extend beyond a reduction in BP, including nephroprotective activity and an improvement in fibrinolytic balance, supporting its value as a treatment option in these patient populations at high or very high cardiovascular risk because of the presence of organ damage, diabetes or renal disease.",

In addition, it appears that acute treatment of hypertension in the setting of intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage is beneficial, but it is still uncertain in the setting of ischemic stroke what level of blood pressure will result in the best possible outcome.",

This unmet need appears to be related to factors like a residual high blood pressure and residual albuminuria. Strategies that enhance the efficacy of RAAS blockade, such as increasing the dose of ACEi or ARB, combining ACEi and ARB, or new RAAS inhibitor drugs like the direct renin inhibitors may help us in improving renal protection. However, it is likely that renal disease progression is caused by multiple risk factors and that we will need multiple approaches to tackle this residual risk. Recent trials testing the effect of vitamin D receptor activators and the effect of statins indicate that drugs in these classes may become valuable extra tools (in addition to ACEi or ARB) to tackle the unmet need in renal protection.",

Enalapril was given to 24 and telmisartan to 25 patients. Examination included 24-hour arterial pressure monitoring, echocardiography, duplex scanning of the left brachial artery. At the background of therapy with enalapril target levels of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (AP) were achieved in 79.2 and 70.85% of patients. This was associated with 54.2% reduction of number of non-dippers and night peakers.

New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III was assigned to the severity of the condition. Over 16 mo, this progressed to NYHA Class IV despite increasing medical therapy. Repeated evaluations suggested that implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy device with a defibrillator (CRT-D) could benefit this animal based on clinical signs and underlying evidence of dyssynchrony and suspected fibrotic myocardial disease. Surgical implantation of leads into the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle was accomplished. The CRT-D device was placed under the thoracic pectoral muscles during an initial surgical procedure. Improvement in the gorilla's clinical condition after implantation of the CRT-D device was immediate and dramatic. Subsequent scanning of the device was accomplished through operant conditioning. The data from these device interrogations included stored and real-time cardiac data, which were used to minimize recognized environmental stressors and change device settings. Over 4 yr, case management was critical to successful device use in treatment of the clinical disease. This involved medications, training for device interrogation, exercise to increase activity and improve body condition, and phlebotomy attempts. Dietary management was necessary to manipulate caloric and sodium intake and encourage medication compliance. Cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation, although requiring specialized equipment and surgical skill, appears to be a viable option for treatment of fibrosing cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction in gorillas refractory to medical management. In addition to treatment, this device provides cardiovascular data at rest that could allow for early diagnosis and treatment of gorillas with this and other cardiac conditions in the future. This describes the comprehensive medical, husbandry, and training techniques necessary to successfully manage this intense clinical case in conjunction with intracardiac device therapy.", 
    "506": "Alterations in the formation and metabolism of bradykinin (Bk) are hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, atherosclerosis and vascular complications of diabetes. However, despite its prominent role in cardiovascular regulation, studies on bradykinin have been limited by various difficulties in accurate measurements of this peptide in biological samples. In this study, using the LC-ESI-MS method we estimated the conversion of exogenous Bk to its main metabolites - Bk-(1-5) and Bk-(1-7) - in endothelial cell culture and in fragments of aorta of normotensive (WKY) and hypertensive rats (SHR). The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors were more pronounced in SHR: perindoprilat inhibited Bk-(1-5) formation by 49 % and 76 % in WKY and SHR rats, respectively, and tiorphan tended to decrease formation of Bk-(1-5) in both groups of animals.

Mast cell degranulation with compound 48/80 (CMP48/80, 1 \u03bcg/mL) also induced leucocyte adhesion but this was only weakly affected by the inhibitors. When Ang I and CMP48/80 were co-administered, AT(1B) receptor expression was increased, MCP-4 was found surrounding the vessel wall, and ACE was detected in the endothelium. Ang I + CMP48/80 induced enhanced leucocyte adhesion that was attenuated by losartan, enalapril, enalapril + chymostatin, and cromolyn (a mast cell stabilizer). The use of male mast cell-deficient WBB6F1/J-Kit(w)/Kit(w-v) mice (C57BL/6 background) confirmed these findings.",

With aging, progressive sympathetic activation, increased intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, endothelin system and oxidative stress and reduced nitric oxide (NO)-availability can damage podocytes. Apoptosis and proliferation are the principal podocyte changes following injury with the latter leading to sclerosis and loss of nephrons. Podocyte loss can be evaluated by either determining their average number in biopsed glomeruli or by estimating podocyte number or their associated molecules in urine sediment. Podocyturia may be considered a marker of active glomerular disease. Preliminary data suggest that antiadrenergic drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, RAS blocking drugs, endothelin system inhibitors and reduced oxidative stress can protect podocytes. Thus podocytes appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis, evaluation and therapy of age related glomerulosclerosis.",

The TA group showed lower activity of circulatory RAS components, such as decreased serum ACE activity and plasma renin activity compared to SA. However, depending on the age, although there were marked differences in the modulation of the RAS by training, both trained groups showed a reduction in circulating angiotensin II levels which may explain the lower blood pressure in both groups after swimming training.",

    "537": "In this study we aimed to investigate the vasorelaxant and antiatherogenic effects of the statins (fluvastatin and pravastatin) in the human saphenous vein grafts at the molecular level by using histopathologic, pharmacological and immunochemical techniques. The saphenous vein grafts evaluated histopathologically displayed a loss in their endothelium up to a ratio of 30% and set forth indications of functional deterioration. The pharmacological evaluations proved that the relaxation responses induced by fluvastatin and pravastatin were significantly inhibited by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine, and cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, while these responses were significantly increased by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, and rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632. The results of immunochemical studies are in accordance with the results of the pharmacological studies that the related statins increased the levels of nitric oxide, phospholipase A(2) and they decreased the levels of angiotensin II and active rho kinase. On the other hand mevalonolactone, a substrate of lipid metabolism, failed to change the effects of fluvastatin and pravastatin in the related tissue. The experimental results indicate that activation of nitric oxide synthase and phospholipase A(2)-cyclooxygenase pathway and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme and rho kinase may have a role on the effects of fluvastatin and pravastatin in the human saphenous vein grafts. It seems that the vasorelaxant and antiatherogenic effects of the related statins are independent of their lipid lowering mechanism.",

For the treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes, important agent-specific effects should be brought into consideration in the choice of drug. For these patients, and especially in the presence of kidney disease, the choice of agent must effectively target not only blood pressure reduction, but also prevention and treatment of MAU for optimal organ outcomes. A review of the current evidence suggests a diversity of MAU-associated risk reduction according to agent within the angiotensin receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor classes, ranging from nonefficacy to significant efficacy.

The inhibition of CES-mediated hydrolysis was achieved by pretreatment of the monolayers with bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (BNPP), which inhibited 94% of the total hydrolysis of temocapril in the Caco-2 cells. The remaining 6% hydrolysis was due to the presence of serine esterases, other than CES, on the cell membranes.

In Caco-2 cell monolayers with CES-mediated hydrolysis intact, temocaprilat derived from temocapril, was 2.5-fold more rapidly transported into the apical compartment than into the basolateral compartment due to the presence of microvilli on the apical membrane.

ACE2 is a multifunctional enzyme, and its actions on other vasoactive peptides, including the apelin-13 and apelin-17 peptides, also can contribute to its cardiovascular effects. The classical pathway of the renin-angiotensin system involving the ACE-Ang II-Ang II type-1 receptor axis is antagonized by the second arm constituted by the ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis. Loss of ACE2 enhances the adverse pathological remodeling susceptibility to pressure overload and myocardial infarction. Human recombinant ACE2 also is a negative regulator of Ang II-induced myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction and suppresses pressure overload-induced heart failure. Due to its characteristics, the ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas axis may represent new possibilities for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.

These patients had severe nephrosis that began postnatally at ages 15 days to 7 months and had preceding symptoms of viral infections. One infant had proven pertussis and required ventilation for respiratory failure. Renal biopsies showed varying degrees of mesangial expansion and increased cellularity. Two biopsies showed mild mesangial sclerosis and the other two only scattered globally sclerosed glomeruli.

The selection of antihypertensive drug therapy in persons with associated medical conditions depends on their medical conditions. Large meta-analyses of published trials show that thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and beta-blockers do not significantly differ in their ability to lower blood pressure and to exert cardiovascular protection in older and younger persons. If the blood pressure is more than 20/10 mm Hg above the goal blood pressure, drug therapy should be initiated with 2 antihypertensive drugs. Other coronary risk factors must be treated.",

ACE activity was assayed in vitro and ex vivo. Selected peptides were administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed with the MTT reduction test. The six heptapeptides at low micromolar concentration produced different degrees of in vitro inhibition of ACE activity using the synthetic substrate HHL or the natural substrate angiotensin I; and ex vivo inhibition of ACE-dependent, angiotensin I-induced vasoconstriction, but not angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. Oral administration of the hexapeptide PACEI32L, and the heptapeptides PACEI50L and PACEI52L, induced reductions in systolic blood pressure lasting up to 3h in SHRs but not in WKY rats. Intravenous injection of PACEI32L and PACEI50L, but not PACEI52L, induced acute transient reductions in mean blood pressure of SHRs. d-Amino acid peptides showed five-fold less ACE inhibitory potency, no inhibitory effect on angiotensin I-induced vasoconstriction, and antihypertensive effect in SHRs after i.v. injection, but not after oral administration. The toxicity of peptides to reduce the viability of cultured cells was in the millimolar range. In conclusion, we have obtained novel rationally designed heptapeptides with improved ACE inhibitory properties when compared to lead hexapeptides. One selected hexapeptide and two heptapeptides show oral antihypertensive effects in SHRs and appear safe in cytotoxicity assays.",

Enalapril treatment decreased blood pressure of SHR only and resulted in significantly more elastase-2 mRNA expression in carotid artery of both enalapril-treated WNR and SHR. Captopril induced a comparable rightward shift of concentration-response curves to ANG I in vehicle and enalapril-treated rats, although this effect was of lesser magnitude in SHR group. Chymostatin induced a rightward shift of the dose response to ANG I in vehicle-treated and a decrease in maximal effect of 22% in enalapril-treated WNR group. Maximal response induced by ANG I was remarkably reduced by chymostatin in enalapril-treated SHR carotid artery (by 80%) compared with controls (by 23%). Our data show that chronic ACE inhibition was associated with augmented functional role of non-ACE pathway in generating ANG II and increased elastase-2 gene expression, suggesting that this protease may contribute as an alternative pathway for ANG II generation when ACE is inhibited in the rat vascular tissue.",

Although mice homozygous for the A96S mutations had normal expression patterns of connexin40 in the kidney, they were hypertensive, had sixfold higher plasma renin concentrations, and had 40% higher levels of renin mRNA than controls. Renin-expressing cells were aberrantly located outside the media layer of afferent arterioles, and increased renal perfusion pressure did not inhibit renin secretion from kidneys isolated from homozygous A96S mice. Treatment with a low-salt diet in combination with an ACE inhibitor increased renin mRNA levels, plasma renin concentrations, and the number of aberrantly localized renin-producing cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the A96S mutation in connexin40 leads to renin-dependent hypertension in mice. Modulation of renin secretion by BP critically depends on functional connexin40; with the A96S mutation, the aberrant extravascular localization of renin-secreting cells in the kidney likely impairs the pressure-mediated inhibition of renin secretion.",

We performed an ex-vivo study with human aortic postsurgical specimens to test the hypothesis that Ang AT1 and AT2 receptor expression in human aortic arteries is associated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. We included 31 Mexican patients with coronary artery disease. We evaluated Angiotensin II receptor expression by immunostaining and angiotensin converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction. AT1 and AT2 receptor expression was increased in the aortic segments from the cardiovascular patients compared with control arteries and in patients with the DD genotype. There was a correlation between increased AT1 receptor expression and the number of cardiovascular risk factors present in the patient. Furthermore, reduction of AT1 expression correlated with the number of drug combinations used in the patients. These correlations were not present with respect to AT2 receptor expression.

We first compared the effect of perindopril, enalapril, and imidapril on cognitive impairment and brain injury in a mouse model of AD induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)\u2081\u208b\u2084\u2080. Perindopril, with significant inhibition of hippocampal ACE, significantly prevented cognitive impairment in this AD mouse model. This beneficial effect was attributed to the suppression of microglia/astrocyte activation and the attenuation of oxidative stress caused by iNOS induction and extracellular superoxide dismutase down-regulation. In contrast, neither enalapril nor imidapril prevented cognitive impairment and brain injury in this AD mouse. We next examined the protective effects of perindopril on cognitive impairment in PS2APP-transgenic mice overexpressing A\u03b2 in the brain. Perindopril, without affecting brain A\u03b2 deposition, significantly suppressed the increase in hippocampal ACE activity and improved cognition in PS2APP-transgenic mice, being associated with the suppression of hippocampal astrocyte activation and attenuation of superoxide. Our data demonstrated that the brain-penetrating ACE inhibitor perindopril, as compared to non-brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors, protected against cognitive impairment and brain injury in experimental AD models.",

A two-channel nanoLC system was used to continuously infuse substrate coupled with automated injections of substrate/small molecule mixtures, optionally containing the chromogenic Ellman reagent, through sol-gel derived acetylcholinesterase (AChE) doped monolithic columns. This is the first report of AChE encapsulated in monolithic silica for use as an immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER), and the first use of such IMERs for mixture screening. AChE IMER columns were optimized to allow rapid functional screening of compound mixtures based on changes in the product absorbance or the ratio of mass spectrometric peaks for product and substrate ions in the eluent. The assay had robust performance and produced a Z' factor of 0.77 in the presence of 2% (v/v) DMSO. A series of 52 mixtures consisting of 1040 compounds from the Canadian Compound Collection of bioactives was screened and two known inhibitors, physostigmine and 9-aminoacridine, were identified from active mixtures by manual deconvolution. The activity of the compounds was confirmed using the enzyme reactor format, which allowed determination of both IC(50) and K(I) values. Screening results were found to correlate well with a recently published fluorescence-based microarray screening assay for AChE inhibitors.",

Renal vascular resistances (RVR) markedly increased during MS (+23% in the T group, +21.6% in the V group, and +32.9% in the T+V group); GFR remained constant during the whole experiment. After treatment, ERPF decreased significantly during MS in the T group (-15%, P<0.05) and in the V group (-11.7%, p<0.01); in the T+V group, ERPF modifications were not statistically significant (P=0.07). In the T group, ERPF reverted to baseline values at the end of the stimulus, whereas in the V group, renal vasoconstriction was more prolonged. Only in hypertensive patients treated with 4 mg of T, RVR reverted to baseline during the recovery I, whereas in the V group, RVR remained elevated for the whole experiment. No modifications of GFR were observed in all groups. The kidney of hypertensive patients cannot react to a sympathetic stimulus with the physiological vasoconstriction.

Evidence suggests that the heart primarily remodels during sleep. Although a growing body of clinical and epidemiological evidence suggests that the timing of therapy, such as ACE inhibition, alters diurnal blood pressure patterns in patients with hypertension, the benefits of chronotherapy on myocardial and vascular remodeling have not been studied.", 
    "691": "We examined the effects of the short-acting ACE inhibitor, captopril, on the structure and function of cardiovascular tissue subjected to pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice. Captopril (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or placebo was administered at either murine sleep time or wake time for 8 weeks starting 1 week after surgery.", 
    "692": "TAC mice given captopril at sleep time had improved cardiac function and significantly decreased heart: body weight ratios, myocyte cross-sectional areas, intramyocardial vascular medial wall thickness, and perivascular collagen versus TAC mice given captopril or placebo during wake time. Captopril induced similar drops in blood pressure at sleep or wake time, suggesting that time-of-day differences were not attributable to blood pressure changes. These beneficial effects of captopril were correlated with diurnal changes in ACE mRNA expression in the heart.", 
    "693": "The ACE inhibitor captopril benefited cardiovascular remodeling only when administered during sleep; wake-time captopril ACE inhibition was identical to that of placebo. These studies support the hypothesis that the heart (and vessels) remodel during sleep time and also illustrate the importance of diurnal timing for some cardiovascular therapies.",

We prepared the pH-modulated SD (pSD) and compressed tablets consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 as a carrier, drug and MgO (alkalizer). Telmisartan (TEL), an ionizable poorly water-soluble drug, was chosen as a model drug. The changes in physicochemical factors such as the dissolution rate, drug crystallinity, microenvironmental pH (pH(M)) and intermolecular interactions of the pSD and the tablets were investigated over 3 months under different temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions: refrigerator (5-8 \u00b0C), 25 \u00b0C/32% RH, 25 \u00b0C/55% RH, 25 \u00b0C/75% RH, 40\u00b0C/32% RH, 40 \u00b0C/55% RH, and 40 \u00b0C/75% RH. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of all samples revealed no distinct changes in the drug melting point. In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) diffractograms revealed that samples stored at 40 \u00b0C/75% RH for 1 month, 25 \u00b0C/75% RH for 3 months and 40 \u00b0C at all humidity conditions for 3 months showed gradual recrystallization of the drug. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra indicated a reduced intensity of intermolecular interactions between TEL and MgO in the pSD and tablet. The pH(M) also gradually decreased. These altered physicochemical factors under the stressed conditions resulted in decreased dissolution profiles in intestinal fluid (pH 6.8). In contrast, the dissolution rate in gastric fluid (pH 1.2) was almost unchanged because of the high intrinsic solubility of TEL at this pH.", 
    "695": "The concept of \"pharmacogenomics\" or \"pharmacogenetics\" promises to offer the ultimate in personalized medicine, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the most plausible candidates for the application of this approach in the area of hypertension. For the past two decades, genetic variants of the RAS have been tested for association with blood pressure response, but the results have been inconsistent. The problems have been attributed to many issues, but the most fundamental concern is thought to be the statistical power of the studies. Therefore, we have tried to put together a new systematic review using a database search including only recent reports with adequate numbers of subjects, and 11 reports were identified. From the results, we were able to draw conclusions with nearly consistent findings that the conventional genetic variants of the system (i.e., the ACE I/D, AGT M235T, AT1 A1166C, and AT2 variant) are not associated with antihypertensive effects by RAS blockade, at least by one individual SNP. By contrast, significant associations have been reported (by one report each) for AGT rs7079, AT1 haplotype, REN, and ACE2. For these variants, further evaluations and confirmation are anticipated.", 
    "696": "Cardiotoxicity remains a major limitation of chemotherapy, strongly affecting the quality of life and the overall survival of cancer patients, regardless of their oncologic prognosis. The time elapsed from the end of cancer therapy to the beginning of heart failure therapy for chemotherapy-induced cardiac dysfunction is an important determinant of the extent of recovery. This highlights the need for a real-time diagnosis of cardiac injury. The current standard for monitoring cardiac function detects cardiotoxicity only when a functional impairment has already occurred, precluding any chance of preventing its development. In the last decade, early identification, assessment, and monitoring of cardiotoxicity, by measurement of serum cardiospecific biomarkers, have been proposed as an effective alternative. In particular, the role of troponin I in identifying patients at risk for cardiotoxicity and of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing left ventricular ejection fraction reduction and cardiac events has clearly proved to be an effective strategy for this complication. In addition, novel biomarkers for the identification of cardiotoxicity are emerging. The use of a multimarker approach may provide a unique opportunity for advancement in this field, allowing for better stratification of the cardiac risk in cancer patients treated with anticancer drugs.",

In the historic cohort, 83% were prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 8.5% were prescribed \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists, compared with 89% and 80%, respectively, in the contemporary cohort. Mortality rates over the first year of follow-up declined from 12.5% to 7.8% between eras (P=0.04), and sudden death contributed less to contemporary mortality (33.6% versus 12.7%; P<0.001). New York Heart Association class declined between eras (P<0.001). QTc dispersion across the chest leads declined from 85 ms (SD, 2) to 34 ms (SD, 1) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions declined from 65 mm (SD, 0.6) to 59 mm (SD, 0.5) (both P<0.001).",

A\u03b2 metabolism is a dynamic process in the A\u03b2 production and clearance that requires neprilysin (NEP) and other enzymes to degrade A\u03b2. It has been reported that NEP expression is significantly decreased in the brain of AD patients. Previously we have documented hypoxia is a risk factor for A\u03b2 generation in vivo and in vitro through increasing A\u03b2 generation by altering \u03b2-cleavage and \u03b3-cleavage of APP and down-regulating NEP, and causing tau hyperphosphorylation. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia-induced down-regulation of NEP. We found a significant decrease in NEP expression at the mRNA and protein levels after hypoxic treatment in mouse primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and relative quantitative PCR (q-PCR) revealed an increase of histone H3-lysine9 demethylation (H3K9me2) and a decrease of H3 acetylation (H3-Ace) in the NEP promoter regions following hypoxia. In addition, we found that hypoxia caused up-regulation of histone methyl transferase (HMT) G9a and histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC-1. Decreased expression of NEP during hypoxia can be prevented by application with the epigenetic regulators 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), HDACs inhibitor sodium valproate (VA), and siRNA-mediated knockdown of G9a or HDAC1. DNA methylation PCR data do not support that hypoxia affects the methylation of NEP promoters. This study suggests that hypoxia may down-regulate NEP by increasing H3K9me2 and decreasing H3-Ace modulation.",

Using multivariate survival analysis, achievement of remission was the factor most strongly associated with reduced risk of RRT or death. There was no significant difference in outcomes between patients who did or did not receive IS, although patients receiving IS had more severe disease. Contrary to published findings, 81.8% of patients treated with the Ponticelli regimen (6 months of alternating prednisolone and cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil) suffered significant treatment-related complications compared with 19% of patients prescribed the Cattran regimen (prolonged combined low-dose prednisolone and cyclosporine).",

We provide an overview of the definition and disease mechanisms of VCI and present a systematic literature review of the current evidence for the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies used to treat the VCI symptoms of cognitive dysfunction or to modify VCI through primary and secondary prevention. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched from 2005 to October 2010 using the keywords \"vascular dementia\" or \"vascular cognitive impairment and therapy.\" MEDLINE was searched for English-language articles published within the last 10\u00a0years using the combined Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) \"therapeutics and dementia,\" \"vascular\" or \"vascular cognitive impairment.\" Although cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine produce small cognitive improvements in patients with VCI, these drugs do not improve global clinical outcomes and have adverse effects and costs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may improve short-term cognitive function in patients with VCI. Anti-hypertensive therapy with an ACE inhibitor-based regimen and statins may prevent the major subtype of VCI known as poststroke cognitive decline. Clinical and effectiveness studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the benefits and risks of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies to prevent and treat VCI. Given its growing health, social, and economic burden, the prevention and treatment of VCI are critical priorities for clinical care and research.",

In the present study, five organic extracts of a marine brown seaweed Ecklonia cava were prepared by using ethanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform, hexane, and diethyl ether as solvents, which were then tested for their potential ACE inhibitory activities. Ethanol extract showed the strongest ACE inhibitory activity with an IC(50) value of 0.96 mg/ml. Five kinds of phlorotannins, phloroglucinol, triphlorethol-A, eckol, dieckol, and eckstolonol, were isolated from ethanol extract of E. cava, which exhibited potential ACE inhibition. Dieckol was the most potent ACE inhibitor and was found to be a non-competitive inhibitor against ACE according to Lineweaver-Burk plots. Dieckol had an inducible effect on the production of NO in EAhy926 cells without having cytotoxic effect.

Primary outcomes were rate of decline in measured glomerular filtration rate and a composite of a decrease in glomerular filtration rate by >50% or >25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), requirement for dialysis, transplantation, or death. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a BP effect on either the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate or the clinical composite outcome.

    "742": "In the CIBIS III trial, 1010 patients (mean age: 72.4 years; mean ejection fraction: 28.8%; male: 68.2%) with stable CHF were randomized to up-titration of monotherapy with either bisoprolol (target dose 10 mg o.d.) or enalapril (target dose 10 mg b.i.d.) for 6 months, followed by their combination for 6-24 months. Endpoints were mortality or all-cause hospitalization, mortality alone and mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization. The study drug (ACE-I or beta-blocker) was last prescribed at \u226550% of target dose to significantly more patients for the first initiated drug in both treatment groups (both P< 0.001). Sixty per cent of endpoints were reached during the monotherapy phase and randomized treatment during monotherapy was not a predictor of the three assessed outcomes. Monotherapy phase was the strongest independent predictor of outcome (P< 0.0001 for all endpoints). Older age, NYHA class III, impaired renal function, lower body weight and blood pressure at baseline, and hypotension, bradycardia and heart failure during treatment were associated with the inability to reach high dose of both study drugs.", 
    "743": "The order of drug administration plays an important role in whether CHF patients reach target doses of bisoprolol and enalapril. For both study drugs, the dose level reached was associated with baseline characteristics and adverse events. In CHF patients not treated with an ACE-I or a beta-blocker, the duration of monotherapy with either type of drug should be shorter than 6 months.", 
    "744": "Forensic analysis of pharmaceutical preparations requires a comparative analysis with a standard of the suspected drug in order to identify the active ingredient. Purchasing analytical standards can be expensive or unattainable from the drug manufacturers. Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART\u2122) is a novel, ambient ionization technique, typically coupled with a JEOL AccuTOF\u2122 (accurate mass) mass spectrometer. While a fast and easy technique to perform, a drawback of using DART\u2122 is the lack of component separation of mixtures prior to ionization. Various in-house pharmaceutical preparations were purified using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and mass spectra were subsequently obtained using the AccuTOF\u2122- DART\u2122 technique. Utilizing TLC prior to sample introduction provides a simple, low-cost solution to acquiring mass spectra of the purified preparation. Each spectrum was compared against an in-house molecular formula list to confirm the accurate mass elemental compositions. Spectra of purified ingredients of known pharmaceuticals were added to an in-house library for use as comparators for casework samples. Resolving isomers from one another can be accomplished using collision-induced dissociation after ionization. Challenges arose when the pharmaceutical preparation required an optimized TLC solvent to achieve proper separation and purity of the standard. Purified spectra were obtained for 91 preparations and included in an in-house drug standard library. Primary standards would only need to be purchased when pharmaceutical preparations not previously encountered are submitted for comparative analysis. TLC prior to DART\u2122 analysis demonstrates a time efficient and cost saving technique for the forensic drug analysis community. Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

All patients were on at least one antihypertensive medication, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (37%), beta-blockers (35%), angiotensin receptor blockers (32%), diuretics (29%) and calcium channel blockers (21%). Backward multiple regression analysis showed that age (P \u2264 0.001) and the use of calcium channel blockers (P = 0.037) were the only factors inversely associated with lower total sleep time. Sleep efficiency was inversely associated only with age (P \u2264 0.001), whereas the use of calcium channel blockers had a nonsignificant trend (P = 0.092). Use of calcium channel blockers was associated with significant reduction in total sleep time (-41 min, P = 0.005) and 8% lower sleep efficiency (P = 0.004). No other antihypertensive medication, including diuretics and beta-blockers, was associated with sleep impairment.",

    "750": "We have found that Streptococcus gordonii FSS2, an infective endocarditis (IE) isolate, expresses a dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase with activity homologous to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The carboxypeptidase activity was purified to homogeneity as a complex/aggregate from a bacterial surface extract and was also active as a 165 kDa monomer. The specific activity for the carboxypeptidase activity was eightfold higher than that for recombinant human ACE. Selected ACE inhibitors, captopril, lisinopril and enalapril, did not inhibit the ACE activity. The carboxypeptidase also hydrolysed the A\u03b1 and B\u03b2-chains of human fibrinogen, which resulted in impaired fibrin formation by thrombin. The gene encoding ACE carboxypeptidase activity was sequenced and the inferred polypeptide product showed 99\u200a% amino acid homology to SGO_0566, sgc, 'challisin' of S. gordonii CL1 Challis, and had no significant amino acid sequence homology to human ACE. Homologues of challisin ACE activity were commonly detected among the viridans group streptococci most often associated with IE.", 
    "751": "The prognostic role of specific biomarkers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic activation pathways in heart failure has never been investigated in populations with current evidence-weighted treatment. To establish whether the plasma renin activity (PRA), among several neurohormonal biomarkers, is able to predict cardiac events in a population of patients with heart failure on up-to-date treatment, we selected 996 consecutive patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <50%, mean age 65 \u00b1 13 years), who underwent a complete clinical and humoral characterization and were then followed up (median 36 months, range 0 to 72) for cardiac death and appropriate implantable cardioverter device shock. We recorded 170 cardiac deaths and 27 shocks. On Cox multivariate analysis, only ejection fraction (hazard ratio 0.962, 95% confidence interval 0.938 to 0.986), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; hazard ratio 1.729, 95% confidence interval 1.383 to 2.161) and PRA (hazard ratio 1.201, 95% confidence interval 1.024 to 1.408) were independent predictors of cardiac death. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a cutoff value for PRA of 2.30 ng/ml/hour that best predicted cardiac mortality. Independent predictors of PRA were ejection fraction, functional class, sodium, potassium, NT-proBNP, norepinephrine, aldosterone, C-reactive protein, and medical therapy. The association of high NT-proBNP and high PRA identified a subgroup (22% of the study population) with the greatest risk of cardiac death. In conclusion, PRA resulted an independent prognostic marker in patients with systolic heart failure additive to NT-proBNP level and ejection fraction. PRA might help to select those patients needing an enhanced therapeutic effort, possibly targeting incomplete renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade.",

We evaluated the role of wild-type (wt) and mutant UCP3 proteins in palmitate oxidation and in triglyceride storage in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). Palmitate oxidation was \u223c60% lower (P<0.05; P<0.01) and triglyceride storage was higher in HEK293 cells expressing the four UCP3 mutants than in cells expressing wt UCP3. Moreover, mutants V56M and Q252X exerted a dominant-negative effect on wt protein activity (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively).

    "777": "Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer observed in women and endogenous estrogens are thought to play a major role in its development. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator which is widely used to treat and prevent breast cancer. Tamoxifen is an ER antagonist in the breast but an ER agonist in cardiovascular system (CVS) and some other tissues. Many patients experience resistance to tamoxifen. Several studies have indicated various mechanisms in tamoxifen resistance. Growth factors and their receptors, extracellular proteins, transcription factors, cell-cycle regulators, and signal-transduction molecules have been identified as being potentially involved in tamoxifen resistance. The aim of the present hypothesis is to provide evidences that may lead to this suggestion that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may have a role in tamoxifen resistance. It has been established in numerous studies that RAS play a role in the progression of various cancers such as breast cancer. Besides, other studies have indicated that estrogen has an inhibitory effect on the RAS components levels in CVS and various tissues such as the adrenal and the pituitary. Therefore, it can be suggested that tamoxifen may increase RAS components levels in the breast tissue by its antagonistic effect on ER and causes resistance. Confirmation of this theory by experimental investigations may lead to this suggestion that combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-1 blockers with tamoxifen may have a preventive effect on development of acquired tamoxifen resistance.",

The renin angiotensin system (RAS) is considered to be involved in most of the pathological processes that result in diabetic nephropathy. This system has various subsystems which contribute to the disease pathology. One of these involves angiotensin II (Ang II) which shows increased activity during diabetic nephropathy. This causes hypertrophy of various renal cells and has a pressor effect on arteriolar smooth muscle resulting in increased vascular pressure. Ang II also induces inflammation, apoptosis, cell growth, migration and differentiation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production responsible for renal fibrosis is also regulated by RAS. Polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and Angiotensinogen has been shown to have effects on RAS. Available treatment modalities have proven effective in controlling the progression of nephropathy. Various drugs (based on antagonism of RAS) are currently in the market and others are still under trial.

The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of the soluble fraction of BW powders were also investigated. Furthermore, the products were characterized by analyzing their chemical composition. Chemical composition, solubility, OBC, and EC of the BW powders was significantly (P < 0.05) different with different DH, while color, ES, and WHC were not significantly (P > 0.05) different. Salt content of the FPH was high (4% to 19%) and increased with increased DH. Protein solubility varied from 10% to 70% and increased with increased DH. WHC of the FPH was around 97% and was higher than that of all the reference proteins tested. OBC decreased with increased DH (from 3.5 to 2.1 g oil/g protein) and was higher than OBC of the soy and milk proteins (1.6 to 1.9 g oil/g protein). EC of FPH was similar or lower than the reference proteins. ES of FPH (60% to 90%) was similar to or lower than soy and whey proteins (60% to 98%) but higher than casein (20%). ACE inhibition activity increased as DH was increased. Practical Application: The results from this study demonstrate that a functional bioactive hydrolysate can be produced from BW, which is an underutilized fish species, and may aid the industry in better utilizing this raw material. The novelty of this research was the use of BW as a raw material where the protein has been isolated with the pH shift method. Furthermore, it was novel that bioactivity and functionality was measured in the same samples.",

Therefore, we investigated the proteolytic activity of MMPs in fistula tissue and examined the effect of inhibitors, including clinically available drugs that beside their main action also suppress MMPs. Fistula specimens were obtained by surgical excision from 22 patients with Crohn's disease and from 10 patients with fistulas resulting from other causes. Colonic endoscopic biopsies from six controls were also included. Total functional MMP activity was measured by a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based, fluorogenic MMP-substrate cleavage assay, and the specific activity of MMP-2, -3 and -9 by the MMP Biotrak Activity Assay. The MMP inhibitors comprised ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), the synthetic broad-spectrum inhibitor, GM6001, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramiprilate, and the tetracycline, doxycycline. In Crohn's disease fistulas, about 50% of the total protease activity was attributable to MMP activity. The average total MMP activity was significantly higher (about 3.5-times) in Crohn's fistulas (471 FU/\u03bcg protein, range 49-2661) compared with non-Crohn's fistulas [134 FU/\u03bcg protein, range 0-495, (p < 0.05)] and normal colon [153 FU/\u03bcg protein, range 77-243, (p < 0.01)]. MMP-3 activity was increased in Crohn's fistulas (1.4 ng/ml, range 0-9.83) compared with non-Crohn's fistulas, [0.32 ng/ml, range 0-2.66, (p < 0.02)]. The same applied to MMP-9 activity [0.64 ng/ml, range 0-5.66 and 0.17 ng/ml, range 0-1.1, respectively (p < 0.04)]. Ramiprilate significantly decreased the average total MMP activity level by 42% and suppressed the specific MMP-3 activity by 72%, which is comparable to the effect of GM6001 (87%). Moreover, MMP-9 activity was completely blunted by ramiprilate. Doxycycline had no effect on MMP activity. Increased functional MMP activity, notably MMP-3 and -9, is present in Crohn's fistulas and may be inhibited by ramiprilate, a widely available ACE inhibitor.", 
    "797": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of visual impairment in working age in industrialized countries. It is classified as non-proliferative (mild, moderate or severe) and proliferative, with diabetic macular oedema potentially developing at any of these stages. The prevalence and incidence of DR increase with diabetes duration and worsening of metabolic and blood pressure control. Current approaches to prevent and/or treat DR include optimized control of blood glucose and blood pressure and screening for early identification of high-risk, although still asymptomatic, retinal lesions. Results from recent clinical trials suggest a role for blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) and for fenofibrate in reducing progression and/or inducing regression of mild-to-moderate non-proliferative DR. Intravitreal administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents was shown to reduce visual loss in more advanced stages of DR, especially in macular oedema.", 
    "798": "Randomized multicenter studies in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with chronic proteinuric nephropathies have clearly demonstrated that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) used alone or in combination, effectively retard renal disease progression. Proteinuria reduction, in addition to arterial blood pressure control, largely mediates the nephroprotective effect of RAS inhibitor therapy. Despite RAS inhibition, however, most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This highlights the importance of innovative therapies to halt or revert CKD progression in those at risk. Along this line, a multimodal strategy (Remission Clinic) targeting urinary proteins by dual RAS inhibition with ACE inhibitors and ARBs up-titrated to maximum tolerated doses, by intensified blood pressure control, amelioration of dyslipidemia by statins, smoking cessation and healthy lifestyle implementation was safely and effectively applied at our outpatient clinic to normalize urinary proteins and prevent renal function loss in patients otherwise predicted to rapidly progress to ESRD because of nephrotic-range proteinuria refractory to standard antihypertensive dosages of an ACE inhibitor. This approach achieved remission or regression of proteinuria and stabilized kidney function in most cases, and almost fully prevented progression to ESRD. Provided patients are closely monitored and treatment is cautiously up-titrated according to tolerability, this approach might be safely applied in day-by-day hospital practice. Effective prevention of ESRD would reduce costs of renal replacement therapy by dialysis or transplantation and would be life-saving where these are not available for all patients in need.", 
    "799": "Proteinuria is the main indicator of renal disease progression in many chronic conditions. There is currently little information available on the efficacy, safety, and individual tolerance of patients with post-diarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome (D+ HUS) nephropathy to therapies involving diet, enalapril, or losartan. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trail was conducted to evaluate the effect of a normosodic-normoproteic diet (Phase I) and the effect of normosodic-normoproteic diet plus enalapril (0.18-0.27 mg/kg/day) or losartan (0.89-1.34 mg/kg/day) (Phase II) on children with D+ HUS, normal renal function, and persistent, mild (5.1-49.9 mg/kg/day) proteinuria. Dietary intervention reduced the mean protein intake from 3.4 to 2.2 mg/kg/day. Of 137 children, proteinuria normalized in 91 (66.4 %) within 23-45 days; the remaining 46 patients were randomized to diet plus placebo (group 1, n\u2009=\u200916), plus losartan (group 2, n\u2009=\u200916), or enalapril (group 3, n\u2009=\u200914). In groups 1, 2, and 3, proteinuria was reduced by 30.0, 82.0, and 66.3%, respectively, and normalized in six (37.5%), three (81.3%), and 11 (78.6%) patients, respectively (\u03c7(2)= 8.9, p\u2009=\u20090.015). These results suggest that: (1) a normosodic-normoproteic diet can normalize proteinuria in the majority of children with D+ HUS with mild sequelae, (2) the addition of enalapril or losartan to such dietary restrictions of protein further reduces proteinuria, and (3) these therapeutic interventions are safe and well tolerated. Whether these short-term effects can be extended to the long-term remains to be demonstrated.",

We conducted a pharmacoepidemiologic study to examine the incidence of insomnia in hypertensive patients by using a post-marketing surveillance database. The insomnia onset was defined as the time of first prescription of hypnotics. The insomnia incidence rate in hypertensive patients under antihypertensive therapy was 0.77/100 person-years. The median insomnia onset date was 5 weeks. The insomnia type in 50.2% of the patients was difficulty in initiating sleep. We assessed the factors contributing to insomnia by using a nested case-control design. We selected 10 time-matched controls for every case. The hypotensive effect induced by antihypertensive therapy on the case group was lesser than that on the control group (p<0.01). The odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using multivariate conditional logistic regression. The factors contributing to insomnia onset were \u03b1 blockers (OR, 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-4.98), \u03b2 blockers (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.99-2.39), and calcium channel blockers (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.90) compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; female sex (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.44); complication of gastric/duodenal disorders (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.14-4.86) or musculoskeletal system/connective tissue disorders (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.23-4.79); and concomitant antihypertensive therapy (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31-0.63). This study identified the potential factors that may help to predict insomnia onset in hypertensive patients under antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "801": "Accumulating evidence indicates several drugs for lifestyle-related diseases are involved in bone metabolism. Drugs that might reduce fracture incidence are statins, \u03b2-blockers and thiazide diuretics, and those that might increase fractures are thiazolidinediones and loop diuretics.

    "802": "Ibudilast [1-(2-isopropylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-yl)-2-methylpropan-1-one] is a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor used clinically to treat asthma. Efforts to selectively develop the PDE3- and PDE4-inhibitory activity of ibudilast led to replacement of the isopropyl ketone by a pyridazinone heterocycle. Structure-activity relationship exploration in the resulting 6-(pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-yl)pyridazin-3(2H)-ones revealed that the pyridazinone lactam functionality is a critical determinant for PDE3-inhibitory activity, with the nitrogen preferably unsubstituted. PDE4 inhibition is strongly promoted by introduction of a hydrophobic substituent at the pyridazinone N(2) centre and a methoxy group at C-7' in the pyrazolopyridine. Migration of the pyridazinone ring connection from the pyrazolopyridine 3'-centre to C-4' strongly enhances PDE4 inhibition. These studies establish a basis for development of potent PDE4-selective and dual PDE3/4-selective inhibitors derived from ibudilast.", 
    "803": "Left ventricular (LV) remodeling represents an important determinant in the progression to heart failure in patients after myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in patients with first ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction who were successfully and completely reperfused whether the control of cholesterol is predictive of LV remodeling. A total of 109 patients referred to a coronary care unit for first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were analyzed. According to the change in indexed LV end-diastolic volume detected at follow-up visits, patients were divided into nonremodeling (n = 79) and remodeling (n = 30) groups. At coronary care unit admission, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors was similar in the 2 groups. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol values were used as criteria for cholesterol control. At follow-up visits, the prevalence of patients with target levels of plasma LDL cholesterol was lower in the remodeling compared to the nonremodeling group (67% and 91%, respectively, p <0.01). After adjusting for age, gender, baseline LV ejection fraction, baseline indexed LV end-diastolic volume, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking status, time from acute event, drugs (\u03b2 blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and statins), wall motion score index, and troponin levels, logistic regression analysis showed that patients with nontarget LDL cholesterol values at follow-up were significantly more likely to show cardiac remodeling (odds ratio 22.3, 95% confidence interval 2.91 to 171.9, p = 0.003). In conclusion, the present study shows that unsatisfactory control of LDL cholesterol independently predicts LV remodeling in patients with first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.", 
    "804": "Aldosterone, a steroid hormone with mineralocorticoid activity, is far more than merely a salt-and-water hormone. Aldosterone has a number of non-classical, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated actions, including tissue remodeling, modulation of vascular tone and stimulating inflammation and fibrosis, which may fuel progression of end organ damage. Aldosterone breakthrough during blockade of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) may explain why this treatment regimen only confers partial cardiovascular and renal protection. Of major interest, aldosterone is deleterious only if inappropriately high for its sodium status i.e. high aldosterone and high sodium. The mechanism of sodium dependence of aldosterone-induced renal and cardiovascular damage continues to fascinate. Aldosterone excess increases sodium and fluid retention and consequently increases blood pressure, which, in turn, mediates target organ damage. Moreover, blood pressure independent effects play a role with dissociation of low circulating and high tissue aldosterone levels during high sodium intake and possibly enhanced MR signaling. MR blockade is a valuable strategy, which has potency to halt the progressive end organ damage as observed during current treatments. In heart failure, MR blockade on top of RAAS blockade reduces hard clinical endpoints. Despite encouraging results on the intermediate endpoint proteinuria, long-term data on the efficacy and safety of MR blockade in preventing dialysis and/or cardiovascular endpoints in chronic kidney disease are still lacking. It is obligatory that future clinical studies on the effects of MR blockade on end-organ damage take into account the sodium status.",

In this post hoc analysis of the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial, we evaluated whether being overweight or obese influences the incidence rate of renal events and affects the response to ramipril. Of the 337 trial participants with known body mass index (BMI), 105 (31.1%) were overweight and 49 (14.5%) were obese. Among placebo-treated patients, the incidence rate of ESRD was substantially higher in obese patients than overweight patients (24 versus 11 events/100 person-years) or than those with normal BMI (10 events/100 person-years); we observed a similar pattern for the combined endpoint of ESRD or doubling of serum creatinine. Ramipril reduced the rate of renal events in all BMI strata, but the effect was higher among the obese (incidence rate reduction of 86% for ESRD and 79% for the combined endpoint) than the overweight (incidence rate reduction of 45 and 48%, respectively) or those with normal BMI (incidence rate reduction of 42 and 45%, respectively). We confirmed this interaction between BMI and the efficacy of ramipril in analyses that adjusted for potential confounders, and we observed a similar effect modification for 24-hour protein excretion. In summary, obesity predicts a higher incidence of renal events, but treatment with ramipril can essentially abolish this risk excess. Furthermore, the reduction in risk conferred by ramipril is larger among obese than nonobese patients.",

Blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) represent the cornerstone of the antihypertensive drug arsenal; however, in most patients, combination therapy is required. For many patients, a combination of RAAS blocker and calcium antagonist is the combination preferred by the treating physician. Often three or even four drugs are needed. Treatment should be individualized according to concomitant risk factors and diseases and depending on the age and hemodynamic and laboratory parameters of the patient.

Scleroderma renal crisis occurs in 2 to 5% of patients with systemic sclerosis, particularly those with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis in the first years of disease evolution. High-dose corticosteroid therapy (> 15 mg/d) is associated with an increased risk of scleroderma renal crisis. Patients present with prominent left heart failure and hypertensive encephalopathy. Renal failure can be associated with moderate proteinuria, without hematuria. Thrombotic microangiopathy is detected in 43% of the cases. Anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies are present in one third of patients with scleroderma renal crisis. In case of renal failure, iatrogenic or functional origin must be investigated, as well as crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) or thrombotic microangiopathy. Renal biopsy is not necessary to establish the diagnosis in typical forms of scleroderma renal crisis. However, it can help to evaluate the prognosis and it is recommended when clinical presentation of scleroderma renal crisis is unusual. The prognosis of scleroderma renal crisis dramatically improved with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, 5-year survival of patients who developed a scleroderma renal crisis is only 65%. The treatment relies on the early control of blood pressure with increasing doses of ACE inhibitors, in association with calcium channel blockers if necessary. In case of severe renal failure and/or hypertension, dialysis can help to quickly control the vascular overload and the blood pressure. Dialysis can be stopped in about half of cases. After 2 years on dialysis, eligible patients should be considered for renal transplantation. The prevention of scleroderma renal crisis lacks consensus.

    "817": "All patients with stable coronary artery disease require medical therapy to prevent disease progression and recurrent cardiovascular events. Three classes of medication are essential to therapy: lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet agents. Lipid-lowering therapy is necessary to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a target level of less than 100 mg per dL, and physicians should consider a goal of less than 70 mg per dL for very high-risk patients. Statins have demonstrated clear benefits in morbidity and mortality in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease; other medications that can be used in addition to statins to lower cholesterol include ezetimibe, fibrates, and nicotinic acid. Blood pressure therapy for patients with coronary artery disease should start with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If these medications are not tolerated, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers are acceptable alternatives. Aspirin is the first-line antiplatelet agent except in patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction or undergone stent placement, in which case clopidogrel is recommended. Anginal symptoms of coronary artery disease can be treated with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or any combination of these.

    "824": "A literature review was performed to collect information on the role of pharmacogenetics in six proposed teratogenic mechanisms associated with drug use during pregnancy: folate antagonism, oxidative stress, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor antagonism, cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 inhibition, 5-hydroxytryptamine-reuptake inhibition and drug transporters in the placenta. Data on the direct relationship between pharmacogenetics and drug-induced birth defects were found for folate metabolism, oxidative stress caused by phenytoin exposure and drug transporters in the placenta. Although no specific data to support pharmacogenetic-related birth defects were found for the NSAIDs, paroxetine and fluoxetine, it might be expected that polymorphisms modify their teratogenic effects. The usually low prevalence of drug-induced malformations impedes the demonstration of the contribution of pharmacogenetics. Large-scale studies, preferably case-control studies, are needed.", 
    "825": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an important zinc-dependent hydrolase responsible for converting the inactive angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and for inactivating the vasodilator bradykinin. However, the substrate binding mode of ACE has not been completely understood. In this work, we propose a model for an ACE Michaelis complex based on two known X-ray structures of inhibitor-enzyme complexes. Specifically, the human testis angiotensin-converting enzyme (tACE) complexed with two clinic drugs were first investigated using a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach. The structural parameters obtained from the 550 ps molecular dynamics simulations are in excellent agreement with the X-ray structures, validating the QM/MM approach. Based on these structures, a model for the Michaelis complex was proposed and simulated using the same computational protocol. Implications to ACE catalysis are discussed.", 
    "826": "Lymphatic filariasis is a major health problem in India with a large number of patients tending to be asymptomatic. In the Southeast and South Asian regions, Wuchereria bancrofti is the most prevalent parasite, causing filariasis in 99.4% of cases. While kidney involvement is a rare event in chronic filariasis, this case is unique because AA-type renal amyloidosis occurs in chronic W. bancrofti infection. We present here a unique case of lymphatic filariasis. The patient, a 25-year-old male who was previously diagnosed with right lower limb filarial lymphedema and had undergone lymphovenous anastomosis, was admitted for evaluation of persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria. Autoimmune markers in the form of anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative; C3 was normal. Urine analysis revealed inactive sediment with moderate proteinuria. Both serum and urine electrophoresis were negative for paraproteins and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were normal. Evidence of active filarial infection was established on the basis of microfilariae in the peripheral smear and a positive W. bancrofti antigen test. Kidney biopsy revealed renal amyloidosis when stained with Congo red and anti-AA immunostain. The patient's proteinuria improved on conservative management with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and a course of antifilarial drugs. His proteinuria returned to <1\u00a0g/24\u00a0h with normalization of renal function and no significant proteinuria on periodic follow-up at 6-month and 1-year intervals. Repeat kidney biopsy after 1.5\u00a0years showed regression of amyloidosis. Repeat demonstration of filarial antigen and microfilariae in the peripheral smear were negative on multiple occasions during the follow-up period. Although various chronic infections can lead to secondary renal amyloidosis, this is the first case reported in world literature where secondary amyloidosis developed as a complication of chronic filarial infection due to W. bancrofti. This is probably also the first case reported in world literature where renal amyloidosis has an etiological association with W. bancrofti infection and where patient symptoms improved with antifilarial and antiproteinuric management.",

Harmonic MSNAV was assessed by coarse graining spectral analysis. Both drugs lowered heart rate similarly (-13 \u00b1 2 beats/min; P < 0.001) but neither affected MSNA burst frequency (-7 \u00b1 4 bursts/min, not significant). Before \u03b2-blockade, harmonic MSNA power in the region encompassing 0.13 Hz was essentially absent. Beta-blockade increased the mean values for total power (from 0.00 to 0.50 Hz; 5.2 \u00b1 0.8 to 6.8 \u00b1 1.2U(2); P < 0.001) and for harmonic MSNA spectral power across the 0.1-0.22 Hz frequency range (from 0.48 \u00b1 0.10 to 1.50 \u00b1 0.32 U(2), F = 12.2; P < 0.001). Both carvedilol and metoprolol had a similar effect.",

A total of 60 patients aged 48-72 (mean 62 +/- 8.4) years with persistent symptoms of functional class II-IV CHI and left ventricular (LV) fraction = < 45% complicating CHD. They were divided into 3 groups of 20 patients each. Patients in group 1 were given losartan (50 mg daily), in group 2 lisinopril (10 mg daily), in group 3 combination of the two drugs for 24 weeks.

The control group was comprised of 82 patients that could not use either medicine for a variety of reasons. These patients developed signs of post-infarction left ventricular remodeling (enhanced MS and LVMM index, left ventricular spherization, cavity enlargement, systolic and diastolic LF dysfunction). Combined therapy arrested the remodeling process within 12 months after onset, reduced systolic MS, and promoted the tendency toward restoration of the LV geometric shape, size, diastolic and systolic function.",

    "848": "Fundamental research into molecular mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF) and improved understanding of processes involved in the initiation and maintenance of AF have transformed the traditional approach to its management by targeting only the electrical aspects, usually with antiarrhythmic drugs and, recently, by ablation. The antiarrhythmic potential of upstream therapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins, and n-3 (\u03c9-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids, extends beyond the benefit of treating underlying heart disease to modifying the atrial substrate and intervening in specific mechanisms of AF. The key target is structural remodelling of the atria, particularly inflammation and fibrosis, although there is evidence to suggest the direct involvement at the ion channel level. Positive clinical reports supported by robust experimental data have suggested that upstream therapies can be valuable strategies for primary prevention of AF in selected patients and have resulted in several class IIA recommendations in the new European guidelines on AF. However, these results have not been consistently replicated in the secondary prevention setting, and several recent randomized controlled studies failed to demonstrate any effect of upstream therapies on AF burden or on major cardiovascular outcomes. Part II of the review summarizes the evidence base for the use of upstream therapies for secondary prevention of AF.",

The development of inhibitors of \u03b2-secretase is thus critical to combating this disease, which threatens an ever increasing number of the population and grows in importance as the population ages. Herein we show that flavones from Morus lhou potently inhibit \u03b2-secretase. Our aim in this manuscript is to explore the inhibitory kinetics of natural compounds and develop a phamacophore model which details the critical features responsible for inhibitory activity. The IC(50) values of compounds for \u03b2-secretase inhibition were determined to range between 3.4 and 146.1 \u03bcM. Prenylated flavone 2 (IC(50)=3.4 \u03bcM) was 20 times more effective than its parent compound, noratocarpetin 1 (IC(50)=60.6 \u03bcM). The stronger activity was related with resorcinol moiety on B-ring and isoprenyl functionality at C-3. Kinetic analysis shows that the four effective compounds (1-4) have a noncompetitive mode of action. The binding affinity of flavones for \u03b2-secretase calculated using in silico docking experiments correlated well with their IC(50) values and noncompetitive inhibition modes.", 
    "856": "Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in developed countries. In spite of excellent glucose and blood pressure control, including administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, diabetic nephropathy still develops and progresses. The development of additional protective therapeutic interventions is, therefore, a major priority. Nuclear hormone receptors regulate carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, the immune response, and inflammation. These receptors also modulate the development of fibrosis. As a result of their diverse biological effects, nuclear hormone receptors have become major pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases. The increasing prevalence of diabetic nephropathy has led intense investigation into the role that nuclear hormone receptors may have in slowing or preventing the progression of renal disease. This role of nuclear hormone receptors would be associated with improvements in metabolism, the immune response, and inflammation. Several nuclear receptor activating ligands (agonists) have been shown to have a renal protective effect in the context of diabetic nephropathy. This review will discuss the evidence regarding the beneficial effects of the activation of several nuclear, especially the vitamin D receptor (VDR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and peroxisome-proliferator-associated receptors (PPARs) in preventing the progression of diabetic nephropathy and describe how the discovery and development of compounds that modulate the activity of nuclear hormone receptors may provide potential additional therapeutic approaches in the management of diabetic nephropathy.

    "857": "Hepatic fibrosis, which is characterized by progressive inflammation and deposition of extracellular matrix components, is a common response to chronic liver disease. Hepatic fibrogenesis is a dynamic process that involves several liver cell types including hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells. In addition, recent evidence indicates that bile duct epithelial cells (i.e. cholangiocytes) also participate in the progression of biliary fibrosis that is observed during chronic cholestatic liver diseases, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis. To date, there are no effective treatments for hepatic fibrosis. Several recent studies have demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in hepatic fibrosis. Therapies targeting the RAS may represent a promising paradigm for the prevention and treatment of hepatic fibrosis in the setting of chronic liver disease. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update on the role of RAS in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in both animal models and human studies. We will discuss the profibrotic mechanisms activated by the RAS and the cell types involved. Studies that have utilized angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to modulate the RAS in order to ameliorate hepatic fibrosis will also be discussed. Although the cumulative evidence supports the potential for the use of ARBs and ACE inhibitors as treatment for hepatic fibrosis, extensive studies of the effectiveness of RAS therapeutics are necessary in patients with chronic liver disease.", 
    "858": "We used data from patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) to assess the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (NOD) with \u03b2 blockers and to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition would modify this risk. The Prevention of Events with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) trial randomized 8,290 patients with stable CAD to trandolapril or placebo. Presence of NOD was assessed at each study visit over a median follow-up time of 4.8 years. We examined the risk of NOD associated with \u03b2-blocker use with Cox regression models adjusting for 25 baseline covariates and tested whether this risk was modified by randomization to the ACE inhibitor. Of 6,910 patients without diabetes mellitus at enrollment (1,179 women and 5,731 men, mean age 64 \u00b1 8 years), 4,147 (60%) were taking \u03b2 blockers and 733 (8.8%) developed NOD. We observed a significant interaction between \u03b2-blocker use and randomization to ACE inhibitor with respect to NOD (p = 0.028). Participants taking \u03b2 blockers assigned to the placebo group (n = 2,090) were at increased risk for NOD adjusting for baseline covariates (hazard ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 2.05, p <0.001), and this risk was attenuated in those assigned to trandolapril (n = 2,057, hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.42, p = 0.39). \u03b2 blocker use was associated with increased risk for NOD in patients with stable CAD, and this risk was decreased in patients treated concurrently with an ACE inhibitor. In conclusion, these data suggest that ACE inhibition may attenuate the risk for glucose abnormalities observed in patients taking \u03b2 blockers.",

The percentage difference between the brand name prescription reimbursement amount to Medicaid in the last 2 months of the 6-month extension and the generic prescription reimbursement amount to Medicaid in the first 2 months following exclusivity expiration was then calculated for each drug. This was done using data from the 5 months surrounding the exclusivity expiration by regressing the log-transformed Utah Medicaid reimbursement amount on an indicator for patent expiration, controlling for number of units, volume of sales, month filled and strength. This was used to estimate what the initial generic prescription price would have been without the 6-month patent extension and what costs would have been in the 18 months following the original expiration date if the patent extension had not been granted. Medicaid rebates were assumed to be 15.1% for branded products and 11% for generics.",

In the pivotal ONTARGET trial, which enrolled ACE inhibitor-tolerant patients at high vascular risk, telmisartan 80\u2009mg once daily added to existing, proven therapy was noninferior to ramipril 10\u2009mg once daily (the gold standard cardioprotective ACE inhibitor) in terms of CVD prevention. Moreover, telmisartan was better tolerated than ramipril, as reflected in, for example, lower incidences of permanent treatment discontinuations due to cough and angioedema. The placebo-controlled TRANSCEND and PRoFESS studies provided supporting evidence for the (time-dependent) effectiveness of telmisartan in preventing cardiovascular events, although the drug appeared to have neither a beneficial nor a harmful impact on cardiovascular mortality. The TRANSCEND trial also demonstrated that telmisartan was well tolerated in ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients at high vascular risk. On the basis of these findings, telmisartan can be considered an effective treatment option for CVD prevention in patients at high vascular risk. Consideration may be given to prescribing the drug as an alternative to ramipril in patients who are able to tolerate ACE inhibitors and, potentially, instead of ramipril in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors.", 
    "869": "Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) have beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular disease and in those with diabetes-related and diabetes-independent chronic kidney diseases. These beneficial effects are independent of the antihypertensive properties of these drugs. However, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and combinations of agents in these two classes are limited in the extent to which they inhibit the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Angiotensin breakthrough and aldosterone breakthrough may be important mechanisms involved in limiting the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Whether direct renin inhibitors will overcome some of the limitations of ACE-inhibitor and ARB therapy by blocking the deleterious effects of the RAAS remains to be proven. This important area is, however, in need of further investigation.",

    "875": "Essential hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction due to reduced availability of nitric oxide (NO) secondary to increased generation of oxygen-free radicals. Some antihypertensive drugs may improve or restore endothelial function independently of their blood pressure lowering effect. The newer generation of \u03b2-blockers, such as nebivolol and carvedilol, which provide antioxidant activity, can improve endothelial function in patients with hypertension. Dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists reverse impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in different vascular districts, through a mechanism related to an antioxidant effect. However, conflicting results are found in the brachial artery. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve endothelial function in subcutaneous, epicardial, brachial, and renal circulation, but they are ineffective in potentiating the impaired response to acetylcholine in the forearm of hypertensive patients. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists can restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to acetylcholine in subcutaneous microcirculation but not in that of the forearm muscle. They also improve basal NO release and decrease the vasoconstrictor effect of endogenous endothelin-1. Large-scale clinical trials are required to definitively demonstrate that treatment of endothelial dysfunction can improve the prognosis of patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "876": "Renin, an enzyme by cleaving angiotensinogen to angiotensin-I, controls the first and rate-limiting step of renin-angiotensin system that is associated with blood pressure. Thus Ligand and structure-based pharmacophore models were developed in this study to identify new potential leads inhibiting this rate-limiting enzyme as an efficient way to treat blood pressure. X-ray predicted binding modes of most active compounds were used in ligand-based approach whereas the 3D structural information of renin was used in structure-based approach. Pharmacophore models were validated using various methods and utilized in database searching to identify potential hits. Drug-like filters and molecular docking studies led us identifying the final hits to be employed in designing new class of future renin inhibitors.", 
    "877": "The separation of structurally related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lisinopril, cilazapril, ramipril and quinapril and their corresponding active diacid forms (prilates) by conventional TLC silica gel 60 plates was contrasted with that afforded by monolithic ultra-thin-layer chromatographic (UTLC) plates. For the use of UTLC plates technical modifications of the commercially available equipments for the sample application, development and detection were made. Plates were developed in modified horizontal developing chamber using ethyl acetate-acetone-acetic acid-water (4:1:0.25:0.5, v/v). Detection of the separated compounds was performed densitometrically in absorption/reflectance mode at 220 nm and after exposure to iodine also by image analysis. The obtained results showed that monolithic layer is more efficient for the separation of structurally similar polar compounds, such as prilates than conventional silica layers. Identification of the compounds was confirmed by ESI-MS after their on-line extraction from the UTLC and TLC plates by means of Camag TLC-MS interface.", 
    "878": "Autoimmune responses and inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases. There is compelling evidence that inflammatory mechanisms may contribute to progressive heart failure. Thus, myocardial infiltration of lymphocytes and mononuclear cells, increased expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines and circulating autoantibodies are frequently observed in myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) in rodents may be elicited by immunization of cardiac myosin and EAM in rats mimics human fulminant myocarditis in the acute phase and human DCM in the chronic phase. Our animal model, EAM was demonstrated to progress into the clinicopathological state similar to DCM in the chronic phase, and was found to be characterized by the enlargement of the heart, dilatation of ventricles, diffuse and extensive myocardial fibrosis, besides being a cellular immunity and inflammation mediated disease. Severity of myocarditis was characterized by increased inflammation, cardiac fibrosis and decreased myocardial performance in rats with DCM. Pharmacological interventions such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) significantly attenuated the myosin-induced inflammation and cardiac fibrosis and thereby improving myocardial function in rats with DCM. A growing body of evidence shows that ACEI and ARBs contribute to the pharmaceutical management of patients with heart failure mediated by immune and inflammatory response. The purpose of this review is to emphasize the role of inflammation and myocardial fibrosis in rats with DCM after EAM and study the effects of pharmacological interventions such as ACEI, ARBs in the treatment of heart failure through the suppression of inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis.", 
    "879": "Blood pressure variability in hypertension is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular complications, especially of stroke. Antihypertensive drugs/classes with powerful antihypertensive effect and suppression of blood pressure variability might have additional impact on the cardiovascular risk in clinical practice. Current evidence suggests that calcium channel blockers (CCB) decrease blood pressure variability more than all other antihypertensive classes. Combination of CCB with ACE-inhibitors suppresses blood pressure variability more than diuretics plus beta-blockers. Within-visit blood pressure variability (measured as coefficient of standard deviation) seems to be relatively simple and strong predictor of stroke and cardiovascular events.", 
    "880": "The pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease is a complex and dynamic process. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a potent and powerful mediator in the homeostasis of the cardiovascular and renal systems. RAAS blockade via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been consistently proven to be an effective and safe strategy for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients across a wide spectrum of risk. Although the beneficial effects of RAAS blockade may be due to its effects on central and peripheral blood pressure, there are many additional mechanisms to consider that may contribute additional protection. While a combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs has not yielded significantly positive results, the newer class of direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) may offer a novel and effective strategy for monotherapy as well as in combination.", 
    "881": "Chronic lead exposure causes hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Our purpose was to evaluate the effects of acute exposure to lead on arterial pressure and elucidate the early mechanisms involved in the development of lead-induced hypertension.", 
    "882": "Wistar rats were treated with lead acetate (i.v. bolus dose of 320 \u00b5g/Kg), and systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure and heart rate were measured during 120 min. An increase in arterial pressure was found, and potential roles of the renin-angiotensin system, Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and the autonomic reflexes in this change in the increase of arterial pressure found were evaluated. In anesthetized rats, lead exposure: 1) produced blood lead levels of 37\u00b11.7 \u00b5g/dL, which is below the reference blood concentration (60 \u00b5g/dL); 2) increased systolic arterial pressure (Ct: 109\u00b13 mmHg vs Pb: 120\u00b14 mmHg); 3) increased ACE activity (27% compared to Ct) and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity (125% compared to Ct); and 4) did not change the protein expression of the \u03b11-subunit of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, AT(1) and AT(2). Pre-treatment with an AT(1) receptor blocker (losartan, 10 mg/Kg) or an ACE inhibitor (enalapril, 5 mg/Kg) blocked the lead-induced increase of arterial pressure. However, a ganglionic blockade (hexamethonium, 20 mg/Kg) did not prevent lead's hypertensive effect.", 
    "883": "Acute exposure to lead below the reference blood concentration increases systolic arterial pressure by increasing angiotensin II levels due to ACE activation. These findings offer further evidence that acute exposure to lead can trigger early mechanisms of hypertension development and might be an environmental risk factor for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "884": "Angiotensin II (AngII) mediates progression of aortic aneurysm, but the relative contribution of its type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptors remains unknown. We show that loss of AT2 expression accelerates the aberrant growth and rupture of the aorta in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome (MFS). The selective AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) losartan abrogated aneurysm progression in the mice; full protection required intact AT2 signaling. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) enalapril, which limits signaling through both receptors, was less effective. Both drugs attenuated canonical transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling in the aorta, but losartan uniquely inhibited TGF\u03b2-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), by allowing continued signaling through AT2. These data highlight the protective nature of AT2 signaling and potentially inform the choice of therapies in MFS and related disorders.",

Exanthema and urticaria are the most common types of drug reactions. Urticaria may or may not be accompanied by angioedema or anaphylaxia. Possible life-threatening drug reactions include also toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and eosinophilia with systemic symptoms. A drug reaction resembles a typical allergic reaction. Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and anamnesis.",

Thus, early and effective control of high blood pressure may be considered an effective therapeutic approach, in order to reduce the burden of hypertension-related cardiovascular disease in future. In the past, due to the absence of prospective, long-term, randomized, controlled clinical trials performed in young hypertensive patients, lifestyle changes have been long seen as the only strategy to reduce high blood pressure levels. More recently, clinical data on the efficacy and safety of five major classes of antihypertensive drugs (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], beta-blockers, calcium-antagonists, and diuretics) have become available. In particular, these trials demonstrated dose-dependent blood pressure reductions and a good tolerability profile of several ARBs in hypertensive children and adolescents. An overview is provided of the clinical benefits of early detection and prompt intervention of high blood pressure levels, with a closer analysis of recent clinical trials, performed with olmesartan medoxomil in young subjects with hypertension.", 
    "887": "The aim of the study was to determine whether the reduction in brain grey matter volume associated with hypertension persisted or was remediated among hypertensive patients newly treated over the course of a year. A total of 41 hypertensive patients were assessed over the course of a 1-year successful anti-hypertensive treatment. Brain areas identified previously in cross-sectional studies differing in volume between hypertensive and normotensive individuals were examined with a semi-automated measurement technique (automated labelling pathway). Volumes of grey matter regions were computed at baseline after a year of treatment and compared with archival data from normotensive individuals. Reductions in regional grey matter volume over the follow-up period were observed despite successful treatment of blood pressure (BP). The comparison group of older, but normotensive, individuals showed no significant changes over a year in the regions tested in the treated hypertensive group. These novel results suggest that essential hypertension is associated with regional grey matter shrinkage, and successful reduction of BP may not completely counter that trend.",

A recent meta-analysis revealed an association between ARBs and tumour development, possibly due to enhancement of angiogenesis. However, published evidence is conflicting on the effects of ARBs on angiogenesis or the expansion of the existing vascular network. ARBs have been shown to exert primarily anti-angiogenic effects in basic science studies of cancer, retinopathy, peripheral artery disease and some models of cardiovascular disease. In animal and cellular models of myocardial infarction and stroke, however, ARB administration has been associated with robust increases in vascular density and improved recovery. The aim of the present review is to examine the angiogenic effects of ARBs in animal and cellular models of relevant disease states, including proposed molecular mechanisms of action of ARBs and the clinical consequences of ARB use.",

Cancer risk did not increase with increasing duration of ARB exposure (increase in rate ratio per year, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.00,) and was similar across individual ARBs. In subgroup analyses, there was a significant association between ARB use and cancer of male genital organs (rate ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.28), but no significantly increased risk of any of the other 15 cancer subgroups, including lung cancer (rate ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.02).

Therefore, in-hospital use of medications proved to decrease long-term mortality is a critical strategy to improve outcomes. Although endorsed in guidelines, predictors of initiation and continuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), \u03b2 blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have not been well studied. We assessed noncontraindicated use patterns for the 3 medications using the Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) registry from February 2009 through March 2010. Medication continuation was defined as treatment on admission and discharge. Multivariable logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was used to determine factors associated with discharge use. In total 9,474 patients were enrolled during the study period. Of those treated before hospitalization, overall continuation rates were 88.5% for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, 91.6% for \u03b2 blockers, and 71.9% for aldosterone-antagonists. Of patients untreated before admission, 87.4% had ACE inhibitors/ARBs and 90.1% had \u03b2 blocker initiated during hospitalization or at discharge, whereas only 25.2% were started on an aldosterone antagonist. In multivariate analysis, admission therapy was most strongly associated with discharge use (adjusted odds ratios 7.4, 6.0, and 20.9 for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, \u03b2 blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, respectively). Western region, younger age, and academic affiliation were also associated with higher discharge use. Although ACE inhibitor/ARB and \u03b2-blocker continuation rates were high, aldosterone antagonist use was lower despite potential eligibility. In conclusion, being admitted on evidence-based medications is the most powerful, independent predictor of discharge use.",

The primary etiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was ischemic heart disease (33.7%), hypertension (69.1%) and diabetes mellitus (25.8%). Our results demonstrated that ACE inhibitors significantly reduced all-cause mortality (odds ratio, OR = 0.52; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.41 to 0.64; P<0.01). Furthermore, ACE inhibitors were able to reduce heart failure related rehospitalization or treatment over 20.9 months (p<0.05) in a subgroup of patients aged over 75 years.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether lisinopril treatment has any biochemical alterations on renal tissue in L-NAME (N\u03b5-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) induced hypertension model. Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were included in this study and divided into four equal groups (n = 7): control group, L-NAME treated group (75 mg/kg/day), L-NAME plus lisinopril treated group and only lisinopril treated group (10 mg/kg/day). L-NAME and lisinopril were continued for 6 weeks. Systolic blood pressures were measured by using tail cuff method. In biochemical analysis, malondialdehyde (MDA, an index of lipid peroxidation) levels, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in renal tissues were used as markers of oxidative stress-induced renal impairment. Microalbumin and N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) in urine were determined as markers of renal tubular damage related to hypertension. Chronic L-NAME administration resulted in a significant depletion of serum nitric oxide (NO). When compared with control group, serum creatinine, microalbumin, urine NAG, renal tissue MDA level, and CAT activities were significantly high, while renal tissue SOD and GSH-Px activities low in L-NAME group. In the L-NAME plus lisinopril treated group, serum creatinine, microalbumin and urine NAG, renal MDA level and CAT activity decreased, whereas SOD, GSH-Px activities in renal tissue and serum NO levels were increased. Thus, lisinopril treatment reversed these effects. There were not any significant difference between L-NAME plus lisinopril treated group and control group concerning serum creatinine, renal tissue MDA level and SOD, GSH-Px, CAT activities. These results suggest that lisinopril could diminish biochemical alterations in L: -NAME induced hypertensive renal damage that occurs by oxidative stress.", 
    "901": "There is increasing interest in the relationship between host lifestyle factors and the outcomes of cancer treatment. Behavioral factors, comorbid conditions, and non-cancer-related pharmaceutical exposures may affect breast cancer (BC) outcomes. We used observational data from the LACE Study cohort (women with early stage BC from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Cancer Registry) to examine the association between beta blockers (BBs) and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and BC recurrence, BC-specific mortality, and overall mortality. Among 1,779 women, there were 292 BC recurrences, 174 BC deaths, and 323 total deaths. 23% were exposed to either a BB and/or an ACEi. These drugs were associated with older age, postmenopausal status, tamoxifen therapy, greater pre-diagnosis BMI, hypertension, and diabetes. In Cox proportional hazards models, ACEi exposure was associated with BC recurrence (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.02, 2.39, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04), but not cause-specific or overall mortality. Combined ACEi and BB were associated with overall mortality (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.22, 3.10, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). BB exposure was associated with lower hazard of recurrence and cause-specific mortality. However, there was no evidence of a dose response with either medication. For recurrence and cause-specific mortality, BB combined with ACEi was associated with a lower HR for the outcome than when ACEi alone was used. These hypothesis generating findings suggest that BC recurrence and survival were associated with exposure to two commonly used classes of anti-hypertensive medications. These observations need to be confirmed and suggest that greater attention should focus on the potential role of these commonly used medications in BC outcomes.",

Ovariectomy increased the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), NAD(P)H oxidase, and nitrotyrosine in the rat aorta. An over-production of angiotensin II and ROS was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(1177) in OVX rat aortae.

    "914": "Human muscle undergoes constant changes. After about age 50, muscle mass decreases at an annual rate of 1-2%. Muscle strength declines by 1.5% between ages 50 and 60 and by 3% thereafter. The reasons for these changes include denervation of motor units and a net conversion of fast type II muscle fibers into slow type I fibers with resulting loss in muscle power necessary for activities of daily living. In addition, lipids are deposited in the muscle, but these changes do not usually lead to a loss in body weight. Once muscle mass in elderly subjects falls below 2 standard deviations of the mean of a young control cohort and the gait speed falls below 0.8\u00a0m/s, a clinical diagnosis of sarcopenia can be reached. Assessment of muscle strength using tests such as the short physical performance battery test, the timed get-up-and-go test, or the stair climb power test may also be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Sarcopenia is one of the four main reasons for loss of muscle mass. On average, it is estimated that 5-13% of elderly people aged 60-70\u00a0years are affected by sarcopenia. The numbers increase to 11-50% for those aged 80 or above. Sarcopenia may lead to frailty, but not all patients with sarcopenia are frail-sarcopenia is about twice as common as frailty. Several studies have shown that the risk of falls is significantly elevated in subjects with reduced muscle strength. Treatment of sarcopenia remains challenging, but promising results have been obtained using progressive resistance training, testosterone, estrogens, growth hormone, vitamin D, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

    "918": "Intestinal absorption of temocapril, a prodrug of temocaprilat, was evaluated in an in situ rat jejunal perfusion model under various conditions of luminal pH and in the presence and absence of carboxylesterase-mediated hydrolysis. Temocapril was more easily taken up by mucosal cells at a luminal pH of 5.4 than at pH 6.4 or 7.4 and was extensively hydrolyzed to temocaprilat in mucosal cells. The hydrolysis was limited by the intrinsic clearance and the influx rate at luminal perfusate pHs of 5.4 and 7.4, respectively. Temocaprilat, derived from temocapril, was transported into both mesenteric vein and jejunal lumen according to pH partition theory. The net absorption of both temocapril and temocaprilat was highest at a luminal perfusate pH of 5.4. When both the luminal and venous fluid were at pH 7.4, temocaprilat was transported approximately 3-fold faster into the lumen than into the vein, due presumably to the greater surface area of the brush border membrane because of the presence of microvilli. Under carboxylesterase-inhibited conditions, the hydrolysis of temocapril was inhibited by only 50%. It is postulated that serine esterases located on the membranes of the epithelial cells were responsible for the residual hydrolysis. We have confirmed that temocapril is most easily absorbed in the proximal intestine after meals, due to prolongation of the gastric emptying time, the lower intraluminal pH caused by secretion of bile acid, and the interaction between serine esterases and the digesta.",

    "920": "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004 and 2007-2008 were analyzed to estimate treatment rates for medications proposed for inclusion in polypills (aspirin, statin, an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor, and a thiazide-type diuretic for those without and a \u03b2-blocker for those with a history of myocardial infarction) among US adults. The number of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke events potentially prevented through polypill use was projected by published meta-analyses and 3 large population-based cohort studies. Two polypill eligibility criteria were analyzed: (1) US adults \u226555 years and (2) US adults with a history of CVD.", 
    "921": "There are 67.6 million US adults \u226555 years and 15.4 million US adults with a history of CVD and, thus, eligible for polypills using the 2 outlined criteria. In 2007 to 2008, 37.3% of US adults \u226555 years and 57.0% of those with a history of CVD were taking statins. Use of other polypill medications was also low. Polypill use by US adults aged \u226555 years is projected to potentially prevent 3.2 million CHD events and 1.7 million strokes over 10 years. Among those with a history of CVD, the potential to prevent of 0.9 million CHD events and 0.5 million strokes is projected.",

    "923": "The majority of individuals with pre-diabetic states eventually appear to develop diabetes mellitus. During the pre-diabetic state, that may last many years, the risk of cardiovascular disease is modestly increased, with impaired glucose tolerance being slightly stronger predictor for future cardiovascular disease than impaired fasting glucose. The role of different antihypertensive drugs in the acceleration or the delay of diabetes onset is controversial. Agents that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are likely to be beneficial in the prevention of diabetes, while calcium channel blockers are thought to act metabolically neutral. In contrast, diuretics or \u03b2-blockers, and especially their combination, are thought to increase the incidence of diabetes. Carvedilol, a non-selective \u03b2-blocker with \u03b1(1)-blocking properties, and nebivolol, a third-generation highly selective \u03b2(1)- blocker with additional endothelial nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilator activity have been shown to have a favorable effect on glucose metabolism compared with others \u03b2-blockers. Nevertheless, the key goal still remains to reduce blood pressure, which may require combination of different antihypertensive drug classes. Changes from diuretics and \u03b2- blockers to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors certainly have cost implications. However, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be cheaper in the long run, due to less risk of new-onset diabetes and other metabolic disturbances. Thus, for patients with pre-diabetes it is wise to choose medications with the least diabetogenic potential and until more data are available, it seems prudent to restrict use of diuretics and classic \u03b2- blockers.", 
    "924": "Pancreatic cancers often develop in the context of pancreatic fibrosis caused by chronic pancreas inflammation, which also results in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), pancreatic parenchymal cell death, and stellate cell activation. Angiotensin II, which is converted from angiotensin I by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), stimulates ROS production via NADPH oxidase. In stellate cells, angiotensin II activates the stress-activated protein kinase p38. However, the molecular mechanism by which angiotensin II regulates pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis remains to be determined.", 
    "925": "Wistar Bonn/Kobori (WBN/Kob) rats spontaneously develop chronic pancreatic inflammation. To examine whether blockade of the renin-angiotensin system affects the development of pancreatic fibrosis, WBN/Kob rats were given angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker or ACE inhibitor (ACEI). Next, we assessed the role of angiotensin II and its possible downstream target p38\u03b1 in stellate cell activation using primary stellate cells.", 
    "926": "Treatment with AT1R blocker and ACEI prevented the development of chronic pancreatitis and fibrosis. In stellate cells, angiotensin II upregulated the expression of angiotensin II receptors, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2. In addition, p38\u03b1 was found to be essential to collagen type I production and \u03b1-SMA expression. ROS accumulation is enhanced in chronic pancreatic inflammation, which increases the risk of pancreatic cancer.",

    "928": "The effectiveness and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension have been confirmed during long-term use. Therefore, ACE inhibitors were selected as one candidate for the switch from ethical drugs to over-the-counter (OTC) medications. The objective of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis if ACE inhibitors were switched to OTC medications and used by grade I hypertension patients in Japan. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from a social perspective over a lifetime horizon using a Markov Model in 50-year-old men and women with grade I hypertension. They were divided into 3 groups: 1) untreated group; 2) consultation group visiting a clinic and receiving prescriptions for ACE inhibitors; and 3) OTC group purchasing OTC ACE inhibitors. The cost of OTC medications was estimated based on a previous study of willingness to pay (\u00a57,237/month). Average life expectancies in both the OTC and consultation groups were 20.20 for men and 22.63 for women, while in the untreated group it was 19.97 for men and 22.47 for women. Incremental costs per expected life-year (ICER) were \u00a51,743,557 for men and \u00a58,647,069 for women in the OTC group and \u00a53,819,861 for men and \u00a59,639,844 for women in the consultation group. These results suggest that longer life expectancies can be achieved with ACE inhibitors, and the total cost is decreased using OTC ACE inhibitors compared with ethical drugs. OTC ACE inhibitors therefore appear be a useful alternative for patients who do not have time to visit a clinic regularly.",

Safety, tolerability, and effects of aliskiren on neurohumoral biomarkers were assessed in patients who received (MRA+) and did not receive (MRA-) MRA treatment at baseline. Of the 302 randomized patients, 101 were receiving MRA treatment (aliskiren, n = 52; placebo, n = 49). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist status did not affect the ability of aliskiren 150 mg, added to standard HF therapy, to lower BNP, N-terminal proBNP, plasma renin activity, and urinary aldosterone. For example, the end-of-study to baseline ratio of geometric mean for BNP was: MRA+ group: aliskiren 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47, 0.98], placebo 0.85 (0.58, 1.24); MRA- group: aliskiren 0.62 (0.45, 0.84), placebo 0.85 (0.63, 1.15), interaction P= 0.720. The incidence of pre-specified adverse events (renal dysfunction, symptomatic hypotension, and hyperkalaemia) was low, and there were no significant differences between aliskiren and placebo in either MRA subgroup.",

    "932": "Cardiovascular diseases are one of the main causes of early morbidity and mortality within occidental world as well as in developing countries where they become a growing burden of public health. North-American recommendations and the ones of the European Society of Cardiology underline that medical treatment, risk factor management and life-style modifications are cornerstone of the treatment. Thanks to their impact on prognosis, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are obvious in stable coronary patients. Recently, some large trials have supported the benefits of combining calcium antagonist, amlodipine, and ACE inhibitor, perindopril, in patients with high cardiovascular risk, stable coronary patients or hypertensive patients. This combination has synergistic properties on blood pressure control and target-organ protection, thus reducing cardiovascular events over the long term.", 
    "933": "Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the western world. Despite major improvements in both prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy, there is a continuous need to improve identification and treatment of \"non-responders\". In recent years, several experimental studies have shown that aldosterone plays a role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, independent of angiotensin II and blood pressure levels. Blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with an ACE-inhibitor (ACEI) and/or ambulatory blood pressure should theoretically inhibit the secretion of aldosterone. However, an increase in aldosterone during long-term treatment with ACEIs, so-called aldosterone escape or aldosterone breakthrough, has been described. In the present thesis, our studies evaluating the incidence and clinical impact (i.e. a faster rate of decline in kidney function) of aldosterone escape in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy, possible mechanisms of aldosterone escape, and finally the beneficial effect of blocking aldosterone on albuminuria, blood pressure and renal autoregulation is being reviewed, together with some aspects of the existing treatment recommendations.", 
    "934": "Many small studies with varied surrogate end points and numerous preclinical data have suggested the likelihood of there being specific benefits that exceed simple blood pressure control with drug classes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers, which may be particularly relevant to the patient with diabetes and hypertension. Large clinical trials, however, have provided only token support for this idea. Likewise, meta-analyses that have incorporated varied clinical trials, albeit with somewhat heterogeneous data, have not been particularly forthcoming in their support of this concept. In the patient with diabetes and hypertension, tight blood pressure control, more so than using a specific drug class, is the most important aspect of therapy.", 
    "935": "Hypertension is common in patients with diabetes mellitus and is a main cause of renal and cardiovascular complications. There has been recent controversy on what should be considered the optimal blood pressure goal and the optimal antihypertensive agent. It has become apparent that one blood pressure does not fit all in diabetic patients. Major confounders are preexisting cardiovascular disease and presence or absence of proteinuric kidney disease. In proteinuric diabetic nephropathy, renin-angiotensin system blockade is clearly indicated, but monotherapy is practically always insufficient to achieve target blood pressure values.", 
    "936": "To find anti-hypertensive lead drug, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were synthesized and their effects on inhibiting ACE activity were investigated. ACE inhibitory peptides were synthesized via Fmoc solid-phase synthesis, isolated and purified through reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and identified by mass spectrometry. A RP-HPLC analysis method was used to test ACE inhibitory activity in vitro of these ACE inhibitory peptides. Six octapeptides were successfully synthesized, and the analytical results of mass spectrum were consistent with their theoretically calculated data. Among these synthetic octapeptides, the anti-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndromes) octapeptide had the most obvious ACE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 3.4 x 10(-5) mol x L(-1). So octapeptide AVLQSGFR-OH (anti-SARS peptide) was found to be the strongest candidate for potential development as an anti-hypertensive drug and had the implication of further study.", 
    "937": "Treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers (angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists) has shown clear benefits in distinct stages of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This treatment lowers blood pressure and prevents the appearance of markers of subclinical disease such as microalbuminuria, reduces cardiovascular and renal episodes in patients with subclinical lesions and prolongs survival in patients with clinical disease or organ dysfunction. Despite this unquestionable benefit, the residual risk in patients receiving these treatments often continues to be highly elevated and consequently strategies to reduce this risk are required. The present article reviews the options that may help to reduce cardiovascular disease. In addition to renin-angiotensin system blockers, these treatments include primary prevention in healthy individuals, stricter therapeutic goals, comprehensive risk control, more complete blocking of the renin-angiotensin system and the use of drugs with synergistic protective mechanisms.", 
    "938": "Aldosterone antagonists have been highly successful in treating congestive heart failure and resistant hypertension. Until recently, therapies targeting the mineralocorticoid receptor in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have received little attention, largely because of the risk of hyperkalemia and the incorrect assumption that traditional therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or both consistently reduces activity of the renin-angiotensin system in all patients. Control of extracellular volume and low-dose mineralocorticoid receptor blocker therapy may offer additional antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory benefits in select CKD populations.",

Studies were included if they measured adherence to antihypertensives using medication refill data and contained sufficient data to calculate a measure of relative risk of adherence and its variance. An inverse-variance-weighted random-effects model was used to pool results. Hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios were pooled separately, and HRs were selected as the primary outcome. Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled mean adherence by drug class ranged from 28% for \u03b2-blockers to 65% for angiotensin II receptor blockers. There was better adherence to angiotensin II receptor blockers compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (HR, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.57), calcium channel blockers (HR, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.38 to 1.79), diuretics (HR, 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.73 to 2.20), and \u03b2-blockers (HR, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 3.85). Conversely, there was lower adherence to diuretics compared with the other drug classes. The same pattern was present when studies that used odds ratios were pooled. After publication bias was accounted for, there were no longer significant differences in adherence between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or between diuretics and \u03b2-blockers.",

    "942": "Hypertension is prevalent in an estimated 29% to 80% of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). Cardiovascular disease represents the most common cause of mortality in this population, and hypertension (HTN) plays an important role. Volume overload is prevalent in PD patients because of liberal intake of fluids and loss of residual renal function (RRF). Noncompliance with salt restriction causes weight gain and makes HTN more difficult to manage. Physiology of the peritoneal membrane and its transport characteristics governs the ultrafiltration rate and consequently both volume and HTN. Therapeutic options for blood pressure control are ultrafiltration through the osmotic or colloid osmotic effects of dialysis solutions, salt restriction, and the use of antihypertensive medications such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Loop diuretics are used to maintain urine output in nonoliguric patients. Doses may exceed 250 mg of furosemide; ototoxicity is not problematic if blood levels are monitored carefully. Preservation of RRF is important for maintaining volume control and, thereby, control of HTN.",

In this device, the online labeling, electrophoresis separation and CL detection were compactly integrated onto a glass/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) hybrid microfluidic chip. CL detection was based on the oxidation reaction of N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI) and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) labeled thiol drugs with NaBrO. Four thiol drugs including 2-mercaptopropionylglycine (2-MPG), captopril (CP), 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) were employed as model compounds to examine the utility of the system. It was indicated that the separation and detection of four drugs can be completed within 90s. Detection limits (S/N=3) for the thiol drugs tested were in the range of 8.9\u00d710(-9)-13.5\u00d710(-9)M. The application of the present system was demonstrated by analyzing the thiol drugs in human plasma samples.",

    "946": "In human peritoneum, VDR and GCR are highly expressed (98.6% and 87.3% respectively). Except in the case of VDR (p = 0.0012), we observed no significant difference in receptor expression between the groups. Expression of ER and PR was sparse (11.4% and 31% respectively), with higher expression in women, and AR was absent. Minimal MMP9 expression and moderate TGF\u03b21 expression were observed in all groups. The differences between the groups were nonsignificant.", 
    "947": "Nuclear receptors are present in human peritoneum. Except in the case of VDR, the pattern for any one group is nonspecific. Glucocorticoids, vitamin D, and angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (via the vitamin D/angiotensin II pathway) might be suitable interventions for preservation of the integrity of the peritoneal membrane. The mechanism of action of tamoxifen is still not elucidated, ER expression in the peritoneum is sparse, and data about the studied pathways (MMP9, TGF\u03b2) are inconsistent.", 
    "948": "Despite the central role of tubular plasma proteins that characterize progressive kidney diseases, protein concentrations along the nephron in pathological conditions have not been quantified so far. We combined experimental techniques and theoretical analysis to estimate glomerular and tubular levels of albumin in the experimental model of 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) in the rat, with or without angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. We measured glomerular permselectivity by clearance of fluorescent Ficoll and albumin and used theoretical analysis to estimate tubular albumin. As expected, 5/6 Nx induced an elevation of the fractional clearance of the largest Ficoll molecules (radii >56 \u212b, P < 0.05), increasing the importance of the shunt pathway of the glomerular membrane and the albumin excretion rate (119 \u00b1 41 vs. 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 mg/24 h, P < 0.01). ACE inhibition normalized glomerular permselectivity and urinary albumin (0.5 \u00b1 0.3 mg/24 h). Theoretical analysis indicates that with 5/6 Nx, an increased albumin filtration overcomes proximal tubule reabsorption, with a massive increase in average albumin concentration along the tubule, reaching the highest value of >2,500 \u03bcg/ml at the end of the collecting duct. ACE inhibition improved glomerular permselectivity, limiting albumin filtration under proximal tubule reabsorption capacity, with low albumin concentration along the entire nephron, averaging <13 \u03bcg/ml at the end of the collecting duct. These results reinforce our understanding of the mechanisms of renal disease progression and the effects of angiotensin II antagonism. They also suggest that evaluation of tubular protein concentration levels could help to identify patients at risk of kidney disease progression and to improve clinical management.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have demonstrated reduced incidences of new-onset diabetes in patients with prediabetes or hypertension and in other cardiovascular populations; however, insight into the corresponding impact on cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality has been lacking. A recent trial (NAVIGATOR) was designed to evaluate incident diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes as part of its primary endpoint. In this trial, valsartan-based therapy reduced the incidence of new-onset diabetes by 14% relative to placebo over the 5-year follow-up period (P<.001). Cardiovascular outcomes, however, were not significantly affected by active treatment, which may be attributed to a number of potential confounding factors including the low rate of cardiovascular disease at baseline, concurrent implementation of lifestyle modification in all patients, and the substantial use of other risk-reducing agents.", 
    "952": "Angiotensin II has been implicated in a number of pathophysiologic processes with the potential to indirectly or directly influence the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Most clinical trials show a reduced risk of new-onset diabetes with RAAS blockade; however, recent results of the NAVIGATOR trial show that the addition of valsartan to lifestyle modification reduces the risk of diabetes, but does not improve cardiovascular outcomes.",

The aim of this study was to develop a new formulation of Enalapril maleate tablet and its comparative evaluation with other formulations of Enalapril maleate tablet that are listed in the local index of registered pharmaceutical products. To accomplish this task, a new formulation of Enalapril maleate tablet has been developed by direct compression method. All formulation tablets with 5mg potency were selected and the new formulation tablets were also developed with 5mg potency. For new formulation as well as for six available formulations of Enalapril maleate tablets, various pharmaceutical parameters namely weight variation, thickness, hardness test; friability test, disintegration test, dissolution test and pharmaceutical assay were performed in accordance with United States Pharmacopeias (USP). The results of all the above tests were within the specified limits as mentioned in USP, whereas hardness test results for two formulations were deviated from the specified limits. It is concluded that direct compression can be used as an alternate method for the manufacture of Enalapril maleate tablet.",

    "957": "Angioedema is a clinical syndrome characterized by episodes of transitory recurrent submucosal and subcutaneous oedema, called attacks. During an attack, the oedema may be localized at the level of the skin and/or ENT and digestive tract mucosa. This syndrome is not due to an allergic reaction. It is related to a C1 complement inhibitor deficiency or an increase in factor XII resulting in the excessive release of bradykinin, which leads to capillary permeability. There are hereditary and acquired forms, notably associated with the use of ACE inhibitors and sartans. This rare disease should be recognized by anaesthesiologists and intensive care and emergency physicians because, in the absence of specific treatment, it can be life-threatening due to the appearance of laryngeal oedema. In addition, there is a risk that the patient may have an attack during the perioperatory period, due to surgical trauma. International recommendations exist, and there are new molecules available in France. For moderate attacks, treatment is based on tranexamic acid. For hereditary forms, according to the localization and gravity of the attacks, emergency treatment is based on the use of Icatibant, a bradykinin B2 receptor inhibitor, and C1 inhibitor concentrate. For pregnant women and acquired forms, C1 inhibitor concentrate is the treatment of reference. Antalgic and perfusion treatments should not be neglected, and should be modified as a function of clinical signs. High-risk situations (perioperatory period, birthing, dental care) should be identified and short-term prophylaxis put in place before any procedure that may trigger an attack. Algorithms are proposed for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of attacks. Recommendations exist for during childbirth, in which case C1 inhibitor concentrate should be used.", 
    "958": "Bradykinin-mediated angioedema should be evoked in the case of recurrent and transitory oedema. Emergency management has evolved thanks to the commercialization of new molecules. Prevention of attacks during surgery and for during childbirth is important. The availability of C1 inhibitor concentrate in sufficient doses should be verified prior to the procedure. A multi-site reference centre (CREAK) has been created to help clinicians manage this disease. Patients with this disease should be identified in emergency departments. Health establishments, which cannot all have emergency stocks, should set up procedures for rapid provision or the transfer of patients to reference sites.",

We identified elderly hypertensive patients in whom ACEI/ARB therapy had been initiated after hospitalization for coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), or stroke and who were eligible for Medicare and state pharmacy assistance programs. Of 18,801 initiators of ACEIs and 2,641 initiators of ARBs, 2,535 died during the follow-up. We observed substantial differences in characteristics between ARB and ACEI initiators, suggesting that ARB users were more health seeking. The incidence of death and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in ACEI initiators was 77 and 22 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. The relative risk for SCD comparing ARB initiators to ACEI initiators was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.96); when the analysis was restricted to patients with low ejection fraction (EF), the relative risk was 1.1. The reduced risk of SCD can be explained, at least partly, by (i) residual confounding because ARB users were healthier on unobserved domains and (ii) lack of data on EF.", 
    "960": "Fluoride toxicity occurs due to high concentrations of fluoride in water sources or anthropogenic causes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of an Ayurvedic drug--Pankajakasthuri (PK)--in relation to fluoride-induced toxicity in mammalian lungs. The results indicated that sodium fluoride increased lipid peroxidation and decreased enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in a concentration-dependent manner in lungs. The antioxidant potential of the lungs was suppressed maximally at 10 ppm fluoride concentration and PK at all three dose levels (i.e., 100, 200 and 300 \u00b5l) decreased fluoride induced lipid peroxidation (p < 0.05) and increased the levels of total ascorbic acid, superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and FRAP values significantly (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. When PK was examined for its effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, in fluoride-induced toxicity, the ACE activity was found to increase (p < 0.0001) in lung homogenates with all three doses. This study indicates that PK, an Ayurvedic drug, improves mammalian lung function by increasing antioxidant potential and ACE activity under the conditions of fluoride toxicity.", 
    "961": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with an increased risk of early death in cardiovascular (CV) disease. The majority of PAD subjects are asymptomatic with a prevalence of 11 per cent among the elderly. Long-term drug prevention aiming to minimize disease progression and CV events in these subjects is probably beneficial, but expensive. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological risk reduction in subclinical PAD. Long-term costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated by employing a decision-analytic model for ACE-inhibitor, statin, aspirin and non-aspirin anti-platelet therapy. Rates of CV events without treatment were derived from epidemiological studies and event rate reduction were retrieved from clinical trials. Costs and health-related quality of life estimates were obtained from published sources. All four drugs reduced CV events. Using ACE-inhibition resulted in a heart rate (HR) of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.55-0.79), statins 0.74 (0.70-0.79), and clopidogrel 0.72 (0.43-1.00). Aspirin had a HR of 0.87 and the 95% CI passed included one (0.72-1.03). ACE-inhibition was associated with the largest reduction in events leading to the highest gain in QALYs (7.95). Furthermore, ACE-inhibitors were associated with the lowest mean cost \u20ac40.556. In conclusion, while all drugs reduced CV events, ACE-inhibition was the most cost-effective. These results suggest that we should consider efforts to identify patients with asymptomatic PAD and, when identified, offer ACE-inhibition.",

One of the mechanisms of hypertension development in postmenopausal women is believed to be the lack of estrogen leading to vasoconstriction due to both renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA)-sensitive and sodium-sensitive pathways. Nowadays, we have many medications of antihypertensive therapy, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in addition to diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers. The present review summarizes gender differences in the effects of ARB on blood pressure lowering and cardiovascular outcomes from the published reports of large-scaled, randomized clinical trials and its substudy on sex-specific difference.

    "995": "The effects of drug/silicate ratio and moisture content on chemical stability of amorphous quinapril hydrochloride (QHCl) coground with magnesium aluminometasilicates (Neusilin US2 and Neusilin FL2) were investigated. Amorphous QHCl/Neusilin samples containing 0-95% (w/w) Neusilin were prepared by cryogrinding. All samples were found to be amorphous and remained so for the duration of the study. The chemical stability of neat amorphous QHCl and QHCl coground with various percentages of Neusilin was studied at 40\u00b0C and at various moisture contents, as dictated by varying storage relative humidity (%RH). QHCl hydrolysis, forming a dicarboxylic acid (DCA) product, slightly increased with increasing percentages of Neusilin in the coground amorphous samples. On the contrary, QHCl cyclization, forming a diketopiperazine (DKP) product, was slow at both lower (e.g., 5%) and higher (e.g., 95%) percentages of Neusilin and markedly faster at intermediate percentages (e.g., 50%) of Neusilin. This complex effect of drug/silicate ratio on cyclization of quinapril was correlated with the surface acidity of the coground amorphous systems. For neat amorphous QHCl, increasing moisture resulted in increased DKP and DCA formation, as expected. Similarly, higher DCA formation was observed in QHCl/Neusilin coground amorphous samples with increasing moisture. However, DKP formation in coground amorphous samples was high both at lower (e.g., 0% RH) and higher (e.g., 75% RH) humidity, and low at intermediate (e.g., 48% RH) humidity. This complex relationship between DKP formation and moisture content for coground amorphous samples can be explained by the competitive adsorption of drug and water molecules on Neusilin surfaces, which was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Therefore, drug/silicate ratio, solid-state equivalent pH (surface acidity), and moisture have significant effects on chemical stability and should be considered in formulation and packaging optimization to develop both chemically and physically stable amorphous drug formulations using silicates.", 
    "996": "Autocrine, paracrine, endocrine, and neuroendocrine hormonal systems help regulate cardio-vascular and renal function. Any change in the balance among these systems may result in hypertension and target organ damage, whether the cause is genetic, environmental or a combination of the two. Endocrine and neuroendocrine vasopressor hormones such as the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), aldosterone, and catecholamines are important for regulation of blood pressure and pathogenesis of hypertension and target organ damage. While the role of vasodepressor autacoids such as kinins is not as well defined, there is increasing evidence that they are not only critical to blood pressure and renal function but may also oppose remodeling of the cardiovascular system. Here we will primarily be concerned with kinins, which are oligopeptides containing the aminoacid sequence of bradykinin. They are generated from precursors known as kininogens by enzymes such as tissue (glandular) and plasma kallikrein. Some of the effects of kinins are mediated via autacoids such as eicosanoids, nitric oxide (NO), endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), and/or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Kinins help protect against cardiac ischemia and play an important part in preconditioning as well as the cardiovascular and renal protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARB). But the role of kinins in the pathogenesis of hypertension remains controversial. A study of Utah families revealed that a dominant kallikrein gene expressed as high urinary kallikrein excretion was associated with a decreased risk of essential hypertension. Moreover, researchers have identified a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) that distinguishes the kallikrein gene family found in one strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) from a homologous gene in normotensive Brown Norway rats, and in recombinant inbred substrains derived from these SHR and Brown Norway rats this RFLP cosegregated with an increase in blood pressure. However, humans, rats and mice with a deficiency in one or more components of the kallikrein-kinin-system (KKS) or chronic KKS blockade do not have hypertension. In the kidney, kinins are essential for proper regulation of papillary blood flow and water and sodium excretion. B2-KO mice appear to be more sensitive to the hypertensinogenic effect of salt. Kinins are involved in the acute antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors but not their chronic effects (save for mineralocorticoid-salt-induced hypertension). Kinins appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and skin inflammation; they act on innate immunity as mediators of inflammation by promoting maturation of dendritic cells, which activate the body's adaptive immune system and thereby stimulate mechanisms that promote inflammation. On the other hand, kinins acting via NO contribute to the vascular protective effect of ACE inhibitors during neointima formation. In myocardial infarction produced by ischemia/reperfusion, kinins help reduce infarct size following preconditioning or treatment with ACE inhibitors. In heart failure secondary to infarction, the therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors are partially mediated by kinins via release of NO, while drugs that activate the angiotensin type 2 receptor act in part via kinins and NO. Thus kinins play an important role in regulation of cardiovascular and renal function as well as many of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on target organ damage in hypertension.", 
    "997": "Chronic heart failure is one of the most common causes of death in western countries. For heart failure with preserved systolic function thus far no reduction of mortality or morbidity could be demonstrated in clinical trials. Conversely, prognosis of systolic heart failure has been improved by the introduction of various drugs and devices in recent years. Since the publication of the latest heart failure guidelines, additional results from clinical studies have been obtained, which should be considered in patient treatment. In patients with severe systolic dysfunction the addition of low dose aldosterone antagonists to an ACE inhibitor and betablocker reduced mortality and hospitalizations already in functional class NYHA II. A resting heart rate above 70 bpm is an independent risk factor in systolic heart failure. If this high heart rate persists despite the maximal tolerated betablocker dose, isolated heart rate reduction by ivabradine may lower the rate of hospital admissions due to worsening heart failure. Iron deficiency should be substituted independently of the presence of anemia to improve symptoms and exercise capacity. In patients with severe systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction < 30 %) and a wide QRS complex \u2265 150 ms cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may be considered even when only mild symptoms are present to reduce hospitalizations.", 
    "998": "Functional performance influences quality of life in individuals with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and is also a powerful prognostic marker in these patients. The pathophysiology of impaired functional performance in patients with PAD is incompletely understood. The severity of atherosclerotic burden, non-invasively assessed by the ankle-brachial index (ABI), does not reliably predict the degree of functional impairment observed in PAD patients. We review associations of measures of arterial function (arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction) with functional performance in PAD patients, and also review potential therapies for arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction that could improve functional performance in PAD. Recent studies suggest that measures of arterial function, such as arterial stiffness and endothelial function, are associated with exercise performance in the setting of PAD. These studies have provided new insights into (1) the pathophysiology of functional impairment in PAD, (2) mechanisms of strategies known to be effective such as walking programs, and (3) potential new therapeutic interventions for improving functional performance. Thus, therapies aimed at arterial 'de-stiffening' and improving endothelial function (such as aerobic exercise, statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) may improve functional performance in patients with PAD; however, further investigations are needed.", 
    "999": "In the multidisciplinary practice guideline 'Heart failure 2010', the diagnosis of heart failure relies on a combination of signs and symptoms and on supplementary investigation with natriuretic peptides and echocardiography. Once diagnosed, it is important to detect the potentially treatable cause of the heart failure. The non-medical treatment consists of lifestyle advice, of which regular body exercise is the most important component. The medical treatment of patients with systolic heart failure consists of a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, and beta-blocker, optionally extended by an aldosterone antagonist, an angiotensin receptor blocker and/or digoxin. A restricted group of patients may require an internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) and/or cardiac resynchronisation therapy. There is limited scientific evidence concerning treatment of patients with diastolic heart failure. It is important to coordinate the care of the patient with heart failure within a multidisciplinary team to provide optimal treatment and information for the patient.", 
    "1000": "Two women aged 26 and 41 were diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). They presented with shortness of breath and oedematous ankles. The first woman presented in her 37th week of pregnancy. Her father had had dilated cardiomyopathy. A caesarean section was carried out. Her left ventricular function declined and she was therefore treated by means of an Impella heart pump and later, a left-ventricular assisting device. She eventually underwent urgent heart transplantation and recovered. The second woman presented 6 weeks after having given birth to twins. She was treated with a diuretic, an ACE inhibitor, a beta blocker and recovered. PPCM is a rare and potentially life-threatening form of dilated cardiomyopathy with left-ventricular systolic dysfunction that affects women in late pregnancy or in the early puerperium. Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The generation of a cardiotoxic prolactin subfragment appears to play a key role in the pathophysiology. PPCM is difficult to diagnose as the initial complaints may be interpreted as the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy. In addition, prior definitions emphasising strict time windows, the lack of awareness and the rarity of the full-blown disease have sometimes resulted in the condition being overlooked and misdiagnosed.",

Among all the echocardiographic parameters, LAD correlated best with BNP (r = 0.343, p < 0.001). Stepwise regression analysis showed that LAD (\u03b2 coefficient = 0.513, p < 0.001) was independently associated with BNP. Left atrial enlargement, rather than left ventricular hypertrophy, may be clinically useful for predicting elevated BNP levels in treated hypertensive patients.",

It was previously found that milk fermented with Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101 (101FM) or Lactobacillus plantarum NTU 102 (102FM) has ACEI and GABA activities. This study aimed to investigate the antihypertensive effects of 101FM and 102FM orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Eight hours after a single oral administration or after 8 weeks of weekly (chronic) administration, 101FM and 102FM significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the SHRs. Microscopic examination of aortic tissue demonstrated that 101FM and 102FM reduced the disorganization of the media layer. These findings suggest that orally administered 101FM and 102FM have antihypertensive effects, possibly via ACEI and GABA activity, in SHRs. Therefore, 101FM and 102FM may be useful ingredients in physiologically functional foods to prevent hypertension.",

We determined whether Gd affects vascular reactivity to contractile responses to phenylephrine (PHE) by blocking aortic ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase). Wistar rats of both sexes (260-300 g, 23 females, 7 males) were used. Experiments were performed before and after incubation of aortic rings with 3 \u00b5M Gd. Concentration-response curves to PHE (0.1 nM to 0.1 mM) were obtained in the presence and absence of endothelium, after incubation with 100 \u00b5M L-NAME, 10 \u00b5M losartan, or 10 \u00b5M enalaprilat. Gd significantly increased the maximum response (control: 72.3 \u00b1 3.5; Gd: 101.3 \u00b1 6.4%) and sensitivity (control: 6.6 \u00b1 0.1; Gd: 10.5 \u00b1 2.8%) to PHE. To investigate the blockade of E-NTDase activity by Gd, we added 1 mM ATP to the bath. ATP reduced smooth muscle tension and Gd increased its relaxing effect (control: -33.5 \u00b1 4.1; Gd: -47.4 \u00b1 4.1%). Endothelial damage abolished the effect of Gd on the contractile responses to PHE (control: 132.6 \u00b1 8.6; Gd: 122.4 \u00b1 7.1%). L-NAME + Gd in the presence of endothelium reduced PHE contractile responses (control/L-NAME: 151.1 \u00b1 28.8; L-NAME + Gd: 67.9 \u00b1 19% AUC). ATP hydrolysis was reduced after Gd administration, which led to ATP accumulation in the nutrient solution and reduced ADP concentration, while adenosine levels remained the same. Incubation with Gd plus losartan and enalaprilat eliminated the pressor effects of Gd. Gd increased vascular reactivity to PHE regardless of the reduction of E-NTPDase activity and adenosine production. Moreover, the increased reactivity to PHE promoted by Gd was endothelium-dependent, reducing NO bioavailability and involving an increased stimulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II AT1 receptors.",

Finally, we look at the future of CRT and how its indications can be expanded to benefit more patients in the future.", 
    "1014": "There are no existing guidelines supporting the withdrawal or continuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists in the preoperative setting. RAAS antagonists include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 blockers and direct renin inhibitors (eg, aliskiren), as well as the aldosterone antagonists. The use of these agents before surgery has been associated with a variable incidence of hypotension during the initial 30&emsp14;min after induction of anaesthesia; however, these hypotensive episodes have not been conclusively linked to any significant postoperative complications, although recent data suggest an increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Further studies are required to be able to demonstrate if the organ-protective benefits of RAAS antagonists justify their continuation in the perioperative setting. Temporary withdrawal of RAAS antagonists in these patients may prevent or attenuate intraoperative hypotension and hypovolaemia. Alternatively, the increase in RAAS activity and blood pressure expected with cessation of RAAS antagonist therapy may impair regional circulation secondary to an increase in systemic vascular resistance. Full discussion of the potential implications of perioperative RAAS antagonist therapy with the surgical team is important, and strategies to ensure careful monitoring and maintenance of adequate intravenous volume before induction of anaesthesia are essential.", 
    "1015": "BACKGROUND Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients is a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular events. Although resting EF as measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), contrast ventriculography (CNV), and radionuclide angiography (RNA) exhibit high correlation, there is only modest agreement between these modalities. This study sought to explore whether modality of EF assessment influences prognostication of post-MI patients with normal or slightly reduced EF. METHODS AND RESULTS The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) limited access dataset of the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) Trial (1996-2003, n=8290) comparing trandolapril versus placebo was used. The cohort was partitioned into TTE (n=2582), RNA (n=816), and CNV (n=1155) groups based on modality of EF assessment. EF was a significant predictor of cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.98; p<0.005) and all cause mortality (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99; p=0.0002) on multivariate analysis in this population with preserved or mildly depressed EF. Although CNV, TTE, and RNA groups differed significantly in terms of baseline variables, no appreciable differences were noted between RNA (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.50; ns) and CNV (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.27; ns) groups, compared with TTE for all cause mortality. Similarly, no significant differences were observed for cardiovascular mortality between RNA (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.84; p=0.31) and CNV (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.67, p=0.49) versus TTE. CONCLUSION EF is a significant predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with preserved or mildly depressed EF. Modalities of EF measurement are interchangeable and do not play a significant role in prognostication in a post-MI population.", 
    "1016": "Many patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), a common condition with high morbidity and mortality rates, receive treatment in primary care. To improve the management of CHF in primary care, we developed an implementation programme comprised of educational and organisational components, with support by a practice visitor and focus both on drug treatment and lifestyle advice, and on organisation of care within the practice and collaboration with other healthcare providers. Tailoring has been shown to improve the success of implementation programmes, but little is known about what would be best methods for tailoring, specifically with respect to CHF in primary care.", 
    "1017": "We describe the study protocol of a cluster randomised controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of tailoring a CHF implementation programme to general practices compared to a standardised way of delivering a programme. The study population will consist of 60 general practitioners (GPs) and the CHF patients they include. GPs are randomised in blocks of four, stratified according to practice size. With a tailored implementation programme GPs prioritise the issues that will form the bases of the support for the practice visits. These may comprise several issues, both educational and organizational.The primary outcome measures are patient's experience of receiving structured primary care for CHF (PACIC, a questionnaire related to the Chronic Care Model), patients' health-related utilities (EQ-5D), and drugs prescriptions using the guideline adherence index. Patients being clustered in practices, multilevel regression analyses will be used to explore the effect of practice size and type of intervention programme. In addition we will examine both changes within groups and differences at follow-up between groups with respect to drug dosages and advice on lifestyle issues. Furthermore, in interviews the feasibility of the programme and goal attainment, organisational changes in CHF care, and formalised cooperation with other disciplines will be assessed.", 
    "1018": "In the tailoring of the programme we will present the GPs a list with barriers; GPs will assess relevance and possibility to solve these barriers. The list is rigorously developed and tested in various projects. The factors for ordering the barriers are related to the innovation, the healthcare professional, the patient, and the context.CHF patients do not form a homogeneous group. Subgroup analyses will be performed based on the distinction between systolic CHF and CHF with preserved left ventricular function (diastolic CHF).",

    "1020": "Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and is the leading cause of blindness amongst working-age adults in Western countries. Large observational and randomized studies have consistently shown that optimal blood glucose and blood pressure control is the key component of intervention strategies aimed to halt or regress the disease, and limit the risk of progression to the proliferative stage, with consequent visual loss up to blindness in most severe cases. Amelioration of dyslipidemia by statins, especially if combined with fenofibrate, may also ameliorate retinopathy in line with a potential pathogenic role of hyperlipidemia. Recently, evidence has also emerged that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors may electively prevent or delay progression of retinopathy, possibly because of specific protective effect against the structural and functional retinal changes sustained by local RAS activation. Thus, metabolic and blood pressure control by RAS inhibition is to prevent or limit the onset of retinopathy and its progression towards visual-threatening stages. Topic treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents is emerging as a treatment option for retinopathy in advanced stages to limit the need for laser photocoagulation. This option however should be considered with caution due to the risk of systemic adverse events.", 
    "1021": "The applicability of three different ionization techniques: atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) was tested for the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of five target pharmaceuticals (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, bezafibrate, enalapril and orlistat) in wastewater samples. Performance was compared both by flow injection analysis (FIA) and on-column analysis in deionized water and wastewater samples. A column switching technique for the on-line extraction and analysis of water samples was used. For both FIA and on-column analysis, signal intensity and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the target analytes in the three sources were studied. Limits of detection and matrix effects during the analysis of wastewater samples were also investigated. ESI generated significantly larger peak areas and higher S/N ratios than APCI and APPI in FIA and in on-column analysis. ESI was proved to be the most suitable ionization method as it enabled the detection of the five target compounds, whereas APCI and APPI ionized only four compounds.",

    "1023": "Adult subjects with a serum potassium concentration above 6.5\u2009mmol/L detected at admission or during hospital stay in nephrology, cardiology, geriatric, emergency or intensive care units were identified by biology laboratories of hospitals and clinics located in Midi-Pyrenees (southwest France). Patients dialyzed for end-stage kidney disease were excluded. Data were collected from medical files. Hyperkalemia was defined as drug-associated if at least one drug known to increase serum potassium concentration was taken when hyperkalemia occurred (among drugs taken in outpatient care for hyperkalemia detected at admission and among drugs taken in outpatient care and continued at hospital and drugs introduced from admission for hyperkalemia detected during hospital stay).", 
    "1024": "Of 168 hyperkalemia cases, 102 (60.7%) were classified as drug-associated. They concerned elderly patients (mean age: 76.1\u2009years) often having arterial hypertension and/or cardiac diseases (88.2%). Risk factors, mainly acute kidney failure, were observed in almost all cases (98.0%). Drugs predominantly involved were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (47.1%), spironolactone (41.2%), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (23.5%) and potassium supplements (23.5%). In 10% of cases, death could be attributed to hyperkalemia.", 
    "1025": "Laboratory databases allowed an exhaustive identification of hyperkalemia cases. The frequency of drug-related hyperkalemia and their characteristics suggest that treatment with drugs known to increase serum potassium concentration can be inappropriate, especially regarding associations or indications, and is highly risky for predisposed patients.", 
    "1026": "The purpose of this report is to review available and emerging antihypertensive treatment options in light of current guidelines and evidence from large clinical trials. The published literature was reviewed for evidence regarding first-line options for antihypertensive agents, including thiazide-type diuretics, as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy. Current guidelines recommend using thiazide-type diuretics as first-line therapy alone or in combination with another agent. Other commonly used antihypertensive agents include calcium channel blockers, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren. These agents are associated with varying degrees of evidence that they may provide protection from cardiovascular or renal disease beyond that associated with blood pressure reduction. Thiazide diuretics are inexpensive and effective but may not be preferable to other classes of antihypertensives that reduce blood pressure to a similar extent with a better safety profile and superior reductions in cardiovascular event rates. However, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors also show promise as initial monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy regimen. In patients requiring additional blood pressure reduction, add-on therapy with a diuretic could provide additional blood pressure-lowering efficacy.",

    "1028": "Carvedilol was used to treat HF in 51 patients with a UVH, classified into 3 groups: after the Fontan operation (F), after the bidirectional Glenn operation (G), and patients who had not undergone Fontan or Glenn operation (NF). Carvedilol therapy was started at a mean age of 10 \u00b1 12 years (range: 1 month to 34 years). The initial and maximum doses of carvedilol were 0.04 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.42 \u00b1 0.29 mg \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 day(-1), respectively. After a mean follow-up of 11 months, the cardiothoracic ratio improved from 60 \u00b1 8 to 58 \u00b1 8% (P<0.01), and the dosage of furosemide was reduced from 1.4 \u00b1 0.9 to 0.7 \u00b1 0.7 mg \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 day(-1) (P < 0.01). The ejection fraction also improved from 35 \u00b1 12 to 40 \u00b1 11% (P < 0.05), and this improvement was prominent in the F group (from 35 \u00b1 15 to 45 \u00b1 9%; P < 0.05).

    "1030": "Early detection of unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance saves lives and prevents harmful consequences. We propose a novel data mining approach to signaling potential ADRs from electronic health databases. More specifically, we introduce potential causal association rules (PCARs) to represent the potential causal relationship between a drug and ICD-9 (CDC. (2010). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). [Online]. Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.html) coded signs or symptoms representing potential ADRs. Due to the infrequent nature of ADRs, the existing frequency-based data mining methods cannot effectively discover PCARs. We introduce a new interestingness measure, potential causal leverage, to quantify the degree of association of a PCAR. This measure is based on the computational, experience-based fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we developed previously (Y. Ji, R. M. Massanari, J. Ager, J. Yen, R. E. Miller, and H. Ying, \"A fuzzy logic-based computational recognition-primed decision model,\" Inf. Sci., vol. 177, pp. 4338-4353, 2007) on the basis of the well-known, psychology-originated qualitative RPD model (G. A. Klein, \"A recognition-primed decision making model of rapid decision making,\" in Decision Making in Action: Models and Methods, 1993, pp. 138-147). The potential causal leverage assesses the strength of the association of a drug-symptom pair given a collection of patient cases. To test our data mining approach, we retrieved electronic medical data for 16,206 patients treated by one or more than eight drugs of our interest at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit between 2007 and 2009. We selected enalapril as the target drug for this ADR signal generation study. We used our algorithm to preliminarily evaluate the associations between enalapril and all the ICD-9 codes associated with it. The experimental results indicate that our approach has a potential to better signal potential ADRs than risk ratio and leverage, two traditional frequency-based measures. Among the top 50 signal pairs (i.e., enalapril versus symptoms) ranked by the potential causal-leverage measure, the physicians on the project determined that eight of them probably represent true causal associations.", 
    "1031": "A comparative effectiveness review (CER) published by the University of Connecticut Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) in 2009 found strong evidence that ACE inhibitors reduced total mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) in comparison to placebo among adults with stable IHD and preserved ventricular function, but increased the risk for syncope and cough. There was low to moderate evidence that ARBs reduced a composite of cardiovascular endpoints compared to placebo, and these agents were well-tolerated. The one available study directly comparing the impact of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with IHD revealed no significant difference between the classes in the rate of cardiovascular outcomes, but demonstrated higher rates of cough and angioedema among patients treated with ACE inhibitors, and higher rates of hypotensive symptoms among patients treated with ARBs. A list of research gaps is a common component of CERs and is an important step in outlining a future research agenda; however, such lists do not always clearly suggest how future research should be prioritized, or which projects are in fact feasible. In this pilot project, we sought to expand on the work done by the University of Connecticut EPC to identify and prioritize gaps in the evidence supporting the comparative effectiveness of ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy in patients with IHD. The prioritization process we used combined a review of recently published and ongoing studies, engagement of nine stakeholders, and participation of these stakeholders in both qualitative and quantitative exercises of research needs prioritization.", 
    "1032": "The plasma concentration of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) is a st-rong prognostic indicator for patients with heart failure (HF) across all stages of the condition. Several clinical trials have de-monstrated convincingly that neurohormonal modulation on the renin angiotensin system (RAS) decreases plasma NT-pro-BNP level and results in favorable outcomes. But there are still limited comparative data on the neuro-hormonal modulatory effects of two RAS inhibitors: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker.", 
    "1033": "This study was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, controlled, and non-inferiority study involving 445 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 45%. Patients were assigned to receive either valsartan (target dose of 160 mg bid) or enalapril (target dose of 10 mg bid) for 12 months. We compared plasma NT-pro-BNP, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level and echocardiographic parameters before and after treatment with valsartan or enalapril.", 
    "1034": "The NT-pro-BNP and hs-CRP levels were significantly decreased after 12 months of treatment with valsartan and enalapril. The percentage change was similar between both groups. LVEF improved and left ventricular internal dimensions were decreased in both groups, and there were no significant differences between two groups.",

    "1036": "Discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment is known to be different for different classes of antihypertensive drugs. No information is available on whether this phenomenon differs for drugs belonging to the same class. This is clinically relevant because treatment discontinuation is mainly responsible for poor blood pressure control in the antihypertensive population.", 
    "1037": "We studied a large (n=131,472) cohort of patients aged 40-80 years who lived in Lombardy (Italy) and received their first antihypertensive drug prescription during 2005. Discontinuation was defined by the absence of any antihypertensive drug prescription during the 90-day period following the end of the latest prescription. Class-related and drug-related discontinuation rates were standardized according to the demographic and therapeutic structure of the entire cohort and expressed as number of patients who experienced discontinuation every 100 person-months.", 
    "1038": "Standardized rates of discontinuation ranged from 6.2 to 24.4 events every 100 person-months for patients who started monotherapy with an angiotensin receptor antagonist and a diuretic, respectively. However, there was a significant heterogeneity between treatment discontinuation rates within each class and the heterogeneity differed between classes. The highest discontinuation rate was 13.9-fold for channel blockers, but only 1.7-fold for angiotensin receptor antagonists. Within this class, losartan showed a discontinuation rate significantly greater than that of the other angiotensin receptor antagonists whose discontinuation rate was similar. A significant heterogeneity also characterized initial treatment with fixed-dose combinations of different angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists with a diuretic.", 
    "1039": "Comparison of treatment discontinuation between antihypertensive drug classes masks the fact that this phenomenon is heterogeneous within any given class. This is relevant to calculations of the cost-benefit of treatment, which, thus, should be drug-based rather than class-based.", 
    "1040": "The present study evaluated whether enalaprilat (the active form of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) activates B(1) receptors. We observed that the levels of B(1) receptor mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in the kidneys of diabetic rats. Bradykinin (BK)-induced renal vasodilation decreased in isolated perfused kidneys of diabetic rats, but des-Arg(9)-BK-induced renal vasodilation increased. Enalaprilat also produced vasodilation in the isolated perfused kidneys of control and diabetic rats. The response to des-Arg(9)-BK or enalaprilat was blocked by Lys-(des-Arg(9), Leu(8))-BK (a B(1) receptor antagonist) and N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase). These results suggest that enalaprilat activates B(1) receptors and stimulates the production of nitric oxide in the kidneys of both control and diabetic rats.", 
    "1041": "The development of a rapid and selective capillary electrophoresis method for the quantitation of ramipril and its eight main impurities in pharmaceutical dosage form is described. Ramipril and three of its impurities contain a proline-similar moiety which causes in solution the presence of interconverting cis-trans isomers with respect to the amide bond. The interplay between electrophoretic migration and isomerization may yield the presence of an undesired interconversion zone between the two isomer peaks in the electropherogram, depending on the experimental conditions. Different capillary electrophoresis operative modes and pseudostationary phases were evaluated, both in normal and reverse polarity, in order to find the essential analytical parameters which could make it possible to overcome this issue and thus accurately quantify the analytes. The best results were obtained by using microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography in reverse polarity, where all the compounds which undergo cis-trans interconversion migrate as a single narrow peak. Experimental design led to identification of the following optimised conditions: background electrolyte, microemulsion made by 88.95% of 90 mM phosphate pH 2.5, 1.05% of n-heptane and 10.00% of SDS/n-butanol in 1:2 ratio; voltage, -26 kV; temperature, 17\u00b0C. Applying these conditions, the baseline separation of the analytes was obtained in about 10 min. Validation of the method following ICH guidelines was carried out and the procedure was applied to a real sample of ramipril tablets.",

Transplant recipients and general beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) events were identified by diagnosis codes. The healthcare process measures of interest comprised prescription fills for beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-2 receptor blockers, and \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) within 60 days after AMI. Medication use was compared in transplant and general patients by multivariable regression and by one-to-one matching for demographic and clinical factors including comorbidities and revascularization status.", 
    "1044": "We identified 192 kidney transplant recipients and 52,021 general patients who survived with insurance benefits more than or equal to 60 days after AMI diagnosis. In multiple logistic regression, transplant status was independently associated with increased likelihood of beta-blocker (adjusted odds ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.70-3.68; P<0.0001) and statin (adjusted odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.48; P=0.0006) use after AMI. Similarly kidney transplant recipients with AMI more commonly received beta-blockers (83.0% vs. 65.9%; P=0.0001) and statins (72.0% vs. 62.6%; P=0.04) compared with matched controls. Use of antiplatelet agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-2 receptor blockers did not differ significantly by transplant status.", 
    "1045": "Although kidney transplant status does not seem to be a barrier to medication use after AMI, there may be opportunities for improving cardiovascular risk management in high-risk transplant recipients. Administrative records offer a practical tool for monitoring cardiovascular complications and healthcare delivery not tracked in national registries."
