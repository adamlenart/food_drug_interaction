In the present study we investigated if the GABA(A) receptors in the lateral parabrachial nucleus are involved in the control of water, NaCl and food intake in rats. Male Holtzman rats with stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally into the lateral parabrachial nucleus were used. Bilateral injections of muscimol (0.2 nmol/0.2 microl) into the lateral parabrachial nucleus strongly increased 0.3 M NaCl (20.3+/-7.2 vs. saline: 2.6+/-0.9 ml/180 min) without changing water intake induced by the treatment with the diuretic furosemide combined with low dose of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril s.c. In euhydrated and satiated rats, bilateral lateral parabrachial nucleus injections of muscimol (0.2 and 0.5 nmol/0.2 microl) induced 0.3 M NaCl intake (12.1+/-6.5 and 32.5+/-7.3 ml/180 min, respectively, vs. saline: 0.4+/-0.2 ml/180 min) and water intake (5.2+/-2.0 and 7.6+/-2.8 ml/180 min, respectively, vs. saline: 0.8+/-0.4 ml/180 min), but no food intake (2+/-0.4 g/240 min vs. saline: 1+/-0.3 g/240 min). Bilateral lateral parabrachial nucleus injections of the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline (1.6 nmol/0.2 microl) abolished the effects of muscimol (0.5 nmol/0.2 microl) on 0.3 M NaCl and water intake. Muscimol (0.5 nmol/0.2 microl) into the lateral parabrachial nucleus also induced a slight ingestion of water (4.2+/-1.6 ml/240 min vs. saline: 1.1+/-0.3 ml/240 min) when only water was available, a long lasting (for at least 2 h) increase on mean arterial pressure (14+/-4 mm Hg, vs. saline: -1+/-1 mm Hg) and only a tendency to increase urinary volume and Na+ and K+ renal excretion. Therefore the activation of GABA(A) receptors in the lateral parabrachial nucleus induces strong NaCl intake, a small ingestion of water and pressor responses, without changes on food intake.", 
    "1": "Hypertension afflicts over 65 million Americans and poses an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity such as stroke, myocardial infarction and end-stage renal disease resulting in significant mortality. Overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been identified as an important determinant that is implicated in the etiology of these diseases and therefore represents a major target for therapy. In spite of the successes of drugs inhibiting various elements of the RAS, the incidence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases remain steadily on the rise. This has lead many investigators to seek novel and innovative approaches, taking advantage of new pathways and technologies, for the control and possibly the cure of hypertension and related pathologies. The main objective of this review is to forward the concept that gene therapy and the genetic targeting of the RAS is the future avenue for the successful control and treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. We will present argument that genetic targeting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a newly discovered member of the RAS, is ideally poised for this purpose. This will be accomplished by discussion of the following: (i) summary of our current understanding of the RAS with a focus on the systemic versus tissue counterparts as they relate to hypertension and other cardiovascular pathologies; (ii) the newly discovered ACE2 enzyme with its physiological and pathophysiological implications; (iii) summary of the current antihypertensive pharmacotherapy and its limitations; (iv) the discovery and design of ACE inhibitors; (v) the emerging concepts for ACE2 drug design; (vi) the current status of genetic targeting of the RAS; (vii) the potential of ACE2 as a therapeutic target for hypertension and cardiovascular disease treatment; and (viii) future perspectives for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "3": "The atherosclerotic models of rabbits fed with high-cholesterol diet were used. There were four groups: high cholesterol group, high cholesterol + captopril group, high cholesterol + valsartan group, normal food group. The intima-media thickness in abdominal aortic were measured by ultrasound. The pathogenic features of the arterial walls were showed by HE stain and observed by light microscope.", 
    "4": "There were less atherosclerotic plaque in high cholesterol + captopril group and high cholesterol + valsartan group than in cholesterol group. The intima-media thickness in high cholesterol + captopril group and in high cholesterol + valsartan group were much more decreased than in high cholesterol group (0.05 +/- 0.005, 0.05 +/- 0.007 vs 0.07 +/- 0.100, P < 0.01). The connection of the endothelial cells were less damaged in high cholesterol + captopril group and high cholesterol + valsartan group than in high cholesterol group.", 
    "5": "Ti is true that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have the effect of preventing or decreasing the formation of atherosclerotic plaque in arterial wall. The findings suggest that ACEI and/or ARB should be first chosen for those with hypertension and with atherosclerotic risk factors or atherosclerotic diseases.", 
    "6": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) may play an important role in cardiorenal disease and it has also been implicated as a cellular receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. The ACE2 active-site model and its crystal structure, which was solved recently, highlighted key differences between ACE2 and its counterpart angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which are responsible for their differing substrate and inhibitor sensitivities. In this study the role of ACE2 active-site residues was explored by site-directed mutagenesis. Arg273 was found to be critical for substrate binding such that its replacement causes enzyme activity to be abolished. Although both His505 and His345 are involved in catalysis, it is His345 and not His505 that acts as the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor in the formation of the tetrahedral peptide intermediate. The difference in chloride sensitivity between ACE2 and ACE was investigated, and the absence of a second chloride-binding site (CL2) in ACE2 confirmed. Thus ACE2 has only one chloride-binding site (CL1) whereas ACE has two sites. This is the first study to address the differences that exist between ACE2 and ACE at the molecular level. The results can be applied to future studies aimed at unravelling the role of ACE2, relative to ACE, in vivo.", 
    "7": "A new method for the in vitro screening of plant extracts with potential angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity is proposed. The method is based on the cleavage of the substrate hippuryl-glycyl-glycine by ACE and subsequent reaction with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to form 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-glycyl-glycine, whose absorbance is determined at 415 nm in a microtitre plate reader. Rabbit lung dehydrated by acetone was employed as an enzyme source. Validation of the method showed satisfactory intra-day (CV = 7.63%) and inter-day precision (CV = 13.61%), recovery (97-102.1%), sensitivity (IC50 = 14.1 nmol/l) and linearity in the range 7.5-120 mmol/l of glycyl-glycine (r2 = 0.9921). Besides, the method showed good correlation with a HPLC assay already established for the screening of ACE inhibitors (r = 0.9935 and 0.9034, respectively, for captopril solutions and for plant extracts). The method involves only inexpensive reagents and apparatus.", 
    "8": "Current understanding of the genesis of diabetic vascular disease suggests that vascular complications, such as atherosclerosis and hypertension, are associated with changes in structural and functional parameters. Experimental and epidemiological data suggest that activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in the development of micro- and macro-vascular complications. Most of the negative cardiovascular actions of angiotensin II are mediated through AT1 receptors, whereas the AT2 receptors mediate largely beneficial effects. Hence, compared to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), selective AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) should provide additional end organ protection via AT2 receptors activation. Although ACEIs are useful therapeutically, they are being currently displaced by ARBs. Enhanced calcium ion channel activity is reported in vascular smooth muscles from diabetic animal models. Clinical benefits of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in diabetic hypertensive patients are controversial, but there is increasing experimental evidence for the beneficial effects of dihydropyridine-type CCBs. Although the treatment of hypertension in diabetics reduces cardiovascular and microvascular complications, the ideal strategy for treating hypertension in diabetics has not been well defined and warrants a combination approach. Only limited clinical data regarding the use of ARBs in combination with CCBs in diabetics are available. The experimental data suggest that combination of a CCB and an AT1 receptor blocker, or a hypothetical dual blocker of AT1 receptors as well as of calcium channels would be an ideal regimen. There is, however, no conclusive clinical evidence to support the combined use of these drugs. This review highlights the available experimental data that support the therapeutic benefits of this combination.", 
    "9": "The relationship between cardiovascular and renal pathologies is well recognized in advanced nephropathy and heart failure, but in early disease it has received less attention. Consequently, microalbuminuria screening and interventions that treat early nephropathy remain under-utilized cardioprotective strategies in the hypertensive patient. Agents that delay the progression of renal disease are likely to be cardioprotective by lessening the systemic consequences of renal dysfunction and may have additional cardioprotective effects by exerting beneficial effects on endothelia elsewhere in the body and within the heart. A critical driving factor within both renal and wider cardiovascular pathologies is overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Accordingly, RAAS-directed antihypertensive agents including both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been demonstrated to have renoprotective effects. In major prospective trials, two ARBs, losartan and irbesartan, have been demonstrated to be renoprotective in patients with frank proteinuria, and one ARB, irbesartan, has been shown to have renoprotective properties in patients with microalbuminuria. For patients with incipient or frank renal dysfunction, an aggressive RAAS-based approach to hypertension management, combining potent blood pressure control with proven renoprotection, may therefore constitute a key component of therapy targeted towards long-term cardioprotection.", 
    "10": "We have shown that treatment of hypertension with ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) enhances relaxation to acetylcholine in human internal thoracic artery (ITA) above this in nonhypertensive patients receiving no ACE-I. Present study assesses the endothelium-dependent responses mediated by neither NO nor prostacyclin in human ITA.", 
    "11": "We compared isolated ITA rings from hypertensive patients treated with ACE-I (ACE-I group) with those from normotensive patients on no ACE-I (control group). Relaxation to acetylcholine was assessed before and after inhibition of NO synthase and cyclooxygenase with L-NMMA and indomethacin, respectively.", 
    "12": "The maximal relaxation in ACE-I group was 79+/-3.3% and was depressed by incubation with L-NMMA and indomethacin to 41+/-2.7% (p<0.001); pD(2)=7.7+/-0.1 vs. 7.4+/-0.8 (p=0.265). The maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was lower in the control group: 65+/-3.3% (p=0.01); pD(2)=7.5+/-0.1 (p=0.07). Incubation with L-NMMA and indomethacin produced contraction to acetylcholine with a maximum of 43+/-7% (p<0.001); pD(2)=5.3+/-0.3 (p<0.001). The area under the concentration-response curve for acetylcholine-induced relaxation in ACE-I group equaled [arbitrary units] 596+/-71 and after incubation with L-NMMA and indomethacin 281+/-40 (p=0.002). Estimated LNMMA- and indomethacin-resistant relaxation, absent in control group, accounted for 47+/-4% of relaxation to acetylcholine in ACE-I group. Estimated NO- and prostacyclin-mediated relaxation was higher in control group than ACE-I group: 628+/-74 vs. 315+/-47 (p=0.009).", 
    "13": "The results suggest that therapy with ACE-I improves endothelial function of hypertensive patients mainly by enhancing the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) (and not NO)-mediated responses.

    "15": "Sixty-eight (26 male) 58.34+/-8.08-year-old patient participated in the study. All were in sinus rhythm and had abnormal blood pressure (163+/-18/95+/-9 mm Hg). Their cardiac mass index was increased (151+/-43 g/m(2) SC) and their left atrial dimension was normal (3.67+/-0.54 cm). The inter-atrial conduction time was measured in the echocardiogram from the beginning of the electrocardiographic P wave to the beginning of the A wave in the mitral Doppler signal and was corrected for heart rate. Heart rhythm disturbances were monitored clinically and by means of a Holter. Most patients were treated with angiotensin antagonists.", 
    "16": "It was found that arterial blood pressure decreased significantly after treatment and that the P-A interval was significantly reduced (71.4+/-14.5 vs. 63.9+/-11.5 ms). During the follow-up, no patient complained of arrhythmia symptoms or exhibited atrial fibrillation in the Holter recording.",

    "18": "African Americans have a higher burden of cardiovascular disease than white Americans, including a higher prevalence of heart failure. In addition, heart failure in African Americans conforms to a more malignant natural history. Hypertension is most often cited as the sole etiology of heart failure in African Americans. Most of the major trials of pharmacotherapy for the management of chronic heart failure have failed to include significant numbers of African-American patients. Based on the available evidence, there is no reason to withhold standard evidence-based medical therapy for heart failure. Even though there is much controversy as to the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers in African Americans, in the absence of definitive data they should be used. Recently, the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine has been demonstrated to improve survival in African Americans with New York Heart Association class III and IV heart failure, and represents an adjunctive treatment option when added to standard medical therapy consisting of ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, digoxin, diuretics, and aldosterone antagonists. Emerging evidence suggests that this therapy may be targeting a novel mechanism of heart failure progression (ie, nitric oxide bioavailability) found in African Americans.", 
    "19": "Cardiovascular disease (especially coronary heart disease ) is the most common complication and cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes. CHD prevention should be the major focus in preventive care of diabetes patients. There is a solid evidence base from which to recommend aggressive control of elevated blood pressure and lipids to reduce CHD events in diabetes. Aggressive glycemic control alone will not reduce CHD events, but will prevent diabetes-specific microvascular complications. Blood pressure should be treated to a goal of at least 130/80 mm Hg, and possibly lower, using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or beta blockers as first-line agents. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be treated with a statin to reduce the level by 30% to 40%, regardless of pretreatment level, to a goal of less than 100 mg/dL for most patients or a goal of less than 70 mg/dL in diabetes patients with CHD. Patients with high-density lipoprotein levels less than 40 mg/dL may benefit from fibrate therapy. Cigarette smoking should be actively discouraged, and prophylactic aspirin therapy should be prescribed for most patients. A regular program of physical activity and weight control should be prescribed to improve insulin sensitivity. Use of thiazolidinediones may be considered early in the course of hypoglycemic therapy, but additional research is needed to define the role of insulin sensitization as a primary means to reduce CHD risk in type 2 diabetes.", 
    "20": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a public health problem of epidemic proportions and its prevalence is on the rise. The typical American born today has a one in three chance of developing type 2 diabetes. This diagnosis is associated with an adverse cardiovascular prognosis and is considered the risk equivalent of established coronary disease. Many risk factors, including the metabolic syndrome, have been implicated in its development. Even in high-risk individuals, type 2 diabetes is a preventable disease. Diet and exercise have been consistently shown to decrease the incidence of diabetes in large randomized controlled studies. Additionally, new-onset diabetes was reduced by several oral pharmacologic anti-diabetic agents including metformin, acarbose and troglitazone in randomized trials which studied patients with impaired glucose tolerance. More interestingly, multiple large prospective studies have also reported a reduction in the development of type 2 diabetes in patients treated with anti-hypertensive agents, predominantly angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. In this review, we will discuss some of these important trials and the speculative mechanisms whereby those medications prevent type 2 diabetes. Such observations, if proven to be true, may represent preventive strategies which can be considered in patients with pre-diabetic conditions such as the metabolic syndrome, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, family history of diabetes, obesity, congestive heart failure or other risks for the development of type 2 diabetes.",

The cohorts used were 1000 subjects on ramipril, and 1000 subjects on placebo enrolled in the HOPE trial. Kaplan-Meier curves at 5 years of the clinical study were fitted using an exponential model over a lifetime horizon, the outcome variables being myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization and death. Total direct medical costs have been considered from a third-party payer's perspective--the Italian National Health Service. Resources involved in each event/activity were estimated using the modified Delphi technique with a panel of six clinicians. Types of resources reported included drug therapies, laboratory and imaging tests, physician visits, outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation, as well as medical and surgical hospital admissions. The incremental cost per life year gained was the main measure of the analysis.",

After the first year the ICER is 55,062 euros and subsequently decreases to about 12,770 euros at 5 years, 5945 euros at 10 years and 3726 euros at 20 years. The two ways sensitivity analysis showed that at 5 years ICERs range from a saving of 4059 euros to a cost of 22,929 euros (at 20 years they are 1814 euros and 4434 euros), mainly depending on the cost of drug and cost of events.

Treatment thresholds and targets should take into account each individual's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and any comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be lowered to 140/90 mmHg or less in all patients, and to 130/80 mmHg or less in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most adults with hypertension require more than one agent to achieve target blood pressures. For adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic hypertension with or without systolic hypertension include beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (except in black patients), long-acting calcium channel blockers and angiotensin receptor antagonists. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and angiotensin receptor antagonists. Certain comorbid conditions provide compelling indications for first-line use of other agents: in patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists (or thiazides in patients with diabetes mellitus without albuminuria) are appropriate first-line therapies; and in patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors are recommended. All hypertensive patients should have their fasting lipids screened, and those with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents recommended by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program Working Group on the management of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Selected patients with hypertension, but without dyslipidemia, should also receive statin therapy and/or acetylsalicylic acid therapy.",

Since angiotensin (ANG) II availability is decreased by ACE inhibition but is increased by NEP inhibition, we evaluated the influence of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat on ANG II-dependent noradrenaline (NA) release.", 
    "35": "The functional relevance of ACE-dependent and NEP-dependent generation and degradation of ANG II on NA overflow was determined in pithed rats by applications of ANG I (0.1-100 microg/kg) or ANG II (0.01-10 microg/kg) after single injections of ramipril (1 mg/kg), the NEP inhibitor candoxatril (100 mg/kg), or the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (30 mg/kg).", 
    "36": "Blood pressure was equipotently decreased by ramipril and omapatrilat, but not by candoxatril. NA overflow was increased after ANG I infusions in controls (EC50 = 9.0 microg/kgANG I, Emax = 5680 pg/ml), but almost completely suppressed by ramipril and omapatrilat. Candoxatril decreased EC50 (4.1 microg/kg) and increased Emax (7259 pg/ml). NA overflow after ANG II infusions was enhanced by candoxatril or omapatrilat. Ex vivo ACE activity was extensively inhibited by ramipril or omapatrilat, whereas ex vivo NEP activity was reduced by omapatrilat and candoxatril only. In vitro, omapatrilat inhibited NEP and ACE with similar potencies (IC50 NEP/IC50 ACE = 0.4).", 
    "37": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors influence ANG II-related NA release depending on their ability to modulate the availability of ANG II via ACE or NEP. After acute application, the vasopeptidase inhibitor suppresses NA release in response to ANG I due to a predominant reduction of ANG II formation. These results indicate that the ratio of ACE-inhibitory and NEP-inhibitory potencies of vasopeptidase inhibitors may be relevant for sympathetic activation in chronic therapy.", 
    "38": "Arterial pressure fluctuates rhythmically in healthy supine resting humans, who, from all outward appearances, are in a 'steady-state'. Others have asked, If baroreflex mechanisms are functioning normally, how can arterial pressure be so variable? We reanalysed data from nine healthy young adult men and women and tested the hypotheses that during brief periods of observation, human baroreflex sensitivity fluctuates widely and rhythmically. We estimated vagal baroreflex sensitivity with systolic pressure and R-R interval cross-spectra measured over 15 s segments, moved by 2 s steps through 20-min periods of frequency- and tidal volume-controlled breathing. We studied each subject at the same time on three separate days, with fixed protocols that included two physiological states, supine and passive 40 deg upright tilt, before and after beta-adrenergic, cholinergic, and angiotensin converting enzyme blockade. Minimum, mean and maximum (+/-s.d.) supine control baroreflex sensitivities averaged 5 +/- 3, 18 +/- 6, and 55 +/- 22 ms mmHg(-1). In most subjects, moderate ongoing fluctuations of baroreflex sensitivity were punctuated by brief major peaks, yielding frequency distributions that were skewed positively. Fast Fourier transforms indicated that baroreflex sensitivity fluctuations (expressed as percentages of total power) concentrated more in very low, 0.003-0.04 Hz, than ultra low, 0.0-0.003 Hz, frequencies (77 +/- 7 versus 11 +/- 8%, P < or = 0.001, rank sum test). Autoregressive centre frequencies averaged 0.012 +/- 0.003 Hz. The periodicity of very low frequency baroreflex sensitivity fluctuations was not influenced significantly by upright tilt, or by variations of autonomic drive or angiotensin activity. Our analysis indicates that during ostensibly 'steady-state' conditions, human vagal baroreflex sensitivity fluctuates in a major way, at very low frequencies.", 
    "39": "It is highly controversial to define the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphisms in essential hypertension. We studied a group of patients in whom hypertension was the major side effect of treatment by cyclosporine A (CsA). This study group comprised 227 Italian patients with nephrotic syndrome, 103 of which were treated with CsA and had different outcome. Forty-nine patients developed serious hypertension that was reversed after withdrawal of drug. ACE haplotypes were determined by a combination of molecular and statistical methods after verifying genotypes of six intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms in 304 Italian blood donors and assembling them in clades (A, B, C) that include 95% of observed haplotypes. The association between ACE clade combinations and serum enzymatic levels confirmed the previous results about a role of an unidentified genetic variant at the 5' of the intragenic recombination site located near intron 7. ACE clades were then determined in patients, and regression methods were used to analyze variables associated with CsA responsivity and progression to renal failure. ACE genotype and responsiveness to CsA were strictly associated, because homozygosis for ACE B clade was able to influence CsA sensitivity. This highlights the role of 5' variants, which differentiate clades B and C. Other genetic markers were tested to search for possible additive effects. We found that PAI-1 4G allele was associated with progression to renal failure in the group of CsA-treated patients. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis, raised after experimental results obtained in mouse models, that the effect of ACE polymorphisms on blood pressure is detectable once environmental factors, like CsA treatment in our case, overcome physiological homeostatic mechanisms.", 
    "40": "Sudden death in patients with heart failure (HF) is a topic of great complexity. Neurohumoral activation including adrenergic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been a suspected trigger for lethal ventricular arrhythmias and sudden deaths. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and beta-adrenergic blockers improve survivals in patients with HF. Although prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is effective reducing mortality in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, the ICD is unlikely to be appropriate for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction. In addition, the effect of routine prophylactic use of ICDs on health care costs must be carefully considered. The care of patients with LV systolic dysfunction should be individualized for each patient.", 
    "41": "Organic anion transporters (OATs), which are expressed in proximal tubule cells, mediate diuretic secretion into tubular fluid. Increased plasma levels of organic anions and urate and metabolic acidosis, i.e. two characteristic features of chronic renal insufficiency, could be factors contributing to diuretic resistance. These limitations demand increasing doses of diuretics up to a maximum level, or the use of a loop diuretic with non-renal metabolism. Diuretic responsiveness in nephrotic syndrome is limited by strong Na+ reabsorption in the distal nephron. Strategies to improve loop diuretic responsiveness include diuretic dosage and the combination of a loop diuretic with a distal acting diuretic. Strategies to limit protein excretion include the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and appropriate salt intake limitation.", 
    "42": "Coronary heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality in the United States, with 84 percent of persons 65 years or older dying from this disease. Secondary preventive measures, including lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy, are important for elderly patients because of the variable impacts on morbidity and mortality rates and quality of life. Participating in light to moderate activities significantly decreases mortality rates in elderly patients. Smoking cessation translates into a reduction in overall mortality and morbidity rates at least equal to that of other preventive measures such as aspirin or beta-blocker therapy. Recent studies on the effects of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to below 100 mg per dL have shown a substantial reduction in coronary heart disease mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction rates, with a persistent effect in patients older than 75 years. Hypertension, manifesting mostly as isolated systolic blood pressure elevation, also should be treated aggressively. Conventional medical therapies for hypertension (e.g., diuretics, beta blockers) and newer agents (e.g., calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), together with sodium restriction, have had a positive effect on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity rates in older patients. With the increasing prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, interventions targeting weight reduction and glucose control should be emphasized. Whereas weight-loss strategies are poorly defined in this population, the management of diabetes through dietary modification, exercise, and medications is similar across age groups. The target hemoglobin A1C level is less than 7 percent. Elderly patients are prone to depression and social isolation, and they are more likely to have a lower socioeconomic status than younger patients, which may negatively affect participation in rehabilitation programs and compliance with medical advice and therapy. Strategies aimed at these factors have shown variable results and remain ill-defined.", 
    "43": "Disease management programs (DMP) have been recently introduced in the German statutory healthcare sector by federal law. These compulsory programs are aimed at enhancing guideline-based treatment by primary care physicians. Based on a systematic analysis of disease models and deficits in healthcare delivery, patient-oriented DMP offer an alternative approach. Their standardized services include care calls, written educational material, reminder systems, health reports, and optional telemetric monitoring. As an example of this approach, the medical results of 151 patients participating in a comprehensive chronic heart failure (CHF) program were evaluated. Within the observation period of 12 months, the number of patients receiving appropriate prescriptions (ACE inhibitors, diuretics, or beta blockers) rose significantly. In many patients there was a remission of CHF key symptoms (leg edema, shortness of breath, dizziness). The daily weight monitoring was particularly appreciated by the patients. For further development of patient-oriented DMP in the German healthcare system, it will be crucial that financial savings can be convincingly demonstrated besides the clinical benefits. These include quality of life, particularly for those chronic conditions in which patient self-management has a large impact on disease course.", 
    "44": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries where it predominantly affects elderly persons with a range of other comorbid conditions requiring polypharmacy. In Australia, over 300 000 people are affected by CHF. Quality general practice forms the cornerstone for early diagnosis and evidence based integrated care.", 
    "45": "This article examines the epidemiology of CHF, its clinical diagnosis, contemporary management and future treatment possibilities, as well as current barriers to optimal care.", 
    "46": "The global prevalence of CHF is rising. Optimal treatment requires a coordinated interdisciplinary approach using a biopsychosocial model of care in order to maximise compliance with therapy. Pharmacological treatment is essential and should include an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and beta blocker where possible. Device based treatment and cardiac surgery may benefit selected cases.", 
    "47": "The ability of Zofenoprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor carrying a thiol group, to intervene in protein S-thiolation processes was tested on bovine lens aldose reductase (ALR2). Zofenoprilat, more susceptible to oxidation than glutathione (GSH), forms with this physiological thiol a rather stable mixed disulfide (ZSSG). ZSSG, whose generation through the transthiolation reaction between GSH and Zofenoprilat homodisulfide was shown to be enhanced by a micro-class glutathione S-transferase, appears to be a specific donor of the Zofenoprilat moiety in the S-thiolation processes. This is indicated by the apparent stability of ZSSG to reduction by GSH and by the specificity of the transfer of the group on ALR2, used as a protein model. Indeed, the S-thiolation of ALR2 by ZSSG occurred exclusively through the insertion of the Zofenoprilat moiety of ZSSG on the enzyme. The modified ALR2 is shown to retain the same activity of the native enzyme, but displays a reduced sensitivity to inhibition. The S-thiolation of specific target enzymes is proposed as an event potentially relevant for the antioxidant action of Zofenoprilat.", 
    "48": "beta-Glucan extracted from oats was subjected to reductive amination, producing a cationic beta-glucan derivative of which physiological properties were characterized. The degree of substitution was obtained from elemental analysis, which was 0.48. In addition, the distribution of amino groups in the beta-glucan derivative was investigated by FT-IR analysis. In vitro bile acid binding capacity of the aminated beta-glucan was examined, showing significantly higher bile acid binding activity than native beta-glucan. Moreover, the beta-glucan derivative showed pronounced antimicrobial effects against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibition activities which were dependent on its concentration. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) experiments demonstrated that the beta-glucan derivative stimulated the synthesis of nitric oxide. The improved functionalities of the derivative could be explained by its polycationic characteristics.", 
    "49": "It has been proved that effectiveness of monotherapy in mild hypertension is about 50%; in the other half of patients the dose of previously used drug should be increased or combined therapy should be recommended. THE AIM OF THE STUDY was to compare treatment with angiotensin convertase enzyme inhibitor--ACE-I (enalapril 10 mg bid--group 1) to therapy with ACE-I combined with calcium antagonist (enalapril 5 mg bid + nitrendipine 20 mg qd--group 2).", 
    "50": "In a prospective, open, randomised crossover study we assessed 44 hypertensive subjects (17 women, 27 men), aged 35-69 years (mean age 48.6 years) with poorly controlled hypertension treated with enalapril 5 mg twice daily. Mean initial systolic blood pressure was 150.8 < or = 9.9 mmHg, diastolic 94.7 +/- 5.3 mmHg respectively. The influence of the treatment regimen on the quality of life (QoL) was estimated by a questionnaire.", 
    "51": "The effectiveness of both used procedures did not differ statistically--in both groups mean blood pressure reduction was similar (14/8 mmHg in 4 weeks), also percentage of patients with well controlled hypertension (about 50%) did not differ significantly. In the group with changes regimen from monotherapy to combined therapy the improvement of systolic blood pressure was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05); in the case of combined therapy replaced with monotherapy such an improvement was not observed. In the subgroup with the isolated systolic hypertension combined therapy was considerably more effective. The improvement of QoL was noted in both groups, mainly in the initial phase of the study.", 
    "52": "In mild hypertension ACE-I and calcium antagonist combination is effective in blood pressure reduction and in the improvement of the quality of life. Nitrendipine in a dose 20 mg in an once daily regimen is a potent and safe hypotensive agent, particularly in isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "53": "A 10-year-old cat with the paresis of hind limbs was initially diagnosed as a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy followed by acute thromboembolism of caudal abdominal aorta from the findings of the medical examinations. However, this case was proved to be an chronic myocardial infarction due to arteriosclerosis of coronary arteries by the pathologic diagnosis. In the left ventricular, the hypertrophy and the narrowing were slight, and a coagulative infarction was seen obviously. The intramural coronary arteriosclerosis showed thickening of the wall due to medial hyperplasia by fibrosis, and arterial stenosis. Myocardial infarction and arteriosclerosis are scarcely any reports of these lesions in cats. This case is valuable for an extremely rare case of myocardial infarction in the cat.", 
    "54": "Osteopontin has been reported to have an important role in cardiac fibrosis. However, little is known about the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) on osteopontin expression in infarcted myocardium. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of an ACEI (perindpril) and an ARB (candesartan cilexitil) on cardiac function as assessed by Doppler echocardiography and cardiac osteopontin expression associated with cardiac remodeling in myocardial infarcted rats. ACEI or ARB was administered after myocardial infarction (MI). At 4 weeks after MI, cardiac function, and mRNAs in non-infarcted myocardium were analyzed. ACEI and ARB equally prevented left ventricular dilatation, reduction of ejection fraction, and the increase in E/A wave velocity ratio and the rate of E wave deceleration by MI. ACEI and ARB significantly suppressed increased mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, osteopontin, and collagen I and III in the non-infarcted ventricle at 4 weeks. Immunohistochemically stained osteopontin was increased in interstitial fibrosis of non-infarcted myocardium. Both ACEI and ARB significantly prevented cardiac fibrosis and osteopontin expression. In conclusion, angiotensin blockade inhibits osteopontin expression in non-infarcted myocardium and prevents cardiac remodeling after MI.", 
    "55": "Differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and physiology contribute to the phenomenon that women and men frequently respond differently to cardiovascular drugs. Hormonal influences, in addition, can play an important role: for example, the menstrual cycle, menopause, and pregnancy--as a result of fluctuations in concentrations of sexual steroids, and of changes in total body water--can be associated with gender-specific differences in the plasma levels of cardiovascular drugs. Clinical relevance accordingly results, especially for substances with a narrow therapeutic margin. This review treats the most important pharmacodynamic gender-relevant differences in this context, and surveys available evidence on the benefits of therapy of chronic cardiovascular diseases in women. On the whole, the study situation for women is appreciably less favourable than for men: owing to the fact that women are under-represented in most studies, and that few gender-specific analyses have been conducted.", 
    "56": "This retrospective review assesses the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa for treating anemia after renal transplantation. Patients were evaluated over a 12-week period, and efficacy was based on achieving hemoglobin >12 g/dL. Thirty-six patients were analyzed (53% male, 53% cadaveric allografts, median age 42.5 years). Baseline creatinine clearance ranged from approximately 15 to >100 mL/min. Most patients initiated darbepoetin alfa <3 months (50%) or >12 months (44%) after transplantation, 19% were previously receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), and 47% were on concomitant ACE inhibitors. The majority of patients received either tacrolimus- (53%) or cyclosporine- (44%) based immunosuppression. Overall, 29 (81%) patients achieved the hemoglobin target with a mean time to response of 4.4 weeks. Neither the time to anemia onset, previous rHuEPO therapy, concomitant ACE inhibitor, allograft source, immunosuppressive regimen, nor degree of renal function affected the proportion of patients achieving the hemoglobin target, time to response or darbepoetin alfa dose requirement. Patients with anemia >12 months post-transplantation or on concomitant ACE inhibitors required a significantly longer duration of therapy. No adverse events associated with darbepoetin alfa therapy were detected. These results demonstrate that darbepoetin alfa is a safe and effective treatment for anemia in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "57": "Modification of cardiovascular risk factors can reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), effectively extend survival, decrease the need for interventional procedures, and improve quality of life in persons with known cardiovascular disease. Pharmacological treatments and important lifestyle changes reduce people's risks substantially (by 1/3 to 2/3) and can slow and perhaps reverse progression of established coronary disease. When used appropriately, these interventions are more cost-effective than many other treatments, currently provided by the National Health Service [Department of Health National Service Frameworks: coronary heart disease. Preventing coronary heart disease in high risk patients. 2000. HMSO.] Secondary prevention clinics are effective means by which to ensure targets are achieved and assist primary care in long-term maintenance of lifestyle change and drug optimisation. A 2-year hospital-based pilot project was established at the Royal Hospitals, April 2001-April 2003. The aim of the project was to target patients with coronary heart disease, post-MI and/or coronary artery bypass grafting and/or percutaneous coronary intervention, 6 months following their cardiac event. The plan was to assess patient risk factors and medication a minimum of 6 months following their cardiac event to ascertain if government targets were being achieved; secondly, to examine the effectiveness of a hospital-based nurse-led secondary prevention clinic on modifying risk factors and optimising drug therapies.",

    "59": "For proof of principle, the protein activity of human MMP-2 and MMP-9 produced by the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line was detected using gelatin zymography. Gene expression was determined by real time reverse transcriptase PCR and tumour cell invasion using Matrigel invasion chambers. The effect of captopril on the in vivo growth of MGLVA-1 human gastric adenocarcinoma xenografts was evaluated in a nude mouse model.", 
    "60": "Captopril inhibited activity of secreted MMP-9 and MMP-2, however, gene expression in HT1080 remained unaltered. Invasion of HT1080 cells was inhibited by 48% (p<0.001). Tumour size was reduced by 40-50% with 0.4 mg/ml captopril (p<0.01) and when combined with cisplatin the inhibition increased to 71% (p<0.05).", 
    "61": "ACE inhibitors inhibit the activity of secreted MMP-2 and -9 by a mechanism similar to synthetic MMP inhibitors. ACE inhibitors have previously been shown to inhibit tumour growth, however; this is the first study to demonstrate inhibition of a human gastric xenograft, both alone and in combination with cisplatin. These results support further investigation into the anticancer effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "62": "Plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) is not increased significantly in renovascular hypertension (RVH), but tissue ANG II levels are elevated in both kidneys of renovascular rats. Because the contralateral, non-ischemic kidney is critical for maintenance of hypertension in RVH, this study sought to understand the mechanism by which intrarenal ANG II levels are augmented in the non-ischemic kidney. This study tested the hypothesis that an incremental increase in plasma ANG II induces the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the non-ischemic kidney by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) dependent mechanism.", 
    "63": "To simulate the incremental increase in plasma ANG II induced by the ischemic kidney in RVH, an ANG II infusion model was used. This model used a chronic infusion of ANG II (40 ng/min) or vehicle by osmotic minipump into uninephrectomized rats. Parallel groups were treated with the ACE inhibitor Enalaprilat (200 mg/kg/day). Intrarenal ACE activity was measured by radioenzymatic assay. ANG II levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay.", 
    "64": "Hypertension was evident in ANG II-infused rats, compared to control rats (155 +/- 4 versus 112 +/- 1 mmHg; P < 0.001). Concurrent treatment with Enalaprilat reversed the hypertension induced by ANG II infusion (98 +/- 3 versus 155 +/- 4 mmHg; P < 0.001). ANG II up-regulated intrarenal ACE activity in the non-ischemic kidney (59.2 +/- 11.9 versus 25.2 +/- 6.8 units/mg protein; P < 0.01). Enalaprilat significantly decreased renal ACE activity in ANG II-treated rats, compared to ANG II alone (11.4 +/- 1.0 versus 59.2 +/- 11.9 units/mg protein; P < 0.001). Intrarenal ANG II was increased in ANG II-infused rats, compared to control animals (52.9 +/- 7.1 versus 23.0 +/- 3.2 fmol/mg tissue; P < 0.001), and Enalaprilat prevented ANG II-induced increases in intrarenal ANG II (29.9 +/- 2.6 versus 52.9 +/- 7.1 fmol/mg tissue; P < 0.05).", 
    "65": "Incremental changes in plasma ANG II induce de novo production of ANG II in the non-ischemic kidney to augment intrarenal ANG II content. ACE inhibition blocks this positive feedback loop, suggesting that ANG II activates the intrarenal RAS by an ACE-dependent mechanism. The impact of ACE inhibition on blood pressure suggests that this feedback loop may be an important mechanism for maintenance of hypertension in RVH.", 
    "66": "Myocardial infarction causes neurohormonal activation involving aldosterone and angiotensin II (AngII). These hormones may increase arterial stiffness, an independent cardiovascular risk factor contributing to progression of congestive heart failure (CHF). This study aimed to determine the effect of aldosterone and AngII blockade on carotid artery distensibility and collagen density in adult Wistar rats with MI-induced CHF. Five groups were studied: Sham-operated, CHF, CHF + spironolactone, CHF + lisinopril, CHF + Spironolactone + Lisinopril. After echocardiography, in vitro isobaric carotid distensibility (echo-tracking technique) and collagen density were measured, and the incremental elastic modulus (Einc) calculated. In the CHF group, intra-ventricular pressure and cardiac weight were increased; carotid distensibility was reduced (CHF: 0.42 +/- 0.30 per mmHg(3) versus sham: 1.75 +/- 0.50 per mmHg(3); P < 0.001), and collagen content increased by 87% when compared to sham. All treatments reduced intra-ventricular pressure, carotid distensibility and fibrosis when compared to CHF but did not change cardiac weight. However, carotid distensibility and intra-ventricular pressure were not completely restored towards sham values and were significantly and inversely related. Spironolactone, which did not decrease significantly blood pressure, was the only drug reducing Einc independently of wall stress (WS). Thus, MI-induced CHF was associated with carotid artery remodeling. This vascular change, which may contribute to maintain cardiac hypertrophy and CHF, is largely prevented by AngII and aldosterone blockade. Only spironolactone reduced the stiffness of carotid wall material independently of blood pressure and WS.",

    "74": "The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a major player in maintaining cardiac function, as it is intimately involved in the regulation of Ca2+-movements on a beat-to-beat basis. SR dysfunction due to abnormalities in SR protein content has been reported in different cardiac diseases such as ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and various cardiomyopathies; thus the genes expressing the SR Ca2+-pump, Ca2+-channels, calsequestrin, phospholamban and other regulatory proteins are considered important targets for drug development. In our experience, ischaemic preconditioning (IP) and pharmacological therapies, such as anti-oxidants, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor (AT-1) blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers are effective therapies that improve cardiac performance in the failing heart by improving SR function. Accordingly, this paper is intended to shed light on the knowledge in the field of cardiac therapy targeted to improve and protect SR function.", 
    "75": "Despite the introduction of new antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel antagonists, the blood pressure of fewer than 30% of hypertensive patients is controlled with current therapies; compliance and continuation with medication are poor. The renin-angiotensin system is important in the pathophysiology of hypertension, end-organ damage and congestive cardiac failure. Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist that provides dose-dependent, specific, insurmountable blockade of the AT1 receptor both in vivo and in vitro. It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, has a bioavailability of 60-80% with no food effect, does not require metabolism to a bioactive compound, and is excreted by both biliary and renal routes so that dosage adjustments are unnecessary in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Irbesartan produces dose-dependent blood pressure reductions, with 24 h activity confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Irbesartan is effective in the elderly and non-elderly, men and women and in cases of mild and severe hypertension. The recommended starting dosage is 150 mg once daily (o.d.), which can be increased to 300 mg. Its antihypertensive effect is accentuated by diuretic co-administration. In controlled clinical trials, irbesartan was at least as effective as atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine and enalapril. In a double-blind study, irbesartan 300 mg was more effective than losartan 100 mg, and in a dose-titration study, irbesartan 150-300 mg produced significantly greater blood pressure reductions than losartan 50-100 mg. In pooled data from nine placebo-controlled studies, adverse event and discontinuation rates for irbesartan were similar to those for placebo, and there was no relationship between dose and adverse effects. Preliminary clinical data suggest positive haemodynamic effects in heart failure and renoprotective effects in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "76": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a prominent feature of left ventricular dysfunction and plays an important role in the progression of chronic heart failure. Clinical and animal studies investigating agents that interrupt this hormonal system have focused primarily on the proximal constituents of the RAAS, namely angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and have largely neglected the possible pathological consequences of another hormone in the system, aldosterone. Clinical evidence indicates that aldosterone plays an important role in chronic heart failure, even when other RAAS inhibiting agents are employed. Moreover, animal studies have indicated that aldosterone, in addition to important renal effects, has direct cardiac and vascular effects. These data suggest that an anti-aldosterone therapeutic may provide important protection in chronic heart failure. Currently, only one therapeutic is available, spironolactone (Aldactone), and recent clinical studies support the contention that the addition of spironolactone to standard heart failure therapy provides additional benefit. A highly selective aldosterone receptor antagonist, eplerenone, is currently in clinical development. Data from this new agent should provide important evidence supporting the benefit of anti-aldosterone therapy in chronic heart failure, which may encourage physicians to include an anti-aldosterone agent in the armamentarium of therapeutics currently used to combat chronic heart failure.", 
    "77": "The non-peptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists are a new class of compounds that are continuing to be developed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure (HF) and chronic renal disease (CRD). Several of these compounds are currently available for therapeutic use in the USA and the European community with several more in clinical trials and in development. Compounds in this new class are as effective as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in treating hypertensive patients and appeared to have a similar therapeutic profile to ACE inhibitors in patients with HF and CRD. One clinical advantage of the AII receptor antagonists over ACE inhibitors is an improved side-effect profile with the absence of the persistent dry cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. To date, it is clear that the AII receptor antagonists are effective antihypertensive agents. Clinical trials are currently in progress to determine the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of HF and progressive renal disease.", 
    "78": "Valsartan is the second orally-active, non-peptide angiotensin II receptor blocker to reach the market in Europe and the USA for the treatment of hypertension. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that this blocker is specific for the AT(1) receptor and has no affinity for the angiotensin II AT(2) receptor. Experimentally, valsartan dose-dependently inhibits the vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II and lowers blood pressure in renin-dependent models of hypertension. Pharmacologically, oral valsartan is characterised by a low bioavailability but a rapid absorption and distribution with a half-life in keeping with once-daily administration. Thus, after oral administration, the maximal plasma concentration is reached 2 h after dosing and the elimination half-life is about 6 h. Clinically, several dose-finding and comparative studies have demonstrated that valsartan is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Valsartan has also been shown to be effective in severe hypertension. Valsartan is at least as effective as ACE inhibitors, diuretics, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. However, none of the side-effects observed with these latter agents, including cough and lower limb oedema, has been observed with the administration of valsartan. Three large clinical trials are now underway to demonstrate whether valsartan can reduce morbidity and mortality: one in hypertensives with a high cardiovascular risk profile (VALUE), one in patients with heart failure previously treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (VAL-HeFT) and one in post-myocardial infarct patients (VALIANT). These studies will further define the place of valsartan beyond the treatment of hypertension.",

The intensity of care and outcomes of these patients were prospectively tracked for more than 90 days. During this time, there were 325 patient contacts (median 8.5 per patient), including 247 calls (median 7 per patient) and 78 clinic visits (median 2 per patient). Brigham and Women's Hospital clinicians adjusted diuretics a total of 109 times (median 2.5 times per patient). When frequency of diuretic adjustments was used to estimate the intensity of care, higher values of blood urea nitrogen at discharge predicted an increased intensity of care during the 90-day follow-up (relative risk [RR] 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.3, P = .02). When frequency of clinic visits, telephone calls, and diuretic adjustments were used to estimate intensity of care, discharge creatinine (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.06, P = .05), discharge blood urea nitrogen (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.23, P = .004), and length of stay (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.13, P = .04) were predictors of the composite end point.",

    "87": "The management of the high-risk patient with hypertension has become more challenging in recent years. Drug therapy should be initiated earlier and at lower blood pressure levels in patients with coexisting cardiovascular or kidney diseases. The blood pressure goals of drug therapy are substantially lower when patients have concomitant heart or kidney disease or diabetes mellitus. Numerous clinical trials in tens of thousands of hypertensive patients with increased cardiovascular risk have demonstrated that the calcium antagonists are as effective and safe as diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, and renin-angiotensin blocking agents to prevent heart attack and stroke but not heart failure. Several recent studies also demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers are effective in preventing stroke, progressive renal insufficiency, and heart failure in higher risk patients with hypertension. To achieve the aggressive blood pressure goals in patients with cardiovascular disease, thoughtful combinations of additive or synergistic agents improve efficacy and tolerability and have become an integral part of the modern management of hypertensive patients with coexisting cardiovascular disease.", 
    "88": "Glomerular diseases, including diabetes and various forms of glomerulonephritis, account for more than 70% of patients undergoing renal transplantation. Among these patients, more than 40% develop significant proteinuria, and around 15% develop persistent nephrotic syndrome. The most common cause of posttransplantation proteinuria is chronic allograft nephropathy (60%), followed by recurrent (15%) and de novo (10%) glomerulonephritis. Persistent proteinuria is associated with a significantly reduced rate of graft survival but often can be controlled with non-disease-specific therapy including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers with favorable effects on long-term prognosis. Recurrent or de novo glomerulonephritis occurs in 6%-20% of patients overall and is more common in patients transplanted with glomerulonephritic organs. Glomerulonephritis in the allograft is also associated with a reduction in long-term (5-year) graft survival (40% vs 70%). The most common diseases associated with allograft glomerulonephritis and their recurrence rates in transplantation patients are idiopathic focal glomerular sclerosis (20%-30%), IgA nephropathy (25%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (type 1, 25%; type 2, 80%), membranous nephropathy (30%), and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (classic, 10%; atypical, 40%; familial, 60%). This article reviews new developments in the understanding of 3 of these diseases-focal glomerular sclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome-as they relate to the incidence of recurrence, the effects of recurrence on graft survival, risk factors for recurrence, and management issues for nephrologists caring for patients with renal allografts. Proper donor selection, early diagnosis in high-risk patients, and appropriate management can prolong graft survival and improve long-term outcomes.", 
    "89": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have proved effective in preventing or ameliorating clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure. Experimental evidence demonstrates their anti-atherogenic potential; ACE inhibitors do not only suppress the formation of proatherogenic angiotensin II (AII), but also enhance the formation and release of anti-atherogenic nitric oxide (NO) at local tissue sites; both mechanisms are implicated in the suppression of neointima formation in the balloon-injured vessel wall. A similar anti-atherogenic potential is provided by the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) at the level of the angiotensin type-1 (AT1) receptor. AT1 receptor antagonists do not only block the proatherogenic actions of AII, but also induce an enhanced formation and release of anti-atherogenic NO at local tissue sites. AT1 receptor antagonists may therefore prove as effective as ACE inhibitors in patients with manifest atherosclerosis.",

    "91": "A blind randomized trial in parallel groups recruited 40 patients (20 patients each). The patients received 1 tablet a day noliprel (2 mg/0.625 mg) or caposide (50 mg/25 mg) for 6 months. Target pressure patients were counted. Speed of the pulse wave, blood lipids and electrolytes, left ventricular myocardium posterior wall thickness were estimated.", 
    "92": "By antihypertensive efficacy and ability to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy and to improve arterial elasticity, low-dose fixed combination (noliprel) was not inferior to caposide (high-dose fixed combination) while by T/P noliprel was more effective than caposide, it lowered cholesterol more but potassium level--less.",

    "94": "The present report describes how the soluble germinal angiotensin I-converting enzyme (gACE) appears in the epididymal fluid, where it has been identified in some laboratory rodents and domestic ungulates. We showed that this gACE results from an active proteolytic process that releases the enzyme's extracellular domain from sperm in a precise spatiotemporal location during epididymal transit and that this process involves serine protease activity. Using polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal intracellular sequence of ACE, a fragment of approximately 10 kDa was detected on the sperm extract only in the epididymal region, where the gACE release occurs. The fluid enzyme was purified, and the cleavage site was determined by mass spectrometry to be between Arg622 and Leu623 of the mature sheep gACE sequence (equivalent to Arg627 and Arg1203 of the human mature gACE and somatic ACE sequences, respectively). Thereafter, the C-terminal Arg was removed, leaving Ala621 as a C-terminal. Using an in vitro assay, gACE cleavage from sperm was strongly increased by the presence of epididymal fluid from the release zone, and this increase was inhibited specifically by the serine protease-inhibitor AEBSF but not by para-aminobenzamidine. None of the other inhibitors tested, such as metallo- or cystein-protease inhibitors, had a similar effect on release. It was also found that this process did not involve changes in gACE phosphorylation.", 
    "95": "Heart failure (HF) complicating acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterized by varying degrees of pulmonary congestion, and in its severest form, by profound organ hypoperfusion (cardiogenic shock). The occurrence of HF in patients with ACS has long been recognized as a strong predictor of increased morbidity and mortality. As such, there is increased interest in better understanding the epidemiology and management of this common clinical syndrome. This manuscript reviews recent insights from work in this area, including recent important trials evaluating the impact of renin-angiotensin system inhibition, early beta-blockade, and aggressive reperfusion strategies.", 
    "96": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Numerous placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that treatment of hypertension results in substantial reduction of hypertension-related vascular events. The benefit of specific therapies beyond their effect on blood pressure is well established. Losartan is an orally-active, selective, nonpeptide, angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonist (ARB), and it was the first in this class to be marketed. Several large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that losartan and other ARBs have benefits in preventing cardiovascular disease. The Losartan Intervention For End point reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study demonstrated improved outcomes with losartan as compared with atenolol-based therapies in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, mainly because of stroke prevention. The Reduction of End points in Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study demonstrated that losartan prevented the progression of diabetic nephropathy. In this review, evidence from these and other clinical trials with losartan shall be discussed. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of losartan are described to explain its mechanisms of action. Among the ARB class, losartan possesses certain unique properties, which may enhance its cardiovascular protective effects. These include an increase of urinary uric acid excretion and antiatherothrombotic properties. Potential future roles for losartan and other ARBs shall be discussed, in addition to emphasizing areas in which evidence is currently lacking or indecisive, including head-to-head comparisons of ARBs and the effects of combining an ARB with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "97": "Not uncommonly the effective treatment of hypertension requires multi-drug therapy. Multi-drug combinations that dominate clinical practice typically include a thiazide-type diuretic together with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or an angiotensin-receptor blocker, or a beta-blocker. On the other hand, there are several medication choices that provide incremental blood pressure reduction but all too often go under-appreciated as to their effectiveness. Such drug combinations include within class switching of diuretics, combining a thiazide-type diuretic with a calcium-channel blocker, utilizing 2 calcium-channel blockers from different classes, giving an ACE inhibitor together with an angiotensin-receptor blocker, adding an aldosterone receptor antagonist to any of several other drug classes, as well as adding nitrate therapy to any of several other drug classes. Such novel pharmacologic approaches offer useful options for treatment in the otherwise difficult to control hypertensive patient.",

Vasodilation to the higher dose of SNP was 791+/-79% in CONT, 633+/-72% in EHT and 355+/-69% in DHT (NS, P<0.001 compared with controls, respectively). The average peak flow during PORH was significantly lower in both the EHT and DHT groups compared with controls (294+/-39, 267+/-59 and 429+/-45%, respectively, P<0.05).

Blood pressure on treatment was 144+/-21/82+/-11 mmHg. Among patients on antihypertensive drug therapy, 34% reported adverse effects: dizziness (9%), ankle swelling (7%), headache (5%), fatigue (4%), chest discomfort (3%) and cough (3%). Fewer patients on BBs reported side-effects (OR 0.46, P=0.008).

Secondly, enalaprilat concentrations at 12-24 h following a single oral dose of enalapril in healthy volunteers were lower than those reported in the literature. The values reported here correlated with the return of blood pressure to predose level. Thirdly, enzyme immunoassays for enalapril and enalaprilat are better than ACE inhibition assays and can be used in bioequivalence assessment of enalapril and enalaprilat and for therapeutic drug monitoring in a clinical laboratory setting.", 
    "110": "Hypertension is associated with decreased fibrinolytic potential, mainly expressed as elevated plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) levels, and increased platelet aggregability, which may account in part for the increased risk of atherosclerosis and its clinical complications in hypertensive patients. The effects of antihypertensive drugs on this prothrombotic state have been investigated and controversial findings have been reported, possibly because of differences in study designs, patients selected, and methodology used. Scarce and conflicting data exist about the effects of diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the fibrinolytic system, whereas ACE inhibitors have generally been reported to improve the fibrinolytic balance by decreasing plasma PAI-1 levels, calcium channel antagonists have been shown to increase tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity, and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists seem to exert neutral effects. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, and AT(1)-receptor antagonists have been reported to exert anti-aggregatory effects on platelets, while contrasting data exist about the influence of ACE inhibitors. Clinical implications of the changes induced by antihypertensive drugs on the fibrinolytic balance and platelet function are still debated. In particular, the question of whether these changes may translate into different degrees of cardiovascular protection in hypertensive patients remains unanswered. While awaiting more information from clinical trials, the choice of antihypertensive drugs, particularly in high-risk patients, should take into account effects beyond their BP-lowering efficacy. Selected agents should have a favorable, or at least neutral, impact on fibrinolytic function and platelet activity.",

Four weeks after discontinuation of spironolactone therapy, proteinuria returned to close to baseline values. Baseline proteinuria correlated significantly with plasma aldosterone level (r = 0.81; P < 0.0001). Moreover, baseline aldosterone level correlated significantly with degree of reduction in proteinuria after treatment with spironolactone (r = 0.70; P < 0.0001).

ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein, with an extracellular N-terminal domain containing the active site and a short intracellular C-terminal tail. A soluble form of ACE2, lacking its cytosolic and transmembrane domains, has been shown to block binding of the SARS-CoV spike protein to its receptor. In this study, we examined the ability of ACE2 to undergo proteolytic shedding and investigated the mechanisms responsible for this shedding event. We demonstrated that ACE2, heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and endogenously expressed in Huh7 cells, undergoes metalloproteinase-mediated, phorbol ester-inducible ectodomain shedding. By using inhibitors with differing potency toward different members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of proteases, we identified ADAM17 as a candidate mediator of stimulated ACE2 shedding. Furthermore, ablation of ADAM17 expression using specific small interfering RNA duplexes reduced regulated ACE2 shedding, whereas overexpression of ADAM17 significantly increased shedding. Taken together, these data provided direct evidence for the involvement of ADAM17 in the regulated ectodomain shedding of ACE2. The identification of ADAM17 as the protease responsible for ACE2 shedding may provide new insight into the physiological roles of ACE2.",

A two compartment pharmacokinetic model based on unbound concentration, in which perindoprilat bound to a single saturable binding site was used to analyze the intravenous data, whereas a one compartment model, also with saturable binding, was used for the oral data. The kinetics of perindoprilat were dose dependent with the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) varying from 920 L at a dose of 3.1 mg of perindoprilat to 470 L at a dose of 12.3 mg, in normal volunteers. Apparent unbound clearance (CLu/F) ranged from 59 to 110 L h(-1), showing no systematic trend with dose or from single to multiple dosing. Unbound clearance was strongly related to creatinine clearance in the patient studies and there was also a weak relationship between volume of distribution and creatinine clearance.

Practice audits have demonstrated that about one-half of eligible HF patients are prescribed ACE inhibitors (with fewer still reaching appropriate target doses) and less than one-third of patients with established IHD are prescribed statins (with many fewer reaching recommended cholesterol targets).

Plasma bradykinin levels are increased in experimental heart failure but low in patients with advanced chronic CHF despite treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It is not currently known how bradykinin behaves in less severe phases of CHF controlled by long-term ACE inhibitor treatment. We studied 10 male patients with clinically stable chronic CHF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II] on long-term ACE inhibitor treatment and 10 normal sex- and age-matched control subjects. High performance liquid chromatography/radioimmunoassay methods were used to evaluate plasma levels of bradykinin in relation to an array of parameters of endothelial function, coagulation and inflammation before and after stimuli of forearm arterial occlusion and physical exercise. CHF patients had higher levels of bradykinin (P = 0.008), activated factor XII (P = 0.049), interleukin-6 (P = 0.050) and tumour necrosis factor receptor II (sTNFRII) (P = 0.026) than controls. Arterial occlusion and exercise significantly increased bradykinin and von Willebrand factor levels in controls but not in CHF patients.

Fourteen beagle dogs were divided into medicated and control groups and underwent bilateral grafting of external jugular veins into the common carotid artery. Samples of normal veins were obtained from the control group during vein grafting. Vein grafts were harvested 1 week and 4 weeks after surgery in both groups. Subsequently, intimal/medial thickness was measured by staining with hematoxylin and eosin; antibodies for proliferating cell nuclear antigen were employed to determine the degree of cellular proliferation; apoptotic cells were detected using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling method. In the medicated group, the intimal/medial cross-sectional area was significantly smaller and increased 8- to 9-fold in comparison to the control group, which increased 12- to 20-fold. There was a significantly higher rate of cell proliferation in the control group, whereas the medicated group showed a significantly higher rate of apoptotic cells.

Spinal immunoreactivity to phosphoERK was more intense in animals in which the inflammation lasted longer, 7 days or more, than in rats with less time of inflammation. PhosphoERK levels were transient, since 2h after ankle stimulation spinal immunoreaction had almost disappeared. PhosphoERK immunoreactivity was not induced by movement of ankles from non-arthritic control animals, neither in monoarthritic rats in which the inflamed ankle was not stimulated. Intrathecal administration of PD 98059, an inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation, reduced nociceptive behaviour induced by the ankle bend test in monoarthritic rats. The anti-nociceptive effect of PD 98059 was more prominent and in animals with short lasting (4 days) than in animals with longer (14 days) monoarthritis. Taken together, these findings suggest that ERK phosphorylation in spinal cord neurones plays an important role in chronic inflammatory articular pain and that its inhibition may provide significant anti-nociception.", 
    "139": "The effects of 12 months of therapy were evaluated in 47 mildly symptomatic patients with moderate to severe mitral valve regurgitation; 26 patients received enalapril and 21 received a placebo. Enalapril was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular diameter and mitral regurgitation volume, with no evidence of change in systolic function indexes. However, enalapril did not hinder progressive aerobic impairment to effort.", 
    "140": "The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of fermented blue mussel sauce (FBMS) was investigated. Blue mussels were fermented with 25% NaCl (w/w) at 20 degrees C for 6 months and the resultant mixture was passed through a 40-mesh sieve, desalted using an electrodialyzer and then lyophilized. The IC(50) value of FBMS for ACE activity was 1.01 mg/ml. An ACE inhibitory peptide was purified from FBMS using Sephadex G-75 gel chromatography, SP-Sephadex C-25 ion exchange chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C(18) column. The IC(50) value of purified ACE inhibitory peptide was 19.34 microg/ml, and 10 amino acid residues of the N-terminal sequence was EVMAGNLYPG. The purified peptide was evaluated for antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) following oral administration. Blood pressure significantly decreased after peptide ingestion. This result suggested that FBMS may have beneficial effects on hypertension.", 
    "141": "From a patient's perspective, stroke is the most devastating form of cardiovascular disease, representing the number one cause of permanent disability in the United States. Treatment of hypertension significantly reduces the risk of stroke; however, it is unclear whether all antihypertensive agents are equivalent in this regard. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke. Although attenuation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is often credited with the blood pressure-independent effects of this class of agents, this hypothesis has not been confirmed with regard to the end point of stroke. In fact, drugs that activate the RAS, such as diuretics and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, are as effective or superior to ACE inhibitors for stroke prevention. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) selectively block the angiotensin II subtype I receptor, which results in a reflexive increase in levels of angiotensin II and unopposed activation of angiotensin II subtype 2 receptors. Clinical trials comparing ARBs with active controls have reported significant reductions in stroke in ARB-treated patients. Data on ARBs and other drugs that activate the RAS (diuretics and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) support a potential role for the RAS in protecting against stroke. Ongoing trials with ARBs are evaluating stroke as a primary end point, and results should help to further elucidate the role of ARBs in this disease. Until then, it is prudent to treat hypertension with an agent or combination of agents that are likely to result in a rapid and sustained reduction in blood pressure, taking into consideration patient characteristics, comorbidities, tolerability, and cost.",

    "144": "CT brain scans were obtained at a median of 2.1 days post stroke (IQ range 1.3-4.3). Patients directly admitted to the ASU received aspirin earlier post admission compared to those admitted via a medical ward (0.7 vs 2.2 days, p < 0.01) and were also more likely to receive aspirin prior to CT scan being performed (57% vs 19%, p = 0.02). 86% of stroke patients were discharged on an antiplatelet therapy, 79% on a statin, 37% on a thiazide diuretic and 32% on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II antagonist.", 
    "145": "Aspirin was given more promptly in acute stroke and more commonly prior to CT scanning in an ASU compared to a medical ward. Statin therapy is used extensively in stroke but there is a much lower rate of initiation of other secondary preventive therapies (e.g. anti-hypertensive therapy) in hospital. These findings demonstrate a hesitancy in early use of aspirin amongst general physicians and lends support for the use of stroke units.", 
    "146": "Clinicians are often faced with therapeutic dilemmas and challenges while treating children with frequently relapsing steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS) and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). In the past, children with SDNS have been treated with long-term alternate day steroids cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine (CSA), chlorambucil, levamisole, and azathioprine. The essential aim of these therapies is to maintain remission while limiting exposure to steroids. These medications have variable efficacy and undesirable toxicity profiles. Recently, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has emerged as a new therapeutic option for the management of SDNS in a few uncontrolled clinical trials. Preliminary data are encouraging. MMF was found to be useful in maintaining remission and has a steroid-sparing effect. Clearly, more data are needed to further characterize the safety and efficacy of MMF, define adequate length of treatment, and optimize drug exposure and monitoring. The management of SRNS is primarily aimed at decreasing proteinuria and inducing remission, if possible. By doing so, one would aim to preserve renal function. CSA therapy is known to be useful in this regard but has undesirable side effects, the most concerning being nephrotoxicity. MMF in combination with steroids and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor drugs is known to have some efficacy in the management of SRNS. These preliminary data have prompted the National Institutes of Health to sponsor a multicentric controlled trial to compare the safety and efficacy of MMF with that of CSA in the treatment of steroid-resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). If MMF therapy is found to be efficacious, it would help obviate the need for CSA and its associated nephrotoxicity. Clearly, MMF has emerged as an important new therapeutic option for the treatment of childhood nephrotic syndrome and FSGS. Further data are required to assess those conditions most likely to respond.", 
    "147": "The diabetic population is at high risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Approximately 80% of these patients die from a thrombotic cause, with CVD complications being involved in 75% of those. The mechanisms involved in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the diabetic population are multifactorial, including hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, ultimately leading to endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherogenesis. Thus, diabetes has become a CAD risk equivalent. Early and aggressive intervention in treating risk factors may reduce the risk of developing diabetes and may prevent CVD in patients with established diabetes.",

In this study in Wistar rats medicated for 22 months, we determined the effects of enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) and losartan (30 mg/kg/day) treatment, in comparison with vehicle (tap water), on renal AngII receptor density and circulating and urinary components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).",

Losartan and enalapril treatment elevated plasma levels of AngI and Ang-(1-7) while AngII increased only in losartan-treated rats. In contrast, both treatments were associated with a reduction in urinary excretion of all three Ang peptides as compared with control rats.",

    "152": "The prevalence and persistence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and the relative inefficacy of the currently available pharmacotherapy requires development of new treatment strategies. Recent findings have suggested a mechanistic link between inflammatory processes and the development of AF. Epidemiological studies have shown an association between C-reactive protein and both the presence of AF and the risk of developing future AF. In case-control studies, C-reactive protein is significantly elevated in AF patients and is associated with successful cardioversion. Moreover, C-reactive protein elevation is more pronounced in patients with persistent AF than in those with paroxysmal AF. Furthermore, treatment with glucocorticoids, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers seems to reduce recurrence of AF. Part of this anti-arrhythmic effect may be through anti-inflammatory activity. This article reviews what is known about inflammation in genesis and perpetuation of AF, the putative underlying mechanisms, and possible therapeutic implications for the inhibition of inflammation as an evolving treatment modality for AF.",

The usefulness of innovative versions of widely known treatment modalities was documented. These included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors against hypertension, acarabose against diabetes, and the antiplatelet agent triflusal instead of aspirin. A large British study confirmed the value of treatment with simvastatin. Appropriately powered studies found no benefit for stroke prevention of either vitamin treatment to lower homocysteine or hormonal replacement in post-menopausal women. The circumstances under which antithrombotic, anticoagulant and surgical treatments of acute ischemic stroke are appropriate were further specified.",

    "162": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease that is increasing in prevalence. It is a common cause of death and is accompanied by high direct and indirect costs for treatment. The current situation faced by patients and the medical community with regard to this ailment is one of high mortality, repeated hospitalizations, and combination therapies. The various classes of pharmacological agents that are currently used for patients suffering from CHF include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), aldosterone antagonists, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), digitalis drugs, diuretics, inotropic agents, nitrates, and vasodilators. While these agents are all important therapeutic tools in the treatment of CHF, the prognosis for patients with CHF remains poor. Thus improvement of the current pharmacological armamentarium is greatly needed. An endogenous peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), has been increasingly utilized in the setting of acute CHF since its approval in 2001. This peptide, or a derivative thereof, has great potential for the treatment of patients at various stages in the progression of heart failure. This review provides an overview of current pharmacological strategies in CHF and addresses potential future developments in the use of BNP for the treatment of CHF.", 
    "163": "Almost 5 million individuals in the United States are diagnosed with chronic heart failure (HF), and the prevalence is increasing. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers, neurohormonal antagonists that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the sympathetic nervous system, respectively, have been shown in clinical trials to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HF, and these therapies are now integral components of standard HF treatment. Yet, morbidity and mortality rates in HF remain unacceptably high, and the limitations of current standard therapies are becoming increasingly apparent. About 10% of patients with HF are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors, often because of cough. In addition, ACE inhibition may not completely block the RAS because angiotensin II, the main end product of the RAS, can be generated via non-ACE enzymatic pathways. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may exert more complete RAS blockade than ACE inhibitors by interfering with the binding of angiotensin II at the receptor level, regardless of the enzymatic pathway of production. They are also better tolerated than ACE inhibitors and have been shown to improve symptoms and function in clinical trials in patients with HF. These factors provide a strong rationale for the study of the clinical effects of ARBs in patients with HF.", 
    "164": "The objective of antihypertensive treatment in patients with chronic renal failure, many of whom have elevated blood pressure levels, is to reduce cardiovascular events and to slow down the progression of kidney function impairment. Calcium antagonists have been shown to be effective and safe antihypertensive drugs in patients from different age groups, including children. On the basis of numerous studies, one may conclude that the main benefit of antihypertensive therapy is because of the blood pressure lowering effect per se and that calcium antagonists do not differ from other antihypertensive drugs in the ability to prevent cardiovascular complications of hypertension. In particular, calcium antagonists are not inferior to other groups of antihypertensive agents in the prevention of coronary artery disease. There is, however, now evidence from controlled clinical trials that drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system are more beneficial than other antihypertensive agents in patients with chronic renal failure. Thus, several studies have demonstrated that ACE-inhibitors and, in patients with type-2 diabetic nephropathy, AT 1-antagonists are superior to other classes of antihypertensive drugs, including calcium antagonists, in delaying the progression of renal insufficiency. Therefore, in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure antihypertensive treatment should be initiated with a drug that inhibits the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "165": "The cis- and trans-isomers of enalapril and enalaprilat can be resolved by HPLC and by capillary electrophoresis. The isomeric content of enalapril is perturbed by the ionization of both its carboxyl and amine groups, while the isomeric content of enalaprilat is only perturbed by the ionization of its amine group. Increasing the hydrophobicity of the analyte solvent, as reflected in its molar polarization, increases the Z (cis) content of enalapril and markedly decreases the kinetics for isomerization. Far UV circular dichroic measurements suggest that the increase in Z (cis) content of enalapril is due to protonation of its carboxylate group. Taken together, the in-vitro properties of enalapril and enalaprilat suggest that the in-vivo transformation of the prodrug enalapril to the inhibitor enalaprilat and its delivery to angiotensin-converting enzyme should not be significantly limited by cis/trans-isomerization.", 
    "166": "In this paper, ACE inhibitory activity in insect protein hydrolyzed by various enzymes (gastrointestinal proteases, alcalase, and thermolysin) is reported for the first time. Four insects of different insect orders were tested: Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera), Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera), Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera), and Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera). ACE inhibitory activity was measured by two different methods: a spectrophotometric method using FAPGG (2-furanacryloyl-phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine) as substrate, and an HPLC method using dansyltriglycine (DTG) as substrate. Hydrolysis of the insect protein resulted in an increased ACE inhibitory activity. Overall, the highest ACE inhibitory activity was obtained after gastrointestinal digestion. These results suggest a role for insect protein as antihypertensive component in functional foods and nutraceuticals. Furthermore, the ACE inhibitory activity differed according to the method used. As a consequence, there is a need to standardize methodologies to evaluate ACE inhibitory activity.", 
    "167": "Although angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to reduce both reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by activated NAD(P)H oxidase and vascular remodeling in hypertension, the effects of AT1 receptor antagonists or ACE inhibitors on ROS-scavenging enzymes remain unclear. We hypothesized that AT1 receptor antagonists or ACE inhibitors may modulate vascular remodeling via superoxide dismutase (SOD) in hypertension. Male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were treated for 6 weeks with a vehicle, an AT1 receptor antagonist (E4177; 30 mg/kg/day), or an ACE inhibitor (cilazapril; 10 mg/kg/day). We evaluated protein expression using immunoblots, determined SOD activities with a spectrophotometric assay, and measured NAD(P)H oxidase activity by a luminescence assay. The two drugs showed equipotent effects on blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, and endothelial NO synthase in the SHRSP hearts. The wall-to-lumen ratio of the intramyocardial arteries and the NAD(P)H oxidase essential subunit p22(phox) and its activity were significantly reduced, whereas Cu/Zu-containing SOD (Cu/ZnSOD) expression and activity were significantly increased in the SHRSP hearts. Furthermore, E4177 reduced vascular remodeling more than did cilazapril not only by reducing p22(phox) expression and NAD(P)H oxidase activity but also by upregulating the Cu/ ZnSOD expression and its activity in the SHRSP hearts. Thus, both the AT1 receptor antagonist and the ACE inhibitor inhibited vascular remodeling and reduced ROS in SHRSP via not only a reduction in NAD(P)H oxidase but also an upregulation of Cu/ZnSOD.", 
    "168": "During the past years increasingly stricter criteria have been applied to the primary prevention of ischemic stroke. This applies especially to the treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. An operation is indicated for a blockage of 60% and higher, including symptom-free patients under 75 years of age. At the moment, a final conclusion on the preferred operative procedure--thromboendarterectomy or stent implantation--cannot be made. For the secondary prevention of apoplexy, the highest relative risk reduction for vascular accidents using thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors was achieved with the combination ASA plus dipyridamole. Diuretics, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are equally suitable for the reduction of blood pressure after apoplectic insult. Moreover, the latter appear to have advantages for the prevention of a renewed apoplexy. The benefit of statins in the secondary prevention of apoplexy has been substantiated by the Heart Protection Study. Simvastatin has the best evidence for its effectiveness in patients without CHD; in contrast, atorvastatin has possibly more benefits for patients with clinically evident CHD. The direct thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran, will be available as an alternative to the oral anticoagulant marcumar in the foreseeable future.", 
    "169": "We have identified 2 relatively young patients with significant hypertension, an elongated single aberrant renal artery supplying blood to a renal segment, and evidence for localization of the elevated plasma renin activity to the side and vein draining the affected kidney. Furosemide-induced diuresis and acute oral captopril stimulated the renal vein/contralateral renin ratios to 4.3:1 and 6.5:1 in patients 1 and 2, respectively. These renal vein ratios are significantly higher than normal (>3:1 under similar conditions). Partial resection of the portion of the kidney affected by the aberrant tortuous artery led to a marked reduction in blood pressure in patient 1. Patient 2, not an operative candidate, responded satisfactorily to use of a converting enzyme inhibitor, which helped to confirm the dependency of the blood pressure on the abnormal flow relationship existing within that aberrant artery and the kidney. We believe these 2 patients are representative of a small but distinct subgroup within the larger number of patients with elongated single or multiple renal aberrant arteries. Each aberrant artery had no focal stenosis, although a decrease in flow relative to the tissue perfusion demands was apparent from the marked activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the venous system draining that artery. The increased length of such vessels may contribute to their decreased flow, although their average diameter may reside just above such a critical value for a normal length vessel. This new syndrome, involving more than one component of the flow/resistance relationship, has been overlooked when renin-dependent forms of hypertension are considered.", 
    "170": "Previous studies have reported that blood pressure response to antihypertensive medications is influenced by genetic variation in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but no clinical trails have tested whether the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism modifies the association between the type of medication and multiple cardiovascular and renal phenotypes.", 
    "171": "We used a double-blind, active-controlled randomized trial of antihypertensive treatment that included hypertensives > or =55 years of age with > or =1 risk factor for cardiovascular disease. ACE I/D genotypes were determined in 37 939 participants randomized to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, lisinopril, or doxazosin treatments and followed up for 4 to 8 years. Primary outcomes included fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Secondary outcomes included stroke, all-cause mortality, combined CHD, and combined cardiovascular disease. Fatal and nonfatal CHD occurred in 3096 individuals during follow-up. The hazard rates for fatal and nonfatal CHD and the secondary outcomes were similar across antihypertensive treatments. ACE I/D genotype group was not associated with fatal and nonfatal CHD (relative risk of DD versus ID and II, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.07) or any secondary outcome. The 6-year hazard rate for fatal and nonfatal CHD in the DD genotype group was not statistically different from the ID and II genotype group by type of treatment. No secondary outcome measure was statistically different across antihypertensive treatment and ACE I/D genotype strata.",

    "174": "Six hundred ten patients enrolled in the main VALIANT study who experienced MI and evidence of LV dysfunction, heart failure, or both were enrolled in the VALIANT Echo study. Patients were randomized to receive valsartan 160 mg PO BID, captopril 50 mg PO TID, or valsartan 80 mg PO BID plus captopril 50 mg PO TID between 1 and 10 days after MI. Six hundred three patients had echocardiograms of sufficient quality for quantitative analysis. Echocardiograms were digitized, and endocardial borders were traced manually from 2 short-axis and 2 apical views. Ventricular volumes, ejection fractions, combined areas, and infarct segment length were measured, and changes in echocardiographic measures from baseline to 20 months were compared between treatment groups. Baseline clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were similar in the 3 treatment arms. The changes from baseline to 20 months in all echocardiographic parameters were similar in all 3 treatment arms. Baseline echocardiographic measures of ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, and infarct segment length were highly predictive of outcomes including total mortality, death or hospitalization for heart failure, or death or any cardiovascular event (heart failure, MI, stroke, resuscitated sudden death), even after adjustment for known covariates.",

    "176": "The objective of our study was to assess the influence of residual renal function and other factors on epoetin requirements in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients. Fifty-one stable patients (mean age +/- SD: 52 +/- 13 years; 20 women) without recent bleeding, bone marrow disease or malignancy were recruited in four Slovenian centers. The target hemoglobin was above 110 g/L. The peritoneal equilibration test results and relevant clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. The epoetin resistance index was expressed as a weekly epoetin dose/body weight/hemoglobin concentration. Twenty-four percent of the patients did not need epoetin treatment, the rest were treated with epoetin-beta in a dose of 70 +/- 56 U/kg per week s.c.; the hemoglobin concentration was 124 +/- 15 g/L. Ferritin >100 microg/L and transferrin saturation >20% fulfilled 63% of patients whose epoetin resistance index was not significantly lower (0.43 +/- 0.5 U/kg per week per g/L vs 0.6 +/- 0.72 U/kg per week per g/L, P = 0.502). No difference was found between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Treatment with angiotensin system antagonists, but not with aluminum phosphate binders, was associated with increased epoetin resistance index (0.56 +/- 0.59 vs 0.3 +/- 0.4 U/kg per week per g/L, P = 0.038). No correlation between epoetin resistance index and residual glomerular filtration rate was found (r = -0.2, P = 0.173). A multiple linear regression analysis showed C-reactive protein, intact parathormone level, female sex and treatment with angiotensin system antagonists to be the independent predictors influencing epoetin resistance index. Our results show that systemic inflammation, secondary hyperparathyroidism and angiotensin system antagonist treatment are the most important modifiable parameters affecting epoetin requirements in stable peritoneal dialysis patients.", 
    "177": "Epoetin treatment of renal anemia has been practiced in Slovenia since 1988. More than 90% of hemodialysis patients and 83% of peritoneal dialysis patients have been treated with epoetin. Epoetin has also been available for patients with renal anemia in the pre-dialysis period and for those with a failing kidney allograft. Although epoetin treatment did not accelerate the worsening of native kidney function or allograft function, intensified antihypertensive treatment was required in kidney graft recipients. In patients on peritoneal dialysis, hypervolemia had a greater effect on hypertension than did epoetin treatment. Epoetin resistance was connected with C-reactive peptide cryptorchidism, intact parathyroid hormone, and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In hemodialysis patients, lower doses of epoetin were required for patients receiving low molecular heparin and those with lower iPTH. Epoetin alpha, epoetin beta and epoetin omega seemed to be effective and safe in the treatment of renal anemia. In the past 2 years, epoetins were administered to hemodialysis patients only intravenously.", 
    "178": "Cardiovascular disease accounts for around 60% of deaths in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and diabetes is the leading cause of renal dysfunction and premature death in the UK. A key factor in these outcomes is that many people with type 2 diabetes also have raised blood pressure, which increases the likelihood of vascular complications. Lowering elevated blood pressure, using one or more antihypertensive drugs, reduces illness and mortality rates in such people. National guidelines advocate the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in selected patients with type 2 diabetes. Here we review whether such treatment offers advantages over other antihypertensive drugs.",

Typically, this disorder presents in the first three months and is caused by inherited mutations in genes encoding structural proteins of the podocyte slit membrane and, as such, is usually irreversible. Medical management is often insufficient to stem the enormous losses of protein, and the patients require nephrectomies. Here, we present results for a patient with congenital nephrotic syndrome of unknown etiology which responded to treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor alone. The patient's proteinuria relapsed when the medication was stopped, but went into complete remission after restarting treatment. This remarkable response is discussed in the light of recent investigations into the effect of angiotensin II on podocyte integrity.",

Recent trials have contributed to the knowledge base of critical therapies for the treatment of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure as it relates to arrhythmic and sudden cardiac death. Both pharmacologic and device therapies can reduce sudden cardiac death. The trials discussed in this paper have identified the pharmacologic and device interventions that are likely to improve the length and quality of life of the patient with left ventricular dysfunction and reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. The mortality and anti-arrhythmic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers have been confirmed in large-scale controlled clinical heart failure trials. Recent trials have evaluated which agents are most effective and which patients will derive the most benefit from device therapy in terms of the reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death and in the amelioration of heart failure. The recent data from the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) and the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) are discussed as the latest in the series of landmark studies that have shaped the current approaches to treating patients with heart failure and that have altered the heart failure treatment paradigm.",

Large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have shown significant beneficial effects for several classes of drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists) in patients with congestive heart failure. In most of these studies, however, elderly patients were either excluded or represented only a minority of the study population. Therefore, the treatment benefit for the large population of patients aged 65 and older is still not very well documented. In this paper, we critically review the current literature with regard to outcome of heart failure therapy in this particular subpopulation.", 
    "182": "Nicotine, a component of cigarette smoke, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We examined whether nicotine regulates angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme that plays an important role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and hypertension. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were treated with nicotine (0.1-1 microM) alone or in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 0.5 nM) or GF-109203X (GFX; 2.5 microM). The amount of ACE in intact endothelial cells was measured by an inhibitor-binding assay method, and ACE mRNA levels were quantified using LightCycler technology. Phosphorylated PKC levels were measured by Western immunoblotting. Nicotine did not modulate basal ACE production but significantly potentiated VEGF-induced ACE upregulation. Treatment of endothelial cells with the PKC inhibitor GFX totally blocked VEGF- and nicotine-induced ACE upregulation. VEGF induced PKC phosphorylation, which was potentiated by cotreatment with nicotine. We conclude that nicotine significantly potentiated VEGF-induced ACE upregulation. This effect was probably mediated by PKC phosphorylation. The interaction of nicotine with VEGF in ACE induction may contribute to the pathogenesis of smoking-related cardiovascular disease.", 
    "183": "Vascular lesions are an increasing challenge after renal transplantation due to the wider indications for recipients and acceptance criteria for donors. Diagnostic approach and prognostic interpretation are still matter of controversy. The case reported herein may summarize some of the issues in this regard. A 54-year-old woman, on renal replacement therapy since 1974, and a kidney graft recipient from 1975 to 1999, received a second graft in 2001. The donor age was 65 years (cold ischemia 22 hours; two mismatches). The early posttransplant follow-up was characterized by delayed graft function, hypertension, and diabetes. During the initial hypertension workup, renal graft ultrasound (US) Doppler demonstrated increased vascular resistances, stable over time (resistance index 0.74 to 0.77); renal scintiscan displayed homogeneously parenchymoa and angio-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an homogeneous parenchymal vascularization. Initial immunosuppression with tacrolimus and steroids was modulated by adding mycophenolate mofetil to taper tacrolimus (to reduce nephrotoxicity and hypertension). Despite this, kidney function slowly deteriorated; serum creatinine reached 3 to 3.5 mg/dL by the second year. After a severe hypertensive crisis with unchanged scintiscan and US doppler examinations, angio-MRI revealed the almost complete disappearance of parenchymal enhancement beyond the lobar arteries. A renal biopsy confirmed the severe vascular damage. The patient was switched to rapamycine and a low-dose of an angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. She did relatively well (serum creatinine 2.2 to 3 mg/dL) for 6 months, when rapid functional impairment forced her to restart hemodialysis. This case, almost paradigmatic of the problems occurring when the rigid vasculature of long-term dialysis patients is matched with \"marginal kidneys,\" suggests that MRI may be a sensible good to define vascular damage in the grafted kidney.", 
    "184": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats given N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in drinking water for 8 weeks showed: (1) a clear-cut increase in systolic blood pressure; (2) a consistent decrease of endothelial-cell nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene expression in aortic tissue; (3) a marked reduction of plasma nitrite/nitrate concentrations; (4) a reduction of the relaxant activity of acetylcholine (ACh, from 10(-10) to 10(-4) M) on norepinephrine-precontracted aortic rings (reduction by 48+/-5%); (5) a marked decrease (-58%) of the basal release of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto-PGF1alpha) from aortic rings. In L-NAME-treated rats, administration in the last 4 weeks of either the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (10 mg/kg/day in tap water) or the angiotensin AT(1)-receptor antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg/day in tap water) decreased systolic blood pressure levels, completely restored eNOS mRNA levels in aortic tissue and plasma nitrite/nitrate levels, and allowed a consistent recovery of both the relaxant activity of acetylcholine and the generation of 6-keto-PGF1alpha. Coadministration of icatibant, a bradykinin B(2)-receptor antagonist (200 microg/kg/day), with enalapril blunted the stimulatory effect of the ACE inhibitor on eNOS mRNA expression, circulating levels of nitrite/nitrate, the relaxant activity of ACh and the release of 6-keto-PGF1alpha in L-NAME-treated rats. The generation of 6-keto-PGF1alpha from aortic rings was also decreased in rats coadministered icatibant with losartan. These findings indicate that (1) the ACE inhibitor enalapril and the angiotensin AT(1)-receptor blocker losartan are equally effective to reverse NAME-induced endothelial dysfunction; (2) the beneficial effect of enalapril on the endothelial vasodilator function in L-NAME-treated rats is mediated by bradykinin B(2)-receptor activation; and (3) the enhanced endothelial generation of prostacyclin induced by losartan in L-NAME rats is also mediated by bradykinin B(2)-receptor activation.", 
    "185": "Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are involved in neuropeptide degradation and may modulate neurogenic inflammation. We therefore explored the effect of specific blockers of NEP and ACE on the intensity of neurogenic inflammation. We investigated eight subjects on three occasions. Two pairs of microdialysis fibers equipped with intraluminal wires were inserted intracutaneously into the volar forearms and electrical stimuli were delivered via the intraluminal electrodes. The microdialysis fibers were perfused either with normal saline, phosphoramidon (NEP inhibitor), or captopril (ACE inhibitor). CGRP release was assessed in the microdialysis eluate via a specific EIA and by evaluating the extent and intensity of the neurogenic flare via a laser Doppler imager. The area of hyperalgesia and allodynia was assessed during electrical stimulation. Inhibition of NEP with phosphoramidon increased flare intensity (P < 0.002) and size (P < 0.01), while blocking ACE had no effect on neurogenic vasodilation. CGRP release could be measured in microdialysis samples after phosphoramidon perfusion only (P < 0.03), not in samples with captopril or saline perfusion. No effect on the areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia could be detected. Our findings suggest that NEP but not ACE is most important for CGRP degradation in human skin. This may be of particular importance for the understanding of pain disorders like migraine or complex regional pain syndrome.",

The number of drugs correlated with age and overweight. In 1996, 51% patients received calcium channel blockers (CCB); 46% beta-blockers (BB); 32% angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI); 15% thiazide diuretics; 5% alpha-blockers; and 0% angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). In 1999, the respective figures were 52% CCB, 49% BB, 24% ACEI, 22% thiazide diuretics, 4%alpha-blockers and 2% ARB. In 2004, the respective figures were 65% CCB, 64% BB, 33% ACEI, 24% thiazide diuretics, 4% alpha-blockers and 7% ARB. Fewer patients on BBs reported side-effects. Only 11% were on alpha statin and 9% on aspirin. Blood pressure on treatment was 147 +/- 21/84 +/- 11 mmHg in 1999 and 144 +/- 21/82 +/- 11 mmHg in 2004.",

No difference was observed for microalbuminuria and proteinuria between the two groups of patients. Moreover, the ACE-inhibitors significantly delayed the progression from glomerular hyperfiltration to microalbuminuria, but not that from microalbuminuria to proteinuria.",

    "195": "Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) is now considered to be a biologically active member of the renin-angiotensin system. The functions of Ang-(1-7) are often opposite to those attributed to the main effector component of the renin-angiotensin system, Ang II. Chronic administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) increases 10- to 25-fold the plasma levels of this peptide, suggesting that part of the beneficial effects of ACEI could be mediated by Ang-(1-7). Ang-(1-7) can be formed from Ang II or directly from Ang I. Other enzymatic pathways for Ang-(1-7) generation have been recently described involving the novel ACE homologue ACE2. This enzyme can form Ang-(1-7) from Ang II or less efficiently by the hydrolysis of Ang I to Ang-(1-9) with subsequent Ang-(1-7) formation. The biological relevance of Ang-(1-7) has been recently reinforced by the identification of its receptor, the G-protein-coupled receptor Mas. Heart and blood vessels are important targets for the formation and actions of Ang-(1-7). In this review we will discuss recent findings concerning the biological role of Ang-(1-7) in the heart and blood vessels, taking into account aspects related to its formation and effects on these tissues. In addition, we will discuss the potential of Ang-(1-7) and its receptor as a target for the development of new cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "196": "Because optimal overload-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy requires ANG II, we aimed to determine the effects of blocking ANG II production [via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition] on potential mediators of hypertrophy in overloaded skeletal muscle, namely, myonuclear addition and fibroblast content. In a 2 x 2 design, adult (200-225 g) female Sprague-Dawley rats were placed into one of four groups (n = 8/group): 7-day skeletal muscle overload, sham operation, 7-day skeletal muscle overload with ACE inhibition, or sham operation with ACE inhibition. Functional overloads of the plantaris and soleus muscles were produced via bilateral surgical ablation of the synergistic gastrocnemius muscle, and ACE inhibition was accomplished by the addition of the ACE inhibitor enalapril maleate to the animals' daily drinking water (0.3 mg/ml). Myonuclear addition and extrasarcolemmal nuclear proliferation, as measured by in vivo 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling, were significantly (P < or = 0.05) increased by overload in both the slow-twitch soleus and fast-twitch plantaris muscles. Furthermore, ACE inhibition attenuated these overload-induced increases in the soleus muscle but not in the plantaris muscle. However, the effect of ACE inhibition on soleus extrasarcolemmal nuclei was not likely due to differences in fibroblast content because overload elicited significant increases in vimentin-positive areas in soleus and plantaris muscles, and these areas were unaffected by ACE inhibition in either muscle. There was no effect of ACE inhibition on any measure in sham-operated muscles. Collectively, these data indicate that ANG II may mediate the satellite cell response to overload in slow-twitch soleus but not in fast-twitch plantaris muscles and that this effect may occur independently of changes in fibroblast content.", 
    "197": "Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists have attracted much attention as anti-hypertensive agents in recent times following the discovery of side effects associated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Various lead structures of the compounds of this category are reported in the literature. Studying the structure-activity relationships (SAR) for such compounds has been a fascination for scientists and efforts have been made to identify the essential physico-chemical requirements for the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor selective, angiotensin type 2 (AT2) receptor selective and some AT,/ AT2 balanced antagonistic activity compounds. With an aim to identify the structural requirements for balanced activity and differentiate between the features individually responsible for AT1 and AT2 antagonistic activities, a quantitative SAR (QSAR) analysis was carried out on a series of triazolinone based balanced AII receptor antagonists. The statistically significant equations with r > 0.88, chance < 0.01, q2 > 0.60 and F values at least three times greater than those reported were obtained for both AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes antagonistic activities. A comparative study of the parameters responsible for AT1 and AT2 receptor antagonistic activities is carried out in order to identify the features that can be modulated to obtain balanced compounds. It has been observed that the most reliable equations obtained in the study show the contribution of hydrophobic parameters: logarithm of partition coefficient (logP), thermodynamic parameters: bend energy (Eb), and electronic parameters: electronic energy (Eelec) parameters towards AT1 anatgonistic activity, and thermodynamic parameters: total energy (E), steric parameters: principal moment of inertia along the Y-axis (PMIY) and electronic parameters: electronic energy (Eelec) parameters towards AT2 antagonistic activity. The parameter Eelec is common but its effect towards the two activities is opposite, negative for AT1 and positive for AT2.",

Systolic blood pressure was measured every two weeks, renal blood flow (RBF), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal vascular resistance (RVR) were determined at Weeks 6 and 12, creatinine clearance and proteinuria at Weeks -3 (see measurements), 6 and 12. The rats were sacrificed at Weeks 6 and 12 after the second ADR injection. Glomerular sclerosis, tubulointerstitial and blood vessel changes were determined by semiquantitative scoring.",

Prevention should begin in childhood with healthy nutrition, daily physical activity, and annual measurement of weight, height, and blood pressure beginning at 3 years of age. Such screenings will identify cardiovascular risk factors early, allow the health care provider to define global cardiovascular risk with the COSEHC Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Tool, and allow treatment of each risk factor. Lifelong lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapy will be required in most patients. Antihypertensive therapy for these patients should begin with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker unless a compelling indication for another drug is present. Metformin should be considered the first drug for glucose control in the patient with type 2 diabetes. A statin should be used initially for hyperlipidemia unless contraindicated. Combinations of antihypertensive, antiglycemic, and lipid-lowering agents will often be required.", 
    "204": "Current guidelines give evidence-based advice on how best to manage anaemia in patients with renal disease, but these guidelines do not consider individual patient needs, so tailoring anaemia management to each patient still remains a challenge for the treating physician. Two case studies are described that illustrate some of the key factors that need to be considered. The first case emphasizes that haemoglobin (Hb) targets recommended in current guidelines may not suit all patients. The patient had been stably maintained on subcutaneous epoetin therapy with an average Hb concentration of >13.0 g/dl because he developed angina symptoms when his Hb level fell to 12.2 g/dl. Iron deficiency was identified as the likely cause of falling Hb in this patient. After the patient's iron supplementation was increased, his Hb level was normalized back to >13.0 g/dl without increasing the epoetin dose, and the angina symptoms were resolved. The second case involved a pre-dialysis patient with diabetes, who required a higher dose of epoetin after beginning concomitant antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Previously, the treatment of renal anaemia in pre-dialysis patients has not been the focus of attention. Two ongoing randomized controlled trials have been designed to study early initiation of epoetin treatment in pre-dialysis patients and will provide much needed information in this area.",

The aim of this survey was to assess the current treatment policy in these patients in the Netherlands. A questionnaire was sent to all 136 departments of adult or pediatric cardiology in the Netherlands. It was returned by 61% of the departments. Sixty-six percent of the respondents started medical treatment (ie, an ACE inhibitor and/or a beta-blocker) in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic A-CD. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents indicated that their treatment decision was based on published findings in the literature, but none of them referred to studies evaluating the treatment of asymptomatic A-CD. A majority of adult and pediatric cardiologists started medical treatment in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic A-CD without knowledge of the benefits and risks of treatment in this patient group. Before ACE inhibitors and/or beta-blockers can be recommended as routine practice in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic A-CD, randomized controlled trials should be performed. Until then, the authors recommend centralizing the treatment of childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic A-CD in a specialized center to cluster the available knowledge and experience.",

Therefore, treating hypertension and protecting the kidney from deterioration are exceedingly important. Although previous studies have explored the renal effects of various antihypertensive drugs in animal models and humans, recent clinical trials are all the more convincing. This review summarizes the latest data demonstrating the physiologic evidence of renoprotection by antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "210": "Experimental studies in various models of hypertension with renal injury have demonstrated clearly that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, or aldosterone antagonists promote beneficial renal actions, through hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic mechanisms. Of particular significance, recent clinical trials have demonstrated renoprotection by angiotensin II inhibition in patients with hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade have provided equivalent renal benefits, and their dual action seems to confer greater renoprotection. The available data on the renal outcomes of other antihypertensive drugs such as calcium antagonists have been inconsistent.",

    "213": "In the past year, a number of exciting concepts have come to the forefront. First, data on the use of brain natriuretic peptide as a screening biomarker has shown promise in patients with symptoms of heart failure. For the earliest detection of structural changes, serum propeptide of procollagen type I, a marker of the deposition of type I collagen in the cardiac interstitium provides a noninvasive way to quantify myocardial fibrosis. Treatment options in the past few years have focused heavily on the anti-fibrotic effects of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, perhaps supplanting beta blockers as first-line agents to regress left ventricular hypertrophy. The concept of aldosterone escape is discussed, highlighting the importance of aldosterone inhibitors in these patients. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive review of all antihypertensive classes and their effects on hypertensive heart disease.",

    "216": "Pulse pressure has emerged as a better predictor of cardiac ischemic events than systolic, diastolic, and mean brachial pressure. Central systolic and pulse pressure and augmentation index have shown an even better relation with cardiovascular events and with outcomes. The claim by specific angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker drugs of their benefits \"beyond blood pressure lowering\" has been challenged on the basis of greater reduction in central and aortic pressure compared with brachial pressure measured by cuff sphygmomanometer, as shown by the pREterax in regression of Arterial Stiffness in a contrOlled double-bliNd study. Augmentation index is higher in hypertension, is inversely related to body height, and can be reduced by exercise. Augmentation index shows a linear relation with age up to 60 years. Regrettably, recent major trials such as the Comparison of Amlodipine versus Enalapril to Limit Occurrences of Thrombosis, Prevention of Events with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition, and Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation studies have not included pulse wave analysis to distinguish the relative benefit of different drugs.",

At the final visit (12 months) in the 269 patients studied, the decrease in PP was greater, and the proportion of patients with CRP >3 mg/L lower (17.9% versus 28. 9%, P=0.03; adjusted odds ratio, 1.02 to 4.08, P=0.01), in the perindopril plus indapamide group than in the atenolol group. After adjustment for confounders, patients with a baseline CRP >3 mg/L displaying the greatest decrease in PP were more likely (P=0.04) to have a CRP < or =3 mg/L at 12 months. No such relationship was found with systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Perindopril-indapamide combination therapy is more effective than beta-blockade in lowering elevated CRP in hypertensive subjects.

    "228": "Pentosidine accumulates in non-diabetic proteinuric kidneys in damaged tubules, and renoprotective treatment by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors inhibits AGE accumulation, supporting a relationship between abnormal renal protein trafficking, proteinuria-induced tubular damage and tubular pentosidine accumulation. Future studies, applying specific AGE inhibitors, should be conducted to provide insight into the pathophysiological significance of renal AGEs in non-diabetic renal disease.", 
    "229": "The temporal and spatial expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was assessed in the left ventricle of a myocardial infarction (MI) model of injury with and without angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Coronary artery ligated rats were killed 1, 3, 7, 28, and 180 days after MI. TGF-beta(1), CTGF, and procollagen alpha1(I) mRNA were localized by in situ hybridization, and TGF-beta(1) and CTGF protein levels by immunohistochemistry. Collagen protein was measured using picrosirius red staining. In a separate group, rats were treated for 6 months with an ACE inhibitor. There were temporal and regional differences in the expression of TGF-beta(1), CTGF, and collagen after MI. Procollagen alpha1(I) mRNA expression increased in the border zone and scar peaking 1 week after MI, whereas collagen protein increased in all areas of the heart over the 180 days. Expression of TGF-beta(1) mRNA and protein showed major increases in the border zone and scar peaking 1 week after MI. The major increases in CTGF mRNA and protein occurred in the viable myocardium at 180 days after MI. Long-term ACE inhibition reduced left ventricular mass and decreased fibrosis in the viable myocardium, but had no effect on cardiac TGF-beta(1) or CTGF. TGF-beta(1) is involved in the initial, acute phase of inflammation and repair after MI, whereas CTGF is involved in the ongoing fibrosis of the heart. The antifibrotic benefits of captopril are not mediated through a reduction in CTGF.",

    "231": "Prospective study conducted with 394 patients admitted for HF-related emergencies at 4 Spanish hospitals. Baseline HRQL was measured with a generic questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36), and with an HF-specific instrument, the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure (MLWHF) questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for hospitalization and death on the basis of HRQL scores.", 
    "232": "During a median follow-up of approximately 6 months, 138 patients (35.0%) underwent a first emergency rehospitalization and 70 (17.8%) died. After adjustment for biomedical, psychosocial, and health care variables, the frequency of hospital readmission was higher in patients with worse scores on the SF-36 physical functioning (HR, 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.44; P = .01), general health (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.19-2.52; P = .003), and mental health (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.10-2.47; P = .02) subscales. Results were similar for the mortality end point. For the MLWHF questionnaire, worse overall and worse physical and emotional summary scores were associated with higher mortality.", 
    "233": "Worse HRQL is associated with hospital readmission and death in patients with HF. The magnitude of this association, for both physical and mental HRQL components, is comparable to that for other well-known predictors of hospital readmission and death, such as personal history of diabetes, previous hospitalizations, and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "234": "Increasing number of diabetic patients develop different stages of renal failure. However, often an inappropriate parameter, the serum creatinine is measured as a marker of glomerular function. Calculated glomerular filtration rate or endogenous creatinine clearance are suggested to be used for the estimation of the glomerular function. Important structures preventing proteinuria in the kidney are glomerular basement membrane, podocytes and proximal tubular cells. In diabetes mellitus loss of nephrin of podocytes can play a role in the development of microalbuminuria, and podocyte desquamation may result in the progression to proteinuria. In diabetes mellitus there is an increased formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE), of which the only elimination organ is the kidney. The AGE induce proteinuria and atherosclerosis. Therefore, in diabetes mellitus a vicious circle develops due to proteinuria, nephron loss and accumulation of AGE, which play a role in the initiation and progression of diabetic nephropathy and atherosclerosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers having antiproteinuric effect may decrease the risk of diabetic nephropathy and atherosclerosis. Improvement of carbohydrate metabolism with a consequential decrease in the formation of AGE is an important contributor to the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy and atherosclerosis.", 
    "235": "We reviewed the transplantation data and results of histopathological studies with additional angiotensin II (AII) immunostaining of renal graft biopsies of nine cases (10 grafts) with recurrent proteinuria and three controls without recurrent proteinuria that received renal transplantation for primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) between 1986 and 2002. Recurrent FSGS was confirmed in six grafts from nine cases by light microscopy. In cases with recurrent proteinuria, loss of graft function was noted in all six renal grafts received between 1986 and early 1992 but in none of four grafts received between late 1992 and 2002. Two of four patients of the late group but none of those of the early group received angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) with plasma exchange (PE). In control cases without proteinuria, AII immunostaining was detected in tubules but not in glomeruli in 1-hour biopsies as well as later on. In cases with recurrent proteinuria, AII immunostaining was detected in both tubules and glomeruli, although glomerular AII staining was not observed in 1-hour biopsies. Our results suggest that effective treatment of post-transplantation recurrent FSGS requires ACEI or ARB with PE in the absence of another etiology.", 
    "236": "Sir John Vane named vascular endothelium 'the maestro of blood circulation'. Recently, 'the maestro' has become a target for pharmacotherapy of atherothrombotic and diabetic vasculopathies with well known cardio-vascular drugs belonging to the families of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors or beta1-Adrenoceptor antagonists. These drugs became upgraded to a position of the pleiotropic endothelial drugs. It is not a simple verbal change in the nomenclature. It means that these drugs apart from their well defined mechanisms of action, as indicated in their regular names, in addition they act in an unknown mechanism at the level of vascular endothelium preventing angina, myocardial infarction and stroke. Many biochemical events take place in endothelial cells. I chose for a closer inspection the nitric oxide/prostacyclin defensive system to explain the endothelial pleiotropism of the drugs in question. I tried to examine the validity of this conception according to the general rule: in vitro cognitio sed in vivo veritas.", 
    "237": "The purpose of the present paper was to study some of the underlying physical and technical aspects of high-throughput quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) of small drug molecules. A prototype MALDI-triple quadrupole instrument equipped with a high repetition rate laser was employed. Initially, the detection limits and dynamic ranges for the quantitation of four drugs (quinidine, danofloxacin, ramipril and nadolol) were determined. Internal standards were carefully chosen for each of these analytes in terms of structure similarity and fragmentation pathways. Three organic matrices were tested for these assays, resulting in different crystallization behaviors and measurement reproducibilities. alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid yielded the best results and was subsequently employed for the quantitative determination of all four analytes. Further experiments considered the role of laser energy and pulse rate on the ablated areas as well as ion signals. Light microscope and scanning electron microscope images allowed the examination of the ablated area of the MALDI spots. The images showed convincing evidence that the ablated area was virtually void of crystals after analysis, with no preferential removal of material in the center of the laser's path. Average values for the amount of material ablated were determined to be 3.9+/-0.5% of the total spot size, and as low as 19.5 attomoles of analyte were detectable for our most sensitive analyte, ramipril. It was calculated that, under these assay conditions, it was possible to accurately quantify less than 1 femtomole of all analytes with the use of appropriately pure internal standards. These studies showed very promising results for the quantitative nature of MALDI for small molecules with molecular weights less than 500 Da.",

    "239": "The plasma Ang II level was assayed with 125I-Ang II radioimmunoassay, and the expression of AT1 in blood vessel and kidney was analyzed with immunohistochemical technique.", 
    "240": "The plasma Ang II level was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic rats (241 +/- 49) pg x mL(-1) than that in the control (71 +/- 22) pg x mL , high fat diet group (151 +/- 29) pg x mL(-1) (P < 0.01) , and enalapril-treated groups (136 +/- 25) pg x mL(-1) (P < 0.05). The plasma Ang II levels in high fat diet and in enalapril-treated groups were also significantly higher than that in control group ( P < 0.01 ). With immunohistochemical technique, it was found that the expression of AT1 in endothelial cells of blood vessels, vascular smooth muscle cells, and kidneys in diabetic group increased. The expression of AT1 in endothelial cells of blood vessels, vascular smooth muscle cells, and kidney in enalapril-treated group was similar to that in control group.",

    "242": "Edema is the result of an imbalance in the filtration system between the capillary and interstitial spaces. The kidneys play a key role in regulating extracellular fluid volume by adjusting sodium and water excretion. Major causes of edema include venous obstruction, increased capillary permeability, and increased plasma volume secondary to sodium and water retention. A systematic approach is warranted to determine the underlying diagnosis. Treatment includes sodium restriction, diuretic use, and appropriate management of the underlying disorder. Leg elevation may be helpful in some patients. Loop diuretics often are used alone or in combination. In patients with New York Heart Association class III and IV congestive heart failure, spironolactone has been found to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. In patients with cirrhosis, ascites is treated with paracentesis and spironolactone. Dihydropyridine-induced edema can be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. Lymphedema occurs when a protein-rich fluid accumulates in the interstitium. Compression garments and range-of-motion exercises may be helpful in patients with this condition.", 
    "243": "The objective of the study was to assess factors associated with treatment satisfaction among patients receiving antihypertensive therapy. A weighted cross-sectional online survey was conducted with hypertensive patients participating in a chronic disease panel in the US. Patients on monotherapy with medications from the following classes were identified: ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta blockers (BBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and diuretics. The control group included patients without treatment. Pairwise comparisons between groups were conducted for factors that may affect patients' satisfaction. The study population had a mean age of 54.7+/-14.2 years and was 56.7% female. Participants with blood pressure (BP) controlled to JNC 7 guidelines were more satisfied with their medication than those with uncontrolled BP (90.3 vs 71.5%, P<0.05). Patients who had not experienced adverse events had higher satisfaction than patients experiencing adverse events (90.9 vs 75.8%, P<0.05). The most frequently self-reported adverse events were frequent urination, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue ranging from 7.0 to 9.6% across classes. The adverse event rates differed by class and were lowest among the ARBs. Patients on ARBs were the most likely to have switched from a previous antihypertensive class as compared to other classes (57.1% ARBs vs 49.8% ACEIs, 38.7% diuretics, 36.3% CCBs, and 31.7% BBs). Physician recommendation was the most common reason for switching. In conclusion, the ability to effectively treat hypertension depends upon a patient's satisfaction with antihypertensive therapy, which may be improved by achieving BP control and minimizing the occurrence of adverse events.", 
    "244": "Peptide hormones such as ANG II and endothelin contribute to cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction by stimulating myocyte hypertrophy and myofibroblast proliferation. In contrast, angiotensin-(1-7) [ANG-(1-7)] infusion after myocardial infarction reduced myocyte size and attenuated ventricular dysfunction and remodeling. We measured the effect of ANG-(1-7) on protein and DNA synthesis in cultured neonatal rat myocytes to assess the role of the heptapeptide in cell growth. ANG-(1-7) significantly attenuated either fetal bovine serum- or endothelin-1-stimulated [(3)H]leucine incorporation into myocytes with no effect on [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. [d-Ala(7)]-ANG-(1-7), the selective ANG type 1-7 (AT(1-7)) receptor antagonist, blocked the ANG-(1-7)-mediated reduction in protein synthesis in cardiac myocytes, whereas the AT(1) and AT(2) angiotensin peptide receptors were ineffective. Serum-stimulated ERK1/ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was significantly decreased by ANG-(1-7) in myocytes, a response that was also blocked by [d-Ala(7)]-ANG-(1-7). Both rat heart and cardiac myocytes express the mRNA for the mas receptor, and a 59-kDa immunoreactive protein was identified in both extracts of rat heart and cultured myocytes by Western blot hybridization with the use of an antibody to mas, an ANG-(1-7) receptor. Transfection of cultured myocytes with an antisense oligonucleotide to the mas receptor blocked the ANG-(1-7)-mediated inhibition of serum-stimulated MAPK activation, whereas a sense oligonucleotide was ineffective. These results suggest that ANG-(1-7) reduces the growth of cardiomyocytes through activation of the mas receptor. Because ANG-(1-7) is elevated after treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or AT(1) receptor blockers, ANG-(1-7) may contribute to their beneficial effects on cardiac dysfunction and ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.", 
    "245": "Synthetic analogues of the bradykinin potentiating nonapeptide BPP9alpha indicate significantly different structural requirements for potentiation of the bradykinin (BK)-induced smooth muscle contraction (GPI) and the inhibition of isolated somatic angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). The results disprove the ACE inhibition as the only single mechanism and also the direct interaction of potentiating peptides with the bradykinin receptors in transfected COS-7 cells as molecular mechanism of potentiation. Our results indicate a stimulation of inositol phosphates (IPn) formation independently from the B2 receptor. Furthermore, the results with La3+ support the role of extracellular Ca2+ and its influx through corresponding channels. The missing effect of calyculin on the GPI disproves the role of phosphatases in the potentiating action. These experimental studies should not only contribute to a better understanding of the potentiating mechanisms but also incorporate a shift in the research towards the immune system, in particular towards the immunocompetent polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The chemotaxis of these cells can be potentiated most likely by exclusive inhibition of the enzymatic degradation of bradykinin. Thus the obtained results give evidence that the potentiation of the bradykinin action can occur by different mechanisms, depending on the system and on the applied potentiating factor.", 
    "246": "Recent trials suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are effective in prevention of ischemic stroke, as measured by reduced stroke incidence. We aimed to compare stroke severity between stroke patients who were taking ACEI before their stroke onset and those who were not, to examine the effects of pretreatment with ACEI on ischemic stroke severity.", 
    "247": "We retrospectively studied 126 consecutive patients presenting within 24 hours of ischemic stroke onset, as confirmed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). We calculated the NIHSS score at presentation, as the primary measure of clinical stroke severity, and categorized stroke severity as mild (NIHSS [less than or equal to] 7), moderate (NIHSS 8-13) or severe (NIHSS [greater than or equal to] 14). We analyzed demographic data, risk-factor profile, blood pressure (BP) and medications on admissions, and determined stroke mechanism according to TOAST criteria. We also measured the volumes of admission diffusion- and perfusion-weighted (DWI /PWI) magnetic resonance imaging lesions, as a secondary measure of ischemic tissue volume. We compared these variables among patients on ACEI and those who were not.", 
    "248": "Thirty- three patients (26%) were on ACE-inhibitors. The overall median baseline NIHSS score was 5.5 (range 2-21) among ACEI-treated patients vs. 9 (range 1-36) in non-ACEI patients (p = 0.036). Patients on ACEI prior to their stroke had more mild and less severe strokes, and smaller DWI and PWI lesion volumes compared to non-ACEI treated patients. However, none of these differences were significant. Predictably, a higher percentage of patients on ACEI had a history of heart failure (p = 0.03). Age, time-to-imaging or neurological evaluation, risk-factor profile, concomitant therapy with lipid lowering, other antihypertensives or antithrombotic agents, or admission BP were comparable between the two groups.", 
    "249": "Our results suggest that ACE-inhibitors may reduce the clinical severity of stroke, as measured by NIHSS score. Further, larger-scale, prospective studies are needed to validate our findings, and to elucidate the mechanism(s) of ACEImediated benefits in patients with ischemic stroke.", 
    "250": "Elderly patients have much more complex QOL problems as compared with young or middle-aged patients because of their specific social and psychological circumstances, as well as their multiple organ disorders. Specifically, one should take into account, in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly with respect to QOL, the effect of antihypertensive drugs on the cognitive function and the influence on other diseases or hypertensive complications. Most of the currently used antihypertensive drugs are shown to be inert to the cognitive function. In order to maintain or improve QOL of elderly hypertensive patients, adequate drugs should be selected individually. In general, ACE inhibitors, long-acting Ca antagonists are the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension in the elderly with regard to QOL.", 
    "251": "Although the cardiovascular events such as stroke, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction can occur at any time of day, it has been known that the peak incidence of the cardiovascular events increases during the morning period. In elderly hypertensives, a greater morning blood pressure surge is associated with an advanced silent cerebrovascular disease as well as a higher incidence of stroke. Thus, the blood pressure control of the early morning period may become an important therapeutic strategy for preventing the cardiovascular events. In this review, we focused on the recent strategy for morning blood pressure rising in the elderly hypertensives.", 
    "252": "Considerable evidence of the usefulness of antihypertensive therapy in elderly hypertensive patients has been shown by the clinical intervention studies in western countries, using diuretics, beta-blockers, Ca antagonist, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Only two intervention studies on elderly hypertensive patients, which are NICS-EH and JATE, have been reported in Japan. Several Japanese intervention studies, such as JATOS, COPE, CASE-J, HOMED-BP and VALISH which conducted recently will provide us with new evidence in elderly hypertensive patients. We summarize the content of intervention studies on elderly hypertensive patients in western countries and Japan.", 
    "253": "Many large-scale intervention trials performed in Western countries have proven the necessity of treatment of hypertension in the elderly, including isolated systolic hypertension. However, it is still unclear the benefit of antihypertensive treatment in mild hypertensive patients and that in very elderly patients with hypertension. An ongoing clinical trial, the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET), may clarify whether or not antihypertensive treatment is beneficial in the very elderly. Regarding target blood pressure, there is no clinical study in which average of systolic blood pressure at the end of study decreased lower than 140 mmHg. Regarding the first-line drugs for elderly hypertension, usefulness of diuretics and calcium channel blockers has been demonstrated in studies with placebo control group. Usefulness of inhibitors of the rennin-angiotensin system has been also reported in LIFE substudy and ANBP2. It is still required to perform large scale trials in the elderly hypertension to answer these undissolved problems.", 
    "254": "Elderly people with hypertension and hyperlipidemia are regarded as high-risk patients and are supposed to be treated with appropriate drugs. From the evidence of clinical trials, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and calcium channel blockers would be the first choices, and the combination therapy with diuretics or alpha-blockers would be the next choice. However, since the effect of anti-hypertensive drugs on plasma lipids is much less than that of the lipid-lowering drugs, anti-hypertensive drugs should be chosen in consideration of the patient's complicated diseases, because elderly people are often affected with other more serious complications such as ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, renal dysfunction, and chronic lung disease. If hyperlipidemia remains after anti-hypertensive drugs are used, the use of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins is recommended.", 
    "255": "The number of an elderly patient who has hypertension with diabetes mellitus has been increasing year by year since the life style of people has become Americanized in our country. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by hypertension, dyslipidemia, central adiposity and insulin resistance. It is recently recognized as the high risk for the macrovascular disease such as cerebral infarction and acute myocardial infarction. In diabetic patients, to prevent the life-threatening event or slow complications intensive blood pressure control is as efficacious as good glycemic control. The optimal blood pressure level to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality in diabetic elderly has been proposed 130/80 mmHg in JSH 2004. The blood pressure level in the elderly should be lowered very slowly with careful monitoring of systemic ischemia. Early use of antihypertensive drug combinations is gaining favor. As the first step therapy would be recommended angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and sustained release calcium channel blocker. Especially in the elderly, good control of life-style related diseases would be achieved through a team effort comprising the clinician, psychologist, nurse, pharmacologist, dietitian, other professionals and the patient's family. Comprehensive geriatric assessment can facilitate the maintenance of drug compliance for well control of blood pressure level.", 
    "256": "The guideline of Japanese Society of Hypertension in 2004 was opened in the early January in 2005. This recommends that blood pressure of the elderly people with hypertension should be lower as well as that of the young subjects. However, unfortunately, this does not mention how much lower blood pressure of the elderly hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency is. Our group has proposed the combination therapy with a low dose of more than 2 antihypertensive drugs to reduce blood pressure of these subjects in order to avoid adverse effects of antihypertensive agents. As the combination therapy, drugs with inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system such as ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and a calcium antagonist or diuretics are suggested.", 
    "257": "Incidence and prevalence of heart failure, in the form of systolic or diastolic ventricular dysfunction, are particularly common in elderly patients with hypertension. The importance of treating hypertension in the elderly as a means of preventing chronic heart failure was emphasized by recent trials including meta-analysis. Fastidious blood pressure control by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists along with low-doses diuretics as first-line therapy is recommended. However, many elderly patients with hypertension have other risk factors, target organ damages and associated cardiovascular conditions, to which the choice of the first drug should be tailored. In such cases, beta blockers, aldosterone blockers and long-acting Ca antagonists are also recommended.", 
    "258": "Many clinical trials have been conducted to prevent cardiovascular complications and reduce mortality in hypertensive patients. Undoubted, but limited effects of beta-blocker and diuretic antihypertensive drugs had been established. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor antagonist lowered the incidence of events and mortality less than classical antihypertensive drugs, recent studies revealed that prompt and enough lowering the blood pressure is more important than choosing the types of drugs.", 
    "259": "Hypertension is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Recently, many mega-studies have been shown that antihypertensive therapy reduced the incidence of stroke not only for normal elderly but also for patients with a past history of stroke. To prevent the recurrences of stroke, tighter control of blood pressure is thought to be required than used to be. According to the recent Japanese guidelines for hypertension, desirable blood pressure should be 140/90 mmHg or less for the patients with stroke.", 
    "260": "Vascular endothelium plays important roles in vascular relaxing, anti-atherosclerotic, or anti-thrombotic effect through production of vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide. Accumulated evidences suggest that endothelial dysfunction is the initial step in the development of atherosclerosis. Recently, less invasive or non-invasive method such as venous occlusion plethysmography and measurement of flow-mediated dilatation has been developed to evaluate endothelial function. Several investigations using these methods showed that endothelial function is impaired with aging. The mechanism of endothelial dysfunction with aging remains to be fully elucidated, although oxidative stress may be involved in impairment of endothelial function.", 
    "261": "The mechanisms associated with aldosterone production both systemically and locally as well as the effects of aldosterone blockade on the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) have been extensively reviewed in this series and elsewhere. This article will review the clinical evidence supporting the use of aldosterone blocking agents (AB)in patients with HF and speculate on some potential future uses.", 
    "262": "Collagen is the major extracellular matrix protein in the heart and represents a crucial target for anti-remodeling and cardioprotective therapy. Collagen quantity and quality have been shown to be regulated under various physiological and pathologic conditions. Excessive deposition of collagen, leading to cardiac fibrosis, is a major determinant of cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmogenecity associated with sudden death. Serological markers of collagen turnover were proven as a noninvasive reliable tool for monitoring from a distance cardiac tissue repair and fibrosis, both in experimental and clinical conditions. Some markers of collagen synthesis and degradation were shown to have a prognostic significance in myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, and were reported as independent predictors of mortality. Aldosterone represents the end-product of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and may play a role in cardiac collagen deposition independent of its effect on blood pressure. Production of aldosterone is mainly regulated by angiotensin II and is activated in the failing human ventricle in proportion to heart failure severity. Circulating or locally produced aldosterone stimulates fibrillar collagen accumulation in the heart directly via mineralocorticoid receptors or, indirectly, modifying angiotensine II receptors number and/or function. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists counters collagen deposition, even when used on top of classical RAAS inhibitors, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensine II receptor blockers. There is now accumulating evidence from experimental and clinical studies showing antifibrotic and cardioprotective effect for aldosterone antagonists, spironolactone and eplerenone. In chronic heart failure and post myocardial infarction patients, aldosterone receptor blockade benefit was associated with decreased serum levels of collagen synthesis marker PIIINP (procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide), without affecting collagen degradation. Understanding various autocrine/paracrine mechanisms involved in extracellular matrix remodeling in heart failure represents a major challenge, essential for developing new cardioreparative and cardioprotective strategies.", 
    "263": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a central role in the development of hypertension and the progression of end-organ damage. Although angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) subtype-1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists can initially suppress plasma aldosterone, it is now well established that aldosterone escape may occur whereby aldosterone levels return to, or exceed, baseline levels. The classical effects of aldosterone relate mainly to its action on epithelial cells to regulate water and electrolyte balance. However, the presence of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) at nonepithelial sites in the brain, heart and vasculature, is consonant with the fact that aldosterone also has direct effects in these tissues. Substantial evidence now exists that supports the action of aldosterone at non-epithelial sites which in turn provokes a number of deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system including necrosis and fibrosis of the vasculature and the heart, vascular stiffening and injury, reduced fibrinolysis, endothelial dysfunction, catecholamine release and production of cardiac arrhythmias. Several studies have now shown that vascular and target-organ protective effects of MR antagonism occurs in the absence of significant blood pressure lowering or fluid loss, which is consistent with a major role for endogenous mineralocorticoids as direct mediators of cardiovascular injury. Adverse cardiovascular effects may occur in response to aldosterone alone, activation of the RAAS or aldosterone escape during chronic ACE inhibition or AT(1) receptor antagonism. The specific blockade of aldosterone action should prove to be of great therapeutic value in the prevention of cerebral and renal vascular disease and associated end-organ damage.", 
    "264": "Aldosterone, the final product of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, is classically viewed as a regulator of renal sodium and potassium handling, blood volume, and blood pressure. Recent studies suggest that aldosterone can cause microvascular damage, vascular inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. In animal models, aldosterone-mediated vascular injury in the brain, heart, and kidneys leads to stroke, myocardial injury, and proteinuria. These effects may be modified by dietary salt intake; aldosterone-mediated vascular damage is increased in susceptible animals fed a high-salt diet compared to a low-salt diet despite lower plasma aldosterone levels on the high-salt diet. In humans, there is a growing literature supporting the adverse effects of aldosterone in heart failure, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and renal disease. Aldosterone receptor antagonists are beneficial even in patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and attenuate aldosterone-mediated vascular injury by mechanisms that appear to be independent of changes in systolic blood pressure. This review focuses on the adverse effects of aldosterone on the vascular system and describes our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms for this injury.",

This was a retrospective claims analysis of Kansas Medicaid beneficiaries hospitalized for HF between July 1, 2000, and March 31, 2001. HF drugs were tracked 6 months prior and 6 months following the admission. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor doses were compared with target ranges. The cohort of 135 patients had a mean age of 53.6 years and was predominantly female (66.7%) and Caucasian (70.4%) with a high prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities. Before hospitalization, less than one third of patients were receiving ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, digoxin, or vasodilators. Following hospitalization, increased utilization was observed for beta blockers, digoxin, and angiotensin receptor blockers, but overall usage remained low. ACE inhibitors and vasodilator use remained constant. ACE-inhibitor doses were below target ranges before and after hospitalization. In this Medicaid cohort, HF-related hospitalizations did not lead to improved HF therapy.",

The patients in group 1 were more likely to have renal failure (p = 0.035), a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.005), and hypotension at baseline (p = 0.002). At year 2, more patients in group 1 were maintained by therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) [p = 0.036]. The survival rate over 4 years was better for group 1. Univariate Cox proportional hazard ratios revealed that age, not receiving ACEIs or ARBs, and renal disease or cancer at baseline were associated with mortality. When controlling for these variables in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards ratio model, survival differences between groups remained significant (p = 0.021). Subjects in group 2 were 2.4 times more likely to die over the 4-year period than those in group 1.",

    "272": "Diabetes induces oxidative stress and leads to attenuation of cardiac K+ currents. We investigated the role of superoxide ions and angiotensin II (ANG II) in generating and linking oxidative stress to the modulation of K+ currents under diabetic conditions. K+ currents were measured using patch-clamp methods in ventricular myocytes from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Superoxide ion levels, indicating oxidative stress, were measured by fluorescent labelling with dihydroethidium (DHE). ANG II content was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent asssay (ELISA). The results showed DHE fluorescence to be significantly higher in cells from diabetic males, compared to controls. Relief of stress by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin or by superoxide dismutase (SOD) but not by catalase reversed the attenuation of K+ currents and reduced DHE fluorescence. In cells from diabetic females, neither apocynin nor SOD augmented K+ currents, ANG II was not elevated and DHE fluorescence was significantly weaker than in cells from males. Reduced glutathione (GSH) also augmented K+ currents in cells from diabetic males but not females. In ovariectomized diabetic females K+ currents were augmented by GSH and apocynin. Current augmentation and the attenuation of DHE fluorescence by apocynin were significantly blunted by excess ANG II (300 nm). Diabetic male rats pretreated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril were hyperglycaemic, but their cellular ANG II levels and DHE fluorescence were significantly decreased. In cells from these rats, K+ currents were insensitive to apocynin. In conclusion, diabetes-related oxidative stress attenuates K+ currents through ANG II-generated increased superoxide ion levels. When ANG II levels are lower, as in diabetic females or following ACE inhibition in males, oxidative stress is reduced, with blunted alterations in K+ currents.",

Mortality increases with NYHA functional class, but the relative percentage due to sudden death is higher in lower NYHA functional classes (50-80% in NYHA class II, 30-50% in NYHA class III, and 5-30% in NYHA class IV). No antiarrhythmic drug is useful to prevent sudden death. In coronary artery disease revascularization reduces mortality in multivessel disease. In all patients with heart failure many drugs are useful in reducing total mortality and sudden death: beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, antialdosterone drugs, statins, and omega-3 fatty acids. Finally, many prospective randomized studies have demonstrated the efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in reducing mortality. However, the high cost-benefit ratio remains an unsolved problem of this therapy.", 
    "282": "Several studies have demonstrated that a prolonged over-activation of neurohormonal mechanisms contributes to drive structural and functional abnormalities of the cardiovascular system and leads to poor prognosis in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). In particular, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) leads to increased levels of angiotensin II and plasma aldosterone, and promote development of arterial vasoconstriction and remodeling, sodium retention, oxidative process, and cardiac fibrosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta-blockers may modulate this excessive over-activity and improve survival in those patients. However, high circulating and tissue levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone may persist and contribute to further progression of CHF. Many aspects of the pathophysiological role of the RAAS in CHF are still debated, and a more thorough comprehension of this fundamental system is needed. This article reviews the current knowledge on the biochemical and functional organization of the RAAS, its pathophysiological role in CHF, and the potential therapeutic implications.",

Cardiovascular diseases kill more than 950000 people only in the USA. 50% of cardiovascular mortality is due to ischemic heart disease, stroke is responsible for 20%. The annual cost of the treatment of cardiovascular illnesses takes more than 330 billion dollars. All these data underline the importance of these illnesses. The aim of cardiovascular prevention is to reduce the incidence of first or recurrent events due to ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke or peripheral artery disease, especially early deaths and disability.

The history of its management reflects growth and changes in our understanding of its pathophysiology. In the past, pharmacological treatment of heart failure was aimed only at relieving edema and improving hemodynamics. Today, however, a major aim of treatment is to antagonize the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, to avert harmful effects of neurohormonal activation on the myocardium and peripheral vessels. Currently, the major pharmacological treatments for heart failure are diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and (in NYHA classes III-IV) aldosterone antagonists. Some patients may also require specific treatment with additional drugs (e.g. anti-arrhythmia agents, anticoagulants, or vasodilators) or procedures such as coronary revascularization, or implantable devices such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or resynchronization devices. Patients with end-stage heart failure may require cardiac transplantation or ventricular assist devices.

Immunosuppression with myco-phenolate mofetil (MMF) has recently been introduced in the treatment of immune-mediated renal diseases showing promising results. Preliminary clinical reports are also suggestive that MMF is effective in severe forms of IgAN. We propose a randomised prospective trial aimed to compare long-term renal survival of early IgAN in the course of ACEI therapy with or without MMF immunosuppression.", 
    "286": "The objective was to evaluate the effect of improved metabolic control and ACE inhibition used sequentially in the treatment of type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. We studied 44 consecutive type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria not previously treated with ACE inhibitors. Improved metabolic control (optimisation period) was attempted for 6-12 months and patients with persistent microalbuminuria were subsequently treated with ACE inhibitors. Stepwise logistic regression analysis included the variables age, age at diabetes onset, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, initial albumin excretion rate (AER) and mean blood pressure as predictors of final AER. Thirty per cent of patients regressed to normoalbuminuria after the optimisation period, and 58% of them maintained normal AER 4.5+/-1.3 years later (3-7 years). Patients achieving normoalbuminuria had lower baseline AER (53+/-22 vs. 94+/-63 mg/24 h, p=0.012). The initial AER level was the only factor associated with final AER (r=0.58, p=0.021). Thirty patients with persistent microalbuminuria were treated with ACE inhibitors for two years, 35.5% of whom regressed to normal AER. Patients achieving normoalbuminuria after ACE inhibitor treatment had lower baseline AER (55+/-24 vs. 132+/-75 mg/24 h, p=0.03). The initial AER was the sole predictor of final AER (r=0.51, p<0.013). Overall, the sequential use of improved metabolic control and ACE inhibitor therapy resulted in long-term normalisation of AER in 47.4% of patients. The sequential implementation of improved metabolic control and ACE inhibitor therapy had a long-term beneficial effect in type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. We propose that type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria could benefit from a period of metabolic improvement before the initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "287": "Patients with peripheral arterial disease are at greatly elevated risk for stroke and myocardial infarction and are six times more likely to die from cardiovascular causes than those without the disease. The available evidence supports the provision of an antiplatelet agent, a statin, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for cardiovascular protection in these patients. When used together, these approaches are expected to produce a cumulative relative risk reduction of approximately 80%. Given the high baseline risk of this population and the effectiveness of these interventions, a combination of multiple drug therapies, in concert with aggressive lifestyle change and revascularization (where appropriate), can substantially reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality in patients with peripheral arterial disease.", 
    "288": "Urinary microalbumin excretion was assessed in 76 children with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in whom the presence of proteinuria, hypertension, reduced renal function, hypercalciuria, urinary tract infection or structural abnormality of the urinary tract had been excluded. All children underwent a percutaneous kidney biopsy to determine whether microalbumin excretion can be used as a marker to predict the source of hematuria. Microalbumin excretion was considered normal if the urinary ratio of microalbumin to creatinine (MA/Cr ug/mg) was < or =30. Twenty-two (29%) had microalbuminuria (MA/Cr 96+/-30 microg/mg) and 54 (71%) had normal albumin excretion (MA/Cr 13+/-2 microg/mg). Of those with normoalbuminuria, 38 (70%) had normal renal tissue, 15 (28%) thin glomerular basement membrane (TGBM) disease and 1 (2%) IgA nephropathy. In contrast, 20 (91%) of those with microalbuminuria had IgA nephropathy and 2 (9%) had TGBM disease. The mean urinary MA/Cr ratio for all IgA children was 89+/-32 microg/mg higher compared with a value for the children with TGBM disease (14 +/-3 microg/mg, P <0.001) or children whose renal biopsy appeared normal (11+/-2 microg/mg, P <0.001). Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between the mean MA/Cr ug/mg ratio for children with TGBM disease and those with normal glomerular findings. Fourteen of the 20 children with IgA nephropathy who also had microalbuminuria were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Over a mean follow-up of 51 months, none developed overt proteinuia; hematuria resolved and microalbuminuria returned to normal in eight (57%) during therapy with the ACE-inhibitor. In contrast, hematuria persisted and prtoteinuria developed in the other untreated children. None of the children with TGBM disease developed overt proteinuria after a mean of 51 months. Hematuria was persistent in children with TGBM disease, but often resolved in those whose biopsies were completely normal. These data suggest that determination of urinary microalbumin excretion is warranted in the routine examination of children with isolated microscopic hematuria. Routine screening for microalbuminuria may help to identify a subgroup of patients with IgA nephropathy who are at high risk for progressive kidney disease and need more intensive therapy and closer follow-up.",

    "296": "The patients were divided into two groups: those without and with vascular disease. In the first group, mortality at 1 year was significantly higher in those with end organ damage (5.8 versus 2.7%, P=0.005). Similarly, the mortality in patients with known vascular disease (CAD, peripheral vascular disease, ischaemic stroke) was higher in the presence of a previous vascular event (7.8 versus 5.3%, P=0.055, vascular event: non-fatal MI/stroke). The use of antiplatelets, statins, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was low and did not improve in the follow-up period. The most important predictors of cardiovascular mortality were the presence of end organ damage [odds ratio (OR) 1.65, P=0.001], pre-existing vascular disease (OR 1.49, P=0.023) and protectively, the consistent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR 0.49, P=0.001).",

    "298": "Since recent studies demonstrated an impaired outcome after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in patients with chronic renal failure but did not address the aetiology of renal failure, we now analysed the outcome of patients with diabetic nephropathy in 721 consecutive patients undergoing PCI. Diabetic nephropathy was present in 37 patients (5.1%), and diabetes alone in 126 patients (17.5%); 178 patients (24.7%) suffered from renal insufficiency of other causes; the other 380 patients (52.7%) were used as controls. Although angiographic success rates were similar in the subgroups (94-97%), 30-day and long-term mortality after 4 years was significantly higher in patients with diabetic nephropathy (8.1 and 27%, respectively) than in diabetics (1.6 and 8.7%, respectively), patients with renal insufficiency (3.9 and 16.8%, respectively), or controls (2.4 and 5.0%, respectively, each p<0.001, log-rank test).

    "299": "Meprin (MEP) A is a metalloendopeptidase that is present in the renal proximal tubule brush-border membrane (BBM) and that colocalizes with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The MEP beta-chain gene locus on chromosome 18 has been linked to a heightened risk of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in patients with type 2 diabetes. This study evaluated 1) whether MEP-alpha and MEP-beta gene and protein expression are altered in db/db mice before the onset of DN and 2) the role of MEP-alpha in the pathogenesis of DN and the impact of the renin-angiotensin system on this interaction in two experimental models of diabetes. MEP-alpha and MEP-beta gene and protein expression were evaluated in db/db mice, 13-14 wk of age, compared with lean C57BLKS/J littermate animals. A treatment study was then performed in which db/db mice and controls were assigned to one of three groups: control (C) water, no therapy; ACE inhibitor therapy, enalapril (EN)-treated water, 50 mg/l; ANG II receptor type 1 blocker (ARB) therapy, losartan (LOS)-treated water, 500 mg/l. Treatment was started at 8 wk of age and continued for 52 wk. Male Sprague-Dawley rats with diabetes for 52 wk following a single dose of streptozocin (STZ; 60 mg/kg) were also studied. At 13.5 wk of age, MEP-alpha and MEP-beta kidney mRNA abundance and protein expression were significantly lower in db/db mice compared with lean controls, with greater changes in MEP-beta (P < 0.05). In the treatment study, EN ameliorated and LOS exacerbated DN in db/db mice. BBM MEP A enzymatic activity and MEP-alpha protein content were lower in db/db mice vs. control nonobese mice at 52 wk (P < 0.02). EN-treated db/db mice showed increased MEP A activity, MEP-alpha content in BBM, decreased urinary MEP-alpha excretion, and enhanced BBM staining for MEP-alpha protein vs. C and LOS-treated db/db mice. In nonobese mice, EN and LOS treatment had no effect on MEP-alpha expression. In rats with STZ-induced diabetes for 52 wk, urinary MEP-alpha excretion was increased and MEP A activity and MEP-alpha protein content per milligram of BBM protein were decreased compared with age-matched control animals (P < 0.05). These results indicate that db/db mice manifest decreased MEP-alpha and MEP-beta gene and protein expression, before the development of overt kidney disease. Moreover, in db/db mice with DN and rats with STZ-diabetes, there was an inverse relationship between renal MEP-alpha content and the severity of the renal injury. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor was more effective than ARB in ameliorating DN in db/db mice, a change that correlated with alterations in urinary excretion and BBM content of MEP-alpha. MEP-alpha may play a role in the pathogenesis of DN and the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy on the progression of diabetic kidney disease may be related, in part, to its impact on renal MEP-alpha expression.", 
    "300": "Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a clinical state characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and eventual edema formation. Although the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not yet fully clarified, it is well accepted that nephrin and podocin are involved in the development of proteinuria. The effects of early treatment with various antiproteinuric therapies on proteinuria and glomerular staining of nephrin and podocin in rats with experimental NS have not been previously studied. Proteinuria and glomerular nephrin and podocin immunofluorescence were examined in rat kidneys with adriamycin-induced NS and the effects of antiproteinuric drug therapies during 5 wk with enalapril, losartan, alone or in combination, omapatrilat, and mycophenolate mofetil on these parameters were assessed. Injection of adriamycin caused a significant increase in daily (from 21.8 +/- 1.4 to 983.1 +/- 45.8 mg/day, P < 0.01) and cumulative protein excretion (from negligible values to 22,490 +/- 931 mg, P < 0.001) during 5 wk. Early treatment with enalapril significantly decreased the daily (641.7 +/- 82.4 mg/day, P < 0.0023) and cumulative proteinuria (15,727 +/- 2,204 mg, P < 0.001). A similar effect, although to a lesser extent, was obtained after omapatrilat treatment: cumulative proteinuria was reduced to 18,706 +/- 1,042 mg, P < 0.001. In contrast, losartan treatment did not significantly influence the cumulative proteinuria that remained comparable (20,351 +/- 1,360 mg, P > 0.05) to that observed in untreated NS rats. Unexpectedly, when losartan was given in combination with enalapril, it abolished the beneficial effects of the latter. Pretreatment with mycophenolate mofetil exerted a moderate antiproteinuric effect, which appeared only during the last week of the experimental treatment. Nephrotic rats exhibited severe disruption of slit diaphragm structure as seen by rapid and profound loss of nephrin and podocin. Beneficial effects of enalapril, omapatrilat, and mycophenolate mofetil paralleled the preservation of nephrin, as determined immunohistochemically, and enabled prediction of significant antiproteinuric responses. Enalapril alone or in combination with losartan resulted in significant preservation of podocin. Pretreatment with enalapril, and to a lesser extent omapatrilat, is superior to losartan in reducing proteinuria in NS rats. A combination of ACE inhibitors with ANG II receptor blockers does not provide any advantageous antiproteinuric therapy in these animals. Nephrin loss is an indication of proteinuria in NS and the antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors, vasopeptidase inhibitors, and mycophenolate mofetil attenuate this reduction. Not all the drugs which restore podocin reduce urinary protein in NS.",

IL-10 appeared to be the strongest independent predictor of albuminuria, followed by HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure and DN duration. There was a positive correlation between the values of IL-10 and albuminuria in DM patients with DN. The patients in the fourth quartile of albuminuria had a distinctly higher concentration of IL-10 than those in the lower quartiles.", 
    "304": "The increased concentration of IL-10 in the serum samples from DM patients with DN seems to depend on the severity of the nephropathy.

During follow-up, total re-admission rate and mean number of re-admissions were similar; however, total hospitalisation duration was greater in patients older than 75 years (38+/-77 days) than in those 75 years or younger (26+/-59 days) (P<0.01).

Consequently, it has been more difficult for clinical trials to demonstrate similar, enhanced or additive benefits of ARBs. However, ARBs were introduced with the hypothesis that they were likely a more effective method of interrupting the renin-angiotensin system and would result in enhanced outcomes. Clinical trials in high-risk vascular patients (after myocardial infarction), patients with heart failure and patients with nephropathy show the benefits of ACE inhibition. ARBs likely have similar benefits as ACEIs when used after myocardial infarction, in patients with heart failure and for management of diabetic nephropathy. However, ARBs generally remain a second-line treatment because it has been more difficult to demonstrate that ARBs prevent acute vascular events, such as myocardial infarction, together with the greater clinical trial evidence for ACE inhibition. The primary application of ACEIs over ARBs is reflected in the Canadian clinical guidelines for the management of patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart failure and following myocardial infarction. Until the completion of clinical trials, such as the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET), that examine whether ARBs have vascular protective properties similar to ACEIs, it is unlikely that the clinical guidelines will change.",

A large number of experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that chronic nephropathies share common pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to renal disease progression, even independent of the original cause. Clinical studies found a significant correlation between the extent of urinary protein excretion and the rate of GFR decline in both diabetic and nondiabetic chronic nephropathies. Randomized trials, in particular the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) study, also showed that treatments that reduce proteinuria (namely angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) are renoprotective and limit progression to ESRD. Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials also evaluated the role of proteinuria and of ACE inhibition therapy in chronic renal disease progression. Their findings were consistent with those of the REIN study and confirmed in larger series of patients the predictive value of proteinuria and the renoprotective effect of proteinuria reduction by ACE inhibition therapy. Thus, the meta-analyses may confirm and extend previous findings generated by randomized clinical trials. Conceivably, well-designed studies in properly selected and carefully monitored patients who are at increased risk continue to be the best approach to test novel hypotheses. The meta-analyses, however, represent a valuable tool to evaluate the consistency and generalizability of trial results to larger cohorts of patients.", 
    "330": "Agents that interfere with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) reduce proteinuria and afford renal protection. The combination of different measures that serve maximization of RAS blockade is thought to improve the antiproteinuric efficacy. The feasibility and the efficacy of such a combination strategy were studied in nondiabetic patients with residual proteinuria during previous RAS blockade by individual antiproteinuric titration. Previous medication was replaced by irbesartan 300 mg combined with a diuretic. Lisinopril was added in increasing doses until a maximal dose of 40 mg/d. Titration stopped when target proteinuria (< 1 g/d) was reached or further dose titration was not tolerated because of side effects. Residual proteinuria (median, 3.2 g/d; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 5.2 g/d) was significantly reduced with 55.6% (95% confidence interval, 16.0 to 73.2%; P < 0.02) on the maximal additional tolerated dose of lisinopril. The maximal dose of lisinopril was 10 mg in two of eight, 20 mg in two of eight, 30 mg in one of eight, and 40 mg in three of eight patients. At this dose, target proteinuria of < 1 g/d was reached in two of eight patients. The number of patients with adverse events during dose titration was five of eight patients: two had cough; two had hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mmol/L), one of whom had > 50% increase of serum creatinine; and one had dizziness. In conclusion, individual titration for maximal RAS blockade, entailing dose titration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on top of high-dose angiotensin II antagonists with diuretic, induces further reduction of residual proteinuria. However, this occurs at the expense of adverse events. To further improve renoprotective treatment strategies, it is important to explore other modes of antiproteinuric intervention in patients with residual proteinuria during RAS blockade.", 
    "331": "Aggressive treatment of hypertension is effective in reducing both microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes, with target BP < 130/80 mmHg being recommended. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were found to be more effective than the other traditional agents in reducing the onset of clinical proteinuria in individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and incipient nephropathy. However, small trials on patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy failed to demonstrate a specific renoprotective role for this class of drugs. The aim of the Program for Irbesartan Mortality and Morbidity Evaluation was to ascertain whether angiotensin II receptor blockers are effective in both preventing the development of clinical proteinuria and delaying the progression of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. The Irbesartan in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Microalbuminuria (IRMA) Study showed that, as compared with conventional therapy, irbesartan is better at preventing the development of clinical proteinuria and at restoring normoalbuminuria for comparable BP control in patients with incipient nephropathy. The Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial showed that irbesartan is more effective than traditional antihypertensive therapies in reducing the progression toward ESRD in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy regardless of changes in BP. Moreover, secondary analysis of the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial showed that the achieved systolic pressure as well as baseline and current proteinuria significantly predict renal outcomes. In conclusion, the results of the Program for Irbesartan Mortality and Morbidity Evaluation demonstrate that irbesartan significantly prevents the development of clinical proteinuria in individuals with microalbuminuria and delays the progression of nephropathy in individuals with proteinuria. Moreover, the renoprotective effects of irbesartan go beyond its effect on BP.", 
    "332": "The prevalence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide. There is a great need to identify therapies that arrest disease progression to end-stage renal failure. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system both by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists is probably the best therapeutic option available. Several large, multicenter studies have indeed shown a significant reduction in the risk for doubling baseline serum creatinine or progression toward end-stage renal failure in patients who do and do not have diabetes and have chronic nephropathies that are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, the number of patients who reach end-stage renal failure is still considerably high. Significant reduction of the incidence of ESRD is likely to be achieved in the near future for chronic nephropathies, provided that the degree of renoprotection can be improved. This goal may be attainable with a more complex strategy than with a single or dual pharmacologic intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Strict control of BP and protein excretion rate, lowering of blood lipids, tight glucose control for individuals with diabetes, and lifestyle changes form part of the future multimodal protocol for treatment of patients with chronic nephropathies.", 
    "333": "Type 2 diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions throughout the world, representing the most common cause of ESRD. Early identification of renal impairment associated with diabetes and initiation of renoprotective therapy are imperative. High BP, dyslipidemia, long duration of diabetes, and poor glycemic control are important risk factors; their modification, renal function monitoring, and combined therapies are the current integrated approaches to treat patients with diabetic kidney disease. Strong evidence suggests that achieving target BP goals via inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system confers significant renal protection for diabetic patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers lower BP and reduce both the progression of renal damage and adverse cardiovascular events; some important renoprotective actions seem to be independent of the antihypertensive effect. Stringent quality of glycemic control is another key point to prevent onset of nephropathy or slow its progression. Evidence from basic research and clinical trials indicates that hypolipidemic drugs, mainly statins, contribute to modulate the progression of renal damage in diabetes; their use should be considered in any patient with diabetes. Smoking cessation may slow nephropathy progression; given the additional health benefits of stopping smoking, this advice is an important part of the strategy of diabetic nephropathy treatment and prevention. In conclusion, a target-driven, long-term, intensified intervention aimed at multiple risk factors should be recommended in patients with diabetes to preserve their kidney function.",

Energy balances taking into account solvation effects computed with a continuum reaction field procedure indicated the D-isomer to be more stably bound than the L-one, conform to the experimental result. The most stably bound complex has the S(-) ligand bridging monodentately the two Zn(II) cations and one carboxylate O(-) H-bonded to the Asn193 side chain. We have validated the SIBFA energy results by performing additional SIBFA as well as quantum chemical (QC) calculations on small (88 atoms) model complexes extracted from the 104-residue complexes, which include the residues involved in inhibitor binding.

The analyses showed that 41% of the oligopeptides in the ultrafiltrate had a molecular mass lower than 3 kDa.

    "346": "Bradykinin is known to stimulate neurons in rat sympathetic ganglia and to enhance transmitter release from their axons by interfering with the autoinhibitory feedback, actions that involve protein kinase C. Here, bradykinin caused a transient increase in the release of previously incorporated [3H] noradrenaline from primary cultures of dissociated rat sympathetic neurons. When this effect was abolished by tetrodotoxin, bradykinin caused an inhibition of tritium overflow triggered by depolarizing K+ concentrations. This inhibition was additive to that caused by the alpha2-adrenergic agonist UK 14304, desensitized within 12 min, was insensitive to pertussis toxin, and was enhanced when protein kinase C was inactivated. The effect was half maximal at 4 nm and antagonized competitively by the B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril did not alter the inhibition by bradykinin. The M-type K+ channel opener retigabine attenuated the secretagogue action of bradykinin, but left its inhibitory action unaltered. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, bradykinin reduced voltage-activated Ca2+ currents in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner, and this action was additive to the inhibition by UK 14304. These results demonstrate that bradykinin inhibits noradrenaline release from rat sympathetic neurons via presynaptic B2 receptors. This effect does not involve cyclooxygenase products, M-type K+ channels, or protein kinase C, but rather an inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.", 
    "347": "Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic renal failure in westernized countries. The polymorphism in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which leads to higher than normal levels of this enzyme, is a predictor of nephropathy in patients with diabetes. As increasing the levels of ACE by approximately 50% in this polymorphism is only calculated to increase the levels of angiotensin II by < 5%, whereas the levels of bradykinin will decrease by 20%, bradykinin may be nephroprotective. In diabetic mice without bradykinin B2 receptors, the only parameter that is altered compared with the diabetic mouse, is that the nephropathy is worse. Thus, in diabetic mice without a bradykinin receptor (Bdrb2(-/-)Ins2(+/C96Y)), compared with diabetic mice (Bdrb2(+/+)/Ins2(+/C96Y)), there is a greater kidney weight, increased urinary albumin output, and glomeruli mesangial sclerosis. In addition to reducing the levels of angiotensin II, vasopeptidase inhibitors increase the level of bradykinin. A vasopeptidase inhibitor (AVE7688) has been shown to prevent nephropathy developing and to ameliorate it once it has developed in Zucker diabetic rats. The nephroprotective effects (reduced albumin secretion and reduced kidney damage) of AVE7688 in Zucker diabetic rats were partially prevented by the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant. These data establish that stimulation of bradykinin B2 receptors is a target in diabetic nephropathy.",

Adult male Wistar rats, 11-12 weeks age, weighing initially 160 to 200 g were randomly allocated into 2 groups: control group (A, n = 6) and experimental group (n = 12). Diabetic rats in experimental group were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of Streptozotocin (60 mg/kg body weight), and randomly subdivided into B group (diabetic control) and C group (diabetic rats treated with benazepril, 6 mg/kg every day). Studies were performed 8 weeks after induction of diabetes. Twenty-four h urine of every rat was collected to detect urine creatinine. Serum glucose concentration and serum creatinine were determined by collecting blood samples from the inferior vena cava. Body and kidney weight were recorded. Creatinine clearance (Ccr) and ratio of kidney weight to body weight were calculated. Plasma and renal tissue angiotensin II concentration was assayed by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The phospo-p44/42MAPK protein expression was detected by Western-blot. The results showed that benazepril had no significant effect on the blood glucose level in diabetic rats in two experimental groups. Ccr and ratio of kidney weight to body weight were increased in group B (P < 0.01) as compared with normal rats at the end of the 8th week. At the end of the 8th week, Ccr in group C was lower than that in group B (P < 0.01). The ratio of kidney weight to body weight in group C was lower than that in group B at the 8th week. There were glomeruli hypertrophy and slight or moderate mesangium proliferation in diabetic rats, while there was fragmentally proliferative mesangium in group C at the end of the 8th week. Renal tissue angiotensin II concentration was significantly increased in group B, while benazepril could significantly decrease the concentration of angiotensin II in renal tissue. The expression of the phospo-p44/42MAPK protein in group B was increased as compared with group A, while it was decreased in group C as compared with group B. P42/ 44MAPK pathway participated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Benazepril can eliminate high filtration of glomeruli, decrease proteinuria, and eliminate renal hypertrophy as well as renal destruction.

    "357": "Aldosterone is currently recognized as a risk hormone for cardiovascular disease. However, the cellular mechanism by which aldosterone acts on vasculature has not been well understood. In the present study, we investigated whether aldosterone affects angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene expression in rat endothelial cells. Cultured rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) from Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the study. ACE mRNA levels and its enzyme activities in RAECs were examined by real-time RT-PCR and enzyme assay using hippuryl-His-Leu as substrates, respectively. Aldosterone significantly increased steady-state ACE mRNA levels and its enzymatic activities. This effect was dose dependent and time dependent and abolished by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone or transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. Dexamethasone also increased steady-state ACE mRNA levels, whose effect was completely blocked by glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486, but not by spironolactone. By contrast, the aldosterone-induced ACE mRNA expression was only partially blocked by RU486. The stimulatory effect of aldosterone on ACE mRNA expression was completely blocked by a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein) and JAK2 inhibitor (AG490), partially by Src kinase inhibitor (PP2) and epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor (AG1478), but not by platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor (AG1296). Transfection of dominant-negative JAK2 construct, but not wild-type construct, significantly blocked the aldosterone-induced ACE mRNA up-regulation. Furthermore, aldosterone induced phosphorylation of JAK2, whose effect was blocked by spironolactone and actinomycin D. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that aldosterone induces ACE gene expression and its enzyme activity mainly via a mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated and JAK2-dependent pathway in rat endothelial cells. This may constitute a positive feedback loop for a local renin-angiotensin system, possibly involved in the development of aldosterone-induced endothelial dysfunction and vascular injury.",

The methods are based on the charge transfer complexation reaction of the drug with 7,7,8,8,tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and p-chloranilic acid (pCA) in polar media. The lisinopril-TCNQ and lisinopril-pCA charge transfer complexes dissociate in acetone and methanol, respectively, and yield coloured TCNQ and pCA radical anions which are measured spectrophotometrically at 743 and 525 nm. Under optimised experimental conditions, Beer's law is obeyed in the concentration range of 2-26 and 25-300 microg ml-1 with molar absorptivity of 1.432x10(4) and 1.192x10(4) l mol-1 cm-1 for TCNQ and pCA methods, respectively.

Bronchoscopy revealed numerous firm nodular projections within the trachea with distribution along the cartilaginous rings. Tracheopathia osteochondroplastica (TPO) was diagnosed. TPO is an uncommon, benign, but slowly progressive disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by endoluminal projection of cartilaginous and bony nodules arising in the submucosa of the trachea. Involvement may extend to lobar or segmental bronchi.

    "371": "Small-vessel disease or cerebral microangiopathy (CMA) is a common finding in elderly people. It is related to a variety of vascular risk factors and may finally lead to subcortical ischemic vascular dementia. Because vessel stiffness is increased, we hypothesized that slow spontaneous oscillations are reduced in cerebral hemodynamics. Accordingly, we examined spontaneous oscillations in the visual cortex of 13 patients suffering from CMA, and compared them with 14 age-matched controls. As an imaging method we applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy, because it is particularly sensitive to the microvasculature. Spontaneous low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) (0.07 to 0.12 Hz) were specifically impaired in CMA in contrast to spontaneous very-low-frequency oscillations (0.01 to 0.05 Hz), which remained unaltered. Vascular reagibility was reduced during visual stimulation. Interestingly, changes were tightly related to neuropsychological deficits, namely executive dysfunction. Vascular alterations had to be attributed mainly to the vascular risk factor arterial hypertension. Further, results suggest that the impairments might be, at least partly, reversed by medical treatment such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers. Results indicate that functional near-infrared spectroscopy may detect changes in the microvasculature due to CMA, namely an impairment of spontaneous LFOs, and of vascular reagibility. Hence, CMA accelerates microvascular changes due to aging, leading to impairments of autoregulation.",

Wall thickness increased during GH therapy (from -1.38 SD to -1.09 SD after 3 years of GH therapy), but the effect was lost shortly after GH therapy ended and thickness diminished over time (-1.50 SD at 1 year after therapy and -1.96 SD at 4 years).

    "376": "Recent studies have identified that first-line renoprotective agents that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system not only reduce BP but also can attenuate advanced glycation end product (AGE) accumulation. This study used in vitro, preclinical, and human approaches to explore the potential effects of these agents on the modulation of the receptor for AGE (RAGE). Bovine aortic endothelial cells that were exposed to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) ramiprilat in the presence of high glucose demonstrated a significant increase in soluble RAGE (sRAGE) secreted into the medium. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, ramipril treatment (ACEi) at 3 mg/L for 24 wk reduced the accumulation of skin collagen-linked carboxymethyllysine and pentosidine, as well as circulating and renal AGE. Renal gene upregulation of total RAGE (all three splice variants) was observed in ACEi-treated animals. There was a specific increase in the gene expression of the splice variant C-truncated RAGE (sRAGE). There were also increases in sRAGE protein identified within renal cells with ACEi treatment, which showed AGE-binding ability. This was associated with decreases in renal full-length RAGE protein from ACEi-treated rats. Decreases in plasma soluble RAGE that were significantly increased by ACEi treatment were also identified in diabetic rats. Similarly, there was a significant increase in plasma sRAGE in patients who had type 1 diabetes and were treated with the ACEi perindopril. Complexes between sRAGE and carboxymethyllysine were identified in human and rodent diabetic plasma. It is postulated that ACE inhibition reduces the accumulation of AGE in diabetes partly by increasing the production and secretion of sRAGE into plasma.",

An early sign of impending nephropathy is microalbuminuria, defined as urinary excretion of albumin at a rate of 28.8 mg/24 h to 288 mg/24 h. Microalbuminuria is a marker of endothelial dysfunction, vascular injury, and renal disease and CVD, and it is associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction. Oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are unifying factors mediated by the renin-angiotensin system in renal disease and CVD. Clinical trials show reduced cardiovascular risk and a reversal of microalbuminuria with the use of agents that affect the renin-angiotensin system: angiotensin-receptor blockers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "382": "Long-term type 2 diabetes can lead to numerous biological complications, such as hypertension and cardio-vascular disease. Key enzymes involved in the enzymatic breakdown of complex carbohydrates,pancreatic alpha-amylase and intestinal alpha-glucosidase, have been targeted as potential avenues for modulation of type 2 diabetes-associated post-prandial hyperglycemia through mild inhibition of their enzymatic activities so as to decrease meal-derived glucose absorption. Further, inhibition of hypertension-linked angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) was targeted as a potential approach for modulation of diabetes-linked hypertension. Water-soluble extracts of soybean optimized for phenolic content via sprouting or bioprocessing by dietary fungus (Rhizopus oligosporus, Lentinus edodes) were investigated for inhibitory activity against porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA), yeast alpha-glucosidase, and rabbit lung ACE in vitro. PPA was allowed to react with each phenolic-optimized extract and the derivatized enzyme-phytochemical mixtures obtained were characterized for residual amylase activity. Alpha-glucosidase and ACE activities were determined in the presence of each phenolic-optimized extract. All of the soybean extracts possessed marked anti-amylase activity, with extracts of R. oligosporus-bioprocessed soybean having the strongest inhibitory activity, but only slight anti-glucosidase activity. The anti-amylase activity of each extract seemed associated with extract antioxidant activity. Anti-enzyme activity was slightly associated with total soluble phenolic content per se, but seemed more associated to the length of sprouting or bioprocessing of the soybean substrate. Short-term sprouting or bioprocessing seemed to improve anti-amylase activity, while long-term sprouting or bioprocessing seemed to aid anti-glucosidase activity. While ACE activity was strongly inhibited by all of the soybean extracts (44-97%), only sprouting was found to increase this inhibition and bioprocessing of soybean with L. edodes decreased inhibitory activity of soybean extract. The results suggest that sprouting and dietary fungal bioprocessing of soybean improve the anti-diabetic potential of soybean extracts, potentially through modulation of the phenolic profile of the extract, and further suggest that enzyme inhibitory activity may be linked to phenolic antioxidant mobilization during spouting and/ or bioprocessing. The significance of food-grade, plant-based enzyme inhibitors for modulation of carbohydrate breakdown and control of glycemic index of foods in the context of preventing hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus complications such as hypertension in the long-term is hypothesized and discussed.",

The iodine formed during the titration was extracted into CCl4 and subsequently determined spectrophotometrically at 510 nm. The Beer's law was obeyed in the concentration range of 120-520 microg ml-1. Rigorous statistical analyses were performed for the validation of the proposed methods.

    "384": "A drug interaction is the quantitative or qualitative modification of the effect of a drug by the simultaneous or successive administration of a different one. Hypertensive patients, mainly the more elderly ones, frequently present concomitant diseases that require the administration of several medicines which facilitates the appearance of interactions. The lack of effectiveness of the antihypertensive treatment is a relatively frequent fact that sometimes is due to interactions of antihypertensive drugs with other treatments. It is difficult to determine the incidence of interactions, but it is related to the number of drugs administered simultaneously. Between 37 and 60% of hospital-admissions are treated with potentially dangerous drug associations and up to a 6% of fatal events are due to this circumstance. Among antihypertensive drugs, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are less affected by drug-interactions. Lipophilic beta-blockers agents may present some clinical relevant interactions, whereas calcium channel blockers, especially the non-dihydropiridinic ones, are implied in clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. Among the angiotensin receptor blockers there are differences that would have to be considered when they are used in patients who receive other drugs. Although it is impossible for the doctor to remember all the clinical relevant interactions, it is important to bear in mind their existence and the possible mechanisms of production which can help to identify them and to contribute to their prevention. The most frequent interactions related with clinical problems are the pharmacokinetic ones, mainly those related to the metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system or the presystemic clearance by means of the P-glycoprotein. Enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system may present polymorphisms that can explain the individual differences in the response to drugs or the appearance of drug-interactions.",

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators also improve survival. For patients with persistent symptoms, angiotensin-receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists have additional benefits. These treatments are now preferred to digoxin, although this drug can still be useful at an earlier stage in patients with atrial fibrillation. In some patients with persistently severe symptoms and a wide QRS on the electrocardiogram, cardiac resynchronisation therapy also reduces mortality and morbidity. The role of other markers of ventricular dys-synchrony is under investigation. There is growing evidence that left-ventricular assist devices are indicated in some patients with end-stage heart failure. Organised delivery of care also improves outcome. However, there is still no firmly evidence-based treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

    "400": "Pyroglutamyl, proline-rich oligopeptides, classically referred to as bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) are found in Bothrops jararaca venom, and are naturally occurring inhibitors of the somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The chemical and pharmacological properties of these peptides were essential for the development of captopril, the first active site directed inhibitor of ACE, currently used to treat human hypertension. ACE is a complex ectoenzyme of the vascular endothelium, possessing two catalytic sites, performing diverse specific roles. Recent advances concerning novel features of BPPs revealed that they might still contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular physiology and pathology. The molecular biology of the BPPs revealed that they are part of two distinct C-type natriuretic peptide precursors found in the venom gland and the brain of B. jararaca, each containing seven BPPs. In situ hybridization studies detected the presence of the corresponding mRNA precursor in snake brain regions correlated with neuroendocrine functions, such as the ventro-medial hypothalamus, the paraventricular nuclei, the paraventricular organ, and the subcommissural organ.

When normalised to blood pressure, a significant reduction in hypertrophy was found in ovariectomised animals receiving E2. Expression of TGF-beta(1) was increased in all three groups treated with the ACE inhibitor, with top levels in ovariectomised animals. Moreover, expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an adrenoceptor dependent gene, downstream of TGF-beta(1), was up-regulated upon ACE inhibition, except in animals which were ovariectomised and oestrogen supplemented.

This approach is a powerful mathematical tool for an optimum chromatographic multivariate calibration and elimination of fluctuations coming from instrumental and experimental conditions. This multivariate chromatographic calibration contains reduction of multivariate linear regression functions to univariate data set. The validation of model was carried out by analyzing various synthetic binary mixtures and using the standard addition technique.

The overall prescription rate and dosage were lower than the recommended levels. Hospitals with cardiac care had a significantly higher prescription rate than those without (p<0.001). Patients older than 75 years received significantly less therapy (p<0.001) and a lower dosage of RAAS antagonists (p<0.01) than younger patients. Younger patients were treated more intensively in hospitals with cardiac care (p<0.05). Patients aged >75 years were under-treated, independent of the hospital (n.s.). Multivariate analysis showed that age was the most influencing factor on survival (chi(2) 15.5, p<0.0001).

Indapamide (1 mg) was added to their existing treatment once daily for 4 weeks. The additional hypotensive effects of indapamide were evaluated by casual and home BPs, and the results were compared among the three groups of subjects classified according to their initial drug treatment classes. The morning/evening (M/E) ratio of BP reduction was calculated to assess the duration of the effect. Overall, indapamide significantly (P < 0.001) lowered morning home BP (147 +/- 12/87 +/- 9 mmHg to 135 +/- 12/81 +/- 9 mmHg), evening home BP (138 +/- 15/79 +/- 10 mmHg to 126 +/- 12/73 +/- 9 mmHg), and casual BP (145 +/- 21/86 +/- 14 mmHg to 136 +/- 17/81 +/- 13 mmHg). All groups showed significant indapamide-induced home SBP/DBP decreases, whereas only the ACEI and ARB groups, but not the CCB group, showed a home pulse pressure (PP) reduction. Evening SBP and PP decreases were significantly greater in the ARB group than in the CCB group. The mean M/E ratio with indapamide was 0.95 for SBP and 0.85 for DBP.

    "419": "More than 2.8% of the population in the USA suffer from chronic heart failure, a condition that primarily afflicts people above the age of 60 years, and results in major expenses for social and health care of affected patients, their caregivers and families. The mainstay of treatment is drug therapy, complemented by comprehensive rehabilitation, invasive procedures, palliative treatment and monitoring. While sufficient health economic evidence exists on the cost-effectiveness of certain standard drugs, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers, little or no information exists on the cost effectivty of diuretics or aldosterone antagonists. Recently, introduced treatment strategies such as ventricular assistance devices or telemonitoring have yet to be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness in terms of risk of hospitalization, life expectancy and quality of life. With respect to the aging population and the drastically increasing costs of healthcare for heart failure patients, the goal is a more conscious and cost-effective resource allocation. This can help reduce the incidence of over and under treatment, diminish side effects and consequently improve symptoms, quality of life and life expectancy in the affected population.

    "420": "The objective was to assess persistence with antihypertensive therapy (AHT) and discontinuation patterns in patients newly dispensed different antihypertensive drug classes in a natural Canadian population-based setting. Hypertensive patients initiating AHT monotherapy were included in this 3-year retrospective cohort study (N=21 326) using the Saskatchewan health-care databases. Persistence was defined as consistently refilling a new prescription for AHT within 90 days of a previous dispensing. New courses of AHT were also documented in nonpersistent patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare persistence and new courses of therapy across initial drugs. Compared to the newer angiotensin II antagonists (AIIAs), the likelihood of discontinuing therapy over the 39-month study period was significantly higher for angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors (HR=1.29; 95% CI=1.16-1.43), calcium channel blockers (HR=1.42; 95% CI=1.27-1.60), beta blockers (HR=1.62; 95% CI=1.45-1.80) and diuretics (HR=1.92; 95% CI=1.73-2.14). In the year following treatment discontinuation, between 54 and 75% of patients initiated a second course of treatment. Patients initiated on an AIIA had a significantly higher likelihood of starting a new course of therapy after a first treatment discontinuation, compared to all other agents. In conclusion, hypertensive patients initiated on an AIIA not only had greater persistence to AHT but were also more likely to initiate a new course of AHT after discontinuation than those initiating treatment with other agents. Further studies are required that relate intermittent treatment behaviours to health outcomes and costs in hypertension.",

The described method showed acceptable specificity, linearity from 0.5 to 100 ng/mL, precision (expressed as a relative standard deviation of less than 15%), accuracy, and stability. The plasma concentration-versus-time curves of eight healthy male volunteers administered a single dose of imidapril (10 mg), gave an AUC12hr of imidapril of 121.48 +/- 35.81 ng mL(-1) h, and Cmax and Tmax values of 32.59 +/- 9.76 ng/mL and 1.75 +/- 0.27 h.

    "427": "Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blockers has been shown to reduce both albuminuria and blood pressure compared to either monotherapy. The mechanisms behind these beneficial effects are not known, and we hypothesized that the effect of dual RAAS blockade may be due to a more complete suppression of circulating aldosterone. We performed a combined analysis on three randomized, double-masked, cross-over trials where 51 type 1 diabetic patients suffering from diabetic nephropathy received 8 weeks of dual RAAS blockade using an angiotensin II receptor blocker in combination with an ACE inhibitor and 8 weeks of monotherapy with the same ACE inhibitor. Albuminuria, 24 h blood pressure, GFR, and plasma aldosterone were determined at the end of each treatment period. Compared to ACE inhibition alone, dual RAAS blockade lowered blood pressure by 7/5 mm Hg from 137/76 mm Hg, decreased albuminuria by 37% from 558 mg/24 hour, and reduced plasma aldosterone by 28% from 59 pg/ml and caused a reversible decline in GFR of 4 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p < or = 0.01 for all comparisons). There was and a significant correlation between changes in 24-hour diastolic blood pressure and changes in albuminuria. Furthermore, the antialbuminuric response to dual blockade was influenced by the ACE/ID polymorphism, that is, patients carrying the D-allele had a significantly lower reduction of 31% compared to the 55% in patients with the II genotype (p = 0.021). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that ACE/ID genotypes and reduction in plasma aldosterone, diastolic blood pressure and GFR is associated with changes in albuminuria on dual blockade treatment (R2 (adjusted) = 0.57, p < 0.001). Dual RAAS blockade is a new treatment concept that may offer additional cardiovascular and renal protection in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy.

Interestingly, a viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, was down-regulated in persistently infected cells. G418-selected clones established from parent Vero E6 cells, which were transfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene, were infected with SARS-CoV, resulting in a potential cell population capable of persistence in Vero E6 cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that signaling pathways of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt were activated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Previous studies also showed that the activation of p38 MAPK by viral infection-induced apoptosis, and a weak activation of Akt was not sufficient to protect from apoptosis. In the present study, we showed that the inhibitors of JNK and PI3K/Akt inhibited the establishment of persistence, but those of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK; as an inhibitor for ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK did not. These results indicated that two signaling pathways of JNK and PI3K/Akt were important for the establishment of persistence in Vero E6 cells.",

No serologic markers exist to diagnose HIVAN, and given the broad differential diagnosis for renal failure in these patients, renal biopsy should be performed. Viral infection of renal cells plays a central role in the pathogenesis of HIVAN.

Major randomized controlled trials conducted in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with the aim of primary prevention of SCD are providing insights. Several large-scale studies have demonstrated that treatment with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and statins results not only in a reduction in all-cause mortality but specifically also in SCD. On top of this optimized pharmacological therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) further decrease the risk of overall and SCD mortality in carefully selected patient groups. The sum of these trials indicates, however, that the benefit associated with ICD therapy is most prominent in patients with chronic stable CAD. In contrast, patients early after myocardial infarction derive less benefit from ICD treatment, presumably because of a high competing risk of non-arrhythmic cardiovascular death. Optimized pharmacological therapy, together with the ICD, can substantially improve the prognosis of high-risk CAD patients.", 
    "453": "In order to elucidate the mechanism of the antihypertensive action of dried bonito (katsuobushi), we compared the effects of dried bonito extracts with those of captopril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on aorta preparations isolated from rats. Dried bonito extracts (3 x 10(-4) to 3 x 10(-3) g/ml) more potently relaxed contractions induced by norepinephrine (10(-7) M) than contractions induced by KCl (55.9 mM). Dried bonito extracts (3 x 10(-3) g/ml) slightly inhibited 10(-7) M angiotensin I-induced contractions. In contrast, captopril (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) did not affect 10(-7) M norepinephrine- or 55.9 mM KCl-induced contractions, but a higher concentration of captopril (10(-6) M) very slightly relaxed it. Captopril (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) markedly inhibited 10(-7) M angiotensin I-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that antihypertensive mechanism of action induced by dried bonito involves direct action on vascular smooth muscle in addition to ACE-inhibitory activity.", 
    "454": "The metabolic syndrome is defined as a condition characterized by a set of clinical criteria: insulin resistance, visceral obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The major risk factors leading to the epidemic of this syndrome in the United States are visceral obesity, physical inactivity, and an atherogenic diet. The available current evidence suggests that the first step in management of patients with metabolic syndrome should be focused on lifestyle modifications (eg, weight loss and physical activity). The treatment should be based on two major components: behavioral change to reduce caloric intake and an increase in physical activity. A realistic goal for weight reduction should be 7% to 10% over 6 to 12 months. The general dietary recommendations include low intake of saturated fats, trans fats and cholesterol, and diets with low glycemic index. Soy protein could be more beneficial than animal protein in weight reduction and correction of dyslipidemia. Physical activity is associated with successful weight reduction and these therapeutic lifestyle changes can reduce by half the progression to new-onset diabetes in patients with metabolic syndrome. Physical activity recommendations should include practical, regular, and moderated regimens of exercise, with a daily minimum of 30 to 60 minutes. An equal balance between aerobic exercise and strength training is advised. Medication therapy is a critical step in the management of patients with metabolic syndrome when lifestyle modifications fail to achieve the therapeutic goals. There is no single best therapy and the treatment should consist of treatment of individual component(s). Atherogenic dyslipidemia should be controlled with statins if there is concomitant increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and if indicated with combination therapy, including fibrates, nicotinic acid, bile acid-binding resins, or ezetimibe. Drugs such as thiazolidinediones and renin-angiotensin system blockers are a few of the available agents in this category. Some evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and b blockers are more beneficial for treatment of hypertension in patients with metabolic syndrome. Patients with metabolic syndrome also have elevations in fibrinogen and other coagulation factors leading to prothrombotic state and aspirin may be beneficial for primary prevention in these patients. The new developments in the treatment of metabolic syndrome with drugs, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, will broaden the horizons of the current treatment options in metabolic syndrome.", 
    "455": "Heart failure (HF) is highly prevalent in our society and its incidence is increasing in concert with the growing aged population. Experimental and clinical studies have consistently shown that HF is ameliorated by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Acknowledging that heightened activation of the RAAS contributes significantly to HF progression has led to the development of pharmacologic antagonists of RAAS components that have greatly improved both symptoms and prognosis of patients suffering from this syndrome. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent the first developed agents that block the production of angiotensin II, and have been shown to be effective across a broad spectrum of patients with HF, including those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to overt HF. Initiation of ACE inhibitors prior to the onset of symptoms in those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and as early as feasible following a myocardial infarction, has been shown to reduce mortality and the development of overt HF in several clinical trials. Clinical data also support the use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients who are allergic to, or intolerant of, ACE inhibitors. Agents that antagonize aldosterone via blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors improve clinical outcomes in patients with advanced HF or those with reduced ejection fraction and HF following an acute myocardial infarction. Maximally inhibiting the RAAS, in conjunction with other neurohormonal systems (eg, the sympathetic nervous system by b-adrenergic blockade), leads to improved clinical outcomes in HF, a highly prevalent and costly disease in our society.", 
    "456": "Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common cause of secondary hypertension, with the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system being the pathophysiologic hallmark of the disease. Renovascular hypertension, ischemic nephropathy, proteinuria, and flash pulmonary edema are the main clinical syndromes associated with RAS. The prevalence of RAS is on the rise, owing to an increasing prevalence of diabetes and atherosclerotic disease among our aging population. This rise in RAS prevalence poses major challenges for clinicians making diagnostic and treatment decisions. Although renal angioplasty is of proven benefit in fibromuscular dysplasia, randomized trials in atherosclerotic RAS have not shown any advantage for revascularization over medical therapy in terms of blood pressure control or renal function preservation. Angioplasty and surgical interventions should be reserved for patients with preserved kidney size and hemodynamically significant stenosis.", 
    "457": "Aldosterone antagonists have been available for many decades for the treatment of hypertension, but their use has been mostly limited to patients with classic primary aldosteronism or to combination products with hydrochlorothiazide to minimize risk for hypokalemia. Recently, indications for aldosterone antagonists have been expanded to include congestive heart failure and first-line treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. In addition, we have reported that spironolactone has significant antihypertensive benefit when added to existing regimens in patients with resistant hypertension. This benefit was present in patients with and without hyperaldosteronism and was additive to chronic renin-angiotensin blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone antagonist, avoids the androgen and progesterone receptor-related adverse events that sometimes occur with spironolactone, such as breast tenderness, gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and menstrual irregularities. In clinical trials, eplerenone has been shown to have antihypertensive benefit in treating mild-to-moderate hypertension similar to other widely used classes of agents. With recent demonstrations of benefit in multiple segments of the hypertensive population, aldosterone antagonists represent emerging opportunity for controlling high blood pressure.", 
    "458": "Interpretation of some recent trials in hypertension opened a debate on the clinical value of new-onset diabetes in treated hypertensive patients. It is not completely clear whether certain antihypertensive drug classes are associated with a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes when compared with other classes. Some longitudinal studies suggest that new-onset diabetes in treated hypertensive subjects carries a risk for subsequent cardiovascular disease similar to that of previously known diabetes. In a study, plasma glucose before treatment and diuretic treatment were independent predictors of new-onset diabetes in hypertensive patients, independent of confounding factors. We estimated that one cardiovascular event associated with new-onset diabetes might be prevented for every 385 to 449 patients treated with \"new,\" rather than \"old,\" antihypertensive drugs for approximately 4 years. These observations suggest that concern about the risk for new-onset diabetes should prompt a more judicious use of diuretics and beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension. These drugs should be given cautiously in subjects who are at increased risk for new-onset diabetes, owing to impaired fasting glucose or obesity. The lowest effective dose should be used, and plasma glucose should be carefully monitored.", 
    "459": "In patients with heart failure, increased wall stretch due to volume and pressure overload leads to an increase in circulating natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP and their N-terminal fragments NT-proANP and NT-proBNP). Plasma BNP levels commonly considered normal (< 20 pg/ml) are influenced by age, sex, and also by genetic factors. ANP and BNP are synthesized and released by atrial and ventricular myocytes (Figure 1). In subjects with acute dyspnea, a BNP plasma concentration of 100 pg/ml has been established as a cutoff value for the diagnosis of heart failure yielding a very high negative predictive value coupled with an acceptable positive predictive value (Figure 3). However, recent evidence suggests that much more subtle elevations of plasma BNP may also indicate an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular events and death (Figure 2). In acute heart failure, natriuretic peptides correlate with ventricular pressure and volume overload, as well as with NYHA functional class. They can, however, not reliably discriminate between heart failure due to reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved systolic function (Figure 4). Thus, elevated BNP or NT-proBNP levels always demand further clarification of heart failure etiology using echocardiography as the method of choice. As indicated by the algorithm for a BNP-based differential diagnosis of acute heart failure symptoms (Figure 5), a variety of noncardiac causes may also lead to moderate elevations of the markers (BNP plasma concentrations of 100-400 pg/ml). In addition, normal marker levels may be observed in > 20% of patients with long-term stable heart failure. Thus, increased plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides are not strictly specific for heart diseases and also lack sensitivity in the chronic compensated state. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and spironolactone have been shown to decrease BNP and NT-proBNP in parallel with clinical and hemodynamic improvement. In patients hospitalized for decompensated heart failure, predischarge plasma BNP levels reflect the risk of future death and rehospitalization (Figure 6). Although adjusting heart failure treatment to reduce plasma NT-proBNP levels may improve outcome, a general recommendation for monitoring drug therapy using this marker should not be derived from this observation. General practitioners may, in the future, use BNP or NT-proBNP as a rule-out test for heart failure and preselect patients for further diagnostic work-up on the basis of an elevated plasma level. Within the framework of the German network for heart failure the multicentric \"Handheld-BNP Study\" will clarify, whether echocardiography using low-price simple handcarried devices could be used as an alternative or, more likely, as a complementary diagnostic tool to further improve heart failure diagnosis in primary care.",

ARBs were used as second-line treatment in less than 4% of 2,544 patients who were initially treated with an antihypertensive drug other than an ARB: 2% switched to an ARB (mostly from ACE-Is) and 1% received ARBs as add-on treatment.

    "472": "A close relationship has been established between microvascular damage in brain and kidney and indices of age and hypertension (pulse pressure, aortic pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index). The mechanism of such association has not been established, nor has rationale for prevention and treatment of microvascular damage. A logical pathophysiological explanation can be offered on the basis of differential input impedance in the brain and kidney compared with other systemic vascular beds. Torrential flow and low resistance to flow in these organs exposes small arterial vessels to the high-pressure fluctuations that exist in the carotid, vertebral, and renal arteries. Such fluctuations, measurable as central pulse pressure, increase 3- to 4-fold with age. Exposure of small vessels to highly pulsatile pressure and flow explains microvascular damage and resulting renal insufficiency and intellectual deterioration, according to the mechanism established by Byrom >50 years ago. The logical approach to prevention and treatment requires reduction of central pulse pressure. Because the aorta and large arteries are not directly affected by drugs, this entails reduction of wave reflection by dilation of conduit arteries elsewhere in the body. This can be accomplished by regular exercise and by drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. The explanation given here accounts for greater and earlier vascular damage in diabetes mellitus (relative microvascular fragility) and is similar to that given for vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension caused by ventricular septal defects and other congenital vascular shunts.",

In this study, the effect of process conditions on the ACE inhibitory activity of rice dregs hydrolyzed with a trypsin was investigated systematically using response surface methodology. It was shown that the ACE inhibitory activity of rice dregs hydrolysates could be controlled by regulation of five process conditions.

After the introduction of the NSF in-hospital mortality was significantly reduced (95 patients (4.8%) v 43 (3.2%), p = 0.02). This was associated with a reduction in the development of Q wave myocardial infarction (40.6% v 33.3%, p < 0.0001) and in the incidence of left ventricular failure (15.9% v 12.3%, p = 0.003).

    "481": "Alcohol abuse markedly increases the risk of sepsis-mediated acute lung injury. In a rat model, ethanol ingestion alone (in the absence of any other stress) causes pulmonary glutathione depletion, increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction, even though the lung appears grossly normal. However, during endotoxemia, ethanol-fed rats release more activated TGF-beta1 into the alveolar space where it can exacerbate epithelial barrier dysfunction and lung edema. Ethanol ingestion activates the renin-angiotensin system, and angiotensin II is capable of inducing oxidative stress and TGF-beta1 expression. We determined that lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that decreases angiotensin II formation, limited lung glutathione depletion, and treatment with either lisinopril or losartan, a selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, normalized TGF-beta1 expression. The glutathione precursor procysteine also prevented TGF-beta1 expression, suggesting that TGF-beta1 may be induced indirectly by angiotensin II-mediated oxidative stress and glutathione depletion. Importantly, lisinopril treatment normalized barrier function in alveolar epithelial cell monolayers from ethanol-fed rats, and treatment with either lisinopril or losartan normalized alveolar epithelial barrier function in ethanol-fed rats in vivo, as reflected by lung liquid clearance of an intratracheal saline challenge, even during endotoxemia. In parallel, lisinopril treatment limited TGF-beta1 protein release into the alveolar space during endotoxemia. Together, these results suggest that angiotensin II mediates oxidative stress and the consequent TGF-beta1 expression and alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction that characterize the alcoholic lung.", 
    "482": "The absorption characteristics of temocapril were investigated using Caco-2 cells, and the esterases expressed in Caco-2 cells were identified. Temocapril was almost completely hydrolyzed to temocaprilat during transport across Caco-2 cells. Hydrolysis experiments of temocapril in Caco-2 cell 9000g supernatant (S9) and brush-border membrane vesicles showed that temocapril was mainly hydrolyzed within the cells after uptake, after which the temocaprilat formed was transported to both the apical and basolateral surfaces. In native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by detection of hydrolase activity for 1-naphthylbutyrate, Caco-2 cell S9 showed a band with high esterase activity and another band with extremely low activity. The proteins in the major and minor bands were identified as carboxylesterase-1 (hCE-1) and carboxylesterase-2 (hCE-2). The abundant expression of hCE-1 in Caco-2 cells was supported by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In the normal human small intestine, hCE-2 is abundantly present, although the human liver expresses much higher levels of hCE-1 and lower levels of hCE-2. The expression pattern of carboxylesterases in Caco-2 cells is completely different from that in human small intestine but very similar to that in human liver. Since the substrate specificity of hCE-1 differs from that of hCE-2, it is suggested that the prediction of human intestinal absorption using Caco-2 cell monolayers should be performed carefully in the case of ester- and amide-containing drugs such as prodrugs.", 
    "483": "The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of ACE inhibition on trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colonic inflammation in rats by using captopril and lisinopril. In treatment groups, the rats were treated with ACE inhibitors, captopril or lisinopril (0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneally). The drugs were given 5 min after induction of colitis and the treatment was continued for 3 days. Three days after the induction of colitis, all rats were decapitated. The distal colon was weighed and the mucosal lesions were scored at both macroscopical at microscopic levels. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and collagen content were assessed in tissue samples. Formation of reactive oxygen species in colonic samples was monitored by using chemiluminescence technique. Serum TNF-alphalevel was assessed in trunk blood. Captopril treatment was found to be beneficial in all parameters, except colonic glutathione content. On the other hand, although stimulation of lipid peroxidation and increase in serum TNF-alpha level were successfully prevented by lisinopril, the morphology of the lesions remained unchanged. In conclusion, sulphydryl and non-sulphydryl ACE inhibitors, captopril and lisinopril do not seem to be similarly effective in TNBS-induced colitis model at least at the doses tested in our study.", 
    "484": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an ancient and complex cascade of homeostatic reactions aimed at regulating primordial functions that ensure organ perfusion through the control of blood pressure and the regulation of renal-cardiac activity. However, the over-expression or lack of compensatory mechanisms of any of its components may initiate detrimental effects that potentially lead to disease, a balance that makes the RAS a sequence with a labile physiological equilibrium and with a strong harm potential. These characteristics of the RAS in general, and of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in particular, make it not only an important complex for the regulation of blood pressure and neuropeptide metabolism, but also a fascinating subject of study from a biochemical, evolutionary and genetic point of view. Pharmacological interventions that influence the RAS by inhibiting the ACE or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) have demonstrated sustained efficacy in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events and, consequently, vascular mortality in several clinical situations. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARAs) reduce blood pressure and have cardio- and vasculoprotective effects. Anti-atherosclerotic effects have also been attributed to these drugs. For these reasons, it has been hypothesised that RAS inhibitors could also reduce the recurrence of ischaemic events after myocardial revascularisation procedures, namely coronary artery by-pass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Information available on the effect of ACE inhibitors and ARAs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) previously treated with revascularisation techniques indicates a substantial reduction of mortality and infarction in these patients. However, data regarding the progression of CAD, restenosis or reocclusion of vascular conduits of the coronary circulation after myocardial revascularisation are inconsistent. In most studies, the administration of ACE inhibitors neither improved the ischaemic threshold nor reduced the need for new revascularisation procedures. On the contrary, ACE inhibitors have been associated with higher restenosis rates after PCI in some retrospective series. Conversely, a single, exploratory randomised trial demonstrated that the selective AT1R antagonist valsartan significantly reduced stent restenosis after PCI. In patients undergoing CABG, ACE inhibitors did not reduce the risk of graft degeneration or occlusion. Studies that evaluated a possible anti-atherosclerotic effect of ACE inhibitors (including some large randomised trials) have generally been negative.",

These results further enlighten the mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular beneficial effect of renin-AT system inhibition.", 
    "486": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is not an effective antianginal therapy. Experimental data suggest that broader vasopeptidase inhibition may decrease the magnitude of demand-induced myocardial ischemia. A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel study evaluated omapatrilat, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. The primary objective was to compare maximum duration of exercise at peak plasma concentrations. Exercise treadmill studies were performed in 348 patients who had chronic angina at baseline and after 4 weeks of therapy with 80 mg/day omapatrilat or placebo. Safety data were collected and reported for all patients. Treadmill exercise duration at peak was significantly prolonged in the omapatrilat group compared with the placebo group (76.6 +/- 84.2 vs 28.7 +/- 82.2 seconds difference from baseline, p <0.001). Similar statistically significant increases were seen in time to onset of level III/IV angina and time to onset of >/=0.1-mV ST-segment depression (p <0.001). The significant improvements in exercise duration and measurements of myocardial ischemia were not sustained 20 to 28 hours after dosing. Omapatrilat was generally well tolerated in this predominantly normotensive population. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5.2% in the 2 groups. Thus, omapatrilat, an investigational vasopeptidase inhibitor, is effective in prolonging exercise duration and parameters of demand-induced myocardial ischemia in patients who have chronic angina at peak concentrations. The data confirm the proof of principle that broader vasopeptidase inhibition beyond angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is required to alleviate symptoms of chronic angina.", 
    "487": "One of the categories of drugs most frequently used by the elderly, and probably the most commonly self-prescribed class of drug in this age group, is NSAIDs. However, NSAIDs are one of the primary causes of adverse drug reactions and are notorious for their gastric toxicity. They also inhibit renal function and reduce the efficacy of diuretics and ACE inhibitors, drugs that are commonly used by elderly patients. Recent studies have shown that cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 is important in renal physiology. This means that selective COX-2 inhibitors, while undoubtedly safer than NSAIDs in terms of gastric toxicity, are not devoid of renal toxicity (in addition to their now clearly established adverse effects on coronary heart disease risk). Both the gastric and renal toxicities induced by traditional NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors seem to be related to inhibition of prostaglandin, but not leukotriene, synthesis. Maintaining the correct balance between prostaglandins and leukotrienes is essential for continuing good health, but both classes of mediators also play an important role in the pathogenesis of several diseases.Recently, a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs, the lipoxygenase (LOX)/COX inhibitors, has been developed as a means of simultaneously inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes. Inhibition of leukotriene synthesis increases anti-inflammatory efficacy, particularly in rheumatic diseases, while reducing the risk of gastric damage. The LOX/COX inhibitor licofelone, which is currently in phase III trials, is the first of this new class and in the most advanced stage of development. Preliminary data with this drug seem promising, but further well designed clinical trials of this agent in the elderly will be necessary before a final evaluation is possible.",

Mean arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance, renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, glomerular hydrostatic pressure, afferent and efferent glomerular arteriolar resistances, single nephron plasma flow, single nephron glomerular filtration rate, serum creatinine concentration, 24-h urinary protein excretion, and glomerular and arteriolar injury scores were determined. HCTZ reduced mean arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance, glomerular hydrostatic pressure, and afferent and efferent glomerular arteriolar resistances (P < 0.05, at least) but slightly increased renal plasma flow and single nephron plasma flow associated with reduced serum creatinine concentration, urinary protein excretion, and arteriolar injury score compared with l-NAME/SHR control. However, the combination of enalapril and/or losartan with HCTZ markedly improved each of these functions. These results demonstrated minor benefits of HCTZ monotherapy and a marked superiority of its combination with enalapril and/or losartan over HCTZ monotherapy on renoprotection in l-NAME/SHR, thereby providing strong evidence of their clinical benefits for hypertensive patients with renal functional impairment.",

We compared the effects of chronic treatment with CGS 26303 to the selective inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and NEP during the transition from left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to congestive heart failure (CHF) in hypertensive rats. LV geometry and function were assessed in Dahl salt-sensitive rats placed on a high-salt diet from age 6 weeks (hypertensive rats) and in control rats fed a low-salt diet. The hypertensive rats were randomized into groups that received no treatment or were treated with an ACE inhibitor (temocapril), an ECE/NEP inhibitor (CGS 26303), or a NEP inhibitor (CGS 24592) from the LVH stage (11 weeks) to the CHF stage (17 weeks). All treatments decreased the systolic blood pressure equally and significantly improved LV fractional shortening. Both temocapril and CGS 26303 ameliorated LV perivascular fibrosis, reduced mRNA levels of types I and III collagen, and decreased the heart weight/body weight ratio. CHF rats had increased plasma ET-1 levels compared with control rats. Only CGS 26303 reduced ET-1 to normal levels. ET-1 levels were found to correlate with heart/body weight, right ventricle/body weight and perivascular fibrosis ratios. During the transition to CHF, CGS 26303 produces effects that are comparable to temocapril and superior to CGS 24592. The beneficial effects of CGS 26303 are likely caused in part by the greater reduction of plasma ET-1. Dual ECE/NEP inhibitor may provide a new strategy for the treatment of human heart failure.",

The effect of ramipril on large-artery stiffness in patients with peripheral arterial disease was examined. In addition, we determined the effect of ramiprilat on extracellular matrix from human aortic smooth muscle cell culture. Forty patients with peripheral arterial disease were randomized to receive ramipril, 10 mg once daily or placebo for 24 weeks. Arterial stiffness was assessed globally via systemic arterial compliance and augmentation index (carotid tonometry and Doppler velocimetry), and regionally via carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition increased arterial compliance by 0.10+/-0.02 mL/mm Hg, (P<0.001, all probability values relative to placebo) and reduced pulse wave velocity by 1.7+/-0.2 m/s (P<0.001), augmentation index by 4.1+/-0.3% (P<0.001), and systolic blood pressure by 5+/-1 mm Hg (P<0.001). Ramipril did not reduce mean arterial pressure significantly compared with placebo (P=0.59). In cell culture, ramiprilat decreased collagen deposition by >50% and increased elastin and fibrillin-1 deposition by >3- and 4-fold respectively (histochemistry and immunohistochemistry). Fibrillin-1 gene expression was increased 5-fold (real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). Ramiprilat also reduced gene and protein (Western) expression of both matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-3. In conclusion, ramipril promoted an elastogenic matrix profile that may contribute to the observed clinical reduction in large-artery stiffness and carotid pressure augmentation, which occurred independently of mean arterial blood pressure reduction in patients with peripheral arterial disease.",

We previously reported that in all drug groups combined the BP intervention had similar effects on the primary outcome of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) slope or the main secondary clinical composite outcome of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), death, or GFR decline by 50% or 25 mL/min per 1.73 m2. This report examines the effect of the BP intervention separately in the 3 drug groups. The BP effect was similar among the drug groups for either GFR slope or the main clinical composite. However, the BP effect differed significantly among the drug groups for the composite of ESRD or death (P=0.035) and ESRD alone (P=0.021). Higher event rates for amlodipine patients assigned to the usual BP goal (0.087 per patient-year for ESRD or death and 0.064 per patient-year for ESRD) were seen compared with the remaining groups of the factorial design (range, 0.041 to 0.050 for ESRD or death; and range, 0.027 to 0.036 for ESRD). The low BP goal was associated with reduced risk of ESRD or death (risk reduction 51%; 95% confidence interval, 13% to 73%) and ESRD (54%; 8% to 77%) for amlodipine patients, but not for patients assigned to the other drug groups.

The present study was conducted to examine whether spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, alone or in combination with cilazapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ameliorates proteinuria and renal lesions in an immune-initiated progressive nephritis model. Wistar rats were uninephrectomized 7 days before injection of anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibody 1-22-3 to induce progressive glomerulonephritis. The nephritic rats were untreated or treated with spironolactone (400 mg/kg body weight/day), cilazapril (1 mg/kg body weight/day), or both for 10 weeks. Proteinuria was increased in the untreated rats 1 week after nephritis induction and was maintained throughout the experiment. Compared with the untreated animals (212.9+/-49.2 mg/day), proteinuria was significantly reduced in the spironolactone-treated group (62.0+/-4.0 mg/day, p=0.0046) and the cilazapril-treated group (71.8+/-26.0 mg/day, p=0.0048) on day 70 after antibody injection. Further reduction of proteinuria (42.4+/-4.5 mg/day, p=0.0019 vs. the untreated group) and less renal cortex interstitial fibrotic change (fibrosis score: 142.0+/-18.4 vs. 80.3+/-18.5 in the untreated group, p=0.0123) were detected in the spironolactone plus cilazapril-treated group. Blood pressure did not differ among the three treatment groups. In conclusion, spironolactone ameliorates proteinuria to the same degree as cilazapril, and concomitant use of spironolactone and an ACE inhibitor further suppresses renal disease progression. These data suggest that concomitant treatment with spironolactone and an ACE inhibitor has beneficial effects on immune-initiated progressive kidney disease.", 
    "558": "This study investigates the ability of low doses of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, in combination with angiotensin II receptor blockers, to exert antiproteinuric effects in normotensive and proteinuric outpatients with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy confirmed by biopsy. We performed a prospective, randomized, 6-month study of the effects of temocapril 1 mg (n=10), losartan 12.5 mg (n=10), and both (n=11) on mild-to-moderate proteinuria 0.76+/-0.35 g/day (range, 0.4 to 1.6 g/day) and renal function. The study subjects comprised 31 normotensive and proteinuric outpatients with IgA nephropathy accompanied by normal, or mild-to-moderately reduced but stable renal function (glomerular filtration rate>50 ml/min) without steroid or immunosuppressive therapy. We prospectively evaluated blood pressure, proteinuria, renal function and biochemical parameters before and after 6 months of therapy. The combination therapy significantly reduced proteinuria (63.2%) compared with either temocapril or losartan alone (41.3% and 36.6%, respectively, p=0.04 and 0.01, respectively). Blood pressure was most decreased in the group that received combination therapy. The reduced proteinuria did not correlate with reduced systolic or diastolic blood pressure or mean arterial pressure in any of the groups. The glomerular filtration rate fell during the first 3 months of combined therapy, but became reversible after a further 3 months of therapy. The combination significantly decreased angiotensin II (p <0.01), and this decrease was greater than that by either drug alone. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the combined therapy may have been at least partly due to the greater inhibition of the action of angiotensin II in patients with IgA nephropathy. This strategy apparently reduced mild-to-moderate proteinuria in patients with normotensive IgA nephropathy.", 
    "559": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 is a newly described enzyme with antagonistic effects to those of the classical ACE (ACE-1). Both ANG II and aldosterone play an important role in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF) and in the adverse cardiac remodeling during its development. In this study, we examined the effects of experimental CHF induced by an aortocaval fistula (ACF) and of its treatment with ANG II and aldosterone inhibitors on the relative levels of ACE-1 and ACE-2. We also compared the effects of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, and eprosartan, an ANG II receptor antagonist, on heart hypertrophy and fibrosis in rats with ACF. Spironolactone (15 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) ip, via minipump) or eprosartan (5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) ip, via minipump) was administered into rats with ACF for 14 and 28 days. Specific antibodies were used to determine the protein levels of myocardial ACE-1 and ACE-2. ACF increased the cardiac levels of ACE-1 and decreased those of ACE-2. Heart-to-body weight ratio significantly increased from 0.30 +/- 0.004% in sham-operated controls to 0.50 +/- 0.018% and 0.56 +/- 0.044% (P < 0.001) in rats with ACF, 2 and 4 wk after surgery, respectively, in association with increased plasma levels of aldosterone. The area occupied by collagen increased from 2.33 +/- 0.27% to 6.85 +/- 0.65% and 8.03 +/- 0.93% (P < 0.01), 2 and 4 wk after ACF, respectively. Both spironolactone and eprosartan decreased cardiac mass and collagen content and reversed the shift in ACE isoforms. ACF alters the ratio between ACE isoforms in a manner that increases local ANG II and aldosterone levels. Early treatment with both ANG II and aldosterone antagonists is effective in reducing this effect. Thus ACE isoform shift may represent an important component of the development of cardiac remodeling in response to hemodynamic overload, and its correction may contribute to the beneficial therapeutic effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors.",

Despite compelling scientific evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, b-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists reduce hospitalizations and mortality in HF patients, these life-prolonging therapies continue to be underutilized. Recently, device therapy for HF, including implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization devices, has also been demonstrated to result in substantial mortality reduction. A number of studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of HF patients are not receiving treatment with these guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapies when guided by conventional care. Treatment gaps in providing other components of HF patient care, including patient education, have also been documented. The demonstration that initiation of cardiovascular protective medications before hospital discharge results in a marked increase in treatment rates, improved long-term patient compliance, and better clinical outcomes has led to the revision of national guidelines to endorse this approach as the standard of care. Recent studies demonstrated that hospital-based systems can improve medical care and education of hospitalized HF patients and accelerate use of evidence-based, guideline-recommended therapies by administering them before hospital discharge. HF disease management programs have also been shown to improve HF treatment, resulting in substantial reduction in hospitalizations and mortality. Further efforts are needed to ensure the implementation of effective strategies and systems that increase the use of evidence-based therapies in the hospital and outpatient settings to reduce the substantial HF morbidity and mortality risk.",

However, data now demonstrate that compliance with these evidence-based strategies is well below acceptable thresholds, negatively affecting quality of care.

This article reviews 3 recent clinical trials that have added to our knowledge of the use of these agents. Two of the studies-EPHESUS and COMET-demonstrated significant reduction in all-cause mortality, whereas the third-CHARM-showed a marginal reduction.

Captopril was detrimental to adult formation and oviposition, and in female moths it elicited decreasing ecdysteroid levels, but increasing trypsin activities. Our results suggest that captopril downregulates oviposition by two independent pathways.

NO produced in endothelial cells plays a crucial role in vascular functions. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of diabetes on aortic NO synthesis in a model of genetic hypertension and determine whether captopril modulates this effect. Diabetes was induced in ten weeks old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by streptozotocin injection. The rats were allocated into 3 groups: control group 1, non-diabetic SHR; group 2, diabetic SHR; group 3, diabetic SHR group receiving captopril at 80 mg/kg in drinking water for 4 weeks. Mean blood pressure (MBP) was measured once a week by tail-cuff method. Aortic NO metabolities (nitrite/nitrate) and endothelial NOS (NOS-3) were assayed by Griess reaction and by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. There was a significant decrease in nitrite/nitrate (NOx) in aortas of diabetic SHR compared with controls. The decrease of aortic NOx in diabetic SHR was accompanied by a decrease in NOS-3 expression. Captopril treatment reduced MBP without affecting either NOx level or NOS-3 expression in aortas of diabetic SHR. We conclude that STZ-induced diabetes decreased NO in aortas of SHR that may reflect endothelial cell dysfunction; captopril administration decreased MBP without affecting NO level in aortas of diabetic SHR which suggest that the blood pressure-lowering effects of captopril were independent of NO.",

Despite the advances of the treatment of congestive heart failure, nearly half of the patients diagnosed with this disease five years ago are alive today. Experimental and human studies have demonstrated, that under special pathologic condition, the heart extracts aldosterone, and aldosterone extraction in the heart stimulates increased collagen turnover culminating in ventricular remodeling. Aldosterone blockade has been shown to be effective in reducing total mortality and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction due to chronic heart failure (RALES study with spironolactone) and in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction post acute myocardial infarction (EPHESUS study with eplerenone). These clinical studies have shown that mineralocorticoid receptor activation remains important despite the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocking agent and a beta blocker. In the ACC/AHA (and in the European and Hungarian) guidelines for the evolution and management of chronic heart failure, the indication of spironolactone was defined of Class Ila, Level of Evidence: B in CHF of stage C. The eplerenone (in US: INSPRA) was approved for the management of CHF patients after myocardial infarction with ejection fraction < 40%. Eplerenone, compared with spironolactone, is associated with a lower incidence of gynecomastia and other sex hormone-related adverse effect (breast pain, menstrual abnormalities). The spironolactone should not be used in patients with a creatinine above 220 mikromol/l. Despite the guidelines recommendation, spironolactone has been widely used in patients without consideration of their functional class or ejection fraction, without optimization of background treatment with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.",

Renography suggested a complication of severe right renal artery stenosis, and renal angiography revealed bilateral renal artery stenoses. Her renal hemodynamics were assessed by (99m)Tc-Mercaptoacetyltriglycine ((99m)Tc-MAG(3))-renography before and after withdrawal of temocapril. The authors concluded the patient had essential hypertension complicated by atherosclerotic renovascular disease.

It is assumed that before DM2 develops, patients undergo a stadium of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or they have impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG). The confirmed IFG or IGT represent strong predictors of DM2 manifestation and at the same time they are related with high cardiovascular risk, namely with IGT. Other significant risk factor (RF) of DM2 is the obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent clinical studies have shown that some metabolic abnormalities, which precede development of DM2 can be positively influenced by the lifestyle changes, including improvement of the diet and increasing the physical activity. Such measures can prevent or at least to delay the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus the development of cardiovascular diseases. Positive effect has also the administration of some drugs, already tested in clinical studies, namely glitasons, metromin, inhibitor of ACE, sartans and other.", 
    "579": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for up to 50% of deaths in patients with heart failure (HF), depending on severity of symptomatic impairment and left ventricular dysfunction. Neurohormonal therapy directed at the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may reduce the propensity to SCD through improved hemodynamic responsiveness, reduced sympathetic tone in the myocardium and inhibition of cardiac remodelling. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce overall mortality in chronic HF, the greatest benefit appearing to arises from reduction of HF progression rather than SCD. In HF patients who experience myocardial infarction (MI) reduced incidence in SCD may make a more marked contribution to the mortality benefits of ACE inhibition. Addition of beta-blocker therapy to ACE inhibition has consistently resulted in a reduction in SCD in patients with either mild-to-moderate or severe HF, and in the presence or absence of MI; the reduction in SCD is of the order of one-third versus placebo. Aldosterone blockade reduces the risk of SCD in advanced chronic heart failure (when added to ACE inhibitor) and in HF associated with acute MI (when given in addition to both ACE inhibitor and beta blocker). The evidence base suggests that for maximal SCD risk reduction in HF, beta-blocker therapy is advisable in combination with standard ACE inhibitor therapy, with addition of aldosterone blockade to this regimen for particular groups of heart failure patients.",

There is, however, evidence to show that hypertension is not always an asymptomatic condition; therefore, the reduction of blood pressure makes people not previously knowledgeable of their hypertensive state feel better. Labeling a patient hypertensive may have negative quality-of-life consequences. Clinicians need to be well informed regarding side-effect profiles as well as anxiety conditions that may lead to subjective complaints that are blamed on medication. Additionally, medication information given to patients may have an important effect on adverse effect reporting. Specific intolerance profiles to the thiazides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers are discussed in this review.

In the extractions, the ratio of uronic acid per total sugar was constantly about 0.3. A comparison of these extracts, soybean milk, extraction from defatted soybean meal, and soybean milk residues was also carried out, and the characteristics and the localization were investigated. Mid-sized proteins in soybean milk were easy to extract. However, hardly any high molecular weight proteins or high molecular weight carbohydrates were extracted. The proteins and carbohydrates were considered to be localized in the middle lamella and in the protein and/or oil bodies of the cell, and the proteins and carbohydrates were gradually extracted through seed and cell breaking. Gelation was observed only in the boiled extracts from whole seeds.

    "587": "The introduction of Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in 1995 was another milestone in the pharmacological management of hypertension. Due to the manifold effects on several target organs Angiotensin II is one of the most important mediator in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The blockade of the Angiotensin II receptor type 1 is a crucial cornerstone in interrupting the pathophysiological pathways in hypertension. Furthermore ARB have an excellent tolerability comparable with placebo. In the last decade large placebo-controlled trials could prove the efficiency of ARB in terms of morbidity and mortality. Patients after acute myocardial infarction and patients with chronic heart failure benefit from treatment with ARB equally compared to treatment with ACE inhibitors. Combining ARB and ACE inhibitors in patient after myocardial infarction increases the rate of adverse events without improving survival. Increase of microalbuminuria and worsening of diabetic nephropathy is reduced by ARB in patients with diabetes type 2, but an advantage over ACE inhibitors could not be documented. Hypertensive patients with electrocardiographically left ventricular hypertrophy treated with ARB seem to have an additional benefit in terms of morbidity and mortality compared to treatment with beta-blockers. In the early treatment of stroke patients treated with ARB have a lower 12-mounth mortality than patients receiving placebo. In conclusion, Angiotensin II receptor blockers are due to their well proved efficiency, the cardio- and renoprotective qualities and the excellent tolerability profile a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with hypertension.", 
    "588": "Somatic ACE (EC 3.4.15.1), a Zn(II) metalloproteinase, is composed of functionally active N and C domains resulting from tandem gene duplication. Despite the high degree of sequence similarity between the two domains, they differ in substrate and inhibitor specificity and in their activation by chloride ions. Because of the critical role of ACE in cardiovascular and renal diseases, both domains are attractive targets for drug design. Putative structural models have been generated for the interactions of ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, captoril, enalaprilat, keto-ACE, ramiprilat, quinaprilat, peridoprilat, fosinoprilat, and RXP 407) with both the ACE_C and the ACE_N domains. Inhibitor-domain selectivity was interpreted in terms of residue alterations observed in the four subsites of the binding grooves of the ACE_C/ACE_N domains (S1: V516/N494, V518/T496, S2: F391/Y369, E403/R381, S1': D377/Q355, E162/D140, V379/S357, V380/T358, and S2': D463/E431, T282/S260). The interactions governing the ligand-receptor recognition process in the ACE_C domain are: a salt bridge between D377, E162, and the NH(2) group (P1' position), a hydrogen bond of the inhibitor with Q281, the presence of bulky hydrophobic groups in the P1 and P2' sites, and a stacking interaction of F391 with a benzyl group in the P2 position. In ACE_N these interactions are: hydrogen bonds of the inhibitor with E431, Y369, and R381, and a salt bridge between the carboxy group in the P2 position of the inhibitor and R500. The calculated complexes were evaluated for their consistency with structure-activity relationships and site-directed mutagenesis data. A comparison between the calculated interaction free energies and the experimentally observed biological activities was also made. Pharmacophore refinement was achieved at an atomic level, and might provide an improved basis for structure-based rational design of second-generation, domain-selective inhibitors.", 
    "589": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and ACE-inhibitors are widely used in several clinical conditions, including hypertension and heart failure. Recently, a homologue of ACE, ACE(2) has been discovered. Both ACE and ACE(2) are emerging as key enzymes of the RAS, where ACE(2) may play a role as negative regulator of ACE. Moreover, ACE(2) appears to be an important enzyme outside the classical RAS, as it hydrolyzes apelins, dynorphin A 1-13, des-Arg-bradykinin and other peptide substrates. The precise interplay between tissue ACE, ACE(2), and their substrates and by-products are presently still unclear.ACE-inhibitors reduce angiotensin II formation and bradykinin degradation, but do not inhibit ACE(2) activity. Moreover, ACE-inhibitors differ in their affinity for tissue ACE, and it has been suggested that tissue ACE affinity might be responsible for some of the beneficial properties of these drugs. ACE-inhibitors also increase nitric oxide availability, and activate several kinases that may regulate protein synthesis by interacting with the nucleus of the cells (outside-in signaling). The outside-in signaling may also be activated by bradykinin itself. Although, the precise significance of the outside-in signaling is still unclear, this new role of ACE-inhibitors may represent a discriminant factor versus angiotensin II receptors antagonists. This mini review will summarize some new aspects concerning the recently discovered biological functions of RAS and in particular of ACE, ACE(2) and ACE-inhibitors in cardiovascular system.",

Fifty patients with type 2 diabetes were given simvastatin 20 mg and placebo, simvastatin 20 mg and ramipril 10 mg, or ramipril 10 mg and placebo daily during each 2-month treatment period. Ramipril alone or combined therapy significantly reduced blood pressure when compared with simvastatin alone. When compared with ramipril alone, simvastatin alone or combined therapy significantly improved the lipoprotein profile. All 3 treatment arms significantly improved flow-mediated dilator response to hyperemia and reduced plasma levels of malondialdehyde relative to baseline measurements. However, these parameters were changed to a greater extent with combined therapy when compared with simvastatin or ramipril alone (P<0.001 by ANOVA). When compared with simvastatin or ramipril alone, combined therapy significantly reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (P=0.004 by ANOVA). Interestingly, combined therapy or ramipril alone significantly increased plasma adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity relative to baseline measurements. These changes were significantly greater than in the group treated with simvastatin alone (P<0.015 by ANOVA).

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk of death from coronary artery disease (CAD). The metabolic milieu that results from renal dysfunction appears to accelerate the atherosclerotic process by decades in patients with ESRD. The extremely high prevalence of atherosclerosis in patients with ESRD mandates risk factor identification and treatment. Traditionally, CAD in this patient population has been treated conservatively. Analysis of large databases has highlighted the scope and complexity of this problem; nonetheless, there is a paucity of randomized, controlled trials of CAD in patients with ESRD. In this paper the following issues related to evaluation and treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease are addressed: (1) optimal CAD risk management; (2) evaluation for CAD in patients with ESRD, including the identification of coronary calcification; (3) treatment of CAD with medical therapy and revascularization; (4) relative merits of percutaneous coronary intervention versus bypass surgery. In general, an aggressive approach to medical management of CAD is warranted, even in the setting of subclinical CAD. A low threshold for diagnostic testing should be employed in patients with ESRD. When significant CAD is identified, ESRD patients appear to benefit more from revascularization compared to conservative medical management. Thus, if clinically reasonable, patients with ESRD and CAD should be managed aggressively to improve survival and reduce the incidence of future cardiac events.",

Methods and Results We compared survival and hospital admission rates in 2 cohorts enrolled in a national registry of outpatients with HF secondary to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction referred to cardiology centers in 1995 (n = 712) and 1999 (n = 603). One year after enrollment, 163 of 1315 patients (12%) were dead. Survival rates were 85% in the 1995 versus 91% in the 1999 cohort. Older age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV, anemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, and a lower LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were associated to an increased risk of all-cause mortality by multivariate analysis. Furthermore a significant independent cohort effect was observed: the adjusted risk of death was 1.30 (95% CI 1.16-1.45) for the 1995 versus 1999 cohort (survival difference adjusted P = .0067). The proportion of patients admitted to hospital declined significantly in 1999 versus 1995, for all causes (20% versus 27%, P = .006), for cardiac causes (16% versus 22%, P = .002), and for worsening congestive heart failure (8% versus 15%, P = .0005). Survival free from HF admission was 69% in 1995 versus 84% in 1999 (adjusted P = .0001); NYHA class III-IV, hypotension, diuretics and a lower LVEF were associated to an increased risk of this combined end point by multivariate analysis, as well as the enrollment year (relative risk 1.38, 95% CI 1.22-1.56, P = .0039). Conclusion In a national cardiologic registry of outpatients with systolic HF, survival improved and hospital admissions decreased over a 4-year period.

Although Dcp had been assigned to the angiotensin I-converting enzymes (ACE) due to blockage by typical ACE inhibitors, it is currently grouped into the M3 family of mono zinc peptidases, which also contains the endopeptidases neurolysin and thimet oligopeptidase (TOP). We have cloned, expressed, purified, and crystallized Dcp in the presence of an octapeptide \"inhibitor\", and have determined its 2.0A crystal structure using MAD methods. The analysis revealed that Dcp consists of two half shell-like subdomains, which enclose an almost closed two-chamber cavity. In this cavity, two dipeptide products presumably generated by Dcp cleavage of the octapeptide bind to the thermolysin-like active site fixed to side-chains, which are provided by both subdomains. In particular, an Arg side-chain backed by a Glu residue, together with two Tyr phenolic groups provide a charged anchor for fixing the C-terminal carboxylate group of the P2' residue of a bound substrate, explaining the strict dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase specificity of Dcp. Tetrapeptidic substrates are fixed only via their main-chain functions from P2 to P2', suggesting a broad residue specificity for Dcp. Both subdomains exhibit very similar chain folds as the equivalent but abducted subdomains of neurolysin and TOP. Therefore, this \"product-bound\" Dcp structure seems to represent the inhibitor/substrate-bound \"closed\" form of the M3 peptidases, generated from the free \"open\" substrate-accessible form by a hinge-bending mechanism. A similar mechanism has recently been demonstrated experimentally for ACE2.", 
    "647": "It is noteworthy that drugs having a significant impact in preventing arrhythmias (atrial or ventricular) are those with no direct specific antiarrhythmic electrophysiologic properties. Specifically, drugs able to interfere with the renin-angiotensin system and the n-3 fatty acids seem to play a relevant role as antiarrhythmics, even if they do not act in the typical manner. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with decreased left ventricular function. The main reduction is linked to a decrease of ventricular arrhythmias, while several studies have suggested that ACE-inhibitors may also decrease the burden of atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, many of angiotensin receptor blockers and spironolactone have been shown to have antiarrhythmic properties. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to be antiarrhythmic as well. Their effects on the fast voltage-dependent sodium current I(NA), inhibition of I(Ca2+) and the K+ channel modulation explain their antiarrhythmic properties. For these reasons the renin-angiotensin system blockade and the n-3 PUFA intake may provide simple and safe protection from cardiac arrhythmias.",

All of the patients underwent three renographies (baseline, captopril renography and early losartan renography). Early losartan renography was performed at 1 h after oral losartan administration in both groups. In group B, seven patients underwent additional losartan renography (late losartan) performed 3 h after oral losartan administration; these patients composed group B1.",

    "652": "Patients who present with an impaired left ventricular (LV) function of nonischemic origin (EF < or = 35%), should first undergo intensified heart failure therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics. If the impairment of LV function persists for 3-9 months despite adequate therapy, the implantation of a defibrillator (ICD) seems to be reasonable for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in these patients. If patients present with non-sustained ventricular tachycardias, ICD implantation and treatment with amiodarone are probably equally effective and better than mere heart failure therapy. In patients presenting with an indication for biventricular pacing, a biventricular ICD should be used.", 
    "653": "Angiotensin-II, a product of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) action, regulates vascular tone, stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activates NFkappaB, increases oxidant stress, and suppresses nitric oxide synthesis. Thus, angiotensin-II is pro-inflammatory in nature. Hence, increase in ACE activity and the concentrations of angiotensin-II initiate and perpetuate inflammation. Since ACE is present in many tissues including: the uterus, placenta, vascular tissue, heart, brain, adrenal cortex and kidney, leukocytes, alveolar macrophages, peripheral monocytes, neuronal cells and epididymal cells, this suggests that angiotensin-II may have a role in atherosclerosis, congestive cardiac failure, stroke, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, psoriasis, atopic and non-atopic dermatitis, eczema, several acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, and cancer, conditions in which inflammation is known to play a significant role. This suggests that ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin-II receptor blockers could be of significant benefit in the management of these conditions. Alternatively, structural analogues of presently available ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers could be developed such that they are not only useful in the treatment of hypertension and CHF but also possess anti-inflammatory actions.",

In 2006, prescription drug plan sponsors, including health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, and other entities, will be required to offer MTMP services performed by pharmacists or other health professionals. The Pharmacist Review to Increase Cost Effectiveness (PRICE) Clinic in Sacramento, California, is a pharmacist-directed, multidisciplinary model that is adaptable to providing MTMP services in a managed care setting. The PRICE Clinic serves a 3-fold mission: (1) to help low-income elderly patients decrease out-of-pocket (OOP) drug expenses; (2) to ensure that patients receive clinically appropriate, cost-effective drug regimens; and (3) to improve access to needed medications. The objectives of this study were to characterize and document the number and type of PRICE clinic interventions; measure changes in generic drug use; document savings in OOP drug costs; and measure patient access to drugs that had been, or would have been, discontinued because of cost.",

Study participants were low-income elderly with multiple chronic diseases, multiple medications, and high drug costs. For each patient, researchers documented the number and type of interventions performed by pharmacists and the drug class involved in each intervention. Changes in generic drug use and OOP costs were assessed by a preanalysis and postanalysis of selected outcome variables and a comparison of results with comparable patient populations in large state and national databases. Self-report was used to examine whether patients had discontinued medications because of cost, and the PRICE Clinic database analysis examined whether interventions enabled patients to resume previously discontinued medications.",

The most common drug classes involved in interventions were lipid-lowering drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and asthma and allergy drugs. Generic drug use increased from 51% before PRICE clinic interventions to 56% afterward, a relative increase of 9.8% and more than 30% higher relative to the benchmark value. OOP medication expenditures decreased 68%, from dollar 185 to dollar 60 per patient per month, or dollar 1,500 per patient per year. A total of 215 patients (41%) reported that they had or would soon discontinue drugs because of cost; 186 (87%) of these patients were able to continue or resume the drug as the result of PRICE Clinic interventions.

The assessment of cardiovascular survival and renal survival at the end of follow-up revealed 46 cardiovascular deaths, 20 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 41 patients with an increase in serum creatinine of over one-third. The multivariate analysis showed that renal revascularization did not affect mortality or renal survival compared with medical treatment. Revascularization produced slightly lower increases in serum creatinine and a better control of blood pressure. A longer survival was associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (P = 0.002) in both revascularized and medically treated patients. The only significant predictor of ESRD was an abnormal baseline serum creatinine.",

It has been demonstrated previously that intrarenal ANG II is augmented by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) dependent mechanism in the non-ischemic kidney, but the role of ACE-independent production of ANG II in the kidney by the enzyme chymase is unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that intrarenal chymase activity is up-regulated in RVH.",

ANG II production was quantified in kidney homogenates by incubating at 37 degrees C for 60 min with enzyme substrate (200 microm ANG I) alone or substrate containing the chymase inhibitor chymostatin. ANG II was separated and quantitated by HPLC. Chymase activity was defined as the fraction of ANG II production inhibited by Chymostatin.",

Estimated amounts of supplied lisinopril were 6.5 and 0.65 mg/kg/day in groups. On post-operative 8th day, relaparotomy was performed and anastomosis-bursting pressures were measured. Then blood and tissue samples were taken for serum transforming growth factor beta-1 and tissue hydroxyproline measurements and histopathological examinations.",

Furthermore, initiating ACE-I in patients already using a diuretic or stable on their current medication was perceived as barrier. Titrating the ACE-I dose was seen as difficult by more than half of the GPs. No significant relationships could be found between the barriers perceived and actual ACE-I prescribing. Regarding ACE-I dosing, the few GPs who did not agree that the ACE-I should be as high as possible prescribed higher ACE-I doses.",

Although the metabolic syndrome seems to have multiple aetiological factors, microvascular dysfunction is a potential explanation for the above-mentioned cluster of multiple metabolic risk factors such as hypertension, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Microvascular dysfunction leads not only to increased peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure, but may also decrease the insulin-mediated glucose uptake in muscles. The different effect on the microcirculation may explain why some antihypertensive drugs (beta-blockers) lead to an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, whereas others (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors) are associated with a decrease of that risk.",

Whereas the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the inflammatory process has been documented in more detail during the last few years, the impact of an ACE-inhibitor therapy on this process has not been fully understood so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril on hs-CRP plasma concentrations in patients with atherosclerosis.",

Ten patients, pretreated with statins, and 10 patients not previously treated with statins were eligible for statistical analysis. Baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was significantly decreased from 3.99+/-1.61 mg/l (mean+/-SD) to 2.72+/-1.19 mg/l (-32%) after 3 months treatment with 10 mg ramipril daily (p=0.0002). The decrease was more pronounced in patients who had not been treated with statins previously (-1.50 mg/l+/-1.44 mg/l) compared to those who were pretreated (-0.90 mg/l+/-0.93 mg/l).",

This effect may contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction mediated by ramipril aside from the blood pressure lowering effect.", 
    "683": "Hypertension commonly occurs as part of a genetically complex disorder of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism known as the metabolic syndrome. Most current antihypertensive drugs appear ineffective against the metabolic syndrome, which is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease and death in affected patients. Angiotensin II can influence the activity of certain genes and cellular and biochemical pathways that may contribute to the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. However, as a class, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have proven only minimally to modestly effective in ameliorating the disturbances in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism that characterise the metabolic syndrome. Recent preclinical studies indicate that the ARB telmisartan acts as a selective peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) modulator when tested at concentrations that might be achievable with oral doses recommended for treatment of hypertension; this property does not appear to be shared by other ARBs. PPARgamma is a nuclear receptor that influences the expression of multiple genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and is an attractive therapeutic target for the prevention and control of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. In cellular transactivation assays, telmisartan functioned as a partial agonist of PPARgamma and achieved 25-30% of maximal receptor activation attained with conventional PPARgamma ligands. Preclinical and clinical studies indicate that administration of telmisartan can improve carbohydrate and lipid metabolism without causing the side effects that accompany full PPARgamma activators. If the preliminary data are supported by the results of ongoing large-scale clinical studies, telmisartan could have a central role in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, diabetes and atherosclerosis.", 
    "684": "Cardiovascular risk is determined by multiple risk factors, all of which greatly increase the chance of morbidity and mortality. So-called \"normal\" levels of these factors are not biologically normal, so current strategy is based on estimations of a person's global cardiovascular risk, and then using appropriate combinations of treatments in higher-risk people. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) provide multiple actions against many of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease and also show some evidence of an effect that is independent of blood pressure reduction. The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) is designed to clarify whether an ARB (telmisartan), an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) or a combination of both confers blood pressure-independent cardioprotection in high-risk patients whose blood pressure is well controlled. The Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in ACE iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) trial has the same endpoints, but will compare telmisartan with placebo in patients who are intolerant to an ACE inhibitor. Primary endpoints for both trials are the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or hospitalisation for heart failure. Recruitment is now complete, with 25 620 patients randomised in ONTARGET and 5926 in TRANSCEND. Baseline patient characteristics are similar to those in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, except that the current trials have greater ethnic diversity (including an important cohort from Asia). The subjects are slightly older and mean blood pressure at randomisation is again normal, but slightly lower than in HOPE. The use of beta-blockers and lipid-lowering therapy, known to reduce mortality and morbidity, is also higher in ONTARGET/TRANSCEND. These trials are the largest comparisons to date of ARB and ACE-inhibitor therapy in high-risk patients with controlled blood pressure, and the results will contribute significantly to the future treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "685": "Diabetic nephropathy is characterised by hypertension and persistent proteinuria. If ineffectively controlled, a progressive decline in renal function can result in end-stage renal disease. Patients with diabetic nephropathy are also at greatly increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors display additional renoprotective effects beyond systemic blood pressure lowering, perhaps due to reduction in intraglomerular pressure by inhibition of angiotensin II activity. In type 2 diabetics, ACE inhibitors have variable effects, with some studies showing a reduction in microalbuminuria, prevention of the progression to macroalbuminuria and maintenance of renal function. Randomised studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), as well as controlling systemic blood pressure, delay progression of proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Telmisartan has a number of features that may make it particularly suitable for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. In addition to its long duration of action and almost exclusive faecal excretion, its high lipophilicity should assist in tissue penetration. The Diabetics Exposed to Telmisartan And enalaprIL (DETAIL) study was designed to compare the long-term renal outcome of treatment with telmisartan 40.80 mg versus enalapril 10.20 mg (with titration to the higher dose after 4 weeks) in patients with type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertension and albuminuria. The primary endpoint is the change in glomerular filtration rate after 5 years' randomised treatment. Secondary endpoints are annual changes in glomerular filtration rate, serum creatinine and urinary albumin excretion, as well as incidences of end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality and adverse events. The groundbreaking DETAIL study revealed that telmisartan conferred comparable renoprotection to enalapril and was associated with a low incidence of mortality.", 
    "686": "Renal function is closely associated with cardiovascular risk, to the extent that even minor renal abnormalities, which are present in 10% of the general population, carry a greatly elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, target-organ damage and death. Reducing blood pressure by 20 mmHg or more in patients with severe hypertension (>160/100 mmHg) and advanced renal disease is sufficient to ensure a considerable reduction in proteinuria. In patients with less severe disease, however, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is necessary to restore normal renal function. Clinical studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which both overcome the activity of angiotensin II, provide renoprotection in diabetics and non-diabetic populations. Which class of drugs is more effective remains a subject of debate, but the evidence favours ARBs for providing more effective renoprotection in patients at risk of diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs preserve renal haemodynamics and reduce progression to end-stage renal disease by around 25% in patients with overt nephropathy and prevent progression to overt disease by up to 70% in patients with mild renal impairment. The combination of ARBs and ACE inhibitors is even more protective, halving the number of patients with progression of renal impairment compared with either monotherapy. Long-term clinical studies now under way will help to establish the relative efficacies of the ARBs and ACE inhibitors and provide greater insight into the benefits of combination therapy.", 
    "687": "Diabetes and hypertension frequently coexist, and their combination provides additive increases in the risk of life-threatening cardiovascular events. Recent guidelines agree on the need for early, aggressive reduction of blood pressure, with a goal of <130/80 mmHg, in patients with diabetes. The mechanism that underpins the increased sensitivity of diabetic subjects to hypertension is not known, but may involve impaired autoregulation or attenuated nocturnal decrease of blood pressure. All classes of antihypertensive agents are effective in reducing blood pressure in diabetic subjects, and all show evidence of a concomitant reduction in cardiovascular risk. Although there is some evidence that agents that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) provide greater protective effects, the data are not conclusive. However, most diabetic subjects will require combination therapy to reach goal blood pressure. Antihypertensive drugs can also significantly influence the probability that otherwise healthy individuals will develop metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. While diuretics and betablockers have a prodiabetic effect, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may prevent diabetes more effectively than the metabolically neutral calcium channel blockers. Given that diabetes is an important cardiovascular risk factor, there is the potential for reductions in risk due to reduced blood pressure to be offset by an increased risk due to the development of diabetes. Such concerns should be considered in the selection of antihypertensive therapy.",

In a retrospective analysis, we investigated the relationship between admission serum sodium and the primary end point of days hospitalized for cardiovascular causes within 60 days of randomization, as well as the secondary end points of in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, and 60-day mortality/rehospitalization. The number of days hospitalized for cardiovascular causes was higher in the lowest sodium quartile: 8.0 (4.5, 18.5) versus 6 (4, 13) versus 6 (4, 11.5) versus 6 (4, 12) days (P<0.015 for comparison with the lowest quartile). Lower serum sodium was associated with higher in-hospital and 60-day mortality: 5.9% versus 1% versus 2.3% versus 2.3% (P<0.015) and 15.9% versus 6.4% versus 7.8% versus 7% (P=0.002), respectively. There was a trend toward higher mortality/rehospitalization for patients who were in the lowest sodium quartile. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that serum sodium on admission, when modeled linearly, predicted increased 60-day mortality: sodium (per 3-mEq/L decrease) had a hazard ratio of 1.18 with a 95% CI of 1.03 to 1.36 (P=0.018).",

    "695": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells (ECs) was investigated using a rat model and cultured ECs. EC apoptosis was induced by 5-minute intra-arterial treatment of a rat carotid artery with 0.01 mmol/L H2O2 and was evaluated at 24 hours by chromatin staining of en face specimens with Hoechst 33342. Although activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme in arterial homogenates was not increased, administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor temocapril for 3 days before H2O2 treatment inhibited EC apoptosis, followed by reduced neointimal formation 2 weeks later. Also, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker (olmesartan) inhibited EC apoptosis, whereas angiotensin II administration accelerated apoptosis independently of blood pressure. Next, cultured ECs derived from a bovine carotid artery were treated with H2O2 to induce apoptosis, as evaluated by DNA fragmentation. Combination of angiotensin II and H2O2 dose-dependently increased EC apoptosis and 8-isoprostane formation, a marker of oxidative stress. Conversely, temocapril and olmesartan reduced apoptosis and 8-isoprostane formation induced by H2O2, suggesting that endogenous angiotensin II interacts with H2O2 to elevate oxidative stress levels and EC apoptosis. Neither an AT2 receptor blocker, PD123319, affected H2O2-induced apoptosis, nor a NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, influenced the effect of temocapril on apoptosis in cell culture experiments. These results suggest that AT1 receptor signaling augments EC apoptosis in the process of oxidative stress-induced vascular injury.",

They monitored and recorded their diet for 3 days and performed urine collections on days 2 and 3. They then stopped the CBTD for 7 days. On days 8, 9, and 10, they replicated their diets of days 1 through 3 and performed two more urine collections on days 9 and 10. Two patients took D-penicillamine, four took tiopronin, and one took tiopronin and captopril. The cystine capacity was determined, and the values obtained when the patient was on and off the CBTD were compared to determine whether CBTDs affect urinary cystine capacity. To measure the cystine capacity, we used a solid-phase assay in which cystine crystals are added to the urine and incubated for 48 hours. The crystals are spun down and resolubilized in high-pH buffer, and the amount of cystine in the crystals is calculated. The solid phase will take up cystine from urine (negative cystine capacity) that is supersaturated and give up cystine to an undersaturated urine (positive cystine capacity).", 
    "702": "All seven patients had significant improvement in urinary cystine capacity on CBTDs. The mean cystine capacity off CBTD was -130.6 +/- 280.8, while the value during CBTD use was 43.1 +/- 131.2 (P < 0.05). On CBTDs, two patients still had negative values, but both had important improvements. The mean urinary volumes were similar on and off CBTD, indicating adequate and similar fluid intake. Urine pH values and urinary excretion of sodium and urea also were comparable, indicating consistency of citrate intake and diet.", 
    "703": "Our results demonstrate that CBTDs lower the urinary supersaturation of cystine, as shown by a less-negative or more-positive cystine capacity. Cystine capacity can be measured directly, even in the presence of CBTDs. The value of this measurement lies in the potential to monitor the response to the drug, prescribe the minimum effective dose, and potentially decrease the adverse effects often associated with CBTDs.", 
    "704": "A new synthesis of the 20S proteasome inhibitor clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone is described. Our route to this important natural product involves the partial reduction of an electron deficient pyrrole as a key step. By judicious choice of enolate counterion, we were able to exert complete control over the stereoselectivity of the reduction/aldol reaction. Early attempts to complete the synthesis by using a C-4 methyl substituted pyrrole are described in full, together with our attempts to promote regioselective elimination of a tertiary alcohol. The lessons learnt from this first approach led us to develop another, and ultimately successful, route that introduced the C-4 methyl group at a late stage in the synthesis. Our successful route is then described and this contains several highly stereoselective steps including a cis-dihydroxylation and an enolate methylation. The final synthesis proceeds in just 13 steps and in 15 % overall yield making it an extremely efficient route to this valuable compound.", 
    "705": "The aim of this study was to determine whether protein remodeling of the heart ventricles and remodeling of the aorta were present in hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (hHTG) rats and whether treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril could prevent these alterations. Three groups of rats were investigated in a four week experiment control Wistar /C/rats, hHTg rats, hHTg rats given captopril (100 mg/kg/day) (hHTg + CAP). In the hHTg group, the increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) was associated with hypertrophy of the LV and RV. Protein profile analysis revealed an enhancement of metabolic protein concentration in both ventricles. The concentration of total collagenous proteins was not changed in either ventricles. However, alterations in composition of cardiac collagen were detected, characterized by higher concentration of hydroxyproline in pepsin-insoluble fraction and lower concentration of hydroxyproline in pepsin soluble faction in the LV. Hypertrophy of aorta, associated with the reduction of nitric oxide dependent relaxation, was also present in hHTG rats. Captopril normalized SBP, reduced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diminished metabolic protein concentration in both ventricles, and improved NO-dependent relaxation of the aorta. Furthermore, captopril partially reversed alterations in hydroxyproline concentration in soluble and insoluble collagenous fractions of the LV. We conclude that hypertrophy of both ventricles and the aorta are present in hHTG rats, along with protein remodeling of both ventricles. Captopril partially prevented left ventricular hypertrophy development and protein remodeling of the myocardium.", 
    "706": "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness. High intraocular pressure (IOP) has been shown to be a key risk factor for POAG. Topical application of angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to lower IOP, and angiotensin-induced increase in vascular tone has been implicated as a pathogenetic mechanism in glaucomatous cupping and damage to the optic nerve. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene and ocular signs of POAG.", 
    "707": "Baseline data from the Rotterdam Study was used. The ACE genotype was determined in 6,462 subjects. We used univariate and multiple variable statistical techniques to examine associations between ACE genotype and each of ocular hypertension, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, glaucomatous visual field defects and POAG diagnosis.", 
    "708": "We found no consistent evidence between ACE genotype and ocular signs of POAG. We did, however, find evidence of an association between ACE genotype and optic disc area, subjects homozygous for the deletion allele tending to have fractionally smaller optic disc areas than those with a single deletion allele subjects, who in turn tended to have fractionally smaller optic discs than those with no deletion alleles (P=0.01).", 
    "709": "The data provided little evidence of any association between ocular signs of POAG and the deletion polymorphism of ACE. There was, however, evidence that ACE may be associated with optic disc size-this was an unexpected finding.", 
    "710": "In patients with chronic kidney disease, the adverse cardiovascular effects of anemia have been well established. New data are emerging to suggest anemia may represent an important treatable cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. To improve the understanding of the problem of anemia in heart failure, it is important to assess the factors that influence the prevalence of anemia and to assess the consistency of the association of anemia and mortality in various populations of patients with heart failure.", 
    "711": "A systematic review of the literature was conducted by performing detailed searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE, searching the bibliographies of the articles retrieved during the database search, and conferring with heart-failure experts involved in clinical trials. Twenty-eight publications from 26 studies that evaluated anemia prevalence with or without effects on mortality in patients with heart failure were identified. The definition of anemia used in each study was tabulated along with pertinent patient characteristics, the prevalence of anemia, and the association between anemia and mortality.", 
    "712": "Anemia is common among patients with heart failure. The prevalence of anemia increases with increasing severity of heart failure, declining renal function, and increasing age. Anemia is consistently associated with poorer survival in all patient populations, but there are substantial differences in the patient populations and definition of anemia.", 
    "713": "To clarify the prognostic relationship of anemia in patients with heart failure, a standard definition of anemia should be adopted accounting for the menopausal status of women. Age, severity of heart failure, evaluation of kidney function, important comorbidities, and use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors should be included, and correctable causes of anemia should be excluded. Inclusion of these factors should allow better definition of the relationship between anemia and prognosis in patients with heart failure.", 
    "714": "In the present research, chitooligosaccharides (COS) were carboxylated with -COCH(2)CH(2)COO(-) groups to obtain specific structural features similar to Captopril. Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of carboxylated COS was studied and observed to enhance its activity with increased substitution degree. Further, Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis revealed that inhibition was competitive via obligatory binding site of the enzyme. This was accompanied with substitution of positively charged quarternized amino groups to COS with different substitution degrees, in which negative impact on ACE inhibition was observed.", 
    "715": "The stability of ramipril in the buffer solution with different pH and the influence of acid, alkaline and oxidative medium on ramipril stability were studied. The ramipril degradation products were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Acetonitrile:sodium perchlorate was used as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (linear gradient elution). A Nucleosil 100-S 5 microm C18, 250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d. was utilized as stationary phase. Detection was affected spectrophotometrically at 210 nm. The drug substance was dissolved in the ammonium phosphate buffer (pH 3, 5 and 8) and these solutions were stored at 90 degrees C for 1 h. The other series of test solutions were prepared from stock solution (drug substance dissolved in solvent A of the mobile phase) by dilution in acid (0.1M HCl), alkaline (0.1M NaOH) and oxidative (hydrogen peroxide solution) medium. More then 0.2% of impurity D (ramipril-diketopiperazine) was detected in the buffer of pH 3 and pH 5. In the buffer of pH 8 there was detected more then 1% of impurity E (ramipril-diacid). No peaks for degradation products appeared in the chromatograms above limit of quantification. The alkaline medium has the greatest effect on degradation of ramipril into impurity E (more than 50%).", 
    "716": "A specific hyphenated high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed for the determination of captopril in plasma. The drug was extracted from plasma using liquid-liquid extraction with a mixture of diethylether:dichloromethane. After the addition of the internal standard, samples were applied to a prepacked C8 Waters Symmetry column. The ion trap MS/MS detector was equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source operating in the positive ion mode. Drug determination was accomplished monitoring captopril at molecular ion m/z 218 and MS/MS (daughter) at m/z 171.6. The method was applied to captopril determination in human plasma after the administration of captopril 50 mg tablets to healthy volunteers who have participated in a pharmacokinetic study. The method was proved to be specific and precise by testing six different plasma batches. Linearity was established for the range of concentrations 25-3000 ng/ml with a regression factor of 0.9995. Intra-day accuracy ranged from 90.16 to 96.18%, while the intra-day precision ranged from 2.60 to 9.66% at the concentrations of 75, 1440 and 2500 ng/ml. Inter-day precision of the method ranged from 5.04 to 10.10%. This validated method of analysis was successfully applied to human plasma analyses after the administration of a single dose of 50 mg captopril tablets to healthy volunteers.", 
    "717": "Scleroderma renal crisis is the most severe renal manifestation of scleroderma and has been reported to recur rarely early after renal transplantation. Angiotensin II blockade is critical in preventing and treating scleroderma renal crisis, but some concern exists as to whether angiotensin II receptor blockers are clinically equivalent to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The current case indicates that late recurrences of scleroderma renal crisis are possible in renal transplant recipients and that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, rather than angiotensin II receptor blockers, may be the superior drugs for such patients.",

This study was performed to determine the low-dose effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril on pulse wave velocity (PWV), which predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients.", 
    "719": "Serum lipid levels and PWV were monitored for 12 months in 64 hemodialysis patients who were administered low doses of losartan or trandolapril or a placebo.", 
    "720": "At the start of the study, there were no differences in patient characteristics among the 3 groups. PWV tended to increase in the placebo group during the 12-month study period, but decreased significantly in the losartan and trandolapril groups, and decreases in PWV were similar in the losartan and trandolapril groups. There were no changes in blood pressure, hematocrit, erythropoietin dose, ankle-brachial index, serum lipid levels, serum 8-isoprostane levels, or serum C-reactive protein levels during the 12-month study period, but there was an increase in serum triglyceride levels in the losartan group and a decrease in serum IDL-C levels in the losartan and trandolapril groups.", 
    "721": "In hemodialysis patients, trandolapril is as effective as losartan in decreasing PWV independent of its depressor effect and in suppressing elevated IDL-C levels. Long-term blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may have a beneficial effect on the acceleration of atherosclerosis and uremic dyslipidemia.", 
    "722": "The response to angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor therapy is highly variable. Residual ACE activity during treatment, potentially modified by the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism, may explain part of this variability. We studied the possible interaction between ACE-inhibitor therapy in patients with hypertension and the ACE I/D polymorphism in incident heart failure and death.", 
    "723": "We studied 3365 hypertensive participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study, without heart failure at baseline for whom ACE-genotyping was successful. Incident heart failure was defined according to established criteria. In addition, total and cardiovascular mortality were studied as endpoints. A Cox regression model with use of ACE-inhibitors defined as time-dependent covariates was used for data-analysis. Interaction was tested in this model assuming an allele-effect relationship.", 
    "724": "Although we could not demonstrate a beneficial effect of ACE-inhibitors, there was significant interaction between the ACE I/D polymorphism (II-ID-DD) and ACE-inhibitor use in the prediction of total and cardiovascular mortality. Mortality risk associated with treatment increased with the number of D alleles present; e.g. for total mortality in the II genotype group: RR=0.95 (95% CI 0.63-1.45), in the ID genotype group: RR=1.08 (95% CI 0.84-1.38) and in the DD genotype group: RR=1.61 (95% CI 1.18-2.18).

    "726": "Assessment of vascular compliance may be a useful measurement of the clinical effects of antihypertensive treatment. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are known to improve vascular elasticity. A study was performed to test the hypothesis that combined therapy with an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker would have additive benefits on vascular compliance at similar levels of blood pressure (BP), as compared with monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor. This 12-week, double-blind study was a substudy of a larger clinical hypertension study conducted in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Subjects (N = 20) were randomized to either a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl or to enalapril monotherapy. BP, heart rate, large- and small-vessel compliance, systemic vascular resistance, and urinary microalbumin excretion were assessed at baseline and after treatment. Both treatments were similarly effective in lowering BP, reducing systemic vascular resistance, and decreasing urinary microalbumin excretion. Improvement in large-vessel compliance was significantly greater among subjects who received ACE-inhibitor/calcium channel blocker combination therapy (52%) as compared with those who received ACE-inhibitor monotherapy (32%; p < 0.05). No significant change in small-vessel compliance was observed with either treatment. Greater improvement in large-vessel compliance with combination therapy was independent of BP lowering.",

For the hypertension specialist, breast enlargement in men provides a clue to a secondary cause of hypertension or an adverse antihypertensive drug reaction. Hyperthyroidism, chronic renal failure, adrenal hyperplasia or tumors, amphetamine, cyclosporine, and anabolic steroids are secondary causes of hypertension associated with gynecomastia. Reserpine, methyldopa, and spironolactone are older drugs associated with gynecomastia; however, calcium antagonists (more commonly), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and alpha1 blockers may also be associated with this finding. Treatment is directed to removal of the underlying cause.", 
    "728": "Tissue kallikrein (TK), a major kinin-forming enzyme, is synthesized in the heart and arteries. We tested the hypothesis that TK plays a protective role in myocardial ischemia by performing ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, with and without ischemic preconditioning (IPC) or ACE inhibitor (ramiprilat) pretreatment, in vivo in littermate wild-type (WT) or TK-deficient (TK-/-) mice. IR induced similar infarcts in WT and TK-/-. IPC reduced infarct size by 65% in WT, and by 40% in TK-/- (P<0.05, TK-/- vs WT). Ramiprilat also reduced infarct size by 29% in WT, but in TK-/- its effect was completely suppressed. Pretreatment of WT with a B2, but not a B1, kinin receptor antagonist reproduced the effects of TK deficiency. However, B2 receptor-deficient mice (B2-/-) unexpectedly responded to IPC or ramiprilat like WT mice. But pretreatment of the B2-/- mice with a B1 antagonist suppressed the cardioprotective effects of IPC and ramiprilat. In B2-/-, B1 receptor gene expression was constitutively high. In WT and TK-/- mice, both B2 and B1 mRNA levels increased several fold during IR, and even more during IPC+IR. Thus TK and the B2 receptor play a critical role in the cardioprotection afforded by two experimental maneuvers of potential clinical relevance, IPC and ACE inhibition, during ischemia.",

Follow-up was for a median of 4.3 years. The primary end point was cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and resuscitated cardiac arrest. Perindopril treatment was associated with a non-significant reduction in the primary endpoint in the diabetic population, 12.6 vs. 15.5%, relative risk reduction 19% [(95% CI, -7 to 38%), P=0.13]. This was of similar relative magnitude to the 20% risk reduction observed in the main EUROPA population.",

    "732": "Refractory angina pectoris is defined as Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III or IV angina, where there is marked limitation of ordinary physical activity or inability to perform ordinary physical activity without discomfort, with an objective evidence of myocardial ischemia and persistence of symptoms despite optimal medical therapy, life style modification treatments, and revascularization therapies. The patients with refractory angina pectoris may have diffuse coronary artery disease, multiple distal coronary stenoses, and or small coronary arteries. In addition, a substantial portion of these patients cannot achieve complete revascularization and continue to experience residual anginal symptoms that may impair quality of their life and increase morbidity. This represents an end-stage coronary artery disease characterized by a severe myocardial insufficiency usually with impaired left ventricular function. As the life expectancy is increasing, patients with angina pectoris refractory to conventional antianginal therapeutics are a challenging problem. We review the nonconventional therapies to treat the refractory angina pectoris, including pharmacotherapy, therapeutic angiogenesis, transcutaneus electrical nerve and spinal cord stimulation, enhanced external counterpulsation, surgical transmyocardial laser revascularization, percutaneous transmyocardial laser revascularization, percutaneous in situ coronary venous arterializations, and percutaneous in situ coronary artery bypass. These therapies are not supported by a large body of data and have only a complementary role; therefore, the aggressive traditional and proven treatment of angina pectoris should be continued along with these therapies, used on an individual basis.", 
    "733": "Kinetic studies involving the use of both stopped-flow and diode array spectrophotometers, show that the reaction between SNAP and captopril in the presence of the metal ion sequestering agent, EDTA, occurs in two well-defined stages. The first stage is a fast reaction while the second stage is slow. The first stage has been postulated to be transnitrosation, and the second stage involves the decay of the newly formed RSNO to effect nitric oxide (NO) release. Both stages are found to be dependent on captopril and H+ concentration. The rates of the transnitrosation increased drastically with increasing pH in the first stage, signifying that the deprotonated form of captopril is the more reactive species. In the case of the second stage the variation in pH showed an increase in rate up to pH 8 after which the rate remained unchanged. Both stages were clearly distinguishable and easily monitored separately. Transnitrosation is a reversible reaction with the tendency for the equilibrium to break down at high thiol concentration. Second-order rate constants were calculated based on the following derived expressions: -d[SNAP]/dt=k(f)((K(SHCapSH)[CapSH](t))/(K(SHCapSH)+[H+]))[SNAP]. k(f) is the second-order rate constant for the forward reaction of the reversible transnitrosation process. At 37 degrees C, k(f)= 785 +/- 14 M(-1) s(-1), activation parameters [Delta]H(f)++= 49 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1), (Delta)S(f)++=-32 +/- 2 J K(-1) mol(-1). The activation parameters demonstrate the associative nature of the transnitrosation mechanism. The second stage has been found to be very complex, as a variety of nitrogen products form as predicted before. However, the following expression was derived from the initial kinetic data: rate =k1K[SNOCap][CapS-]/(K[CapS-]+ 1) to give k1= 13.3 +/- 0.4 x 10(-4) s(-1) and K= 5.59 +/- 0.53 x 10(4) M(-1), at 37 degrees C, where k1 is the first-order rate constant for the decay of the intermediate formed during the reaction between SNOCap and the remaining excess CapSH present at the end of the first stage reaction. Activation parameters are (Delta)H1++= 37 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1), (Delta)S1++=-181 +/- 44 J K(-1) mol(-1).", 
    "734": "Both the prevalence and incidence of end-stage renal disease have been increasing in the United States over the past two decades. Diabetes and hypertension are the attributable causes for more than three fourths of all new cases of end-stage renal disease. The overwhelming majority of diabetics with nephropathy are hypertensive, and lowering blood pressure is indicated in all patients with chronic kidney disease because of the increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Multiple studies indicate that reaching goal systolic blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease generally requires three to four antihypertensive agents. A number of medication combinations can effectively reduce blood pressure in the chronic kidney disease patient. In this regard, adding a calcium channel blocker to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker helps in reaching goal blood pressure while preserving renal function in both diabetics and nondiabetics with proteinuria.", 
    "735": "African Americans have a higher prevalence, earlier onset, and more rapid progression of hypertensive end-organ disease, as well as excessive hypertensive mortality compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Most differences in hypertension and pressure-related complications between African Americans and whites appear to be quantitative and not qualitative. Improving the diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension in this highly vulnerable population is a major health care goal for the new millennium. In this regard the dietary pattern to be promoted for reduction of hypertension risk in African Americans is one of increased consumption of dairy products, fruit, and vegetables as well as a continued emphasis on decreased Na+ intake. When pharmacologic therapy is considered, multi-drug approaches are generally required, with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers), and calcium channel blocker therapy as oft-selected components of most such treatment regimens.", 
    "736": "Rat spinal cord contusion injury models the histopathology associated with much clinical spinal cord injury (SCI). Studies on altered gene expression after SCI in these models may identify therapeutic targets for reducing secondary injury after the initial trauma and/or enhancing recovery processes. However, complex spatial and temporal alterations after injury could complicate interpretation of changes in gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we selected six genes and studied their temporal and spatial patterns of expression at 1 h, 1, 3 and 7 days after a standardized spinal cord contusion produced by a weight drop device (10 g x 25 mm at T8). Real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan probes was employed to quantify mRNA for proteolipid protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glial fibrillary acidic protein, nestin, and the GluR2 and NR1 subunits of glutamate receptors. We found widely different temporal and spatial patterns of altered gene expression after SCI, including instances of opposing up- and down-regulation at different locations in tissue immediately adjacent to the injury site. We conclude that greater use of the reliable and extremely sensitive technique of quantitative real-time PCR for regional tissue analysis is important for understanding the altered gene expression that occurs after CNS trauma.", 
    "737": "Recent studies in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have benefits beyond blood pressure reduction alone. Increased arterial stiffness, itself an emerging risk factor for CAD, adversely influences ventricular vascular interaction, leading to an increased central aortic pulse pressure. A number of recent studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between central pulse pressure and angiographic CAD. Furthermore, aortic stiffness also correlates with CAD. These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that central aortic stiffness may promote the development of CAD and that therapeutic intervention targeted at reducing arterial stiffness may be of benefit in patients with CAD. The ACE inhibitor, perindopril, has been shown to decrease arterial stiffness, largely independently of any effect on peripheral blood pressure. Results of the recent REASON study demonstrate that perindopril, in combination with indapamide, reduces central systolic and pulse pressure to a greater degree than the beta-blocker atenolol and that this effect is due to improved arterial stiffness and decreased wave reflection. In addition to its other beneficial effects, such as improved endothelial function and decreased inflammation, these haemodynamic effects of perindopril may therefore have contributed to the decrease in cardiovascular events seen in patients in the EUROPA study. Overall, perindopril, in addition to lowering peripheral blood pressure, decreases arterial stiffness and central pulse pressure. In individuals with CAD, perindopril would thus appear to be a very reasonable choice.", 
    "738": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a central role in the management of heart failure, reflecting the contribution of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to the pathophysiology of the condition. Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) bind specifically to the angiotensin type 1 receptor and may offer further benefits compared with ACE inhibitors. Candesartan, losartan and valsartan have all been evaluated in large clinical outcome trials in heart failure. They display marked differences in pharmacokinetics and receptor-binding properties that may contribute to observed differences in outcome. ELITE II found no significant difference in outcome with losartan as compared with captopril. In the Val-Heft trial, valsartan reduced heart failure hospitalisations when added to conventional therapy including an ACE inhibitor in most patients, but had no effect on mortality. The CHARM programme showed that candesartan reduced morbidity and mortality in heart failure with reduced systolic function, both when added to ACE inhibitor therapy or when used as an alternative in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors. Moreover, the CHARM-preserved study suggested that candesartan is beneficial in patients with heart failure and preserved left-ventricular systolic function. A growing body of evidence show that ARBs are an important contribution to the pharmaceutical management of patients with heart failure.", 
    "739": "Healthwise II, a nurse-led audit programme in primary care during 1999-2002, assessed the uptake of secondary preventative measures for coronary heart disease (CHD). Risk factors, cardiovascular medications and blood cholesterol were recorded; 'at risk' patients were invited for a review after 6 months. Of 17,570 patients assessed, CHD was clinically present in 12,045 (69%); in these, aspirin usage was high (78%) but fewer patients were on a beta-blocker (40%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (27%) or statin (49%). Blood pressure (BP) was controlled (<140/90) in only 41% of patients. Total cholesterol was >5 mmol/l in 49% of all CHD patients, half of whom were taking a statin. In the statin users, total cholesterol was uncontrolled (>5 mmol/l) in 38%. At follow-up, BP control remained at 42%, statin use increased to 57% and cholesterol remained elevated in 46%. Simple assessment in an audit programme fails to trigger change, and risk-factor modification for CHD remains inadequate.", 
    "740": "The differences between long-acting dihydropyridines and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with regard to their long-term effects on 24-h heart rate variability (HRV) and left ventricular (LV) mass are less clear in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. We studied the long-term effects of amlodipine and fosinopril on 24-h HRV and LV mass in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. In this study, 27 patients with never treated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were randomised to receive either amlodipine or fosinopril once daily as monotherapy. At baseline and at the end of the third and sixth months, each of the patients underwent 24-h HRV and ambulatory systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure analysis. LV mass index was calculated from echocardiographic examination at baseline and at the end of the sixth month. In amlodipine group (n = 14), 24-h SBP/DBP (mmHg) decreased from 144 +/- 8/94 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 6/83 +/- 3 at the end of the third month and to 125 +/- 5/81 +/- 2 at the end of the sixth month (p < 0.0001). In fosinopril group (n = 13), the respective changes were 143 +/- 9/97 +/- 7, 132 +/- 6/87 +/- 5 and 127 +/- 6/82 +/- 3 (p < 0.0001). At the end of the sixth month, LV mass index (g/m(2)) decreased from 122 +/- 26 to 105 +/- 21 in amlodipine group (p < 0.0001) and from 118 +/- 23 to 101 +/- 14 in fosinopril group (p < 0.0001). There were no significant changes in HRV parameters in both the groups. It was concluded that both drugs caused significant decrease in SBP and DBP, and LV mass in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension did not have significant long-term effects of either amlodipine or fosinopril on 24-h HRV parameters reflecting sympathetic or parasympathetic activity in these patients.",

    "745": "The abilities of captopril and niacin to protect against the lung toxicity of paraquat (PQ) were studied. The anti-oxidative action of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, appears to be attributable to the sulphahydryl group (SH) in the compound, which gives captopril the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species. Niacin replenishes the NAD and ATP depletion caused by reactive oxygen species. PQ causes lung damage in man and in several species of laboratory animals. The damage is initially manifested by hemorrhage and edema, and later by consolidation of the lung and fibrosis development. In this study, the lungs of male Wistar rats (250-300 g in weight) were perfused by Krebs-Ringer buffer alone (control), niacin (150 microM), captopril (10 microM) and PQ (600 microM) in perfusion fluid, and the biochemical changes that occurred in isolated rat lung were examined within 1 h and compared to PQ alone. The results show that captopril significantly decreases the lung weight/body weight ratio when used as a pretreatment and a post-treatment to captopril (p<0.0001). The results also show that captopril (10 microM) and niacin (150 microM) significantly decreases PQ-induced lung toxicity. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity significantly decreased in treatment groups as compared to the PQ group (p<0.0001). This study suggests that paraquat causes increased lipid peroxidation and LDH activity and decreased glutathione (GSH) and total protein in isolated perfused rat lung. These effects are reduced under these experimental conditions by captopril and niacin.", 
    "746": "The protective effects of captopril (CAP) against toxicity induced by cyclophosphamide (CP) in mice were investigated using the micronucleus assay for anticlastogenic activity in mouse bone marrow cells and liver glutathione (GSH) content. A single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of CAP at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg 1 h prior to cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg) reduced the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MnPCEs). All three doses of CAP significantly reduced the frequency of MnPCEs in mouse bone marrow compared to the group treated with CP alone (P<0.0001-0.01). CP significantly depleted the GSH content in liver but the application of CAP at a dose of 100 mg/kg 1 h before CP treatment repleted the GSH content. CAP exhibited concentration-dependent antioxidant activity, scavenging >96% of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl free radicals when used at a concentration of 0.2 mM. It appears that CAP, due to its antioxidant activity and by increasing GSH levels, can modulate the reduced cellular thiol content induced by CP and reduce the genotoxicity of CP in bone marrow cells.",

However, long-term inhibition of PARP, an enzyme involved in DNA repair, can potentially result in premature aging, loss of genome stability, and other side effects. This study evaluated potential synergistic interactions between low doses of the potent and specific PARP inhibitor 1,5-isoquinolinediol (ISO) and one of two vasodilators, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (LIS) and the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (SAL) in the model of early PDN. Control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were treated with either ISO plus LIS or ISO plus SAL for 2 weeks after an initial 2 weeks without treatment. ISO (intraperitoneally) and LIS and SAL (both in the drinking water) were used in subtherapeutic doses, resulting in a minor correction of diabetes-associated sciatic motor and hind-limb digital sensory nerve conduction deficits when administered as monotherapies. Both combination treatments corrected endoneurial blood flow and vascular conductance deficits in STZ-induced diabetic rats. ISO plus SAL corrected all other changes of PDN, i.e., motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) deficits as well as thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. With ISO plus LIS, no significant correction of MNCV was observed, and the effect on thermal hyperalgesia was quite modest. SNCV and mechanical hyperalgesia were corrected. In vitro studies in human endothelial and Schwann cells showed early accumulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins (Western blot analysis) in response to high glucose, thus suggesting the importance of PARP activation in human PDN. In conclusion, low-dose PARP inhibitor-containing combination therapies may constitute a new approach for treatment of PDN.",

    "756": "A renin-angiotensin system, separate to that in the periphery, has been found in the brain. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is crucial in the synthesis of angiotensin II, breakdown of bradykinin and the hydrolysis of several other neuropeptides such as enkephalin, substance P, dynorphin and neurotensin. Changes in the levels of ACE have been found in brains of schizophrenia patients, suggesting an involvement of ACE in the illness which awaits further investigation. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) has been suggested to be an operational measure of sensorimotor gating and is disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. We found that ACE knockout mice have increased startle responses but no differences in baseline PPI compared to wildtype controls. Treatment with the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, or the dopamine-releasing drug, amphetamine, produced significant disruption of PPI in control mice but not in ACE knockout mice. Pretreatment with the ACE inhibitor, captopril, which itself did not affect PPI, caused a reduction in the effect of apomorphine on PPI, similar to that seen in the ACE knockout mice. These data suggest an important role of ACE substrates in modulating dopaminergic mechanisms involved in PPI. Further studies are needed to ascertain if angiotensin or other neuropeptides are involved in these interactions and to investigate the neurochemical mechanism behind these effects.",

Studies with AIIAs in comparison to conventional antihypertensive agents showed improved morbidity and mortality outcomes in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (losartan) and diabetes mellitus (losartan and irbesartan). Trials with some members of the AIIA class (candesartan and valsartan) have not demonstrated such benefits in comparison to conventional agents, possibly due to differences in BP control during the trials.

    "766": "Recent large clinical trials have shown that angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and hypertension. However, the mechanism underlying antiatherogenic effects of ARBs remains unclear. The vascular endothelium is involved in the release of various vasodilators, including nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor as well as vasoconstrictors. NO plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone, the inhibition of platelet aggregation, and the suppression of smooth muscle cell proliferation. Several investigators have reported impairment in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the forearm, coronary, and renal vasculature in cardiovascular diseases, including hypertensive patients. Cardiovascular diseases are associated with alteration in endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction is the initial step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Anti-renin-angiotensin system agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve endothelial function in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. It is well known that ACE inhibitors augment endothelium-dependent vasodilation through an increase in NO bioavailability, by an increase in NO production and a decrease in NO inactivation. ARBs are also thought to prevent cardiovascular complications through an augmentation of endothelial function. In this review, we focus on recent findings and putative mechanisms of the beneficial effects of ARBs on endothelial function.", 
    "767": "Hypertension and proteinuria are risk factors for renal disease progression. There is clear evidence that pharmacological blockade of the RAS with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) reduces proteinuria and slows down the progression of renal disease in diabetic and non diabetic nephropathies, a beneficial effect not related to blood pressure control. However, not all patients respond similarly to these treatments. Some patients exhibit a significant beneficial response while others do not. The absence of response may be explained by the incomplete blockade of the RAS obtained with ACEI, which are unable to block completely the formation of AII, some generation of AII is produced via other non ACE pathways. In the search of new alternatives that could improve the antiproteinuric and nephroprotective effects of RAS blockers, the association of ACEI and ARB might prove to be useful. ARB produces a complete blockade of the RAS and stimulates the vasodilating and non-proliferative actions of AII via the AT-2 receptor. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors but not ARB; inhibit the metabolism of kinins, which increases the level of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Recently, several authors have shown a more marked antiproteinuric effect of the dual blockade of the RAS versus ACEI or ARB alone in spite of a similar effect on blood pressure. A recent study also has demonstrated that this more marked antiproteinuric effect is associated with a less progression of renal disease in primary, non diabetic nephropathies. Furthermore, at least two studies have shown that, treatment with ARB postpones end-stage renal disease and reduces the rate of decline in renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, but until now, there is not any clear evidence of a superior beneficial effect of dual blockade versus maximal recommended dose of ARB regarding renal progression in type 2 diabetic nephropathy, which is the most frequent cause of end stage renal disease. Long-term clinical trials are needed and encouraged to further establish the significant role of dual blockade in renal protection particularly in diabetic nephropathy.",

An IC(50) value of 0.28 +/- 0.04 mg/mL was determined after 180 min of digestion, while no ACE inhibitory activity was measured for the undigested SPI at 0.73 mg/mL. Chromatographic fractionation of the SPI digest resulted in IC(50) values of active fractions ranging from 0.13 +/- 0.03 to 0.93 +/- 0.08 mg/mL. Although many of the fractions showed ACE inhibition, peptides with lower molecular masses and higher hydrophobicities were most active.

The reason for this increased risk is likely multifactorial: although genetic differences may play a partial role in the etiology and pathophysiology of hypertension in black patients, factors related to lifestyle, most notably high body mass index, appear to have a greater impact. The treatment approach to lowering blood pressure in blacks is the same as for other ethnic groups. Patients should be aggressively managed, using combination therapies in the majority of them to achieve optimal blood pressure control and thereby cardiorenal protection. Although blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) appear to be less effective for lowering blood pressure and preventing kidney disease in blacks compared with whites, black patients have been underrepresented in studies of RAS blockers. Calcium channel blockers are distinctive for their potent blood pressure-lowering effects, and novel strategies such as chronotherapeutic dosing of these agents has further improved upon the flexibility of their use.", 
    "796": "In the present study, we have shown considerably accelerated thrombosis in old rats in comparison with adult rats, which may be related to the impaired hemostatic balance in these animals. In old rats, captopril and enalapril caused a marked reduction of venous thrombus weight. The mechanism of antithrombotic action of these drugs seems to be dependent on the suppression of coagulation cascade and the enhancement of the fibrinolytic processes.", 
    "797": "A significant relationship between hematocrit values and serum parameters such as the insulin like growth factor (IGF-1) and calcium was observed in patients with posttransplant erythrocytosis (PTE). Since angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) decrease hematocrit (Ht) levels in these patients, ACE genotype should play an important role. We designed this study to investigate whether ACE genotype or baseline concentrations of IGF-1, IGF-blood binding protein 3 (BP3), growth hormone (GH), or Ca influenced the response of Ht to ACEI treatment. Twenty-one kidney graft recipients with PTE were treated with enalapril (2.5 to 5 mg/d) for 1 year. IGF-1, BP3, GH, Ca, and Ht were determined before as well as 15, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days after enalapril treatment. ACE polymorphism was also determined. Enalapril treatment significantly decreased Ht levels. Only IGF-1 baseline levels showed a positive correlation to the decreased Ht (P < .025). ACE genotype as determined in 18 patients, showed no correlation with the response to enalapril. Patients with ACE genotype II showed a tendency to an earlier display of PTE. We conclude that low doses of enalapril decrease Ht levels in PTE patients; that PTE begins earlier in patients with II ACE genotype; and that only IGF-1 baseline levels influence the Ht decrease after treatment. These observations suggest that ACEI decrease the Ht via an inhibitory effect on IGF-1, which has a stimulary effect on erythropoiesis.", 
    "798": "The state of iron deposits in long-term kidney graft recipients is not well-known. Angiotensin enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce hematocrit levels in patients with posttransplant erythrocytosis (PTE), but their action on iron deposits has not been sufficiently evaluated. We designed this study to investigate the prevalence of iron deficiency among patients without anemia, the efficacy of ACEI treatment and its influence on iron deposits, and the risks of iron treatment in patients with symptomatic iron deficiency but no anemia. One hundred thirty eight patients were included if they had a kidney transplant for more than a year, with good renal function, with no anemia, and with neither iron nor rHuEpo, ARA, or ACEI treatment. One hundred seventeen had a normal Ht (group 1) and 21 had PTE (group 2). Iron deficiency was found in 73 (62.4%) group 1 patients and in 10 (47%) group 2 patients. Two group 1 patients with symptoms of iron deficiency were treated with oral iron. Their symptoms disappeared, but one developed PTE. Enalapril treatment decreased Ht levels in PTE but not in control patients. Furthermore, this drug increased iron deposits in PTE and controls with a baseline iron deficiency. We conclude that there is a high prevalence of iron deficiency in long-term transplanted patients without anemia. Furthermore, iron treatment must be carefully administered because of the risk of PTE. Enalapril treatment decreased Ht levels in PTE but not in control patients and increased iron deposits in patients with baseline iron deficiency.", 
    "799": "The aim of this work was to study the effect of early administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type-I receptors blockers (ARB) on renal function and proteinuria in renal transplant recipients with good, stable renal function and mild proteinuria. Twenty four patients started ACEI/ARB therapy within 14 months after surgery (RAS-). Before (T0) and every month for 2 years after the initiation of ACEI/ARB we evaluated creatinine clearance (CrCl), proteinuria/day (UP), UP/CrCl (FUP), arterial blood pressure, and serum lipid levels. Twenty-eight patients who never received ACEI/ARB (RAS+) were studied in the same fashion. In the RAS+ CrCl was reduced after 2 years compared with T0 (64.5 +/- 2.6 vs 75.0 +/- 3.2 mL/min, P < .003); UP and FUP were both significantly increased (666 +/- 65 vs 132 +/- 20 mg/day 8.8 +/- 1.2 vs 2.6 +/- 0.6 mg/mL x 10(3); P < .001 and .002) compared with T0. Moreover, UP (P < .04), FUP (P < .03), and the percentage reduction of CrCl (11.4% +/- 5% vs 4.6% +/- 1.8%; P < .05) were greater in RAS+ than RAS- subjects at 2 years of the study. The values of other parameters did not show significant differences between the two groups. In conclusion, this study suggested that ACEI/ARB have renoprotective effects, when used in patients with good stable renal function and mild proteinuria. These drugs may play a role to prevent chronic allograft nephropathy.", 
    "800": "One of the genes that is supposed to influence renal graft function is the one encoding angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). It shows polymorphism in the presence (I allele) or absence (D allele) of a 287-base pair fragment. The question arises whether ACE gene polymorphism of the recipient and donor influences renal graft survival. This prospective study included 94 recipients who underwent ACE genotyping (DD, DI, II) and measured their creatinine clearance after cimetidine administration. These factors were correlated with the occurrence of acute or chronic rejection and of pharmacologic treatment of hypertension. In 27 recipients it was possible to obtain the ACE genotype of the donor. Among the recipients, 36 proved to be DD genotype, 38 ID, and 20 II. Among the donors, 10 proved to be DD genotype, 10 ID, and 7 II. The changes in creatinine clearance after cimetidine administration were not significantly different among any of the genotype subgroups. Significantly higher creatinine concentrations were found among recipients with II genotype compared to the combined group of ID and DD among patients not treated with ACE inhibitors, but not among those receiving ACE I after kidney transplantation. No differences were found in the frequency of rejection episodes among the subgroups with different ACE genotypes. No significant influence of donor ACE genotype on renal graft function was observed. In summary, the I/D genotype was not an independent prognostic factor for renal graft survival in the first 4 years after transplantation. Possibly the use of ACE I alters the influence of genotype on some parameters.", 
    "801": "Hyponatremia in congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, underlining the importance of adequate assessment and treatment of this electrolyte imbalance in patients with CHF. Current treatment options for hyponatremia in CHF include hypertonic saline solution, loop diuretics, fluid restriction, and other pharmacologic agents, such as demeclocycline, lithium carbonate, and urea. Hypertonic saline solution must be administered with extreme caution because excessively slow or rapid sodium correction can lead to severe neurologic adverse effects. Loop diuretics are useful for reducing the water retention caused by CHF. However, the potent diuresis induced by agents such as furosemide results in loss of sodium and other essential electrolytes, which may exacerbate hyponatremia. Fluid restriction is only moderately effective and often difficult to implement in the hospital setting. Agents such as demeclocycline and lithium have potentially serious renal and cardiovascular side effects. The arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonists are a promising new class of aquaretic agents that increase free-water excretion while maintaining levels of sodium and other essential electrolytes. Tolvaptan (OPC-41061), lixivaptan (VPA-985), and conivaptan (YM-087) are currently under development for the treatment of hyponatremia. Although tolvaptan and lixivaptan are selective for the vasopressin-2 (V(2)) receptor responsible for the antidiuretic actions of AVP, conivaptan demonstrates activity at both the V(2) receptor and the V(1a) receptor responsible for the vasoconstricting properties of AVP. This dual receptor activity may be particularly useful in patients with CHF. These patients may benefit from the increased cardiac output, reduced total peripheral resistance, and reduced mean arterial blood pressure that results from V(1a) receptor blockade as well as the reduced congestion, reduced cardiac preload, and increased sodium concentrations induced by V(2) receptor antagonism.",

    "815": "The objectives of this article are to determine the possible mechanism of functional mitral regurgitation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and to know the effect of ramipril on left ventricle (LV) and mitral regurgitation by ECHO. Several postulates are put forth for functional mitral regurgitation in DCM, and mitral annular dilatation is said to be the primary mechanism in the past, but the exact mechanism is not clear. Though angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to remodel the LV, their beneficial effect in patients with DCM with functional mitral regurgitation is not known. Various cardiac dimensions and degree of mitral regurgitation were measured by echocardiography in 30 normal control group and in 30 patients with DCM of various etiologies except ischemic, before and after ramipril therapy. There was a significant difference in all parameters especially sphericity of left ventricle and position of papillary muscles (P < 0.0003) in DCM patients, but mitral valve annulus did not show significant change (P < 0.3) compared to control group. In 50% of the patients, the functional mitral regurgitation totally disappeared. In 30% of patients, it came down from grade II to I or became trivial. In 20% of patients, it remained unchanged. There was remarkable improvement in sphericity, LV dimension, volumes, and EF%, which increased from 31 +/- 9.81 to 39.3 +/- 8.3% (P < 0.0003). It is concluded that echocardiography clearly demonstrates the increased sphericity of LV in DCM. The lateral migration of papillary muscles possibly plays a major role in functional mitral regurgitation. Ramipril significantly reduces not only sphericity but also functional mitral regurgitation.",

    "830": "Diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of diabetes associated with a poor prognosis which deteriorates to end-stage renal disease. Increased urinary excretion of protein and albumin are early clinical markers for diabetic renal disease and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Diabetes causes activation of the renal endothelin system inducing renal damage. We analyzed the effects of SLV306, an inhibitor of both neutral endopeptidase and endothelin-converting enzyme, on diabetes-induced alterations of kidney function and morphology in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The effects of SLV306 (30 mg/kg per day), captopril (10 mg/kg per day), and placebo on urinary protein and albumin excretion as well as on blood pressure were studied in diabetic rats in comparison to non-diabetic control rats. The rats were treated for 20 weeks. At the end of the study kidney morphology was also analyzed using computer-aided image analysis systems. Serum glucose and blood pressure were similar in all diabetic groups. No side-effects were observed with SLV306 and captopril treatment. Protein excretion was 17.3 +/- 3.0 mg/24 hours in untreated diabetic rats. Protein excretion decreased significantly in the SLV306 (4.8 +/- 0.9 mg/24 hours; P = 0.03 vs untreated diabetic rats) as well as in the captopril (5.1 +/- 1.0 mg/24 hours; P = 0.03 vs untreated diabetic rats) -treated diabetic rats. Albumin excretion was 0.51 +/- 0.12 mg/24 hours in the untreated diabetic group and decreased likewise in the SLV306-treated diabetic rats (0.09 +/- 0.03 mg/24 hours; P = 0.04 vs untreated diabetic rats). The captopril-treated diabetic rats showed a strong trend towards reduced albumin excretion (0.12 +/- 0.04 mg/24 hours; P = 0.06 vs untreated diabetic rats). Computer-aided image analysis revealed that renal interstitial matrix content was significantly decreased in diabetic rats treated with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or the neutral endopeptidase/endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitor as compared to untreated diabetic rats. It was found that SLV306 decreases renal matrix protein content as well as protein and albumin excretion in diabetic rats independent of blood pressure.

YM598, but not K-8794, a selective endothelin type B receptor antagonist, inhibited the endothelin-1-induced proliferation of cultured mesangial cells derived from intact Wistar rats in a concentration-dependent manner. YM598 (0.1 or 1 mg/kg), enalapril (5 mg/kg), an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor, or vehicle was administered once daily by gastric gavage to 22-week-old male OLETF rats for 32 weeks. YM598 blunted the development of albuminuria in a dose-dependent manner. A higher dose of YM598 reduced albuminuria comparable with enalapril. Urinary endothelin-1 excretion was greater in the diabetic rats than in the control rats, and was not substantially influenced by the agents. Enalapril, but not YM598, mildly lowered the blood pressure in the diabetic rats, indicating that blood pressure reduction is not involved in the major mechanism of the renoprotective effect of YM598 in OLETF rats. These data suggest that endothelin is involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy in OLETF rats, and an endothelin type A antagonist is promising for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "832": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) is an effective therapy in hypertension. Vasopeptidase inhibition was initially proposed with compounds inhibiting both angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase (omapatrilat), but clinical trials revealed that reducing angiotensin II while blocking the degradation of vasodilatory peptides was not without concerns. We have previously investigated the combination of an ACEi with an endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ECEi); now we add a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (NEPi) toward triple vasopeptidase inhibition. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats were surgically implanted with a vascular catheter and treated with an ACEi (benazepril), a NEPi (CGS 24592) and an ECEi (CGS 35066) (continuous intra-arterial infusion at 1 or 5 mg/kg/day x 5 days each). After 15 days, drugs administration was stopped for 3 days. ACEi (1 mg/kg per day) reduced the mean arterial blood pressure by 8.4%. The addition of a NEPi and an ECEi at the same dose did not shown any added benefit. The mean arterial blood pressure came back to baseline upon cessation of treatment. ACEi (5 mg/kg per day) reduced the mean arterial blood pressure by 28%. The mean arterial blood pressure remained attenuated by 21% and 19% with the addition of the NEPi and the ECEi. Again, the mean arterial blood pressure rose back to 148 +/- 4 mmHg following cessation of treatment. Daily biochemical and hematological analysis of plasma did not reveal any signs of toxicity, except for a rapid elevation in K (40%) after 1 day of ACEi. Thus, angiotensin II inhibition plays a primary role in controlling the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive whereas additional NEPi and ECEi did not provide further benefits under the present dose combinations. The normalizing effect of the higher dose of ACEi by itself made it impossible to discriminate the role of neutral endopeptidase and endothelin-converting enzyme-modulated peptides and to further define the paradigm of triple vasopeptidase inhibition toward better control of vascular hemodynamics. Additional studies are underway.", 
    "833": "In congestive heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) may prevent cardiac fibrosis via interaction with both angiotensin II and endothelin-1, which enhance myocardial collagen synthesis. However, whether endogenous bradykinin with an ACEI modifies the cardiac collagen architecture, affecting the endothelin system, has not yet been fully elucidated. We evaluated the changes in circulating hormonal factors, myocardial fibrosis and cardiac gene expression closely linked with heart failure, using an orally active specific bradykinin type 2 receptor antagonist, FR173657 (0.3 mg/kg/day, n = 6), with an ACEI, enalapril (1 mg/kg/day), in dogs with tachycardia-induced congestive heart failure (270 p.p.m., 22 days) and compared the effects with enalapril alone (n = 6). Although there were no differences observed in blood pressure, plasma renin activity, aldosterone and endothelin-1 levels, combined FR173657 significantly increased the cardiac expression of preproendothelin- 1 mRNA (P < 0.05) and collagen type I and type III mRNA (P < 0.05), and cardiac collagen deposits (P < 0.05), and decreased eNOS gene expression (P < 0.05) in the left ventricle compared with the ACEI-treated group. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between the expression of preproendothelin- 1 and eNOS mRNA levels (r = -0.708, P < 0.001). In conclusion, bradykinin may prevent cardiac fibrosis in part via suppression of the local endothelin system in the failing heart through the enhancement of nitric oxide production under chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.",

In conscious rats, CGS 35601 suppressed the big endothelin-1-induced pressor response by 82% and 72% at 30 and 120 minutes, respectively, following injection at a dose of 10 mg/kg, intravenously. At the same dose, CGS 35601 increased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) immunoreactivity by 170% for up to 4 hours in conscious rats infused with ANP, and it inhibited the angiotensin I-induced pressor response by 74-94% within the first 2 hours after dosing. Similar in vivo activities were also observed with its orally active prodrug, CGS 37808. This compound blocked the big endothelin-1- induced pressor response by 71% and 67% at 30 and 120 minutes, respectively, after an oral dose of 10 mgEq/kg in conscious rats. It also increased plasma ANP immunoreactivity by 103% for up to 4 hours and inhibited the angiotensin I-induced pressor response by an average of 49% within the first 4 hours after the same dosing regimen. By suppressing the biosyntheses of endothelin-1 and angiotensin II, two potent vasoconstrictors, while simultaneously potentiating the circulating levels of ANP, a vasorelaxant and diuretic, CGS 35601 and CGS 37808 may represent novel agents for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases.",

This effect was suppressed when the dogs had been treated for 3 weeks with the beta1-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril. We conclude that OLC changes rapidly during exercise and is under the control of norepinephrine and angiotensin II.",

    "837": "Thirty healthy rats were randomized into 3 groups, namely the control group, captopril group and losartan group, respectively. Blood and urine samples were collected from the rats for detecting serum Na(+), urine volume and urine osmolality in the course of medication. Urine AQP2 concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed for measurement of kidney inner medullary AQP2 and vasopressin V(2) receptor mRNA.", 
    "838": "Urine volume was increased in rats of captopril and losartan groups as compared with that of the control group. However, urine osmolality was lower in captopril group than in the other two groups (P<0.05). RT-PCR revealed decreased quantity of the inner medullary AQP2 mRNA of the captopril group than that of the other two groups, but the quantity of V(2) receptor mRNA did not differ significantly between the 3 groups. Urine AQP2 concentration was significantly higher in captopril group than in the control (P<0.05) and losartan groups (P0<0.01).",

    "840": "The current understanding of the interrelationships among hemodynamic, hormonal, and metabolic factors in the pathophysiology of renal disease remains incomplete. In the kidney, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in all three of these physiologic pathways. There is no doubt that hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors for the progression of renal disease and that interruption of the RAS is renoprotective. In particular, the balance of interactions between angiotensin II and nitric oxide is a key factor in determining whether injury or protection of target organs ensues. Experimental studies suggest a novel link between hemodynamic and metabolic factors that may cooperate to induce progressive glomerular injury in conditions characterized by glomerular hypertension. Emerging data from experimental and clinical studies may lead to improvements in therapeutic efforts to prevent or slow the progression of renal disease.", 
    "841": "In this manuscript, we describe our ongoing randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of blood pressure control with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on renal cyst growth over a 5-year study period in children and young adults aged 4-21 years with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Baseline demographic and laboratory data for the study groups are reported. Results of this study could significantly impact the standard of care for management of ADPKD in this population.", 
    "842": "Leukocyte infiltration and activation in myocardial reperfusion injury may be modulated by nitric oxide synthase isoforms. Angiotensin II influences leukocyte activation directly or by nitric oxide generation mechanisms. The effects of angiotensin II inhibition before reperfusion on myocardial function, leukocyte accumulation and nitric oxide synthase were evaluated on three groups of eight dogs. They were submitted to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 90 min, followed by 120 min of reperfusion. The first group received captopril, the second losartan and the third received normal saline solution. Left ventricular ejection fraction significantly improved after reperfusion in the groups under captopril (15+/-5.1%, p=0.029) and losartan (16+/-4.3%, p=0.014) when compared to the control group (7+/-2.5%). Myeloperoxidase activity was significantly lower in captopril group (6.6+/-1.0 U/100 mg, p=0,036) and losartan (6.8+/-1.7 U/100 mg, p=0.044) than in the control group (12.5+/-4.7 U/100 mg). Significant difference on constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity was not observed when all three groups were compared simultaneously (10.1+/-1.8 versus 8.5+/-1.3 versus 7.3+/-1.9 fM/mg/min, p=0.447). Inducible nitric oxide synthase activity was significantly lower in the losartan group (9.0+/-4.1 fM/mg/min) than in the captopril (29.2+/-5.1 fM/mg/min, p=0.0001) and control groups (26.2+/-4.6 fM/mg/min, p=0.0001). Angiotensin II inhibition reduced leukocyte infiltration and improved left ventricular ejection fraction during reperfusion by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or by angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker. This was observed without influencing the constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity. Only losartan reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase activity but did not influence the leukocyte infiltration and myocardial contractile function.", 
    "843": "Peritoneal adhesions are pathological fibrotic bands developing after mesothelial damage. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) has mitogenic activities for macrophages and fibroblasts. Over-expression of TGF-beta1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several fibrotic disorders. Angiotensin II increases the expression of the TGF-beta1 in fibroblasts. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) on intraperitoneal adhesions.", 
    "844": "Thirty male Wistar albino rats were divided into two groups. In the first procedure, laparotomy was performed through a 3-cm midline incision. Ileum was divided above 10 cm from ileocecal valve and a single-layer ileoileal anastomosis was performed. Although no treatment was given to rats in group 1, lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) was given to rats in group 2 for postoperative 7 days in drinking water. Estimated amount of supplied lisinopril was 6.5 mg/kg/day. On postoperative 8th day, relaparotomy was performed and adhesions were evaluated. At the same time, blood samples were taken for TGF-beta1 measurements.", 
    "845": "Adhesion severity was significantly less in the ACE inhibitor group (P < 0.001). While mean TGF-beta1 level was 860.3 +/- 108.1 pg/dl (mean +/- SD) in control group, it was 335.8 +/- 52.4 pg/dl in ACE inhibitor group (P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between serum TGF-beta1 levels and grade of adhesions (r = 0.948).", 
    "846": "It was concluded that ACE inhibitors might be useful for preventing peritoneal adhesions.", 
    "847": "The premise of the problem-oriented medical record is that an accurately defined problem list will directly result in more thorough and efficient patient care.

This association remained after statistical adjustment for age, gender, and ejection fraction. Patients with accurate problem list entries were also more likely to receive digoxin (61.1% vs 36.7%; P=.001) and spironolactone (26.7% vs 13.3%; P=.025). There were no differences in the use of beta-blockers between the 2 groups.",

    "855": "Chronotherapy can improve the effectiveness and reduce the adverse reactions of drugs and actually is used for several conditions including cardiovascular diseases. Although angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are available for the therapy of patients with hypertension and/or heart failure, these agents have some characteristic adverse effects such as angioedema and dry cough. It has been reported that the dosing of ACE inhibitor at an inactive period has a better protective effect against cardiac hypertrophy in hypertensive rats, and changing dosing time from morning to evening reduces the severity and frequency of the drug-induced dry cough of hypertensive patients treated in the morning. Thus, the dosing of ACE inhibitors in the inactive span is more effective and safe. Dosing in the evening may be an alternative for hypertensives with dry cough with a morning dose of ACE inhibitors, if one ascertains that no circadian hyperamplitude tension is induced by the evening dose of this or any other antihypertensive drug.", 
    "856": "The aim of this study was to investigate a significance of increased proteinuria in the morning and the effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria and arterial blood pressure in the progression of chronic renal insufficiency in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension and nephropathy. In three 24-hr urine samples and blood pressure monitoring, separated into a night-and daytime and spot urine in the morning, variation in protein-creatinine ratio (g/g) and blood pressure were assessed in 24 (58 +/- 3 years old; M/F: 17/7) diabetic patients with hypertension and nephropathy. Furthermore, the effects of antihypertensive therapy of combinations of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, calcium antagonists, diuretics, and alpha1 blocker were evaluated in 3 years. Home blood pressure measurement was carried out every month and 24-hr urine was collected every 2 months. The baseline urine excretion of protein-creatinine ratio and blood pressure were (1.22 +/- 0.13 g/g creatinine: 154/96 +/- 6/5 mmHg) in daytime and (1.39 +/- 0.13: 168/88 +/- 15/7) in the morning. At the end of the study, significant associations among a decline of 24-hr creatinine clearance and both of the urine excretion of protein-creatinine ratio (r = 0.47, p < .01) and the levels of systolic blood pressure (r = 0.46, p < .01) and between the levels of systolic blood pressure and the urine excretion of protein-creatinine ratio in the morning (r = 0.57, p < .001) were demonstrated. However, there were no significant associations among other variables. Analysis of patients who had systolic blood pressure in the morning less than 140 mmHg revealed that 65% of these patients received doxazosin-averaged doses of 4.8 +/- 1.5 mg daily. The levels of both blood pressure and proteinuria-creatinine ratio in the morning mainly associate with progression of renal function in diabetic patients with hypertension and nephropathy.",
