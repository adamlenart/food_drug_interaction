For many years is not lost interest in the pharmacological blockade of RAAS in order to achieve target levels of BP and prevent damage target organs, particularly kidneys. Most recently recommended for clinical application of direct rennin inhibitor--aliskiren, a number of researcher have proven expressed nephroprotective effect. However, at present there is no unequivocal answer to the question whether there are advantages in combined RAAS blockade in hypertensive patients with use of aliskiren and angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.", 
    "1": "High blood pressure is a major cardiovascular risk factor and its treatment reduces the risk. Five classes of antihypertensive drugs are suitable for the treatment of hypertension either as monotherapy or in some combinations with each other: thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. The benefits of antihypertensive treatment are mainly due to lowering of blood pressure and are largely independent of the drug employed. For a given reduction in blood pressure, there is no evidence that \"new\" antihypertensive agents are superior to \"old\" agents. In the majority of patients, two or more antihypertensive drugs are required to achieve target blood pressure levels. Preferred drug combinations are diuretics with any of other antihypertensive drugs (with the exception of the combination with beta-blockers in patients at risk of diabetes mellitus), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with calcium antagonists. On the other hand, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor antagonist should not be employed because of a high incidence of serious adverse renal outcomes. Recently, the first orally active direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, has been launched for clinical use. The results of ongoing long-term outcome studies will determine the place of aliskiren in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "2": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease characterised by widespread vascular lesions and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Cardiac involvement is recognised as a poor prognostic factor when clinically evident. Primary myocardial involvement is common in SSc. Increasing evidence strongly suggests that myocardial involvement is related to repeated focal ischaemia leading to myocardial fibrosis with irreversible lesions. Reproducible data have shown that this relates to microcirculation impairment with abnormal vasoreactivity, with or without associated structural vascular abnormalities. Consistently, atherosclerosis and macrovascular coronary lesions do not seem to be increased in SSc. Myocardial involvement leads to abnormal systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular dysfunction. Sensitive and quantitative methods have demonstrated the ability of vasodilators, including calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, to improve both perfusion and function abnormalities further emphasising the critical role of microcirculation impairment. Recent quantitative methods such as tissue Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging have underlined these results.", 
    "3": "Age-dependent renal damage is influenced by genetic background and the Fisher344xBrown Norway (F344xBN) rat is resistant to glomerular injury. In vulnerable strains, a fall in renal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) contributes to age-dependent renal damage. Here, we investigated renal NOS in young (3 months) and old (30 months) male F344xBN to test the hypothesis that renal NOS is maintained in \"protected\" strains. We also examined if 6 months of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB) provides further benefit in these \"protected\" old rats. Aging increased tubulointerstitial injury but glomerular sclerosis was minimal and NOS and superoxide dismutase abundance increased. There was no change in the NOS inhibitor, ADMA (asymmetric dimethylarginine) or its regulatory enzymes. RAS blockade with ARB protected against tubulointerstitial injury and increased nNOS\u03b1, but ACEI, which also increased nNOS\u03b1, had no protective effect on the tubulointerstitium. We conclude that the glomerular sclerosis-resistant aged male F344xBN rat maintains renal NOS, thus reinforcing our hypothesis that progressive glomerular injury is related to renal NOS deficiency. The tubulointerstitial injury seen with aging is reversed with 6 months of ARB but not ACEI and is not associated with renal NOS.", 
    "4": "Pharmacotherapy of atrial fibrillation (AF) is demanding, because currently available antiarrhythmic drugs have low efficacy and many side effects. In drug development, the focus has been on amiodarone-like multichannel blockers, atrial-specific ion channel blockers, and novel non-channel agents targeting atrial remodelling. Dronedarone, an amiodarone analogue without iodine, was recently approved for treatment of AF. It is less effective than amiodarone, but serious adverse events are rare. Vernakalant, an atrial-selective drug with low proarrhythmic risk, is effective in cardioversion and it may also prevent AF recurrences. So-called upstream therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin receptor inhibitors, statins and omega-3 fatty acids needs further clinical validation.", 
    "5": "The paper covers current problems in the treatment of arterial hypertension. Renin is an important and promising therapeutic target. The direct renin inhibitor aliskiren (Rasilez) is a promising current effective antihypertensive agent that has cardio- and nephroprotective effects. The paper considers a number of clinical studies that have proven the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren and revealed its benefits versus other drugs recommended for blood pressure lowering. It is assumed that this agent may be used in combinations with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and calcium antagonists. Moreover, aliskiren neutralizes the effect of feedback in the compensatory increase in the activity of plasma renin.",

We aimed to investigate the association between prothrombotic gene polymorphisms detected in lung cancer cases and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Totally 66 patients with an established diagnosis of lung cancer, of which 33 developed DVT, were enrolled. Multiplex PCR technique and reverse hybridization strip assay were performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood, in order to analyze prothrombin G20210A, factor V G1691A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and glycoprotein IIIa (Gp IIIa) gene mutations. Among prothrombotic gene polymorphisms investigated in this study, the commonest ones were PAI-1 4G/5G (56% heterozygous, 39% homozygous) and ACE gene mutations (58% heterozygous, 17% homozygous). The presence of homozygous MTHFR A1298C mutation was significantly associated with DVT (P=0.020). Comparing the lung cancer patients with and without DVT, only MTHFR A1298C gene polymorphism differed significantly (P=0.040). We determined a higher rate of prothrombotic gene mutations in lung cancer patients who developed DVT. However, statistical significance was achieved only for MTHFR A1298C gene mutation. Therefore, nongenetic factors for disturbance of hemostatic metabolism should also be considered in lung cancer patients.",

In the eight-week run-in period, therapy using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and/or angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonists (ARB) was adjusted to achieve a blood pressure below 130/80 mm Hg. Next, patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences: ATO/washout/placebo or placebo/washout/ATO. Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests were performed at the randomization point and after each period of the study. The primary end point of this study was a change in proteinuria measured as 24-h urine protein excretion (DPE).

Associations were tested using multivariable linear regression with adjustment for demographics (age, gender, annual income), comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, smoking, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, ACE inhibitor and statin use) and systemic inflammation [interleukin-6 (IL-6)].",

These results provide a rationale for subsequent testing of AT1R-targeted imaging to predict the risk for ventricular remodeling and to monitor the efficacy of anti-RAS drug therapy.", 
    "28": "Potassium chloride and other potassium compounds are used by the general public as salt substitutes, muscle-building supplements, and panacea. Severe hyperkalemia from oral potassium is extremely rare if kidney function is normal because of potassium adaptation. The oral potassium dose has to be large enough to overcome the normal renal excretory mechanisms to cause severe hyperkalemia. This occurs most commonly in patients with renal impairment or those who take potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We present two unique cases of near-fatal hyperkalemia from nutritional supplements containing potassium. The first case was due to salt-substitute intake, whereas the second case was from a muscle-building supplement. Both patients suffered cardiac arrest, but were successfully resuscitated and survived. The acuity of intake and excessive quantity overwhelmed the kidneys' ability for adaptation. Potassium toxicity affects multiple organ systems and manifests in characteristic, acute cardiovascular changes with electrocardiographic abnormalities. Neuromuscular manifestations include general muscular weakness and ascending paralysis may occur, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms manifest as nausea, vomiting, paralytic ileus, and local mucosal necrosis that may lead to perforation. Once an urgent situation has been handled with intravenous push of a 10% calcium salt, short-term measures should be started with agents that cause a transcellular shift of potassium, namely, insulin with glucose, \u03b22-agonist, and NaHCO(3). Patients are unaware of these potentially serious adverse effects, and there are inadequate consumer warnings. Clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring potassium intake from over-the-counter supplements.",

The mainstay of therapy is oral corticotherapy. Associations of interstitial nephritis with various autoimmune disorders have been described. We hereby report the case of a 69-year-old Caucasian man with a 2-year history of autoimmune pancreatitis, who presented with impairment of kidney function, proteinuria, and hypertension. Renal histopathology showed severe diffuse interstitial nephritis. With oral prednisone and ACE inhibitor therapy, complete recovery of kidney function was not achieved and proteinuria persisted. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil was initiated. After 8 weeks, serum creatinine decreased, and a nearly complete and sustained resolution of proteinuria was seen, while tapering oral steroid doses. With autoreactive T cells playing a major role in the pathogenesis of both diseases, a common etiology of pancreatitis and interstitial nephritis can be assumed, and the beneficial effects of an inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation, such as mycophenolate mofetil, can be explained. We infer from our case that mycophenolate mofetil can be effective in the control of simultaneous autoimmune pancreatitis and interstitial nephritis.", 
    "59": "Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Podocytes are highly differentiated, pericyte-like cells that are essential for normal function of the kidney filter. Loss of podocytes is a hallmark of progressive kidney diseases including diabetic nephropathy. Podocytes are a direct target for angiotensin II - mediated injury by altered expression and distribution of podocyte proteins. Additionally, angiotensin II promotes podocyte injury indirectly by increasing calcium influx and production of reactive oxygen species. Notwithstanding the convincing rationale for angiotensin II blockade as a treatment modality, the incidence of diabetes-related end stage renal disease has increased steadily despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Recently published clinical trials have rekindled a debate on the safety and efficacy of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This review summarizes the rationale for blockade of angiotensin II as a therapeutic target in treating diabetic kidney disease, including the critical role played by podocytes. Recent relevant clinical trials on the role of RAS blockade in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease are discussed.",

    "62": "A retrospective, descriptive analysis was performed using the National Summary Files from the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data, which are composed of pharmacy claims that are subject to federally mandated rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers. For the years 1991-2008, quarterly claim counts and expenditures were calculated by summing data for individual ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Quarterly per-claim expenditure as a proxy for drug price was computed for all brand and generic drugs. Market shares were calculated based on the number of pharmacy claims and Medicaid expenditures.", 
    "63": "In the Medicaid fee-for-service program, ACE inhibitors accounted for 100% of the claims in the combined market for ACE inhibitors and ARBs in 1991, 80.6% in 2000, and 64.7% in 2008. The Medicaid expenditure per ACE inhibitor claim dropped from $37.24 in 1991 to $24.03 in 2008 when generics accounted for 92.5% of ACE inhibitor claims; after adjusting for inflation for the period from 1991 to 2008, the real price drop was 59.2%. Brand ACE inhibitors accounted for only 7.5% of the claims in 2008 for all ACE inhibitors but 32.1% of spending; excluding the effects of manufacturer rebates, Medicaid spending would have been reduced by $28.7 million (9%) in 2008 if all ACE inhibitor claims were generic. The average price per ACE inhibitor claim in 2008 was $24.03 ($17.64 per generic claim vs. $103.45 per brand claim) versus $81.98 per ARB claim. If the ACE inhibitor ratio had been 75% in 2008 rather than 64.7%, the Medicaid program would have saved approximately 13% or about $41.8 million, again excluding the effects of manufacturer rebates. If the ACE inhibitor ratio had been 90% in 2008, the cost savings for the combined Medicaid fee-forservice programs would have been about 33% or about $102.3 million. The total cost savings opportunity with 100% generic ACE inhibitor utilization in 2008 and an ACE inhibitor ratio of 75% was $75.1 million (24%) or $142.3M (46%) with a 90% ACE inhibitor ratio.", 
    "64": "Factors that affect Medicaid spending by contributing to increased utilization of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, such as the rising prevalence of hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes, can be offset by reduction in the average price attained through a higher proportion of ACE inhibitors and a higher percentage of generic versus brand ACE inhibitors.", 
    "65": "Anemia is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). The diagnosis of anemia should prompt assessment of the underlying cause(s), first by using routine laboratory measurements (i.e., serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, vitamin B12, folic acid, and thyroid stimulating hormone). In clinical practice, it remains unclear whether using levels of the soluble transferrin receptor in HF patients to assess iron deficiency is warranted. Further investigation should follow these simple tests when judged appropriate (e.g., if occult gastrointestinal blood losses are suspected). Hemodilution may contribute significantly to anemia in patients with advanced HF and may be suspected when signs of hypervolemia are present. Euvolemia should be the first goal in such cases (as always), followed by optimization of the disease-modifying therapies used in HF (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, or aldosterone antagonists and cardiac resynchronization therapy in selected cases). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) can be used to improve functional capacity in patients with significant chronic kidney disease (CKD), a frequent comorbidity in HF patients. ESA and iron therapy is recommended in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eGFR\u2009<\u200960\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m(2)), with a target hemoglobin level of 11.0\u00a0g/dL. In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, weekly administration of intravenous iron significantly improved symptoms, New York Heart Association class, quality of life, and exercise capacity in both anemic and non-anemic HF patients. A trend toward fewer hospitalizations was seen in the group treated with intravenous iron. The rates of adverse events were similar in the treatment and the placebo groups. Larger-scale and longer-term studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy profile of intravenous iron in non-CKD HF patients and in HF patients without anemia. Studies designed to further unravel the pathophysiology of anemia in HF are essential in order to determine 1) novel treatment targets and 2) whether and how the treatment of anemia could improve outcomes.",

We identified a total of 194 patients with native tricuspid valvular AS, defined as a continuous-wave Doppler determined peak aortic valve jet velocity of \u2265 2.0 m/s, in whom echo Doppler studies were repeated at an interim of at least 6 months. Annualized change in peak jet velocity was calculated, and effects of age, sex, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure, serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and use of statins and antihypertensive agents on the progression of AS were retrospectively evaluated. Peak aortic valve jet velocity was 2.36 \u00b1 0.79 m/s (mean \u00b1 SD) and annualized increase in peak aortic valve jet velocity was 0.17 \u00b1 0.32 m/s/year for all the studied patients. The increase in peak aortic valve jet velocity was lower in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) than in those not taking ACE-Is (0.04 \u00b1 0.22 vs. 0.20 \u00b1 0.32 m/s/year, P < 0.05). Such protective associations were not observed for other first-line antihypertensive agents and statins. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that ACE-I treatment, decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction, and higher peak aortic valve jet velocity at the first echocardiogram were associated with slower progression of AS. Administration of ACE-Is was associated with the slow progression of mild AS in Japanese patients. Prospective study to assess this hypothesis is needed.",

SRC occurs in 2% to 5% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), particularly those with diffuse cutaneous SSc in the first years of disease evolution. Several retrospective studies have found high-dose corticosteroid therapy to be associated with increased risk of SRC, and anti-RNA-polymerase III antibodies have been detected in one third of patients with SRC. Treatment relies on the early control of blood pressure with increasing doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, eventually associated with calcium channel blockers together with dialysis if necessary. After 2 years on dialysis, eligible patients should be considered for renal transplantation. The strategy for prevention of SRC lacks consensus. However, corticosteroids and/or nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc.", 
    "74": "Arterial generalized transfer functions (GTFs) are increasingly used to estimate central pressure from peripheral measurements. Analysis of derived central waveforms may be valuable in the assessment of patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to assess whether the GTF is affected by renal disease. Ninety-four subjects with varying degrees of renal function (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative stages 1 to 5; 14 controls) had simultaneous measurements of carotid and radial waveforms made by applanation tonometry. GTFs were calculated by Fourier analysis for each subject group. Derived carotid waveforms were obtained by applying an independently generated GTF to the radial waveform. Glomerular filtration rate inversely correlated with central systolic (R = -0.42; P < 0.001), mean (R = -0.34; P < 0.01) and diastolic (R = --0.27, P < 0.01) blood pressures, as well as central augmentation index (R = -0.30; P< 0.01) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (R = -0.33; P < 0.001). Derived waveforms were not significantly different from measured waveforms in terms of systolic blood pressure, augmentation index, maximum slope, or the delay between the incident and reflected waves, although the derived waveforms slightly underestimated the systolic ejection period (-4.4 \u00b1 0.9 ms; P < 0.001). Overall root-mean-square error was 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 mm Hg. No significant relationship existed between the degree of bias of any derived waveform measure and glomerular filtration rate or chronic kidney disease stage (P > 0.16). No significant differences between chronic kidney disease stages were observed in transfer function gain or phase (P > 0.05). We conclude that the peripheral-to-central GTF is not affected by degree of renal dysfunction and can be used with equivalence in patients with varying degrees of chronic kidney disease.",

Aldosterone levels are elevated and might impair ventricular function through adverse myocardial and vascular proinflammatory and fibrotic effects. In the Chronic Renal Impairment in Birmingham II (CRIB II) study, it was hypothesized that mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with spironolactone in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers would improve left ventricular (LV) function and markers of inflammation, ventricular stretch, and collagen turnover in early CKD. A total of 112 patients with early CKD were randomized to spironolactone 25 mg/day or placebo for 40 weeks. Ventricular function was assessed by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging tagging. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen were measured. Spironolactone improved LV long-axis systolic function (Sm 8.2 \u00b1 1.4 vs 7.7 \u00b1 1.3 cm/s, p <0.05), torsion (7.77 \u00b1 1.61\u00b0 vs 6.77 \u00b1 1.48\u00b0, p <0.05), and myocardial deformation (strain rate -1.14 \u00b1 0.24 vs -1.09 \u00b1 0.20 s(-1), p <0.05) compared to placebo, without a change in the ejection fraction.

Subjects with anaemia exhibited lower IGF-1 (p=0.006), and higher hsCRP levels (p=0.003). To estimate the independent contribution of variables to Hb concentration, a multivariable regression analysis was modeled including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, IGF-1, fibrinogen, hsCRP, mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum iron, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).

Hb concentration was significant lower in subjects in the lowest IGF-1 quartile as compared with those in the third (p=0.02) and fourth (p=0.001). In a logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, fibrinogen, hsCRP, MCH, MCV, serum iron, eGFR, and treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, subjects in the first quartile of IGF-1 had a 2.49-fold higher risk of having anaemia as compared with those in the fourth (odds ratio 2.70, 95% confidence interval 1.02-7.16).

Loss of nephrin reportedly causes excess urinary protein excretion; therefore, we determined whether Ac-SDKP inhibits proteinuria by restoring nephrin expression in the glomerulus of hypertensive mice. DOCA-salt significantly downregulated glomerular nephrin expression (controls, 37 \u00b1 8; DOCA-salt, 10 \u00b1 1.5% of glomerular area; P < 0.01), which was partially reversed by Ac-SDKP (23 \u00b1 4.0% of glomerular area; P = 0.065, DOCA-salt vs. DOCA-salt + Ac-SDKP).",

The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE), a landmark study in high cardiovascular risk management, demonstrated the cardioprotection of the ACE inhibitor ramipril. Thus, in the recent Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET\u00ae) ramipril was selected as a comparator when exploring the cardioprotective potential of telmisartan in the first head-to-head comparison of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a broad cross-sectional cohort of cardiovascular high-risk patients. ONTARGET showed that telmisartan is as effective as ramipril in the management of these patients but is better tolerated. The combination of ramipril and telmisartan did not confer a further benefit but did bring about an increased rate of adverse events such as renal dysfunction. In previous ARB outcome trials, cardiovascular risk profile, nature and severity of the underlying cardiovascular disease, dosing regimens and concomitant therapies, follow-up, and endpoints have varied greatly so that caution is warranted in extrapolating evidence gained from high-risk patients to other conditions such as acute myocardial infarction or chronic heart failure.",

An age-related decrease in the density of CGRP-like immunoreactive (LI)-containing nerve fibers but not neuropeptide Y (NPY)-LI-containing sympathetic nerve fibers was found in the mesenteric artery of SHR but not Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The density of NPY-LI-containing nerve fibers was significantly greater in SHR than in WKY.

Each drug treatment significantly lowered the systolic blood pressure measured using the tail-cuff method. Long-term treatment of SHR with temocapril and losartan significantly increased the density of CGRP-LI-containing nerve fibers in mesenteric arteries. Furthermore, to clarify the effect of the angiontensin II type-2 (AT2) receptor in the restoration of perivascular nerve innervation, we used the phenol-injured rat model, in which the perivascular nerves are markedly reduced by the topical application of phenol. Activation of AT2R significantly restored CGRP-LI innervation in phenol-injured rats.

The erythrocyte CAT activity was significantly increased in all the drug treated groups with maximum increase seen in O. sanctum and ramipril treated groups, whereas lesser effects were observed with C. mukul and folic acid groups. Thus, the indigenous drugs, C. mukul and O. sanctum had beneficial effect on hypercholesterolemic rabbit model, both in terms of lipid profile as well as antioxidant potential.

After 4 weeks of untreated diabetes, rats were treated for 12 weeks with Ilepatril, Enalapril (ACE inhibitor) or Candoxatril (neutral endopeptidase inhibitor) followed by analysis of neural and vascular function. Diabetes caused slowing of motor and sensory nerve conduction, thermal hypoalgesia, reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the hindpaw and impairment in vascular relaxation to acetylcholine and calcitonin gene-related peptide in epineural arterioles of the sciatic nerve and to atrial natriuretic peptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide in renal arteries. Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase or ACE improved neural function; however, dual inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and ACE with Ilepatril tended to have the greatest efficacy. Ilepatril and Candoxatril treatment of diabetic rats was more efficacious in improving vascular responsiveness in epineurial arterioles than treatment with Enalapril. Ilepatril, Enalapril or Candoxatril treatment of diabetic rats were all efficacious in renal arteries.

Mean SBP at baseline was 149.3\u00b15.58 mmHg in Olive group and 148.4\u00b15.56 mmHg in Captopril group; and mean DBPs were 93.9\u00b14.51 and 93.8\u00b14.88 mmHg, respectively. After 8 weeks of treatment, both groups experienced a significant reduction of SBP as well as DBP from baseline; while such reductions were not significantly different between groups. Means of SBP reduction from baseline to the end of study were -11.5\u00b18.5 and -13.7\u00b17.6 mmHg in Olive and Captopril groups, respectively; and those of DBP were -4.8\u00b15.5 and -6.4\u00b15.2 mmHg, respectively. A significant reduction of triglyceride level was observed in Olive group, but not in Captopril group. In conclusion, Olive (Olea europaea) leaf extract, at the dosage regimen of 500 mg twice daily, was similarly effective in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressures in subjects with stage-1 hypertension as Captopril, given at its effective dose of 12.5-25 mg twice daily.", 
    "141": "Oxidative stress is important factor underlying in a variety of diseases. Antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) are part of the physiological defenses against oxidative stress. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a lipid peroxidation biomarker and its elevated level in various diseases is related to free radical damage. Cysteamine is a cytotoxic agent, acting through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and may decrease defense activity of antioxidative enzymes against ROS and induce duodenal ulcer. Captopril, acts as free radical scavengers and protect against injuries from oxidative damage to tissues.The aim of this study was the evaluation of the effect of captopril against cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer by determining duodenal damage, duodenal tissue SOD and GSH-PX activities and plasma MAD level. This study was performed on 3 groups of 7 rats each: saline, cysteamine and cysteamine plus captopril treated groups. The effect of captopril against cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer is determined by evaluating the duodenal damage, duodenal tissue SOD and GSH-PX activities and plasma MDA level. All animals were euthanized 24h after the last treatment and 2 ml blood and duodena samples were collected for calculation of ulcer index, histopathological assessment and measurement of tissue SOD, GSH-PX activities and plasma MDA level. Cysteamine produced severe duodenal damage, decreased the activity of duodenal tissue SOD and GSH-PX and increased the plasma MDA level compared with saline pretreated rats. Pretreatment with captopril decreased the cysteamine-induced duodenal damage and plasma level of MDA and increased the activities of SOD and GSH-PX in duodenal tissue compared with cysteamine pretreated animal. Our results suggest that captopril protects against cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer and inhibits the decrease in SOD and GSH-PX activities and lipid peroxidation by increasing antioxidant defenses.",

Hypertension, diabetes and renal failure are the most frequent comorbidities. They worsen the prognosis of heart failure, so their management should be precise. In all these situations, besides the specific treatment of the disease, the use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system is imperative, due to their proven efficacy in heart failure but also because they have beneficial effects on these co-morbidities. However, their use must be strictly monitored, clinically and biologically. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, beta-blockers can be tried and their dose adjusted according to clinical tolerance; they are contraindicated in patients with asthma. Finally, and especially in older patients, the risk of drugs interactions is harmful and should be constantly looking for.",

We sought to evaluate the differences in treatment patterns and attainment of guideline-recommended targets among high-risk vascular outpatients in relation to their body mass index (BMI). The prospective Vascular Protection and Guideline Orientated Approach to Lipid Lowering Registries recruited 7,357 high-risk vascular outpatients in Canada from 2001 to 2004. We stratified the patient population into 3 groups according to their BMI: normal weight (BMI <24.9 kg/m\u00b2), overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m\u00b2), and obese (BMI >30 kg/m\u00b2). We evaluated the rates of attainment for contemporary guideline targets of blood pressure (<140/90 or <130/80 mm Hg in the presence of diabetes) and lipids (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] <2.5 mmol/L [96.7 mg/dl] and total cholesterol [TC]/high-density lipoprotein [HDL] ratio <4.0). Of the 7,357 patients, 1,305 (17.7%) were normal weight, 2,791 (37.9%) overweight, and 3,261 (44.4%) obese, as determined by the BMI. Obese patients were younger and more likely to have hypertension and diabetes (all p <0.001 for trend). Obese patients had higher baseline blood pressure, TC, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride levels and TC/HDL ratio, and lower HDL cholesterol. Obese patients were more likely to be treated with antihypertensive agents (p = 0.002), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (p = 0.024), angiotensin receptor blockers (p <0.001), and high-dose statin therapy (p = 0.001). On multivariable analyses, obese patients were less likely to attain the blood pressure (odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.90, p = 0.001) and TC/HDL ratio (odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.55, p <0.001) targets but not the LDL targets (odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.03, p = 0.11). In conclusion, only a minority ambulatory patients at high cardiovascular risk achieved both guideline-recommended blood pressure and lipid targets, and this significant treatment gap was more pronounced among obese patients.

The authors pooled data from 12 randomized controlled trials of aliskiren in patients with hypertension and analyzed the incidence and types of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities. Studies were characterized as short-term (\u22642 months) placebo-controlled or long-term (>2 months) active-controlled. Relative risks for AEs of particular interest for RAS blockers were calculated. In short-term studies, AEs occurred in similar proportions of aliskiren 150 mg and 300 mg (33.6% and 31.6%, respectively) and placebo treatment groups (36.8%). In long-term studies, a lower proportion of patients treated with aliskiren 150 mg and 300 mg had AEs (33.7% and 43.2%, respectively) than those treated with ACE inhibitors (60.1%), angiotensin receptor blockers (53.9%), and thiazide diuretics (48.9%). Events of special interest, including angioedema, hyperkalemia, and diarrhea occurred in similar proportions of patients taking aliskiren, placebo, and comparator agents. In studies of up to 36 weeks, patients treated with aliskiren were significantly less likely to develop cough than those treated with ACE inhibitors. At the registered doses of 150 mg and 300 mg daily, aliskiren has safety and tolerability profiles similar to placebo, other RAS blockers, and diuretics.

Patient groups were selected homogeneously, i.e., only previously untreated patients amidst an urgent hypertensive episode and having no co-morbid disease were included-and randomly assigned to receive either captopril or nifedipine for immediate management. These two treatment groups were matched for age, gender, and mean arterial blood pressure.

Methods and Results. All subjects who gave informed consent for genetic research were divided into two groups: the subjects treated with azelnidipine or temocapril, for 52 weeks. We selected 18 susceptible genes for hypertension and determined their genotypes using TaqMan PCR method. RNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood, and quantitative real time PCR for all genes was performed using TaqMan method. One of the polymorphisms of the RGS2 gene was extracted as being able to influence the effect of these treatments to reduce BP. At eight weeks, BP change showed a significant interaction between the A-638G polymorphism of Regulator of G protein signaling-2 (RGS2) gene and treatment with azelnidipine or temocapril. There was no gene whose expression was associated with BP phenotypes or the polymorphisms of each gene. Conclusions. A-638G polymorphism of the RGS-2 gene could be a predictive factor for therapeutic performance of Ca channel blockers.",

With a double-blind, parallel-group design, the effects of 3 different combinations, carvedilol controlled-release (CR)/lisinopril, atenolol/lisinopril, and lisinopril, on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were assessed by MRI after 12 months. Patients were treated to achieve guideline-recommended BP (<140 mm Hg/<90 mm Hg; diabetes: <130 mm Hg/<80 mm Hg). Sample size was calculated to achieve 90% power to detect a 5 g/m(2) difference in mean change from baseline in LVMI between the carvedilol CR/lisinopril group and each of the other treatment groups. Of 287 patients randomized, more than 50% were titrated to maximum dosage; 73% reached targeted BP. At month 12 (last observation carried forward \u2265 month 9) for 195 evaluable subjects, mean BP was similar in all groups (carvedilol CR/lisinopril: 128.8/77.9; atenolol/lisinopril: 128.7/76.5; lisinopril: 126.3/80.3 mm Hg).

Despite advances in device therapy and surgery, the mainstay of treatment for these disorders remains pharmacological. Hypertension affects two-thirds of older adults and remains a potent risk factor for coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke in this age group. Numerous trials have demonstrated reduction in these adverse outcomes with antihypertensive drugs. After acute myocardial infarction, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers reduce mortality regardless of patient age. Statins and antiplatelet drugs have proven beneficial in both primary and, especially, secondary prevention of coronary events in older adults. In elders with chronic heart failure, loop diuretics must be used cautiously, owing to their higher potential for adverse effects, whereas angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers reduce symptoms and prolong survival. The high risk of stroke in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation is markedly reduced with warfarin, although bleeding risk is increased.

Only the highest doses of LPS (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) inhibited water intake induced by FURO/CAP. LPS (0.6 mg/kg) reduced urinary volume and sodium excretion, but had no effect on mean arterial pressure or heart rate of rats treated with FURO/CAP.

Superoxide produced by the nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, mitochondrial sources, or the xanthine oxidase may react with NO, thereby resulting in excessive formation of peroxynitrite, a reactive nitrogen species that has been demonstrated to accelerate the atherosclerotic process by causing direct structural damage and by causing further ROS production. Despite this sound biological rationale and a number of pre-clinical and clinical lines of evidence, studies testing the effects of classical antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, or folic acid in combination with vitamin E have been disappointing. Rather, substances such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or AT1-receptor blockers, which possess indirect antioxidant properties mediated by the stimulation of NO production and simultaneous inhibition of superoxide production (e.g. from the NADPH oxidase), have been shown to improve vascular function in pre-clinical and clinical studies and to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease.

In this document, the Hypertension Committee of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology provides new guidelines for hypertension management. The key messages are as follows. (1) The life-time risk for hypertension is 90%. (2) Both the increase in the prevalence rate and the relative risk of hypertension for causing cardiovascular events are higher in Asians than in Caucasians. (3) The control rate has been improved significantly in Taiwan from 2.4% to 21% in men, and from 5% to 29% in women in recent years (1995-2002). (4) Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) = 130/80 mmHg are thresholds of treatment for high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, stroke, established coronary heart disease, and coronary heart disease equivalents (carotid artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm). (5) Ambulatory and home BP monitoring correlate more closely with end-organ damage and have a stronger relationship with cardiovascular events than office BP monitoring, but the feasibility of home monitoring makes it a more attractive alternative. (6) Patients with masked hypertension have higher cardiovascular risk than those with white-coat hypertension. (7) Lifestyle changes should be encouraged in all patients, and include the following six items: S-ABCDE (Salt restriction; Alcohol limitation; Body weight reduction; Cessation of smoking; Diet adaptation; Exercise adoption). (8) When pharmacological therapy is needed, physicians should consider \"PROCEED\" (Previous experience of patient; Risk factors; Organ damage; Contraindication or unfavorable conditions; Expert or doctor judgment; Expense or cost; Delivery and compliance) to decide the optimal treatment. (9) The main benefits of antihypertensive agents are derived from lowering of BP per se, and are generally independent of the drugs being used, except that certain associated cardiovascular conditions might favor certain classes of drugs. (10) There are five major classes of drugs: thiazide diuretics; \u03b2-blockers; calcium channel blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs); and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Any one of these can be used as the initial treatment, except for \u03b2-blockers, which are only indicated in patients with heart failure, a history of coronary heart disease, and hyperadrenergic state. (11) A standard dose of any one of the five major classes of antihypertensive drugs can produce an \u223c10-mmHg decrease in systolic BP (rule of 10) and a 5-mmHg decrease in diastolic BP (rule of 5), after placebo subtraction. (11) Combination therapy is frequently needed for optimal control of BP, and the amount of the decrease in BP by a two-drug combination is approximately the same as the sum of the decrease by each individual drug (\u223c20 mmHg in systolic BP and 10 mmHg in diastolic BP) if their mechanisms of action are independent, with the exception of the combination of ACEIs and ARBs. (13) An ACEI or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic (A + C or A + D) are reasonable two-drug combinations, and A+C + D is a reasonable three-drug combination, unless patients have special indications for \u03b2-blockers. (14) Single-pill (fixed-dose) combinations that contain more than one drug in a single tablet are highly recommended because they reduce pill burden and cost, and improve compliance. (15) Very elderly patients (> 80 years) should be treated without delay, but BP should be reduced gradually and more cautiously. Finally, these guidelines are not mandatory; the responsible physician's decision remains most important in hypertension management.", 
    "245": "Arterial hypertension (HT), being the main factor of negative evolution for chronic nephropathies, has imposed a careful adjustment of pharmacological treatment. The widespread use of angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) has brought into attention the side effects of this class of antihypertensive drugs. The study focuses on the clinical and paraclinical evaluation of these elements, by means of detecting variations in serum creatinine, natriuresis and diuresis levels factors. In addition, cardiac cavity measurements have been made and the results have lead to the conclusion that the decision to administer ACE inhibitors has to be well founded, and patients should be closely monitored in order to prevent complications of the primary disease.", 
    "246": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a modulator of various physiological and pathological processes in the cardiovascular and nervous system and plays an important role in the regulation of gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney function. The effect of the pleiotropic action of the tissue specific angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), ramipril, exceeds renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade and involves different biological mechanisms. The aim of the study is to assess the influence of ramipril on H2S production in mouse liver and kidneys. Thirty mice (CBA) of both sexes were given intraperitoneal injections of ramipril solutions--0.125 mg (5 mg/kg--group D1) and 0.25 mg (10 mg/kg--group D2) for 5 consecutive days at the same time of the day (10:30 am). The control group received physiological saline in portions of the same volume--0.2 ml. The measurements of the tissue concentration of H2S were performed using the modified spectrophotometric method of Siegel. There was a significant rise in the tissue concentration of H2S [microg/g] in livers of group D1 (2.70 +/- 0.02 vs 2.81 +/- 0.06; P = 0.03) and group D2 (2.70 +/- 0.02 vs 2.98 +/- 0.03; P < 0.001) and a significant decrease of H2S kidney tissue concentration in group D1 (3.35 +/- 0.06 vs 3.15 +/- 0.07; P = 0.02) and in group D2 (3.35 +/- 0.06 vs 2.89 +/- 0.03; P < 0.001). Our results show that ACEI ramipril affects hydrogen sulfide generation in mouse liver and kidneys.", 
    "247": "Our previous studies showed that chronic ethanol feeding attenuates centrally (clonidine) evoked and potentiates peripherally (hydralazine) evoked hypotension in female rats. In this study, we investigated whether chronic ethanol (8 weeks, 5% wt/vol) alters hemodynamic responses elicited by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (enalapril) in telemetered female rats. Given the intimate interaction between ACE and bradykinin, studies were extended to investigate the role of bradykinin receptor (B2R) in ethanol-enalapril interaction. Compared with pair-fed controls, ethanol-fed female rats exhibited (1) higher renal expressions of ACE and B2R proteins and angiotensin II levels and (2) lower blood pressure. Pharmacological inhibition of ACE and B2R supports functional role for the higher levels of these 2 proteins in ethanol-fed rats because enalapril (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) caused significantly greater hypotensive response in ethanol-fed rats than in control rats. Further, blockade of B2R with bradyzide (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) abrogated the enhanced hypotensive effect of enalapril in ethanol-fed rats but had no effect on enalapril-evoked hypotension in control rats. Finally, enalapril enhancement of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in control was absent in ethanol-fed rats. These findings demonstrate that chronic ethanol produces B2R-dependent enhancement of the hypotensive response elicited by enalapril and abrogates enalapril-evoked enhancement of spontaneous baroreflex response in female rats.", 
    "248": "We examined the relationship between the efficacy of combined treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) plus enalapril for maintaining sinus rhythm and circadian variation in the onset of paroxysmal AF.Three hundred and forty-four patients with paroxysmal AF (239 men, mean age, 69 \u00b1 11 years) who could be followed up \u2265 12 months were divided into 3 groups on the basis of circadian variation in the onset of AF: a diurnal group (7:00 AM-5:00 PM, n = 57), a nocturnal group (5:00 PM-7:00 AM, n = 108), and a mixed group (onset during both periods, n = 169). The maintenance rate of sinus rhythm during the follow-up period was compared between combined therapy (AAD plus enalapril) and AAD alone.In the diurnal group, the maintenance rates of sinus rhythm at 12, 36, 60, and 90 months were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, for patients treated with AAD plus enalapril (n = 22) versus 97%, 91%, 89%, and 80% for patients treated with AAD alone (n = 35, P < 0.05). In the nocturnal group, the maintenance rates of sinus rhythm at 12, 36, 60, and 90 months were 96%, 96%, 96%, and 92%, respectively, in patients treated with AAD plus enalapril (n = 24) versus 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% in patients treated with AAD alone (n = 84, P = NS). In the mixed group, maintenance rates of sinus rhythm at 12, 36, 60, and 90 months were 90%, 71%, 61%, and 57%, respectively, in patients treated with AAD plus enalapril (n = 49) versus 88%, 78%, 68%, and 61% in patients treated with AAD alone (n = 120, P = NS). Our findings suggest that the preventive efficacy of combined therapy with AAD plus enalapril is dependent on the timing of onset of paroxysmal AF, and this regimen seems to be most beneficial for the diurnal type of paroxysmal AF.", 
    "249": "Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) has emerged as a new factor in mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease (CKD). An important regulator of phosphorus homeostasis, FGF-23 has been shown to independently predict CKD progression in nondiabetic renal disease. We analyzed the relation between FGF-23 and renal outcome in diabetic nephropathy (DN).", 
    "250": "DN patients participating in a clinical trial (enalapril+placebo versus enalapril+losartan) had baseline data collected and were followed until June 2009 or until the primary outcome was reached. Four patients were lost to follow-up. The composite primary outcome was defined as death, doubling of serum creatinine, and/or dialysis need.", 
    "251": "At baseline, serum FGF-23 showed a significant association with serum creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria, urinary fractional excretion of phosphate, male sex, and race. Interestingly, FGF-23 was not related to calcium, phosphorus, 25OH-vitamin D, or 24-hour urinary phosphorus. Mean follow-up time was 30.7\u00b110 months. Cox regression showed that FGF-23 was an independent predictor of the primary outcome, even after adjustment for creatinine clearance and intact parathyroid hormone (10 pg/ml FGF-23 increase = hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.16, P=0.02). Finally, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly higher risk of the primary outcome in patients with FGF-23 values of >70 pg/ml.", 
    "252": "FGF-23 is a significant independent predictor of renal outcome in patients with macroalbuminuric DN. Further studies should clarify whether this relation is causal and whether FGF-23 should be a new therapeutic target for CKD prevention.", 
    "253": "Agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are the cornerstones of antihypertensive therapy in patients at high risk for cardiovascular or renal disease. Recently, it was shown that activation of RAAS may occur through alternate pathways not inhibited by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and that ACEIs, ARBs, or MRAs may actually cause a reactive increase in plasma renin concentration and activity. While these agents, alone or in combination, decrease blood pressure and cardiovascular events to varying degrees, the direct renin inhibitor is a new class of RAAS blocking agent. Aliskiren is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved direct renin inhibitor with good oral bioavailability. ASPIRE HIGHER is an ongoing series of clinical trials designed to investigate the effect of aliskiren on cardiovascular/renal surrogate endpoints and morbidity/mortality in patients with hypertension and high risk for cardiovascular or renal disease.", 
    "254": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) activity was evaluated and compared in <3 KDa water-soluble extracts (WSE) isolated from milk fermented by wild and commercial starter culture Lactococcus lactis strains after 48 h of incubation. The highest ACEI activities were found in WSE from milk inoculated with wild L. lactis strains isolated from artisanal dairy products and commercial starter cultures. On the other hand, the lowest ACEI activities were found in WSE from milk inoculated with wild strains isolated from vegetables. Moreover, the IC(50) values (concentration that inhibits 50% activity) of WSE from artisanal dairy products were the lowest, indicating that these fractions were the most effective in inhibiting 50% of ACE activity. In fact, a strain isolated from artisanal cheese presented the lowest IC(50) (13 \u03bcg/mL). Thus, it appears that wild L. lactis strains isolated from artisanal dairy products and commercial starter cultures showed good potential for the production of fermented dairy products with ACEI properties.",

Low nINC was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving \u03b2-blockers (0.93, 0.87-0.98) and a higher likelihood of receiving ACE inhibitors (1.13, 1.04-1.22), compared to high nINC. Patients with Medicaid coverage were less likely to receive aspirin (0.92, 0.87-0.98), compared to patients without Medicaid coverage. These findings were independent of other key covariates.",

    "259": "The anti-hypertensive drug captopril is used commonly to reduce blood pressure of patients with severe forms of Chagas disease, a cardiomyopathy caused by chronic infection with the intracellular protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Captopril acts by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the vasopressor metallopeptidase that generates angiotensin II and promotes the degradation of bradykinin (BK). Recent studies in mice models of Chagas disease indicated that captopril can potentiate the T helper type 1 (Th1)-directing natural adjuvant property of BK. Equipped with kinin-releasing cysteine proteases, T. cruzi trypomastigotes were shown previously to invade non-professional phagocytic cells, such as human endothelial cells and murine cardiomyocytes, through the signalling of G protein-coupled bradykinin receptors (B(2) KR). Monocytes are also parasitized by T. cruzi and these cells are known to be important for the host immune response during infection. Here we showed that captopril increases the intensity of T. cruzi infection of human monocytes in vitro. The increased parasitism was accompanied by up-regulated expression of ACE in human monocytes. While T. cruzi infection increased the expression of interleukin (IL)-10 by monocytes significantly, compared to uninfected cells, T. cruzi infection in association with captopril down-modulated IL-10 expression by the monocytes. Surprisingly, studies with peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that addition of the ACE inhibitor in association with T. cruzi increased expression of IL-17 by CD4(+) T cells in a B(2) KR-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest that captopril might interfere with host-parasite equilibrium by enhancing infection of monocytes, decreasing the expression of the modulatory cytokine IL-10, while guiding development of the proinflammatory Th17 subset.",

Echocardiography during hospitalization revealed normal left ventricular (LV) function in 66.1%, mild LV dysfunction in 14.5%, moderate LV dysfunction in 10.5% and severe LV dysfunction in 8.9%. Predischarge exercise testing was performed in 64.1% of patients and was normal in 85.4%, abnormal in 13.4% and inconclusive in 1.2%. Only 3.9% underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging, which was positive for ischemia in 60% and negative in 40%. Elective catheterization was performed in 22.7% of patients; 44.9% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and 6.9% were referred for cardiac surgery. Medication prescribed at discharge was as follows: aspirin 97.7%, beta-blockers 90.6%, statins 84.4%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 50% and clopidogrel 25%. Arrhythmias were the main complication of ACS and no deaths occurred during hospitalization.",

Whether these interventions can also prevent IR-induced impairment of endothelial function in humans has not been investigated. We performed 2 separate double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies. In the first study, 10 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive oral amiloride (10 mg) or a placebo. In a separate study, another group of volunteers (n = 10) was randomized to receive oral captopril (50 mg) or a placebo. At the time of the peak hemodynamic effect of the drug (3 and 1.5 h after administration of amiloride and captopril, respectively), endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilatation of the radial artery was measured before and after IR. IR significantly blunted flow-mediated dilatation in all groups (placebo: pre-IR: 6.8% \u00b1 0.7%; post-IR: 2.9% \u00b1 0.9%; P < 0.01; amiloride: pre-IR: 5.9% \u00b1 0.6%; post-IR: 2.1% \u00b1 1.3%; P = 0.01; captopril: pre-IR: 6.0% \u00b1 0.5%; post-IR: 2.0% \u00b1 0.6%; P < 0.01).

We either assumed that past trends in model parameters (incidence, discontinuation and drug user mortality) would continue during 2006-2015, or that all model parameters would remain unchanged at their values in 2005. Yearly drug expenditure per user of a particular drug was assumed to remain unchanged.

Aldosterone receptor blockade has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in human patients with advanced congestive left ventricular heart failure. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerance of long-term low-dose spironolactone when added to conventional heart failure treatment in dogs with advanced heart failure. Eighteen client-owned dogs with advanced congestive heart failure due to either degenerative valve disease (n=11) or dilated cardiomyopathy (n=7) were included in this prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical study. After initial stabilization including furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, pimobendan and digoxin, spironolactone at a median dose of 0.52 mg/kg (range 0.49-0.8 mg/kg) once daily (n=9) or placebo (n=9) was added to the treatment, and the dogs were reassessed 3 and 6 months later. Clinical scoring, echocardiography, electrocardiogram, systolic blood pressure measurement, thoracic radiography, sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aldosterone and aminoterminal atrial natriuretic propeptide were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months.

Usual pharmacotherapy was observed for 8 months in two different outpatient healthcare settings in Berlin [11 family physicians from individual GP (IGP) practices and 12 working in a medical care centre (MCC)]. Medical care centres provide a novel structure for outpatient care and have recently been introduced in Germany. The subsequent intervention entailed implementation of heart failure guidelines via a computer-based reminder system, followed by renewed cross-sectional observation of prescription behaviour for 1 year. Family physicians recruited patients, assessed CHF severity according to the NYHA class, and referred patients for echocardiography. The study included 190 patients in the baseline phase and 209 in the intervention phase. Longitudinal follow-up was performed in 172 cases. Echocardiography was ordered by 94.6% of MCC-physicians and 79.9% of IGP's. Undermedication was observed in both settings. Guideline-based beta-blocker therapy was prescribed for 46.3% of patients (44.8% of IGPs and 48.5% of MCC-GPs). Prescription improved by 12.3% after the intervention.

Spironolactone, a potent antifibrotic agent, is currently used for advanced heart failure. Therapies such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) also have antifibrotic properties. However, the effect of these medications on the ventricular arrhythmia phenotype is currently unknown. Therefore, we set out to define the ventricular arrhythmia rates in patients actively treated with such therapies.",

In addition, we observed that VT rates showed a significant trend toward lower rates in patients receiving either statins or ACEi, compared to patients on no medical therapy. In multivariate analysis, spironolactone therapy was identified as the single most significant variable for reduced VT rate.",

Similar but less-significant reductions in VT rates were observed with use of other pharmacological agents with antifibrotic properties, such as statins and ACEi.

    "301": "Major complications associated with cardiac surgery are still common and carry great prognostic significance. Current medical interventions to prevent these cardiovascular complications include antiplatelet therapy, statins, \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Both experimental studies and clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibitors hold promise as cardiovascular protective agents for cardiac surgery patients. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, long-term use of ACE inhibitors has been well established to provide cardiovascular protection and reduce ischemic events and complications, independent of their effect on heart function and blood pressure. Second, early ACE inhibitor therapy has been demonstrated to produce remarkable survival and heart function benefits in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Third, ACE blockage can prevent or delay the development or progression of renal disease at all stages, from subclinical microalbuminuria to end-stage renal disease. Nevertheless, perioperative studies of the effects of ACE inhibitors remain few and inconclusive. Results from recent clinical trials and observational studies are conflicting and raise more questions than answers. Further studies, both retrospective and larger-scale prospective studies, are critically needed to examine whether ACE inhibitors reduce mortality and major complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.", 
    "302": "Greater insight into vascular pathophysiology and intimal hyperplasia has resulted in observational studies that suggest that interventions which decrease inflammatory mediators, improve endothelial function and inhibit smooth muscle migration and proliferation may be of benefit in improving hemodialysis vascular access survival. Longer dialysis times may also reduce inflammatory mediators and restore vascular sensitivity to endothelium dependent relaxation factor. In contrast, the common procedure of angioplasty is the experimental model to develop intimal hyperplasia and stenosis, while the efficacy of stents to prevent that stenosis in hemodialysis accesses remains controversial. Common drugs that interfere with metalloproteinases may prevent aneurysm formation while avoiding drugs that aid quorum sensing and using drugs that interfere with it may prevent biofilm infection in hemodialysis vascular catheters. Large prospective randomized studies will be needed to determine the true benefit.",

We aimed to test whether disparities in medical treatment of cardiovascular conditions, specifically receipt of medical procedures and receipt of prescribed medication, are linked with elevated rates of mortality in people with schizophrenia and severe mental illness. We undertook a systematic review of studies that examined medical procedures and a pooled analysis of prescribed medication in those with and without comorbid mental illness, focusing on those which recruited individuals with schizophrenia and measured mortality as an outcome. From 17 studies of treatment adequacy in cardiovascular conditions, eight examined cardiac procedures and nine examined adequacy of prescribed cardiac medication. Six of eight studies examining the adequacy of cardiac procedures found lower than average provision of medical care and two studies found no difference. Meta-analytic pooling of nine medication studies showed lower than average rates of prescribing evident for the following individual classes of medication; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 6, aOR = 0.779, 95% CI = 0.638-0.950, p = 0.0137), beta-blockers (n = 9, aOR = 0.844, 95% CI = 0.690-1.03, p = 0.1036) and statins (n = 5, aOR = 0.604, 95% CI = 0.408-0.89, p = 0.0117). No inequality was evident for aspirin (n = 7, aOR = 0.986, 95% CI = 0.7955-1.02, p = 0.382). Interestingly higher than expected prescribing was found for older non-statin cholesterol-lowering agents (n = 4, aOR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.04-2.32, p = 0.0312). A search for outcomes in this sample revealed ten studies linking poor quality of care and possible effects on mortality in specialist settings. In half of the studies there was significantly higher mortality in those with mental ill health compared with controls but there was inadequate data to confirm a causative link. Nevertheless, indirect evidence supports the observation that deficits in quality of care are contributing to higher than expected mortality in those with severe mental illness (SMI) and schizophrenia. The quality of medical treatment provided to those with cardiac conditions and comorbid schizophrenia is often suboptimal and may be linked with avoidable excess mortality. Every effort should be made to deliver high-quality medical care to people with severe mental illness.",

In Fabry patients, progressive renal failure is frequently treated with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We were interested in the possible interactions between ACE inhibitors therapy and the only causative therapy for Fabry disease, the enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant human \u03b1-GalA (rh\u03b1-GalA). Our results suggest that ACE activity was significantly inhibited in plasma of Fabry patients and the blood pressure level decreased just after ERT (at the end of the rh\u03b1-GalA infusion). Interestingly, 2 weeks later, ACE activity was significantly upregulated and the plasma levels of angiotensin II increased in the patients treated with rh\u03b1-GalA following the elevations of ACE activity. The same inhibitory effect on ACE activity was also observed in rats after rh\u03b1-GalA infusion. Furthermore, ACE activity in CHO cells transfected with the human ACE was inhibited dose and time-dependently by rh\u03b1-GalA. In vitro, the incubation of plasma from healthy volunteers with rh\u03b1-GalA significantly reduced ACE activity. Finally, rh\u03b1-GalA also inhibited ACE activity and released galactose residues from purified rabbit lung ACE dose-dependently. In summary, our results suggest that rh\u03b1-GalA interacts with ACE and inhibits its activity, possibly by removing the galactose residues from the enzyme. This modulation might have profound impact on the clinical outcome of Fabry patients treated with rh\u03b1-GalA.",

The descriptors were then applied to study on quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) of nine peptide datasets of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-inhibitor) oligopeptides (between dipeptides and decapeptides) by using partial least square (PLS) regression. The multiple correlation coefficients (R\u00b2) and leave one out cross validation values (Q\u00b2) of PLS models are better than or close to the results of references.

    "306": "Arterial stiffness has been known as a sign of cardiovascular risk since the 19th century. Despite this, accurate measurement and clinical utility have only emerged in recent times. Arterial stiffness and its hemodynamic consequences are now established as predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcome. They are easily and reliably measured using a range of noninvasive techniques, which can be used readily by risk assessment facilities or individual practitioners. The techniques described in this review are based on the pulsatility of the cardiovascular system, utilizing the timing of pulse travel along major arteries and the magnitude of wave reflection. These have enabled better understanding of the ill effects of arterial stiffening, not only on large arteries and the left ventricle, but also on tiny arteries in highly perfused organs such as brain and kidneys. Treatment options, which directly target the consequences of arterial stiffening, as opposed to arbitrary reduction of brachial blood pressure, have proved clinical superiority; optimal therapy entails use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium-channel blockers, as well as vasodilating \u03b2-blockers. Arterial stiffness will undoubtedly contribute to cardiovascular assessment and management in future clinical practice. Reviews such as this will hopefully increase awareness of the mounting evidence underlying this transition, and the relevant theory and methodology. As we begin the second decade of the 21st century, we are finally collectively coming to realize what pioneers such as Osler, Roy, Bramwell and Hill foresaw in the 19th and 20th centuries.",

Hyperglycaemia stimulates the angiotensin AT1-receptor and downstream chains of events resulting in diabetic end organ damage. Pharmacological RAS inhibition may thus be a beneficial therapeutic strategy in the management of diabetic retinopathy. The present review article details therapeutic RAS inhibition in diabetic retinopathy with an emphasis on recently published evidence.

This analysis examined medication usage among Fontan patients by putative indication and by study center. The medical history and current medications of 546 Fontan subjects, ages 6-18\u00a0years, were assessed in a Pediatric Heart Network multicenter cross-sectional study. Cardiac imaging was performed within 3\u00a0months of enrollment. The majority of the subjects (64%) were taking two or more medications. Antithrombotics were taken by 86% of those with a history of stroke, thrombosis, or both and 67% of those without such a history (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Conversely, 14% of those with a history of stroke, thrombosis, or both were taking no antithrombotic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy was independently associated with moderate or severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), right ventricular morphology (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and shorter time since Fontan (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) but not with ventricular systolic dysfunction.

    "314": "Gene targeting in ES cells was used to substitute control of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) expression from the endogenous promoter to the mouse c-fms promoter. The result is an animal model called ACE 10/10 in which ACE is overexpressed by monocytes, macrophages, and other myelomonocytic lineage cells. To study the immune response of these mice to bacterial infection, we challenged them with Listeria monocytogenes or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). ACE 10/10 mice have a significantly enhanced immune response to both bacteria in vivo and in vitro. For example, 5 days after Listeria infection, the spleen and liver of ACE 10/10 mice had 8.0- and 5.2-fold less bacteria than wild type mice (WT). In a model of MRSA skin infection, ACE 10/10 mice had 50-fold less bacteria than WT mice. Histologic examination showed a prominent infiltrate of ACE-positive mononuclear cells in the skin lesions from ACE 10/10. Increased bacterial resistance in ACE 10/10 is directly due to overexpression of ACE, as it is eliminated by an ACE inhibitor. Critical to increased immunity in ACE 10/10 is the overexpression of iNOS and reactive nitrogen intermediates, as inhibition of iNOS by the inhibitor 1400W eliminated all in vitro and in vivo differences in innate bacterial resistance between ACE 10/10 and WT mice. Increased resistance to MRSA was transferable by bone marrow transplantation. The overexpression of ACE and iNOS by myelomonocytic cells substantially boosts innate immunity and may represent a new means to address serious bacterial infections.",

Different clinics report shifting frequencies for both the causes of chronic cough and the success of treatment. However, after all evaluations, differential diagnosis still leaves a group of patients with unexplained cough. This unexplained cough is also known as chronic idiopathic cough (CIC), though there are widely varying opinions as to its existence. Among patients previously diagnosed with CIC, a subgroup has been identified with both upper and lower airway symptoms, including cough induced by odours and chemicals, and with increased cough sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin, which is known to stimulate the airway sensory nerves. A suggested explanation for this condition is a hyperreactivity of the sensory nerves of the entire airways, and hence the condition is known as sensory hyperreactivity (SHR).

    "316": "The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in regulation of blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte homeostasis. The renin-angiotensin system consists of a cascade of enzymatic reactions producing angiotensin II (Ang II). Ang II is a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone that exerts a wide variety of physiological actions on cardiovascular, renal, endocrine and central nervous systems. The RAS can be inhibited at various points to control pathogenesis of hypertension. Renin inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were the earliest RAS blocking agents. A relatively new class of compounds known as Ang II receptor antagonists (SARTANs) is developed for the treatment of hypertension. They exert their action by blocking the binding of Ang II on AT(1) receptor. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are associated with incident of side effects such as cough and angioedema while clinical trials with Ang II receptor antagonists have confirmed that these drugs are safe and efficacious for the treatment of hypertension. Based upon the understanding of molecular interaction of Ang II receptor antagonists with AT(1) receptor some of the common structural features have been identified, such as a heterocyclic (nitrogen atom) ring system, an alkyl side chain and an acidic tetrazole group. Research efforts for development of new molecules with similar structural features have led to the discovery of various non-peptidic Ang II receptor antagonists with different substituted heterocyclic such as imidazole (losartan) and benzimidazole (candesartan and telmisartan). In this study we have critically reviewed various benzimidazole substituted compounds as Ang II-AT(1) receptor antagonists and explored other potential clinical uses for this class of compounds.",

To describe the methodology of a study designed to determine whether systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients with incident scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prior to the onset of SRC have worse outcomes. Methods. Prospective, international cohort study of SRC subjects identified through an ongoing web-based survey. Every second Friday afternoon, an e-mail was sent to 589 participating physicians to identify new cases of SRC. Death or dialysis at one year after the onset of SRC will be compared in patients exposed or not to ACE inhibitors prior to the onset of SRC. Results. Fifteen months after the start of the survey, we had identified 76 incident cases of SRC. Of these, 66 (87%) had a hypertensive SRC and 10 (13%) a normotensive SRC. Twenty-two percent (22%) of the patients were on an ACE inhibitor immediately prior to the onset of the SRC. To date, we have collected one-year follow-up data on approximately 1/3 of the cohort.

It is usually accepted that endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress and estrogen deficiency are the main reasons of CSX. There are some methods to treat CSX including statins, b blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nitrates, estrogen, and so on. The estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), in particular, has been reported by many researchers to significantly reduce the frequency of chest pain after administration of estrogen, which has been explained as estrogen acting on its receptor to improve the endothelial function. However, it has been suggested that ERT must not be used for coronary heart disease due to its adverse effects. However, some selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) can inhibit inflammatory response as well as oxidative stress, and improve the endothelial function, to reduce the occurrence of chest pain. Here, we hypothesize that SERMs may be the beneficial selection for patients with CSX.",

    "327": "Hypertension is associated with heightened cardiac sympathetic drive whilst statins reduce angiotensin II (ATII) signalling, superoxide anion production and increase nitric oxide bioavailability, events that can potentially reduce peripheral cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission. We therefore investigated whether pravastatin alters peripheral cardiac sympathetic control in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). SHRs (16-18 weeks) had significantly (p<0.05) enhanced atrial (3)H-norepinephrine ((3)H-NE) release to field stimulation compared to normotensive WKYs. 2-week pravastatin supplementation significantly reduced (3)H-NE release to levels observed in the WKY. In-vivo, pravastatin lowered resting heart rate (HR) in the SHR despite not affecting arterial blood pressure or serum cholesterol. In SHR atria/right stellate ganglion preparations, the HR response to stellate stimulation (1, 3, and 5 Hz) was also significantly reduced by pravastatin whilst the HR response to exogenous NE (0.025-5 \u03bcmol) remained similar. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NAME (1 mmol/l) increased (3)H-NE release by similar amounts in atria from supplemented and non-supplemented SHRs, whilst Western blotting showed no difference in protein levels of nNOS, eNOS, guanylyl cyclase, or the NADPH oxidase subunits Gp91 and P40 phox. Pravastatin significantly reduced cardiac ATII levels and angiotensin converting enzyme 1 and 2 expressions whilst protein levels of the ATII receptor (ATR(1)) remained unchanged in the SHR. Immunohistochemistry co-localised ATR(1) with tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the stellate ganglion. The ATR(1) antagonist Losartan (5 \u03bcmol) equalised release of (3)H-NE to comparable levels in supplemented and non-supplemented SHRs. These results suggest 2-week pravastatin treatment reduces cardiac ATII, and prevents its facilitatory effect on NE release thus normalising cardiac sympathetic hyper-responsiveness in SHRs.",

This component of the system acts to oppose the vasoconstrictor and proliferative effects on angiotensin II through signaling mechanisms mediated by the mas receptor. In addition, a reduced expression of the vasodepressor axis composed by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin-(1-7) may contribute to the expression of essential hypertension, the remodeling of heart and renal function associated with this disease, and even the physiology of pregnancy and the development of eclampsia.",

Neonatal inhibition of the RAS in rats results in long-term pathological renal phenotype and causes hyaluronan (HA), which is involved in morphogenesis and inflammation, to accumulate. To elucidate the mechanisms, intrarenal HA content was followed during neonatal completion of nephrogenesis with or without angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) together with mRNA expression of hyaluronan synthases (HAS), hyaluronidases (Hyal), urinary hyaluronidase activity and cortical lymphatic vessels, which facilitate the drainage of HA from the tissue. In 6-8days old control rats cortical HA content was high and reduced by 93% on days 10-21, reaching adult low levels. Medullary HA content was high on days 6-8 and then reduced by 85% to 12-fold above cortical levels at day 21. In neonatally ACEI-treated rats the reduction in HA was abolished. Temporal expression of HAS2 corresponded with the reduction in HA content in the normal kidney. In ACEI-treated animals cortical HAS2 remained twice the expression of controls. Medullary Hyal1 increased in controls but decreased in ACEI-treated animals. Urine hyaluronidase activity decreased with time in control animals while in ACEI-treated animals it was initially 50% lower and did not change over time. Cells expressing the lymphatic endothelial mucoprotein podoplanin in ACEI-treated animals were increased 18-fold compared to controls suggesting compensation. In conclusion, the high renal HA content is rapidly reduced due to reduced HAS2 and increased Hyal1 mRNA expressions. Normal angiotensin II function is crucial for inducing these changes. Due to the extreme water-attracting and pro-inflammatory properties of HA, accumulation in the neonatally ACEI-treated kidneys may partly explain the pathological renal phenotype of the adult kidney, which include reduced urinary concentration ability and tubulointerstitial inflammation.",

Anesthetized dogs were used to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of FEPR. The determination of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in vitro and plasma renin activity (PRA) and endothelin (ET) in vivo were used to study the pilot mechanism of FEPR. Moreover, the toxicity study of FEPR was evaluated.", 
    "332": "FEPR (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, i.v.) notably reduced the blood pressure of SHRs in a short time period. A two-week administration of FEPR (45, 90 and 180 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased the blood pressure of both 2K1C rats and SHRs. The results of hemodynamic study in anesthetized dogs showed that, left ventricular end systolic pressure and left ventricular dP/dt(max) had shown no significant difference between FEPR-treated dogs and those from the control group, while the cerebral blood flow increased significantly in FEPR-treated groups. FEPR significantly inhibited the ACE activities in vitro dose dependently, and inhibited the PRA in vivo, while the content of ET showed no difference in the FEPR treated group comparing with the control group.",

    "334": "Management of systolic heart failure can be particularly challenging in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those who are not yet receiving dialysis. Few clinical trials have been performed in this particular population, so management is directed by evidence from studies of patients with limited or no renal impairment. Their heightened risk for many treatment complications mandates additional considerations regarding drug selection, dosing, and monitoring. Subspecialty consultation is driven by patient instability or disease progression, intolerance of standard treatment, or need for device placement.", 
    "335": "Blood pressure (BP) control is frequently difficult to achieve in patients with predominantly elevated systolic BP. Consequently, these patients frequently require combination therapy including a thiazide diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and an agent blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Current clinical practice usually limits the daily dose of HCTZ to 25 mg. This often leads to the necessity of using additional antihypertensive agents to control BP in a high proportion of patients.",

    "340": "Specific features of the 24 h-blood pressure (BP) pattern are linked to the progressive injury of target tissues and risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Studies have consistently shown an association between blunted asleep BP decline and increased incidence of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Thus, there is growing interest in how to achieve better BP control during nighttime sleep in addition to during daytime activity, according to the particular requirements of each hypertension patient. One approach takes into consideration the endogenous circadian rhythm-determinants of the 24-h BP pattern, especially, the prominent day-night variation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which activates during nighttime sleep. A series of clinical studies have demonstrated a different effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors benazepril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, spirapril, and trandolapril when routinely ingested in the morning vs. the evening. In most cases, the evening schedule exerts a more marked effect on the asleep than awake BP means. Similarly, a once-daily evening, in comparison to morning, ingestion schedule of the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) irbesartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan exerts greater therapeutic effect on asleep BP, plus significant increase in the sleep-time relative BP decline, with normalization of the circadian BP profile toward a more dipping pattern, independent of drug terminal half-life. Chronotherapy, the timing of treatment to body rhythms, is a cost-effective means of both individualizing and optimizing the treatment of hypertension through normalization of the 24-h BP level and profile, and it may constitute an effective option to reduce cardiovascular risk.", 
    "341": "Acromegaly is characterized by chronic hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH) and is associated with increased mortality rate because of the potential complications such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, or malignancy, which are probably caused by the long-term exposure of tissues to excess GH, for at least 10 years, before diagnosis and treatment. A 22-year-old man with a 2-month history of fatigue was admitted to our hospital because of chest discomfort, dyspnea, and pitting edema of the lower limbs experienced over a 1-month period. On admission, his height and body weight were 186 cm and 138.5 kg, respectively, with a BMI of 39.8 kg/m(2). He showed acromegalic features and elevated serum GH and IGF-1 levels, which were 11.5 ng/mL and 960 ng/mL, respectively. There was no GH suppression in the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed microadenoma. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly, and echocardiogram showed dilated left ventricular (LV) cavity and diffuse hypokinesis with extremely decreased ejection fraction (EF). He was diagnosed as having acromegaly with congestive heart failure from diastolic cardiomyopathy. After the successful transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma, the level of GH was normalized. However, the cardiac dysfunction did not show any improvement even after the administration of \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), or diuretics. The patient was re-hospitalized, and he died of cardiac failure at the age of 25 years. Patients with acromegaly have been reported to have about 30% higher mortality rate, and cardiovascular disease accounts for 60% of the deaths. We report a case of a patient with juvenile acromegaly who was diagnosed with severe cardiac failure at the time of diagnosis and failed to recover cardiac function even after the successful resection of the pituitary adenoma. Immediate diagnosis and treatment are required for better control of acromegalic cardiomyopathy.",

He was referred to our hospital for further examination under suspicion of a cardiac tumor in the left atrium. A chest computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a bronchogenic cyst just under the carina and also compressed left atrium and pulmonary vein from its cranial portion. The cyst was completely excised. After the operation, PAF was stopped and sinus rhythm was preserved. PAF was thought to be due to compression by the bronchogenic cyst.",

    "346": "In a mouse model of permanent coronary ligation, enalapril arrested the release of monocytes from the splenic reservoir and consequently reduced their recruitment into the healing infarct by 45%, as quantified by flow cytometry of digested infarcts. Time-lapse intravital microscopy revealed that enalapril reduces monocyte motility in the spleen. In vitro migration assays and Western blotting showed that this was caused by reduced signaling through the Ang II type 1 receptor. We then studied the long-term consequences of blocked splenic monocyte release in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein (apo)E(-/-) mice, in which infarct healing is impaired because of excessive inflammation in the cardiac wound. Enalapril improved histologic healing biomarkers and reduced inflammation in infarcts measured by FMT-CT (fluorescence molecular tomography in conjunction with x-ray computed tomography) of proteolytic activity. ACE inhibition improved MRI-derived ejection fraction by 14% on day 21, despite initially comparable infarct size. In apoE(-/-) mice, ischemia/reperfusion injury resulted in larger infarct size and enhanced monocyte recruitment and was reversible by enalapril treatment. Splenectomy reproduced antiinflammatory effects of enalapril.",

In the non-statin group, the highest incidence of AMI occurred between 0:00 A.M. and 06.00. There was still a peak incidence between 6.00 A.M. and noon in the statin therapy receiving group; the odds ratio was 1.61 (95% CI 1.34 to 1.80, p=0.001). Accordingly, there was no statistical difference between the statin and non-statin groups regarding circadian variation of AMI.

    "352": "Pea protein isolate was hydrolyzed with alcalase, and the hydrolysate passed through a 1 kDa cutoff ultrafiltration membrane. The permeate was freeze-dried and fractionated on a cationic solid-phase extraction (SPE) column. All fractions were tested for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), renin, and calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase 1 (CaMPDE). With the exception of the first eluted fraction, inhibitory properties of the SPE fractions against CaMPDE (but not ACE and renin) were directly related to cationic character (residence time on the column). However, the fraction that eluted with 1% ammonium hydroxide (SPE 1%) had the highest peptide yield and was subsequently fractionated using two consecutive rounds of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to obtain three peaks with major peptides identified as IR, KF, and EF by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The three dipeptides showed weak inhibitory properties toward CaMPDE but strong inhibitions (IC50 values <25 mM) of ACE and renin. In general, the peptides had higher potency against ACE than against renin. It is indicated from our results that these peptides may be used as potential ingredients to formulate multifunctional food products and nutraceuticals.", 
    "353": "Recent studies have reported a high prevalence of primary aldosteronism among patients with severe hypertension. However, the prevalence of this disease among normotensive and mildly hypertensive patients has not been determined. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of primary aldosteronism among prehypertensive and stage 1 hypertensive subjects. A total of 292 adult subjects with hypertension or prehypertension was screened for primary aldosteronism. Subjects with a plasma aldosterone concentration (ng per 100 ml) to plasma renin activity (ng ml(-1) h(-1)) ratio (ARR) above 20 underwent confirmatory captopril suppression testing. A total of 54 subjects (18.5%) had an ARR above 20. A captopril suppression test was performed in 17 of 54 subjects with probable primary aldosteronism. The test confirmed the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism in 11 (64.7%) of 17 patients, giving a least prevalence of 3.8% for this disease. The 11 patients with primary aldosteronism had a mean \u00b1 s.d. systolic blood pressure of 139 \u00b1 4 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of 95 \u00b1 10 mm Hg and serum potassium of 4.46 \u00b1 0.48 mEq l(-1) at the time of screening test. The prevalence of primary aldosteronism as could be assessed in this study was at least 6.8% in prehypertensive patients, 3.3% in stage 1 hypertensive patients and 3.1% in stage 2 hypertensive patients. In conclusion, this study suggests a high prevalence of primary aldosteronism among prehypertensive and stage 1 hypertensive Japanese patients. Significant numbers of prehypertensive individuals may have subclinical forms of this disease.", 
    "354": "Nicotianamine (NA), which is obtained from vegetables, lowers blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system, and we clarified that NA preferentially inhibits the activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-a zinc-containing enzyme. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism of antihypertensive action of NA through the Magnus method by using rat aortic blood vessels. Angiotensin I-induced contractions were inhibited by NA in a concentration-dependant manner. Because NA did not inhibit angiotensin II-induced contractions, it was believed that NA inhibited ACE activity in vascular smooth muscles. NA did not affect KCl-induced contractions, but it affected norepinephrine-induced contractions to a small extent. NA exerted similar effects on endothelium-denuded and endothelium-intact blood vessels. Therefore, the antihypertensive action of NA did not play a role in the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels, but this effect influenced vasoconstriction by the activation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors. These results suggest that after absorption from the intestinal tract, NA may exert antihypertensive effects via 2 mechanisms: direct inhibition of ACE in vascular smooth muscle and activation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "355": "Cough is the most common symptom reported by patients in a primary care setting and is one of the most frequent secondary effects recorded during treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The aim of the current study was to analyze potential differences in cough induction between 2 structurally different ACE inhibitors, namely zofenopril, which has a sulphydryl moiety, and ramipril, which has a carboxyl moiety. The cough reflex was induced by chemical (citric acid) and/or mechanical stimulation of the tracheobronchial tree in awake and anesthetized rabbits. Intravenous injection of the active compounds of the 2 ACE inhibitors, zofenoprilat (288 nmol/kg) and ramiprilat (129 nmol/kg), caused similar hypotensive effects in anesthetized rabbits. None of the studied cough-related variables changed in response to ACE inhibitor administration, with the exception of the number of coughs. Ramiprilat, but not zofenoprilat, increased the cough response induced by both mechanical and chemical stimulation (1 mol/L citric acid aerosol) of the tracheobronchial tree. In awake animals, zofenoprilat- or vehicle-treated rabbits did not show any significant changes in the number of coughs induced by 1 mol/L citric acid aerosol compared to their respective basal values (from 15.2 \u00b1 2.3 to 13.1 \u00b1 1.3 and from 16.1 \u00b1 4.9 to 15.8 \u00b1 4.3, respectively). Conversely, ramiprilat resulted in a significant increase in the number of coughs (from 21.1 \u00b1 2.6 to 34.9 \u00b1 3.5; P < .01). These findings confirm that there are differences in the cough potentiation effect induced by different ACE inhibitors. The low rate of cough seen with zofenoprilat may be related to its ability to induce a lower accumulation of bradykinin and prostaglandins at the lung level.",

However, patients with nonobstructive CAD may be less likely to receive these therapies compared with patients with obstructive CAD. Therefore, we compared rates of secondary prevention medication prescription between patients with nonobstructive and obstructive CAD.", 
    "357": "We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1 489 745 CAD patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in 786 US centers between 2004 and 2007. We measured rates of aspirin, statin, \u03b2-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) prescription at hospital discharge among eligible patients; 237 167 (15.9%) patients had nonobstructive CAD and 1 252 578 (84.1%) had obstructive CAD. Compared with obstructive CAD patients, nonobstructive CAD patients had significantly lower rates of rates of aspirin (72.7% versus 90.9%), statin (60.0% versus 80.3%), \u03b2-blocker (57.9% versus 79.4%), and ACEI/ARB (45.9% versus 58.6%; all probability values <0.0001) prescription at hospital discharge. After multivariable adjustment, nonobstructive CAD patients remained significantly less likely to receive prescriptions for aspirin (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.39), statins (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.48), \u03b2-blockers (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.47), or ACEI/ARBs (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 0.86) compared with obstructive CAD patients.

The concomitant use of nitrates, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, or insulin has been linked to a potential increase in myocardial ischemic risk with rosiglitazone. The PROactive database provides an opportunity to investigate the effects of these medications on the potential macrovascular benefits reported with pioglitazone.", 
    "360": "The PROactive study was a randomized double-blind prospective trial that evaluated mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in 5238 patients with T2DM and macrovascular disease. Patients received pioglitazone or placebo in addition to their baseline glucose-lowering and cardiovascular medications. The effect of pioglitazone on composite endpoints was evaluated, including all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, as well as safety events of edema and serious heart failure, in subgroups using nitrates, RAS blockers, or insulin at baseline.", 
    "361": "The risk of all-cause death, MI, and stroke for pioglitazone versus placebo was similar regardless of the baseline use of nitrates, RAS blockers, or insulin, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.81 to 0.87. Similar results were obtained for the other composite endpoints analyzed. There were no significant interactions between baseline medication subgroups and treatment. The increased risk of edema and serious heart failure was consistent across the baseline medication subgroups.", 
    "362": "This post hoc analysis did not reveal an increased risk of macrovascular events with pioglitazone in patients receiving nitrates, RAS blockers, or insulin.

    "363": "Hypertension, a significant factor in the development of cerebrovascular disorders, heart disease and renal failure, is a common disorder worldwide. Despite the availability of a wide range of antihypertensive agents, almost two-thirds of hypertensive patients have poorly controlled blood pressure (BP). Numerous clinical trials have shown that most patients require at least two antihypertensive agents to achieve adequate BP control and associated significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Combination therapy using two drugs with different, complementary mechanisms of action achieves better efficacy and tolerability outcomes than treatment with either component drug alone. When such a combination is administered as a fixed-dose formulation, other benefits, such as improved compliance and potentially lower costs, are also likely. The good efficacy and tolerability of the combination of a calcium channel antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is well established, and this combination is recommended by European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology guidelines as a first choice in high-risk hypertensive patients, including those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lercanidipine/enalapril is a promising example of a fixed-dose combination of these drug classes. In clinical trials in hypertensive patients, including those with type 2 diabetes, lercanidipine/enalapril improved BP to a greater extent than either drug as monotherapy (in patients who were previous non-responders to lercanidipine or enalapril) or the combination of lercanidipine/hydrochlorothiazide, and was equally well tolerated. Further studies are required to evaluate the cardiovascular protective effects of lercanidipine/enalapril.", 
    "364": "A capillary column high-performance liquid chromatography (CapLC) method and a laser desorption ionization-time of flight (LDI-TOF)-MS method are described for the determination of quinapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Effective separation was achieved by using a C18 capillary column at a flow rate of 10 microL/min. For CapLC, quinapril and 7-hydroxycoumarin (internal standard) were detected at 210 and 320 nm, respectively. Phenformin replaced 7-hydroxycoumarin as the internal standard for the LDI-TOF-MS method successfully developed to detect quinapril. The calibration curves showed good linearity in the range of 1-100 micro/mL in these two methods. For high throughput purposes, the LDI-TOF-MS method was simpler and faster than the CapLC method. Both green methods were suitably validated and successfully applied to determine quinapril in commercial tablets.", 
    "365": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are of paramount importance in everyday clinical practice. Developed as antihypertensive drugs, they soon acquired another important indication as a result of their antiproteinuric activity and capacity to delay the progression of chronic kidney disease. ACE-i and ARBs started out being used as single drugs and were subsequently combined to obtain more complete blocking of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The most evident advantages derived from the administration of these drugs - alone or in combination - have been obtained in proteinuric nephropathies, such as chronic glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy, where they have become the treatment choice. Dual RAAS blockade has been recently evaluated in a large trial of high-risk cardiovascular patients, in whom no related benefits were shown. To the contrary, a higher risk of worsening renal function emerged. It is now quite clear that patients with high proteinuria levels are the ones that benefit most from RAAS inhibition, also with combined ACE-i and ARB. It is very important to pay the utmost attention when these drugs are used in patients in whom no benefit is obtained by RAAS inhibition, such as patients with chronic kidney disease and atherosclerosis, elderly patients, and those without any significant proteinuria.", 
    "366": "Low-dose antihypertensive drugs in combination are prescribed frequently in clinical practice. Combination treatment is superior to monotherapy with higher doses of each drug in terms of blood pressure reduction and side effects. However, it is unclear whether combination treatment provides additional prognostic benefit beyond the blood pressure lowering effects. We assessed the usefulness of the combined treatment of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASI) and a calcium channel blocker (CCB) for all cardiovascular events in the Japanese Coronary Artery Disease (JCAD) Study population. In the JCAD Study, which is an observational and non-randomized trial, 13,812 patients with angiographically shown narrowing >50% in \u22651 of 3 major coronary arteries were followed up for a mean of 2.7\u00a0years. The primary endpoint of the study was all cardiovascular events. In the present study, baseline covariates possibly influencing the event rate were adjusted between the different treatment groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the event rate between the RASI monotherapy and combined treatment groups, although Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a 23% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003) relative risk reduction with an RASI monotherapy compared with the control group. In conclusion, there may be no additional benefit beyond blood pressure lowering effects in the combination of an RASI and a CCB in patients with angiographically documented CAD.", 
    "367": "Enalapril is effective in the suppression of left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but the effect of telmisartan is unclear. The consecutive 163 AMI patients underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and were randomized to telmisartan (n\u00a0=\u00a082) or enalapril (n\u00a0=\u00a081). Left ventriculography was performed in the acute and chronic (6\u00a0months) phases. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities were measured by zymography in the acute (days 1, 7, and 14) and chronic (6\u00a0months) phases. Plasma pentraxin3 (PTX3), a marker of vascular inflammation, was also measured. There were no adverse effects in the telmisartan group. The analysis of the left ventriculograms in the acute and chronic phases revealed no difference between the two groups. MMP-9 activities at days 7 and 14 and in the chronic phase were decreased compared to that at day 1 in both groups. MMP-2 activity was also decreased in the acute phase, but increased in the chronic phase in both groups. There was no difference in the plasma PTX3 level in the acute phase, but in the chronic phase, PTX3 was significantly lower in telmisartan than in enalapril group (2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 vs. 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0ng/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Telmisartan is well tolerated, shows similar effects on the markers of left ventricular remodeling to those of enalapril, and suppresses vascular inflammation more effectively than enalapril in AMI patients. Telmisartan can be an alternative to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in patients with AMI.", 
    "368": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the catalysis of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and also the breakdown of bradykinin. ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is mediated by inhibited bradykinin degradation leading to enhanced bradykinin plasma levels. The efficacy of currently used standard treatments with antiallergic drugs is questionable. A patient with acute ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema was treated with icatibant, a specific bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema. A single subcutaneous injection of 30\u00a0mg icatibant resulted in a rapid onset of symptom relief and a remarkable shortening of duration of the attack.", 
    "369": "In essential hypertension, the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is an important goal of treatment. In addition to treatment-associated changes in blood pressure (BP), the roles of other determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy regression, including dietary sodium intake, deserve investigation. In the present study, the change in echographic left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed in 182 patients with never-treated essential hypertension at baseline and after 3 years of treatment by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists given at recommended doses and associated with other antihypertensive agents. Treatment was associated with satisfactory control of BP (<140/90 mm Hg) in 64% of patients, and left ventricular hypertrophy prevalence decreased from 56% to 39%. Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium was positively related to LVMI at baseline and at the end of the study, independently of age, sex, and systolic BP. Supine plasma aldosterone concentration was correlated with LVMI only at baseline but not in multivariate analysis. In response to treatment, the percentage of change in LVMI was positively correlated with the absolute changes in systolic BP, urinary sodium, and plasma aldosterone concentration, independently of baseline LVMI. The population was divided into 3 tertiles according to final values of gender-specific urinary sodium. When, within each urinary sodium tertile, patients were divided into those with plasma aldosterone concentration below and above the median (11.6 ng/dL), LVMI progressively increased across sodium tertiles only in patients with high plasma aldosterone concentration. Systolic BP was similar across all of the groups. In conclusion, aldosterone requires the presence of high dietary salt for the expression of its unfavorable effect on the heart.", 
    "370": "Hypertension is an important independent risk factor for renal disease. If hypertension and chronic renal disease co-exist, as is common in patients with diabetes mellitus, the risk of cardiovascular disease is heightened. The importance of rigorous blood pressure control is recognized in current guidelines, with a recommended target of office blood pressure of < 130/80 mmHg; although ambulatory blood pressure may be more appropriate in order to identify the 24-hour hypertensive burden. Even lower blood pressure may further reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease, but the incidence of cardiovascular events may increase. Albuminuria not only indicates renal damage, but is also a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality at least in patients with high cardiovascular risk and potentially pre-existing vascular damage. Management of the multiple factors for renal and cardiovascular disease is mandatory in the diabetic patient. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the progression of renal disease, as well as in hypertension and target-organ damage. The use of agents that target the RAS confer renoprotection in addition to antihypertensive activity. There is extensive evidence of the renoprotective effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and specifically telmisartan. In addition to providing 24-hour blood pressure control, clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that telmisartan improves renal endothelial function, prevents progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria, slows the decline in glomerular filtration rate and reduces proteinuria in overt nephropathy. These effects cannot be solely attributed to blood pressure control. In contrast to other members of the ARB class, the renoprotective effect of telmisartan is not confined to the management of diabetic nephropathy; slowing the progression of albuminuria has been demonstrated in the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET), which included diabetic and non-diabetic patients at high risk of cardiovascular events.",

Analysis of main physiological mechanisms underlying regulation of hemodynamics is presented at different steps of formation of the cardiovascular system and angiogenesis from fetal life to the outset of involutional processes. Effect of environmental factors on these processes and compensatory reactions are considered. Algorithm of differential diagnosis of arterial hypertension and hypertensive disease is proposed along with the approaches to the choice of adequate therapeutic modalities, their role in the treatment and prevention of complications.

    "372": "The main clinical manifestations of advanced chronic heart failure (CHF), e.g. in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), are reduced systolic and diastolic functions, increased arterial elastance and arterio-ventricular uncoupling, accompanied and exacerbated by an excessive sympathetic activation and extensive abnormalities in the \u03b2AR signaling. Loss of cardiomyocytes due to apoptosis is one mechanism that undoubtedly contributes to cardiac remodeling and functional deterioration associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Research during the last decade on the single cardiomyocyte level strongly suggested that selective stimulation of \u03b2(1) AR activates the proapoptotic signaling pathways, while selective stimulation of \u03b2(2) AR is antiapoptotic, but its precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Extensive research in the rat model of DCM following induction of myocardial infarction (MI) showed that prolonged treatment with of \u03b2(2) AR agonist, fenoterol, in combination with a \u03b2(1) AR blocker, metoprolol, is more effective than \u03b2(1) AR blocker alone and as effective as \u03b2(1) AR blocker with ACE inhibitor with respect to survival and cardiac remodeling. This combined regimen of \u03b2(2) AR agonists and a \u03b2(1) AR blocker might be considered for clinical testing as alternative or adjunct therapy to currently acceptable CHF arsenal.

The length and width of cardiomyocytes were analysed 24 h after administration of factors. Renin caused an unexpected effect on the length of cardiomyocytes that was inhibited by mannose-6-phosphate and monensin, but not by administration of glucose-6-phosphate. Endothelin-1 used as a classical pro-hypertrophic agonist increased cell width but not cell length. Renin caused an activation of p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. The latter activation was impaired by mannose-6-phosphate. Inhibition of p42/44 but not of p38 MAP kinase activation attenuated the effect of renin on cell length. In contrast, activation of PPAR-\u03b3 reduced cell length. Feeding wild-type mice with pioglitazone, a PPAR-\u03b3 agonist, reduced cell length. Cardiomyocytes isolated from PPAR-\u03b3 knockout mice were longer, and their length was not affected by pioglitazone. Cardiomyocytes isolated from TGR(mRen2)27 rats were longer than those of non-transgenic littermates. Cell length was reduced by feeding these mice with pioglitazone.

The efficacy and safety of once-daily extended-release carvedilol (carvedilol CR) combined with the ACEI lisinopril in a double-blind, randomized, factorial design study were studied. Patients (N=656) with stage 1 or 2 hypertension were randomized evenly to 1 of 15 groups for 6 weeks: carvedilol CR monotherapy 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg/d; lisinopril monotherapy 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg/d; or 1 of 9 combinations of carvedilol CR plus lisinopril initiated simultaneously. Primary efficacy measures (assessed by ambulatory BP monitoring [ABPM]) were change from baseline in 24-hour mean diastolic BP (DBP) and in trough (20-24 hours) DBP. Continuous efficacy variables were assessed using analysis of covariance. Whether any combination dose was superior to its monotherapy components was assessed using the Hung AVE procedure. Despite the presence of additional BP lowering observed with most of the combinations compared with their monotherapy components, the Hung AVE test was not significant for either primary efficacy measures. Post hoc analyses of the high-dose combination groups (carvedilol CR/lisinopril regimens of 80/10 mg, 80/20 mg, 80/40 mg, 20/40 mg, and 40/40 mg) showed a significant treatment difference compared with both carvedilol CR 80 mg and lisinopril 40 mg for 24-hour mean DBP but not for trough DBP. With the exception of dizziness, individual adverse events did not increase with ascending doses or combinations. The superiority of initiating combination treatment with carvedilol CR and lisinopril compared with the monotherapy components was not demonstrated with the ABPM measurements. Nonetheless, the post hoc assessment combining all high-dose groups did produce significant 24-hour mean BP reduction when compared with the high-dose monotherapy groups.

Chymase is a potent local angiotensin II-forming enzyme in several species, including humans and hamsters. However, the pathophysiological role of chymase is not fully understood. Here, we report a causal role of chymase in diabetic nephropathy and the therapeutic effectiveness of chymase inhibition. In the present study, renal chymase expression was markedly upregulated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic hamsters. Oral administration of a specific chymase inhibitor, TEI-F00806, completely ameliorated proteinuria, the overexpression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and fibronectin in glomeruli, and renal mesangial expansion, by normalizing the increase in intrarenal angiotensin II levels in diabetic hamsters independently of blood pressure levels. In contrast, ramipril did not show such sufficient effects. These effects occurred in parallel with improvements in superoxide production and expression of NAD(P)H oxidase components [NAD(P)H oxidase 4 and p22(phox)] in glomeruli. This study showed for the first time that chymase inhibition may protect against elevated intrarenal angiotensin II levels, oxidative stress, and renal dysfunction in diabetes.

Hypertension plays a critical role in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but it has also been postulated that antihypertensive drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) show class-specific renoprotective actions beyond their blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects. 2. Because this notion has recently been questioned, in the present study we compared the effects of a RAS-dependent antihypertensive therapy (a combination of trandolapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and losartan, an angiotensin-II (AngII) receptor subtype 1A receptor antagonist) with a 'RAS-independent' antihypertensive therapy (a combination of labetalol, an alfa- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist with the diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide) on the progression of CKD after 5/6 renal ablation (5/6 NX) in Ren-2 renin transgenic rats (TGR), a model of AngII-dependent hypertension. Normotensive transgene-negative Hannover Sprague-Dawley (HanSD) rats after 5/6 NX served as controls. 3. RAS-dependent and -independent antihypertensive therapies normalized BP and survival rate, and prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis to the same degree in 5/6 NX HanSD rats and in 5/6 NX TGR. The present findings show that renoprotection, at least in rats after 5/6 NX, is predominantly BP-dependent. When equal lowering of BP was achieved, leading to normotension, cardio- and renoprotective effects were equivalent irrespective of the type of antihypertensive therapy. 4.

The progression of the disease is an active process leading to forming of bone matrix and heavily calcified stiff cusps by inflammatory cells and osteopontin. Aortic stenosis is a chronic, progressive disease which can remain asymptomatic for a long time even in the presence of severe aortic stenosis. MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR AORTIC STENOSIS: The need for alternative to aortic valve surgery is highlighted by increasing longevity of the population and new therapeutic strategies to limit disease progression are needed to delay or potentially avoid, the need for valve surgery. Currently, there are no established disease modifying treatments in regard to the progression of aortic stenosis. The first results about influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins on aortic sclerosis and stenosis progression are promising. Statins are likely to reduce cardiovascular events rather than disease progression, but may be potentially a valuable preventive treatment in these patients.

Liposomal anthracycline formulations with reduced drug exposure and lower plasma concentrations may still be cardiotoxic at higher cumulative doses [10]. Beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity,but have not been tested in long-term prospective, randomized,controlled studies with well defined cardiotoxicity criteria and careful cardiac function monitoring [11\u201316]. We investigated doxorubicin-induced clinical or subclinical cardiotoxicity in lymphoma patients after concomitant prophylactic therapy with metoprolol or enalapril or no concomitant treatment. We examined whether cardiotoxicity was related to the treatment or any other variable. We found that HF was less frequent under concomitant treatment than no treatment, especially in the metoprolol group, but the differences were not significant. No association was found between the presence of cardiotoxicity and concomitant treatment or other variable apart of age that had a significant impact. The marginal benefit seen with metoprolol should be investigated further.",

Serum lactate dehydrogenase activity and cholesterol level which were significantly increased in ISP-intoxicated group compared with control were reduced in groups administered ISP and treated with SM. Serum phosphate levels in groups administered ISP and treated with SM were significantly lower than values obtained for the ISP-intoxicated group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Tissue catalase and superoxide dismutase activities as well as glutathione level were significantly increased in groups administered ISP and treated with SM compared to ISP-intoxicated group while MDA and nitrite levels were decreased. Disruption in the structure of cardiac myofibrils by ISP intoxication was reduced by treatment with SM. Comparable results were obtained for ramipril.

When the reduction in systolic BP in the two groups was compared, there was no significant difference between the groups (P > 0.05). However, the mean reduction in diastolic BP achieved with telmisartan at 12 weeks was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that achieved with enalapril after the corresponding period.

Therapies initially aimed at reversing hemodynamic abnormalities in HF, increasing cardiac output, decreasing intracardiac pressures, and blocking vasoconstriction. However, none of these therapies improved survival and some actually increased mortality. Now therapies for HF related to left ventricular systolic dysfunction have focused on counteracting compensatory neurohormonal activation. Several neurohormonal activations are present in HF supporting hemodynamics, but they appear to be deleterious in the long term on the myocardium, increasing progression of the HF and mortality. Blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic system are now the mainstay of medical therapy in HF related to systolic dysfunction as they decrease mortality, hospitalisation rate and improve quality of life. Hence, the approach to patient with chronic heart failure should differ from that of patient with acute heart failure.",

Here we present a 75-year-old man who developed acute renal failure after olmesartan treatment. Following discontinuation of olmesartan, his renal functions normalized. His renal Doppler ultrasonography and renal angiography showed findings consistent with bilateral RAS. In this case, unlike those previously reported, renal failure developed with olmesartan for the first time and after only a single dose, which is thought to be a new, safe, and tolerable antihypertensive agent. This is a well-defined effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in patients with RAS. Also with the increasing use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), renal failure associated with ARBs in patients with RAS is rising. The use of olmesartan also requires caution and close follow-up of renal functions for patients who have risk factors.",

After isolating jejunal tissue from wild-type and Pept1 null mice, 2 cm intestinal segments were everted and mounted on glass rods for tissue uptake studies. [(14)C]GlySar (4 \u03bcM) was studied as a function of time, temperature, sodium and pH, concentration, and potential inhibitors. Compared with wild-type animals, Pept1 null mice exhibited a 78% reduction in GlySar uptake at pH 6.0 at 37\u00b0C. GlySar uptake showed pH dependence, with peak values between pH 6.0 and 6.5 in wild-type animals, whereas no such tendency was observed in Pept1 null mice. GlySar exhibited Michaelis-Menten uptake kinetics and a minor nonsaturable component in wild-type animals. In contrast, GlySar uptake occurred only by a nonsaturable process in Pept1 null mice. GlySar uptake was significantly inhibited by dipeptides, aminocephalosporins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the antiviral prodrug valacyclovir; these inhibitors had little, if any, effect on the uptake of GlySar in Pept1 null mice. The findings demonstrate that PEPT1 plays a critical role in the uptake of GlySar in jejunum and suggest that PEPT1 is the major transporter responsible for the intestinal absorption of small peptides.",

To do so, protein synthesis, cardiac fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and secretion in response to treatment with Ang III and Ang II were investigated. Protein synthesis rate was assessed by (3)H-Leucine ((3)H-Leu) incorporation; the content of DNA was defined by (3)H-thymidine ((3)H-TdR) incorporation; and collagen synthesis and secretion were assessed by ( 3)H-proline ((3)H-Pro) incorporation. In neonatal cardiomyocytes, Ang III stimulated protein synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas in neonatal cardiac fibroblasts, DNA synthesis as well as collagen synthesis and secretion were increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with captopril, selective aminopeptidase A (APA) inhibitor (EC33), or selective aminopeptidase N inhibitor (PC18) had no effect on these outcomes. Treatment with losartan significantly decreased the effects of Ang III, except for cardiomyocyte protein synthesis. Compared with Ang II, Ang III could stimulate cardiomyocyte protein synthesis, cardiac fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis and secretion. Furthermore, 10(-7) mol/L Ang II but not Ang III significantly increased APA activity in both cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. All these results show the bioactive effects of Ang III on myocardial cells and suggest that Ang III could be an important independent factor besides Ang II in the regulation of cardiac function and may affect the pathogenesis of cardiac remodeling.", 
    "455": "The role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in postnatal vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during skeletal muscle (SKM) regeneration is unknown. We examined the capacity of ANG II to stimulate capillary formation and growth during cardiotoxin-induced muscle regeneration in ACE inhibitor-treated ANG II type 1a receptor knockout (AT1a(-/-)) and C57Bl/6 control mice. Analysis of tibialis anterior (TA) cross-sections revealed 17% and 23% reductions in capillarization in AT1a(-/-) and captopril treated mice, respectively, when compared with controls, 21 days postinjury. Conversely, no differences in capillarization were detected at early time points (7 and 10 days). These results identify ANG II as a regulator of angiogenesis but not vasculogenesis in vivo. In vitro angiogenesis assays of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) further confirmed ANG II as proangiogeneic as 71% and 124% increases in tube length and branch point number were observed following ANG II treatment. Importantly, treatment of HUVECs with conditioned media from differentiated muscle cells resulted in an 84% and 203% increase in tube length and branch point number compared with controls, which was abolished following pretreatment of the cells with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The pro-angiogenic effect of ANG II can be attributed to an enhanced endothelial cell migration because both transwell and under agarose migration assays revealed a 37% and 101% increase in cell motility, respectively. Collectively, these data highlight ANG II as a proangiogenic regulator during SKM regeneration in vivo and more importantly demonstrates that ANG II released from SKM can signal endothelial cells and regulate angiogenesis through the induction of endothelial cell migration.",

The concentration of serum potassium was high, and normal sinus rhythm was restored after correction of the serum potassium level. The cause of hyperkalemia was considered to be several doses of spiranolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, in addition to the long-term intake of ramipril, an ACE inhibitor. This case is a good example of electrolyte imbalance causing acute life-threatening cardiac events. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of hyperkalemia, especially in elderly patients using ACE/ARB in combination with potassium sparing agents and who have mild renal disturbance.", 
    "457": "Combination therapy is necessary for most patients with hypertension, and agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are mainstays in hypertension management, especially for patients at high cardiovascular and renal risk. Single blockade of the RAAS with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) confers some cardiorenal protection; however, these agents do not extinguish the RAAS as evidenced by a reactive increase in plasma renin activity (PRA), a cardiovascular risk marker, and incomplete cardiorenal protection. Dual blockade with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB offers no additional benefit in patients with hypertension and normal renal and left ventricular function. Indeed, PRA increases synergistically with dual blockade. Aliskiren, the first direct renin inhibitor (DRI) to become available has provided an opportunity to study the merit of DRI/ARB combination treatment. By blocking the first and rate-limiting step in the RAAS, aliskiren reduces PRA by at least 70% and buffers the compensatory increase in PRA observed with ACE inhibitors and ARBs. The combination of a DRI and an ARB or an ACE inhibitor is an effective approach for lowering blood pressure; available data indicate that such combinations favorably affect proteinuria, left ventricular mass index, and brain natriuretic peptide in patients with albuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure, respectively. Ongoing outcome studies will clarify the role of aliskiren and aliskiren-based combination RAAS blockade in patients with hypertension and those at high cardiorenal risk.",

Thus, for each molecule a data matrix of QTMS descriptors (having information from both topology and electronic features) were calculated. Using four different criterion based on principal component analysis of the QTMS data matrices, four different sets of AA indices were generated.

The structural and IR spectroscopic characterization of protonated S-nitrosocaptopril (SNOcapH(+)) is aided by the comparative study of the parent species lacking the NO feature, namely protonated captopril. The study is accomplished by methodologies based on tandem mass spectrometry, namely by energy resolved collision-induced dissociation and infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy, backed by density functional theory calculations. IRMPD spectra have been obtained both in the 1000-1900 cm(-1) fingerprint range, using a beamline of the infrared free electron laser (IR-FEL) at the Centre Laser Infrarouge d'Orsay (CLIO), and in the O-H and N-H stretching region (2900-3700 cm(-1)) using the tunable IR radiation of a tabletop parametric oscillator/amplifier (OPO/OPA) laser source. The structural features of the ion have been ascertained by comparison of the experimental IRMPD spectra with the IR transitions calculated for the lowest energy isomers. Evidence is obtained that protonation occurs at the amide carbonyl oxygen which is found to be the thermodynamically most basic site. However, SNOcapH(+) is present as a thermally equilibrated mixture of low-energy structures, with a major contribution of the most stable isomer characterized by a trans relationship of the positively charged OH group with respect to the carboxylic acid functionality on the adjacent proline ring and by an anti conformation at the S-N (partial) double bond, though the energy difference with the analogous trans-syn isomer is less than 1 kJ mol(-1).

This paper reviews (1) the mechanisms of sarcopenia, (2) the diagnosis of sarcopenia, and (3) the potential interventions for sarcopenia. Multiple factors appear to be involved in the development of sarcopenia including the loss of muscle mass and muscle fibers, increased inflammation, altered hormonal levels, poor nutritional status, and altered renin-angiotensin system. The lack of diagnostic criteria to identify patients with sarcopenia hinders potential management options. To date, pharmacological interventions have shown limited efficacy in counteracting the effects of sarcopenia. Recent evidence has shown benefits with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; however, further randomized controlled trials are required. Resistance training remains the most effective intervention for sarcopenia; however, older people maybe unable or unwilling to embark on strenuous exercise training programs.",

Two of the congenic strains carry a 3.5-Mbp portion and a 2.6-Mbp portion of chromosome 13 that lie on opposite sides of the renin locus, while the third contains a 2.0-Mbp overlapping region that includes the BN renin allele. While maintained on a normal salt (0.4% NaCl) diet, MCAs from Dahl SS rats and the congenic strains retaining the Dahl SS renin allele failed to dilate in response to ACh, whereas MCAs from the congenic strain carrying the BN renin allele exhibited normal vascular relaxation. In congenic rats receiving the BN renin allele, vasodilator responses to ACh were eliminated by nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with captopril, and AT(1) receptor blockade with losartan. N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester-sensitive vasodilation in response to ACh was restored in MCAs of Dahl SS rats that received either a 3-day infusion of a subpressor dose of angiotensin II (3 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) iv), or chronic treatment with the superoxide dismutase mimetic tempol (15 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)). These findings indicate that the presence of the Dahl SS renin allele plays a crucial role in endothelial dysfunction present in the cerebral circulation of the Dahl SS rat, even in the absence of elevated dietary salt intake, and that introgression of the BN renin allele rescues endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses by restoring normal activation of the renin-angiotensin system.",

Immobilization increased the plasma levels of angiotensin II and ACE activity that were inhibited by treatment with ramipril, but not losartan. Furthermore, immobilization increased the plasma level of malondialdehyde and expression of gp91(phox) and Rho-associated kinase-1 in arteries, and decreased the arterial eNOS mRNA and oxidized products of NO (nitrite plus nitrate).

The purpose of this study was to determine whether inhibition of NEP and ACE or deletion of NEP provides protection from nerve impairment caused by diabetes or diet induced obesity (DIO). To determine the role of NEP and ACE inhibition in neuropathy related to insulin-deficient diabetes or DIO we used C57Bl/6J mice treated with AVE7688, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, or NEP deficient (-/-) mice. Mice at 12 weeks of age were fed a high fat diet for 12 weeks or were diabetic for duration of 12 weeks following a single injection of high dose streptozotocin. Both a prevention and intervention protocol was used for AVE7688 treatment. Glucose utilization was impaired in DIO C57Bl/6J and NEP -/- mice. However, treating DIO C57Bl/6J or NEP -/- mice with AVE7688 improved glucose tolerance. Thermal hypoalgesia and nerve conduction slowing were present in both streptozotocin-diabetic and DIO C57Bl/6J mice but not in AVE7688 treated C57Bl/6J mice or NEP -/- mice exposed to either streptozotocin-induced diabetes or a high fat diet. Intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) profiles were decreased in the hindpaw of C57Bl/6J diabetic or DIO mice and this improved when the mice were treated with AVE7688. IENF profiles were not decreased in diabetic or DIO NEP (-/-) mice. These studies suggest that NEP plays a role in regulating nerve function in insulin-deficient diabetes and DIO.",

The present study investigated the effect of zofenopril and ramipril on cough induced by citric acid in guinea pig and the involvement of bradykinin (BK) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in mediating the responses of these drugs. Zofenopril (10\u00a0mg/kg) or ramipril (3-10\u00a0mg/kg), which is threefold more potent than zofenopril, on a mg basis, in lowering blood pressure, was orally administered daily in drinking water for 2\u00a0weeks. At the end of this period, aerosol of citric acid solution (0.1\u00a0M) was performed and the number of cough counted for 10\u00a0min. The role of the kinin B(2) receptor was also investigated. BK and PGE2 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were measured after repeated oral treatment with zofenopril or ramipril (10\u00a0mg/kg). Ramipril (3-10\u00a0mg/kg) increased citric acid-induced cough by 40% and 60%, respectively, as compared to the vehicle control group (15.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8), while zofenopril (10\u00a0mg/kg) was without effect. The enhancement of citric acid-induced cough caused by ramipril (10\u00a0mg/kg) was reduced by the kinin B(2) receptor antagonist MEN16132 (0.25\u00a0mg/kg ip). BK and PGE2 levels in the BAL fluid were increased, in comparison to the control group, after ramipril treatment, while they were unchanged after zofenopril administration.

To date, animal studies with inhaled bradykinin have been performed only in anesthetized guinea pigs and rats, where it causes bronchoconstriction through sensory nerve pathways. In the present study, airway function was recorded in conscious guinea pigs by whole-body plethysmography. Inhaled bradykinin (1 mM, 20 s) caused bronchoconstriction and influx of inflammatory cells to the lungs, but only when the enzymatic breakdown of bradykinin by angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase was inhibited by captopril (1 mg/kg i.p.) and phosphoramidon (10 mM, 20-min inhalation), respectively. The bronchoconstriction and cell influx were antagonized by the B(2) kinin receptor antagonist 4-(S)-amino-5-(4-{4-[2,4-dichloro-3-(2,4-dimethyl-8-quinolyloxymethyl)phenylsulfonamido]-tetrahydro-2H-4-pyranylcarbonyl}piperazino)-5-oxopentyl](trimethyl)ammonium chloride hydrochloride (MEN16132) when given by inhalation (1 and 10 \u03bcM, 20 min) and are therefore mediated via B(2) kinin receptors. However, neither intraperitioneal MEN16132 nor the peptide B(2) antagonist icatibant, by inhalation, antagonized these bradykinin responses. Sensitization of guinea pigs with ovalbumin was not sufficient to induce airway hyperreactivity (AHR) to the bronchoconstriction by inhaled bradykinin. However, ovalbumin challenge of sensitized guinea pigs caused AHR to bradykinin and histamine. Infection of guinea pigs by nasal instillation of parainfluenza-3 virus produced AHR to inhaled histamine and lung influx of inflammatory cells. These responses were attenuated by the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist MEN16132 and H-(4-chloro)DPhe-2'(1-naphthylalanine)-(3-aminopropyl)guanidine (VA999024), an inhibitor of tissue kallikrein, the enzyme responsible for lung synthesis of bradykinin.

The underlying cause in the majority of CVD patients is atherosclerosis and its complications, respectively. The present paper focuses on prevention and timely treatment of atherosclerosis. Management should be comprehensive and should target the risk factors (RF). Hypertension, hyperlipoproteinaemia and dyslipidemia (HLP and DLP), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), visceral fat obesity and cigarette smoking are the dominating RFs. Even though all RFs have to be managed simultaneously and it is not possible to focus on just one of them, for the sake of clarity, this paper discusses hypertension and the use of telmisartan, a representative of one the most up-to-date group of antihypertensives. There is a growing evidence that it is not always just a reduction of a specific risk that is important but also the mode of treatment. For example, to reduce a CV risk in a patient with hypertension but also, for example, with metabolic syndrome, it is more beneficial to treat the patient with rennin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocking agents, possibly in a combination with calcium channels antagonists, than to use \"traditional\" (older) treatment approach with a combination of a beta/blocker and diuretic. Among the RAS-modifying agents, ACE inhibitors and sartans are the most widely used.

In comparison with the Ad-GFP group, the Ad-ACE2 group exhibited reduced systolic blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, glomeruli sclerosis index and renal malondialdehyde level; downregulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and collagen IV protein expression; and increased renal superoxide dismutase activity. Ad-ACE2 and ACEI had similar effects, whereas combined use of Ad-ACE2 and ACEI offered no additional benefits. ACE2 transfection attenuated angiotensin (Ang) II-induced glomerular mesangial cell proliferation, oxidative stress and collagen IV protein synthesis. In conclusion, ACE2 exerts a renoprotective effect similar to that of ACEI treatment. Decreased renal Ang II, increased renal Ang-(1-7) levels, and inhibited oxidative stress were the possible mechanisms involved.", 
    "515": "Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) refers to a clinical and pathologic syndrome in which endothelial injury results in the manifestations of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and kidney injury. A host of causes may induce endothelial injury and TMA, including enteric bacterial toxins, deficiency or dysfunction of complement regulatory proteins, deficiency or inhibition of von Willebrand factor-cleaving proteases, and factors that inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and turnover. This has led specialists to concentrate on these specific inciting factors in terms of designing treatment and management. However, a key and less recognized factor is the underlying level of endothelial health. Many persons with hereditary causes may remain disease free for years or may never develop disease. Others with acute inciting events, such as Escherichia coli O157 enteritis, never manifest TMA. Experimental studies document the importance of specific factors, such as endothelial nitric oxide levels, in helping protect animals from TMA. This suggests that one might approach the management of TMA not simply with specific treatments aimed at the underlying hereditary cause or inciting event, but rather at general measures that may improve overall endothelial health. We propose studies to determine whether interventions that improve endothelial health, such as the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, vitamin C, allopurinol, or nitric oxide-producing drugs, may be able to prevent TMA, even in persons with underlying hereditary conditions that otherwise would predispose them to these diseases.",

Strategies that block this activation have consistently demonstrated major beneficial impacts on morbidity and mortality in this setting. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) present a novel opportunity to block at an additional or alternative step in this pathway, that being conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Theoretical benefits of blocking at the level of renin include: inhibition of the reflex activation of plasma renin activity induced by conventional downstream RAAS blockers. Minimization of angiotensin II and/or aldosterone escape and blocking upstream at the rate-limiting step of angiotensin I production. Preclinical and early-phase clinical studies have largely supported this hypothesis. In the Aliskiren Observation of Heart Failure Treatment study, patients with systolic chronic heart failure receiving background angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and \u03b2-blockers benefited from aliskiren in reduction vs placebo of plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide, the primary efficacy endpoint of that study. Large-scale outcome trials are, however, required to definitively determine the benefits of a DRI strategy additional to, or as an alternative to, conventional approaches such as ACE inhibitors in the systolic chronic heart failure setting.

    "522": "Microvascular coronary dysfunction (MCD) is an increasingly recognized cause of cardiac ischemia and angina that is diagnosed more commonly in women. Patients with MCD present with the triad of persistent chest pain, ischemic changes on stress testing, and no obstructive coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. Data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study show that the diagnosis of MCD is not benign, with a 2.5% annual risk of adverse cardiac events including myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and death. The gold standard diagnostic test for MCD is the invasive coronary reactivity test (CRT), which uses acetylcholine, adenosine, and nitroglycerin to test endothelial-dependent and -independent microvascular and macrovascular coronary function. The CRT allows for diagnostic and treatment options as well as further risk stratification of patients for future cardiovascular events. Treatment of angina and MCD should be aimed at ischemia disease management to reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events, ameliorate symptoms to improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity from unnecessary and repeated cardiac catheterization in patients with open coronary arteries. A comprehensive treatment approach aimed at risk factor management, including lifestyle counseling regarding smoking cessation, nutrition, and physical activity, should be initiated. Current pharmacotherapy for MCD may include treatment of microvascular endothelial dysfunction (with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or low-dose aspirin), as well as treatment for angina and myocardial ischemia (with \u03b2-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or ranolazine). Additional symptom management techniques may include tricyclic medication, enhanced external counterpulsation, hypnosis, and spinal cord stimulation. Although our current therapies are effective in treating angina and MCD, large randomized outcome trials are needed to optimize strategies to improve morbidity and mortality.", 
    "523": "Anthracyclines are common chemotherapeutic agents used to treat many different types of cancer. Unfortunately, the use of anthracyclines is limited by their cardiotoxic effects, which may become manifest as late as 20\u00a0years from initial exposure. Studies in cells and animals suggest that the mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) is multifactorial. Anthracyclines induce multiple forms of cellular injury by free radical production. In addition, anthracyclines alter nucleic acid biology by intercalation into DNA and modulate intracellular signaling, leading to cell death and the disruption of homeostatic processes such as sarcomere maintenance. In an effort to decrease AIC, many strategies have been tested, but no specific therapies are universally acknowledged to prevent or treat anthracycline-induced cardiac dysfunction. Newer imaging modalities and cardiac biomarkers may be useful in improving early detection of cardiac injury and dysfunction. As long as there is no cardiac-specific therapy for AIC, evidence suggests that high-risk patients will benefit from prophylactic treatment with neurohormonal blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers.",

Our goal was to evaluate in those with diabetes the likelihood of developing a DFU or LEA among users of ACEi or ARB using a retrospective cohort design of general practices in the United Kingdom. We studied 40,342 individuals at least 35 years of age with diabetes who were first prescribed ACEi or ARB between 1995 and 2006. A total of 35,153 individuals were treated with ACEi, 12,437 individuals with ARB, and 7,310 both. The hazard ratio for DFU was 0.50 (95% confidence intervals: 0.43, 0.59), showing an increased risk of DFU for those using ACEi vs. ARB. The hazard ratio for LEA was 0.72 (0.48, 1.01). However, among those with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease the hazard ratio was 0.45 (0.22, 0.91) for the new onset of a LEA. In conclusion, among those with diabetes, exposure to ACEi as compared with ARB increases the risk of developing a DFU or LEA.",

The renin-angiotensin system is a key regulator of blood pressure. In this study, we examined possible interactions between 20-HETE and the renin-angiotensin system. In normotensive (110\u00b13 mm Hg) Sprague-Dawley rats transduced with a lentivirus expressing the CYP4A2 cDNA under the control of an endothelial-specific promoter (VECAD-4A2), systolic blood pressure increased rapidly, reaching 139\u00b11, 145\u00b13, and 150\u00b12 mm Hg at 3, 5, and 10 days after transduction; blood pressure remained elevated, thereafter, with maximum levels of 163\u00b13 mm Hg. Treatment with lisinopril, losartan, or the 20-HETE antagonist 20-hydroxyeicosa-6(Z), 15(Z)-dienoic acid decreased blood pressure to control values, but blood pressure returned to its high levels after cessation of treatment. Endothelial-specific overexpression of CYP4A2 resulted in increased expression of vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor and increased levels of plasma and tissue angiotensin II; all were attenuated by treatment with HET0016, an inhibitor of 20-HETE synthesis, or with 20-hydroxyeicosa-6(Z), 15(Z)-dienoic acid. In cultured endothelial cells, 20-HETE specifically and potently induced ACE expression without altering the expression of ACE2, angiotensinogen, or angiotensin II receptors. This is the first study to demonstrate that 20-HETE, a key constrictor eicosanoid in the microcirculation, induces ACE and angiotensin II type 1 receptor expression and increases angiotensin II levels, suggesting that the mechanisms by which 20-HETE promotes hypertension include activation of the renin-angiotensin system that is likely initiated at the level of ACE induction.",

In this study, a multicenter, open, randomized trial was designed to compare the antiproteinuric effect between cilnidipine and amlodipine when coupled with RAS inhibitors in hypertensive patients with significant proteinuria. Proteinuria was evaluated by 24-h home urine collection for all patients. A total of 35 proteinuric (>0.1 g/day) patients with uncontrolled BP (>135/85 mmHg) were randomized to receive either cilnidipine (n = 18) or amlodipine (n = 17) after a 6-month treatment with RAS inhibitors and were followed for 48 weeks.

Female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were fed normal rat chow and from conception to weaning drank 3% beta-alanine in water (taurine depletion, TD) or water alone (Control, C). Female offspring ate a normal rat chow and drank water with (G) or without (W) 5% glucose throughout the experiment.

At 7-8 weeks of age, arterial pressure, heart rate, baroreflex control of heart rate and renal nerve activity were studied in either conscious, freely moving or anesthetized rats. Perinatal taurine depletion did not alter resting mean arterial pressure or heart rate in the adult female offspring that received either high or normal sugar intake. Captopril treatment slightly decreased mean arterial pressure but not heart rate in all groups. Compared to controls, only the TDG rats displayed blunted baroreflex responses.

Proportions of full adherence (PDC >80%) did not change over time for ABs (54% in both 1996 and 2003) but increased slightly for BBs (from 47% in 1996 to 57% in 2003) and SL (from 31% in 1996 to 42% in 2003). Black race and dialysis treatment predicted poor adherence to any medications. Adherence to BBs and SL increased modestly over time, but overall nonadherence remained high.",

ACE contains two domains, the N and C domains, both of which are heavily glycosylated. Structural studies of ACE have been fraught with severe difficulties because of surface glycosylation of the protein. In order to investigate the role of glycosylation in the N domain and to create suitable forms for crystallization, we have investigated the importance of the 10 potential N-linked glycan sites using enzymatic deglycosylation, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry. A number of glycosylation mutants were generated via site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in CHO cells, and analyzed for enzymatic activity and thermal stability. At least eight of 10 of the potential glycan sites are glycosylated; three C-terminal sites were sufficient for expression of active N domain, whereas two N-terminal sites are important for its thermal stability. The minimally glycosylated Ndom389 construct was highly suitable for crystallization studies. The structure in the presence of an N domain-selective phosphinic inhibitor RXP407 was determined to 2.0 \u212b resolution. The Ndom389 structure revealed a hinge region that may contribute to the breathing motion proposed for substrate binding.",

Remaining STAT patients, after excluding those with a primary neurologic diagnosis, constitute the non-HF cohort. An adverse composite outcome was defined as mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, hospital length of stay more than 1 week, or death within 30 days. Of 1199 patients, 302 (25.2%) had AHF. Acute HF patients and non-AHF patients were similar in age, sex, and overall mortality, but AHF patients were more commonly African American, with a history of HF, diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prior hypertension admissions. Heart failure patients had higher creatinine and natriuretic peptide levels but lower ejection fraction. They were more likely admitted to the ICU; receive electrocardiograms, bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation, and CXRs; and be readmitted within 90 days.

    "576": "The mechanism underlying the dermatological manifestations that accompany captopril therapy is not known. The facts that prolidase plays an important role in collagen biosynthesis and that captopril directly inhibits prolidase activity led us to evaluate its effect on collagen biosynthesis in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Confluent fibroblasts were treated with milimolar concentrations (0.2-1 mM) of captopril (CAP) for 48 h. It was found that CAP-dependent decrease in prolidase activity was accompanied by parallel decrease in collagen biosynthesis. Since insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) is the most potent regulator of both collagen biosynthesis and prolidase activity, and prolidase is regulated by beta1 integrin signaling, the effect of CAP on IGF-IR and beta1 integrin receptor expressions was evaluated. It was found that exposure of the cells to 0.3 mM CAP contributed to a decrease in IGF-IR, alpha2beta1 integrin receptor and MAPK/ERK1/2 expressions. The data suggest that CAP-dependent decrease of collagen biosynthesis in cultured human skin fibroblasts results from inhibition of prolidase activity that may occur through inhibition of alpha2beta1 integrin and IGF-IR signaling.",

In various pathological states such as hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke, plasma levels of ADMA may be increased and lead to inhibition of NO synthesis and endothelial dysfunction. Inhibition of ADMA synthesis or intensification of metabolism of this compound might indirectly lower ADMA. Antioxidants, estrogen, vitamin A, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists, and also some hypolipemic, hypoglycemic and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs decrease ADMA levels. In some situations like neurological disorders, decreased plasma levels of ADMA are noticed and drugs increasing the concentration of this compound could exert protective effects. It is reasonable to explore which drugs can increase or decrease ADMA levels and what their mechanism of that action is.",

However, there are no unified criteria to evaluate meta-analysis. Thus, we developed and evaluated objective criteria of meta-analysis paper. Meta-analysis was evaluated from the standpoint of format and quality. Format score was developed based on QUOROM statement. Quality scores were evaluated in each step of meta-analysis. We evaluated meta-analysis for advantageous or adverse effect in the relationship between Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor and diabetes mellitus. Research articles either in English or Japanese were searched in PubMed and the Cochrane Library in July 2009. Fifty-five studies were evaluated for format and quality score. Format score was 64.5+/-25.3% (Mean+/-S.D.), and quality score was 57.1+/-21.6%. After plotting each score along the X-Y coordinate, format score was correlated with quality score (R2=0.702, p<0.001). In studies with quality score of 70% or higher, RAS inhibitor prevented new-onset diabetes mellitus. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor reduced risk of myocardial infarction, however, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) increased the incidence in odds ratio 1.21 (95%CI: 1.04-1.40). We evaluated meta-analysis by format and quality score, and these factors showed correlation. Therefore, assessment of quality score leads to prompt and reliable evaluation of meta-analysis. According to articles evaluated by quality score, RAS inhibitor showed effectiveness on diabetes mellitus.

Rats were treated with subcutaneous injection of isoprenaline (5 mg/kg/d) and with oral administration of captopril (30 mg/kg/d) or telmisartan (3 mg/kg/d) for 1 or 7 d. Hearts were excised at the day 2 and day 8. Degree of fibrosis was evaluated by Azan staining. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions were analyzed by Western blotting. Localization of MMP-9 expression in LV section was detected by immunohistochemical staining. At the day 8, myocardial fibrosis was observed in LV section from isoprenaline-treated rats. Captopril but not telmisartan significantly enhanced the isoprenaline-induced myocardial fibrosis. MMP-9 expression at the day 2 and MMP-2 expression at the day 8 increased significantly in LV from isoprenaline-treated rats. Captopril had no influence on the MMP-2 expression, but significantly augmented the isoprenaline-induced MMP-9 expression. Telmisartan had no effect on the isoprenaline-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions. In immunohistochemical staining, MMP-9 positive-interstitial cells were extensively observed in LV sections from isoprenaline + captopril-treated rats at the day 2. The present study reveals that RAS blockade by captopril and telmisartan does not have suppressive effects on isoprenaline-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions as well as LV fibrosis. Furthermore, captopril may enhance LV fibrosis through promoting isoprenaline-induced MMP-9 expression in cardiac interstitial cells.",

The key messages of this report are: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of >140 mmHg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP (DBP); beginning at 115/75 mmHg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mmHg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90 percent lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (SBP 120\u2013139 mmHg or DBP 80\u201389 mmHg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions, which are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mmHg, or <130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease); for patients whose BP is >20 mmHg above the SBP goal or 10 mmHg above the DBP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will only be controlled if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan.

Based on their benefits in other populations, blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are an attractive treatment option. The evidence that RAAS blockers improve surrogate end points is mixed. However, a recent meta-analysis found significant improvement in left ventricular mass with RAAS-blocking drugs in hemodialysis patients. Only a few trials have examined RAAS-blocking drugs and cardiovascular events in dialysis patients, and a recent meta-analysis found no significant benefit in hemodialysis patients. The single trial of peritoneal dialysis patients that reported cardiovascular events found no benefit from RAAS blockers. Fortunately, the risk of hyperkalemia appears low. Based on the available evidence, we cannot categorically recommend that all hypertensive dialysis patients be treated with RAAS blockers. We await the results of adequately powered clinical trials.", 
    "593": "Protein and lipid oxidation-mainly by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS)-was proposed as a crucial determinant of health and lifespan. Angiotensin II (Ang II) enhances ROS production by activating NAD(P)H oxidase and uncoupling endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Ang II also stimulates mtROS production, which depresses mitochondrial energy metabolism. In rodents, renin-angiotensin system blockade (RAS blockade) increases survival and prevents age-associated changes. RAS blockade reduces mtROS and enhances mitochondrial content and function. This suggests that Ang II contributes to the ageing process by prompting mitochondrial dysfunction. Since Ang II is a pleiotropic peptide, the age-protecting effects of RAS blockade are expected to involve a variety of other mechanisms. Caloric restriction (CR)-an age-retarding intervention in humans and animals-and RAS blockade display a number of converging effects, i.e. they delay the manifestations of hypertension, diabetes, nephropathy, cardiovascular disease, and cancer; increase body temperature; reduce body weight, plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-1; ameliorate insulin sensitivity; lower protein, lipid, and DNA oxidation, and mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production; and increase uncoupling protein-2 and sirtuin expression. A number of these overlapping effects involve changes in mitochondrial function. In CR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) seem to contribute to age-retardation partly by regulating mitochondrial function. RAS inhibition up-regulates PPARs; therefore, it is feasible that PPAR modulation is pivotal for mitochondrial protection by RAS blockade during rodent ageing. Other potential mechanisms that may underlie RAS blockade's mitochondrial benefits are TGF-\u03b2 down-regulation and up-regulation of Klotho and sirtuins. In conclusion, the available data suggest that RAS blockade deserves further research efforts to establish its role as a potential tool to mitigate the growing problem of age-associated chronic disease.", 
    "594": "Anaphylaxis is the most severe type of food allergy. Factors of risk are advanced age, cardiopathy, asthma, mastocytosis. Age may be linked to an increased consumption of drugs: aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). A case-control study comparing anaphylaxis and mild food allergies has shown a sharp increase of consumption of these drugs in patients with anaphylaxis, with odds ratio respectively of 10.8 [CI 95%: 3.10-41.3], 8.2 [CI 95%: 1.37-62.51], 6.8 [CI 95%: 1.78-27.78] and 13 [CI 95%: 1.34-310.38]. Besides, exercise potentiates the relative risk of drug consumption. Predominant mechanisms could be an increase of gut permeability enhancing the passage of food allergens in the mucosa and in blood, and the inhibition of ACE, so that the angiotensin homeostatic mechanism deteriorates. Main sites of interference may be endothelium and gut epithelium. Preventive measures excluding the intake of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs before the meals can be recommended for food allergic and food sensitized adults.

Although inhibitors of well-established protease targets such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and HIV protease have shown substantial therapeutic success, developing drugs for new protease targets has proved challenging in recent years. This in part could be due to issues such as the difficulty of achieving selectivity when targeting protease active sites. This Perspective discusses the general principles in protease-based drug discovery, highlighting the lessons learned and the emerging strategies, such as targeting allosteric sites, which could help harness the therapeutic potential of new protease targets.", 
    "618": "Current evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have emerged as novel drugs for preventing the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). A meta-analysis was performed of 26 randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of ACEIs or ARBs on the prevention of AF. Overall, ACEIs and ARBs revealed statistically significant preventive effects on AF (odds ratio (OR), 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55-0.76). The preventive effect was similar in the two classes of drugs (ACEI: OR, 0.68; ARB: OR, 0.69). ACEIs and ARBs showed greater preventive effects on recurrent AF (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.31-0.65) than on new-onset AF (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.92). Prevention was greatest in patients with AF who were receiving amiodarone as a basic treatment drug (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26-0.48). In patients with heart failure, there appeared to be a large effect (OR, 0.497), but the credible interval (CrI) limits were wide (95% CrI, 0.187-1.161).",

Eleven clinical trials that randomized mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients to treatment with telmisartan 40/80 mg, losartan 50 mg, valsartan 80/160 mg, ramipril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy, or with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5/25 mg, were included. Treatment duration ranged from 4 to 14 weeks. The smoothness index was calculated according to the published formula.", 
    "621": "Altogether, 5188 patients were included (65% men; 52% were using telmisartan as monotherapy or in combination with HCTZ). Telmisartan 80 mg had a higher smoothness index than losartan, valsartan or ramipril (P < 0.05), and was comparable with amlodipine. All combination therapies had a higher smoothness index than monotherapy; the largest value was observed with telmisartan 80 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg. Overall, the smoothness index was lower in men, older patients, black patients, smokers and in those with lower baseline blood pressure (P < 0.05).", 
    "622": "The smoothness index was affected by age, race, sex, behavioural and haemodynamic factors. It was also able to differentiate the 24-h blood pressure effects of antihypertensive drugs, with telmisartan and amlodipine achieving the highest values, possibly because of their long plasma half-lives. All combination therapies had a higher smoothness index than monotherapy. An understanding of the relative effects of different antihypertensives on the smoothness index may help to differentiate their effectiveness in reducing blood pressure-related cardiovascular risk.", 
    "623": "The kidney is an important target for the actions of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and this tissue contains a complete local RAS that expresses the bioactive peptides angiotensin II (ANG II) and Ang-(1-7). We find both angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)R) and type 2 (AT(2)R) receptors expressed on renal nuclei that stimulate reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (NO), respectively. Since Ang-(1-7) also exhibits actions within the kidney and the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor protein contains a nuclear localization sequence, we determined the expression of Ang-(1-7) receptors in nuclei isolated from the kidneys of young adult sheep. Binding studies with (125)I-[Sar(1)Thr(8)]-ANG II revealed sites sensitive to the Ang-(1-7) antagonist [d-Ala(7)]-Ang-(1-7) (DALA, A779), as well as to AT(2) and AT(1) antagonists. Incubation of Ang-(1-7) [10(-15) to 10(-9) M] with isolated cortical nuclei elicited a dose-dependent increase in the fluorescence of the NO indicator [4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7']-difluorofluorescein diacetate. The NO response to Ang-(1-7) was abolished by the NO inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and DALA, but not the AT(1) antagonist losartan or the AT(2) blocker PD123319. Immunofluorescent studies utilizing the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor antibody revealed immunolabeling of the proximal tubules but not staining within the glomerulus in cortical sections of the sheep kidney. In the nuclear fraction of isolated proximal tubules, immunoblots revealed the precursor angiotensinogen and renin, as well as functional activity for ACE, ACE2, and neprilysin. We conclude that renal nuclei express Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptors that are functionally linked to NO formation. The marked sensitivity of the intracellular NO response to Ang-(1-7) implicates a functional role of the Ang-(1-7) axis within the nucleus. Moreover, evidence for the precursor and enzymatic components of the RAS within the nuclear compartment of the proximal tubules provides a potential pathway for the intracellular generation of Ang-(1-7).", 
    "624": "Human carboxylesterase (CES) 1A is responsible for the biotransformation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as imidapril and temocapril. Because antidiabetic or antihyperlipidemic drugs are often coadministered with ACE inhibitors in clinical pharmacotherapy, the inhibitory effect of these drugs on CES1A1 enzyme activity was investigated. In addition, the inhibitory effect on CES2 enzyme activity was evaluated to compare it with that on CES1A1. The inhibitory effects were evaluated with 11 antidiabetic and 12 antihyperlipidemic drugs. The imidapril hydrolase activity by recombinant CES1A1 was substantially inhibited by lactone ring-containing statins such as simvastatin and lovastatin and thiazolidinediones such as troglitazone and rosiglitazone. The activity in human liver microsomes was also strongly inhibited by simvastatin and troglitazone (K(i) = 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 and 5.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, respectively). However, statins containing no lactone ring such as pravastatin and fluvastatin did not show strong inhibition. 7-Ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidono)-1-piperidono]carbonyloxycamptothecin hydrolase activity by recombinant human CES2 was substantially inhibited by fenofibrate (K(i) = 0.04 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcM) as well as by simvastatin (0.67 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcM). Other fibrates such as clinofibrate and bezafibrate did not show strong inhibition. Thus, the inhibitory effects of the thiazolidinediones and fenofibrate on CES1A1 and CES2 were different. Some statins such as simvastatin and lovastatin, thiazolidinediones, and fenofibrate might attenuate the drug efficacy of prodrugs biotransformed by CES1A and CES2.",

The adiponectin gene is located in chromosome 3q27, a susceptibility locus for T2DM and metabolic disorders (Saito K, Tobe T, Minoshima S, Asakawa S, Sumiya J, Yoda M, Nakano Y, Shimizu N, Tomita M: Organization of the gene for gelatin-binding protein (GBP28). Gene 1999, 229:67-73). Increased circulating levels of adiponectin are associated with improvement in the metabolic syndrome and reductions are strongly predictive of diabetes risk (Li S, Shin HJ, Ding EL, van Dam RM: Adiponectin levels and risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. JAMA 2009, 302:179-188. Extensive efforts have been made to understand how adiponectin levels can be elevated. The complex post-translational processing and secretion of adiponectin provides a rich area where pharmacologic manipulation may be developed to increase adiponectin levels in humans. Circulating adiponectin levels are increased by many commonly used drugs, such as statins, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) providing an important opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying their effects. This review describes the cellular processes by which adiponectin is synthesized and secreted, current therapeutics known to affect this pathway and the potential for therapeutic manipulation in human subjects.",

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of atorvastatin/day (64) or placebo (68) and were followed with trial visits 3-monthly for a mean of 2.5 yrs. The primary outcome was the rate of both MDRD eGFR and Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance (C-G CrCl) decline. Analysis was based on intention to treat and included all patients that had at least one follow-up visit.",

Although blood pressure decreased in both atorvastatin and placebo-treated groups there were no differences between groups. In addition, there was no difference in concomitant medication intake including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers between groups.", 
    "629": "There was a trend toward a slower eGFR decline in the atorvastatin-treated group that did not reach statistical significance. This may have been due to the lack of power of the study.

PDDIs were analysed using a computerized program and categorized according to level of severity, onset, mechanism and documentation in the literature. The STATA software statistical package was used for data analysis, and logistic regression was conducted to determine whether variables were associated with PDDIs.",

Almost two-thirds (64.4%) of the elderly population exposed to PDDIs were women, 50.7% were aged >or=75 years, 71.7% reported having fair or poor health and 65.8% took 2-5 medications. A total of 125 different PDDIs were identified; the treatment combination of an ACE inhibitor with a thiazide or loop diuretic (associated with hypotension) was the most frequent cause of PDDIs (n = 322 patients; 56.7% of individuals with PDDIs). Analysis of the PDDIs revealed that 70.4% were of moderate severity, 64.8% were supported by good quality evidence and 56.8% were considered of delayed onset. The multivariate analysis showed that the risk of a PDDI was significantly increased among elderly individuals using six or more medications (odds ratio [OR] 3.37) and in patients with hypertension (OR 2.56), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.73) or heart problems (OR 3.36).",

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers have been indispensable in diminishing the macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes. In addition, cumulative evidence from retrospective studies pointed toward a beneficial effect of RAS agents in preventing the development and progression of T2DM. This disease-modifying potential of RAS blockers has been substantiated by recent prospective trials. Contemporary concepts regarding the natural history of T2DM and the pathophysiologic processes involved have increased our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of these agents in diabetes management. In addition to their established roles in the primary prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes, RAS blockers might be considered a suitable therapeutic choice for preventing the development of frank diabetes in high-risk patients.",

We assessed whether two dietary patterns were effective in lowering BP in persons on antihypertensive therapy and in those not on therapy. Ninety-four participants (38/56 females/males), aged 55\u00b76 (SD 9\u00b79) years, consumed two 4-week dietary regimens in random order (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet and low- Na high-K (LNAHK) diet) with a control diet before each phase. Seated home BP was measured daily for the last 2 weeks in each phase. Participants were grouped based on antihypertensive drug therapy. The LNAHK diet produced a greater fall in systolic BP (SBP) in those on antihypertensive therapy (-6\u00b72 (SD 6\u00b70) mmHg) than in those not on antihypertensive therapy (-2\u00b78 (SD 4\u00b70) mmHg) (P = 0\u00b7036), and this was greatest for those on renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker therapy (-9\u00b75 (SD 6\u00b74) mmHg) (interaction P = 0\u00b7007). The fall in SBP on the DASH-type diet, in those on therapy (overall -1\u00b71 (SD 6\u00b72) mmHg; renin-angiotensin blocker therapy -4\u00b72 (SD 4\u00b77) mmHg), was not as marked as that observed on the LNAHK diet. Dietary modifications are an important part of all hypertension management regimens, and a low-Na and high-K diet enhances the BP-lowering effect of antihypertensive medications, particularly those targeting the RAS.",

Time frame for stopping dual antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary interventions, methods of glycaemic control and bridging protocol for patients on oral anticoagulants are also provided. We emphasise the importance of prompt implementation of the above guidelines as the number of surgical procedures being performed in high risk patients (including the elderly) constantly rises.",

Normative blood pressure data is available for different ages, sexes and heights, the diagnosis of hypertension should be based on these values. It is recommended that all children over the age of 3 years should have blood pressure measured whenever seen by a doctor. Essential hypertension can occur in children, but hypertension secondary to an underlying cause (most often renal) is more likely. Secondary hypertension tends to be more severe, sustained and at times uncontrolled. Evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination and certain basic laboratory tests. All attempts should be made to look for the etiology in cases where secondary hypertension is suspected. Management of hypertension in children must incorporate non pharamacological measures including weight reduction, exercise and dietary modifications. Pharamacological treatment is indicated for; a) symptomatic hypertension, b) if there is evidence of end organ damage and c) for those unresponsive to nonpharmacological treatment. A number of drugs are available for children with hypertension; commonly used ones are calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics.

Since the 1980s, the prognosis of NC has dramatically improved after the introduction of cysteamine treatment. Limited data are available documenting improvement in prognosis. We reviewed our long-term data (follow-up 6.3-27.8 years) on 23 patients followed in the past 26 years. Overall, stage III CRF was reached at 10 years of age in >90% of patients, whereas >80% reached end-stage renal disease before the age of 14 years. Three patients died during the follow-up. Our analysis shows a clear improvement in renal outcome (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and linear growth (p\u2009=\u20090.04) in patients treated more recently. Improvement in the evolution of renal function was significantly associated with early initiation of cysteamine (p\u2009=\u20090.006), with the dose of cysteamine (p\u2009=\u20090.04), and with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Nonrenal long-term complications are similar to previously reported data. Of note, 3/23 patients developed rare forms of primary tumors that were successfully treated.

The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of EBTs for the prevention of CVD events in older people and secondarily whether a Home Medicines Review (HMR) service by pharmacists' predicts the use of these medicines. A retrospective cross-sectional audit of HMR reports pertaining to 608 community-dwelling older people (>or=65 years) was conducted. EBTs considered for this audit included four guideline-recommended therapies for CVD: antithrombotic therapy (warfarin +/- antiplatelet therapy), beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEI] +/- angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]). The prevalence of EBT use among the older people, mean age (SD) 75.6 (7.5) years, was: 73% for antithrombotic therapy, 75% for statins, 74% for angiotensin therapy, and 35% for beta-blockers. CVD risk factors warranting treatment with these EBTs were frequently associated with use of EBTs. EBTs were least likely to be used in those with coronary interventions like coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)/stent insertion (all EBTs except angiotensin agents) and angiotensin agents in those with a history of myocardial infarction or chronic heart failure. A pharmacist-led HMR service was significantly associated with the prescribing of all 4 EBTs. The results from this study show good adherence to evidence-based guidelines in general, although there is still room for improvement to further optimize clinical outcomes in these complex patients.

The effect of the mobile phase composition on the ionization constant was studied by measuring the pK(a) at different methanol-water mixtures, ranging between 50 and 65% (v/v), using LC-DAD method. Two simple, accurate, precise and fully validated analytical methods for the simultaneous determination of enalapril and lercanidipine in combined dosage forms have been developed. Separation was performed on an X-Terra RP-18 column (250 mm x 4.60mm ID x 5 microm) at 40 degrees C with the mobile phase of methanol-water 55:45 (v/v) adjusted to pH 2.7 with 15 mM orthophosphoric acid. Isocratic elution was performed in less than 12 min with a flow rate of 1.2 mL min(-1). Good sensitivity for the analytes was observed with DAD detection. The LC method allowed quantitation over the 0.50-20.00 microg mL(-1) range for enalapril and lercanidipine. The second method depends on first derivative of the ratio-spectra by measurements of the amplitudes at 219.7 nm for enalapril and 233.0 nm for lercanidipine. Calibration graphs were established for 1-20 microg mL(-1) for enalapril and 1-16 microg mL(-1) lercanidipine, using first derivative of the ratio spectrophotometric method. Both methods have been extensively validated. These methods allow a number of cost and time saving benefits. The described methods can be readily utilized for analysis of pharmaceutical formulations. The methods have been applied, without any interference from excipients, for the simultaneous determination of these compounds in tablets.

Beta-blockers should be given if coronary artery disease is present. Exercise rehabilitation programs and cilostazol improve exercise time until the onset of intermittent claudication. Indications for lower-extremity angioplasty, preferably with stenting, or bypass surgery are incapacitating claudication interfering with work or lifestyle in patients; limb salvage in patients with limb-threatening ischemia as manifested by rest pain, nonhealing ulcers, infection, or gangrene; and vasculogenic impotence.", 
    "663": "Hypertension is a well-recognized complication of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of blood pressure; however, data on the RAS in ARPKD are limited and conflicting, showing both up- and down-regulation. In the current study, we characterized intrarenal and systemic RAS activation in relationship to hypertension and progressive cystic kidney disease in the ARPKD orthologous polycystic kidney (PCK) rat. Clinical and histological measures of kidney disease, kidney RAS gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, angiotensin II (Ang II) immunohistochemistry, and systemic Ang I and II levels were assessed in 2-, 4-, and 6-month-old cystic PCK and age-matched normal rats. PCK rats developed hypertension and progressive cystic kidney disease without significant worsening of renal function or relative kidney size. Intrarenal renin, ACE and Ang II expression was increased significantly in cystic kidneys; angiotensinogen and Ang II Type I receptor were unchanged. Systemic Ang I and II levels did not differ. This study demonstrates that intrarenal, but not systemic, RAS activation is a prominent feature of ARPKD. These findings help reconcile previous conflicting reports and suggest that intrarenal renin and ACE gene upregulation may represent a novel mechanism for hypertension development or exacerbation in ARPKD.",

    "668": "Patients with CKD exhibit significant within-patient hemoglobin (Hb) level variability, especially with the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron. Analyses of dialysis cohorts in the United States produced conflicting results regarding the association of Hb variability with patient outcomes. Here, we determined Hb variability in 5037 European hemodialysis (HD) patients treated over 2 years to identify predictors of high variability and to evaluate its association with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. We assessed Hb variability with various methods using SD, residual SD, time-in-target (11.0 to 12.5 g/dl), fluctuation across thresholds, and area under the curve (AUC). Hb variability was significantly greater among incident patients than prevalent patients. Compared with previously described cohorts in the United States, residual SD was similar but fluctuations above target were less frequent. Using logistic regression, age, body mass index, CVD history, dialysis vintage, serum albumin, Hb, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use, ESA use, dialysis access type, dialysis access change, and hospitalizations were significant predictors of high variability. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression showed that SD, residual SD, time-in-target, and AUC did not predict all-cause or CVD mortality during a median follow-up of 12.4 months (IQR: 7.7 to 17.4). However, patients with consistently low levels of Hb (<11 g/dl) and those who fluctuated between the target range and <11 g/dl had increased risks for death (RR 2.34; 95% CI: 1.24 to 4.41 and RR 1.74; 95% CI: 1.00 to 3.04, respectively). In conclusion, although Hb variability is common in European HD patients, it does not independently predict mortality.", 
    "669": "Angiotensin (Ang)II, the effector arm of the locally active renin-angiotensin system (RAS), modulates Tissue Factor (TF), the principal initiator of blood coagulation and a key promoter of atherothrombotic events. Consistent with that knowledge, previous data showed inhibitory properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)s and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker (ARB)s, but no data are available about the effect of renin inhibition. We aimed to evaluate whether aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor (DRI), modulates TNF-\u03b1-stimulated TF expression in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Zofenopril, an ACEI, and olmesartan, an ARB, were the controls. HUVECs were incubated with experimental drugs (1 nM) 30 min prior to TNF-\u03b1 stimulation (0.1 ng/ml \u00d7 4 h). Main evaluation variables were procoagulant activity (single-stage clotting assay), TF antigen (ELISA) and mRNA expression (real-time polymerase chain reaction) in cell lysates. TNF-\u03b1 stimulated procoagulant activity and increased TF antigen and mRNA expression. Aliskiren inhibited TNF-\u03b1-mediated TF stimulation; zofenopril and olmesartan exerted a comparable effect. We conclude that aliskiren, a DRI, downregulates TNF-\u03b1-stimulated TF expression in HUVECs, possibly as a reflection of endothelial renin activation by the cytokine.",

Daily C16 administration from postoperative days 2 to 28 at a dose that inhibited myocardial ACE2 activity was associated with a significant increase in MI size and reduction in LV % fractional shortening. Treatment with C16 did not significantly affect post-MI increases in LV end-diastolic dimension but did inhibit increases in wall thickness and fibrosis in non-infarcted LV. On postoperative day 7, C16 had no significant effect on the increased level of apoptosis in the infarct and border zones nor did it significantly affect capillary density surrounding the MI. It did, however, significantly reduce the number of c-kit(+) cells in the border region.",

First, the starting SBA-15 materials are examined to verify that their synthesis has been successful considering the structural properties, using XRD, FTIR, and BET methods. Second, the influence of processing parameters of ordered mesoporous matrices for the loading and release of captopril was investigated. The release of captopril was controlled by tailoring the surface properties of the mesoporous silica via functionalization. The loading and release kinetics (in vitro in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids) showed that both of them were affected by the surface properties of the mesoporous silica materials. Such a formulation shows potential as an efficient controlled drug delivery system.", 
    "674": "We investigated water drinking and arterial blood pressure responses to intravenous infusions of ANG II in young (4 mo), middle-aged adult (12 mo), and old (29 mo) male Brown Norway rats. Infusions of ANG II began with arterial blood pressure either at control levels or at reduced levels following injection of the vasodilator minoxidil. Under control conditions, mean arterial pressure (MAP) in response to ANG II rose to the same level for all groups, and middle-aged and old rats drank as much or more water in response to ANG II compared with young rats, depending on whether intakes were analyzed using absolute or body weight-adjusted values. When arterial blood pressure first was reduced with minoxidil, MAP in response to ANG II stabilized at significantly lower levels compared with control conditions for all groups. Young rats drank significantly more water under reduced pressure conditions compared with control conditions, while middle-aged and old rats did not. Urine volume in response to ANG II was lower, while water balance was higher, under conditions of reduced pressure compared with control conditions. Baroreflex control of heart rate was substantially reduced in old rats compared with young and middle-aged animals. In summary, young rats appear to be more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of increased arterial blood pressure on water drinking than are older animals.", 
    "675": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of fresh garlic homogenate (FGH) and its bioactive sulphur compound S-allyl cysteine sulphoxide (SACS) in potentiating antihypertensive and cardioprotective activities of captopril in rats. SACS was extracted from the fresh garlic using ion exchange resins with yield of 890 mg/kg garlic. The dose of SACS was calculated based on the amount of SACS extracted from 125 to 250 mg of FGH. Albino rats weighing 150-200 g were fed with 10% fructose in fluid for 3 weeks for induction of hypertension and subsequently administered FGH (125 and 250 mg/kg, p.o.) or SACS (0.111 and 0.222 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for the next 3 weeks in their respective groups. In CAP alone and interactive groups (GH+CAP; SACS+CAP), captopril 30 mg/kg was given during sixth week of 10% fructose in fluid. At the end of drug treatment, animals were given isoproterenol 175 mg/kg subcutaneously for two consecutive days. Additionally, varying concentrations of SACS (4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ng), CAP (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 ng) and their combination (4:1) were checked for fall in blood pressure in hypertensive rats (10% fructose in fluid without pretreatment) as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting activity using guinea pig ileum. An isobolographic analysis was used to characterise the interaction between SACS and CAP for fall in blood pressure and ACE inhibiting evaluations. Administration of captopril, low and high doses of FGH (125, 250 mg/kg), either alone or together showed fall in fluid intake and body weight. The combined therapy of FGH 250 mg/kg and CAP was more effective in reducing systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose. The SOD and catalase activities in heart tissue were significantly elevated in groups treated with FGH, SACS, CAP, FGH+CAP and SACS+CAP. Further, combined therapy of FGH 250 mg/kg and CAP caused significant fall in LDH and CK-MB activities in serum and elevation in heart tissue homogenate. SACS in low dose was less effective than low dose of FGH; similarly, high dose of FGH was more efficacious than high dose of SACS. Corroborating with this, combined therapy of garlic (250 mg/kg) with CAP demonstrated higher synergistic action than combination of SACS (0.222 mg/kg) with CAP suggesting the role of additional bioactive constituents apart from SACS, responsible for therapeutic efficacy of garlic. Moreover, combination of SACS and CAP exerted super-additive (synergistic) interaction with respect to fall in blood pressure and ACE inhibition. This study may represent an advertence on concomitant use of garlic or its bioactive constituent, SACS, with captopril.",

    "682": "Tebipenem pivoxil (TBPM-PI) is an oral carbapenem antibiotic for treating otolaryngologic and respiratory infections in pediatric patients. This agent is a prodrug to improve intestinal absorption of TBPM, an active form, and an absorption rate of TBPM-PI is higher than those of other prodrug-type \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. In the present study, we hypothesized that a certain mechanism other than simple diffusion is involved in the process of improved intestinal absorption of TBPM-PI and examined the mechanism. TBPM-PI uptake by Caco-2 cells was decreased by ATP-depletion and lowering the temperature to 4 \u00b0C, suggesting the contribution of carrier-mediated transport mechanisms. This uptake was partially decreased by ACE inhibitors, and the reduction of the absorption by captopril was observed by in vivo study and in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion study in rat, supporting the contribution of influx transporters. Since some ACE inhibitors and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are reported to be substrates of PEPT and OATP families, we measured transporting activity of TBPM-PI by intestinally expressed transporters, PEPT1, OATP1A2, and OATP2B1. As a result, significant transport activities were observed by both OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 but not by PEPT1. Interestingly, pH dependence of TBPM-PI transports was different between OATP1A2 and OATP2B1, showing highest activity by OATP1A2 at pH 6.5, while OATP2B1-mediated uptake was higher at neutral and weak alkaline pH. OATP1A2 exhibited higher affinity for TBPM-PI (K(m) = 41.1 \u03bcM) than OATP2B1 (K(m) > 1 mM) for this agent. These results suggested that TBPM-PI has high intestinal apical membrane permeability due to plural intestinal transport routes, including the uptake transporters such as OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 as well as simple diffusion.",

Combinations of ACEIs and ARBs have been shown to be superior than to either agent alone for some, but certainly not all, composite cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, but dual RAAS blockade with the combination of an ACEI and an ARB is sometimes associated with an increase in the risk for adverse events, primarily hyperkalemia and worsening renal function. The recent introduction of the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, has made available new combination strategies to obtain a more complete blockade of the RAAS with fewer adverse events.

The study of nonantiarrhythmic drugs that act on the atrial remodeling that constitutes the substrate of the arrhythmia is a new and very interesting field of research. In this regard, several molecules that interact with the renin-angiotensin system at the level of the enzymatic or receptor cascade have been investigated in the past 10 years; some results have been very promising, whereas others have been extremely disappointing. In particular, the publication in 2008 of the results of GISSI AF, a rigorously designed Italian prospective study conducted on a large number of patients, revealed no statistically significant differences between the active drug and a placebo in preventing arrhythmia recurrences.

Renal tissue of ARR revealed enhanced expression of nephrin protein and mRNA. This effect of ALD was inhibited by EPL, but not by TEL or AML. Conclusions.

The main strategy for minimizing cardiotoxicity is early detection of high-risk patients and prompt prophylactic treatment.

Measurement of cardiospecific biomarkers can be a valid diagnostic tool for early identification, assessment, and monitoring of cardiotoxicity. In particular, the role of troponin in identifying patients at risk of cardiotoxicity and of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing cardiac dysfunction and cardiac events is clearly emerging as a new effective approach. Therefore, we propose troponin as a criterion standard marker for the assessment of cardiac risk of both old and new antineoplastic treatments, and its evaluation should be included among the criteria utilized to define cardiotoxicity.",

She did not have any previous history of drug allergies. The patient was managed with epinephrine. Although angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis are well documented adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, very few cases of these adverse reactions with ARBs have been reported in medical literature.", 
    "713": "Current national and international guidelines for patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are mainly based on the results of randomised clinical trials. However, it is well perceived that patients in such trials often represent a low risk population. Therefore the results of randomised clinical trials are not necessarily applicable to patients in clinical practice. This gap can be filled by prospective registries. Since the early nineties a number of prospective large registries in patients with STEMI have been performed in Germany. It could be shown that guideline adherent acute therapies and secondary prevention therapies were associated with an improvement in inhospital and mid-term outcomes. The benefit of guideline adherent therapy observed was especially high in patients with higher baseline risk. Registries are not able to replace randomised clinical trials, but can help to test if the results of these trials are comprehensible in clinical practice. Therefore prospective STEMI registries are an important part of clinical research to optimize therapies and improve outcome in patients with STEMI.",

BP responses to the addition of second-line therapy also differed significantly by ethnic group (interaction test P = 0.004). On adding a diuretic to atenolol, BP lowering was similar among blacks and South-Asians as compared to whites (referent).

To investigate whether PP is associated with endothelial function in subjects with no apparent heart disease we prospectively assessed brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in 525 consecutive subjects with no apparent heart disease [323 (61%) men, mean age 52 +/- 11 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 26 +/- 4 kg/m(2)]. Following an overnight fast and discontinuation of all medications for >/= 12 hours, the FMD and endothelium-independent, nitroglycerin-mediated vasodilation (NTG) were assessed using high-resolution linear array ultrasound. Univariate linear analysis revealed a significant inverse association between FMD and PP (r = -0.65, p < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (r = -0.52, p < 0.01) and age (r = -0.21, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that PP was the strongest independent predictor of FMD. We therefore divided the study population into two groups: group A (n = 290) </= the median PP, and group B (n = 235) > the median PP of 50 mmHg. Male sex, hypertension, diabetes, BMI, heart rate, and the use of aspirin, long-acting nitrates, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers were significantly more common in Group B compared with Group A.

However, no studies have evaluated the benefit of pre-event use of RAS inhibitors before STEMI. A retrospective review was performed of patients admitted to a single hospital with the diagnosis of STEMI and without a history of coronary disease or the equivalent, including diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, or stroke. Patients were stratified according to the use of RAS inhibitors before STEMI. Compared to patients not taking RAS inhibitors, patients who were taking RAS inhibitors had a lower peak troponin I level (79 vs 120 ng/dl, p = 0.016). Of the patients who had medically treated hypertension, those receiving RAS inhibitors had a significantly lower peak troponin I compared to those receiving non-RAS agents (79 vs 130 ng/dl, p = 0.015), despite equivalent blood pressure across the 2 groups. The beneficial effect of RAS inhibitor pretreatment remained when concomitant aspirin and statin use were controlled for. In conclusion, in patients presenting with a first STEMI, pretreatment with RAS inhibitors conferred a cardioprotective effect. The mechanism of this benefit appears to be independent of an effect on blood pressure control and was not wholly due to the effect of concomitant use of other medicines known to be protective in patients with STEMI.",

A multimodal intervention is required to afford renoprotection in overt diabetic nephropathy. Here we assessed the effects of maximal RAS inhibition by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) in combination with statin in rats with overt diabetic nephropathy. Uninephrectomized rats made diabetic by streptozotocin were orally treated from 4 (when proteinuria and renal lesions had developed) to 8 mo with vehicle, lisinopril plus candesartan, lisinopril plus candesartan plus rosuvastatin, or rosuvastatin alone. Systolic blood pressure increased in diabetic rats and was significantly lowered by combined therapies. Dual RAS blockade significantly reduced proteinuria compared with vehicle. Addition of statin further lowered proteinuria to control levels. Glomerulosclerosis was ameliorated by RAS inhibitors or statin, and regression was achieved by the addition of statin. Loss of podocytes of diabetic rats was limited by ACE inhibitor plus ARB while normalized by the three drugs. Defective nephrin expression of diabetes was increased by dual RAS blockade or statin and restored by the triple therapy. Tubular damage, interstitial inflammation, and expression of the fibrotic markers transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and phosphorylated Smad 2/3 in tubuli were significantly reduced by the triple regimen.

    "754": "Inhalation exposure to fine concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) increases cardiac oxidants by mechanisms involving modulation of the sympathovagal tone on the heart. Angiotensin-II is a potent vasoconstrictor and a sympatho-excitatory peptide involved in the regulation of blood pressure. We hypothesized that increases in angiotensin-II after fine particulate matter (PM) exposure could be involved in the development of cardiac oxidative stress. Adult rats were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (benazepril), or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; valsartan) before exposure to fine PM aerosols or filtered air. Exposures were carried out for 5 hours in the chamber of the Harvard fine particle concentrator (fine PM mass concentration: 440 +/- 80 microg/m(3)). At the end of the exposure the animals were tested for in situ chemiluminescence (CL) of the heart, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and for plasma levels of angiotensin-II. Also, continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were collected on a subgroup of exposed animals. PM exposure was associated with statistically significant increases in plasma angiotensin concentrations. Pre-treatment with the ACE inhibitor effectively lowered angiotensin concentration, whereas ARB treatment led to increases in angiotensin above the PM-only level. PM exposure also led to significant increases in heart oxidative stress (CL, TBARS), and a shortening of the T-end to T-peak interval on the ECG that were prevented by treatment with both the ACE inhibitor and ARB. These results show that ambient fine particles can increase plasma levels of angiotensin-II and suggest a role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of particle-related acute cardiac events.",

Captopril, a potent and selective angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a well known antihypertensive drug. Besides the peripheral renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE inhibitors are also suggested to affect the brain RAS which might participate in the regulation of seizure susceptibility. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of captopril on the protective action of numerous antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine [CBZ], phenytoin [PHT], valproate [VPA], phenobarbital [PB], oxcarbazepine [OXC], lamotrigine [LTG] and topiramate [TPM]) against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice. This study was accompanied by an evaluation of adverse effects of combined treatment with captopril and antiepileptic drugs in the passive avoidance task and chimney test. Captopril (25 and 50 mg/kg i.p.) did not influence the threshold for electroconvulsions. Among the tested antiepileptics, captopril (25 and 50 mg/kg i.p.) potentiated the antiseizure action of CBZ, decreasing its ED(50) value from 12.1 to 8.9 and 8.7 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, captopril (50 mg/kg i.p.) enhanced the anticonvulsant activity of LTG. ED(50) value for LTG was lowered from 5.1 to 3.5 mg/kg. The observed interactions between captopril and CBZ or LTG were pharmacodynamic in nature as captopril did not alter plasma and total brain concentrations of these antiepileptics. The combinations of captopril with antiepileptic drugs did not lead to retention deficits in the passive avoidance task or motor impairment in the chimney test. Based on the current preclinical data, it is suggested that captopril may positively interact with CBZ and LTG in epileptic patients. The combinations of captopril with the remaining antiepileptics (PHT, VPA, PB, OXC and TPM) seem neutral.", 
    "762": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are among the most commonly used drugs in stable coronary artery disease as these agents have been proven to be effective for reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As with other drugs, individual variation in treatment benefit is likely. Such heterogeneity could be used to target ACE-inhibitor therapy to those patients most likely to benefit from treatment. However, prior attempts to target ACE-inhibitor therapy to those patients who are most likely to benefit of such prophylactic treatment in secondary prevention using clinical characteristics or the level of baseline risk appeared not to be useful. A new approach of 'tailored therapy' could be to integrate more patient-specific characteristics, such as the genetic information of patients. Pharmacogenetic research of ACE inhibitors in coronary artery disease patients is at a formative stage, and studies are limited. The Perindopril Genetic association (PERGENE) study is a large pharmacogenetic substudy of the randomized placebo-controlled European trial On Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) trial, aimed to assess the feasibility of pharmacogenetic profiling of ACE-inhibitor therapy by perindopril.

AKI after transplantation can increase treatment-related mortality. To better define these risks, we analyzed 91 patients with SSc who were enrolled in 3 clinical trials in the United States of autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Eleven (12%) of the 91 patients with SSc in these studies (8 undergoing autologous HCT, 1 undergoing allogeneic HCT, 1 pretransplantation, 1 given i.v. cyclophosphamide on a transplantation trial) experienced AKI, of whom 8 required dialysis and/or therapeutic plasma exchange. AKI injury in the 9 HCT recipients developed a median of 35 days (range, 0-90 days) after transplantation. Ten of 11 patients with AKI received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy. The etiology of AKI was attributed to scleroderma renal crisis in 6 patients (including 2 with normotensive renal crisis), to AKI of uncertain etiology in 2 patients, and to AKI superimposed on scleroderma kidney disease in 3 patients. Eight of the 11 patients died, one each because of progression of SSc, multiorgan failure, gastrointestinal and pulmonary bleeding, pericardial tamponade and pulmonary complications, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, graft-versus-host disease, and malignancy.

Associations were similar for fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular or coronary heart disease events. Adjustment for both modifiable and non-modifiable cardiac risk factors (including age, gender, diabetes, blood pressure, smoking, weight, alcohol use, and levels of education) had minimal effect on the strength of the association. Little evidence of bias was found as an explanation for this relationship.",

    "772": "The disorders of orgasm/ejaculation encompass a heterogeneous group of dysfunctions including premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, and perceived ejaculate volume reduction (PEVR). The aim of this study was to explore specific associations of PEVR in a consecutive series of 3141 patients (mean age, 51.6 \u00b1 13.1 years) seeking consultation for erectile dysfunction (ED). Among these, 71 were excluded because they underwent prostate surgery. Different clinical and biochemical factors were evaluated along with parameters derived from the Structured Interview on Erectile Dysfunction evaluating the contribution of organic, relational, and intrapsychic factors to ED. After adjustment for confounders, PEVR was specifically associated with the use of androgen deprivation therapy as well as with different other medications including \u03b1-blockers, serotonergic reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers. A higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and hypogonadism was observed in patients with PEVR compared with the rest of the sample (23.0% vs 14.1% and 9.1% vs 5.3% respectively; both P < .05). In addition, different sexual parameters such as severe ED (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.25 [1.11-1.41]; P < .0001) and patient's (HR = 1.53 [1.38-1.70]; P < .0001) and partner's (HR = 1.21 [1.07-1.36]; P < .005) hypoactive sexual desire (HSD) were also significantly related to PEVR. Furthermore, PEVR was associated with an impairment of both the relational and intrapsychic components of ED. In a multivariate model, adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking habits, and medications, hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, severe ED, and patient's and partner's HSD were all independently associated with PEVR. Our results indicate that PEVR is important not only for couple reproductive purposes but also appears to have a distinct role in the couple's sexual performance.",

While the role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with post-myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction or chronic heart failure is well established, the role for these modalities in patients with stable ischemic heart disease or ischemic heart disease risk equivalents and preserved left ventricular systolic function is not as clear. The aim of this report is to acquire, assess, and summarize the current evidence about the benefits and harms associated with the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, either alone or in combination, in this patient population. The information is intended to inform clinicians, payors, and the public, while helping to define avenues for future research.", 
    "774": "The velocity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression is only partly dependent on the nature and activity of the underlying disease process. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a crucial, and often universal, event responsible for the pathophysiologic mechanisms that accelerate CKD progression. Thus, it would appear that interruption of the RAAS through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or direct renin inhibitors can play a principal role in slowing CKD progression, regardless of the cause. Unfortunately, applying this generalized approach to all forms of CKD has been delayed by the lack of strong, evidence-based data. The aim of this review is to provide the most current evidence available for the use of RAAS blockade as a method of slowing the progression of the various forms of CKD.", 
    "775": "The principal means for reducing proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease are strong blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and strict regulation of blood pressure (BP). This study compared the efficacy of the maximum permissible doses of two common angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), namely valsartan (maximum dose=160\u2009mg per day) and olmesartan (maximum dose=40\u2009mg per day). We also investigated whether a high-dose ARB or the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a high-dose ARB would be more renal protective. We recruited 87 poorly controlled hypertensive patients. In the first study, 50 patients without proteinuria were switched from valsartan (160\u2009mg per day) to olmesartan (40\u2009mg per day) for 4 months. In the second study, 37 patients with proteinuria were randomized to either switch from valsartan 160\u2009mg per day to 40\u2009mg per day olmesartan (n=19; Olm-G) or addition of 2.5-10\u2009mg per day imidapril (stepped up by 2.5\u2009mg per month) to valsartan at 160\u2009mg per day (n=18; Imi-G). After 4 months, the BP level decreased (first study) from 157/88\u2009mm\u2009Hg to 145/82\u2009mm\u2009Hg (P<0.001) and (second study) from 149/86\u2009mm\u2009Hg to 135/77\u2009mm\u2009Hg and 145/82\u2009mm\u2009Hg for Olm-G and Imi-G, respectively. Furthermore, in the second study, urinary protein/creatinine excretion was reduced from 2.0\u00b11.8\u2009g\u2009g\u207b\u00b9 to 0.8\u00b10.8\u2009g\u2009g\u207b\u00b9 (P=0.0242) in Olm-G and from 1.4\u00b11.3\u2009g\u2009g\u207b\u00b9 to 0.9\u00b11.0\u2009g\u2009g\u207b\u00b9 (P=0.0398) in Imi-G. The significance persisted after adjustment for BP or other risk factors. Our results suggested that the maximum dose of olmesartan was more effective than that of valsartan and comparable with the combination of valsartan and imidapril for reducing BP and proteinuria in poorly controlled hypertensive patients.", 
    "776": "To clarify the role of endogenous angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its cleavage product, Ang 1-7, in the atherogenic stimulation of vascular cells, we investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of ACE2 and Mas, an Ang 1-7 receptor, on cellular responses against Ang II stimulation. We measured extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation by western blot, smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation by WST assay and the adhesion of monocytes labeled with PKH67 to endothelial cells (ECs) by fluorescence microplate reader. Cells were pretreated with Ang 1-7, olmesartan (Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) blocker), DX600 (ACE2 inhibitor), -Ala7-Ang1-7 (D-Ala; Mas antagonist), or combinations of treatments before the application of Ang II. Treatment with Ang II increased phosphorylated ERK 1/2 of SMC and EC, proliferation of SMC and adhesion of monocyte to EC, which were blocked by olmesartan. Pretreatment with DX600 either did not accelerate or only slightly accelerated these cellular responses. However, when Ang II signaling through AT1 was reduced by olmesartan, the additional treatment with DX600 significantly blunted some of the effect of olmesartan. Similarly, pretreatment with D-Ala reduced the inhibitory effect of olmesartan in response to Ang II stimulation. Endogenous ACE2 in vascular cells may contribute to counteracting the Ang II-mediated cellular response partly by upregulating the Ang 1-7 signaling through Mas.",

This treatment did not significantly reduce blood pressure (BP) during the acute phase, however. We assessed the short-term safety of reducing BP with renin-angiotensin system blockade in hypertensive patients who sustained acute ischemic stroke. Our randomized study compared the effects of 14 days of oral candesartan (4 mg/day), perindopril (4 mg/day), or conventional therapy (topical nitrate only when systolic BP (SBP) was \u2265220 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) was \u2265120 mm Hg) administered to hypertensive patients within 72 hours of the onset of minor ischemic stroke. We assessed neurologic symptoms using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and the modified Rankin Scale within 72 hours of stroke onset before and after drug therapy. A total of 40 patients completed the protocol. Therapy with candesartan and perindopril reduced SBP/DBP values by 23/11 mm Hg (SBP, P<.01; DBP, P=.07) and 14/0 mm Hg (SBP, P=.07), respectively, compared with conventional treatment. Neurologic symptoms worsened in 2 patients who received perindopril, which has no statistical significance, despite the BP reduction in patients given candesartan or perindopril. Our findings indicate that low doses of candesartan or perindopril safely reduce SBP in hypertensive patients with acute ischemic stroke.",

In our study, 91.9% of participants had hypertension, but it was well controlled (131/76 mmHg). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were used by most participants. Less than 15% of participants had history of ischemic heart disease, and 11.5% had history of stroke. Heart failure and arteriosclerosis obliterans were present in 3.9% and 3.6% of patients, respectively.

Periods during which the antihypertensive drug prescriptions for CCB and/or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS-I; including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker) had not been changed for at least 1 year and during which time a diuretic agent had not been prescribed were selected from among the clinical histories of the 32 outpatients. Consequently, 31 periods of 31 patients were analyzed, and mean treatment duration was 2.4 years in this study. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was used to evaluate renal function. To evaluate the influence of CCB and RAAS-I with respect to the decrease of the eGFR, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), including confounding factors [baseline eGFR, mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP)], was used. Only CCB significantly contributed to a reduction in \u2206eGFR in both a univariable ANCOVA and a multivariable ANCOVA. None of the confounding factors, RAAS-I, the baseline eGFR, or blood pressure, contributed to reductions in \u2206eGFR.",

After rehydration, correction of hyperkalaemia and stopping RAAS-inhibition and diuretics, they recovered completely. Many patients using RAAS-inhibitors have impaired renal function. In the case of dehydration due to gastroenteritis or prolonged fever they risk developing acute renal failure. The high risk groups are elderly patients, patients with atherosclerosis or heart failure and those with co-medication of diuretics or NSAIDs. The underlying mechanism is that the normal pathways to protect kidney perfusion in case of hypovolaemia are blocked by the use of RAAS-inhibitors or NSAIDs. In the case of dehydration in patients with chronic kidney disease using RAAS-inhibitors, serum creatinine and potassium levels should be monitored. Temporary discontinuation of RAAS-inhibitors or diuretics is often necessary.",

APs found on the follow-up colonoscopy were evaluated for location, size, number, and advanced features. Patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) those who used lisinopril continuously during the interval between colonoscopies and (2) those who were lisinopril naive. Clinical factors were evaluated for their association with advanced APs in both the groups.",

Univariate analysis showed that patients with lisinopril use had fewer right-side APs (odds ratio=0.68, P<0.001) and fewer total number of APs (P<0.001). Lisinopril users had a 41% reduced incidence of advanced APs compared with the nonusers (odds ratio=0.59, P<0.001). A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that among lisinopril users, patients with advanced APs were on a lower dose of the medication compared with patients without advanced APs (mean dose=17.2 mg vs. 20.1 mg, respectively; P<0.001). Spearman correlation analyses indicated an inverse relationship between lisinopril dosage and number of polyps (P<0.001). There was also an inverse relationship between dosage and size of polyps (P<0.001); higher dosages of lisinopril were significantly associated with smaller size of polyps. The protective effect of lisinopril was significant even when adjusted for age, body mass index, aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and statin use.",

We aimed to estimate the accuracy of blood pressure monitoring for detecting early nonadherence. We conducted a secondary analysis of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), a large randomized trial of blood pressure lowering to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. We compared change in blood pressure 3 months after randomization in people who had discontinued treatment (nonadherent) with those who stayed on treatment (adherent). We also used an indirect method, assessing whether change in blood pressure discriminated between active (adherent) and placebo (nonadherent) groups. Both methods gave similar results. For the 3433 subjects, the mean (SD) of the change in systolic blood pressure was -15.8 mm Hg (SD 18.7 mm Hg) in the adherent group and -4.2 mm Hg (SD 18.1 mm Hg) in the nonadherent group. After recalibration of the mean change in the nonadherent group to 0 mm Hg and in the adherent group to -11.6 mm Hg, the absence of a fall in systolic blood pressure at 3 months had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 80% for detecting nonadherence (50% of nonadherent patients and 20% of adherent patients had a rise in blood pressure). Discriminatory power was modest over the range of cutoffs (area under the receiver-operator curve 0.67). Monitoring blood pressure is poor at detecting nonadherence to blood pressure-lowering treatment. Further research should look at other methods of assessing adherence.",

Adequate blood pressure control represents the mainstay of treatment, to delay deterioration of renal function and prevent cardiovascular complications. Current evidence supports a target blood pressure value of 130/80\u00a0mm\u2009Hg or less (ie, <125/75\u00a0mm\u2009Hg) when proteinuria exceeds 1\u00a0g/L. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers represent the treatment of choice, especially in the presence of proteinuria. More complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been advocated, using a combination of multiple RAAS blocker drugs or supramaximal doses to maximize renal protection. Achieving recommended blood pressure target values usually requires the use of multiple antihypertensive drugs, including diuretics and calcium channel blockers.",

We determined whether sEH inhibition attenuates the progression of CRF in the 5/6-nephrectomy model (5/6-Nx) in mice. 5/6-Nx mice were treated with a placebo, an ACE-inhibitor (Ramipril, 40 mg/kg), the sEH-inhibitor cAUCB or the CYP-inhibitor fenbendazole for 8 weeks. 5/6-Nx induced hypertension, albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulo-interstitial damage and these effects were attenuated by Ramipril. In contrast, cAUCB failed to lower the blood pressure and albuminuria was more severe as compared to placebo. Plasma EET-levels were doubled in 5/6 Nx-mice as compared to sham mice receiving placebo. Renal sEH expression was attenuated in 5/6-Nx mice but cAUCB in these animals still further increased the EET-level. cAUCB also increased 5-HETE and 15-HETE, which derive from peroxidation or lipoxygenases. Similar to cAUCB, CYP450 inhibition increased HETEs and promoted albuminuria. Thus, sEH-inhibition failed to elicit protective effects in the 5/6-Nx model and showed a tendency to aggravate the disease. These effects might be consequence of a shift of arachidonic acid metabolism into the lipoxygenase pathway.",

Dual blockade was more effective in the group of macroalbuminuric as compared to microalbuminuric subjects (P<0.05). Telmisartan produced a significant reduction in SBP (P<0.05). The addition of ramipril produced a further reduction in BP, the total reduction being 10.3 in SBP and 7.2 mmHg in DBP (P<0.001 for both).

The objective of this study was to investigate the possible link between CAN and ACE. The ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism and the amount and activity of ACE were determined in cadaver kidney recipients with CAN (n = 38) or normal renal function (n = 34). The DD genotype was observed significantly more frequently in the CAN group compared with the group with normal renal function. Moreover, the DD genotype was associated with a higher serum ACE concentration and greater serum ACE activity, compared with II genotype homozygotes. The insertion/deletion polymorphism of ACE affects ACE expression and activity in serum, and, therefore, may have an important role in the pathogenesis of CAN. These findings suggest that determination of the ACE genotype may be useful in identifying patients at high risk. In particular, the DD genotype may be considered an indication for ACE inhibitor therapy.",

Currently, intervention studies demonstrating the impact of ARB/CCB combinations on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are lacking. However, evidence from large outcome trials supports the use of ACE inhibitor/CCB combinations for reducing the risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly in high-risk patients. There is also evidence that the benefits of ACE inhibitor/CCB combinations may extend beyond those solely associated with brachial BP lowering, by an additional impact on central BP haemodynamics.",

However, at present we do not have an adjunctive drug therapy to reduce infarct size in the acute phase in patients with myocardial infarction. Recently, the J-WIND trials suggested that an infusion of human atrial natriuretic peptide in the acute phase and oral administration of nicorandil in the chronic phase of infarction result in a better outcome in patients with a myocardial infarction.

She had been treated with quinapril, enalapril, and lisinopril in the past by different primary care physicians without any adverse effects. She did not abuse alcohol and denied any liver-related problems in the past. Her physical examination revealed icterus and right-upper-quadrant abdominal tenderness. Initial laboratory tests revealed elevated liver enzyme values. Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scans of the patient's abdomen suggested hepatocellular disease with mild hepatomegaly and a normal biliary tract. Due to worsening bilirubin and liver enzyme values, lisinopril was stopped. In the absence of a probable cause of the patient's hepatotoxicity, a CT-guided liver biopsy was performed. Histological examination of the liver tissue showed moderate chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates in the portal area, predominantly composed of lymphocytes with mild-to-moderate interface hepatitis.

The anthocyanin content, the ACE inhibitory activity and the reducing power of the fermented black soybean were then examined. It was found that the ACE inhibitory activity of the extracts of bean and viscous material from the fermented black soybeans varied with extraction solvents and starter organism, yet increased as the fermentation period was extended, regardless of starter organism. After 18 h of fermentation, the water extract of bean showed less ACE inhibitory activity than did the respective 80% ethanol extract. While the water extract of viscous material showed a higher ACE inhibitory activity than the respective ethanol extract. With respect to extraction yield, it was found that the ACE inhibitor in the fermented black soybean could be extracted more efficiently with water than 80% ethanol. Fermentation with B. subtilis BCRC 14715 was also found to increase the anthocyanin content of black soybean and the reducing activity of the extracts.

Through its multiple interactions it protects the endothelium, heart, brain and kidney. In addition, the RAAS regulates the vascular response to injury and inflammation. Chronic activation/dysregulation of the RAAS leads to hypertension and perpetuates a cascade of proinflammatory, prothrombotic and atherogenic effects associated with endorgan damage (heart, brain, kidney, endothelium).

Ten-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the study. After 2 months post ovariectomy (OVX), the rats were treated with captopril (1 or 5 mg/kg/day, respectively) for another 2 months. At endpoint, trabecular bone of the fourth lumbar vertebrae (L4) was undecalcified and examined by bone histomorphometry; the fifth lumbar vertebrae (L5) were examined by compression test. Primary osteoblasts were isolated from the calvaria of newborn rats and treated with different concentrations of captopril in a different durations. The content of secreted alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mRNA expression of collagen I in osteoblasts were determined to demonstrate osteoblast bone formation. In aged rats with estrogen deficiency-induced osteopenia, captopril increased the trabecular area (%BV/TV) of L4 up to 33% and improved biomechanical properties by increasing L5 break stress and elastic modulus when compared to those in the OVX group (P < 0.01). Captopril showed dose-dependent effects on promoting the secretion of ALP and increased mRNA expression of collagen I in the cultured rat osteoblasts. In summary, captopril, one of the most widely used ACEIs, has the potential effects of improving lumbar vertebral bone strength in aged OVX rats and promoting osteoblast bone formation in vitro.",

We studied 110 patients (66 years \u00b110, male 68%, hypertension 76%, diabetes mellitus (DM) 40% and dyslipidemia 65%) without regional myocardial ischemia. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stress and rest first-pass perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired with a 1.5-T MR system, and MPR was calculated as the ratio of stress to rest myocardial blood flow (MBF). Average rest MBF in 110 patients was 1.07\u00b10.62\u2009ml\u2009min\u207b\u00b9\u2009g\u207b\u00b9, whereas stress MBF was 3.15\u00b11.93\u2009ml\u2009min\u207b\u00b9\u2009g\u207b\u00b9 and the MPR was 3.33\u00b11.82. Rest MBF correlated significantly with hematocrit, whereas stress MBF showed a strong correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR). MPR was associated with hypertension, age, e-GFR, hematocrit and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). In multiple regression analysis, hypertension (P=0.003, \u03b2=-0.274) showed the strongest correlation with MPR among other risk factors, such as diabetes (P=ns), dyslipidemia (P=ns), e-GFR (P=ns), LVMI (P=0.007, \u03b2=-0.248) and hematocrit (P=ns) after adjusting age and gender.

Although in heart failure, dual RAS blockade had some benefit without reducing mortality, there remains a distinct safety issue with regard to hyperkalemia and elevated creatinine. Neither in ischaemic heart disease nor in left ventricular hypertrophy had dual RAS blockade any benefits when compared with single RAS blockade. Of note, the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an ARB was recently shown to reduce the risk of dementia. All dual RAS blockade may be created equal and the combination of valsartan with aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor will be evaluated in diabetic patients in the prospective, randomized ALTITUDE study.",

Daily treatment of Ang II-infused wild-type mice with recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; 2 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) IP) blunted the hypertrophic response and expression of hypertrophy markers and reduced Ang II-induced superoxide production. Ang II-mediated myocardial fibrosis and expression of procollagen type I alpha 1, procollagen type III alpha 1, transforming growth factor-beta1, and fibronectin were also suppressed by rhACE2. Ang II-induced diastolic dysfunction was inhibited by rhACE2 in association with reduced plasma and myocardial Ang II and increased plasma Ang 1-7 levels. rhACE2 treatment inhibited Ang II-mediated activation of protein kinase C-alpha and protein kinase C-beta1 protein levels and phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated 1/2, Janus kinase 2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathways in wild-type mice. A subpressor dose of Ang II (0.15 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1)) resulted in a milder phenotype that was strikingly attenuated by rhACE2 (2 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) IP). In adult ventricular cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts, Ang II-mediated superoxide generation, collagen production, and extracellular signal-regulated 1/2 signaling were inhibited by rhACE2 in an Ang 1-7-dependent manner.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition also prevents the breakdown of the vasoconstrictor neuropeptide Y and, when angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is inhibited, substance P. This study tested the hypothesis that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition would enhance the blood pressure response to acute ACE inhibition. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome were treated with 0 mg of enalapril (n=9), 5 mg of enalapril (n=8), or 10 mg enalapril (n=7) after treatment with sitagliptin (100 mg/day for 5 days and matching placebo for 5 days) in a randomized, cross-over fashion. Sitagliptin decreased serum dipeptidyl peptidase-IV activity (13.08\u00b11.45 versus 30.28\u00b11.76 nmol/mL/min during placebo; P\u22640.001) and fasting blood glucose. Enalapril decreased ACE activity in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.001). Sitagliptin lowered blood pressure during enalapril (0 mg; P=0.02) and augmented the hypotensive response to 5 mg of enalapril (P=0.05). In contrast, sitagliptin attenuated the hypotensive response to 10 mg of enalapril (P=0.02). During sitagliptin, but not during placebo, 10 mg of enalapril significantly increased heart rate and plasma norepinephrine concentrations. There was no effect of 0 or 5 mg of enalapril on heart rate or norepinephrine after treatment with either sitagliptin or placebo. Sitagliptin enhanced the dose-dependent effect of enalapril on renal blood flow. In summary, sitagliptin lowers blood pressure during placebo or submaximal ACE inhibition; sitagliptin activates the sympathetic nervous system to diminish hypotension when ACE is maximally inhibited. This study provides the first evidence for an interactive hemodynamic effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV and ACE inhibition in humans.",

    "886": "A large body of evidence indicates that endothelial dysfunction is a characteristic of patients with arterial hypertension. As functional abnormalities lead to impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, this early step of atherogenesis is potentially reversible. In addition to reducing blood pressure, the major families of anti-hypertensive drugs have a number of pleiotropic effects that could improve endothelial function. In particular, the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of both arterial hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, and so drugs capable of limiting the dangerous effects of this hormonal axis, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors, could help prevent/delay/reverse the atherosclerotic process. New third-generation \u03b2-blockers and 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors may affect endothelial function. Furthermore, the HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors currently used to reduce cholesterol levels have major pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects. The preservation or recovery of endothelial function in hypertensive patients is crucial to inhibit the development of atherosclerosis and the onset of cardiovascular events. This review focuses on the ancillary effects of hypertensive drugs and HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors that go beyond lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.",

AC3174 plus captopril attenuated the deleterious effects of high salt on posterior wall thickness, LV mass, and the ratio of LV mass to body weight (P < or = 0.05). In contrast, GLP-1 had no effect on these cardiovascular parameters. All treatments reduced LV wall stress.

Although these characteristics suggest the clinical usefulness and safety of aliskiren, several problems remain unsolved. Why does aliskiren have beneficial effects on the heart and kidneys of patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin II type 1-receptor blockers (ARBs)? Is the blood-pressure-lowering effect of aliskiren dependent on the plasma renin activity? Does aliskiren exert a possible adverse effect via (pro)renin receptor-dependent intracellular signals?

It should be noted that the residual event rate in the treatment arm in outcome studies that have employed ACE inhibitors or ARBs remains high. Such insufficient efficacy of RAS inhibition may result from the fact that neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs completely suppress activity of RAS. Since then effort has been made to determine whether the dual blockade of RAS could provide further improvement in cardiovascular and renal outcome.

    "902": "Out of 100 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), almost 40 have a concomitant diagnosis of hypertension. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients with established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls are needed in treated hypertensive patients who are concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors because even a small increase in BP may be associated with an important rise in the risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated with a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. These data have been confirmed in randomized studies with rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in the treatment of patients with OA. Naproxcinod, the first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of the traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to the nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). The molecule has the potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented the BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed with naproxen. The BP benefit of naproxcinod over naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. These investigational data suggest that naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of OA patients.",

Two important considerations are requisite prior to interpreting these results, specifically: the context of the cohort studied (non-proteinuric CKD patients at low risk of progression) and the inadequate power of the study to assess renal outcomes. The cardiac and renal protection afforded from dual RAAS blockade in select populations, particularly proteinuric CKD and CHF, is supported by literature. Moreover, the response to dual RAAS blockade involving different combinations of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors, may not be uniform amongst all patient populations. Will we continue to withhold the appropriate medical therapy from certain individuals based on misconstrued data?

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that COX-2 inhibition causes hemodynamic and excretory effects that are increased in proportion to ANG II activity. In anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats having augmented cortical COX-2 expression but different ANG II activity, we conducted renal clearance experiments during acute inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide (NMSLD) and inhibition of COX-1 with SC-560. In one series of experiments, acute captopril [acute angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (aACEi)] was administered alone (n = 13) or in combination with chronic captopril [chronic ACEi (cACEi)] pretreatment (n = 19). In another series of experiments, rats were fed a normal-sodium [0.4% (NS), n = 12] or a low-sodium [0.03% (LS), n = 18] diet. NMSLD did not alter mean arterial blood pressure in any group but, in the LS and cACEi groups, decreased renal plasma flow (from 3.99 \u00b1 0.33 to 2.85 \u00b1 0.26 and from 4.30 \u00b1 0.19 to 3.22 \u00b1 0.21 ml\u00b7min(-1)\u00b7g(-1)), cortical blood flow (-12 \u00b1 8% and -13 \u00b1 4%), and glomerular filtration rate (from 0.88 \u00b1 0.04 to 0.65 \u00b1 0.05 and from 0.95 \u00b1 0.07 to 0.70 \u00b1 0.05 ml\u00b7min(-1)\u00b7g(-1)). In contrast, medullary blood flow (MBF) was significantly decreased by COX-2 inhibition in NS (-24 \u00b1 5%), LS (-27 \u00b1 8%), aACEi (-16 \u00b1 3.8%), and cACEi (-24 \u00b1 4.2%) groups. Absolute and fractional sodium excretion rates were unchanged by NMSLD, except in the LS group (0.75 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bceq/min and 0.43 \u00b1 0.15% and 0.51 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bceq/min and 0.26 \u00b1 0.10%). SC-560 did not augment the effects of NMSLD. These results demonstrate an augmented COX-2-mediated vasodilation that is not contingent on ANG II, in contrast to COX-2-mediated augmented sodium excretion, where ANG II activity is requisite. Furthermore, the COX-2 effects on MBF are not contingent on ANG II or changes in cortical microvascular responses. These results reflect COX-2 continual regulation of MBF and adaptive opposition to ANG II prohypertensinogenic effects on renal plasma flow, cortical blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and absolute and fractional sodium excretion.", 
    "938": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE; kininase II) levels in humans are genetically determined. ACE levels have been linked to risk of myocardial infarction, but the association has been inconsistent, and the causality underlying it remains undocumented. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in ACE levels influences myocardial tolerance to ischemia. We studied ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice bearing 1 (ACE1c), 2 (ACE2c, wild type), or 3 (ACE3c) functional copies of the ACE gene and displaying an ACE level range similar to humans. Infarct size in ACE1c was 29% lower than in ACE2c (P<0.05). Pretreatment with a kinin B2 receptor antagonist suppressed this reduction. In ACE3c, infarct size was the same as in ACE2c. But ischemic preconditioning, which reduced infarct size in ACE2c (-63%, P<0.001) and ACE1c (-52%, P<0.05), was not efficient in ACE3c (-2%, NS, P<0.01 vs. ACE2c). In ACE3c, ischemic preconditioning did not decrease myocardial inflammation or cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Pretreatment with a renin inhibitor had no cardioprotective effect in ACE2c, but in ACE3c partially restored (38%) the cardioprotection of ischemic preconditioning. Thus, a modest genetic increase in ACE impairs myocardial tolerance to ischemia. ACE level plays a critical role in cardiac ischemia, through both kinin and angiotensin mediated mechanisms.",

It shows promise in advanced proteinuric nephropathy for additional proteinuria reduction. Whether this additional proteinuria reduction translates into meaningful outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown, as proteinuria change is not a validated surrogate end point. Until we know the answer to this question, only those with very high levels of proteinuria should receive combination RAAS blocking therapy, and they need to be carefully monitored. Such individuals should be evaluated for risk of hyperkalemia and should consider use of a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist added to the single RAAS agent as an alternative for proteinuria reduction. This provides a safe and effective option for those patients with advanced nephropathic disease who need additional proteinuria reduction. In all cases other than advanced proteinuric nephropathy, there is no evidence of any positive CKD outcome with dual RAAS blockade.

This article reviews our current understanding of the ocular-specific effects of systemic medications commonly used by patients with diabetes mellitus, including those directed at control of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiac disease, anemia, inflammation and cancer. Current clinical evidence is strongest for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers in preventing the onset or slowing the progression of early diabetic retinopathy. To a more limited extent, evidence of a benefit of fibrates for diabetic macular edema exists. Numerous other agents hold considerable promise or potential risk.

Clinical significance of drug interactions varies. * Studies which only identified drug interactions of potentially major clinical significance found lower prevalence, of between 2 and 16%. * Prevalence of drug interactions defined 'potentially hazardous' has had limited study, with no publications identified for the Australian population. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS * In the study population of 287 074, 1.5% of subjects were dispensed potentially hazardous interacting drug pairs. * However, limited to populations on specific medicines, it was found that for patients dispensed verapamil, methotrexate, amiodarone, lithium, warfarin, cyclosporin and itraconazole, potentially hazardous interactions occurred at a rate greater than 5%. * These patients should be the focus of medication review programmes to avoid potentially serious adverse drug events. BACKGROUND Up to 21% of adverse drug event-related hospital admissions are due to drug interactions. Clinical significance of drug interactions varies, and drug interactions defined 'potentially hazardous' are more likely to contribute to morbidity and mortality. AIM The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of potentially hazardous drug interactions in an elderly Australian veteran population. METHODS This study assessed the prevalence of potentially hazardous drug interactions, where hazardous was defined in three or more international drug interaction references, using Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme pharmacy claims data. Analysis was limited to patients who received regular concurrent dispensings of potentially hazardous interacting medicines. RESULTS Of the 287 074 subjects included in the study, 1.5% were dispensed potentially hazardous interacting drug pairs. For patients dispensed cyclosporin, concomitant use of a statin was common (47%); as was statin use with those dispensed itraconazole (31%). Of those dispensed methotrexate, 24% also received a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; of those on lithium, 18% also received an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin 2 receptor blocker; of those on warfarin, 7.2% and 5.9% were co-dispensed an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antiplatelets respectively; for those on verapamil, 5.3% were co-dispensed a beta-blocker, while for those on amiodarone 6.2% were co-dispensed digoxin. CONCLUSIONS Overall prevalence of potentially serious drug interactions appears to be low in the Australian veteran population. However, patients taking cyclosporine, itraconazole, methotrexate, lithium, warfarin, verapamil and amiodarone appear to be most at risk and their medicine use should be regularly reviewed to prevent potentially hazardous drug interactions.", 
    "971": "Several drugs have been shown to produce an adverse affect on kidneys, mainly when exposure occurred during active nephrogenesis (pregnancy or prematurity). Several experimental studies on drug-related renal injury have been done on animal models. Observational reports on early drug-related nephrotoxicity in humans are increasing. The investigations regard nephrotoxicity from antibiotics (particularly aminoglycosides), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antifungins. Few reports have been specifically on the long-term effects on kidneys of drugs given to newborns during active nephrogenesis. Most observations were targeted to investigate long-term renal effects of prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Nephrotoxic medication taken during fetal life and during postnatal nephrogenesis could interfere with nephron generation contributing to a particular magnitude of damage. Such adjunctive damage could further increase the risk of renal failure in the adulthood of children born prematurely.", 
    "972": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) or the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a major endocrine/paracrine system that regulates blood pressure (BP) via angiotensin release and fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis via aldosterone release. RAAS should be constantly suppressed and any degree of activity may lead to hypertension (HTN) and associated target organ damage. Activation of the RAAS in the pathogenesis of HTN, CVD and renal disease is well documented. Also benefits of inhibition of RAAS, as an effective way to intervene in pathogenesis HTN, CVD and CRF, has been well recognized. RAAS may be blocked by drugs at various points and is important target site for five distinctive classes of hypertensive drugs; beta blockers, renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone inhibitors. Inhibition of renin activity and the blocked of RAAS cascade at its primary steps, has long been proposed as the optimal means of RAAS Inhibition. Renin inhibitor provides more effective means of RAAS Inhibition. Aliskiren is the first in a new class of orally active, non-peptide, low molecular weight direct renin inhibitor (DRI) available for clinical use and potential new approach to the blockade of the RAAS. An average plasma half-life of 23.7 hours (range 20-45 hours), makes drug suitable for once daily administration. BP-lowering affect of aliskiren is associated with a decreased, not increased, generation of Ang I, as it blocks generation of Ang I from angiotensinogen, by inhibiting the active enzymatic site of renin. Aliskiren has generally been well tolerated with adverse events and discontinuation rates similar to placebo in most clinical trials. Aliskiren has the potential to be useful in this wide spectrum of conditions and may provide organ protection independent of BP reductions.", 
    "973": "National guidelines recommend angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensinogen receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), including those with symptomatic heart failure (HF). However, guideline adherence has not been optimal. The goal of this quality improvement project is to devise and implement a sustainable care-delivery model in a 920-bed academic hospital center that would improve ACEi/ARB adherence before hospital discharge.", 
    "974": "The Model of intervention is: (1) a computer-based daily screening program; (2) inpatient pharmacist e-flag message; and (3) alerts for inpatient care teams. Its operating algorithm: If eligible adult HF/LVSD inpatients are not on ACEi or ARB nor documentation of contraindications, a flag alert is generated; deficiency is confirmed by a pharmacist and conveyed to the patient-care teams; if alert is acted on and care brought into adherence, the screening program would not re-flag the same patients the succeeding day; if not, the patients would be re-flagged daily until reaching adherence. We compared ACEi/ARB adherence before, during, and after the intervention.", 
    "975": "Baseline performance (percentage of eligible HF/LVSD patients receiving ACEi/ARB) was 87.5%. After implementation of the Model the ACEi/ARB adherence rate at the time of hospital discharge rose to 96.7% (P < 0.002) and was sustained for 21 months without needing additional personnel.",

    "977": "It has been shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) is involved in cardiac remodeling mediated by NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accordingly, NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS may play a role in cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. In the present study, we sought to determine whether inhibition of NADPH oxidase prevents cardiac hypertrophy. After abdominal aorta banding to induce cardiac hypertrophy, rats were treated for 8 weeks with apocynin (Apo) or captopril (Cap). Measures of cardiac hypertrophy were evaluated. Treatment with Cap or Apo reduced the left ventricle/body weight ratio (LV/BW), LV transnuclear myocyte diameter, and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) mRNA expression relative to those of untreated rats subjected to aorta banding. The activity of NADPH oxidase and the ROS levels were decreased in treated animals. Cap, but not Apo, decreased Ang II levels and inhibited expression of p22phox and p67phox in LVs. In conclusion, local expression of Ang II appears to contribute to pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by upregulating NADPH oxidase expression and promoting ROS synthesis. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase and elimination of ROS may prevent or repair damage due to cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "978": "Bleomycin has potent anti-oncogenic properties for several neoplasms, but drug administration is limited by bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system has been suggested to decrease bleomycin toxicity, but the efficacy of such strategies remains uncertain and somewhat contradictory. Our hypothesis is that, besides angiotensin II, other substrates of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), such as the tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), play a significant role in controlling fibrosis. We studied bleomycin-induced lung injury in normotensive mice, termed N-KO and C-KO, which have point mutations inactivating either the N- or C-terminal catalytic sites of ACE, respectively. N-KO, but not C-KO mice, have a marked resistance to bleomycin lung injury as assessed by lung histology and hydroxyproline content. To determine the importance of the ACE N-terminal peptide substrate AcSDKP in the resistance to bleomycin injury, N-KO mice were treated with S-17092, a prolyl-oligopeptidase inhibitor that inhibits the formation of AcSDKP. In response to bleomycin injection, S-17092-treated N-KO mice developed lung fibrosis similar to wild-type mice. In contrast, the administration of AcSDKP to wild-type mice reduced lung fibrosis due to bleomycin administration. This study shows that the inactivation of the N-terminal catalytic site of ACE significantly reduced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and implicates AcSDKP in the mechanism of protection. These data suggest a possible means to increase tolerance to bleomycin and to treat fibrosing lung diseases.", 
    "979": "The transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily are of structurally related proteins that mediate developmental processes including cell growth, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis, tissue differentiation, morphogenesis, proliferation, and migration. Smads are intracellular signaling effectors that mediate intracellular signaling of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily. They have been implicated in a wide range of cardiac disorders, including cardiac failure, cardiac fibrosis, myocardial infarction, injury induced by angioplasty, and pulmonary artery hypertension. They also have a function to regulate cardiac structural development in embryos. By binding to types I and II of serine-threonine kinase receptors, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) enables phosphorylation of Smad1 to form hetero-oligomeric complexes with Smad4, and modulate the transcription of the target genes after they are translocated into the nucleus. Appropriate interventions, such as Smad-responsive transcriptional promoter and antifibrotic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, can be helpful in reversing cardiac abnormalities. The aim of this article is to describe the current research results of Smad proteins in terms of cardiac disorders and development through transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 pathways.",

Triple therapy with carvedilol, ramipril and spironolactone was continued to prevent further LV remodeling. During 3-years follow-up repeated echocardiographic examinations revealed gradual improvement of LV function and clinical condition of the patient. Results of current studies suggest benefits of early implementation of aldosterone antagonist therapy in addition to ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin receptors blockers and beta-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "981": "The ability of captopril and losartan treatment to restore cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation after intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (HS) was assessed in Kyoto-Wistar stroke-prone hypertensive rats (SHRsp). Laser Doppler techniques assessed CBF autoregulation in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) perfusion domain and a pressure myograph was used to measure pressure-dependent constriction (PDC) in isolated MCAs before and after stroke and after 13, 33, and 63 days of poststroke captopril or losartan treatment. The treatments did not lower blood pressure (BP) and equally suppressed plasma aldosterone after HS. The HS development was associated with the loss of CBF autoregulation, high CBF, increased CBF conductance to elevations in BP, and the loss of PDC in the MCAs. Both treatments restored these functions to prestroke levels within 13 days. The PDC and CBF autoregulation subsequently deteriorated after 63 days of captopril treatment while being maintained at prestroke levels over all durations of losartan treatment. The SHRsp subjected to 35 days of poststroke losartan treatment exhibited less blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and brain herniation than captopril-treated SHRsp. The superior ability of losartan to restore CBF autoregulation and myogenic function may have contributed to the more effective attenuation of cerebral damage after HS.",

In the first phase treatment was optimized at standard doses.

    "986": "The aim of this article is to briefly review available data regarding changes in the structure of microvessels observed in patients with diabetes mellitus, and possible correction by effective treatment. The development of structural changes in the systemic vasculature is the end result of established hypertension. In essential hypertension, small arteries of smooth muscle cells are restructured around a smaller lumen and there is no net growth of the vascular wall, although in some secondary forms of hypertension, a hypertrophic remodelling may be detected. Moreover, in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus a hypertrophic remodelling of subcutaneous small arteries is present. Indices of small resistance artery structure, such as the tunica media to internal lumen ratio, may have a strong prognostic significance in hypertensive and diabetic patients, over and above all other known cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, regression of vascular alterations is an appealing goal of antihypertensive treatment. Different antihypertensive drugs seem to have different effect on vascular structure. In diabetic hypertensive patients, a significant regression of structural alterations of small resistance arteries with drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers) was demonstrated. Alterations in the microcirculation represent a common pathological finding, and microangiopathy is one of the most important mechanisms involved in the development of organ damage as well as of clinical events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Renin-angiotensin system blockade seems to be effective in preventing/regressing alterations in microvascular structure.",

    "991": "The renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) plays a very important role in the regulation of blood pressure in humans (1-4). Renin is an enzyme produced in the kidneys, and it cleaves circulating angiotensinogen (a protein produced in the liver) to yield angiotensin I, an inactive decapeptide. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), found primarily in the lung, converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, an active vasoconstrictor octapeptide. Angiotensin II also stimulates the production of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, which promotes retention of sodium and water. ACE is also responsible for inactivating bradykinin, a vasodilator (5). RAS and angiotensin II also play a role in interstitial fibrosis, cardiac remodeling and fibrosis, and heart failure (6, 7). It has been shown that RAS operates in the heart, and an upregulation of this system is correlated to heart failure (8-10). Inhibition of ACE in patients with heart failure has often resulted in a favorable outcome for the patient (11), although individuals treated with ACE inhibitors have been reported to respond differently as a result of genetic variations in the enzyme; a meta-analysis of data obtained from children of different races who had been treated with these inhibitors has shown the children reacted differently to the treatment (12, 13). In addition, the proper timing, optimal dosing, and monitoring of ACE inhibitor therapy for the individualized treatment of patients has not been fully worked out. Also, ACE appears to have a role in several other pathological conditions including myeloid leukemia, atherosclerosis, and diabetes (in the kidneys of patients) because an increased level of either the protein or its mRNA has been reported under these conditions (14-16). In a preliminary radioautographic study, Dilsizian et al. showed that ACE expression correlated with the extent of the disease in patients with congestive heart failure and suggested that monitoring ACE expression may help monitor molecular remodeling of the heart (3). On the basis of this observation, Femia et al. envisioned that a radiotracer designed for imaging the RAS would be helpful for the development of individualized ACE inhibitor therapy (17). In this regard, a compound with high affinity for ACE, such as lisinopril or its derivative, would be best suited to study the expression of a radiotracer. Several derivatives of lisinopril that can incorporate rhodium or palladium while maintaining high affinity for ACE were reported and could probably be used to synthesize radiolabeled analogs of the compound (18). Using a single amino acid chelator technology based on the di(pyridylmethyl)amine chelator, Femia et al. synthesized a technetium-carbonyl (Tc(CO)3) core derivative of lisinopril and evaluated for the in vivo imaging of ACE expression in rats (17).",
