    "1": "A literature review identified existing quality indicators for AMI care. A list of potential indicators was assessed by a nine-member panel of clinicians from a variety of disciplines using a modified-Delphi panel process. After an initial round of rating the potential indicators, a series of indicators was identified for a second round of discussion at a national meeting. Further refinement of indicators occurred following a teleconference and review by external reviewers.", 
    "2": "To identify an AMI cohort, case definition criteria were developed, using a hospital discharge diagnosis for AMI of International Classification of Diseases-Ninth revision (ICD-9) code 410.x. Thirty-seven indicators for AMI care were established. Pharmacological process of care indicators included administration of acetylsalicylic acid, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thrombolytics and statins. Mortality and readmissions for AMI, unstable angina and congestive heart failure were recommended as outcome indicators. Nonpharmacological indicators included median length of stay in the emergency department, and median waiting times for cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention and/or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.",

    "5": "Hospitalized patients were screened to identify individuals with CHF, age more than 65 years, New York Heart Association classification III to IV, and no contraindications to ACE inhibitor treatment. One hundred forty-five patients were randomized to a nurse-monitored structured care program that included uptitration of enalapril to a target dose of 10 mg twice a day or to standard care. Six-month follow-up data were collected.", 
    "6": "The mean age of the randomized patients was 81 years. Although the proportion of patients treated with an ACE inhibitor did not differ between structured care (70%) and standard care (64%), the number of patients with the target ACE inhibitor dose was significantly higher in the structured care group (26% versus 11% in the standard care group; P <.018). Treatment had to be discontinued in 26% of the patients because of adverse effects.", 
    "7": "The patients in this study were older than in previous intervention studies and had considerable comorbidity and reduced tolerance for ACE inhibitors.

More cardiologists' patients received an EF assessment (94% vs. 74%, p < 0.001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (83% vs. 68%, p < 0.001), and beta-blockers (38% vs. 22%, p < 0.001). In multivariate proportional hazards modeling that included variables that differed between providers and univariate predictors of outcomes, cardiology care was an independent predictor of a lower risk for the combined outcome (hazard ratio 0.62, confidence interval 0.42 to 0.93, p = 0.02).",

For CAD in NDTI, beta-blocker use increased slowly from 19% in 1990, to 20% in 1995, then to 40% in 2001; NAMCS showed this same pattern. Aspirin use in CAD in NDTI increased from 18% in 1990, to 19% in 1995, to 38% in 2001; NAMCS, however, showed lower use rates. For NDTI, ACEI use in CHF increased from 24% in 1990 to 36% in 1996, but increased to only 39% by 2001, a general pattern also seen in NAMCS.",

    "18": "Aprotinin is an important member of a family of related protease inhibitors and has many clinically beneficial activities. These inhibitors have multiple functions, but not all of them are mediated by enzyme inhibition. Aprotinin has complex effects on many homeostatic functions including coagulation, platelet function and inflammation. It also has complex interactions with other drug therapies including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Since patients with cardiovascular diseases are treated frequently with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and also often need cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and receive aprotinin, these interactions are potentially significant but often overlooked. Aprotinin is currently used to reduce the amount of transfused homologous blood (during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery) and thus, the risks associated with homologous blood transfusion. Aprotinin also has potential uses in acute pancreatitis, carcinoid tumors, sepsis, and other clinical situations. Future research will provide a definitive answer for the need to employ this inhibitor therapeutically in these situations. Aprotinin also has some potentially adverse effects in the kidney in special circumstances. For example, the use of aprotinin in diabetic patients may be related with an increased risk for renal dysfunction. It has also been associated with thrombosis, inadequate coagulation, and allergic reactions. In balance, the available information indicates that the advantages of its application outweigh its disadvantages in most patients.", 
    "19": "This review summarizes physiology of circulating and local renin-angiotensin system (RAS), enzymatic properties and mechanism of action of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on RAS, and implications of ACEIs in anesthetic management of patients treated with these drugs. ACEIs, through their effect on RAS, may improve cardiovascular functions, pulmonary dynamics, and body fluid homeostasis. Thus, ACEIs have become an integral part of management of patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic renal disease. ACEIs, due to differences in their chemical structure, exert different pharmacological actions and can have protective or occasional damaging effects on different organs. The anesthesiologists are commonly involved in the management of patients treated with ACEIs. Thus, the role of ACEIs and their possible interaction with anesthetic agents must be an integral part of clinical decision-making during anesthesia Hemodynamic variation during anesthesia is mainly related to specific effects of anesthetic agents on sympathetic nervous system. Those with preoperative fasting, volume depletion and extended sympathetic blockade can have reduced vascular capacitance resulting in decreased venous return, reduced cardiac output and severe arterial hypotension. Angiotensin II (ANG2) a potent vasoconstrictor may counterbalance such hypotensive effect. During ACE inhibition ANG2 cannot counterbalance this hypotension. Thus, induction of anesthesia may cause severe hypotension in hypovolemic patients specifically in those receiving diuretics as a complement to ACEIs. Recent advances in RAS and the pharmacology of ACEIs have identified some predisposing factors and risks associated with anesthesia in patients treated with ACEIs. Practitioners should be vigilant, and readily have vasopressors, necessary fluids and other resuscitative measures for treatment of unexpected hemodynamic instability during anesthesia and surgery.", 
    "20": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AII) type 1 receptor antagonists have strong cytostatic properties on in vitro cultures of many normal and neoplastic cells. They are effective, in particular, in reducing the growth of human lung fibroblasts, renal canine epithelial cells, bovine adrenal endothelial cells, simian T lymphocytes, and of neoplastic cell lines derived from human neuroblastomas, a ductal pancreatic carcinoma of the Syrian hamsters, human salivary glands adenocarcinomas, and two lines of human breast adenocarcinomas. ACE inhibitors are also effective in protecting lungs, kidneys and bladders from the development of nephropathy, pneumopathy, cystitis, and eventually fibrosis in different models of organ-induced damage such as exposure to radiation, chronic hypoxia, administration of the alkaloid monocrotaline or bladder ligation. ACE inhibitors and AII type 1 receptor antagonists are also effective in reducing excessive vascular neoformation in a model of injury to the cornea of rats and rabbits, and in controlling the excessive angiogenesis observed in the Solt-Farber model of experimentally induced hepatoma, in methylcholantrene or radiation-induced fibrosarcomas, in radiation-induced squamous cell carcinomas and in the MA-16 viral-induced mammary carcinoma of the mouse. Captopril was, in addition, effective in controlling tumor growth in a case of Kaposi's sarcoma in humans. The inhibition of AII synthesis and/or its blockade by AII receptors is likely to be an important mechanism for this cytostatic action. The mitogenic effect of AII is well established and a reduction of AII synthesis may well explain cell and neoplasm delayed growth. Moreover, AII regulates and enhances the activity of several growth factors including transforming growth factor B (TGFB) and smooth muscle actin (SMA); and many of these factors are reduced in tissues of animals treated with ACE inhibitors and AII type 1 receptor antagonists. These processes seem to be particularly relevant in the control of fibroblast growth and in the control of the ensuing fibrosis. The ACE inhibitors containing a sulphydril (SH) or thiol radical in their moiety (Captopril and CL242817) seemed to be more effective in controlling fibrosis and the growth of some neoplastic cells than those ACE inhibitors without this thiol radical in their structure, even if the second group of these drugs show in vitro a stronger inhibitory effect on converting enzyme activity. Pharmacologically it is known that ACE inhibitors containing a thiol radical also have antioxidant properties and they are efficient in controlling metalloproteinase action. However, although these additional properties are pharmacologically relevant, the blockade of AII synthesis plays an essential role in the cytostatic activity of these two categories of drugs. These observations underline that in addition to the beneficial effect of these drugs on the cardiovascular system, new potential applications are opening for their wider deployment.", 
    "21": "Radiation nephropathy has emerged as a major complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) when total body irradiation (TBI) is used as part of the regimen. Classically, radiation nephropathy has been assumed to be inevitable, progressive, and untreatable. However, in the early 1990's, it was demonstrated that experimental radiation nephropathy could be treated with a thiol-containing ACE inhibitor, captopril. Further studies showed that enalapril (a non-thiol ACE inhibitor) was also effective in the treatment of experimental radiation nephropathy, as was an AII receptor antagonist. Studies also showed that ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists were effective in the prophylaxis of radiation nephropathy. Interestingly, other types of antihypertensive drugs were ineffective in prophylaxis, but brief use of a high-salt diet in the immediate post-irradiation period decreased renal injury. A placebo-controlled trial of captopril to prevent BMT nephropathy in adults is now underway. Since excess activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) causes hypertension, and hypertension is a major feature of radiation nephropathy; an explanation for the efficacy of RAS antagonism in the prophylaxis of radiation nephropathy would be that radiation leads to RAS activation. However, current studies favor an alternative explanation, namely that the normal activity of the RAS is deleterious in the presence of radiation injury. On-going studies suggest that efficacy of RAS antagonists may involve interactions with a radiation-induced decrease in renal nitric oxide activity or with radiation-induced tubular cell proliferation. We hypothesize that while prevention (prophylaxis) of radiation nephropathy with ACE inhibitors, AII receptor antagonists, or a high-salt diet work by suppression of the RAS, the efficacy of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists in treatment of established radiation nephropathy depends on blood pressure control.", 
    "22": "Myocarditis is a disease whose pathogenesis is not completely understood and whose prevalence is likely underestimated. Individuals afflicted with this condition may be treated with agents that relieve symptoms arising from inflammation and concurrent cellular damage. One class of drugs commonly used in the treatment of myocarditis includes the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, such as captopril, enalapril and lisinopril, and the angiotensin Pi receptor antagonists, such as L-158,809 and losartan. The effects of these drugs on cardiomyopathy have been studied using a variety of animal models of heart failure and hypertension. However, less research has been done in the area of animal models of frank myocarditis. Here we review the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin Pi receptor antagonists in animal models of myocarditis. We extend the implications of that published work by correlation with results from studies of other disease models and in vitro experiments that highlight the immunomodulatory potential of these compounds. The literature strongly suggests that aggressive therapy employing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and/or blockade of angiotensin Pi receptors is beneficial. Treatment is useful not only for reducing complications associated with myocarditis, but also for downregulating the potential autoimmune component of disease without increasing the levels of the infectious agent that may initiate the myocarditis.", 
    "23": "The circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has a well-described role in circulatory homeostasis. Recently, local tissue-based RAS have also been described which appear to play a key role in the injury/repair response. The expression of RAS components and the elevation of angiotensin converting enzyme in a number of interstitial lung diseases suggests the existence of a pulmonary RAS and that angiotensin II could mediate, at least in part, the response to lung injury. Activation of a local RAS within the pulmonary circulation and lung parenchyma could influence the pathogenesis of lung injury via a number of mechanisms including an increase in vascular permeability, vascular tone and fibroblast activity, and by reducing alveolar epithelial cell survival. The ability of both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists to attenuate experimental lung injury further supports a role for RAS activation and suggests these agents may be useful in the treatment of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. However, further studies are required to delineate the cell types responsible for RAS component expression in the lung and also to identify the key effector molecules of this system. The presence of common polymorphisms in RAS genes and their study in relation to specific physiological phenotypes will aid both our understanding of the role of RAS in the lung and also aid the targeting of future therapies.", 
    "24": "Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-Is) and angiotensin (ANG) receptor antagonists were originally developed to aid in the management of hypertension. As the use of these agents was extended to the management of heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases, studies of tissue remodeling suggested that blockade of ANGII function might play a role in the regulation of cell death by apoptosis. Experiments with cultured cells confirmed that ANGII is an inducer of apoptosis in well differentiated cell types isolated from the heart, kidneys, lungs and other organs. More recent evidence with animal models strongly suggests that ACE-Is and ANG receptor antagonists, in addition to affecting hemodynamics, also influence disease progression through direct inhibition of ANG-induced apoptosis. This manuscript reviews the evidence supporting this view, discusses its potential relevance to disease pathogenesis and offers new hypotheses regarding novel uses of ACE-Is and ANG receptor antagonists in the control of cell death.", 
    "25": "This review summarizes some basic properties and distribution of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is one of several biologically important ectoproteins that exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. Localized on the surface of various cells, ACE is inserted at the cell membrane via its carboxyl terminus. Human plasma ACE originates from endothelial cells while other body fluids may contain ACE that originates from epithelial, endothelial or germinal cells. The two isoforms of ACE, the two-domain somatic form and the single domain germinal form, convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and metabolize kinins and many other biologically active peptides, including substance P, chemotactic peptide and opioid peptides. The broad spectrum of substrates for ACE and its wide distribution throughout the body indicates that this enzyme, in addition to an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis, may be involved in additional physiologic processes such as neovascularization, fertilization, atherosclerosis, kidney and lung fibrosis, myocardial hypertrophy, inflammation and wound healing. Future research should explore the possible functions of tissue ACE and its systemic role as a pressor agent. ACE inhibitors have achieved widespread use in the treatment of hypertension and the protection of end-organ damage in cardiovascular and renal diseases. Potential problems related to side effects and compliance of such therapy need to be addressed. A safer way of producing therapeutic effects is promised by the delivery of the ACE antisense sequences by a vector producing a permanent inhibition of ACE and long-term control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients.", 
    "26": "Albumin excretion is modulated post-filtration by lysosomal processing that produces a spectrum of albumin-derived material in urine, much of which is not detected by conventional immunoassays.

This was accompanied by a significant decrease in blood pressure (P < 0.001 for SHR-c + RAM and SHR-d + RAM), renal beta ig-h3 mRNA production (P < 0.05 for SHR-c + RAM and SHR-d + RAM), and an increase in lysosomal activity. Diabetes (WKY-d and SHR-d) primarily caused a significant increase in total albumin excretion, predominantly in the form of albumin-derived fragments in the WKY-d group and intact albumin in the SHR-d group. Ramipril treatment reduced total albumin excretion in the WKY-d + RAM group (P < 0.001).",

Blood pressure, plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone, total kallikrein and urinary kallikrein-like activity were measured after each period. Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were also measured. In essential hypertensive subjects, renal hemodynamic and hormonal parameters were also measured after 3 days of 20 mg enalapril administration.", 
    "32": "Plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone were higher in normotensives, essential hypertensives and offspring of hypertensive parents only during low sodium intake, whereas urinary kallikrein activity was lower in hypertensive offspring and essential hypertensives, compared with normotensives, during the three diet conditions. Effective renal plasma flow was found to be reduced in hypertensives and normotensive offspring, while the glomerular filtration rated was similar in the three groups. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) administration to essential hypertensives for 3 days normalized effective renal plasma flow, increased plasma renin activity and decreased aldosterone and urinary kallikrein activity.", 
    "33": "Our observations confirmed the presence of a hormonal imbalance between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the kallikrein-kinin system, not only in essential hypertensives but also in the offspring of hypertensive parents. This imbalance probably affects the renal circulation and sodium homeostasis, since there was reduced effective renal plasma flow in both populations compared with normotensive subjects. The positive effect of ACEI, resulting in normalization of the effective renal plasma flow in essential hypertensive patients, suggests the involvement of both systems in impaired renal circulation.",

Maximum lisinopril doses significantly and safely reduced proteinuria, serum total, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides without substantially affecting serum HDL and renal hemodynamics. Proteinuria already decreased at 10 mg/d. Serum lipids progressively and dose-dependently decreased during uptitration to maximum doses. Reduction in total and LDL cholesterol correlated with increases in serum albumin/total protein concentration and oncotic pressure, peaked at lisinopril maximum doses, and persisted after treatment withdrawal. Despite less proteinuria reduction, hypercholesterolemia decreased more (and reflected the increase in serum albumin) in hypoalbuminemic than in normoalbuminemic patients who, despite more proteinuria reduction, had less decrease in cholesterol and no changes in serum albumin. Changes in serum triglycerides were independent of changes in serum proteins, were strongly correlated with lisinopril doses (r=-0.89, P=0.003) and recovered promptly after treatment withdrawal.

Resting FVR decreased during enalaprilat compared with vehicle or HOE 140, but not compared with baseline, and the effect was similar in the 2 groups (22.0+/-2.7 and 24.1+/-2.9 mm Hg x mL(-1) x min(-1) x 100 mL(-1), respectively, P=0.610). In contrast, enalaprilat significantly increased resting net t-PA release (from 0.6+/-0.4 to 1.7+/-0.6 ng. min(-1) x 100 mL(-1), P=0.002); this effect was abolished by HOE 140 (0.1+/-0.3 ng x min(-1) x 100 mL(-1), P=0.036 versus enalaprilat alone).

COS-1 cells transfected with naked mouse membrane-form klotho plasmid DNA (pCAGGS-klotho) translated proper Klotho protein. This translated Klotho protein was secreted into the culture medium. Furthermore, ACE activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was upregulated when HUVEC were co-cultured with COS-1 cells that were pre-transfected with pCAGGS-klotho. The conditioned medium from COS-1 cells pre-transfected with pCAGGS-klotho also dose-dependently upregulated ACE in HUVEC. In addition, the conditioned medium induced time- and dose-dependent enhancement of cAMP production in HUVEC. Rp-cAMP, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), inhibited the upregulation of ACE by Klotho protein. Our results suggest that mouse membrane-form Klotho protein acts as a humoral factor to increase ACE activity in HUVEC via a cAMP-PKA-dependent pathway.

A total of 143/386 (37.0%) were prescribed ACE-I during the hospital stay for cardiac reasons, including congestive heart failure (CHF) 52.8% and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) 47.2%. There were no significant differences in the rates of hypotension or arrhythmias in those who were treated with ACE-I versus those who were not. Survival analysis over three years, adjusted for known confounders, demonstrated a 37% reduction in all-cause mortality in those who received ACE-I, (p=0.0145).",

    "53": "Arterial wall stiffness, an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension, is worsened by the coexistence of diabetes mellitus. This randomised, prospective, double-blind, crossover trial assessed the effects of telmisartan on arterial stiffness in patients with Type 2 diabetes with essential hypertension. After a two-week placebo wash out period, 28 ambulatory patients received telmisartan (40 mg) or placebo for three weeks. Following a second two-week placebo wash out period, patients received the alternate treatment for a further three weeks. Augmentation index and central blood pressure (BP) were determined using the SphygmoCor device and pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured using an automatic device, the Complior trade mark, at the beginning and the end of each period. Telmisartan significantly reduced the carotid femoral PWV compared with placebo (mean adjusted treatment difference 0.95 m/s; 95% CI: 1.67, 0.23 m/s; p=0.013). Peripheral and central diastolic, systolic and pulse pressures were also significantly reduced with telmisartan compared with placebo. In conclusion, telmisartan reduces arterial stiffness and peripheral and central BPs as assessed by PWV and pulse contour analysis in hypertensive patients with Type 2 diabetes. These properties of telmisartan suggest that it may improve cardiovascular outcome in this patient population.", 
    "54": "Considerable attention has recently focused on the vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI), a new class of drug that combines angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor activity with inhibition of natriuretic peptide breakdown. In theory, a drug with these properties may be beneficial both in hypertension and in heart failure. Whilst the efficacy of VPIs in hypertension has been consistently demonstrated in pre-clinical and clinical studies, the role of VPIs, if any, in heart failure is less clear, since numerous small studies have produced conflicting results. Furthermore, preliminary results from the recently completed Omapatrilat Versus Enalapril Randomised Trial of Utility in Reducing Events (OVERTURE) study have failed to establish the VPI, omapatrilat, as a first line therapy in the treatment of chronic heart failure. We review the literature on VPIs in heart failure and discuss possible reasons for the reported lack of benefit over ACE inhibitors.",

It has been discovered that the potential uses of this class of treatment extend far beyond their initial developmental role as antihypertensives, and they are now used routinely in the treatment of heart failure, nephropathy, myocardial infarction and diabetes. However, there is more to RAAS blockade than just inhibition of angiotensin II, and inhibition of aldosterone is becoming recognised as an additional therapeutic manoeuvre in chronic heart failure. Since inhibition of the RAAS at the level of ACE is now seen to be an important therapy in diabetes; the purpose of this article is to explore the potential benefits of additional aldosterone inhibition in Type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Both of these classes of agents have a primary mechanism of action of reducing the level of the respective risk factor. They also have mechanisms of action that may confer benefits beyond what is believed to be the primary action of the agent. This has led to speculation that statins reduce stroke risk by means beyond cholesterol lowering, and ACE inhibitors reduce stroke risk by means beyond blood pressure lowering. We review the mounting evidence that suggests that statins and ACE inhibitors have so-called pleiotropic effects that may lead to stroke prevention.",

Angiotensin (Ang) converting enzyme inhibitors and Ang II type 1 receptor antagonists improve insulin resistance in patients with essential hypertension, which suggest that tissue Ang II is involved in insulin resistance in patients with hypertension. To investigate the participation of tissue Ang II in insulin resistance associated with hypertension, we evaluated the Ang II-generating system in leukocytes and its relation to insulin resistance in patients with essential hypertension. Eighteen patients with essential hypertension participated in this study. Ang II was separated from leukocytes by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and measured by radioimmunoassay. Insulin resistance was evaluated by determining the steady-state of plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration. The Ang I- and Ang II-generating activities were evaluated in human leukocytes. Human leukocytes have Ang I- and Ang II-generating activities. The Ang II-generating activity was significantly inhibited by pepstatin A. Leukocyte Ang II level does not correlate with BP or plasma Ang II level in patients with essential hypertension. Leukocyte Ang II level strongly correlates with SSPG concentration, and significantly correlates with body mass index and plasma insulin, and with leptin levels in patients with essential hypertension. Leukocyte Ang II may be directly associated with insulin resistance.", 
    "67": "Although several lines of recent studies fail to demonstrate the beneficial action of calcium antagonists, a novel dihydropyridine efonidipine, which possesses dilatory action of both afferent and efferent arterioles and, therefore, shares the renal microvascular action with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, is reported to exhibit renal protection in experimental animals. The present study evaluated the effect of efonidipine and ACE inhibitors on blood pressure (BP) and proteinuria. Sixty-eight hypertensive patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine, >1.5 mg/dL) or chronic renal parenchymal disease were randomly assigned to efonidipine or ACE inhibitor treatment. Of the 68 patients, 23 were treated with efonidipine and 20 with ACE inhibitors; these patients were analyzed for the 48-week study. Both efonidipine and ACE inhibitors produced a similar degree of reductions in BP (efonidipine, from 161 +/- 2/93 +/- 2 to 142 +/- 5/82 +/- 2 mm Hg; ACE inhibitor, from 163 +/- 3/95 +/- 2 to 141 +/- 5/83 +/- 2 mm Hg), and maintained creatinine clearance for 48 weeks. Proteinuria tended to decrease in both groups, and a significant reduction was observed in proteinuric patients (>1 g/day) (efonidipine, from 2.7 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 g/day; ACE inhibitor, from 3.0 +/- 0.4 to 2.0 +/- 0.5 g/day). Of interest, efonidipine decreased proteinuria in proteinuric patients who failed to manifest decreases in systemic BP. Finally, the incidence of adverse effects, including hyperkalemia and cough, was less in the efonidipine-treated group. Both efonidipine and ACE inhibitors preserved renal function in hypertensive patients with renal impairment. The antiproteinuric effect was apparent in patients with greater proteinuria. The beneficial action of efonidipine, along with fewer side effects, may favor the use of this agent in the treatment of hypertension with renal impairment.",

Cardiac baroreceptor reflex function curves were produced before and following 30 min intravenous (i.v.) infusion of 2.5 M NaCl, an equipressor concentration of phenylephrine, isotonic saline, or 2.5 M NaCl following central administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Hypertonic saline infusion increased blood pressure, reduced heart rate and baroreflex sensitivity (gain and range), and shifted the baroreflex function curve to a higher operating blood pressure. These effects were prevented or attenuated by prior central administration of an ACE inhibitor. Isotonic volume expansion did not alter baroreflex responses. Finally, phenylephrine produced similar changes in blood pressure but did not alter cardiac baroreflex responses. These data demonstrate that acute increases in peripheral osmolality and/or sodium decrease cardiac baroreflex sensitivity through generation of central angiotensin II, independent of changes in extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure.",

However, reported data are in part controversial and the mechanism of kinin effects on sperm motility is not yet understood. In the present report we describe a significant promoting effect of Bk on sperm motility at subnanomolar concentrations. This effect was stabilized and even increased by suppression of Bk hydrolysis in semen samples. As sperm membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral metalloendopeptidase are mainly involved in Bk hydrolysis, an effective cocktail of enzyme inhibitors promoting the sperm motility consists of phosphoramidon and lisinopril (both at 10-7 m). The effects of Bk on sperm cells are not mediated by the B2 Bk receptor. Using several biochemical, molecular and genetic methods we could not detect any Bk receptor on spermatozoa.", 
    "87": "One of the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure may derive from sympathoinhibition and the prevention of beta-adrenergic desensitization. However, the roles of these properties in the overall effects of ACE inhibitor are not clear. We studied the effects of chronic enalapril treatment (20 mg/L in drinking water for 12 weeks) on left ventricular (LV) function, cardiac norepinephrine (NE), sympathetic neuronal function assessed by 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), beta-receptors, and isometric contraction of papillary muscle in rats with myocardial infarction (MI) induced by coronary artery ligation. Decreased LV function in the MI rats was associated with reduced cardiac NE content and MIBG uptake, and severely blunted responses of non-infarcted papillary muscle to isoproterenol, forskolin, and calcium. Enalapril attenuated LV remodeling in association with a reduction of the ventricular loading condition and restored baseline developed tension of non-infarcted papillary muscle to the level of sham-operated rats. However, enalapril did not improve cardiac NE content, MIBG uptake, or inotropic responsiveness to beta-agonists. These results suggest that the major effect of the ACE inhibitor enalapril in the treatment of heart failure is not due to sympathoinhibition or restoration of beta-adrenergic pathway in this model of heart failure.",

A good linear relationship was observed between the inhibitor and the peak area of hippuric acid release. No significant difference in the ACE inhibitory activity (IC50) of captopril (an antihypertensive medicine) or autolyzed-mushrooms (functional foods) was observed between the conventional method and the MEKC method.

It causes morbidity and mortality due to persistent edema, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, thrombosis and infection. Progression to renal failure was thought to be inevitable in survivors. Recent insights into the pathogenesis of the disease has identified several responsible genes and proteins. Studies have shown that long term aggressive therapy with combinations of steroids, alkylating agents and cyclosporine, cause complete or partial remission in 20-80% patients. The use of nonspecific renal protective agents such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin 2 receptor blockers, and anti-lipid agents retard disease progression.

In the ACEI group, the peak VO2 did not change, but the LVEF (%) increased from 34.2 (10.2) to 40.4 (13.0).

These agents effectively reduce blood pressure and are well tolerated. Other clinical trials have focused, however, on the much wider use of angiotensin receptor blockers in conditions such as congestive heart failure, postmyocardial infarction management, and diabetic nephropathy. Recent studies have provided evidence that these agents might confer target organ protection in hypertension that is equal to, and possibly better than, the benefits provided by conventional antihypertensive agents. Moreover, there is now little doubt that these drugs are effective alternatives to ACE inhibitors in heart failure and will become treatments of choice for patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. Cardiovascular study outcomes have still not determined, however, whether high-risk patients would do better on angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or a combination of both, except in cases of intolerance to ACE inhibitors.",

Despite these effective therapies, event rates related to heart failure remain high. Although ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II production, they do not fully suppress the increased angiotensin II production in heart failure. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) directly block the effect of angiotensin II, derived from any source, at the receptor level and have the potential to be as effective or even more effective than ACE inhibitors. The results of a number of clinical studies have demonstrated ARBs are effective and well tolerated. However, no studies have demonstrated a convincing decrease in mortality with ARB use, although a decrease has been observed for heart failure hospitalization. The results from further studies are awaited to clarify the role of ARBs in the treatment of heart failure.",

Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have clearly been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in hypertensive white patients with heart failure, renal dysfunction, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction, African American patients have been underrepresented in these trials. The lack of direct evidence of the benefit of ACE inhibitors in these individuals and the suggestion that ACE inhibitors are less efficacious in this group has resulted in a reluctance to use ACE inhibitors in African Americans. However, retrospective analyses in black patients with heart failure and a recent randomized clinical trial in African Americans with renal dysfunction suggest that a regimen based on ACE inhibitors is efficacious in this racial group. Although diuretics remain first-line therapy, data now suggest that ACE inhibitors provide additional benefit and should be considered for use in patients with high-risk complications regardless of race.", 
    "99": "There is overwhelming evidence that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and target organ damage. Agents that regulate the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, are not only effective antihypertensive agents but can prevent target organ damage. Although diuretics remain the agents of first choice for the treatment of hypertension in African Americans, ACE inhibitors have a clear role in the management of these patients. ACE inhibitors (usually when used with a diuretic) have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patient groups. ACE inhibitors are infrequently used in African Americans because of a belief that these agents are ineffective in this racial group; however, when adequate dosing and appropriate combinations are used, ACE inhibitor therapy provides effective blood pressure control. In particular, the addition of diuretics to ACE inhibitor therapy ameliorates the racial differences in efficacy seen when ACE inhibitors are administered as monotherapy. Although further confirmation in additional clinical trials is required, increased use of these agents in African Americans will likely result in a reduction in target organ damage.",

The need for 24-hour blood pressure control has focused attention on whether all agents in this class maintain smooth antihypertensive effects over a 24-hour period. Insight into this issue emerged from a meta-analysis of five large, multicenter trials in which ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was used to compare the antihypertensive effects of three angiotensin II receptor blockers: telmisartan, losartan, and valsartan. These trials used either a double-blind, placebo-controlled or a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point design. Initial analysis established the validity of combining ambulatory blood pressure monitoring data from the double-blind, placebo-controlled and prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point designs. Subsequent analyses revealed that telmisartan 80 mg was significantly more effective than losartan 50 mg and valsartan 80 mg for reducing 24-hour mean blood pressure. Furthermore, telmisartan 80 mg was comparable to amlodipine 5 mg for controlling the early morning surge in blood pressure.", 
    "101": "Hypertension and arthritis are both common diseases in the older age group and require pharmacologic treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alter renal function if given in high enough doses, reducing renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate and causing sodium retention. In salt sensitive subjects, this retention of sodium will cause blood pressure to rise. Salt sensitivity is more common in elderly patients, in diabetics, and in people with renal failure. When most antihypertensive drugs are used, people become salt sensitive, as shown by the additive effect of salt restriction or diuretics on blood pressure response. The responses to dihydropyridine and possibly other calcium channel blocking drugs are not affected to any major extent by sodium intake or by diuretics. Studies are described which indicate that indomethacin elevates blood pressure in elderly people treated with enalapril, but not in people whose blood pressure is controlled with amlodipine or felodipine. It is unclear whether the various NSAIDs have different effects on blood pressure. It is proposed that if the same analgesic effect is achieved with the same amount of cyclooxygenase inhibition, the response will be similar. Aspirin, used in a prophylactic dose, does not inhibit to this extent and does not elevate blood pressure. If elderly people require NSAIDs, it would appear that dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking drugs are more effective at lowering and maintaining blood pressure control and should be one of the drugs used. If patients are on other antihypertensive agents, it is important to monitor blood pressure when a NSAID is added to therapy.", 
    "102": "Cardiovascular morbidity is a major burden in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the Steno-2 Study, we compared the effect of a targeted, intensified, multifactorial intervention with that of conventional treatment on modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.", 
    "103": "The primary end point of this open, parallel trial was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and amputation. Eighty patients were randomly assigned to receive conventional treatment in accordance with national guidelines and 80 to receive intensive treatment, with a stepwise implementation of behavior modification and pharmacologic therapy that targeted hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria, along with secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with aspirin.", 
    "104": "The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, and the mean follow-up was 7.8 years. The decline in glycosylated hemoglobin values, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels measured after an overnight fast, and urinary albumin excretion rate were all significantly greater in the intensive-therapy group than in the conventional-therapy group. Patients receiving intensive therapy also had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.73), nephropathy (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.87), retinopathy (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.86), and autonomic neuropathy (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.79).", 
    "105": "A target-driven, long-term, intensified intervention aimed at multiple risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria reduces the risk of cardiovascular and microvascular events by about 50 percent.", 
    "106": "There is evidence that the choroid has some autoregulatory capacity in response to changes in ocular perfusion pressure (OPP). The mediators of this response are hitherto unidentified. The hypothesis for the current study was that endothelin (ET)-1 and/or angiotensin (ANF)-II may be involved in choroidal vasoconstriction during an increase in OPP.", 
    "107": "To test this hypothesis a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, three way crossover study was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. Subjects received on different study days intravenous infusions of the specific ET(A) receptor antagonist BQ-123, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril or placebo. During these infusion periods subjects were asked to squat for 6 minutes. Choroidal blood flow was measured using a confocal laser Doppler flowmeter and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) was calculated from mean arterial pressure and intraocular pressure.", 
    "108": "BQ-123 and enalapril had no effect on basal blood pressure, pulse rate, intraocular pressure, or choroidal blood flow. During isometric exercise, a pronounced increase in mean arterial pressure paralleled by an increase in OPP was observed. Although choroidal blood flow slightly increased during squatting, the increase was much less pronounced than the increase in OPP, indicating some regulatory potential of the choroid. Enalapril did not alter the choroidal pressure-flow relationship during isometric exercise, but BQ-123 induced a significant leftward shift of the pressure-flow curve (P < 0.001).", 
    "109": "The present data indicate that ET-1, but not ANG II, plays a role in choroidal blood flow regulation during isometric exercise in healthy humans. Hence, impaired choroidal autoregulation in patients with ocular vascular diseases may arise from an altered endothelin system. Further studies in such patients are warranted to verify this hypothesis.", 
    "110": "We studied the effect of ramipril on proteinuria and mild hypertension in a 21-year-old patient affected by glycogen storage disease type I non-A. After few months of therapy we obtained a decrease in total urine protein excretion that later re-increased in spite of the high dose of ACE inhibitor. Even if ACE inhibitors are the only effective therapy for GSD I nephropathy, further studies are requested.", 
    "111": "The endothelium plays an essential role in regulation of vascular tone. It has vasodilator, antiaggregating, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties. In the case of endothelial dysfunction (induced by hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and/or diabetes), all of these properties are reversed; it becomes thrombogenic, it secretes vasoconstrictor substances promoting platelet aggregation and penetration of white blood cells into the vessel wall. This endothelial dysfunction then allows the development of the atheromatous lesion. The therapeutic approach must be based on restoration of the normal physiological properties of the endothelium.", 
    "112": "A large share of the pressure gradient in the vascular system is situated in the microcirculation. Most of the mechanisms resulting in an increase of peripheral resistances during hypertension are also located in this network. Experimental studies have shown that the functional characteristics of arterioles are profoundly modified in most hypertension models. The sensitivity to vasoconstrictor agonists is increased. The activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, situated in the arteriolar wall, is considerably greater in genetically hypertensive animals than in control animals. Endothelium-dependent vasodilator mechanisms are also decreased in these animals, while endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor factors are responsible for an increased smooth muscle response. These functional disorders are associated with structural modifications of the microvascular network. Changes of wall thickness are observed only inconstantly, but an initially functional then anatomical rarefaction of arterioles and capillaries has been observed in most experimental models of hypertension and in several clinical studies. This phenomenon reduces the capacities of adaptation of perfusion condition to changes in metabolic requirements of the various organs, reflecting the fact that the microcirculation is a target of hypertensive disease. Antihypertensive drugs should therefore be assessed not only in terms of the reduction of blood pressure figures, but also in terms of their capacity to prevent or correct structural changes of the microvascular network.", 
    "113": "The risk of interference with anaesthesia and the risk of decompensation of the disease must be considered for each drug. Beta-blockers reduce the body's capacity to react to hypovolaemia, but they are beneficial by limiting the response to nociceptive stimuli and by reducing the incidence of myocardial ischaemia. Treatment should therefore be continued. Interferences with the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers on peripheral vasomotor activity are moderate and additive. These agents are well tolerated and can be continued until the operation. Verapamil and diltiazem have a chronotropic and negative inotropic effect which is additive with that of anaesthetics. Administration of these drugs before the operation does not raise any major problems, nor does their discontinuation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, used in hypertension and heart failure, considerably reduce the tolerance of factors modifying the blood pressure equilibrium, especially hypovolaemia or haemorrhage. In practice, ACE inhibitors carry a risk of intraoperative hypotension, requiring the use of vasopressor amines to maintain blood pressure. Continuation of treatment has only minimal advantages, regardless of the indication and there is no risk of rebound effect after stopping treatment. The treatment washout period depends on the duration of action of the product. However, discontinuation of treatment is never imperative, regardless of the context.", 
    "114": "Pharmacological and validated treatment of chronic heart failure (HF) includes successively angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), beta-blockers and antialdosterone, which is associated with diuretics. The effectiveness of this manner in which to block more and more hormonal systems demonstrate the validity of the \"hormonal\" paradigm to explain heart failure. Therefore broader educational means are required to increase the prescription of these drugs for HF. Several questions about these drugs remain unresolved: HF with preserved systolic function and elderly patients, class effect, and the role of antagonists of angiotensin II receptors (as an alternative or associated with ACEi). Other short- and mid-term pharmacological perspectives target target hormonal systems and cytokines: endothelin-receptor antagonists, inhibition of natriuretic peptide degradation (via neutral endopeptidase), and newer drugs acting against TNF such as etanercept. Moreover, recent knowledge about molecular mechanisms of myocardium remodeling allows new drug strategies with target more specifically remodeling such as metalloproteinases. Finally, these perspectives should be largely modified by on-going research in the field of genomics.", 
    "115": "Hypertension is a risk factor for dementia, particularly vascular dementia. The objective of the \"Vascular Dementia\" project of the European multicentre Syst-Eur trial was to study the influence of antihypertensive therapy on the incidence of dementia in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension included in this trial. Patients were over the age of 60, with systolic blood pressure between 160 and 219 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mmHg in the sitting position and were not demented. After randomization, they were treated under double-blind conditions with nitrendipine associated with or replaced by enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide or an equivalent placebo. Cognitive functions were evaluated by the Mini-Mental State test (MMS) on inclusion then annually. When the MMS score was < or = 23, a complementary assessment was performed to establish the diagnosis of dementia according to DSM III-R criteria. The Modified Ischaemia score specified the aetiology of dementia. A total of 1180 and 1238 subjects were randomized to the placebo and active treatment groups, respectively. They presented comparable characteristics on inclusion. The median intent to treat duration of follow-up was 2.0 years. The incidence of dementia was decreased by 50%, from 7.7 per thousand patient-years in the placebo group to 3.8 per thousand patient-years in the active group (p = 0.05). There were 15 and 8 cases of dementia of the Alzheimer type, 4 and 3 cases of mixed dementia, 2 and 0 cases of vascular dementia in the placebo and active treatment groups, respectively. In conclusion, in subjects over the age of 60 years with isolated systolic HT, antihypertensive treatment initiated with nitrendipine can reduce the incidence of dementia.", 
    "116": "Very interesting results of several long-term studies concerning the treatment of hypertension were recently presented at the 18th \"Journ\u00e9es de l'Hypertension\" conference. Two of them are particularly interesting as, to our knowledge, they are the first studies designed to evaluate the use of fixed very low dose ACE inhibitor/diuretic bitherapy as first-line treatment for systolodiastolic hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension, over a long follow-up period. Both studies included hypertensive patients over the age of 65, and the only option left to the investigators was to adapt the dosage in the case of insufficient blood pressure control (suspine DBP > 90 mmHg). In particular, the results in the overall population show that 80% of patients \"controlled\" at 3 months, subsequently remained controlled throughout the study period (total of 15 months). The results obtained in isolated systolic hypertension were of the same order of magnitude. The results observed with this fixed very low dose ACE inhibitor/diuretic bitherapy appear very promising in terms of compliance with treatment and long-term blood pressure control, compared to those obtained with any other antihypertensive drugs indicated as first-line treatment of hypertension.", 
    "117": "The management of heart failure that has become refractory to conventional drug treatment is an increasingly frequent problem for clinicians. Peritoneal dialysis, by ultrafiltration, is an effective method to treat refractory oedema, thereby improving the functional symptoms of these patients. The objective of this article is to review the data, of the literature and to define the results and indications of this treatment, which still remains and exceptional modality.", 
    "118": "Treatment of acute coronary insufficiency in diabetics--recent myocardial infarction (MI--unstable angina--uses the same modalities as in the absence of diabetes. Thrombolytics improve the prognosis of MI, although the hospital mortality remains about two fold in the presence of diabetes. Primary angioplasty has an identical success rate, but restenoses are significantly more frequent in diabetics. Systematic use of stents allows a reduction of the restenosis rate to the level observed in the absence of diabetes. In unstable angina, low molecular weight heparins have an efficacy and a safety identical to those observed in non-diabetic patients. There is therefore no limitation to their use. Diabetics present permanent activation of blood platelets which promotes their adhesion and aggregation. Aspirin must therefore be systematically prescribed to diabetic patients, except in the presence of a contraindication, especially gastrointestinal, in which case, ticlopidine can be used. Platelet glycoprotein IIB-IIIA receptor inhibitors have the same indications and provide the same results as in the absence of diabetes. Contrary to a widely held belief, beta-blockers, especially cardioselective, can be widely used in diabetics. The same applies to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Finally, during the acute phase of coronary insufficiency, continuous insulin infusion via a pump ensures better control of diabetes and also decreases the mortality of MI. Permanent collaboration between cardiologists and diabetologists is therefore essential to increase the efficacy of treatment and to improve the prognosis of acute coronary insufficiency in diabetic patients.", 
    "119": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a cornerstone of therapy for heart failure. Large-scale clinical trials show that ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients and myocardial infarction (MI) survivors with left ventricular dysfunction. Cardiac remodeling is the term used to describe a series of prototypic changes in cardiac structure that occur in response to injury or prolonged increase in cardiac load. These changes include an increase in chamber volumes and muscle mass and changes in the configuration of the left ventricle. Remodeling results in a deterioration in cardiac function and plays a major role in the progression of heart failure. Although the ACE inhibitors have numerous effects that might be beneficial in heart failure patients, there is substantial evidence that their ability to inhibit cardiac remodeling is directly associated with a favorable impact on the clinical course. This article reviews evidence directly relating the administration of ACE inhibitors with an inhibition of structural remodeling of the heart in heart failure and post-MI patients.", 
    "120": "A major advance in understanding the pathophysiology of the heart failure syndrome has been an understanding of the process of left ventricular (LV) remodeling. After any insult to the left ventricle resulting in diminished systolic performance and stroke volume, a series of histopathologic changes in the myocardium and structural changes in the LV chamber occurs over time.", 
    "121": "Early work on understanding this process of LV remodeling emerged from the studies of Pfeffer and colleagues, who used a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). Compared to those with smaller MIs, rats with larger induced MIs underwent a substantially greater degree of chamber remodeling over time, and importantly, these structural changes were associated with significantly higher morality. These studies established for the first time the relation between the structural changes now widely known as LV remodeling and a natural history outcome in the setting of LV systolic dysfunction. Subsequently, these investigators demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril, when initiated soon after the induced MI, attenuated the remodeling process. Also observed was an improvement in survival among rats in whom the remodeling process has been attenuated. These important data paved the way for human studies that have subsequently provided substantial evidence to support two important concepts: (1) that LV remodeling is related to clinical outcomes that represent the natural history of the heart failure syndrome such as mortality and surrogate markers of the progression of heart failure, and (2) that therapeutic interventions in humans that slow or reverse the process of LV remodeling, such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, appear to have a favorable effect on that natural history.", 
    "122": "This review will examine the issue of the relation between LV remodeling and clinical outcomes in the human heart failure syndrome from several interrelated aspects: (1) the relation between LV volume at one time point and subsequent oucome, (2) the relation between changes in LV volumes over time (LV remodeling) and clinical outcomes, and (3) the relation between the effect of medical therapeutic interventions on the LV remodeling process and the effect of those same medical interventions on natural history outcomes in human heart failure.", 
    "123": "Acute myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world and the paramount goal is establishing early, complete, and sustained reperfusion at the myocardial tissue level. For hospitals without the capacity to perform emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, fibrinolytic therapy plays a critical role although it is limited by a 67% success rate. Despite promising pilot studies, reduced-dose fibrinolytic therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa therapy (GUSTO-V) and full-dose fibrinolytic therapy with enoxaparin (ASSENT-3) or bivalirudin (HERO-2) provide only marginally improved clinical outcomes. Adjunctive in-hospital and secondary preventive measures should include an aspirin, a beta-blocker, an ACE inhibitor, and a statin, based on the Heart Protection Study, unless contraindicated. Patients should be risk stratified, participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program, cease smoking tobacco, and have an intracardiac defibrillator (ICD) implanted if their LV systolic function is < or = 30% at one month based on the MADIT-2 trial.", 
    "124": "In the past few years diabetes has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in all Western countries. A correlation between blood pressure and rate of progression in diabetic nephropathy was noted very early, and increased local activity of the renin angiotensin system was identified as a major pathophysiological mechanism for proteinuria and nephrosclerosis in diabetic patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to slow progression of nephropathy in type 1 diabetic patients. The majority of diabetic patients with nephropathy, however, are suffering from type 2 diabetes and until last year there was no convincing evidence of ACE inhibitors being able to slow progression in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. Three new studies now fill this gap, showing that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are nephroprotective in patients with type 2 diabetes, independently of blood pressure. This review provides an in-depth discussion of the results of these studies and provides recommendations for patient management.", 
    "125": "We previously reported that several nitric oxide (NO) donors, guanylate cyclase activators, and cyclic GMP lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in rabbits.", 
    "126": "This study evaluated a novel method for studying cGMP production in the iris-ciliary body after the administration of different NO donors and guanylate cyclase activators. Tissue samples of porcine iris-ciliary body were incubated for 30 or 60 minutes with the test compounds and with or without the phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast. The concentration of cGMP in the iris-ciliary body as an indicator of soluble guanylate cyclase activation was measured by radioimmunoassay.", 
    "127": "The tested NO donors - SNOG, NONOate, NOR-3, and SNAP - were shown to release NO in incubation medium, and clearly increase cGMP concentration in the iris-ciliary body. Cyclic GMP production was 2-5 times higher with nitrosocaptopril and about 10 times higher with SNP than in the unstimulated control tissue incubation. Captopril, the reference for nitrosocaptopril, did not induce cGMP production in the porcine iris-ciliary body. ODQ, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, shut down the production of cGMP after the administration of nitrosocaptopril and SNP. The guanylate cyclase activators YC-1 and atriopeptin III increased cGMP dose-dependently.", 
    "128": "In this novel tissue incubation method, several NO donors and guanylate cyclase activators increased cGMP production in the porcine iris-ciliary body. This method can be used to screen new molecules in terms of cGMP production, since the ciliary body is important in lowering intraocular pressure.", 
    "129": "This article focuses on new findings leading to improved understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of potential drug interactions between anesthetic drugs or techniques and cardiovascular medications in patients scheduled for surgery. Only the most frequently used drugs are reviewed. Elective surgery provides the luxury to consider these risks and alter therapy accordingly. Under urgent circumstances, however, the increased risks associated with these agents should be anticipated with the goal to minimize adverse effects while maintaining optimal cardiovascular function in the perioperative period.", 
    "130": "To determine whether there was an increased incidence of nephrotoxicity in elderly patients (> or =65 y) prescribed single-dose (SD) versus multiple-dose (MD) aminoglycosides and whether aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity was associated with length of therapy and other risk factors.", 
    "131": "A prospective, observational audit at a university teaching hospital was conducted. Physician prescribing was used to stratify subjects according to dosing regimen: MD (n = 60) or SD (n = 26). Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL sustained over 2 days.", 
    "132": "Eighty-six patients were included; 9.3% developed nephrotoxicity, of whom 62.5% received SD therapy. The incidence of nephrotoxicity did not differ between regimens (p = 0.051). There was an increased length of therapy in those who developed nephrotoxicity (mean +/- SD 6.1 +/- 6.2 vs. 3.7 +/- 2.8 d; p = 0.044). Additionally, patients who developed nephrotoxicity had an increased length of hospitalization (20.3 +/- 16.1 vs. 8.4 +/- 5.4 d; p < 0.001). Nephrotoxicity correlated with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (OR 15.1; 95% CI 1.11 to 205), concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy (OR 28.0; 95% CI 2.15 to 365), and SD therapy (OR 20.7; 95% CI 1.45 to 297).", 
    "133": "Our overall incidence of nephrotoxicity is consistent with that reported in the literature. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, and SD regimens were risk factors for the development of nephrotoxicity. An adequately powered, randomized trial is needed to assess whether a difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity exists between SD and MD therapy in the elderly.", 
    "134": "Substrates of the proton-coupled peptide transporter, hPepT1, include dietary di- and tripeptides plus therapeutically important drugs such as the beta-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Expression and function of hPepT1 in the small bowel is well established. We have compared levels of hPepT1 mRNA expression in regions of human gut by RT-PCR methods and examined the expression of hPepT1 in normal human colon using an anti-hPepT1 antipeptide antibody. hPepT1 mRNA was expressed in the large intestine, although at lower levels than in the small intestine. Quantitatively, expression in ileum was 4.6-fold greater than in sigmoid colon. Immunoreactive hPepT1 was detected in human colon at lower levels than in ileum. The pattern of expression differed between the two tissues: whilst expression in the ileum was localised to the apical enterocyte membrane along the length of the crypt-villus axis, expression in the colonocyte was detected at the apical membrane towards the luminal surface but predominantly at the basal membrane towards the base of the crypt. We conclude that distal regions of the bowel express hPepT1, which may provide a mechanism for colonic protein-nitrogen absorption and for absorption of therapeutically important peptidomimetic drugs.", 
    "135": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of chronic (8-day) oral treatment with the dual angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase 24-11 (NEP) inhibitor mixanpril (25 mg/kg twice a day), compared with the ACE inhibitor captopril (25 mg/kg twice a day), on whole body insulin-mediated glucose disposal in young (10-week) and old (19-week) obese Zucker rats (ZOs). Moreover, the effects of chronic mixanpril administration on femoral blood flow at rest and during an insulin infusion were assessed. In the young ZOs, mixanpril decreased the glucose response during an IV glucose tolerance test more effectively than did captopril (-49 and -30%, respectively, p < 0.05). Incremental glucose area under the curve in mixanpril-treated ZOs was then no longer different from that observed in vehicle-treated lean rats (1,592 +/- 175 and 1, 470 +/- 104 mg/dl x min, respectively). The beneficial effects resulting from mixanpril or captopril administration were observed in ZOs but not in lean littermates. In the old ZOs, mixanpril induced higher glucose infusion rates to maintain euglycemia than did captopril during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test (+92 and +35%, respectively, p < 0.001). However, the glucose infusion rates in mixanpril-treated ZOs remained much lower than that observed in vehicle-treated lean rats (9.4 +/- 0.7 mg/kg/min vs 28.6 +/- 1.0 mg/kg/min, p < 0.001). Mixanpril did not affect resting femoral vascular bed hemodynamics but restored the femoral blood flow response to insulin infusion. In conclusion, in ZOs, chronic dual ACE/NEP inhibition improves whole body insulin-mediated glucose disposal more effectively than does ACE inhibition alone. This beneficial effect seems to be restricted to conditions of insulin resistance and not directly linked to the improvement in the femoral blood flow response to insulin.", 
    "136": "The current study aimed to demonstrate differences between angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and Ang II-AT1 receptor antagonism on full concentration-contraction responses to Ang I. Contraction responses to increasing concentrations of Ang I (1 nM-1 microM) were evaluated in organ baths in the presence of captopril (10 microM-1 mM) with or without a chymase inhibitor (1 microM soybean trypsin inhibitor), or irbesartan (0.1 nM-microM), in internal mammary arteries from 25 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Responses were expressed as a percentage of the control response to 10 microM phenylephrine. Captopril did not change the maximum response to Ang I (control: 46.3 +/- 6.3%, captopril: 43.0 +/- 4.6%). In contrast, 0.1 microM irbesartan completely blocked the maximum response to Ang I (from 45.8 +/- 6.7% to 1.9 +/- 1.9%, p < 0.001). However, addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor to captopril more effectively shifted -log pD2 than captopril alone (0.47 +/- 0.06 vs 0.95 +/- 0.14 log units, p = 0.007). Ang I-mediated effects are much more effectively inhibited by Ang II antagonism than by ACE inhibition. The incomplete effects of captopril on the inhibition of Ang II formation might be caused by alternative Ang II forming enzyme(s), as was demonstrated by the additive effects of soybean trypsin inhibitor added to captopril.", 
    "137": "Left ventricular (LV) remodelling following myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previous data suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a central role in the molecular events contributing to LV remodelling. We explored the effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition versus Ang II (AT(1)) receptor blockade on LV remodelling in mice post-MI. Mice underwent sham procedure or left coronary artery ligation, and received placebo, the AT(1) receptor antagonist, losartan or the ACE inhibitor, enalapril. At 6 weeks, echocardiography and haemodynamic studies were performed. Infarct size and interstitial collagen content were determined. Expression of genes encoding atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), collagen type I, AT(1a) and AT(1b) receptors were measured. The placebo MI group showed increased LV end-diastolic diameter, LV end-systolic diameter with depressed fractional shortening ( P <0.01 versus shams), increased LV mass and volume (both P <0.01 versus shams). The placebo MI group also exhibited increased non-infarct zone collagen content ( P <0.01), ANP ( P <0.01) and collagen type 1 ( P <0.01) gene expression, with a non-significant rise in AT(1a) receptor gene expression. Neither losartan or enalapril prevented LV dilation or improved fractional shortening. Both similarly lowered systolic blood pressure ( P <0.01 for each versus placebo). Losartan and enalapril inhibited LV hypertrophy ( P <0.01), and decreased ANP ( P <0.01) and collagen type 1 gene expression ( P <0.05). Levels of AT(1a) receptor gene expression were higher than shams ( P <0.05 for both), but similar to placebo. AT(1b) receptor gene expression was much lower than that for AT(1a) receptor and similar in all groups. Thus, in this model, AT(1) receptor antagonism and ACE inhibition have equivalent inhibitory effects on myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. These results serve as an important basis for planned investigations to evaluate the anti-remodelling effects of these agents on mice in which genetic manipulations are used to disrupt components of the Ang II signalling system.", 
    "138": "The National Cholesterol Education Program recognizes the importance of the metabolic syndrome and has published guidelines for its diagnosis. Weight loss, physical activity, and treatment of the individual risk factors constitute the main strategies for treatment. For now, the goals and methods of treating hypertension and dyslipidemia are the same in people with the metabolic syndrome as in the general population. Thiazolidinedione drugs increase insulin sensitivity, but their use in the metabolic syndrome is only speculative at present. We recommend they be used only as indicated to treat diabetes mellitus.", 
    "139": "Despite considerable progress in immunosuppressive therapy, the incidence and severity of transplant vasculopathy (TVP) after cardiac transplantation have not declined. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributing to TVP. We compared the effects of an angiotensin-II blocker, losartan (AT(1) blocker), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, on the incidence of diseased vessels and the severity of experimental TVP in the Lewis-to-Fischer rat heterotopic heart transplantation model. Recipients were randomly divided into six groups, group 1: no therapy, group 2: 3 mg/kg per day cyclosporine (CyA) s.c., group 3: CyA and 10 mg/kg per day losartan p.o., group 4: CyA and 40 mg/kg per day enalapril p.o., and groups 5 and 6: as groups 3 and 4, but additionally pre-treated with losartan or enalapril 7 days prior to transplantation. Eighty days after grafting, we assessed the incidence and severity of TVP, expressed as percentage of diseased vessels and mean vessel occlusion (MVO), by digitizing morphometry. CyA and CyA/enalapril post-treatment significantly reduced MVO, compared with controls, but not the incidence. Additional reduction of MVO was achieved in CyA/enalapril pre-treatment and both CyA/losartan pre- and post-treatment groups when compared with CyA and untreated controls. However, only losartan post-treatment in combination with CyA reduced both incidence and MVO. Our results validate the important role of the RAS in neointimal proliferation after cardiac transplantation. Losartan appears to be superior to enalapril in preventing TVP after experimental cardiac transplantation. Therefore, AT(1) blockade with losartan might be a therapeutic option for the prevention of TVP in human heart recipients.", 
    "140": "Elevated blood pressure is one of the most potent risk factors for first ever and recurrent stroke as well as influencing early outcome after acute stroke. There have been a number of significant randomized controlled trials which may influence management in each of these three categories.", 
    "141": "For primary prevention, the recent information from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation, Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction to Hypertension, Study on Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly and Australian National Blood Pressure Study support the view that blood pressure lowering protects against stroke regardless of baseline blood pressure level. There is some evidence that blockade of the angiotensin system may give additional protection. For secondary prevention, evidence from the Perindopril Protection against Recurrent Stroke Study shows that blood pressure lowering with perindopril based therapy reduces fatal or non-fatal stroke events, again in hypertensive or normotensive individuals. There is uncertainty about blood pressure lowering in acute stroke, although presentation of the recent Acute Candesartan Cilexetil Evaluation in Stroke Survivors trial in which there was significant protection against vascular events using candesartan suggests that further studies should be undertaken.", 
    "142": "Blood pressure lowering for primary prevention of stroke should be undertaken using a variety of therapeutic agents. For secondary stroke prevention perindopril based therapy should be used based on current evidence. Uncertainty still exists as to whether blood pressure lowering in the acute stroke setting is safe or improves outcomes.",

Cardiac interstitial collagen, perivascular collagen and media/lumen ratio of coronary arterioles were increased in HT rats. Both treatments partially prevented the rise in perivascular collagen and completely corrected the increased media/lumen ratio in small arterioles from HT (P <0.05). In contrast to NT rats, only a weak coronary dilatation to bradykinin was observed in Langendorff hearts isolated from untreated-HT. This response was slightly improved by lisinopril and markedly improved by omapatrilat (P <0.05). The coronary dilatation to SNP which was reduced in 4-week HT (P <0.05), was partially improved by omapatrilat treatment but not by lisinopril.

The second is a lack of awareness of relevant research evidence in what was perceived to be a complex and rapidly changing therapeutic field. Doubts about the applicability of research findings in primary care, and fear of information overload also emerged. The third category consists of influences of individual preference and local organisational factors.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether ACE inhibition at high or low doses affects glomerular capillary surface area and length, glomerular number or total renal filtration surface area in rats with established hypertension and, if so, to determine whether these effects are mediated through bradykinin potentiation. 2. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated with the ACE inhibitor perindopril at either 3 or 0.1 mg/kg per day (high and low doses, respectively) from 16 to 24 weeks of age. Some rats were concomitantly treated with the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist S16118 (10 nmol/kg per day). Blood pressure was measured twice weekly during the treatment period. At 24 weeks of age, rats were perfusion fixed at 140 mmHg, the kidneys removed, embedded in resin and examined stereologically to estimate glomerular number and volume, length and surface area of glomerular capillaries and total renal filtration surface area. 3. High- and low-perindopril treatment significantly reduced systolic blood pressure compared with control SHR. However, the rats treated with low-dose perindopril were still considered hypertensive. Neither low-dose nor high-dose perindopril treatment had any observable effect on glomerular number (23 876 +/- 1201 vs 26 240 +/- 1465 glomeruli/kidney, respectively) or volume (2.25 +/- 0.21 and 1.96 +/- 0.06 x 10-3 mm3, respectively) compared with controls (glomerular number 25866 +/- 1210 glomeruli/kidney; glomerular volume 2.24 +/- 0.21 x 10-3 mm3).

Coadministration of the bradykinin antagonist had no observable effect on any of the parameters studied. 4.

    "171": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a highly glycosylated type I integral membrane protein. A series of underglycosylated testicular ACE (tACE) glycoforms, lacking between one and five N-linked glycosylation sites, were used to assess the role of glycosylation in tACE processing, crystallization and enzyme activity. Whereas underglycosylated glycoforms showed differences in expression and processing, their kinetic parameters were similar to that of native tACE. N-glycosylation of Asn-72 or Asn-109 was necessary and sufficient for the production of enzymically active tACE but glycosylation of Asn-90 alone resulted in rapid intracellular degradation. All mutants showed similar levels of phorbol ester stimulation and were solubilized at the same juxtamembrane cleavage site as the native enzyme. Two mutants, tACEDelta36-g1234 and -g13, were successfully crystallized, diffracting to 2.8 and 3.0 A resolution respectively. Furthermore, a truncated, soluble tACE (tACEDelta36NJ), expressed in the presence of the glucosidase-I inhibitor N -butyldeoxynojirimycin, retained the activity of the native enzyme and yielded crystals belonging to the orthorhombic P2(1)2(1)2(1) space group (cell dimensions, a=56.47 A, b=84.90 A, c=133.99 A, alpha=90 degrees, beta=90 degrees and gamma=90 degrees ).

An AII receptor antagonist (losartan or candesartan) was administered. Before and 6 months after the administration, MIBG myocardial imaging and echocardiography were performed, and neurohumoral factors were investigated. MIBG imaging revealed that the antagonist did not significantly change the heart-to-mediastinum ratio. However, the washout rate fell significantly (from 32.6% +/- 7.6% to 28.2% +/- 7.5%; P < 0.001). No significant changes occurred in LV diameter, fractional shortening, or LV ejection fraction. Circulating atrial (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptides (BNP), and aldosterone fell significantly. Changes in the MIBG washout rate correlated positively with changes in BNP ( r = 0.35, P < 0.05). In 19 patients also being treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the MIBG washout rate also fell significantly with AII antagonists, as did BNP and aldosterone. The decreased MIBG washout and BNP in patients with CHF induced by the AII receptor antagonists suggests the efficacy of these agents in modifying cardiac sympathetic function and neurohumoral factors, even with ACE inhibition.

Notably, these inhibitors were developed without knowledge of the structure of human ACE, but were instead designed on the basis of an assumed mechanistic homology with carboxypeptidase A. Here we present the X-ray structure of human testicular ACE and its complex with one of the most widely used inhibitors, lisinopril (N2-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-lysyl-L-proline; also known as Prinivil or Zestril), at 2.0 A resolution. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of ACE shows that it bears little similarity to that of carboxypeptidase A, but instead resembles neurolysin and Pyrococcus furiosus carboxypeptidase--zinc metallopeptidases with no detectable sequence similarity to ACE.

Correct diagnosis and treatment for pulmonary edema, the most common acute manifestation of CHF, are of primary importance as misdiagnosis can result in deleterious consequences to patients. The pathogenesis of acute pulmonary edema (APE) is currently believed to arise primarily from the redistribution of intravascular fluid to the lungs secondary to acutely elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures. This understanding has provided a basis for the management of acute APE, which entails reduction of LV preload, reduction of LV afterload, ventilatory support, inotropic support as needed, and identification and treatment of other underlying factors contributing to elevated LV filling pressures. The agent most applicable and effective for field treatment is nitroglycerin. Diuretics and morphine should be used with caution, as they carry higher risks, especially in misdiagnosed patients. The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has yet to be demonstrated in a prehospital setting. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation methods are effective adjuncts to current treatment, but their mode of delivery presents technical challenges. The development of novel rapid diagnostic tools, currently in progress, might prove valuable for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel in the future.

Twenty subjects with CHF (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 28+/-9%, New York Heart Association class II [n=13] and III [n=7]) were studied. There was no correlation between plasma Ang II levels and PD20.

To test these hypotheses, WKY and SHR were uninephrectomized (UNX) and treated with either vehicle, enalapril, NS398 or enalapril+NS398. NS398 did not affect systolic blood pressure nor antagonize the antihypertensive effect of enalapril. Urinary protein excretion in UNX WKY was significantly decreased after treatment with either enalapril or NS398. In UNX SHR, enalapril reduced proteinuria, but NS398 alone had no effect. Administration of both drugs, however, further reduced proteinuria. In UNX WKY, treatment with either NS398 alone or both drugs reduced glomerular volume and similar results were observed in SHR. Surprisingly, these results disprove our original hypothesis and suggest that inhibition of COX-2 provides additional renoprotection to that of enalapril alone.", 
    "192": "We recently reported that myocardial phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism can be visualised by 1-[1-11C]-butyryl-2-palmitoyl-rac-glycerol (11C-DAG) in rats with myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin II, the receptors for which are expressed predominantly in infarcted areas with active fibrogenesis rather than in non-infarcted regions, is involved in the upstream signalling systems of PI metabolism and plays an important role in the process of left ventricular (LV) remodelling after MI. We therefore hypothesised that the distribution of 11C-DAG after MI may be affected by the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, which is one of the most important factors in the development of LV remodelling after MI. Rats were injected with 11C-DAG after 3 or 10 weeks of treatment with captopril or no treatment following coronary artery ligation, and quantitative autoradiography was performed. Cells occupying the infarcted region were identified by immunohistochemistry. Compared with untreated rats, treatment with captopril for 3 weeks after MI elicited a reduction in the 11C-DAG uptake in the infarcted region (P<0.05) but not in the non-infarcted region, and was associated with a 22% decrease in the heart weight/body weight ratio. The thallium-201 distribution in the infarcted area was similarly low in the rats with and rats without the 3-week captopril treatment after MI. Abundant macrophages and myofibroblasts occupied the infarcted area in both rats with and rats without the captopril treatment for 3 weeks after MI. The 11C-DAG radioactivity in the infarcted region in the untreated rats was lower 10 weeks after MI than 3 weeks after MI (P<0.01). This finding was in agreement with the results of immunohistochemistry demonstrating that the number and size of macrophages and myofibroblasts were remarkably reduced in rats 10 weeks after MI compared with 3 weeks after MI. Captopril treatment for 10 weeks after MI did not decrease the 11C-DAG radioactivity in the infarcted area further. These data suggest that 11C-DAG is useful for visually detecting regions with activated PI metabolism after MI, and that captopril reduces PI metabolism in the infarcted region in the relatively early phase of MI, which might contribute to the attenuation of ventricular remodelling.",

Patients with health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance were much less likely than fee for service (FFS) patients to follow the JNC guidelines in this respect (odds ratio 0.50, P <.01), controlling for all other factors. Individuals with all other public insurance and no insurance were not statistically different from the FFS group in the use of the study drugs. Other significant factors in the regression model were being of African American descent, being unmarried, having higher out-of-pocket payment, being in excellent physical health, having diabetes, and being diagnosed with essential hypertension after 1988.

    "221": "Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.",

The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).",

    "225": "Medical drugs are usually grouped together because they exhibit identical or similar chemical and pharmacological properties. Thus, for example, all known statins lower morbidity and mortality in coronary patients. In the meantime, three beta blockers have been shown to have a life-prolonging effect in mild-to-moderate cardiac insufficiency. The question is: to what extent are the preparations interchangeable? The beta blockers in particular manifest numerous other properties--such as beta 1 selectivity, vasodilatory or antioxidative actions which, under certain circumstances may even be decisive for the success or failure of treatment. The mortality-lowering effect of high-dose ACE inhibitors in patients with a high cardiovascular risk has to date, been shown only for a single preparation. For others, the high dose (effect) has yet to be confirmed. Also, with every new substance, a new side effect profile is introduced, which may result from the tiniest alteration to the active agent molecule, but also by a different preparation method. In consequence, unexpected effects, such as allergic reactions, may occur. This not only makes the grouping of similar substances, but also the interchange of \"me-too\" or generic preparations, problematic.",

A formulation of 1-mg/mL oral suspension was prepared from commercially available 20-mg lisinopril tablets, using Bicitra and Ora-Sweet SF as the compounding vehicles to make a final volume of 200 mL. Individual samples, stored in 8-oz amber polyethylene terephthalate bottles, were used for each test performed. All samples were stored at 25 degrees C. Appropriateness of the extemporaneous preparation method was performed by shaking three lots of each suspension for 30, 60, and 90 seconds. To test the robustness and reproducibility of the method, two chemists prepared the suspensions from the same three lots of lisinopril tablets. Chemical and physical stability were established by analyzing duplicate samples at time zero and after one, two, four, and six weeks. The solubility of lisinopril was tested from suspensions stored for four weeks. In-use stability was also examined over four weeks. Photochemical stability was examined by exposing three batches of the suspension to maximum light stress in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization. Antimicrobial-effectiveness testing was also conducted with freshly prepared suspensions and suspensions stored for six weeks. The preparation method used was appropriate and effective. Lisinopril is fully dissolved in the suspension matrix. Satisfactory chemical, physical, and microbiological results were obtained after the suspensions were stored for six weeks at 25 degrees C and 35% relative humidity. Lisinopril suspensions extemporaneously prepared from tablets are stable for at least four weeks when stored at or below 25 degrees C under ambient light exposure.", 
    "227": "Several recent studies have shown that essential hypertension is associated with increased oxidative stress, which may cause hypertension via enhanced oxidation and inactivation of nitric oxide. In this study, we investigated the malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and glutathione levels in newly diagnosed essential hypertensive patients and whether or not there was any effect of antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, losartan or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril on plasma malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and glutathione values. We selected 17 patients (F/M: 10/7, mean age: 46.12 +/- 9.2 years) for enalapril therapy (10-20 mg/d) and 14 patients (F/M: 8/6, mean age: 47.7 +/- 7.5 years) for losartan therapy (50-100 mg/d), and compared them with 12 normotensive controls. At the beginning of the study, both treated groups showed significantly higher plasma malondialdehyde and lower glutathione and nitric oxide in exhaled air compared to the control group. After 9 weeks of enalapril and losartan treatment, both systolic and diastolic pressure were significantly reduced. Both enalapril and losartan produced a significant decrease in plasma malondialdehyde and a significant increase in plasma glutathione levels and nitric oxide in exhaled air after 9 weeks. Initial values of plasma nitrate levels in patient groups were similar to the control group and increased significantly after the treatment period. In conclusion, both losartan and enalapril may be regulators between oxidant stress and the antioxidant system.",

Organ specific therapy may show significant benefit, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in renal crisis and epoprostenol in primary pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "235": "Scleroderma renal crisis occurs most often during the first years of the disease, in patients with systemic sclerosis and evolving cutaneous lesions. Clinically, it is responsible for severe hypertension, sometimes associated with cardiac failure or neurological symptoms. Laboratory tests disclose rapidly progressive renal failure, and often signs of thrombotic microangiopathy. If performed (which is rarely the case), renal biopsy shows scleroderma-induced chronic vascular lesions, but also vascular lesions that are secondary to malignant hypertension. The cornerstone of treatment is blood pressure control using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, often in association with other antihypertensive agents. It has to be started as early as possible, in order to optimise vital and renal prognosis.",

Furthermore, arterial compliance (AC) disorders assessed by increased aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) are closely related to changes in blood pressure and strongly correlated with cardiovascular mortality and presence or extent of atherosclerosis. Our purpose in the present study was to determine a relationship between AC using PWV and UAE in a group of non-smoking patients with essential hypertension, and the level of interaction of ACE inhibition on these two variables. A total of 70 non-smoking never treated hypertensive patients (33 men and 37 women), aged 50 +/- 7 years (range 35-69), have been enrolled in this study. All of them underwent PWV by a computerized device (Complior) and UAE determination by radial immunodiffusion method, on baseline and after six months of treatment with perindopril (4.6 +/- 1.4 mg/day). We have found a significant decrease of systolic blood pressure (160.2 +/- 10.6 vs. 131.9 +/- 7.1 mmHg, p < 0.01), diastolic blood pressure (100.6 +/- 5 vs. 81.6 +/- 4.8 mmHg, p < 0.01), PWV (13.4 +/- 1 vs. 9.1 +/- 0.9 m/sec, p < 0.01), and UAE (42.2 +/- 19.3 vs. 11.1 +/- 3.6 mg/day, p < 0.01) at the end of the sixth month when they were compared to baseline values. Furthermore, renal function was also improved by the treatment at the end of the study as illustrated by creatinine clearance (87.5 + 22.5 vs. 102.1 + 23.5 ml/min, p < 0.01). Moreover, a high positive correlation between UAE and PWV at the beginning of the study (r = 0.81; p < 0.01) and after six months of treatment (r = 0.66; p < 0.01) was observed. In addition, PWV vs. UAE, differences between sixth month and baseline have shown a high correlation (r = 0.67; p < 0.01) and using a multiple regression test we found that PWV (t ratio 5.76; p < 0.001) was the most important and significant independent variable that correlates with UAE. These results suggest the existence of a real link between UAE and AC in non-smoking patients with arterial hypertension, and that ACE inhibition can similarly modify these two parameters.", 
    "237": "Medical treatment of chronic heart failure is applied in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force Report of the European Society of Cardiology [9] adapted to the respective NYHA stage of the cardiac failure. Currently, it includes the use of ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, AT1 receptor antagonists, diuretics including the aldosterone antagonists, and digitalis. While a positive impact on the prognosis has been confirmed for ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists, this is not the case for diuretics and digitalis. These substance groups are used in the treatment of chronic heart failure because of their morbidity-lowering action. The objective of more recent therapeutic concepts is to block neurohumoral achses or local maladaptation processes (e.g. endothelial antagonists, cytokine inhibition, apoptosis inhibition) activated during the heart failure, or to promote protective mechanisms (e.g. endopeptidase inhibition).

    "242": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or ACEH) is a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase that cleaves a single amino acid from angiotensin I, des-Arg bradykinin, and many other bioactive peptides. Using des-Arg bradykinin as a template, we designed a series of intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide substrates for ACE2. The general structure of the substrates was F-X-Q, in which F was the fluorescent group, Abz, Q was the quenching group (either Phe(NO(2)) or Tyr(NO(2))), and X was the intervening peptide. These substrates were selectively cleaved by recombinant human ACE2, as shown by MS and HPLC. Quenching efficiency increased as the peptide sequence was shortened from 8 to 3 aa, and also when Tyr(NO(2)) was used as a quenching group instead of Phe(NO(2)). Two of the optimized substrates, TBC5180 and TBC5182, produced a signal:noise ratio of better than 20 when hydrolyzed by ACE2. Kinetic measurements with ACE2 were as follows: TBC5180, K(m)=58 microM and k(cat)/K(m)=1.3x10(5)M(-1)s(-1); TBC5182, K(m)=23 microM and k(cat)/K(m)=3.5 x 10(4)M(-1)s(-1). Thus, based on hydrolysis rate, TBC5180 was a better substrate than TBC5182. However, TBC5180 was also hydrolyzed by ACE, whereas TBC5182 was not cleaved, suggesting that TBC5182 was a selective for ACE2. We conclude that these two peptides can be used as fluorescent substrates for high-throughput screening for selective inhibitors of ACE2 enzyme.", 
    "243": "Nitric oxide is involved in the regulation of resting vascular tone, adaptation of blood flow to metabolic demand of tissue, and adaptation of vessel diameter to volume of inflow, ie, flow-mediated dilation. Arterial hypertension is associated with an increased vascular tone of resistance vessels, a reduced compliance of conduit arteries, along with a thickening of the intima-media leading to vascular remodeling. Dysfunctional endothelium triggers such maladaptive processes. A reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide has been shown in hypertensive individuals dependent on the duration and severity of arterial hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reverse endothelial dysfunction, whereas a concomitant reduction in significant cardiac events due to improved bioavailability has yet to be established. Long-term follow-up studies in individuals with manifest endothelial dysfunction and in offspring from hypertensive patients underscore the prognostic and genetic significance of a reduced nitric oxide bioavailability for the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension.", 
    "244": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists has resulted in beneficial effects in essential hypertensive patients. However, occurrence of cardiovascular events has not been appropriately controlled beyond a certain percentage. One reason could be the effects of aldosterone, the final component of the system. The aldosterone escape phenomenon could explain undesirable outcomes observed in hypertensive patients even under treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin antagonists. Aldosterone has direct effects on the vasculature and has been associated with vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, cardiac fibrosis, proteinuria, and renal vascular injury. Animal models and clinical trials have proven the benefit of aldosterone receptor antagonism. With increased recognition of the prevalence of hyperaldosteronism in patients thought to have \"essential\" hypertension, the use of drugs that block aldosterone action may become more widespread and protect the vasculature from the deleterious effects of aldosterone.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve exercise capacity in adults with congestive heart failure by improving diastolic function and decreasing SVR. We tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors decrease SVR and improve exercise capacity in patients after intraatrial baffle procedure for TGA. We studied the effects of enalapril in nine patients with TGA s/p intraatrial switch (mean age, 13.8 +/- 3 years) 7 to 21 years (mean, 12 +/- 4 years) after intraatrial baffle procedure. Enalapril (0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum dosage 20 mg bid) was administered for 12 months. Patients exercised using a cycle ergometer ramp protocol (0.25 W/kg/min) before enalapril (baseline), 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after treatment initiation. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, oxygen consumption (VO2), total exercise time, work, and power were measured. SVR, cardiac index, and stroke volume index (SVI) were calculated. Two-tailed paired Student's t-test was used to compare data to those of normal control patients and the patients' baseline data. Patients had lower resting heart rate, cardiac index, maximum heart rate, cardiac index (CI), SVI, VO2, exercise time, work, and power and higher maximal SVR at baseline compared to normal control patients. There was no significant difference in total exercise time, work, power, VO2 (rest/peak), SVR, SVI, and CI after 12 months of therapy compared to patients' baseline values. We conclude that short-term (<1 year) use of enalapril does not improve exercise performance in patients with TGA in whom the intraatrial baffle procedure has been performed.",

    "253": "On multivariable analysis, the researchers found 11 risk factors: 6 noted by history (nonwhite ethnicity, lack of exercise, treated diabetes, angina, congestive heart failure, and more than one previous myocardial infarction) and 5 that were measured (blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, lipoprotein(a) level, and creatinine clearance). The annual rate of coronary events was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.7% to 2.5%) in women with no risk factors and 8.7% (CI, 7.1% to 10.8%) in women with five or more risk factors (a sixfold increase). At entry into HERS, 83% of participants were receiving aspirin or other antiplatelet agents, 33% were receiving beta-blockers, 18% were receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and 53% were receiving lipid-lowering drugs. Women with more risk factors were less likely to be taking aspirin (P < 0.001) and lipid-lowering drugs (P = 0.006).", 
    "254": "Women with coronary disease are at high risk for myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease even in the absence of other risk factors, and their risk increases up to sixfold when many risk factors are present. Established drugs for secondary prevention, including aspirin, beta-blockers, and lipid-lowering agents, are underused in these women, especially those at highest risk.", 
    "255": "The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the effect of traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-specific-2 inhibitors (coxibs) on renal function. Both COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) constitutively are expressed in the adult mammalian kidney and contribute to the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (PGs). Inhibition of COX activity in the kidney by NSAIDs has relatively mild consequences in healthy individuals, but can lead to serious adverse events in patients whose renal function is PG dependent. Most studies have reported transient decreases in sodium excretion upon initiation of therapy with either traditional NSAIDs or coxibs. In patients whose renal function is dependent on prostanoids, both nonselective NSAIDs and coxibs can affect the glomerular filtration rate. Changes in renal function may result in hypertension and edema. Several studies have compared the effects of traditional NSAIDs, celecoxib, and rofecoxib on blood pressure and incidence of edema, but the results have not been consistent, as the trials used different clinical models and study designs. No trials to date have been performed with rigorous study designs that allow meaningful drug comparisons at comparably effective doses. In consequence, patients who are at risk for adverse renal events should be monitored with the same caution when receiving coxibs as when receiving treatment with nonselective NSAIDs. They include patients with congestive heart failure or renal or hepatic disease, as well as those of advanced age receiving therapy with diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.", 
    "256": "We present a two-part review of the English-language literature pertaining to drug therapy for systemic high BP in patients with pulmonary diseases. Part I examines the literature pertaining to the use of antihypertensive drugs in patients with systemic hypertension and coexisting pulmonary conditions, especially COPD and asthma. Part II of the series reviews studies assessing the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (including the role of the sympathetic nervous system) and systemic hypertension, and presents an approach to the management of these patients. It is the aim of both parts of this review to make qualified conclusions and recommendations applying a methodologic critique to assess the current literature. In the first part of this series, we review the demographics of hypertension in patients with COPD. This is followed by an extensive review of the use of specific classes of antihypertensive drug therapies in patients with pulmonary disease. The antihypertensive agents reviewed include diuretics, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and alpha-beta-blockers and other non-beta-blocker classes. Additionally, the renin angiotensin system is briefly reviewed, with a discussion of how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors induce cough, especially in pulmonary and congestive heart failure patients.", 
    "257": "In this multicentre, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) study, the efficacy of 12 weeks' treatment with once-daily telmisartan 40-80 mg and enalapril 10-20 mg was evaluated using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 522 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Patients were titrated to the higher dose of study drug at week 6 if mean seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was > or = 90 mmHg. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in ambulatory DBP in the last 6 h of the 24-h dosing interval after 12 weeks' treatment. Telmisartan and enalapril produced similar reductions from baseline in DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP) over all ABPM periods evaluated (last 6 h, 24-h, daytime and night-time). Telmisartan produced a significantly greater reduction in mean seated trough DBP, measured unblinded with an automated ABPM device in the clinic, amounting to a difference of -2.02 mmHg (P < 0.01). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved a seated diastolic response with telmisartan than enalapril (59% versus 50%; P < 0.05), also measured with the same ABPM device. Both treatments were well tolerated. Compared with telmisartan, enalapril was associated with a higher incidence of cough (8.9% versus 0.8%) and hypotension (3.9% versus 1.1%). Therefore, telmisartan may provide better long-term compliance and, consequently, better blood pressure control than enalapril.", 
    "258": "Angiotensin-receptor blockers have been part of the antihypertensive treatment armamentarium since the mid-1990s. During this period, the number of agents has increased greatly, as has the number of indications for which these drugs are being tested in randomized controlled clinical trials. Beginning as efficacious and very well tolerated antihypertensives, angiotensin-receptor blockers have been shown to have benefits in patients with diabetes and heart failure that are not only attributable to the reduced blood pressure, as supported by recently concluded trials. The expanding treatment areas with these agents widen the interest in their applicability across the entire cardiovascular continuum. A number of large-scale studies set to report within the next few years will further determine the effects of angiotensin-receptor blockers in a range of cardiovascular indications beyond hypertension.", 
    "259": "To compare the antihypertensive effect of two daily single dose drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin axis by two different ways.", 
    "260": "Thirty patients were randomized to receive either irbesartan (150 mg once daily) (n = 15, mean age 65.2 +/- 8.7 years, 9 men and 6 women) or fosinopril (20 mg once daily) (n = 15, mean age 57.4 +/- 11.5 years, 4 men and 11 women, difference are not significant) during 12 weeks. When needed, hydroclorothiazide (12.5 mg) was added to treatment to improve hypotensive response.", 
    "261": "A reduction of SBP and DBP was observed in both treatment groups throughout the study. In order to obtain further BP reduction, hydrochlorothiazide was added to 6 patients with inadequate BP response at the 4th week (3 patients in the irbesartan group) and 8th week (2 patients in irbesartan group and 1 patient in fosinopril group). SBP was reduced in irbesartan group from 157.7 +/- 11.2 to 131.0 +/- 8.7 mmHg (12th week, p < 0.001). DBP decreases from 94.1 +/- 5.6 to 82.7 +/- 4.2 mmHg (p < 0.001). In fosinopril group SBP was reduced from 147.9 +/- 11.7 to 132.2 +/- 12.4 mmHg (p < 0.001) and DBP decreases from 92.3 +/- 6.3 to 84.0 +/- 5.4 mmHg (p < 0.001). Final between group differences in BP are not significant. Final BP reduction in irbesartan group (26.7 +/- 11.6 mmHg) was bigger than that obtained in fosinopril group (15.6 +/- 11.6 mmHg, p = 0.011). BP reduction was significant in fosinopril group from the first month (SBP 140.7 +/- 12.2, p = 0.021; DBP 87.2 +/- 6.2, p = 0.003). In irbesartan group BP reduction was not significant until the second month (SBP 135.5 +/- 10.4, p < 0.001; DBP 85.3 +/- 4.3, p < 0.001).", 
    "262": "Fosinopril and irbesartan seems to be equally effective to reduce DBP. Irbesartan might have higher effectiveness on systolic blood pressure. Irbesartan act more gradually than fosinopril and this may be useful to prevent from acute blood pressure falls.", 
    "263": "This multicentre study was aimed at comparing the trough effect of telmisartan and perindopril on diastolic blood pressure (DBP), using self blood pressure measurement (SBPM). A second objective was to compare the data obtained from SBPM with those provided by automatic office BP measurement. A total of 441 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients were randomised to receive either telmisartan 40 mg or perindopril 4 mg for a period of 12 weeks. Patients whose clinic DBP remained higher than or equal to 90 mmHg at the end of the 6th week (W6) were given a double-dose regimen. Office BP and SBPM were performed at baseline (W0), at W6 and at week 12 (W12), both with the same automatic device. A greater diminution of trough DBP was obtained with telmisartan (-6.6+/-6.7 mmHg) than with perindopril (-5.1+/-7.0 mmHg; P=0.018). Regarding clinic BP, the same results were observed. Doubling dose was significantly less frequent with telmisartan (41%; n=85) than with perindopril (55%; n=115, P=0.005). Mean values of SBPM were lower than office BP values, with a difference of a greater importance at W0 than at W12: 6.6 vs 4.7 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (P<0.005) and 3.2 vs 1.4 mmHg for DBP (P<0.0001). At W12, isolated office hypertension was found in 9% of the patients (n=37), while there were 14% of the patients (n=55) with isolated home hypertension. In conclusion, the trough effect on DBP was statistically higher with telmisartan than with perindopril. SBPM values were lower than office BP values, with greater differences before than after treatment. About a quarter of the patients were found to be controlled with a method but not with the other one.", 
    "264": "The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to treat hypertension has recently increased. However, their use is associated with a persistent dry cough in a significant percentage of such patients. The present study was designed to assess the contribution of polymorphisms as a genetic marker of ACE-inhibitor-related cough in a Japanese hypertensive population. Genotyping was carried out in 190 patients, 70 with cough and 120 without cough, who had been treated with ACE inhibitors. Polymorphisms of ACE insertion/deletion (I/D), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (1166A/C), type 2 receptor (3123C/A), and bradykinin B2 receptor (-58T/C, exon 1, I/D), were analyzed in these subjects. The TT genotype and T allele of bradykinin B2 receptor (-58T/C) were identified at a significantly higher frequency in the cough (+) patients than in the cough (-) patients. This difference was even more pronounced in women. However, there was no significant relationship between polymorphisms of ACE, angiotensin II receptors, or bradykinin B2 receptor exon 1, and occurrence of ACE-inhibitor-related cough. The transcriptional activity of the bradykinin B2 receptor promoter is involved in the occurrence of cough, and this new marker may provide a valuable tool to detect patients at risk of developing this side effect of ACE inhibitors. In conclusion, Susceptibility to develop cough is associated with a genetic variant of the bradykinin B2 receptor promoter; thus, it may be possible to identify those patients who will develop this adverse reaction to ACE inhibitors in advance.", 
    "265": "Obesity-associated hypertension is a common disease that involves a complex pathogenesis. Failure to control hypertension (HTN) in obese subjects provides a great threat to their renal and cardiovascular functions. The treatment of obesity-associated HTN is often difficult, and requires nonpharmacological and/or pharmacological approaches. Weight reduction is the cornerstone of the therapies of obesity-HTN, as it reverses the multiple components of its pathogenesis. When weight loss cannot be sustained or fails, pharmacological means should then be used. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are the drug of choice: they can reduce blood pressure, protect the kidney and heart, and improve the metabolic abnormalities in obese subjects. Angiotensin-2 type-1 receptor blockers have a renoprotective benefit similar to ACEI, and they provide an important alternative to the use of ACEI. Diuretics are very effective in African-American obese hypertensives, but small doses should be used to avoid adverse effects on metabolic profiles. Long-acting calcium channel blockers are also effective and have the advantage of no adverse metabolic effects. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may provide additional renal and cardiovascular protective effects. The beta-adrenergic receptor blockers can cause further weight gain and metabolic abnormalities in obese subjects; therefore, careful monitoring is needed. There are few clinical data that support the efficacy and benefit of centrally acting alpha-2 agonists and alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists in the treatment of obesity-HTN.", 
    "266": "Little is known about baroreflex control of renal nerve sympathetic activity (RSNA) or the effect of angiotensin II (ANG II) on the baroreflex in diabetes. We examined baroreflex control of RSNA and heart rate (HR) in conscious, chronically instrumented rats 2 wk after citrate vehicle (normal) or 55 mg/kg iv streptozotocin (diabetic) before and after losartan (5 mg/kg iv) or enalapril (2.5 mg/kg iv). Resting HR and RSNA were lower in diabetic versus normal rats. The range of baroreflex control of HR and the gain of baroreflex-mediated bradycardia were impaired in diabetic rats. Maximum gain was unchanged. The baroreflex control of RSNA was reset to lower pressures in the diabetic rats but remained otherwise unchanged. Losartan decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and increased HR and RSNA in both groups but had no influence on the baroreflex. Enalapril decreased MAP only in normal rats, yet the increase in HR and RSNA was similar in both groups. Thus in diabetic rats enalapril produced a pressure-independent increase in HR and RSNA. Enalapril exerted no effect on the baroreflex control of HR or RSNA in either group. These data indicate that in conscious rats resting RSNA is lower but baroreflex control of RSNA is preserved after 2 wk of diabetes. At this time, the baroreflex control of HR is already impaired and blockade of endogenous ANG II does not improve this dysfunction.", 
    "267": "Time-sequential responses to endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were studied in the subendocardial arterioles (Endo) of canine renovascular hypertension (HT) compared with subepicardial arterioles (Epi; both <120 microm) by charge-coupled device intravital microscope. Vascular responses to acetylcholine, papaverine, and cilazaprilat were compared between normotensive (NT) and HT dogs [4 wk and 12 wk of HT (4wHT and 12wHT)]. The acetylcholine-induced vasodilation of Endo in both 4wHT and 12wHT was smaller than that of NT (both P < 0.01 vs. 4wHT and 12wHT), and that of Epi was smaller than that of NT only in 12wHT (P < 0.05). The papaverine-induced vasodilation of Endo, but not Epi, was impaired only in 12wHT (both P < 0.01 vs. NT and 4wHT). Vasodilation by cilazaprilat remained unchanged at 4wHT and 12wHT in both Epi and Endo. In conclusion, at the early stage, the endothelium-dependent response of Endo was impaired, whereas at the later stage, the endothelium-dependent and -independent responses of Endo and the endothelium-dependent response of Epi were impaired. However, the vasodilatory responses to the ACE inhibitor were maintained in both Endo and Epi of HT.", 
    "268": "The Plasma level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been identified as a major risk factor for restenosis after coronary stent implantation in selected patients; ACE inhibition may therefore contribute to prevent its occurrence. The effect of oral ACE inhibition at conventional doses was analyzed retrospectively in a series of 897 patients with ischemia who received >or=1 coronary stent on 998 lesions and underwent angiographic follow-up; no exclusion criteria were introduced in this analysis. The restenosis rate in 282 patients (31.4%) taking ACE inhibitors was 36.6% compared with 22.9% in 615 non-ACE-inhibited patients (p = 0.00001, odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45 to 2.59), and the late loss in minimum lumen diameter was 1.25 +/- 0.8 versus 0.96 +/- 0.8 mm, respectively (p = 0.0001). During univariate analysis, a negative effect of the drug on restenosis was observed in all subgroups of patients (i.e., hypertensives, diabetics, women, and patients with previous myocardial infarction). Similar effects were observed independently of the ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism. During multivariate analysis, ACE inhibition was confirmed as an independent risk factor for restenosis (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.51, p = 0.0001). Other predictors were the implantation of multiple stents (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.64, p <0.0001), diabetes (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.41, p <0.0001), and vessel reference diameter before angioplasty (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.69, p <0.0001). Although unexplained and apparently contradictory, our data suggest that the use of conventional oral doses of ACE inhibitors in a \"real-world\" population who underwent coronary stent implantation increases the incidence of in-stent restenosis. Such a finding does not negate the known clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors, but it may deserve attention when a patient treated with ACE inhibitors becomes a candidate for stent implantation.", 
    "269": "Until the 1990s, chronic radiation-induced normal-tissue injury was viewed as being due solely to the delayed mitotic death of parenchymal or vascular cells; these injuries were held to be inevitable, progressive, and untreatable. It is now clear that parenchymal and vascular cells are active participants in the response to radiation injury rather than passive observers dying as they attempt to divide. This offers fundamentally new approaches to radiation injury because it allows for the possibility of pharmacological interventions directed at modulating steps in the cascade of events leading to expression of injury. Such interventions would be relevant to both cancer patients and victims of radiation accidents. Prophylaxis and treatment of chronic radiation injuries have been experimentally shown in multiple organ systems (eg, lung, kidney, soft tissue) and with fundamentally different pharmacological agents (eg, corticosteroids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, pentoxifylline, superoxide dismutase). For the most part, this has been achieved using clinically relevant radiation and drug schedules and with agents that have already been approved for human use. Unfortunately, assessment of the utility of these agents for clinical use has been minimal, and there are no established mechanisms for any of the experimental or clinical successes. Clinical development of pharmacological approaches to modification of chronic radiation injuries could lead to significant improvement in survival and quality of life for radiotherapy patients and for victims of radiation accidents or nuclear terrorism.", 
    "270": "Recent studies have proposed a link between impaired nephrogenesis, decreased activity of the renin-angiotensin system and the onset of hypertension in rats exposed in the uterus to a maternal low-protein diet. However, there is no detailed information about renal function in this model; hence the aim of the present study was to assess renal function in young (4-week-old) rats exposed in the uterus to a maternal low-protein diet. Pregnant Wistar rats were fed isocalorific diets containing either 18% (normal protein; offspring denoted NP rats) or 9% (low protein; offspring denoted LP rats) (w/w) protein from conception until birth. At 4 weeks of age, male offspring were anaesthetized and prepared for the study of renal function, during which animals received saline alone, a bolus of enalapril (5 mg.kg(-1)) or a bolus of enalapril followed by an infusion of angiotensin II (30 ng.min(-1).kg(-1)). Under control conditions, renal haemodynamic and tubular function did not differ. However, when challenged with angiotensin II, LP rats responded with a greater decrease in glomerular filtration rate than did NP rats [NP, 2.0+/-0.2 ml.min(-1).g(-1) kidney weight ( n =9); LP, 1.0+/-0.2 ml.min(-1).g(-1) kidney weight ( n =5); P <0.05]. Renal electrolyte excretion did not differ. LP rats had significantly fewer glomeruli than NP rats ( P <0.01). Renal angiotensin II AT(1) receptor expression was increased ( P <0.01) by 24% in LP rats. It is concluded that blood pressure may be elevated in LP rats in order to maintain glomerular filtration rate against a background of fewer nephrons. Increased AT(1) receptor expression, which may arise as a result of the direct effect of protein restriction or in response to the reported decrease in renal tissue angiotensin II concentration, could also contribute to the elevated blood pressure of this model.", 
    "271": "Apoptosis plays a role in the regulation of heart mass and architecture, and might contribute to the cardiac remodelling seen in renovascular hypertension. It is not known whether the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or calcium channel blockade on cardiac remodelling are linked to the modulation of apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we established four groups of rats: (i) sham-operated controls, (ii) a group that underwent the two-kidney/one-clip (2K1C) procedure, (iii) a group with 2K1C treated for 12 weeks with quinapril (6 mg x day(-1) x kg(-1)), and (iv) a group with 2K1C treated for 12 weeks with diltiazem (24 mg x day(-1) x kg(-1)). Treatment started 2 weeks after clipping. Systolic blood pressure was reduced to a similar extent by quinapril and diltiazem (2K1C, 223+/-19 mmHg; 2K1C+quinapril, 149+/-15 mmHg; 2K1C+diltiazem, 160+/-40 mmHg; both P <0.01 compared with 2K1C alone). Left ventricular weight, interstitial fibrosis and perivascular fibrosis were reduced significantly by both drugs. The apoptotic index (apoptotic cells/total cell number) was increased 21.6-fold (P <0.01) after quinapril treatment as compared with the 2K1C group, but was not affected by calcium channel blockade. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that ACE inhibition, in contrast with calcium channel blockade, may cause regression of cardiac hypertrophy/remodelling in 2K1C renovascular hypertensive rats through enhanced apoptosis.", 
    "272": "This study was carried out to assess whether with a similar degree of blood pressure reduction, Lisinopril compares favorably or otherwise with lacidipine in respect of effects on urinary albumin excretion and renal function as assessed by creatinine clearance, plasma creatinine, urea and electrolytes. Thirty hypertensive diabetic nephropathy patients with moderate hypertension were studied. After a 2-week washout period, they were allocated into two groups matched at baseline for age, sex, weight, blood pressure, and urinary albumin excretion rate as well as creatinine clearance. There were 8 males and 7 females in each group. One group received lisinopril (with furosemide if needed to control BP) and the other group received lacidipine. Staged increases in doses of antihypertensives were used until BP was controlled or maximum dose of 40 mg/day lisinopril or 8 mg/day lacidipine was reached. Furosemide was added to lisinopril if BP was not controlled at 40 mg/day. These medications were given for 12 weeks at the end of which measurements done at baseline were repeated. Comparison of baseline and end of study values of these parameters within the groups and between the two groups were made. Lisinopril group and lacidipine group achieved similar and highly significant reduction in blood pressure levels P < 0.001. There was reduction in urinary albumin excretion rate in both groups but this only reached statistical significance in the lisinopril group [480] [269] mg/day vs. 315 [202] mg/day P < 0.05] while for the lacidipine group it was not significant [491] [257] mg/day vs. 335 [182] mg/day P > 0.05]. However, comparison of albumin excretion rate between both groups at baseline and at end of the study did not show any significant difference, P > 0.1. With both drugs there is a tendency for creatinine clearance to increase and plasma creatinine to drop while plasma potassium tended to rise more with lisinopril than lacidipine but differences within and between both groups, did not reach statistical significance P > 0.05. In conclusion, blood pressure reduction was comparable in both drugs; both drugs reduced albuminuria but lisinopril appeared superior. Treatment with both drugs tended to increase creatinine clearance but both had no significant effects on blood sugar.", 
    "273": "Mild to moderate hypertension still remains poorly controlled. This relates to multiple factors including low antihypertensive efficacy of single drug therapies, reluctance of primary care physicians to modify or titrate initially chosen therapy to obtain target blood pressure and poor compliance with medication. Evidence discussed in the present paper points to superior control of blood pressure by combinations of low doses of two drugs compared with monotherapy in regular doses. This superior effectiveness of combined therapy relates to a better antihypertensive efficacy and higher response rates in the low range of doses as the result of complementary mechanisms of antihypertensive effects. It is associated with better tolerance as the result of a lower rate of side effects in the low range of dosing, improved compliance from better tolerance and simple drug regimen, and lower cost. Increased use of fixed, low dose combination therapies can be expected to result in better control of arterial hypertension in the population. Given the evidence for superior antihypertensive efficacy and better tolerability, and the absence of harm from fixed, low dose drug combinations per se, this alternative deserves more consideration in the guidelines of major hypertension organizations.",

Only felodipine-ER significantly increased supine and standing plasma noradrenaline by more than 50% similarly after six, 18, and 30 weeks of treatment. In BP responders (decrease in systolic BP 10 mmHg or greater), enalapril and nifedipine-GITS caused clear decreases in LV mass by 12 to 16 g/m2, whereas felodipine-ER was less effective (decrease by only 6 g/m2, P<0.01 versus enalapril).",

The response to drugs that work relatively nonspecifically (diuretics, calcium blockers) was relatively consistent over 24 h.

The rats treated with L-NAME showed mild and scarce renal lesions, which were prevented by OMA treatment and the L-NAME + DOCA group showed proteinuria and hyaline arteriopathy, which were markedly attenuated in the L-NAME + DOCA + OMA group. Plasma urea and creatinine were significantly increased in the L-NAME + DOCA group, whereas these variables were not significantly greater in the L-NAME + DOCA + OMA group versus controls. The L-NAME + DOCA group showed relative renal and cardiac hypertrophy that was not observed in the L-NAME + DOCA + OMA group.",

Our results also show that OMA attenuates the increased BP and the renal injury in L-NAME hypertensive rats treated with DOCA. Assuming that this is a low-renin model of hypertension, the protective effect of OMA may be due to an increase in vasodilator peptides produced by both ACE and NEP inhibition.", 
    "292": "A testis-specific isoform of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been identified in a number of mammalian species. The purpose of this study was to characterize the activity of ACE in equine spermatozoa, seminal plasma, and testis. Activity of ACE was determined in seminal plasma, ejaculated and epididymal spermatozoa from mature stallions as well as from pre- and postpubertal testis. The effect of addition of angiotensin II on equine sperm motility was also evaluated. The activity of ACE in detergent extracted sperm plasma membrane was approximately 13-fold higher than that detected in seminal plasma (93.7 mU/mg versus 7.0 mU/mg protein, respectively). Activity of ACE in equine testis was significantly higher in postpubertal than in prepubertal males (3.0 mU/mg versus 0.4 mU/mg protein, respectively), and ACE activity was reduced (P<0.001) in a dose-dependent fashion by the addition of captopril. The effect of angiotensin II on sperm motility was evaluated by computer-assisted semen analysis in sperm incubated with angiotensin II (0, 1, 10, 100 nM) at 38.5 degrees C. There was no significant effect of angiotensin II on the percent motile sperm; however, there was a significant main effect of angiotensin II (P<0.01) on the kinematic parameters beat cross frequency (BCF), average path velocity (VAP), and curvilinear velocity (VCL), respectively. In addition, there were significant stallionxconcentration interactions for amplitude lateral movement (ALH), BCF, linearity (LIN), straightness (STR), and VCL. This study demonstrates that ACE activity is present in sperm membrane from ejaculated and epididymal spermatozoa and in postpubertal testis. Further studies are required to determine the role of this testis-specific enzyme.", 
    "293": "Antihypertensive agents are proven to reduce the cardiovascular risk of stroke, coronary heart disease and cardiac failure. The ideal antihypertensive agent should control all grades of hypertension and have a placebo-like side effect profile. Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists are a relatively new class of antihypertensive agent that block AII Type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, and reduce the pressor effects of AII in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure. However, AII receptor blockers differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, a side effect which may be related to bradykinin or other mediators such as substance P. Within the class of AII blockers, eprosartan differs from other currently available agents in terms of chemical structure, as it is a non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole, non-peptide antagonist with a dual pharmacological mode of action. Eprosartan acts at vascular AT(1) receptors (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic AT(1) receptors, where it inhibits sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Its lack of metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes confers a low potential for metabolic drug interactions and may be of importance when treating elderly patients and those on multiple drugs. In clinical trials, eprosartan has been demonstrated to be at least as effective in reducing blood pressure as the ACE inhibitor enalapril, and has significantly lower side effects. Eprosartan is safe, effective and well-tolerated in long-term treatment, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide.",

After dipyridamole infusion, CBF increased 2- to 3-fold in patients and 3- to 4-fold in control subjects. The increase and maximal CBF were significantly higher in control subjects than in patients. During ACE-inhibitor infusion, which had no influence on resting CBF in patients or control subjects (n = 5), CPT increased CBF by 14% in the NIDDM group. After dipyridamole, CBF increased 3- to 4-fold in both groups. The increase in CBF and maximal CBF in the 2 groups were not different during ACE-inhibitor infusion.", 
    "297": "In these NIDDM patients without evidence of epicardial coronary disease, endothelial dysfunction is strongly suggested by an impaired increase in CBF both to dipyridamole and to CPT. This dysfunction was reversed by infusion of an ACE inhibitor. Although ACE inhibition during CPT did induce significant increases in CBF in the patients, the changes during ACE inhibition were small compared with the dipyridamole response, and the absence of CBF increase during CPT in 3 of the 10 control subjects further limits the value of CPT for the study of coronary endothelial dysfunction.",

In protocol 1, plasma level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and renal function were assessed before and after intravenous infusion of vitamin C or placebo in 8 patients with moderate congestive heart failure (CHF) treated with enalapril. In protocol 2, a randomized crossover study was performed in patients with moderate CHF treated with either an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) (n = 10) or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan) (n = 9) and in asymptomatic patients with impaired left ventricular function treated with enalapril (n = 8).

IS-5-MN significantly reduced the serum concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (mean 20.0 pmol/L, 95% CI 7.7-32.3, P =.002), whereas the placebo did not (P =.041 for the difference between the groups). The proportion of patients taking diuretics was significantly reduced in the IS-5-MN group, from 30 of 44 to 20 of 44 (P =.02), but not with placebo, which remained at 27 of 43 (P = 1.0, with P =.048 for the difference between the regimens).",

    "314": "Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are valuable therapeutic agents for a wide range of clinical conditions. Increasingly, consideration is being given to the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor (AR) antagonists to obtain more complete inhibition of the RAS than can be achieved by either agent alone. Beta-blockers also inhibit the RAS by inhibiting renin secretion. Whereas the combination of an ACE inhibitor and AR antagonist represents dual RAS inhibition, the combination of both of these agents with beta-blocker therapy represents triple RAS inhibition. Animal studies indicate that complete blockade of the RAS produces adverse effects. Moreover, post-hoc analysis of the recent Valsartan Heart Failure Trial study suggests that the combination of ACE inhibitor and AR antagonist therapies may have an adverse effect in heart failure when combined with beta-blocker therapy. There is therefore a need for caution in the combination of ACE inhibition and AR antagonism, particularly in patients receiving beta-blockers, until the impact of this strategy is evaluated.", 
    "315": "Immunosuppressant-induced nephrotoxicity contributes to kidney graft loss in the long-term as one of the non-immunologic factors. We previously reported that correction of cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced hypomagnesemia reduced chronic CsA nephrotoxicity. This study was conducted to elucidate the mechanism of the beneficial effects of magnesium (Mg) on CsA nephrotoxicity and examine the role of the renin-angiotensin system in this mechanism. We particularly focused on CsA-induced interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration. CsA (15 mg/kg/day, s.c.) was administered daily to rats maintained on low sodium diets for 7, 14 and 28 days. The inhibitory effects of Mg supplementation and those of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) were compared for renal function, renal histology, mononuclear cell infiltration and gene expression profile. CsA lowered creatinine clearance and developed characteristic tubulointerstitial fibrosis that were mostly evident at day 28. CsA-induced impairment of renal function was ameliorated by Mg supplementation but not by ACEI. Monocyte/macrophage infiltration preceded the renal fibrosis and increased progressively with the duration of CsA administration. CsA markedly upregulated the expression of chemoattractant proteins, osteopontin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, concomitantly. These changes were markedly attenuated by Mg but only slightly by ACEI. CsA also promoted expression of fibrogenic molecules and extracellular matrices that were markedly attenuated by Mg but only slightly by ACEI. Similarly, CsA-induced tubulointestitial fibrosis was almost completely abolished by Mg supplementation but only partially attenuated by ACEI. These results suggested that Mg supplementation abolished CsA-induced precedent inflammatory cell influx possibly via inhibition of expression of chemoattractants and consequently suppressed tubulointerstitial fibrosis. In this beneficial mechanism, factors independent of renin-angiotensin system seem to be mainly involved.", 
    "316": "It has been reported that continuous ACE inhibitor therapy does not necessarily produce a maintained decrease in plasma aldosterone levels, which may remain high or increase eventually during long-term use (aldosterone escape). We have examined the role of aldosterone escape in 45 patients with type 2 diabetes and early nephropathy treated with an ACE inhibitor for 40 weeks. With treatment, there was a 40% reduction in average urinary albumin excretion, although urinary albumin excretion in patients with aldosterone escape (18 patients) was significantly higher than that in patients without escape (27 patients). In the 18 patients with escape, spironolactone (25 mg/d) was added to ACE inhibitor treatment in 13. After a 24-week study period, urinary albumin excretion and left ventricular mass index were significantly reduced without blood pressure change. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that aldosterone escape is observed in 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes with early nephropathy despite the use of ACE inhibitors. Our study suggests the possibility that aldosterone blockade may represent optimal therapy for patients with early diabetic nephropathy who show aldosterone escape during ACE inhibitor treatment and who no longer show maximal antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibition. Additional, larger, prospectively randomized, double-blind studies will be needed before adaptation of this strategy.", 
    "317": "We assessed the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) achieved with 2 angiotensin (Ang) antagonists given either alone at different doses or with an ACE inhibitor. First, 20 normotensive subjects were randomly assigned to 100 mg OD losartan (LOS) or 80 mg OD telmisartan (TEL) for 1 week; during another week, the same doses of LOS and TEL were combined with 20 mg OD lisinopril. Then, 10 subjects were randomly assigned to 200 mg OD LOS and 160 mg OD TEL for 1 week and 100 mg BID LOS and 80 mg BID TEL during the second week. Blockade of the RAS was evaluated with the inhibition of the pressor effect of exogenous Ang I, an ex vivo receptor assay, and the changes in plasma Ang II. Trough blood pressure response to Ang I was blocked by 35+/-16% (mean+/-SD) with 100 mg OD LOS and by 36+/-13% with 80 mg OD TEL. When combined with lisinopril, blockade was 76+/-7% with LOS and 79+/-9% with TEL. With 200 mg OD LOS, trough blockade was 54+/-14%, but with 100 mg BID it increased to 77+/-8% (P<0.01). Telmisartan (160 mg OD and 80 mg BID) produced a comparable effect. Thus, at their maximal recommended doses, neither LOS nor TEL blocks the RAS for 24 hours; hence, the addition of an ACE inhibitor provides an additional blockade. A 24-hour blockade can be achieved with an angiotensin antagonist alone, provided higher doses or a BID regimen is used.",

    "323": "Summary. Arteriosclerotic disease develops over the course of several decades. Currently, a number of therapies are at hand to effectively stop this process and avoid complications of arteriosclerosis. Among the non-pharmacologic options, a balanced diet and physical activity predominate. A modern dietary plan offers a variety of tasty servings rich in fresh fruit and vegetables, cereals, fish, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. The value of regular physical activity is demonstrated by the finding that an increase in exercise capacity (\"cardiorespiratory fitness\") by only one metabolic equivalent already reduces cardiovascular risk by 20-25 %. Regarding pharmacologic therapy, convincing data are available for cholesterol synthase inhibitors (\"statins\"), some substances which influence the renin-angiotensin system (such as ramipril), and platelet aggregation inhibitors. Statins produce a 20 to 30 % reduction of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. In patients with increased cardiovascular risk, the beneficial action of statins is also evident in subjects with low baseline cholesterol values. Apart from the cholesterol-lowering effects, anti-inflammatory and other vasoprotective mechanisms are involved. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril has demonstrated that even independent of blood-pressure lowering, cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke) are substantially reduced in high-risk patients. The effect is in the same order as that of statins. In patients with left-ventricular hypertrophy, the angiotensin-receptor antagonist losartan produces a notable reduction in stroke, independent of its blood-pressure lowering action. Finally, the platelet aggregation inhibitors aspirin and clopidogrel have proven benefit in secondary prevention and, in the case of aspirin, also in primary prevention in cardiovascular high-risk patients. The anti-arteriosclerotic properties of other substances are actively investigated, including calcium channel blockers, betablockers, and novel drug classes. From the medical point of view, a broader use of the well-proven and effective therapies of arteriosclerosis and its complications is clearly warranted.",

Unstressed eNOS-/- hearts in basal conditions exhibit a normal inotropic and lusitropic function, with either decreased or unchanged heart rate. Under stimulation with catecholamines, eNOS-/- mice predominantly show a potentiation in their beta-adrenergic inotropic and lusitropic responsiveness. A similar phenotype is observed in beta 3-adrenoceptor deficient mice, pointing to a key role of this receptor subtype for eNOS coupling. The effect of eNOS on the muscarinic cholinergic modulation of cardiac function probably operates in conjunction with other NO-independent mechanisms, the persistence of which may explain the apparent dispensability of this isoform for the effect of acetylcholine in some eNOS-/- mouse strains. eNOS-/- hearts submitted to short term ischaemia-reperfusion exhibit variable alterations in systolic and diastolic function and infarct size, while those submitted to myocardial infarction present a worsened ventricular remodelling, increased 1 month mortality and loss of benefit from ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist therapy. Although non-conditional eNOS gene deletion may engender phenotypic adaptations (e.g. ventricular hypertrophy resulting from chronic hypertension, or upregulation of the other NOS isoforms) potentially confounding the interpretation of comparative studies, the use of eNOS-/- mice has undoubtedly advanced (and will probably continue to improve) our understanding of the complex role of eNOS (in conjunction with the other NOSs) in the regulation of cardiac function.

    "343": "Aging is accompanied by a progressive and irreversible non-enzymatic modification of protein by carbohydrates, eventually yielding the advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Age generation (Maillard reaction) is markedly augmented in diabetes with sustained hyperglycemia but also in normoglycemic uremia and atherosclerosis. Recent studies have brought new insights into broad derangements in non-enzymatic biochemistry involving not only carbohydrates but also lipids, present in diabetes, uremia, and atherosclerosis. The latter have in common increased levels of reactive carbonyl compounds (RCOs) with attendant protein modifications (\"carbonyl stress\"). Carbonyl stress might be derived from 1) hyperglycemia (lipemia), 2) oxidative stress, and/or 3) impaired detoxification of RCOs. Manipulation of carbonyl stress in diabetes, uremia and atherosclerosis opens new therapeutic approaches including redox modulation, RCO detoxification, and carbonyl stress inhibition. The first generation of carbonyl stress inhibitors such as aminoguanidine trap RCOs with its hydrazine group. Unfortunately, aminoguanidine (AG) traps pyridoxal as well as noxious RCOs, so that its long-term administration in animals results in vitamin B6 deficiency and neurotoxicity. Fortunately, newer compounds devoid of such side effects, have opened exciting prospects. Widely used hypotensive agents, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor antagonist, but not calcium blockers, prove more effective than AG in attenuating the production of AGEs. Unlike AG, they do not act as RCO trapping agents, but impact upon the production of RCO precursors by scavenging a variety of radicals and altering oxidative stress, a mechanism similar to that involved in the inhibitory action of nitric oxide on AGE formation. These results provide a new framework to assess families of compounds according to their mechanisms of action.",

The treatments efficiently reduced the cardiomyocyte VWNV > 45%, confirming efficient action of both spironolactone monotherapy at moderate and high dose and spironolactone combined with enalapril or verapamil. However, the high dose of spironolactone, and spironolactone plus enalapril or verapamil showed no significant differences in cardiomyocyte VWNV. Correlation between VWNV and BP (13th week) suggested that BP degree influences cardiomyocyte VWNV.",

However, study of these lesions is compromised by the lack of a comparable diabetic rodent model. Because the vasoactive and angiogenic agent, angiotensin II, is involved in diabetic microvascular disease, we aimed to determine whether endothelial cell proliferation could be induced in the retinae and irides of hypertensive transgenic (mRen-2)27 rats that display an enhanced extra-renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including the eye. Six-week-old Ren-2, spontaneously hypertensive, and Sprague-Dawley rats received either streptozotocin or control vehicle and were studied for 36 weeks. Additional nondiabetic and diabetic Ren-2 rats were treated throughout with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (LIS) (10 mg/kg/day in drinking water). Endothelial cell proliferation was only observed in retinae and irides of diabetic Ren-2 rats and was reduced with LIS. In diabetic Ren-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGFR-2 mRNA were increased in retinae and irides and reduced with LIS. Diabetes activated ocular renin in Ren-2 but not Sprague-Dawley rats. The diabetic Ren-2 rat is a model of intraocular endothelial cell proliferation that can be attenuated by RAS blockade via VEGF-dependent pathways. RAS blockade is a potential treatment for vision-threatening diabetic microvascular complications.",

Members of the metallo-enzyme class are now found in many pathogenic bacteria and are thus becoming of major clinical importance. The structures of the Zn-beta-lactamase from Fluoribacter gormanii (FEZ-1) in the native and in the complex form are reported here. FEZ-1 is a monomeric enzyme, which possesses two zinc-binding sites. These structures are discussed in comparison with those of the tetrameric L1 enzyme produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. From this analysis, amino acids involved in the oligomerization of L1 are clearly identified. Despite the similarity in fold, the active site of FEZ-1 was found to be significantly different. Two residues, which were previously implicated in function, are not present in L1 or in FEZ-1. The broad-spectrum substrate profile of Zn-beta-lactamases arises from the rather wide active-site cleft, where various beta-lactam compounds can be accommodated.",

Therapies such as cholesterol-lowering medications and newer antihypertensive agents appear to complement traditional antithrombotic drugs and surgical procedures. Of particular interest is the use of the newer angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which appear to have an effect on stabilizing the vascular endothelium. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) reduction in hypertension study provides additional data to support the use of the ACE inhibitors to lower the risk of stroke among patients with hypertension and vascular diseases.",

Both of these classes of agents have a primary mechanism of action of reducing the level of the respective risk factor. They also have mechanisms of action that may confer benefits beyond what is believed to be the primary action of the agent. This has led to speculation that statins reduce stroke risk by means beyond cholesterol lowering, and ACE inhibitors reduce stroke risk by means beyond blood pressure lowering. We review the mounting evidence that suggests that statins and ACE inhibitors have so-called pleiotropic effects that may lead to stroke prevention.",

Patients with an LVEF > 45% were significantly older, more often female and presented a significantly higher prevalence of a hypertensive etiology, obesity and atrial fibrillation. The severity of the clinical picture, as indicated by a lower prevalence of NYHA class III-IV (17.2 vs 35.6%, p = 0.001) and a third heart sound (14.8 vs 33.5%, p = 0.001), was less in patients with an LVEF > 45%. The therapeutic approach differed significantly, with a larger use of calcium antagonists and beta-blockers in patients with an LVEF > 45%, while ACE-inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin were more often prescribed to those with an impaired LVEF. The 1-year mortality and morbidity (all cause and congestive heart failure worsening hospitalizations) were significantly lower in patients with a preserved left ventricular systolic function compared to those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (8.9 vs 18.8% for mortality, p = 0.001, and 8.3 vs 16.5% for hospital readmissions due to worsening congestive heart failure, p = 0.001, respectively).",

    "356": "Oxidative stress plays an important role in causing progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). We examined the influence of add-on ANG II receptor blockade administered as losartan (50 mg/day for 1 mo) on oxidative stress and proinflammatory state of the kidney in patients with CKD. All subjects were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus other antihypertensive agents. Oxidative stress to lipids and proteins was measured by an HPLC assay for malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl concentration, respectively. Urinary inflammation was measured by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) excretion rate. The etiology of CKD was type 2 diabetes mellitus in 12 and glomerulonephritis in 4 patients. There was no change in proteinuria or 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) with add-on ANG II receptor blockade with losartan therapy. Before losartan therapy, urinary protein and albumin oxidation were 99 and 71% higher, respectively, compared with in plasma (P < 0.05). There was a 35% reduction in urinary oxidized albumin with add-on losartan therapy (P = 0.036). Urinary and plasma MDA were elevated compared with age-matched controls. Urinary MDA was significantly reduced from 4.75 +/- 3.23 to 3.39 +/- 2.17 micromol/g creatinine with add-on losartan therapy. However, plasma MDA or oxidized proteins did not change in response to additional ANG II blockade. A good correlation was seen between the change in urinary oxidized albumin and MCP-1 levels (r = 0.61, P = 0.012). These data demonstrate that oxidative damage to urinary protein and lipids can be reduced with additional ANG II receptor blockade, independently of reductions in proteinuria or BP. Urinary measurements of markers of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins appear to be more sensitive than plasma measurements in patients with CKD. The significant association of the change in urinary MCP-1 with a reduction in oxidative stress supports the role of the redox state in the kidney with renal fibrosis and progressive kidney damage.", 
    "357": "Recent progress in molecular biological research has revealed that many types of transporters are expressed in the liver. Such xenobiotic transporters have a wide range of substrate specificity, which allows them to act as a barrier to protect the body from potentially harmful xenobiotics. Most of them mediate active transport of the substrates, leading to concentrative uptake and excretion into the hepatocytes and bile. Transport properties such as these may play a role in the toxicity of certain types of substrates. For example, anticancer agents such as methotrexate and irinotecan are efficiently excreted into the bile and such excretion has been suggested to account for their toxic gastrointestinal side-effects. A similar hypothesis has also been proposed for NSAIDs. Considering their tissue-specific expression, these transporters also appear to be a promising target for the delivery of small molecules, while simultaneously minimizing their side-effects. For example, transporters involved in the oral absorption, hepatic uptake, and biliary excretion of pravastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, ensure its enterohepatic circulation giving it an important pharmacokinetic advantage since its pharmacological target is the liver. Of the major ACE inhibitors currently available, temocaprilat is a substrate of hepatic transporters. Since the major elimination route for other ACE inhibitors is via urinary excretion, their plasma concentrations exhibit a high degree of inter-patient variability over a wide range of renal function whereas the concentrations of temocaprilat exhibit a much lower degree of inter-patient variability due to its elimination into the bile. Thus, the hepatobiliary transporters are involved in some aspects of toxicology and, therefore, a rational strategy for regulating the recognition by such transporters may be required for optimum drug design. This presentation will discuss the possible role of hepatic transporters from a toxicological point of view.", 
    "358": "Collagen types I and III (Col I and Col III) are the major fibrillar collagens produced by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the adult heart. Fibrillar collagen of the heart provides the structural scaffolding for cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels and imparts cardiac tissue with physical properties that include stiffness and resistance to deformation. In addition, fibrillar collagen may also act as a link between contractile element of adjacent cardiomyocytes and as a conduit of information that is necessary for cell function. As in other organs, collagen turnover of normal adult heart results from the equilibrium between the synthesis and degradation of Col I and Col III. A number of factors have been described that may alter the balance in favor of either the synthesis (e.g., angiotensin II-ANG II-) or the degradation. Predominance of synthesis over degradation leads to increased Col I and Col III deposition or fibrosis that accompanies cardiac diseases such as hypertensive heart disease. Fibrosis alters myocardial structure and function and adversely afects the clinical outcome of hypertensive patients. Various lines of evidence suggest that besides hypertension, systemically and/or locally produced ANG II may participate in the development of hypertensive myocardial fibrosis via activation of ANG II type 1 receptors (AT(1)R). The potential clinical relevance of this possibility is linked to the ability of antihypertensive drugs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and AT(1)R antagonists (ARAs) to reverse myocardial fibrosis beyond their antihypertensive efficacy.", 
    "359": "The present study was carried out to investigate whether estrogen modulates the drinking response induced by activation of angiotensinergic neural pathways from the subfornical organ (SFO) to the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Microinjection of angiotensin II (ANG II, 10(-10) M, 0.2 microl) into the SFO elicited drinking in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats that were treated with either propylene glycol (PG) vehicle or estrogen benzoate (EB). The amount of water intake induced by the ANG II injection was significantly greater in the PG-treated than in the EB-treated animals. In both groups of female rats, previous injections of saralasin (Sar, 10(-10) M, 0.2 microl), a specific ANG II antagonist, into the MnPO resulted in the significant attenuation of the drinking response to ANG II, showing that the ANG II-induced drinking response may be mediated in part by the angiotensinergic SFO projections to the MnPO. Injections of ANG II (10(-10) M, 0.2 microl) into the MnPO caused drinking in both groups, while no significant difference was found between the groups in the amount of water intake. These results suggest that increases in the circulating level of estrogen may attenuate the drinking response induced by ANG II activation of the SFO projections to the MnPO.", 
    "360": "Our previous studies have shown that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and angiotensin II (Ang II) influence each other's action in endothelial cells. This study was designed to examine the regulation by ox-LDL of the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). In addition, we studied the effect of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin on this interaction.", 
    "361": "Cultured HCAECs were incubated with ox-LDL (10-80 microg/ml) for 1-24 h. Ox-LDL increased the expression of ACE in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. The upregulation of ACE expression in response to ox-LDL was mediated by its endothelial receptor LOX-1, since pretreatment of HCAECs with a blocking antibody to LOX-1 prevented the expression of ACE (P<0.01). Native-LDL had no significant effect on ACE expression. In this process, ox-LDL-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK p42/44) played an important role, since pretreatment of HCAECs with the MAPK p42/44 inhibitor (PD98059, 10 microM) inhibited MAPK activation and subsequently attenuated the expression of ACE (P<0.01 vs. ox-LDL alone). In other experiments, we pretreated HCAECs with simvastatin (10 microM) and then exposed the cells to ox-LDL. Simvastatin markedly attenuated ox-LDL-induced MAPK activation, and concurrently reduced ACE expression (P<0.01 vs. ox-LDL alone).", 
    "362": "Our observations provide direct evidence that ox-LDL via LOX-1 activation induces ACE gene expression in HCAECs, and MAPK activation plays a signal transduction role in this process. Simvastatin, which inhibits MAPK activation, also blocks ox-LDL-mediated upregulation of ACE.",

No changes were observed in atrial gene expression or plasma concentration of ANF or BNP. A significant correlation was found between LVW/BW and LV renin mRNA and LV ACE activity in rats with LV hypertrophy. LV beta-MHC mRNA levels were significantly increased in the LV of rats with or without LV hypertrophy at both 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.", 
    "366": "It is concluded that pressure overload per se does not promote NP or cardiac renin-angiotensin system gene expression while increased beta-MHC expression is a marker of LV pressure overload even in the absence of LV hypertrophy.

Treatment of adeno-PKC-betaII infected cardiomyocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in an 8-fold increase of ACE mRNA expression, whereas ACE mRNA levels only increased around 2-fold in uninfected or adeno-GFP (green fluorescent protein) infected cardiomyocytes with similar PMA treatment. The induction of ACE mRNA was blocked by the PKC-beta-specific antagonist LY379196. No significant change of angiotensin II receptors AT1a and AT1b could be detected in the cardiomyocytes expressing PKC-betaII.",

    "378": "Because treating hypertension in the elderly so effectively reduces major cardiovascular events, it is vital to diagnose this very common condition early. Much of the hypertension that occurs with aging results from stiffening of the major capacitance arteries, typically marked by high systolic and low diastolic blood pressures. Pulse pressure, derived by subtracting diastolic from systolic values, is a useful index of stiffness, but new noninvasive techniques for measurement of arterial compliance have shown that blood pressures cannot reliably predict the state of the arteries in older people. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) and the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial demonstrated that treating hypertension in the elderly with diuretics or calcium channel blockers reduces strokes and cardiac events; these results are also clearly evident in high-risk groups like diabetics. Further analysis of Syst-Eur has suggested that a calcium channel blocker reduces new-onset dementia, while follow-up data from SHEP indicate that a diuretic provides survival and stroke benefits in obese or overweight elderly hypertensives, but not in the lean. In general, comparisons of antihypertensive agents, including diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers have found similar clinical end point effects. But recently, the Losartan Intervention For End Point Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study, performed in patients (average age, 67) with left ventricular hypertrophy and predominant systolic hypertension, showed that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was significantly more effective than the beta blocker atenolol in reducing such key outcomes as strokes and new-onset diabetes. Even so, careful but effective control of blood pressure in elderly patients, including those over age 80, still remains a critical factor in preventing major cardiovascular events.",

Reported barriers included a perception that aggressive management of CHD is thought to be unimportant by support staff yet to require significant staff time. Aggressive management of CHD was perceived to incur non-reimbursable costs, to be unimportant in their patient population, to require a great deal of patient education and self-management, and to be limited because many patients do not adhere to therapy.",

The hypoxia may be improved by interventional catheterisation or palliative surgery. The Eisenmenger syndrome is life-threatening in pregnancy or during general anaesthesia.

Regression analysis showed that entry alb-cr ratio, but not CS, predicted nephropathy progression when considering both factors together, but CS predicted progression only when excluding alb-cr ratio. Nephropathy progression was minimal for lower levels of alb-cr ratio at entry, but increased progressively for levels greater than 300. Alb-cr ratio increment during follow-up directly correlated with nephropathy progression (r2 = 0.307; P < 0.001) and was greater in smokers than nonsmokers (1,878 +/- 346 versus 553 +/- 214; P < 0.001).",

We investigated the effects of enalapril, spironolactone, and their combination on hemodynamics and cardiac remodeling in cardiomyopathic hamsters to determine whether these drugs could exert additive effects. Cardiomyopathic hamsters, Bio TO-2 dilated strain, were orally treated with enalapril (20 mg. kg. day ) and/or spironolactone (20 mg. kg. day ) according to a 2 x 2 factorial design from 120 days of age. Animals were investigated at 180 (10 animals per group) and 240 (16 animals per group) days of age. Compared with corresponding untreated groups, enalapril significantly decreased mean blood pressure (-18%); enalapril and spironolactone significantly increased cardiac output (+28%, +11%) and femoral blood flow (+10%, +12%) and significantly decreased systemic (-38%, -17%) and femoral (-26%, -13%) vascular resistances. Enalapril and spironolactone significantly decreased left ventricle cavity area (-21%, -26%) and left (-34%, -47%) and right (-37%, -48%) ventricle collagen density. Spironolactone significantly increased left ventricle wall thickness (+4%). There were significant enalapril x spironolactone interactions for most variables (compared with control group, +52%, +36%, +45% for cardiac output; +26%, +28%, +26% for femoral blood flow; -50%, -30%, -45% for systemic vascular resistance; -33%, -20%, -35% for femoral vascular resistance; -27%, -31%, -40% for left ventricle cavity area; and -46%, -58%, -60% for left and -39%, -50%, -66% for right ventricle collagen density in enalapril, spironolactone, and enalapril + spironolactone groups, respectively).

    "403": "Angiotensin (Ang) II blockade has been shown to prevent the development of renal injury in immunologically mediated diseases, but the mechanism whereby it exerts its protective effect has not been clearly defined. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is a multifunctional cytokine with a potent immunomodulatory activity that has the potential to counteract many of the pro-inflammatory effects apparently evoked by the activation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in immune cells.",

PBMC from healthy controls, when exposed in vitro to 5 microM captopril, showed a significant increase of TGF-beta1 release, whereas the ACEi enalapril failed to modify the expression of the cytokine. Ang II (100 pM) strongly inhibited TGF-beta1 synthesis by PBMC, and such effect was completely abolished by the addition of 200 ng/mL CsA, as well as by 1 micrpM losartan. Thus, captopril enhances TGF-beta1 gene and protein expression by PBMC by way of a mechanism independent, at least in part, from ACE inhibition, while CsA abrogates the inhibition of TGF-beta1 expression induced by Ang II.",

    "407": "We previously reported that pressure loading of the vascular wall can activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), enzymes believed to be involved in the pathway for cell proliferation, partly via the vascular angiotensin system in isolated perfused rat aorta. In this study, we examined whether cyclic stretching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) also produces activation of p42 and p44 MAPKs in cultured rat VSMC and whether stretch-induced MAPK activation is mediated via angiotensin and endothelin systems in VSMC. Cyclic stretching of VSMC produced an elongation-dependent and frequency-dependent increase in p42 and p44 MAPK activity. The stretch-induced p42 and p44 MAPK activation was inhibited by the angiotensin receptor antagonist losartan and by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. The MAPK activation was also inhibited by the endothelin receptor antagonist cyclo(D-alpha-aspartyl-L-prolyl-D-valyl-L-leucyl-D-tryptophyl) (BQ123) and by the endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitor phosphoramidon. Replacement of medium with culture medium of stretched cells caused MAPK activation, which was inhibited by losartan and BQ123. The results of the present study suggest that cyclic stretching of VSMC can activate p42 and p44 MAPKs and that the MAPK activation is mediated via angiotensin and endothelin systems in VSMC.", 
    "408": "The circulation in the left and right coronary beds in pressure overload-induced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy was studied in Wistar male rats (n=6/group) that were subjected to abdominal aortic constriction or to sham-operation. From 3 to 6 weeks after surgery, the animals with aortic constriction received vehicle or 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg per day po of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril. At 6 weeks, after measuring blood pressure in the carotid artery in vivo, the hearts were isolated and the left and right coronary beds subjected to independent perfusion. Minimum coronary vascular resistance per unit heart weight (MCVR/g) was determined in both beds during simultaneous infusion of 10 micromol/L adenosine. Aortic constriction resulted in a significant increase in blood pressure, LV weight/body weight ratio, and bilateral MCVR/g. Ramipril lowered arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner and reversed the increased right MCVR/g at the anti-hypertensive dose, but it did not affect LV mass or left MCVR/g. These results suggest that both coronary hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy contribute to the global impairment of coronary circulation in LV hypertrophy. ACE inhibitors may improve coronary circulation in LV hypertrophy when administrated at an appropriate dose and for a sufficient period.", 
    "409": "In vascular tissues, angiotensin II is potentially cleaved from angiotensin I by chymase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In the normal state, vascular ACE regulates local angiotensin II formation and plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure, whereas chymase is stored in mast cells and has no enzymatic activity. Chymase is activated immediately upon its release into the extracellular matrix in vascular tissues after mast cells have been activated by stimuli such as vessel injury by grafting or a balloon catheter. In dog grafted veins, chymase activity is increased, and the vascular proliferation is suppressed by either a chymase inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker. After balloon injury in dog vessels, chymase activity is significantly increased in the injured artery, and a chymase inhibitor is effective in preventing the vascular proliferation, but an ACE inhibitor is ineffective. Chymase plays an important role in the development of vascular proliferation via the induction of local angiotensin II formation in injured vessels.", 
    "410": "Chymase, a chymotrypsin-like serine protease, has not only alternative angiotensin II-generating activity but also various activities involving inflammatory responses. However, little is known of its contribution to physiological functions. Therefore, chymase inhibitors are thought to be potentially useful as tools for elucidating the physiological functions of chymase and therapeutic agents. Within the last five years, many patents on non-peptide chymase inhibitors have been published. We developed a potent non-peptide chymase inhibitor BCEAB (4-[1-[[bis-(4-methyl-phenyl)-methy]-carbamoyl]-3-(2-ethoxy-benzyl)-4-oxo-azetidine-2-yloxy]-benzoic acid) and examined its effect on inflamed tissue remodeling and fibrosis using a hamster sponge implant model. BCEAB has high inhibitory activity against human chymase but not against angiotensin-converting enzyme, elastase and tryptase. In the hamster sponge implant model, oral administration of BCEAB for 15 days dose-dependently suppressed both the dry weight of granuloma tissues in the sponge discs and the amounts of hydroxyproline in the tissues gradually increased during the experimental period. These results suggest that chymase, at least in part, participates in the growth of granuloma tissues of inflammatory regions by stimulating fibroblast growth and extracellular matrix collagen deposition. Chymase inhibitors for oral administration, such as BCEAB, might be useful for clarifying the pathophysiological roles of chymase in vivo.", 
    "411": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a clinical condition associated with an increased risk of vascular events. Several trials have been done to evaluate the action of different antihypertensive treatments on the regression of LVH IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. The efficacy of diuretics in the reduction of LVH is controversial. The LIVE study (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Regression: Indapamide Versus Enalapril) is a European, prospective, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy of indapamide 1.5 mg daily with that of enalapril 20 mg daily in the reduction of LVH in hypertensive patients (systolic blood pressure > 160 and < 210 mmHg) with LVH (left ventricular mass index 120 g/m2 in men and > 100 g/m2 in women) after 1 year of treatment. The assessment of LVH was done by echocardiography. A blind randomised reading of the echo recordings was performed at the end of the study by an independent Core Echocardiography Committee with three readers. Preliminary data are available from this trial. These data confirm the antihypertensive efficacy of indapamide and its efficacy in the reduction of left ventricular mass through a progressive action over 1 year.", 
    "412": "Using purified enzyme preparations, we investigated the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidase N, and endopeptidase 24.11 on corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). The effects of inhibition of these enzymes on CRF action in rat anterior pituitary cultures were also determined. Finally, specific inhibitors were used to evaluate ectopeptidase action on the regional brain metabolism of CRF. K(m) values for CRF were 165, 90, and 42 microM for angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidase N, and endopeptidase 24.11, respectively. A CRF metabolite profile for each enzyme was determined. In pituitary cultures, inhibition of endopeptidase 24.11 and aminopeptidase N potentiated CRF-stimulated release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In rat pituitary and hypothalamus membrane preparations, specific inhibitor experiments indicated that CRF hydrolysis involved members of the neutral endopeptidase and aminopeptidase enzyme families. In cortex membranes, similar peptidase inhibition was without effect. These data support the hypothesis that ectopeptidases play a major role in CRF metabolism and biological function.", 
    "413": "African-Americans are more likely than Caucasians to develop hypertension-related end-stage renal disease. Elevations in blood pressure levels clearly potentiate pre-existing renal disease and also contribute to kidney injury independently of other primary renal diseases in this cohort. Until recently, data relevant to a full examination of the issue of blood pressure levels and end-stage renal disease in African-Americans have largely been from post-hoc analyses of clinical trials or from small, prospective, short-term studies.", 
    "414": "The most recent United States Renal Data Systems data show hypertension as the primary cause of end-stage renal disease in African-Americans until 1997, diabetes now being the most prevalent etiology. Data from post-hoc analyses of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study demonstrated that African-Americans with a mean arterial pressure above 98 mmHg had a higher risk of end-stage renal disease than Caucasians. The African-American Study of Kidney Disease tested the hypothesis that a blood pressure well below the usual recommended level will further reduce renal disease progression in African-Americans. The study concluded that a blood pressure lower than that needed to reduce cardiovascular events, as defined by the Sixth Joint National Committee Report on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, i.e. 135-140/80-85 mmHg, will not further slow renal disease progression in African-Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Moreover, a regimen of blood pressure lowering anchored on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antihypertensive agents that are touted as ineffective in African-Americans, was more effective than one based on either beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers in slowing the progression of renal injury.", 
    "415": "Systolic blood pressure reduction in the range 130-139 mmHg is appropriate to reduce risk of nephropathy progression and cardiovascular risk in African-Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Moreover, a regimen that is initiated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should be the antihypertensive treatment of choice in African-Americans with kidney disease.",

Stroke prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were treated chronically with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril or placebo, normotensive rats served as controls. Mean arterial and intracavernosal pressure were measured during the induction of erection by autonomic ganglion stimulation. SHRSP-placebo treated rats were hypertensive and had a blunted erectile response. Captopril treatment returned both the blood pressure and erectile response to control levels. Therefore, ACE inhibitor therapy may not be responsible for the erectile dysfunction observed in treated hypertensive subjects.",

Overall 2829 patients (mean age 53.1 years, 65% women) were enrolled in 17 cities of 5 regions in Russia. Nineteen, 68, 10 and 3% of patients had 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd degree of blood pressure elevation and isolated systolic hypertension, respectively. During treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor fosinopril (10-20 mg/day) -/+ hydrochlorothiazide BP level 140/90 mm Hg or 'positive effect' (BP lowering et least by 10%) were achieved in 62.1 and 88.8% of cases, respectively. Average BP level decreased from 162.8/98.7 to 134.2/82.5 mm Hg and lowering of systolic and diastolic BP was 17 and 16%, respectively. The regimen of antihypertensive therapy used in the program was well tolerated and safe (adverse effects were registered in 8.3% of patients, in 5.2% of patients these effects lead to withdrawal of fosinopril). The therapy was equally effective in men and women irrespective of age.

Target BP levels were achieved in 16 patients (70%). Therapy with telmisartan was associated with significant 10.9% reduction of left ventricular myocardial mass index (from 151.6-/+5.4 to 135.1-/+5.9 g/m2, p=0,02) at the account of decreased thickness of left ventricular wall.",

    "422": "Effect of 9-12 month treatment with captopril on dopplerographic parameters of intrarenal blood flow and renal function was studied in 30 hypertensive diabetics without clinical signs of nephroangiopathy. There was an interrelationship between strict blood pressure (BP) control (average 24-hour BP below 135/83) and improvement of parameters of intrarenal hemodynamics. BP normalization and most pronounced positive changes of renal perfusion during therapy with captopril were achieved in patients with mild hypertension and initially high intrarenal resistance yet at the stage of normo- or microalbuminuria. In moderate hypertension with microalbuminuria treatment with captopril was associated with stabilization of parameters of renal blood flow and rate of 24-hour albumin excretion at their initial level despite less strict control of BP and unsatisfactory compensation of diabetes. BP response to captopril in patients with hypertension and diabetes was related to initial state of intrarenal hemodynamics. In patients with mild hypertension indexes of resistance of renal and intrarenal arteries could be used for prediction of sensitivity to antihypertensive action of captopril.", 
    "423": "The value of reflected (tidal) wave amplitude in the pathogenesis of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is discussed and main characteristics of elastic properties of arteries (compliance, distensibility, rigidity, pulse wave velocity, and amplitude of reflected wave) are considered. In ISH systolic and pulse blood pressures are associated with augmentation of the reflected wave amplitude. Increased pulse wave velocity characteristic of ISH leads to displacement of reflected wave from diastole to systole. Summation of two waves (primary and reflected) causes elevation of systolic blood pressure. Choice of antihypertensive drugs for the treatment of ISH is determined by their action on pulse wave velocity, delay of reflected wave and arterial compliance. Preferable agents are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, diuretics and beta-blockers with vasodilating properties. In bradycardia with high stroke volume normalization of heart rate can be achieved by M-anticholinergic drugs and theophylline.",

The overall rate of their side effects is similar to that of placebo. Specific nonproductive cough is much less common during treatment with angiotensin II blockers compared with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Nevertheless serious side effects very rarely occur with angiotensin II blockers and include cough, angioneurotic edema, anemia, liver damage, renal failure, aggravation of angina and migraine. The data of current literature concerning adverse effects of angiotensin II in different clinical situations are extensively reviewed. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers are not considered to be safe in pregnancy, bilateral renal artery stenosis and severe renal or hepatic impairment.",

In low and moderate risk patients (n=31) with borderline hypertension, dyslipidemia and pronounced obesity mainly non-drug measures were employed directed at lowering of excess body mass. Medium risk patients (n=25) with isolated hypertension group were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and phenylalkylamine calcium antagonists. High risk patients (n=55) with metabolic syndrome received same antihypertensive drugs as medium risk patients. In very high risk patients (n=79) with diabetes, excessive body mass, dyslipidemia and proteinuria complex therapy consisting of antihypertensive and hypoglycemic drugs and non-drug interventions was used. This risk stratification based management of patients with hypertension on turned out to be highly effective and resulted not only in normalization of blood pressure but also in improvement of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, lowering of resistance to insulin and excessive body mass, and improvement of renal function.",

Principal role in development of these complications belong to hyperglycemia which triggers such pathological processes as endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impairment of hemostasis and blood rheology. Therefore glucose lowering therapy is pathogenetic not only for diabetes but also for its cardiovascular complications. Glucose lowering drugs should be maximally effective and safe for the cardiovascular system. These requirements gliclaside which in addition to pronounced glucose lowering effect also acts on all links of the pathogenesis of micro- and macroangiopathies. While selecting cardiovascular drugs one should take into consideration their effect on carbohydrate metabolism and cardioprotective properties.

All patients had compensated NYHA class IV chronic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25%. For at least 2 months the patients received therapy with diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (84%) or angiotensin receptor blockers (16%) and then were randomized to either carvedilol or placebo. Average duration of follow-up was 17 months. Carvedilol was well tolerated both during dose titration and during maintenance therapy. Addition of carvedilol to standard therapy of patients with severe heart failure was associated with increase of average ejection fraction from 21.7 to 30.3%. Rates of cardiovascular and sudden deaths, risk of hospitalization among carvedilol treated patients were 25, 33 and 57% less than among patients subjected only to standard therapy.", 
    "428": "Blood flow in extra and intracranial arteries was assessed by doppler ultrasound in 26 hypertensive women without history of stroke. Studies were performed before treatment, after acute test with lisinopril and in 1 month of therapy with lisinopril. Baseline investigation revealed changes of velocity characteristics of blood flow and resistance indexes indicative of impaired cerebral hemodynamics both at extra- and intracranial level. After treatment with lisinopril signs of improvement of blood flow in extra- and intracranial arteries were found. Most important finding was normalization of ability of extracranial arteries to spasm and dilation presumably associated with restoration of hemodynamic reserve of cerebral vessels.",

Most convincing evidence exists for association between the use of diuretics and renal cancer. Association between the use of reserpine and breast cancer in women, between atenolol and some types of cancer in elderly men also can not be ruled out. There is no proof of existence of either negative or positive correlation between malignant neoplasia and long-term use of calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "430": "Harmonic combination of efficacy and safety allowed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) to conquer popularity among physicians in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy. This multiprofile application is determined by their action not only on systemic but also on tissue renin-angiotensin systems which augmented activity plays important role in genesis of various pathological states. One of novel and most promising directions of use of ACEI especially of those with inherent high tissue specificity and vascular selectivity (quinapril, perindopril, ramipril, trandolapril) is the treatment of atherosclerosis. Antiatherosclerotic effects of ACEI were studied in a variety of clinical trials with assessment of their effect on long term outcome. These trials demonstrated positive action of ACEI on the clinical course of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Expediency of prescription of ACEI to patients with atherosclerosis of coronary vessels and other vascular beds irrespective of the presence of hypertension and heart failure becomes now obvious.",

According to statements of these Guidelines most patients with chronic heart failure as a rule should receive combination of representatives of 4 different drug classes - diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, beta-adrenoblocker and usually digoxin. Special indications have been formulated for inclusion in complex therapy of aldosterone receptor blockers (first of all spironolactone), angiotensin1 receptor blockers and direct vasodilators (hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate).",

Lowering of blood pressure was accompanied by regression of clinical symptoms. There were no episodes of excessive blood pressure drop. The use of enalaprilat was associated with normalization of parameters of central and cerebral hemodynamics, lessening of degree of strain of regulatory systems of the body. Diminishment of left atrial dilatation and augmentation of left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in patients with initially dilated left atrium.", 
    "434": "Chronic diffuse renal diseases, involvement of the kidney in systemic and metabolic disorders are characterized by steady progression of renal pathology with loss of functional nephrons, lowering of renal functions and gradual development of chronic and eventually terminal renal failure. Basic mechanism of progression of chronic renal failure is activation of local renin-angiotensin system with intrarenal formation of a potent vasoconstrictor and growth factor - angiotensin II. Potentially nephroprotective effect can be achieved by pharmacological block of angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. It has been shown in some prospective studies (AIPRI, REIN, ACEi-1 Trial, MICRO-HOPE) that the use of these drugs is associated with slowing of progression of renal pathology irrespective of its etiology and delayed development of terminal renal failure in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency. Data available indicate that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be first line agents in the treatment of patients with chronic diffuse renal diseases of various etiology and diabetic nephropathy.",

In 2-6 years before the study all patients had been treated with combination radio- (36-44 Gy) and chemotherapy. Echocardiography revealed endomyocardial fibrosis and signs of cardiac remodeling (reduced left ventricular dimensions and volumes, decreased myocardial mass and impaired diastolic function). The patients were divided into 2 groups. Patients of group 1 were given enalapril (5-10 mg/day), of group 2 - potassium and magnesium aspartate and inosine. In 2 months 68% of patients in group 1 demonstrated improvement of structural and functional state of the heart, no such changes occurred in group 2.", 
    "436": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers have been demonstrated to improve symptoms and prognosis in heart failure (HF). We compared the effects of ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade on myocardial beta-adrenoceptor desensitization in rabbits with HF established 3 weeks after myocardial infarction (MI) with left circumflex coronary artery ligation. Rabbits with MI were randomized to no treatment, the ACE inhibitor temocapril (0.5 mg/kg/day) or AT1 receptor blocker valsartan (3 mg/kg/day). Echocardiographic examinations showed that, relative to rabbits with untreated MI, rabbits receiving temocapril or valsartan had a limitation of cardiac remodeling and prevention of the development of systolic dysfunction. Circulating plasma norepinephrine levels that were markedly elevated in MI animals were strongly inhibited by temocapril or valsartan therapy. beta-Adrenoceptor density, beta-adrenoceptor proportion showing high-affinity agonist binding, and basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were significantly reduced in MI rabbits. These defects were similarly reversed by temocapril or valsartan. Importantly, as found in human HF, myocardial protein levels of beta-adrenoceptor kinase 1 and G(i alpha) were significantly elevated in MI rabbits, suggesting that these molecules are contributing to the defects in myocardial beta-adrenoceptor signaling. The expression levels of these molecules were normalized equally by both treatments. The results suggest that pharmacologically different interventions in the renin-angiotensin system can equivalently improve the derangements in the beta-adrenoceptor signaling system in the failing heart. This may be important for the beneficial effects of these agents in HF.", 
    "437": "We had reported that in the ischemic heart, locally formed bradykinin (BK) and angiotensin II (Ang II) activate B2- and AT1-receptors on sympathetic nerve terminals (SNE), promoting reversal of the norepinephrine (NE) transporter in an outward direction (i.e., carrier-mediated NE release). Although both BK and Ang II contribute to ischemic NE release, Ang II is likely to play a more important role. Since BK is formed by ischemic SNE, we questioned whether cardiac SNE also contribute to local Ang II formation, in addition to being a target of Ang II. SNE were isolated from surgical specimens of human right atrium and incubated in ischemic conditions. These SNE released large amounts of endogenous NE via a carrier-mediated mechanism, as evidenced by the inhibitory effect of desipramine on this process. Moreover, two renin inhibitors, pepstatin-A and BILA 2157 BS, the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat and the AT1-receptor antagonist EXP3174 prevented ischemic NE release. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of renin in cardiac SNE. Renin abundance increased more than three-fold during ischemia. Thus, renin is present in cardiac SNE and is activated during ischemia, eventually culminating in Ang II formation, stimulation of AT1-receptors and carrier-mediated NE release. Our findings uncover a novel autocrine mechanism, by which Ang II, formed at SNE in myocardial ischemia, elicits carrier-mediated NE release by activating prejuntional AT1-receptors.", 
    "438": "Bradykinin is a major mediator of swelling in C1 inhibitor deficiency as well as the angioedema seen with ACE inhibitors and may contribute to bronchial hyper-reactivity in asthma. Formation of bradykinin occurs in the fluid phase and along cell surfaces requiring interaction of Factor XII, prekallikrein and high molecular weight kininogen (HK). The mechanism by which initiation occurs is uncertain. Recent data suggest that activation of the kinin-forming cascade can occur on the surface of endothelial cells, even in the absence of Factor XII. We demonstrate herein that during a 2-h incubation time, plasma deficient in either Factor XII or high molecular weight kininogen (HK) fail to activate kinin-forming cascade as compared to normal plasma. With more prolonged incubation, Factor XII deficient plasma gradually activates and HK deficient plasma does not. Our data support both Factor XII-dependent (rapid) and Factor XII-independent (slow) mechanisms; the latter may require a cell-derived protein (possibly protease) to activate prekallikrein in the presence of zinc ion and HK. To further define this cellular factor, we demonstrated that both cytosolic and membrane fractions from endothelial cells possessed the ability to catalyze prekallikrein conversion to kallikrein in the presence of HK and zinc ion. We purified this factor from cytosol by affinity chromatography employing corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI) as ligand. The fractions with peak activity were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, ligand blotted with biotinylated CTI, and positive bands were sequenced. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) was identified as one of the proteins. Zinc-dependent activation of the prekallikrein-HK complex on endothelial cells was inhibited upon the addition of polyclonal antibody to Hsp90 in a dose-dependent manner. Although the mechanism by which Hsp90 activates the kinin-forming cascade is not yet clear, this protein represents the cellular contribution to the reaction and may become the dominant mechanism in pathologic circumstances in which Hsp90 is highly expressed or secreted.", 
    "439": "ACE or kininase II inhibitors are very important, widely used therapeutic agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Although they inhibit ACE, thus, angiotensin II release and bradykinin (BK) inactivation, this inhibition alone does not suffice to explain their successful application in medical practice. Enalaprilat and other ACE inhibitors at nanomolar concentrations activate the BK B1 receptor directly in the absence of ACE and the peptide ligands, des-Arg-kinins. The inhibitors activate at the Zn-binding pentameric consensus sequence HEXXH (195 -199) of B1, a motif also present in the active centers of ACE but absent from the BK B2 receptor. ACE inhibitors, when activating the B1 receptor, elevate intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i and release NO from cultured cells. Activation by ACE inhibitor was abolished by Ca-EDTA, a B1 receptor antagonist, by a synthetic undecapeptide representing the 192-202 sequence in the B1 receptor, and by site-directed mutagenesis of H195 to A. With the exception of the B1 receptor blocker, these agents and the mutation did not affect the actions of the peptide ligand des-Arg10-Lys1-BK. Ischemia and inflammatory cytokines induce B1 receptors and elevate its expression. Direct activation of the B1 receptor by ACE inhibitors can contribute to their therapeutic efficacy, for example, by releasing NO in vascular beds, or to some of their side effects.", 
    "440": "The existence and importance of the kallikrein-kinin-kininase system, especially in the circulation, has taken over three-quarters of a century to be established. Finding the multiple components derived from renin-angiotensin and their functions stretched over a century [Erd\u00f6s EG. Perspectives on the early history of angiotensin-converting enzyme-recent follow-ups. In: Giles TD, editor. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE): clinical and experimental insights. Fort Lee: Health Care Communications; 2001, p. 3-16]. Although the discoveries were made independently, it was shown in 1970 that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is identical with kininase II, previously discovered by us, thus, a single protein can regulate either the activation or inactivation of the two peptide products. It followed that inhibitors of ACE can affect both processes [Bhoola KD, Figueroa CD, Worthy K. Bioregulation of kinins: kallikreins, kininogens, and kininases. Pharmacol Rev 1992;44:1-80]. After being engaged for a long time in characterizing the metabolism of various bio-active peptides, we, as well as others, noticed that the effect of ACE inhibitors go beyond simply blocking angiotensin (Ang) II release and bradykinin (BK) inactivation by the enzyme (Kaplan AP, Joseph K, Silverberg M. Pathways for bradykinin formation and inflammatory disease. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2002; 109(2):195-209, Yamada K, Erd6s EG. Kallikrein and prekallikrein of the isolated basolateral membrane of rat kidney. Kidney Int 1982;22:331-7]. It also became apparent to us that in the complex multistep reactions needed to activate the kallikrein-kinin system, there should be some shortcuts-shunts-to accelerate and simplify important processes. Thus, some basic tenets developed after decades of intensive laboratory investigations-and by now generally accepted-can be challenged. For example, it should be considered that the activities of BK and Lys BK (kallidin) can be substantially different, and that sequentially linked reactions, starting with prokallikrein activation and leading to kinin release from kininogen and inhibition of kininases, may be only one way to activate kinin receptors. A summary of some suggested alterations on prevailing concepts is given below.",

The protonated quasi-molecular ion (m/z 430) of 1, obtained under positive electrospray ionization conditions, loses a benzoic acid molecule (m/z 308), which in turn decomposes via loss of CO (m/z 280) when low-energy collisional-induced dissociation (CID) and in-source experiments are performed. This rearrangement is the main fragmentation process and can be observed both in-source and in the product ion tandem mass spectra, using either an ion trap or a triple quadrupole instrument. Other known diastereoisomers of 1, an impurity with an acetyl in the place of the benzoyl group (2) and an impurity with two propanoyl chains in series (3), give the same rearrangement. On the other hand, the mass spectra of the methyl ester (4) and an impurity with two proline moieties (5) do not show this unusual fragmentation. Time-resolved CID spectra of 1 show that the rearrangement occurs after about 2 ms, a time scale comparable to those of the other non-rearrangement cleavages. These experiments suggest a conformation in the gas phase for 1 in which the benzoyl group is close to the hydroxyl of the carboxylic acid group, from which the rearrangement could readily occur. Since compounds 4 and 5 do not show the same behaviour, the presence of a carboxylic acid in the proline ring seems to play a crucial role in the rearrangement, probably due to an intramolecular hydrogen bond. To confirm this hypothesis, deuterium exchanges in mass spectrometric experiments and a conformational analysis via computational methods were performed.",

In this work a novel approach combining HPLC-UV on-line with oaTOF-MS and ICPMS was applied to investigate in human and rat plasma the metabolism of labelled BK (79/81 Br-Phe5) BrBK in the presence of two new dual ACE/NEP inhibitors (GW660511X and omapatrilat) currently under clinical trial. In human plasma the BrBK half-life values in the absence or in the presence of GW660511X (3.8 microM) or omapatrilat (32 nM) were 38.7 +/- 2.4, 51.2 +/- 4.7 and 114.7 +/- 9.3 min, respectively and BrBK was degraded into BrBK1-8, BrBK1-7, BrBK1-5 and Br-Phe. In the presence of inhibitors, however, the levels of these resultant metabolites were different. Unlike GW660511X, omapatrilat abolished the production of BrBK1-5 and BrBK1-7, suggesting a better ACE inhibition effect over GW660511X as no NEP activity was found. In addition the production of BrBK1-8 was enhanced in the presence of these inhibitors with a greater accumulation being observed with omapatrilat. The production of Br-Phe5 was reduced with GW660511X while no significant change was observed with omapatrilat after 4 h of incubation. In rat plasma the BrBK half-life values in the absence or in the presence of GW660511X (530 nM) or omapatrilat (50 nM) were 9.31 +/- 1.7, 22.06 +/- 3.1 and 25.3 +/- 1.7 min, respectively and BrBK was degraded into BrBK1-8, BrBK1-7, BrBK1-5 and Br-Phe5 plus BrBK2-9, BrBK4-8 and BrBK2-8 metabolites not found in human plasma. GW660511X and omapatrilat reduced the production of BrBK1-5 and BrBK1-7 with more effect being observed with omapatrilat. GW660511X and omapatrilat increased the production of both BrBK1-8 and Br-Phe5 but not that of BrBK4-8 and BrBK2-8. This study shows that the potency of GW660511X in comparison with omapatrilat is more than 100-fold lower in human, but less than 10-fold lower in rat plasma, suggesting that rat may not be a suitable in vivo model for the evaluation of ACE/NEP inhibition in relation to effects in humans.",

Hypertension is one of the major complications, and its control might affect the renal survival and disease mortality. Suitable antihypertensive agents have been discussed based on clinical and animal studies, but no definitive conclusion has been reached. Generally, therefore, all antihypertensives are indiscriminately treated as if providing the same level of blood pressure control. In this study, the blood pressure control of two antihypertensives was investigated using a rat model of ADPKD in humans. Twenty-four male Hannover-Sprague Dawley (Han:SPRD) rats were divided into three groups: a group receiving amlodipine (6 mg/day), a group receiving benazepril (6 mg/day) and an untreated control group. Blood pressure, body weight, and urinary protein excretion were regularly measured up to week 52. Amlodipine and benazepril significantly decreased blood pressure and urinary protein excretion to the same degree. Moreover, a remarkably prolonged survival rate was observed in both groups (at week 52, the survival rate was 25% in controls, 50% in the amlodipine group, and 50% in the benazepril group). Examination at autopsy revealed that enlarged cysts were prevalent in the renal tissue of both experimental all three groups, suggesting that the cystic disease had reached the end-stage in all the animals.

The systolic blood pressure was reduced exclusively in the TM and TM+Ex group. Epididymal fat pads (EPI) weighed less in the TM+Ex group than in the single-treatment (TM) group. The serum leptin level was significantly and directly correlated with the EPI weight (p < 0.001). The TNF-alpha content per gram of EPI was the highest in the TM+Ex group. In addition, the EPI TNF-alpha level was negatively correlated with both the EPI weight and the serum leptin level (p < 0.001, respectively). In contrast, the TNF-alpha level of skeletal muscles was identical among the groups. The extensor digitorum longus had a significantly higher abundance of TNF-alpha protein than the soleus muscle. These data indicate that the local TNF-alpha expression is tissue-specific, and that upregulation of TNF-alpha in EPI by exercise training and/or ACE inhibition may have contributed to the reduction in fat cell volume via the induction of apoptosis and/or the regulation of metabolic homeostasis.",

For patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is known to be effective and well tolerated and to be protective against chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). However, serious adverse reactions to ACE inhibitors, such as the rapid deterioration of renal function, have been reported, making physicians hesitant to use these agents. To resolve this dilemma, we compared changes in renal function and left ventricular function and the safety and effectiveness of benazepril, an ACE inhibitor, in patients with diabetic nephropathy, with or without LVH. The age, sex, duration of diabetes, levels of blood pressure and blood glucose and rates of creatinine clearance (CrCl) were compared between 36 diabetic patients with LVH and 36 matched diabetic patients without LVH. The rates of CrCl in all patients were between 14 and 35 ml/min, and all patients received an ACE inhibitor before enrollment. The group comprised 43 men and 29 women, with a mean age of 56 +/- 4 years. These patients were divided into three groups, each of which was subdivided into a group with and a group without LVH. Group I (without LVH) or I-L (with LVH) received a half dose of benazepril (2.5 mg daily), Group II (without LVH) or II-L (with LVH) received a normal daily dose of 5 mg benazepril, and Group III (without LVH) or III-L (with LVH) discontinued the administration of the ACE inhibitor. The follow-up period was 1 year and, during the study, blood pressure was maintained at less than 140/90 mmHg. If the blood pressure control was not satisfactory, benidipine, a calcium antagonist, and/or furosemide, a loop diuretic, and/or guanabenz, a central acting antihypertensive agent, were administered. In the diabetic patients with LVH, the administration of a normal dose of benazepril inhibited the decline of renal function and cardiac function (CrCl: 24.2 +/- 1.5 to 22.0 +/- 2.5 ml/min; EF (ejection fraction): 56 +/- 3 to 54 +/- 6%) compared to the other two groups. In patients without LVH, a half dose of benazepril preserved renal function (23.4 +/- 2.6 to 22.0 +/- 3.1 ml/min; EF: 54 +/- 3 to 56 +/- 3%). Discontinuation of the administration of ACE inhibitor led to the further progression of renal dysfunction and decreases in EF in patients with or without LVH. Our results provide some indications for the use of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients when renal dysfunction and/or cardiac hypertrophy are present.",

We therefore compared the antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects of combined therapy with either a calcium channel blocker (CCB) plus an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) plus an ARB in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by overt nephropathy and mild to moderate hypertension. After a 12-week dietary control period, diabetic patients with mildly to moderately impaired renal function were randomly assigned to either a CCB (amlodipine 5 mg once daily) or an ACE-I (temocapril 2 mg once daily) for 12 weeks (monotherapy period). Both groups then received add-on therapy with an ARB (candesartan 4 mg once daily) for an additional 12 weeks. During the monotherapy period, blood pressure was decreased equally well in both groups. Daily urinary protein excretion remained unchanged in the CCB-treated group (control period, 4.0 +/- 1.8 g/day vs. CCB period, 4.1 +/- 1.9 g/day; ns; n = 8), but decreased in the ACE-I-treated group (control period, 4.3 +/- 1.8 g/day vs. ACE-I period, 3.5 +/- 1.7 g/day; p < 0.05; n = 9). After the combined therapy period, blood pressure was decreased to the same degree in both groups. Although ARB plus CCB significantly reduced urinary protein excretion (to 3.5 +/- 1.5 g/day; p < 0.05 vs. control period; n = 8), a more profound reduction was achieved with ARB plus ACE-I (to 2.6 +/- 1.3 g/day; p < 0.01 vs. control period; n = 9). Monotherapy with the ACE-I increased the serum potassium concentration, and this elevation was sustained after addition of the ARB. In contrast, the serum potassium concentration was not influenced by monotherapy with the CCB, but was significantly increased after addition of the ARB. A decreased hematocrit was observed in the ARB plus ACE-I group. The present study suggests that combined antihypertensive therapy with either a CCB plus an ARB or an ACE-I plus an ARB exerts an antiproteinuric effect in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy with mildly impaired renal function. Although the latter combination had a more profound effect, it was associated with an increased serum potassium concentration and worsening of renal anemia. Thus, the combination of a CCB and an ARB should be the first line antihypertensive therapy in those with overt diabetic nephropathy. The long-term efficacy of these combined antihypertensive therapies will need to be further addressed in a future study.", 
    "479": "It has been reported that treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is not adequate to suppress aldosterone, and we previously demonstrated that adding spironolactone to an ACE inhibitor may have beneficial effects on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in selected patients with essential hypertension (EH). We have extended our previous short-term study, and addressed the relative long-term clinical effects of spironolactone and an ACE inhibitor in patients with EH who have LVH. Twenty patients with EH and concomitant LVH participated in this study. Subjects were treated with either an ACE inhibitor alone (group 1: 10 patients) or an ACE inhibitor plus spironolactone at the dose of 25 mg (group 2: 10 patients) for 60 weeks. The baseline clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. Final values of blood pressure were also similar between the two groups. The LV mass index (LVMI) decreased significantly in both groups, but the extent of reduction was significantly greater in group 2 at 60 weeks. The early peak to atrial peak filling velosities ratio (E/A ratio) was significantly increased to a similar extent in both groups. Serum procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide (PIIINP) was significantly decreased in group 2, but not in group 1. In group 2, there was a statistically significant correlation between the changes in LVMI and PIIINP. In conclusion, adding spironolactone to therapy with an ACE inhibitor for 60 weeks may have beneficial effects in patients with EH and concomitant LVH. Our study strongly suggests the possibility that attenuation of the effects of cardiac aldosterone in patients with EH by treatment with spironolactone and an ACE inhibitor may become a new goal for the prevention and regression of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "480": "Aortic aneurysm is a chronic degenerative condition associated with atherosclerosis. Recent studies have revealed that angiotensin (Ang) II plays important roles in atherosclerosis. In this study, to investigate the relationship between aortic aneurysm and Ang II, we measured the activities of the angiotensin (Ang) II-forming enzymes, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase-like enzyme, in human aneurysmal and control aortae. Aneurysmal aortic specimens were obtained from 16 aneurysm patients and control aortic specimens were obtained from 16 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (8 patients in each group were administered ACE inhibitors). The ACE and chymase-like enzyme activities were determined using extracts from vascular tissues. Both the ACE and chymase-like enzyme activities in the aneurysmal aortae were significantly higher than those in the control aortae (p < 0.01). In the patients treated with ACE inhibitors, the ACE activity in the aneurysmal aortae tended to be low, but the chymase-like enzyme activity tended to be high. In the aneurysmal aortae, the chymase-like enzyme activity in the adventitia was significantly higher than that in the intimal or medial layers (p < 0.01), while differences in ACE activity were not observed. Our results suggest that increases in local Ang II formation induced by chymase-like enzymes may play important roles in the pathogenesis of aneurysmal formation.",

Low systolic blood pressure at baseline, raised creatinine, reduced serum sodium or haemoglobin, and increased heart rate were associated with chronic heart failure death.

To improve inhibitor binding, the peptide was modified by replacing cysteine with other sulfhydryl-containing compounds. Ten peptides were synthesized. One peptide adapted the structure of captopril to the binding requirements of BoNT A, but it was a weak inhibitor, suggesting that angiotensin-converting enzyme is not a good model for BoNT A inhibitor development. However, replacing cysteine with 2-mercapto-3-phenylpropionyl yielded a peptide with K(i) of 330 nM, the best inhibitor of BoNT A protease activity reported to date. Additional modifications of the inhibitor revealed structural elements important for binding and supported our earlier findings that, with the exception of P1' arginine, subsites on BoNT A are not highly specific for particular amino acid side chains.",

NS developed 1-4 months post transplant in the four patients with minimal-change disease, but later (33-151 months) in the others. At onset, serum creatinine was normal or elevated. Treatment included calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or both, together with routine antirejection therapy. Remission was achieved 4-12 months after onset, when renal function remained normal in four, improved in four, and worsened in one. At last follow-up, six patients still had remission and functional grafts. One lost graft to chronic transplant nephropathy while NS remained in remission. In the remaining patient, proteinuria, which was due to chronic transplant glomerulopathy unrelated to the initial minimal-change disease-associated NS, recurred 50 months post transplant. Remission of post-transplant NS is possible. It is often associated with minimal-change diseases and less frequently with other glomerular lesions, including acute glomerulitis. Reversible post-transplant NS does not have an adverse effect on the renal allografts.",

This was due to an attenuation of the increase of intima and media thickness. Treatment with LU and trandolapril were similarly effective in attenuating the increase of the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells in the intima. Again, combination treatment did not confer additional benefit. In contrast, trandolapril was more effective than LU in attenuating the increase in the number of PCNA-positive cells in the media.

Valve repair was achieved with an annuloplasty ring in all 102 patients, while 99 underwent concomitant myocardial revascularization. Preoperatively, 69 patients had MR grade III-IV, 62 had CCS angina class III-IV, 59 were in NYHA class II-IV, 81 had impaired left ventricular function, and 10 were in cardiogenic shock.

The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a ubiquitous mediator in calcium signaling and modulates calcium handling and growth mechanisms in cardiomyocytes. Here we present data on expression of cardiac isoforms of CaMKIIdelta, the dominant form in the myocardium, in compensatory hypertrophy of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) compared to the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control strain. Cardiac hypertrophy in SHRSP was documented by an increased heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW) of 31% (p < 0.05) and a more than six-fold elevated atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) transcript level (p < 0.05). Compensatory hypertrophic growth in SHRSP produced a specific phenotype of CaMKIIdelta isoforms characterized by increased transcript levels of the embryonic/neonatal isoform delta4 (48%, p < 0.05) and the isoform delta9 (31%, p < 0.05) with no changes in delta2 and delta3. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by cilazapril completely regressed myocardial hypertrophy, normalized ANF transcript levels, and restored the normal phenotype of CaMKIIdelta by reducing transcripts for delta4 and delta9 to levels present in WKY controls. Our data suggest the importance of specific changes in the CaMKII isoform composition for growth processes in the myocardium.",

The 5 main categories of drugs used in the initial treatment of hypertensive vascular diseases are (1). diuretics, (2). beta-adrenergic blockers, (3). calcium channel blockers, (4). angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and (5). angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There are also other less commonly used drugs. Each of the antihypertensive agents is roughly equally effective, producing a good antihypertensive response in 40% to 60% of cases. Some antihypertensives, especially ACE and ARBs, also may have beneficial effects on the vascular and metabolic systems separate from their blood pressure lowering effects, which suggests they may be beneficial even if blood pressure is well maintained with other agents.

This pilot study was carried out to determine if a small dose of an ACE-I would retard the progression of moderate to severe DR in normotensive Type 2 diabetic patients. Normotensive patients were selected to isolate the effect on the ocular RAS independent of any lowering of blood pressure. Thirty-five normotensive Type 2 diabetic patients with <1+ dipstick proteinuria and with moderate to severe DR by modified Arlie House Classification criteria on seven field stereoscopic photographs through dilated pupils were randomized to an ACE-I (5 mg of enalapril) (n=18) or to a multivitamin (MVI) placebo (n=17). They were evaluated by an ophthalmologist every 3 months for a planned duration of 2 years. Endpoints of the study were progression to proliferative DR (PDR) or macular edema (ME) for which laser therapy was necessary or for the development of >/=1+ dipstick proteinuria times two (sustained proteinuria) for which an ACE-I was indicated. There were no differences in baseline age, gender, duration of diabetes, body mass indices, blood pressure, treatment of hyperglycemia or Hb A1C levels between the two groups. Blood pressure and Hb A1C levels did not change in either group during the study. The study was stopped prematurely after a mean duration of 7.2 months after an interim analysis revealed that it was very unlikely that a beneficial effect of ACE-I could be shown. At that time in the ACE-I group, four patients had progressed to PDR, three to ME and one had developed sustained proteinuria. In the MVI group, three patients had progressed to PDR, one to ME and one had developed sustained proteinuria. Small doses of an ACE-I did not exert a beneficial effect on the progression of moderate to severe DR over a short period of follow-up. An analysis of previously published clinical information on the effects of ACE-I, most of which evaluated patients with milder DR, supports only a limited (if any) beneficial effect of this class of drugs on the early stages of this microvascular complication.",

Blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) is important in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. With the reports of recently completed trials examining the role of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in type 2 diabetic nephropathy, the question has arisen as to which agents are best to block the RAS in type 2 diabetes. ACE inhibitors have been to preserve renal function in type 1 diabetics with nephropathy in large, randomized, placebo controlled trials, but such data is lacking in type 2 diabetes. Neverthelesss, ACE inhibitors have been recommended for use in type 2 diabetic nephropathy for some time. In type 2 diabetics, ACE inhibitors may have a role in preventing development of nephropathy, and, importantly, ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease in diabetics with and without nephropathy. In addition, ACE inhibitors have beneficial effects on other diabetic complications such as retinopathy and neuropathy. Until better comparative data between ACE inhibitors and ARBs on nephropathy and cardiovascular outcomes is available, ACE inhibitors should remain an important consideration for treatment of diabetic nephropathy.",

SVR was determined in supine and seated positions in 12 HF patients [NYHA class II-III; ejection fraction=0.29 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SE)] and 9 control subjects. HF patients were investigated during high (n=11; withdrawal of ACE-I treatment for 24 h) and low (n=9; sustained ACE-I therapy) endogenous plasma Ang II concentrations. Withdrawal of ACE-I therapy in HF caused moderately increased Ang II concentrations of 30 +/- 5 pg/ml compared with 12 +/- 2 pg/ml in controls (p<0.05 vs. HF patients). Despite this, SVR was similar in HF (supine: 1503 +/- 159; seated: 1957 +/- 262 dyn s/cm5, p<0.05 vs. supine) and controls (supine: 1438 +/- 104; seated: 1847 +/- 127 dyn s/cm5, p<0.05 vs. supine). During sustained ACE-I therapy in HF, plasma Ang II concentrations were lower (6 +/- 2pg/ml, p<0.05 vs. withdrawal of ACE-I in HF) with no effect on supine SVR. However, the posture-induced increase in SVR in response to the seated position was attenuated. In conclusion, brief moderate increases in circulating plasma Ang II concentrations in compensated HF do not increase SVR compared to control subjects or impair control of SVR in response to a posture change.",

Pulmonary level of NO end products, nitrite and nitrate, tended to rise but did not reach a significant level. Glutathione (GSH) content and GSH-peroxidase activity measured in the lung remained unaltered. In animals given concurrent treatment of BLM and ARG, a remarkable rise in the pulmonary level of nitrite and nitrate was observed. Average body weight was still decreased when compared with the untreated control group, but the decrease was significantly less than that observed in the BLM group. In addition, ARG decreased the extent of BLM-induced elevations of lung HP and LP levels. Meanwhile, ARG failed to significantly affect the BLM-evoked decrease in pulmonary ACE activity and increase in lung weight/body weight ratio. In animals given simultaneous treatment of BLM and L-NAME, noticeable reductions in the pulmonary levels of nitrite/nitrate and GSH were detected.

Antihypertensive therapy with telmisartan had a favorable effect, i.e. significantly decreased the rest BP--both SBP (152.5 +/- 11.4 mmHg vs. 139.2 +/- 12.3 mmHg, p < 0.001) and DBP (100.0 +/- 4.6 mmHg vs. 88.7 +/- 6.2 mmHg, p < 0.001). There were no significant changes in the heart rate (HR) at rest prior and after telmisartan treatment (71.4 +/- 9.1 b/min vs. 72.2 +/- 10.4 b/min). When repeating the exercise test after 12 weeks of telmisartan treatment we detected the significant decrease of BP at maximal workload, i.e. SBP decreased from 230.9 +/- 11.4 mmHg to 211.3 +/- 12.7 mmHg, p < 0.05 and DBP decreased from 124.6 +/- 7.5 mmHg to 109.7 +/- 9.7 mmHg, p < 0.05. There was a significant decrease in HR (140.6 +/- 13.2 b/min vs. 130.1 +/- 14.2 b/min, p < 0.05) and significant increase in JT interval at maximal workload after telmisartan treatment (0.193 +/- 0.014 sec vs. 0.201 +/- 0.014 sec, p < 0.05). Telmisartan decreased the double product at rest and maximal workload (diff. of 16 x 10(2) mmHg x b/min and 48 mmHg x 10(2) b/min, respectively, p < 0.05).", 
    "530": "Twelve weeks of the telmisartan treatment showed a significant decrease of blood pressure at rest and exercise with no effect on the heart rate at rest in patients with mild and moderate arterial hypertension. There was statistically significant decrease in HR at maximal workload after the treatment by telmisartan.", 
    "531": "The double contrast pharyngogram by use of computed radiography (DCP-CR) has been found to be useful in detection of asymptomatic swallowing dysfunction. Following the DCP-CR examination, we investigated the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in 143 patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease (CVD) for 3 years and the effects of ACE inhibitors on the prevention of pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia occurred in 29 out of 143 patients, and more frequently in the elderly chronic CVD patients with multiple brain lesions. Aspiration pneumonia was confirmed in 26 out of 85 patients (30.6%) with abnormal barium adhesion to the pharyngeal wall on the double contrast pharyngogram image by DCP-CR; whereas pneumonia occurred in 3 out of 58 patients (5.2%) with normal findings of DCP-CR pharyngogram. Among chronic CVD patients with abnormal findings of DCP-CR pharyngogram, the incidence of aspiration pneumonia was significantly lower in the patients treated with ACE inhibitors than in those treated with other antihypertensive agents or without antihypertensive agents (chi 2 value = 7.163, p < 0.05). Accordingly, ACE inhibitors may prevent the aspiration pneumonia and reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the chronic CVD patients with abnormal DCP-CR pharyngogram images.",

At baseline, after 3 months, and at 1 year they underwent 6-min walk test, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, and blood measurements of ANP, BNP, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine.", 
    "534": "After 1 year, 17 patients remained clinically stable, and did not change their therapy and functional class. Also echocardiographic data and neurohormonal parameters did not change significantly except for epinephrine that decreased significantly after 3 months and returned to a value similar to the basal one at 1 year. Two outliner values were observed for norepinephrine belonging to the only 2 patients that spontaneously withdrew the ace-inhibitor therapy during the follow-up.", 
    "535": "This study indicates that plasma concentration of neurohormones and peptides were fairly stable over 1 year interval in stable patients with mild-moderate heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy and that norepinephrine could be considered as the most sensible parameters to monitor therapy compliance.", 
    "536": "It is well established that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEI) reduce blood pressure (BP) and hypertrophy of the left ventricle and vessels. The aim of our study was to compare chemically different ACEIs regarding their ability to modulate left ventricular and media hypertrophy, ACE activity and plasma endothelin-1 concentrations in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).", 
    "537": "After establishing equi-effective dose regimes, SHRs were treated (3 months) with captopril, enalapril, fosinopril or ramipril (2 x 25, 10, 20 or 1 mg/kg per day or corresponding 1% doses for studying blood pressure-independent effects).", 
    "538": "Systolic blood pressure was reduced in SHRs receiving high doses of captopril, enalapril, fosinopril or ramipril (-61, -54, -35 and -47 mmHg), whereas low doses were ineffective. Left ventricular weight was decreased in animals treated with high doses (captopril/enalapril/fosinopril/ramipril: -17/-19/-17/-19%), but not low doses of agents. Media thickness of thoracal aorta was reduced by administering high doses (captopril/enalapril/fosinopril/ramipril: -31/-32/-27/-26%) and low doses (-16/-22/-22/-19%) of agents. ACE activity was reduced in heart, aorta and kidney of rats treated with high and low doses of all ACE inhibitors, whereby high doses showed more pronounced effects. Plasma endothelin-1 concentrations were not altered. A blood-pressure-ineffective treatment with an AT -antagonist revealed similar effects on cardiovascular hypertrophy.", 
    "539": "ACEIs reduce cardiovascular hypertrophy uniformly via an AT -receptor- mediated mechanism, reinforcing the opinion that ACEI effects are indeed class effects. The significance of local renin-angiotensin systems was confirmed by antihypertrophic effects in the aorta that were apparent in the absence of any blood pressure reduction.",

The maximal rate of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by submitochondrial membranes was also evaluated at 18 months by the scopoletin-horseradish peroxidase method.", 
    "543": "No significant increase was found in the antioxidant enzymes measured. At 6 months, Mn-SOD was actually decreased in E and catalase in both E and L, whereas at 18 months Se-glutathione peroxidase was decreased in L. Production of NO by submitochondrial particles was 64% higher at 6 months in E and 105% higher at 18 months in E and L. Maximal hydrogen peroxide production was lower at 18 months in both groups.",

    "545": "Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is a well-established model for the study of interstitial fibrosis in the kidney. It has been shown that the renin-angiotensin system plays a central role in the progression of interstitial fibrosis. Recent studies indicate that endothelin, a powerful vasoconstrictive peptide, may play an important role in some types of renal disease. To investigate the effects of angiotensin II on endothelin and its receptors in the kidney, mice were subjected to UUO and treated with or without enalapril, an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in their drinking water (100 mg/l). The animals were killed 5 days later. Using RT coupled with PCR, we measured the levels of endothelin-1, endothelin A, and endothelin B (ET(B)) along with transforming growth factor-beta, TNF-alpha, and collagen type IV mRNA expression in the kidney with UUO and the contralateral kidney along with interstitial expansion in the kidney cortex by a standard point counting method. We found that enalapril administration ameliorated the increased expression of ET-1 mRNA in the obstructed kidney by 44% (P < 0.02). Although the level of endothelin A mRNA expression was significantly increased in the obstructed kidney, it was not affected by enalapril. We found that enalapril treatment increased ET(B) mRNA expression by 115% (P < 0.05) and protein expression (measured by Western blot) in the kidney with an obstructed ureter. Enalapril treatment alone inhibited the expansion of interstitial volume due to UUO by 52%. Cotreatment with enalapril and the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ-788 inhibited the expression of interstitial volume by only 19%. This study confirms that enalapril inhibits the interstitial fibrosis in UUO kidneys. It also suggests a beneficial and unforeseen effect of enalapril on the obstructed kidney by potentially stimulating the production of nitric oxide through an increased expression of the ET(B) receptor.", 
    "546": "Many studies have reported that blocking the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker in the patient with diabetes mellitus leads to an increase in renal plasma flow (RPF), no change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and a fall in filtration fraction. This constellation is generally attributed to predominant efferent arteriolar dilation.", 
    "547": "This study examined the renal hemodynamic response to blocking the RAS with both captopril and candesartan on separate days in 31 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "548": "There was a wide range of changes in RPF and GFR in response to the two agents, each administered at the top of its dose-response range. The RPF response to the two agents was strongly concordant (r = 0.65; P < 0.001), as was the GFR response (r = 0.81; P < 0.001). Moreover, there was a strong correlation between the RPF response and the change in GFR with each agent (r = 0.83 and 0.66; P < 0.01). A significant rise in RPF was followed by a rise in GFR. The RPF dependency of GFR in the type 1 diabetics suggests strongly that glomerular filtration equilibrium exists in the glomeruli of the diabetic kidney: Simple notions of local control based on afferent:efferent arteriolar resistance ratios are too simplistic.",

    "550": "Control of blood pressure (BP) and optimal reduction of proteinuria (Uprot) are necessary for long-term renoprotection. Unfortunately, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists are not effective during sodium repletion. Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI) cause dual inhibition of ACE and neutral endopeptidase, the latter resulting in decreased atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) breakdown and thus enhanced natriuresis. Therefore, in contrast with ACEI, VPI may be effective during high sodium intake.", 
    "551": "To test this hypothesis, the renoprotective actions of the new VPI gemopatrilat (GEM) were studied during low (0.05% NaCl) and high (3.0% NaCl) sodium diets in normotensive Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis. The ACEI lisinopril (LIS) was used as control. Rats received either GEM (0.3 mg/g chow), an equihypotensive dose of LIS (75 mg/L drinking water), or vehicle (VEH) from week 6 (that is, established Uprot) until sacrifice. The effect of therapy was monitored by measuring systolic BP and Uprot (weekly) and structural renal damage at the end of study (week 16).", 
    "552": "During low sodium, GEM effectively reduced Uprot (-48 +/- 4%), but LIS was more effective (-80 +/- 2%), while Uprot slightly increased in VEH (+23 +/- 2%). The focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) score after GEM (38 +/- 14) was lower than in the VEH group (79 +/- 27), although this was not significant. LIS (18 +/- 6) reduced FGS significantly. Remarkably, on high sodium, GEM was completely ineffective in reducing BP, Uprot and structural renal injury, just like LIS.", 
    "553": "The renoprotective actions of VPI depend on dietary sodium intake in normotensive nephrotic rats: therapeutic efficacy is fully blunted by a high sodium diet. During a low sodium diet, gemopatrilat was renoprotective, but less effective than lisinopril. Whether higher doses of the VPI could improve its renoprotective efficacy remains to be elucidated.", 
    "554": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a life threatening disease with an enormous medical requirement. Approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer from CHF. The prevalence will inevitably increase due to the ageing population. Nevertheless, current treatment options based on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists merely slow progression of the disease. Novel treatment concepts based on new therapeutic targets must have the capability to reverse the severity of this disease. This review, focusing on the emerging targets in the most promising therapeutic areas for the treatment of CHF, will be divided into two parts. In Part I, disease concepts such as altered calcium handling and ion channel activity, pathophysiological hypertrophy and inefficient cardiac metabolism are discussed. Validation status and potential therapeutic value for new targets in each research field is given by summarising the results of in vitro and in vivo studies.", 
    "555": "Glomerular mesangial cells play a major role in glomerular hemodynamics, considered also as antigen-presenting cells participating in immune response. Mesangial dysfunction and proliferation are typical lesions of diabetic glomerulopathy. Adenosine, a local hormone, produced by mesangial cells is a metabolic regulator of renal blood flow, capable of decreasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), exerting immunosuppressive, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. Since it was well established that antioxidants confer protection against increased oxidative stress that occurs in diabetes, the effect of captopril, reduced glutathione and melatonin on adenosine metabolism was investigated. Glomerular mesangial cells obtained from collagenase treated glomeruli, isolated from renal cortex of Sprague-Dowley rats, were grown under high glucose conditions (30 mmol/L) as a model of diabetic microenvironment. The activity of adenosine metabolizing enzymes: 5'-nucleotidease (5'-NU) responsible for its production and adenosine deaminase (ADA) responsible for its degradation were investigated. Hyperglycemic conditions led to decreased adenosine production via 5'-NU and decreased removal via ADA. Captopril, given in therapeutic concentration induced enzyme activities in normoglycemic conditions and restored hyperglycemia-induced decrease. In order to investigate if the presence of SH groups may be responsible for this improvement, the cells were exposed to reduced glutathione, and it exerted almost equal effect, given in physiological and higher concentrations. Melatonin increased 5'-NU activity only in physiological glucose conditions. Presented results confirm potential renoprotective effect of SH-group containing antioxidant supplementation during diabetes in restoring adenosine metabolism.", 
    "556": "The aim of the study was assessment of bronchial capacity in the treatment with ACE inhibitors. 92 patients with essential hypertension stage I-II (mean age 52 years), ischemic heart disease and bronchial asthma (a mild, moderate and severe course) in a relative remission were treated for arterial hypertension with ACE inhibitors enalapril and diroton. Enalapril improved cough indices by 38.3%, diroton--by 13.3%. This was accompanied by a rise in the level of natural antibodies to bradikinin.", 
    "557": "190 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were examined: 24 patients with DM type 1 and 166 with DM type 2. Frequency of arterial hypertension (AH) in diabetics is higher than in population. AH in different DM types varies by pathogenesis. Symptomatic renal AH is typical for DM1, essential AH combining with renal one in 1/3 of cases--for DM2. Treatment of AH and DM often provokes hypothyroidism which can be iatrogenic because of continuous intake of sugar reducing and antihypertensive drugs with antithyroid and strumogenic actions. Hypothyroidism aggravates an AH course: arterial pressure becomes high and resistant to hypotensive therapy. DM makes difficulties in selection of hypotensive drugs as many of them alter metabolism and due to negative attitude of the patients to continuous intake of sugar reducing, antihypertensive drugs, thyroid hormones. Therefore, hypertensive diabetics should be prepared for treatment psychologically and receive only prolonged hypotensive drugs. In DM with AH medication of choice is ACE inhibitors as they are nephroprotective, had no negative effect on carbohydrate, fat metabolism and thyroid system.", 
    "558": "The authors reviewed some of the most relevant studies dedicated to the assessment of the effects of the antihypertensive drugs on the stress-induced cardiovascular changes. The rises in both blood pressure and heart rate turned out not to be significantly altered by calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, moxonidine, nor beta-blockers, whereas they seemed to be slightly blunted by alpha-blocking drugs. However, since baseline blood pressure was significantly lower in treated hypertensives than in placebo-given patients, all antihypertensive drugs eventually resulted in a lower blood pressure level during stress, as compared with untreated patients. Regarding white coat effect, which has to be considered as a very particular stress, it appeared to be lowered to the same extent by placebo and antihypertensive drugs; moreover, its changes were not associated with any clinical beneficial effect.", 
    "559": "Of 2,626 patients admitted for acute coronary syndromes and participating in the PREVENIR 1 and 2 registries, 202 (8%) were aged less than 45 years. Younger patients were more often smokers (79% versus 37%), but systemic hypertension and diabetes were less frequent. Reperfusion therapy was more frequently used in the younger patients (63% versus 46%). At hospital discharge, aspirin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were prescribed as often in younger and older patients. In contrast, beta-blocking agents and statins were used more often in the younger patients. More younger patients participated in a cardiac rehabilitation programme. Left ventricular ejection fraction was less altered in the younger age group and none of the younger patients died between hospital discharge and six months follow-up.", 
    "560": "Reflux nephropathy (RN) is the cause of end-stage renal failure in 3%-25% of children and 10%-15% of adults. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I) to the active octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II), a potent vasoconstrictor. ACE is localized in highest concentrations on the luminal surface of endothelial cells, but is also found in several other cell types, including the epithelial cells of the proximal renal tubule. Recent studies have suggested that ACE increases production of the components of extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin (Fib) mediated through Ang II. Since RN is a primary tubulointerstitial disease, we hypothesized that local overexpression of ACE may induce renal fibrosis via up-regulation of Ang II. In this study, we investigated the expression of ACE in severely refluxing kidneys from eight patients (age range 6 months-14 years) with severe RN secondary to primary high-grade vesicoureteral reflux at nephrectomy. Control material included normal kidney specimens obtained from three adult patients during partial nephrectomy for an incidentaloma. Soluble enzyme immunohistochemistry was carried out using polyclonal antibodies to ACE and Fib. In-situ hybridization (ISH) was performed utilizing biotin-labelled antisense oligonucleotide probe. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the relative amount of ACE mRNA. In the refluxing kidney, there was strong ACE immunoreactivity in the glomerulus and proximal tubules and moderate-to-strong immunoreactivity in the distal tubules accompanied by strong Fib immunoreactivity in the glomerulus, proximal tubule, and interstitial space. There was strong ACE mRNA expression in the glomerulus and proximal tubules and moderate expression in the distal tubules. In the control kidneys, homogeneous weak ACE immunoreactivity and mRNA expression was demonstrated only in the proximal tubules. RT-PCR showed strong ACE expression in the refluxing kidneys compared to controls. Up-regulation of ACE in RN accompanied by an increase in ECM in the tubulointerstitial space suggests that ACE is involved in the pathogenesis of the renal parenchymal damage in patients with RN. Pharmacologic blockade of ACE may be helpful in preventing the renal fibrosis associated with RN.",

    "565": "Design and synthesis of metabolically stable peptide analogs that can either mimic or block the bioactivity of natural peptides or enzymes is an important constituent of bioorganic and medicinal chemistry research. Isosteric replacement of a scissile peptide bond represents a viable and popular approach in the rational design of peptidomimetics. Peptidomimetics find applications as drugs, in protein engineering and so on. This is evident from the wealth of therapeutically useful peptidomimetic leads incorporating any of the peptide isosteres that are currently available. In this review, we have given a brief account of the types of peptide isosteres widely known till date. With this background, we have described some of the recent developments in synthetic approaches. This includes methods involving a common intermediate to synthesize different possible isosteres and their peptide analogs, solid phase synthesis and combinatorial approach. One such method involving stereoselective nitrile oxide cycloaddition as the key step has been studied extensively in our research laboratory. Finally, we have also discussed about some of the recent reports on the design and inhibitory activities of peptidic or non-peptidic analogs against aspartic proteases (HIV-1, renin, ACE and pepsin) and peptide analogs of an immunomodulating hexapeptide.", 
    "566": "Saint James' Hospital is a 650-bed tertiary referral hospital. An audit was performed of acute transmural myocardial infarctions for the years 1996 to 1999 inclusive. On average there were 2043 cardiology admissions annually, 9.8% of all hospital admissions. Acute transmural myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 178 patients annually, and was less common during the summer. The figure of 72% receiving revascularisation therapy (thrombolysis 67%, primary angioplasty 5%) compares favourably with 35% in 1992. The main reason for not receiving thrombolysis was late presentation (15%) with contraindications present in only 5%. The case fatality rate was 16% confirming the higher mortality in clinical practice than that of thrombolytic trials. The prescription of aspirin or warfarin (99%) and betablockers (67%) was in line with international trials. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (34%) and statins (28%) is similar to other studies but less than would be expected according to trial evidence.", 
    "567": "We compared the implementation of secondary prevention some 18 months following acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass surgery in Ireland in 1994 to that in 15 European countries, including Ireland, in 2000. While there were substantial improvements in the use of statins, b-blockers and the availability of rehabilitation programmes since the early 1990s, more patients now smoke, take no exercise and are overweight. The prevalence of non-insulin dependent diabetes has increased by 70%. In comparison with other European countries, we have the highest use of aspirin and the highest prevalence of smoking in women. Despite a considerable improvement in the use of drug therapy we will not achieve the full potential of secondary prevention unless lifestyle factors, including smoking, overweight and exercise receive greater attention by patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "568": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Europe. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is among the most common of its manifestations. Women and older patients are under-represented in most trials of treatment for AMI, as are those with significant co-morbidities. These patients also have a worse long term outcome after AMI. We sought to evaluate the management of AMI in a small non-academic general hospital. A review was performed of cases of AMI during 2000. Ninety-two cases were analysed, 69% were male. The mean age was 70 years. In-hospital mortality was 12%; 30-day mortality was 14%. There was no gender or age difference in mortality. Of thirty eligible patients, twenty-eight were thrombolysed (93%). Aspirin (81%) and beta-blocker (41%) prescription on discharge were below published European and American rates. Females were significantly less likely to receive aspirin or beta-blockers on discharge. Those aged 70 years or more were less likely to receive beta-blockers, statins or ACE inhibitors on discharge. Those with co-morbidities were less likely to receive beta-blockers or statins on discharge. This study highlights the difficulty in realising evidence based guidelines optimal management of AMI in clinical practice. While the outcome with regard to mortality is similar to national figures, there is a need to enhance care, with particular emphasis on secondary pharmacological measures prescribed on discharge.",

The number of drugs that have been associated to date with acute pancreatitis exceeds 260. The authors report here on their personal series of four cases of drug-induced acute pancreatitis (warfarin, lysinopril/hydrochlorothiazide, lamivudine/stavudine/indinavir, valproic acid), focusing on a number of epidemiological and clinical aspects.", 
    "570": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular mortality and significant limitation in function because of limb ischemia. Patients with PAD should be considered to have significant coronary and cerebral arterial disease that requires aggressive risk factor management, including the prescription of antiplatelet drugs, to lower the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. In the population with PAD, level 1 and level 2 evidence supports the use of statin drugs for lipid management, angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 inhibitors for blood pressure control, and aspirin or clopidogrel as antiplatelet agents. Once this is accomplished, the severity of limb symptoms should be assessed, and a structured exercise program or the selected use of drugs such as cilostazol to treat claudication should be prescribed. In patients primarily considered for surgical treatment, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug therapy can be used as a means of promoting graft patency, and beta-adrenergic blockers can be used as a means of reducing the perioperative risks associated with vascular surgery.", 
    "571": "We recently reported the novel finding of expression and function of connexin45 (Cx45) in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. We examined the hypothesis that Cx45 is altered in hypertension. Immunoblots for Cx45 showed a significant increase in Cx45 in cerebral arteries from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with adult Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, with no difference in aorta or femoral artery. Patch-clamp of cerebral smooth muscle cells pairs from SHR versus WKY showed a significantly steeper voltage dependence of deactivation and partial block of junctional currents by quinine and by a peptide that interferes with docking of Cx45, consistent with dominance of functional Cx45 channels in SHR. We examined potential roles of blood pressure versus angiotensin in elevated Cx45 in SHR by measuring Cx45 protein in 4 groups: (1) long-term administration in Wistar rats of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME; (2) long-term administration in SHR of the ACE inhibitor captopril; (3) long-term administration in Wistar rats of angiotensin; and (4) exposure of basilar artery segments in organ culture to angiotensin. Blood pressure was significantly elevated in groups 1 and 3 and was normal in group 2. In groups 1, 2, and 4, there was no significant change in Cx45 protein. In group 3, there was a modest but insignificant increase in Cx45 protein but no change in voltage dependence of deactivation of junctional currents. Overall, our data show increased Cx45 in SHR that is unlikely to be due to either elevated blood pressure or to angiotensin. Relative dominance of Cx45 over Cx43 in cerebral vessels may predispose SHR to ischemic stroke.", 
    "572": "Primary aldosteronism is a specifically treatable and potentially curable form of secondary hypertension. The aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) is routinely used as a screening test. Antihypertensive therapy can interfere with the interpretation of this parameter, but a correct washout period can be potentially harmful. We have investigated the effects of therapy with atenolol, amlodipine, doxazosin, fosinopril, and irbesartan on the ARR in a group of 230 patients with suspected primary aldosteronism. The percent change from control of ARR in patients taking amlodipine was -17%+/-32; atenolol, 62%+/-82; doxazosin, -5%+/-26; fosinopril, -30%+/-24; and irbesartan, -43%+/-27. The ARR change induced by atenolol was significantly higher compared with that induced by all other drugs (P<0.0001), and the ARR change induced by irbesartan was significantly lower than that induced by doxazosin (P<0.0001). One of 55 patients from the group taking amlodipine (1.8%) and 4/17 of the patients taking irbesartan (23.5%) gave a false-negative ARR (<50). None of the patients of the groups taking fosinopril, doxazosin, and atenolol displayed a false-negative ARR. Doxazosin and fosinopril can be used in hypertensive patients who need to undergo aldosterone and PRA measurement for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; amlodipine gave a very small percentage of false-negative diagnoses. beta-Blockers also do not interfere with the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, but they can be responsible for an increased rate of false-positive ARRs. The high rate of false-negative diagnoses in patients undergoing irbesartan treatment requires confirmation in a higher number of patients.", 
    "573": "ACE inhibition reduces plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a risk factor for myocardial infarction, whereas the effect of angiotensin receptor antagonism on PAI-1 is uncertain. The present study compares the time course of effects of ACE inhibition and angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonism on morning plasma PAI-1 antigen. Blood pressure and endocrine, metabolic, and fibrinolytic variables were measured in 20 insulin-resistant (defined by fasting glucose >8.3 mmol/L, body mass index >28 kg/m2, or fasting serum triglyceride > or =2.8 mmol/L) hypertensive subjects (mean age, 47.9+/-2.1 years) (1) before and after 1 week of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/d, and (2) before and 1, 3, 4, and 6 weeks after addition of ramipril (escalated to 10 mg/d) or losartan (escalated to 100 mg/d). Hydrochlorothiazide decreased systolic (P=0.011) and diastolic (P=0.019) pressure. Ramipril (from 133.6+/-5.1/94.5+/-2.4 to 127.0+/-3.1/91.4+/-3.3 mm Hg) or losartan (from 137.0+/-3.9/93.1+/-2.9 to 123.7+/-2.6/86.4+/-2.1 mm Hg) further reduced systolic (P=0.009) and diastolic (P=0.037) pressure. The pressure effects of the 2 drugs were similar. Hydrochlorothiazide increased plasma PAI-1 (P=0.013) but not tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (P=0.431) antigen. Addition of either ramipril or losartan significantly decreased plasma PAI-1 antigen (P=0.046). However, the effect of losartan on PAI-1 antigen was not sustained throughout the 6-week treatment period, such that there was a significant drugxtime interaction (P=0.043). tPA antigen decreased during either ramipril or losartan (P=0.032), but tPA activity decreased only during losartan (P=0.018). Short-term interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by either ACE inhibition or AT1 receptor antagonism decreases PAI-1 antigen, but the duration of this effect is greater for ACE inhibition than for AT1 receptor antagonism.", 
    "574": "Reactive oxygen species have an important pathogenic role in organ damage. We investigated the role of oxidative stress via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD[P]H) oxidase in the kidney of the Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats with heart failure (DSHF). Eleven-week-old DS rats fed an 8%-NaCl diet received either vehicle or imidapril (1 mg/kg per day) for 7 weeks. The renal expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase p47phox and endothelial NO synthase were evaluated. In DSHF rats, associated with increased renal angiotensin II, mRNA and protein expression of NAD(P)H oxidase p47phox were enhanced with an increase in renal lipid peroxidation production (0.33+/-0.03 versus 0.22+/-0.01 nmol/mg protein, P<0.05) and urinary excretion of hydrogen peroxide (26.9+/-6.6 versus 9.5+/-2.1 U/mg creatinine, P<0.01) compared with levels in Dahl salt-resistant rats. The endothelial NO synthase expression was decreased in the kidney. Treatment with imidapril reduced renal angiotensin II and NAD(P)H oxidase expression and the oxidative products (kidney lipid peroxidation product: 0.16+/-0.02, P<0.001; urinary hydrogen peroxide: 3.1+/-0.2, P<0.01 versus DSHF rats). Imidapril significantly decreased albuminuria and reduced glomerulosclerosis without changes in the blood pressure. In conclusion, DSHF rats showed increased oxidative stress in the kidney via NAD(P)H oxidase. Blockade of local angiotensin II with subpressor dose of imidapril inhibited NAD(P)H oxidase and prevented renal damage.", 
    "575": "SEVERAL MECHANISMS: The progression in renal failure first implies hemodynamic mechanisms and among which angiotensin II has a central role, but also an increase in proteinuria and the induction of many inflammatory and mitogenic mediators that enhance fibrosis (TGF-beta), an effect stimulating the thrombotic mechanism. Among these factors of progression in renal failure, hypertension and proteinuria are the two major factors. Proteinuria is \"nephrotoxic\" and leads to glomerular and tubulo-interstitial lesions. THE ROLE OF ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) affect the different mechanisms that lead to glomerulosclerosis: antihypertensive effect, with the normalisation of blood pressure having demonstrated its determining role in the production of nephrosis in various epidemiological studies; hemodynamic effect with a decrease in glomerular capillary pressure, in the filtration fraction, and inhibition of the bradykinin deterioration; antiproteinuric effect superior to that of other anti-hypertensive drugs (excepting angiotensin II-receptor antagonists). Two indications ACE inhibitors have demonstrated their efficacy in slowing the progression of renal failure in two large pathological fields: diabetic nephropathy in which this effect is demonstrated in type I diabetes, although the results are not as obvious in type II diabetes in which the nephropathy is multi-factor. The recent French and American recommendations are that ACE inhibitors should be used in first intention in diabetic nephropathies and aimed at tight blood pressure control; non-diabetic nephropathies Two pivotal studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in nephropathies whatever their type. These data have led to propose ACE inhibitors in first intention in patients exhibiting chronic nephropathies, whether hypertensive or not THE COMBINATION WITH OTHER HYPERTENSIVE DRUGS: Calcium channel blockers have a beneficial trophic effect in renoprotection and can be combined with ACE inhibitors, particularly in the case of diabetic nephropathies. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor antagonists have comparable effect on hemodynamics and glomerulosclerosis factors. Clinically, the decrease in proteinuria is identical. Endothelin antagonists have also been studied in renoprotection and appear to have a beneficial effect when combined with ACE inhibitors. GLOBALLY: ACE inhibitors remain the only treatment with demonstrated long-term efficacy in the progression of chronic renal failure. However, the concept of renoprotection needs to be widened to all the factors implied in the progression of chronic renal failure, and ACE inhibitors only represent one aspect of treatment. The role of angiotensin II-receptor antagonists, alone or combined, is clearly promising.", 
    "576": "Aggressive treatment of hypertension is effective in reducing both microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes, and target BP less than 130/85 or 130/80 mmHg are now recommended. Inhibition of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an essential role in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes-related complications. Studies focusing on renal end-points suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are more effective than other traditional agents in reducing the onset of clinical proteinuria in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with incipient nephropathy, mainly in normotensive ones (secondary prevention). However, several small trials in type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy (tertiary prevention) failed to demonstrate a specific renoprotective role for ACE-I, at variance with type 1 diabetes. Three recent large trials address the question of whether angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) prevent the development of clinical proteinuria or delay the progression of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. The IRMA study showed that irbesartan is more effective than conventional therapy in preventing the development of clinical proteinuria and in favoring the regression to normoalbuminuria for comparable BP control in patients with incipient nephropathy. The IDNT and RENAAL trials showed that ARB are more effective than traditional antihypertensive therapies in reducing progression toward end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy independently of changes in BP. Moreover, a reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure was demonstrated for ARB-treated patients compared with placebo. Furthermore, the LIFE study showed that losartan is more effective than conventional therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a cohort of diabetic patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. In conclusion, ARB seem to be effective in both preventing renal damage and reducing progression toward ESRF in type 2 diabetic patients. Thus, the guidelines for the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy are now changed. In type 1 diabetes ACE-I are the first-choice drug; in type 2 diabetes, ARB are considered first-choice drugs in secondary prevention as well as ACE-I and have been now elected the unique first-choice drug in tertiary prevention of ESRF. Finally, ARB should be considered as the first-choice drug in cardiovascular prevention too, as well as ACE-I.", 
    "577": "The most important factor that prevents the progression of renal damage in diabetes mellitus, beside the improvement of blood glucose control, is tight BP control. The tenet of tight BP control may be defined as the lowest BP level one can accomplish using antihypertensive therapy that is at the same time compatible with the absence of untoward side effects. In fact, both the Framingham Heart Study in nondiabetic normal subjects and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study in type 2 diabetic patients showed that systolic values as low as 108 to 111 mmHg and diastolic values as low as 70 to 71 mmHg are significantly associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. However, 45 to 50% of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension have systolic BP levels above 140 mmHg during antihypertensive therapy, particularly when using monotherapy. Thus the issue regarding the choice of which drugs one should use to treat hypertension became critical from a clinical point of view. Pharmaceutical compounds, which inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, have become the first-choice treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus and incipient and advanced renal complications. The present brief review analyzes the effects of calcium channel blockers (CCB) on cardiovascular and renal complications in diabetes mellitus. The review discussed those studies that directly and blindly compared CCB with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and with angiotensin II AT(1) receptor blockers (ARB). Furthermore, size of the population recruited in each trial was used as a criterion of priority in the selection of the reports from the available literature. From the point of view of cardiovascular complications, the results of these studies showed a slightly better benefit of CCB on stroke, whereas ACE inhibitors better prevented the occurrence of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. On the other hand, recent observations demonstrated that also ACE inhibitors and ARB are effective in the primary and secondary prevention of stroke, although these studies did not directly compare these compounds with CCB. With regard to the outcome of renal complications, both ARB and ACE inhibitors more effectively prevented the progression of renal damage among the patients with overt nephropathy than CCB. On the contrary, both CCB and ACE inhibitors were equally effective on blunting the decay of GFR in diabetic patients who do not have overt proteinuria. However, ACE inhibitors and ARB more markedly decreased the rate of albumin excretion rate in the range of both microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of abnormalities of albumin excretion rate and of atherosclerosis are also discussed. Both mechanical stress, mainly secondary to systolic hypertension, and elevated circulating and tissue levels of angiotensin II, partially independent from each other, cause excessive generation of superoxide compounds. This chain reaction of events in turn leads to disorders of structural components of glomerular filter and to damage of the vascular wall. Systolic BP control (<130 mmHg) is not adequately accomplished in the majority of the patients treated only with ACE inhibitors and ARB, even in association with diuretics. Poor BP control may lead to excessive systemic mechanical stress at the vascular level despite satisfactory inhibition of angiotensin II effects. In conclusion, one can suggest that CCB are useful and often indispensable pharmaceutical compounds, beside ACE inhibitors and ARB, to accomplish tight BP control (<130/85 mmHg), a target that is unlikely to be successfully maintained in the overall population of type 2 diabetic patients only by ACE inhibitors or ARB, as monotherapy. However, ACE inhibitors and ARB might be considered first-choice drugs in the treatment of hypertension in diabetes mellitus, mainly because of a better renoprotection.", 
    "578": "Recently published actively controlled outcome trials in hypertension compared conventional therapy (diuretics and beta-blockers) with newer antihypertensive drug classes, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II antagonists. In a quantitative overview of nine trials including 62,605 randomized patients, it was found that conventional therapy and newer drug classes had similar long-term efficacy in preventing cardiovascular complications of hypertension. BP lowering largely accounted for most, if not all, of the observed benefits in cardiovascular outcome. These findings emphasize the desirability of lowering BP as much as possible to maximize the reduction in cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, several clinical trials have been specifically designed to highlight specific mechanisms of action of the newer drugs by measuring intermediate end points, such as carotid intima-media thickening or renal dysfunction, or by studying subgroups of patients with specific disorders, such as diabetes mellitus. In these trials, calcium channel blockers were more effective than conventional therapy in preventing carotid intima-media thickening and mild renal dysfunction, whereas use of calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus in some studies. However, whether or not these specific effects of the newer drugs on intermediary and/or metabolic end points in the long run also lead to fewer cardiovascular complications remains to be proved.", 
    "579": "Some antihypertensive agents may be capable of reducing chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) progression because they halt some of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in renal damage. Although this effect seems to be partially independent of BP reduction, it is still unclear whether these drugs are really superior to other antihypertensive agents when the BP values recommended by the present guidelines are actually achieved. This is particularly true when considering that, in published trials, target and achieved BP values were constantly higher than those nowadays recommended. Furthermore, in the majority of these studies, patients treated with ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ATIIRA) achieved lower BP values than those in control groups and BP values during 24 h were not recorded. Anyway, taking into account the role of baseline and follow-up BP values, the treatment effect remained significant in almost all of the multivariate models. These findings suggest that the renoprotective effect of these agents (ACE-I, ATIIRA) is partially independent of better BP control. However, caution should be paid in attributing true biologic renoprotective properties to drugs just on the basis of statistical adjustments of BP values, although robustly performed, without being aware of what those BP values actually reflect.", 
    "580": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important homeostatic role in BP regulation, water and salt balance, and tissue growth control under physiologic conditions. On the other hand, a pivotal involvement of the RAS in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal disease is extensively supported by both basic and clinical evidence. In particular, it is today recognized that angiotensin II (AngII), the biologic effector of the RAS, may prompt a number of relevant structural and functional abnormalities through the activation of a complex of cellular effects mostly mediated via its binding with the AT(1) subtype receptors. The key role of these AngII-linked mechanisms of disease is strongly corroborated by large interventional studies. In fact, pharmacologic interference with RAS activity, by both preventing AngII formation with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or antagonizing its binding to cell membrane receptors by selective antagonists, is associated with highly beneficial outcomes in major disease conditions (hypertension, diabetes, renal failure, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and others). This article briefly reviews the current views on the biologic organization of RAS evidence supporting a pathogenic role of the RAS activity in promoting cardiac, vascular, and renal disease, and finally provides the basis for considering inhibition of RAS activity a major target for therapeutic interventions in these conditions.", 
    "581": "Chronic diseases of the kidney have a progressive course toward organ failure. Common pathway mechanisms of progressive injury, irrespectively of the etiology of the underlying diseases, include glomerular capillary hypertension and enhanced passage of plasma proteins across the glomerular capillary barrier because of impaired permselective function. These changes are associated with podocyte injury and glomerular sclerosis. Direct evidence for causal roles is lacking, particularly for the link between intraglomerular protein deposition and sclerosing reaction. Because transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is the putative central mediator of scarring, we hypothesized that TGF-beta1 can be up-regulated by protein overload of podocytes thereby contributing to sclerosis. In rats with renal mass reduction, protein accumulation in podocytes as a consequence of enhanced transcapillary passage preceded podocyte dedifferentiation and injury, increase in TGF-beta1 expression in podocytes, and TGF-beta1-dependent activation of mesangial cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prevented both accumulation of plasma proteins and TGF-beta1 overexpression in podocytes and sclerosis. Albumin load on podocytes in vitro caused loss of the synaptopodin differentiation marker and enhanced TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein. Conditioned medium of albumin-stimulated podocytes induced a sclerosing phenotype in mesangial cells, an effect mimicked by TGF-beta1 and blocked by anti-TGF-beta1 antibodies. Thus, the passage of excess plasma proteins across the glomerular capillary wall is the trigger of podocyte dysfunction and of a TGF-beta1-mediated mechanism underlying sclerosis. Agents to reduce TGF-beta1, possibly combined with angiotensin blockade, should have priority in novel approaches to treatment of progressive nephropathies.", 
    "582": "Bisoprolol is a highly selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist. Administration of bisoprolol to patients with chronic heart failure is associated with increases in left ventricular function and reductions in heart rate; increases in heart rate variability are also seen. Two major randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials have examined the clinical efficacy of bisoprolol in combination with ACE inhibitors and diuretics in patients with stable chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV): the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS; n = 641) and CIBIS II (n = 2 647). All-cause mortality (primary endpoint) was significantly lower in bisoprolol than in placebo recipients in CIBIS II (11.8 vs 17.3%) and was reduced by bisoprolol regardless of dosage. All-cause mortality was also lower in CIBIS (16.6 vs 20.9%) although the difference did not achieve statistical significance. In a meta-analysis of CIBIS and CIBIS II (n = 3 288), a relative reduction of 29% in the incidence of all-cause mortality was seen in bisoprolol versus placebo recipients; this analysis also demonstrated that bisoprolol reduces mortality in patients with chronic heart failure regardless of aetiology or severity. In CIBIS II, there were significantly fewer cardiovascular deaths, admissions to hospital for any reason, or cardiovascular deaths or cardiovascular hospitalisations (combined endpoint) in bisoprolol, compared with placebo, recipients (secondary endpoints). Compared with standard treatment alone, the addition of bisoprolol was a cost-effective option in chronic heart failure in UK, French, German and Swedish pharmacoeconomic studies. Bisoprolol is generally well tolerated in patients with chronic heart failure. In CIBIS II, adverse events occurring more commonly in bisoprolol than placebo recipients, regardless of causal relationship with the study medication, included dizziness, bradycardia, hypotension and fatigue. Bisoprolol recipients were less likely than placebo recipients to experience worsening of heart failure, dyspnoea or tachycardia. In both CIBIS and CIBIS II there was no significant difference between bisoprolol and placebo recipients in the incidence of permanent treatment withdrawal. In conclusion, adding the highly selective beta(1)-blocker bisoprolol to a treatment regimen comprising an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic significantly improves survival in patients with stable chronic heart failure and reduces the need for hospitalisation. The use of bisoprolol in this disorder is generally well tolerated and is cost effective. Thus, bisoprolol should be considered a standard treatment option when selecting a beta-blocker for use in combination with ACE inhibitors and diuretics in patients with stable, moderate to severe chronic heart failure.",

Use of a high-salt diet 3-9 weeks after irradiation exacerbated radiation-induced hypertension but attenuated the development of radiation nephropathy. Continuous use of a high-salt diet slowed the progression of radiation nephropathy, but eventually exacerbated radiation-induced hypertension and accelerated renal failure. Use of a high-salt diet in animals with established radiation nephropathy was deleterious. A low-salt diet had no effect on the development of radiation nephropathy.",

The pathophysiological processes particular to the CABG procedure that may affect graft endothelial function are most active in the early phase after surgery. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to be effective in reducing or preventing ischemic events in patients with and without left ventricular dysfunction, and in those at high risk for CAD.

    "594": "The natriuretic peptide and renin-angiotensin systems are physiological counterparts with opposite roles in the regulation of electrolyte balance and blood pressure. In both systems, membrane-bound, zinc-dependent peptidases play an important role in the inactivation or activation of the system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II, and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) degrades the natriuretic peptides. Simultaneous inhibition NEP and ACE by a single molecule (a vasopeptidase inhibitor) is a new therapeutic approach in hypertension. Wider applications for vasopeptidase inhibitors being studied include their role as cardioprotective agents in heart failure, as renoprotective agents in chronic renal failure and diabetic nephropathy, and as vasculoprotective agents in endothelial dysfunction and athersclerosis.",

    "605": "Angioedema is a well-known side effect of treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and one that we have been willing to accept in view of the incidence of the problem and the clear benefits of this class of agents in numerous clinical situations. Angioedema is also seen with angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy but much less frequently than with ACE inhibitors. The mechanism for angioedema with ARB therapy remains poorly defined. ACE inhibitor-related angioedema occurs more commonly in black patients. The basis for an increased risk of angioedema in black patients remains unclear. Angioedema can be life-threatening but more times than not it can be managed with conservative treatment measures including specifically the discontinuation of the medication and/or administration of an antihistamine and/or epinephrine. Occasionally, maneuvers to protect the integrity of the airway may be needed. In a heart failure patient having previously experienced ACE inhibitor-related angioedema, ARBs should be used cautiously since angioedema has been reported with ARB therapy in heart failure patients. The need to reduce renin-angiotensin aldosterone system activity in a heart failure patient would seem to justify the small risk of angioedema with ARB therapy in a patient having previously experienced ACE inhibitor-related angioedema.", 
    "606": "Numerous hypertension treatment trials have been reported during the past several years. In comparative studies it has been shown that the use of diuretics or diuretics/beta blockers has resulted in a reduction in morbidity/mortality equivalent to the use of other antihypertensive medications. This is true in both young and elderly patients. In one large 8-year study in diabetics, the use of a beta blocker/diuretic combination was shown to be as effective in reducing overall cardiovascular events as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/diuretic treatment program. Although most data indicate that the degree of blood pressure lowering accounts for most of the benefit, there are some differences in outcome that may be explained by different mechanisms of drug action. For example: 1) diuretics are more effective in preventing heart failure and overall cardiovascular events than alpha blockers; 2) an ACE inhibitor-based program is more effective in the elderly in reducing myocardial infarctions and heart failure than a calcium channel blocker-based program; and 3) a nondihydropyridine is more effective in reducing strokes, but less effective in preventing myocardial infarctions or heart failure, than a program based on diuretic therapy. There is also abundant evidence that the use of ACE inhibitors may prevent the occurrence of diabetes in hypertensive individuals and will reduce cardiovascular events in diabetics. Finally, the angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to slow the progression of renal disease and prevent the occurrence of end-stage renal disease when compared to treatment regimens that do not include an angiotensin receptor blocker or ACE inhibitor. Updated treatment recommendations should include an ACE inhibitor and possibly an angiotensin receptor blocker along with diuretics and beta blockers as initial therapy. In addition, recommendations for the use of multiple-drug therapy have been reinforced by recent trials. Goal pressures are not readily achieved with monotherapy, especially in high-risk patients.",

Drugs that interrupt the RAAS do so by several diverse mechanisms but it remains to be fully proved whether these mechanistic differences are associated with meaningful differences in clinical outcomes. This review summarizes current information about the basic mechanisms of action of three classes of anti-RAAS drugs: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, combined ACE-neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor antagonists as well as results of major clinical outcome trials with these agents. Basic and clinical science information is then blended with insights from the clinical pharmacology of anti-RAAS drugs to address four current controversies in clinical medicine: whether ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists are interchangeable, optimal dosing of available agents, potential justification of ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor antagonist combinations, and first-line use of anti-RAAS drugs in antihypertensive therapy.",

No adequately powered, long-term trials have tested their effects to reduce the incidence of hard end points, such as progression to end-stage renal disease or even doubling of serum creatinine in the population of patients with nephropathy from type 2 diabetes. While the results of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trials from nondiabetic causes and even type 1 diabetes may be extrapolated to the patient with nephropathy associated with type 2 diabetes, the hard evidence is not available. This review critically evaluates the limited evidence in support of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as renal-protective agents in people with type 2 diabetes.",

Systolic blood pressure is more difficult to control than diastolic blood pressure, and at least two antihypertensive medications are required for most patients to achieve blood pressure control. It is likely that the majority of people with hypertension could achieve a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg with the antihypertensive medications available today.", 
    "618": "Although vascular compliance, deltaV/deltaP, is abnormal in essential hypertension and can be improved by antihypertensive drug therapy, it is not clear whether drug-induced changes in compliance are attributable solely to lower achieved blood pressure (BP), and thus equally likely with different drugs possessing similar antihypertensive efficacy. Therefore, we used computerized arterial pulse waveform analysis (CAPWA) to measure capacitive (C1) and oscillatory (C2) components of arterial compliance in essential hypertensive subjects (n = 39) before, and 1 and 3 months after achieving normotensive BP values with administration of either dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (CaBl, n = 11), converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI, n = 9), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB, n = 9), or beta-blockers (BBl, n = 10). Despite equivalent effects on BP (CABL: -19 +/- 4/-15 +/- 2 mm Hg; CEI: -12 +/- 3/-13 +/- 2 mm Hg; ARB: -10 +/- 3/-12 +/- 2 mm Hg; and BBl: -14 +/- 3/-12 +/- 2 mm Hg; P <.005 for each drug v pretreatment), CaBl, CEI, and ARB significantly increased arterial compliance (CaBl: %deltaC1 = 30.0 +/- 5.8, %Delta C2 = 43.7 +/- 23.3; CEI: %deltaC1 = 32.7 +/- 5.4, %deltaC2 = 26.7 +/- 7.1; ARB: %deltaC1 = 36.3 +/- 11.8, %deltaC2 = 43.6 +/- 23.1; P <.01 for CaBl, CEI, and ARB v pretreatment), but BBl did not (%deltaC1 = -3.9 +/- 7.6, %deltaC2 = -7.0 +/- 11.5, P = not significant v pretreatment, sig = 0.01 v other drugs). We conclude that for an equivalent effect on BP, arterial compliance improves after therapy with some, but not all antihypertensive drugs. We hypothesize that a greater clinical benefit may result from the preferential use of drugs that concomitantly improve arterial compliance.",

All three treatments provided a significant decrease in UAE during the 48-month study period. However, this effect was more pronounced and became evident earlier with fosinopril than with amlodipine monotherapy (after 3 v 18 months of therapy). In addition, the combination therapy provided a greater antialbuminuric effect than the single drugs. This could be due to the greater antihypertensive effects, although other drug-specific effects cannot be excluded. The cardiovascular outcomes were similar in the amlodipine and in the fosinopril group, but they were lower in the combination group.",

Primary (unassisted survival) and secondary vascular access patency (assisted survival) were modeled using Cox regression (time to failure) adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index, incidence to end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, valvular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aortic aneurysm, deep-vein thrombosis, number of previous permanent accesses, and facility-clustering effects.

These biological actions of NO make it an important component in the endogenous defense against atherosclerosis and its overt clinical complications. Loss of the functional integrity of the endothelium, as seen commonly in the milieu of cardiovascular risk factors, plays an integral role in all stages of atherosclerosis from lesion initiation to plaque rupture. A number of established techniques can assess endothelial function in human vascular beds. The outcome of endothelial testing has profound prognostic implications and is an independent predictor of atherosclerosis disease progression and cardiovascular event rates. The large clinical benefit of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with atherosclerosis involves favorable effects of endothelial function. Studies of endothelial function represent a prime example of a successful application of insights derived from vascular biology at the bedside.",

Combined cardiovascular disease risk was significantly increased in the doxazosin arm compared to the chlorthalidone arm (RR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17-1.33; P <.001), with a doubling of heart failure (fatal, hospitalized, or non-hospitalized but treated) (RR 2.04; 95% CI, 1.79-2.32; P <.001). Questions about heart failure diagnostic criteria led to steps to validate these events further. METHODS AND RESULTS: Baseline characteristics (age, race, sex, blood pressure) did not differ significantly between treatment groups (P <.05) for participants with heart failure events. Post-event pharmacologic management was similar in both groups and generally conformed to accepted heart failure therapy. Central review of a small sample of cases showed high adherence to ALLHAT heart failure criteria. Of 105 participants with quantitative ejection fraction measurements provided, (67% by echocardiogram, 31% by catheterization), 29/46 (63%) from the chlorthalidone group and 41/59 (70%) from the doxazosin group were at or below 40%. Two-year heart failure case-fatalities (22% and 19% in the doxazosin and chlorthalidone groups, respectively) were as expected and did not differ significantly (RR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.67-1.38; P = 0.83). CONCLUSION: Results of the validation process supported findings of increased heart failure in the ALLHAT doxazosin treatment arm compared to the chlorthalidone treatment arm.",

Because a free solution capillary electrophoresis system did not achieve a complete separation of these eight compounds in one run, the usefulness of alkylsulphonates as ion-pairing agents was investigated. After preliminary investigations to determine the experimental domain and the most important factors, a three-level full-factorial design was applied to study the impact of the pH and the molarity of the ion-pairing agent on the separation. Improved separations were obtained suggesting a favourable effect of ion-pairing interactions between analytes and the additive; however, it remained impossible to separate them all in one run.

In the present study, the inhibitory effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, on the peritoneal fibrosis was examined in an experimental EPS model in mice. C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n=20) mice received daily intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 ml of SH solution which consists of 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate and 15% ethanol dissolved in saline. Group 2 (n=20) and group 3 (n=20) mice received SH solution by the same manner of group 1 mice, and were given orally 1 or 3 mg kg(-1) of quinapril, respectively, on daily basis. Five mice from each group were sacrificed on day 3, 7, 21, and 56, and evaluated macroscopically and histologically. Macroscopic examination revealed that fibrotic change in parietal peritoneum in group 1 was more severe than in group 2 and 3, accompanied with statistical significance. Histological examination demonstrated that peritoneal thickening in group 2 and 3 were markedly ameliorated than in group 1. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that histological fibrotic score was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 and 3. These results suggest that quinapril ameliorate the fibrotic change in parietal peritoneum in experimental EPS model in mice, and may have a clinical utility for the prevention of EPS.",

    "644": "Many studies conducted in the last two decades have aroused interest in the role of glomerular hyperfiltration in the pathogenesis of renal damage in hypertension. Glomerular hyperfiltration has been mainly attributed to intraglomerular hypertension and overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system, but not much is known about the role of excessive renal proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption, which may activate tubuloglomerular feedback and increase glomerular filtration. Therefore, we evaluated the relationships between glomerular hemodynamics, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration, proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption, assessed by renal Li+ reabsorption, and sodium-lithium exchange (NLE) in circulating erythrocytes ex vivo, a marker of increased protein expression of isoform 3 of the sodium-proton exchanger (NHE-3) in the proximal tubule, in essential hypertensive patients.",

ACEI reduced GFR and its change was negatively correlated with pretreatment GFR and NLE and positively with the change of proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption. After ACEI, ANP increased in patients with normal NLE but not in those with high NLE (p<0.001 for the difference).",

The groups were homologous for NYHA class and instrumental echographic parameters (mean EF=22.5+/-6.7 and mean sAPP 38.4+/-8.7). At the beginning and after 3 weeks of therapy, we performed a clinical and instrumental assessment; we studied endothelial function by determination of L-arginine and L-citrulline (amino acids of the nitric oxide metabolic pathway), the L-citrulline/L-arginine ratio (an index of NOS activity) and VCAM-1 (endothelial dysfunction index); haemorheological parameters (blood viscosity, plasma fibrinogen and erythrocyte morphology); coagulative/fibrinolytic parameters (PT, aPTT, fibrinogen and PAI-1). The results show that L-citrulline and L-arginine increase, while VCAM-1 decreases. The L-citrulline/L-arginine ratio increases in a statistically significant way. This trend is maintained in each group. These results demonstrate that the drugs used induce an improvement of endothelium-dependent dilatation. In addition, there is progressive haemorheological and fibrinolytic improvement, with a reduction of PAI-1 and blood viscosity.",

A few general practitioners mentioned that they diagnosed heart failure with a trial of diuretics. Obstacles to diagnosis were mentioned by most general practitioners and included lack of facilities for appropriate investigations (especially echocardiography) and lack of time and expertise. Obstacles to management included lack of time, high cost of drugs, difficulty with diagnosis, selection bias towards younger patients and not having the confidence to initiate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Many general practitioners were unaware of the impact angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can have on morbidity and mortality.",

Specific implementation strategies need to be tailored to overcome these obstacles.", 
    "658": "One of the essential requirements even in the most ancient life forms is to be able to preserve body fluid medium. In line with such requirement, animals need to perform different behaviors to cope with water shortages. As angiotensin II (ANGII) is involved on a widespread range of functions in vertebrates, including memory modulation, an integrative role, in response to an environmental water shortage, has been envisioned. Previous work on the semi-terrestrial and brackish-water crab Chasmagnathus granulatus showed that endogenous ANGII enhanced an associative long-term memory and, in addition, that high salinity environment induces both an increase of brain ANGII levels and memory improvement. Here, we show that in the crab Chasmagnathus air exposure transiently increases blood sodium concentration, significantly increases brain ANGII immunoreactivity, and has a facilitatory effect on memory that is abolished by a non-selective ANGII receptor antagonist, saralasin. Furthermore, Rel/NF-kappaB, a transcription factor activated by ANGII in mammals and during memory consolidation in Chasmagnathus brain, is induced in the crab's brain by air exposure. Moreover, nuclear brain NF-kappaB is activated by ANGII, and this effect is reversed by saralasin. Our results constitute the first demonstration in an invertebrate that cognitive functions are modulated by an environmental stimulus through a neuropeptide and give evolutionary support to the role of angiotensins in memory processes. Moreover, these results suggest that angiotensinergic system is preserved across evolution not only in its structure and molecular mechanisms, but also in its capability of coordinating specific adaptative responses.",

Laboratory results demonstrated a normal antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus titers were negative for recent infection. There were no signs of systemic infection; the white blood cell count was normal and blood and urine cultures were negative. Renal ultrasound showed hyperechoic renal cortices with no obstruction.

    "663": "Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) was estimated by the magnitude of depressor response after ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium bromide (C6; 25 mg/kg weight). The depressor effects of C6 were significantly less in borderline-hypertensive Hiroshima rats (BHR) than in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats (DOCA rats) or in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), but they were not different in BHR and normotensive control Wistar rats (NCR). After sympatho-inhibition, the depressor effects of a selective vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist (V1A; 10 microg/kg: [d(CH2)5(1), O-Me-Tyr2, Arg8]-vasopressin) were significantly greater in BHR than in DOCA rats, SHR or NCR. In a previous study, we reported that the depressor effects of C6 were significantly less in BHR than in SHR, but after sympatho-inhibition, the depressor effects of V1A were significantly greater in BHR than in SHR (Hypertens Res 2002; 25: 241-248). After high-salt diet loading in the present study (8% salt-containing diet for 10 weeks), the magnitudes of increase in mean arterial pressure in BHR and NCR were almost the same. There was almost no difference in the depressor effects of V1A after sympatho-inhibition between BHR with high-salt intake and BHR without high-salt intake. The depressor effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (1 mg/kg), were almost the same between BHR and NCR both before and after sympatho-inhibition. However, these effects were completely inhibited after the high-salt diet. The results show that SNA was within the normal range in BHR and that no further accelerated responsiveness of endogenous vasopressin was observed in BHR after high-salt intake.",

According to the guidelines for the management of hypertensive patients in Japan in 2000 (JSH-2000), only 41.5% of the subjects achieved the target blood pressure, with a mean systolic blood pressure of 140.0+/-14.9 mmHg and a mean diastolic blood pressure of 80.0+/-10.7 mmHg. There were no differences between patients with and without concurrent disease or among age groups (<60, 60-69, 70-79, and 80 years and over) in systolic blood pressure levels achieved. However, the diastolic blood pressure decreased with age, indicating an increase of the pulse pressure. Overall, the prescription rates were: calcium channel blockers (CCBs), 73.0%; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), 31.3%; angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 18.9%; beta-blockers, 16.2%; and diuretics, 10.1%. Although some selection of antihypertensive drugs was based on evidence from previous trials on hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure and renal insufficiency, overall, CCBs were selected in all age groups and in all comorbid conditions. In conclusion, Japanese cardiologists do not appear to consider age and comorbidity when choosing antihypertensive managements. Based on current evidence, the management of hypertension should be individualized, with the blood pressure target level and antihypertensive medications chosen on the basis of age and comorbidity.", 
    "665": "The efficacy of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) in the treatment of chronic heart failures is well documented. However, ACEIs may provide incomplete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) because of the alternative pathways for angiotensin II (All) production. We hypothesized that more complete blockade of RAS by adding an AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) may have greater potential to decrease mortality associated with heart failure and improve cardiac function than monotherapy with ACEIs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined therapy on cardiac functions and survival in cardiomyopathic hamsters. Male cardiomyopathic hamsters (BIO TO2) were administered either placebo (group C), enalapril (30 mg/kg/day) (group E), or enalapril (30 mg/kg/day) + valsartan (500 mg/ kg/day) (group EV), starting at the age of 6 weeks. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the differences in survival. Cardiac functions were evaluated by echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization. Group EV showed significant increases in fractional shortening, LV dP/dTmax, and deceleration time, and showed significant decreases in left ventricular diastolic dimension, LV dP/dTmin, and early diastolic mitral velocity/atrial systolic velocity. Treatment with enalapril resulted in longer survival compared with placebo. Moreover, life expectancy (median probability of survival: 433 days) increased significantly in group EV compared with group E (P<0.05) as well as group C (P<0.001). It is concluded that combined therapy improved cardiac function and survival compared to placebo or enalapril monotherapy.", 
    "666": "Single-drug treatment of essential hypertension (HT) is often insufficient to normalize blood pressure (BP), and high doses of antihypertensive agents can have adverse effects on glucose tolerance (GT) and insulin sensitivity. This study tested whether aggressive BP lowering with combination treatment had any influence on GT or insulin action. In all, 29 nonobese (body mass index [BMI], <30 kg/m ), normolipidemic patients with established HT (159 +/- 3/99 +/- 1 mm Hg) but normal GT were recruited. Eleven normotensive (125 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mm Hg) subjects were matched to the patients for both anthropometric and metabolic variables. Following baseline studies (serum lipid profile, oral GT, insulin release, and insulin sensitivity assessed by the insulin clamp technique), patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to two combination regimens (verapamil 180 mg/day + trandolapril 2 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day + nifedipine 20 mg/day) and restudied 3 months later. Blood pressure was normalized in both groups (with decrements of 25 +/- 5/17 +/- 2 and 29 +/- 3/15 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively). Lipid profile, GT, insulin release, and insulin sensitivity of both glucose uptake and lipolysis were unchanged following both treatments. The authors conclude that in nonobese, normolipidemic, glucose-tolerant hypertensive patients, BP normalization with combination therapy is feasible at no cost in terms of undesired effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity.", 
    "667": "To investigate the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, peridopril, and the beta-adrenergic blocker, metoprolol, on plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY), and NPY receptors in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), both strains of rats were fed with different doses of the drugs (peridopril or metoprolol) for 7 days to get the optimal dosages. After that, 18 male SHR and 18 male age-matched WKY rats were divided into three groups: control, peridopril (2mg/kg/day) and metoprolol (2mg/kg/day). After two months of treatment, VSMCs were isolated from the media layer of the aortic wall. Results showed that the SHRs had higher plasma concentrations and binding sites/affinity for NPY as compared to WKY rats. Peridopril dose-dependently decreased plasma NPY concentrations in WKY rats, and the absolute changes of plasma NPY were greater in SHRs than in WKY rats. Metoprolol showed none of these changes. Metoprolol decreased while peridopril increased NPY binding sites/affinity in SHRs. This indicated that lowered plasma NPY concentration and decreased NPY receptor in VSMCs, might play some roles in the anti-hypertensive mechanisms mediated by ACE inhibitor and beta-adrenergic blockers.", 
    "668": "An analytical method for the determination of benazepril and its active metabolite, benazeprilat, in human plasma by capillary gas chromatography-mass-selective detection, with their respective labelled internal standard, was developed and validated according to international regulatory requirements. After addition of the internal standards, the compounds were extracted from plasma by solid-phase extraction using automated 96-well plate technology. After elution, the compounds were converted into their methyl ester derivatives by means of a safe and stable diazomethane derivative. The methyl ester derivatives were determined by gas chromatography using a mass-selective detector at m/z 365 for benazepril and benazeprilat and m/z 370 for the internal standards. Intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were found to be suitable over the range of concentrations between 2.50 and 1000 ng/mL.", 
    "669": "This open-labeled single-blinded study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of telmisartan in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. Each patient was assigned to take a placebo for 4 weeks followed by once daily-titrated telmisartan (40-80 mg) for 8 weeks. \"Office BP\" and \"24-hour ambulatory BP\" measurements (24-h ABPM) were recorded as scheduled. Thirty-one patients (10 males: 21 females) with a mean age of 48.1 years were enrolled. The final SBP/DBP reductions of 14.6 +/- 14.2/9.9 +/- 6.2 mm Hg were obtained. Full response defined as office DBP reduction of > or = 10 mm Hg from baseline and/or DBP < 90 mm Hg was achieved in 73.3 per cent of cases. Excluding 5 cases of white coat HT diagnosed by 24-h ABPM, full response rate (DBP reduction of > or = 10 mm Hg from baseline and/or < 85 mm Hg) was 76 per cent. Trough to peak ratio and smoothness index for SBP/DBP were highly acceptable (0.75/0.76 and 0.97/1.01, respectively). There were 4 cases of adverse events (2 cases of dizziness, 1 case of headache, and 1 case of acute myocardial infarction).", 
    "670": "Whereas the earlier conceptual targets of heart failure therapy, such as the cardio-renal and hemodynamic models, all fulfilled the basic needs of symptomatic relief and hemodynamic improvement, only the neurohormonal model has provided an effective target to address symptom relief in concert with survival benefits. Recent data allude to a disease-modifying effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) in retarding the new development of heart failure in high-risk populations. Angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) have not been demonstrated to be superior to ACE-Is and their value in achieving incremental benefits in addition to ACE-Is is limited to scenarios in which beta-adrenergic receptor blocker therapy is not applicable. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in addition to ACE inhibition offers incremental benefits that are achieved early and are beneficial in most stages of severity except in the presence of overt decompensation. Unlike ACE-Is, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers cannot be construed as a class but are heterogeneous in their therapeutic response.", 
    "671": "There is a greater choice of drug classes for hypertension than most other diseases, increasing paradoxically the difficulty of finding the right drug for individual patients. Systematic drug rotation studies have shown that the rank order of response to different drugs varies substantially among patients. However, two broad patterns of response emerge, named after the initials of the major drug classes. The AB pattern is seen in Type 1 (high-renin) hypertensives. These are younger Caucasians who respond best to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin blockers and beta-blockers. The CD pattern is seen in Type 2 (low-renin) patients. These are Afro-Caribbeans and older Caucasians, who respond best to calcium blockers and diuretics. This relative homogeneity of phenotype at each age group contrasts with a large heterogeneity of genotype on recent genome-wide scans, and suggests that most hypertension is due to interaction among multiple minor genetic variants. Genotype is unlikely therefore to be useful in selecting treatment for most patients. The exception is patients who have the atypical phenotype for their age, illustrated by the rare Na+ dependent monogenic syndromes of the young.", 
    "672": "Several clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of hypertension are available. The quality of these guidelines varies and the basis for their conclusions is often not clear. We have used systematic and explicit methods in the development of a new set of recommendations. This is the second of three articles describing these guidelines.", 
    "673": "Evidence was found by a systematic search in databases and reference lists in guidelines and articles. A set of recommendations was prepared based on a critical appraisal of the literature. These were revised through discussions with a panel of physicians, and agreed upon after several iterations. The guidelines were circulated to professional, governmental and patient organisations.", 
    "674": "Thiazides should be first-choice drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension. Beta-blockers are a reasonable second choice. The treatment goal should be below 140/90 mm Hg. For combination therapy, thiazides and beta-blockers should be first choice. Diabetic patients should be treated aggressively with a diastolic blood pressure goal below 80 mm Hg. Angiotensin-II antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors should be first choice drugs for diabetics with microalbuminuria. Patients with hypercholesterolaemia are not given a particular recommendation for choice of drug. Patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should choose other drugs than beta-blockers. Thiazides should be avoided if the patient has, or has had, gout.", 
    "675": "Only a few studies have evaluated the efficacy of alpha-blocking agents in combination with other classes of antihypertensive agents, especially in patients not adequately controlled by monotherapy. As alpha-blockers have an additional beneficial effect on serum lipids, it seems reasonable to use them instead of beta-blockers or diuretics in insufficiently treated hypertensive patients with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "676": "All patients with insufficient blood pressure control with either a calcium channel blocker or an ACE inhibitor and evidence of hyperlipidemia (total serum cholesterol > 5.69 mmol/L) were included into an open, randomized and prospective study to evaluate the effects of terazosin and atenolol on lipid profile in hypertensive patients. The patients received either terazosin (n = 26; dose 1 to 10 mg) or atenolol (n = 28; dose 25 to 100 mg). Blood pressure was assessed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement and serum lipids were evaluated at the time of inclusion and 12 weeks later.", 
    "677": "Blood pressure was similar after 12 weeks of treatment (atenolol: 129 (9)/75 (7) mm Hg; terazosin: 128 (11)/75 (9) mm Hg) and total cholesterol was significantly reduced after 12 weeks of treatment (atenolol: Diff 0-12 weeks: 7.29 (1.32) versus 6.62 (1.14 mmol/L, p = 0.006; terazosin: 7.34 (0.93) versus 6.67 (0.85) mmol/L, p = 0.002). In the terazosin group, HDL-cholesterol increased and triglycerides decreased significantly (Diff 0-12 weeks: HDL-chol: 1.55 (0.31) versus 1.63 (0.44) mmol/L, p = 0.04; TG: 1.93 (1.17) versus 1.34 (0.64) mmol/L, p = 0.03). Comparing both groups a significant difference was found with regard to HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides (atenolol versus terazosin: HDL-chol: -0.05 (0.12) versus +0.08 (0.1) mmol/L, p = 0.04; TG: -0.18 (0.61) versus--0.59 (0.6), p = 0.03).", 
    "678": "The alpha-blocker terazosin is as effective as atenolol when combined with either an ACE inhibitor or a calcium-channel blocker as a part of a multidrug regimen to achieve sufficient blood pressure control. In addition, terazosin is superior to atenolol with regard to the effect on the lipid profile of hypertensive and hyperlipidemic patients and seems therefore a reasonable alternative to beta-blockers in hypertensive patients with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "679": "Outcomes for heart failure have improved considerably with the implementation of neurohormonal antagonism that includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Despite the robust benefit of beta-blockers for heart failure, it is not clear that the benefit can be extended to all patient groups. Special clinical consideration thus needs to be given to the elderly, women, and African Americans. A retrospective review of available data suggests that despite differences in the natural history of heart failure for these groups, significant benefit can still be expected from the use of beta-blockers for heart failure. Future trials will address these groups in a prospective manner.", 
    "680": "Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been shown to improve survival and well-being of patients with mild to moderate heart failure. In more advanced heart failure, the relationship between the short-term hemodynamic support afforded by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the harm that results from excess sympathetic activation is more complex. Not all studies of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or antiadrenergic therapy have shown benefit. The Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial has revealed that the combined nonselective beta-adrenergic and a-adrenergic receptor blocking drug carvedilol produces an important salutary effect on the natural history of advanced heart failure. Mortality was reduced by 35% in the carvedilol group, from an annual (Kaplan-Meier) rate of 18.5% to 11.4%. All-cause hospitalizations were reduced by 20% and hospitalization from heart failure by 33%. Even amongst the subgroups at highest risk, no subpopulation could be identified that did not appear to benefit. The trial supports extending the population of those with chronic heart failure who should be routinely treated with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs (in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition therapy) to patients with more advanced disease.", 
    "681": "Chronic heart failure continues to increase in incidence and prevalence despite many pharmacologic advances over the previous decade. Morbidity and mortality remain high, with the number of hospitalizations for worsening heart failure in 1999 approaching 1 million. In addition to investigation of new therapies for the treatment of heart failure, attention must be placed on identifying effective methods for increasing the adoption of proven therapies. First, the potential barriers to implementation of evidence-based medicine must be recognized. Subsequently, strategies to overcome such barriers can be developed. Published guidelines may be helpful in educating practitioners on current standards of care. Other tools may also be considered, and testing the influence of such tools on the implementation of optimal therapy may help the scientific community better understand the factors that influence decision-making among clinicians.", 
    "682": "Approximately 6 million Americans have combined chronic cardiovascular and kidney disease. This clinical intersection presents unique risks to the patient and unique challenges to the clinician. Observational studies have provided quantitative methods for estimating the risk of acute renal failure in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention and bypass surgery procedures. Fortunately, for the general cardiovascular population these risks are small. On the other hand, patients with chronic kidney disease have increased risks of accelerated atherosclerosis, nonfatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac death. Chronic kidney disease presents difficult scenarios in using conventional cardioprotective therapy. However, there are increasing bodies of evidence to suggest the kidney and the heart can be targeted with lines of therapy, specifically with renin-angiotensin system antagonism, that benefit both systems with respect to reduction in the progression of disease, and the prevention of hard kidney and cardiac endpoints. This article will focus on the cardiorenal intersection and highlight innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies concerning this high-risk patient group.", 
    "683": "Low compliance is suspected as a major reason for treatment failure in hypertensive patients. To identify patients with low compliance at the commencement of antihypertensive treatment, the compliance praxis survey (COMPASS) was utilised. A total of 161 physicians identified 2389 hypertensive patients treated by ACE-inhibitor. The physicians rated the compliance of the patients at baseline and at 6-month follow-up prospectively. Standard care was given. The mean age of patients was 64.5 years (54.4% women). The baseline overall score of compliance was medium to high in 97.3% of patients. A quarter of all patients (24.7%) were described as having difficulties to follow lifestyle changes, 22.3% lacked sufficient social support, and 31.0% were unwilling to obtain additional information about illness and treatment. Patients who had received prior treatment for cardiovascular disease were less compliant than those who received first treatment within this study (P=0.05). Younger (P<0.01), male patients (P<0.01), and those without prior cardiovascular disease (P<0.001) were significantly more likely to stop the antihypertensive treatment without a doctor's recommendation. Doctors' rating of compliance at baseline correlated well with ongoing treatment at 6-month follow-up. In conclusion, the COMPASS survey questionnaire is a useful instrument for doctors to differentiate between patients who lack resources and to then counsel patients based on their individual needs.", 
    "684": "Previous studies have reported that pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, attenuates experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. This study hypothesized that pentoxifylline could also attenuate the renal disease progression in rats with remnant kidney. After 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy, rats developed progressively elevated proteinuria and plasma creatinine, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis, all of which were attenuated by 40 to 60% by pentoxifylline. However, the elevated BP was not changed by pentoxifylline. Pentoxifylline reduced the upregulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene by 60% in the cortex of remnant kidney, as well as in a dose-dependent manner in the albumin- or angiotensin II-stimulated proximal tubular cells. It also reduced the upregulation of mitogenic and profibrogenic genes by 50%, including platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2, transforming growth factor-beta(1), connective tissue growth factor, and types I and III collagen in the cortex of remnant kidney. Furthermore, pentoxifylline was found to decrease the numbers of interstitial myofibroblasts by 60% in the cortex of remnant kidney and suppress the proliferation of cultured interstitial fibroblasts. It also reduced the angiotensin II-induced or transforming growth factor-beta(1)-induced expression of connective tissue growth factor gene in cultured fibroblasts and mesangial cells. Combining pentoxifylline with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril, almost completely attenuated the renal disease progression in rats with remnant kidney. In conclusion, pentoxifylline alone can attenuate the chronic renal disease progression. Its combination with cilazapril has the potential to prevent the renal disease progression almost completely.", 
    "685": "The current therapy for chronic proteinuric nephropathies is angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), which slow, but may not halt, the progression of disease, and which may be not effective to the same degree in all patients. In accelerated passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), this study assessed the effect of combining ACEi with angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AIIRA) and with statin that, besides lowering cholesterol, influences inflammatory and fibrogenic processes. Uninephrectomized PHN rats were divided into four groups (n = 10 each) and daily given oral doses of the following: vehicle; 40 mg/L lisinopril; 100 mg/L lisinopril plus L-158,809; 0.3 mg/kg lisinopril plus L-158,809 plus cerivastatin. Treatments started at 2 mo when rats had massive proteinuria and signs of renal injury and lasted until 10 mo. Increases in BP were equally lowered by treatments. ACEi kept proteinuria at levels comparable to pretreatment and numerically lower than vehicle. The addition of AIIRA to lisinopril was more effective, being proteinuria reduced below pretreatment values and significantly lower than vehicle. When cerivastatin was added on top of ACE inhibition and AIIR blockade, urinary protein regressed to normal values and renal failure was prevented. Renal ACE activity was increased threefold in PHN, it was inhibited by more than 60% after ACEi, and decreased below control values with triple therapy. Cerivastatin inhibited ACE activity by 30%. Glomerulosclerosis, tubular damage and interstitial inflammation were ameliorated by ACEi alone or combined with AIIRA, and prevented by addition of statin. TGF-beta(1) mRNA upregulation in PHN kidney was partially reduced after ACEi or combined with AIIRA and almost normalized after adding statin. Cerivastatin inhibited TGF-beta(1) gene upregulation by 25%. These data suggest a possible future strategy to induce remission of proteinuria, lessen renal injury, and protect from loss of function in those patients who do not fully respond to ACEi therapy.", 
    "686": "In this study, a murine model of granulomatous experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (G-EAT) was used to determine the role of TGFbeta1 in fibrosis initiated by an autoimmune inflammatory response. The fibrotic process was evaluated by staining thyroid tissue for collagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin, TGFbeta1, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and measuring serum thyroxine in mice given anti-TGFbeta1 or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The role of particular inflammatory cells in fibrosis was tested by depletion experiments, and the cytokine profile in thyroids was examined by RT-PCR. Neutralization of TGFbeta1 by anti-TGFbeta1 or lisinopril resulted in less collagen deposition and less accumulation of myofibroblasts, and levels of active TGFbeta1 and ACE were reduced in thyroids of treated mice compared with those of untreated controls. Other profibrotic molecules, such as platelet-derived growth factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and IL-13, were also reduced in thyroids of anti-TGFbeta1- and lisinopril-treated mice compared with those of controls. Confocal microscopy showed that CD4(+) T cells and macrophages expressed TGFbeta1. Fibrosis was reduced by injection of anti-CD4 mAb on day 12, when G-EAT was very severe (4-5+). Together, these results suggest a critical role for TGFbeta1 in fibrosis initiated by autoimmune-induced inflammation. Autoreactive CD4(+) T cells may contribute to thyroid fibrosis through production of TGFbeta1. This G-EAT model provides a new model to study how fibrosis associated with autoimmune damage can be inhibited.", 
    "687": "As many as 15 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus received monopril in a dose of 5 mg daily. Studied in the patients was the drug effect on the functional renal reserve and glomerular filtration rate. Determination of the functional renal reserve has been shown to be a criterion for an early diagnosis of the preclinical stage of diabetic nephropathy. Administration of monopril in exhausted functional renal reserve permits preventing development of proteinuria or allows a lapse of time for it to develop.", 
    "688": "In treating patients with hypertensive heart, effects of drugs on processes of lipoperoxidation should be taken into account since in heart remodelling there occurs an imbalance between peroxide oxidation on lipids and bodily antioxidant system of defence. Most investigators believe that calcium antagonists, beta- and alpha-adrenoblockers, inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, nitrates, and some diuretics exert in some way or other a positive effect on the above imbalance. Further studies are warranted on a new class of hypotensive drugs--antagonists of angiotensin II receptors to free-radical oxidation of lipids.", 
    "689": "Cross-sensitivity between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema and cough, and angiotensin II receptor antagonist has been reported in the literature. Eczema-like skin reactions have never been documented. We report the first two cases.", 
    "690": "Two patients, aged 79 and 88 years, with a history of hypertension, were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which had been discontinued because of an eczematiform rash. In spite of substitution with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, the patients had developed the same eruption. The outcome was favourable after discontinuation of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The pharmacologic study suggested the possibility of a cross-sensitivity reaction between these two drugs.", 
    "691": "We report the first two cases of a cross-sensitivity between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonist presenting as an eczematiform rash. The exact mechanism is unknown, but clinicians must be aware that angiotensin II receptor antagonist is not a safe alternative in patients who have a history of eczematiform rash secondary to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as has been always reported with angioedema.", 
    "692": "Long-term studies carried out in type 1 insulin-dependent diabetic population have clearly demonstrated a tight glycaemic control to be a key factor in type 1 diabetes mellitus survival. A better HbA1c is associated with lesser retina and kidney complications. The DCCT study has clearly shown intensive insulin treatment (3 or more insulin injections per day) to be superior to conventional regimen (one or 2 insulin injections per day) to reduce the risk for development (primary prevention) of late diabetic complications. However, such intensive insulin regimen should be started early, maintained on the long-term, and should be based on a regular and adequate blood glucose self-monitoring. The beneficial effects of a tight glycaemic control to reduce the risk for progression (secondary prevention) of late diabetic complications has not been proved yet. Consequently, at this stage, non-glycaemic interventions (antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, laser photocoagulation surgery) are the most useful treatment modalities. The global prognosis of type 1 insulin-dependent diabetics is strongly linked to the patient attitude, to his understanding of the disease and to his motivation to participate in the disease management. This requests permanent, long-term, intensive patient's information and education. Information tools (from oral information to website) and strategies (from usual educational courses by the diabetes care team to general public information) remain to be fully evaluated.", 
    "693": "Because across-the-board data indicate that renin and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the kidney cortex are regulated in parallel and because ANG II can inhibit COX-2 expression, the purpose of our study was to characterize a potential general inhibitory feedback of the renin-angiotensin system on renocortical COX-2 expression in vivo. Rats were fed a high-, normal-, or low-salt diet or were chronically infused with furosemide (60 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)) or the left renal artery was clipped, and the animals were treated in addition to or without the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (10 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)). A high-salt diet reduced expression of COX-2, whereas a low-salt diet, furosemide infusion, and renal artery stenosis stimulated COX-2 expression. Additional angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition led to further increases in renocortical COX-2 expression by 62, 136, 300, 50, and 70% for a high-, normal-, and low-salt diet, furosemide infusion, and renal artery stenosis, respectively. Thus our data suggest a general inhibitory effect of the renin-angiotensin system on renocortical COX-2 expression.", 
    "694": "During the last decade, angiotensin-receptor blockers have established themselves as effective antihypertensive agents with impressive safety profile and placebo-like tolerability. Additionally, these compounds provide benefits beyond the reduction in blood pressure, in conditions such as heart failure and in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal insufficiency. It is tempting to group all angiotensin-receptor blockers together as a class, but a closer look reveals differences, for example, in chemical structure, metabolism, dissociation rates, and receptor affinities. Recent findings on the respective roles of the angiotensin receptors AT(1) and AT(2) have raised the possibility that the degree of selectivity for AT(1) over AT(2) might affect the performance of the drug. This review attempts to put the concept of selectivity in context and to assess the potential benefits in different organs, with focus on the kidney, endothelium and the heart.", 
    "695": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin type I (AT(1)) receptor blocking drugs block the effects of angiotensin II by different mechanisms. This study examined the effect of combination of different doses of the two drugs on blood pressure (BP).",

    "697": "The effect of the combination of low doses of the two drugs was more than additive (synergistic) with 80% of the full response achieved with L-2.5 + C-2.5. In higher doses the response was less than additive, but a greater decrease (P <.01) in systolic BP (44.6 +/- 2.5 mm Hg) was achieved with the combination than with captopril (37.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg), which was greater (P <.05) than with losartan (32.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg).",

There is a \"point of no return\" (serum creatinine of 3 mg/dL), after which the deterioration of renal function becomes inevitable. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman, with advanced IgAN (serum creatinine > 3 mg/dL), who experienced remission of proteinuria and long-lasting stabilisation of renal function, after treatment with a 6-month steroid course. Literature information on the therapy for advanced phases of IgAN is inadequate. Our multicenter randomised controlled trial, aimed at evaluating the effects of a 6-month steroid course, included 18 patients with mild CRF at baseline. The ten patients that we treated experienced better renal survival than the eight patients who received no steroids, with an expected renal survival of 29.5 and 6.5 years, respectively. In a prospective study of patients with serum creatinine of 1.6 - 2.9 mg/dl, Ballardie and Roberts compared 19 patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs and 19 control patients: renal survival at 5 years was 72% in treated and 5% in control patients. Goumenos et al. retrospectively evaluated 39 patients treated with steroids and azathioprine and 22 untreated patients: a non-progressive course was observed in 79.5% of treated patients and in 36% of untreated patients. Tsuruya et al. retrospectively examined 26 patients treated with steroids and cyclophosphamide and 19 untreated patients: the expected renal survival was of 5.2 years in treated and 4.8 years in untreated patients, respectively. Prospective controlled trials are essential for evaluating the real effectiveness of immunosuppressive therapy in IgAN patients with impaired renal function. We have recently proposed a study to compare steroids alone and steroids plus azathioprine, because it is mandatory to look for safe and effective therapies that delay as much as possible the start of dialysis, also in patients with already established CRF.",

    "727": "Acute decompensated heart failure is characterized by hemodynamic abnormalities as well as neuroendocrine activation, which contribute to heart failure symptoms, progressive cardiac dysfunction, and sudden death. The therapeutic goals in patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure are to reverse acute hemodynamic abnormalities, relieve symptoms, and initiate treatment that will slow disease progression and improve long-term survival. Traditional hemodynamic targets in acute heart failure have been reduction in left and right ventricular filling pressures, reduction in systemic vascular resistance, and increase in cardiac output. Treatments aimed at these targets in patients with acute decompensated heart failure include diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents. In patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure, persistently elevated left ventricular filling pressure has been shown to be highly predictive of an increased risk of fatal decompensation and sudden death. Measures of systemic perfusion, arterial pressure, and vascular resistance have not. Thus, there is a more compelling physiologic rationale for the use of vasodilators than for inotropic agents in these patients. An ideal agent for acute decompensated heart failure would be one that rapidly reduces pulmonary wedge pressure, results in balanced arterial and venous dilation, promotes natriuresis, lacks direct positive inotropic effects, and does not result in reflex neuroendocrine activation.",

Additionally, these trials have provided important information regarding the indications, dosing, and extent of therapeutic benefits of the different beta-blockers studied in patients with heart failure. The recognition that beta-blockers relieve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival in patients with heart failure represents one of the most important therapeutic advances in the treatment of this complex disorder. Beta-blockers, along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists, now represent the standard of care for patients with heart failure.", 
    "729": "After acute ischemia of tissues, neovascularization must be sufficient and fast enough to preserve tissue integrity and organ function, and may thus be considered as a therapeutic strategy. This study examined the possible role of the very-low-dose combination of perindopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and indapamide (diuretic), used first-line in the treatment of essential hypertension, on ischemia-induced angiogenesis. Ischemia was produced by artery femoral occlusion in rats treated or not with the very-low-dose combination (perindopril 0.76 mg/kg/day + indapamide 0.24 mg/kg/day) or each component given alone at the same dosage for 3 and 28 days. At day 3, angiographic vessel density and laser Doppler perfusion data showed significant improvement in ischemic/nonischemic leg ratio by, respectively, 1.9-fold and 1.5-fold in rats treated with the very-low-dose combination when compared with controls (p < 0.05). This was associated with an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 2.2-fold) and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (1.6-fold) protein content in the ischemic hindlimb, assessed by Western blot. At day 28, the very-low-dose combination (3- and 1.6-fold) and perindopril alone (1.8- and 1.4-fold) and indapamide alone (2.0- and 1.4-fold) increased the angiograhic score and blood flow perfusion, respectively, in reference to controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, addition of VEGF-neutralizing antibody (2.5 microg/kg twice a week) or NOS inhibitor (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, 10 mg/kg/day) prevented the pro-angiogenic effect induced by the perindopril/indapamide combination. The very-low-dose combination of perindopril and indapamide induces an early and sustained effect on the revascularization process observed in ischemic tissue and may provide a favorable therapeutic neovascularization after ischemia.", 
    "730": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are an important class of drugs in cardiovascular disease. As their name suggests, they act by blocking angiotensin converting enzyme, thereby limiting the production of angiotensin II, the most active component of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system. This system plays an important role in maintenance of blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid balance. Therefore, by blocking this system, the ACEIs have wide ranging effects. Recent trials have reaffirmed their place in the management of hypertension, congestive cardiac failure, in the prevention of renal complications in diabetes and the prevention of strokes in 'at risk' patients. There are still many ongoing trials using the ACEIs. These trials are mainly aimed at comparing their efficacy with 'older' drugs (such as betablockers) and 'newer' drugs such as the angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium antagonists in different indications, such as heart failure and diabetic nephropathy. The impact of these drugs on the prevention of macro- and micro vascular complications in diabetes is also being investigated. The results of all these trials, when available, are expected to reaffirm the important role of this class of drugs in our modern day medical armamentarium. In this review, the ongoing clinical trials involving ACEIs, the rationale behind these trials and what impact they hope to have on our current understanding of the role of this important class of drug in medical practice, will be discussed.", 
    "731": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is increasing in prevalence worldwide, particularly in the elderly. Accordingly, this epidemic is likely to translate into a major increase in healthcare costs. Systolic heart failure is the most common cause of CHF presentations. Although the causes vary, the most common single aetiological factor is ischaemic heart disease, which accounts for approximately 50% of heart failure presentations. Research into CHF pharmacotherapy has been copious, with the focus principally centred on systolic heart failure. The evidence base for pharmacotherapy in CHF is amongst the largest currently in clinical medicine. There have been multiple trials establishing the mortality and morbidity benefits of pharmacotherapy. Amongst these, large scale trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone have provided a sound basis for evidence-based treatment approaches to the CHF patient. Recently research interest has increased in biomedical engineering with studies being performed in biventricular pacing and mechanical hearts. Early data with biventricular pacing or cardiac resynchronisation therapy is encouraging. Diastolic heart failure alone accounts for at least 20 - 40% of CHF presentations and whilst it may occur in isolation, is most commonly seen in association with systolic heart failure. In this study, we present a broad overview of the current therapeutic modalities for the management of CHF, with particular emphasis on pharmacotherapy.", 
    "732": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT-1 receptor antagonists reduce the effects of angiotensin II, however they may have different clinical effects. This is because the ACE inhibitors, but not the AT-1 receptor antagonists, increase the levels of substance P, bradykinin and tissue plasminogen activator. The AT-1 receptor antagonists, but not the ACE inhibitors, are capable of inhibiting the effects of angiotensin II produced by enzymes other than ACE. On the basis of the present clinical trial evidence, AT-1 receptor antagonists, rather than the ACE inhibitors, should be used to treat hypertension associated with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Both groups of drugs are useful when hypertension is not complicated by LV hypertrophy, and in diabetes. In the treatment of diabetes with or without hypertension, there is good clinical support for the use of either an ACE inhibitor or an AT-1 receptor antagonist. ACE inhibitors are recommended in the treatment of renal disease that is not associated with diabetes, after myocardial infarction when left ventricular dysfunction is present, and in heart failure. As the incidence of cough is much lower with the AT-1 receptor antagonists, these can be substituted for ACE inhibitors in patients with hypertension or heart failure who have persistent cough. Preliminary studies suggest that combining an AT-1 receptor antagonist with an ACE inhibitor may be more effective than an ACE inhibitor alone in the treatment of hypertension, diabetes with hypertension, renal disease without diabetes and heart failure. However, further trials are required before combination therapy can be recommended in these conditions.", 
    "733": "Diabetes mellitus increases the risk for hypertension and associated cardiovascular diseases, including coronary, cerebrovascular, renal and peripheral vascular disease. The risk for developing cardiovascular disease is increased when both diabetes and hypertension co-exist; in fact, over 11 million Americans have both diabetes and hypertension. These numbers will continue to climb, internationally, since the leading associated risk for diabetes development, obesity, has reached epidemic proportions, globally. Moreover, the frequent association of diabetes with dyslipidemia, as well as coagulation, endothelial, and metabolic abnormalities also aggravates the underlying vascular disease process in patients who possess these comorbid conditions. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are overactivated in both hypertension and diabetes. Drugs that inhibit this system, such as ACE inhibitors and more recently angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs), have proven beneficial effects on the micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes, especially the kidney. The BRILLIANT study showed that lisinopril reduces microalbuminuria better than CCB therapy. Numerous other long-term studies confirm this association with ACE inhibitors including the HOPE trial. Furthermore, the European Controlled trial of Lisinopril in Insulin-dependent Diabetes (EUCLID) study, showed that lisinopril slowed the progression of renal disease, even in individuals with mild albuminuria. In fact, there are now five appropriately powered randomized placebo-controlled trials to show that both ACE inhibitors and ARBs slow progression of diabetic nephropathy in people with type 2 diabetes. These effects were shown to be better than conventional blood pressure lowering therapy, including dihydropyridine CCBs. In patients with microalbuminuria, ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce the progression of microalbuminuria to proteinuria and provide a risk reduction of between 38 and 60% for progression to proteinuria. This is important since microalbuminuria is known to be associated with increased vascular permeability and decreased responsiveness to vasodilatory stimuli. Recently, increased AVP levels have been lined to microalbuminuria and hyperfiltration in diabetes. The microvascular and macrovascular benefits of ACE inhibition, ARBs and possible role of AVP antagonists in diabetic patients will be discussed, as will be recommendations for its clinical use.", 
    "734": "In the course of cardiac diseases, various neuruhomonal systems in the plasma are activated. So far there have been only isolated results of investigations about the functional state of central neuropeptide systems in cardiac diseases and, in particular, in heart failure. We investigated, therefore, the central vasopressinergic system, an important neuropeptide system in cardiocirculatory regulation in a model of myocardial hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction, a model of supravalvular aortic stenosis. In addition to increased vasopressin concentrations in plasma, central vasopressin is also altered in this model. A differential stimulation of vasopressin in the hypothalamic areas and in the areas of the brain stem that are involved in central cardiocirculatory regulation was detected. Reduced vasopressin concentrations in the locus coeruleus, an important regulatory area of sympathetic nervous activity, suggest a central regulatory mechanism through which stimulation of the sympathetic nervous activity can be prevented. Our investigations showed that non-osmotic factors like the baroreceptor reflex and angiotensin II, are important stimuli of the vasopressinergic system. We were also able to show that the central vasopressinergic system in rats with experimental heart failure and myocardial hypertrophy is inhibited by treatment with an ACE inhibitor and AT1 receptor antagonist. As seen with autoradiography, this effect is mediated by a central effect of the drugs. Research into central regulatory mechanisms in cardiovascular diseases is, on the one hand, of crucial importance to our understanding of complex pathophysiological processes, and on the other hand, it serves the development of new therapeutic approaches with the goal of influencing these mechanisms directly pharmacologically and for the elucidation of central, currently unknown effects of cardiovascular drugs.",

After the stroke there remains a maximum vascular risk of recurrence (stroke, heart attack or vascular death). The known vascular risk factors (RF) could only explain 50% of vascular events. A better knowledge of atherogenesis, of the mechanisms that cause instability in the atheroma plaque and of new vascular RF gives rise to new preventive therapeutic approaches. This knowledge is the result of new clinical trials, such as the use of ACE inhibitors, statins, vitamins related with homocysteine, and the use of antihypertensive drugs to prevent cognitive deterioration or dementia, which add to those that have already been conducted.",

In both placebo and perindopril treated patients, a close inverse correlation was noted between the magnitude of nephrin gene expression and the degree of proteinuria (placebo: r=0.86, p=0.013, perindopril: r=0.91, p=0.004).", 
    "739": "Modulation in nephrin expression is related to the extent of proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy.

    "740": "Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or beta isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) are nephroprotective in diabetes mellitus. We investigated the influence of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus and of treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (4 mg/kg p.o. twice daily for 4 weeks) on the expression of PKC beta 1 and PKC beta 2 in the renal cortex of female Sprague-Dawley rats. Immunohistochemistry indicated an enhanced renocortical accumulation of macrophages expressing both MHC II, a marker for antigen-presenting cells, as well as PKC beta 2 in STZ diabetes which was confirmed by Western blotting demonstrating an enhanced renocortical expression of MHC II (1.8-fold) as well as of membrane-associated PKC beta 2 (1.9-fold). Whereas immunohistochemistry could not detect unequivocal alterations, Western blotting showed a rise in the renocortical expression of membrane-associated PKC beta 1 (1.7-fold) in STZ diabetes. Lisinopril lowered renocortical albumin content and proteinuria in STZ diabetes and attenuated the enhanced accumulation of macrophages expressing PKC beta 2 as well as the increase of membrane-associated expression of PKC beta 1 and PKC beta 2 in the renal cortex. The data suggest that the nephroprotective actions of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in experimental diabetes mellitus were associated with and thus could be mediated in part by inhibition of diabetes-induced activation of PKC beta isoenzymes in the renal cortex.", 
    "741": "Essential hypertension presents a component of insulin resistance syndrome. Insulin resistance exists whenever normal concentration of hormone produces less than normal biologic response.

For assessment of peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness we used a reduced samples Bergman's Minimal Model method.

Advances in pharmacological and mechanical reperfusion therapy have improved the survival of patients who experience myocardial infarction. Although revascularisation techniques have been shown to reduce infarct size and in-hospital mortality, patients recovering from myocardial infarction are still at increased risk for reinfarction, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Despite impressive technological advances, lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions remain the key components of secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Although the concept of secondary prevention of reinfarction and death has been investigated vigorously for several decades, preventive therapy has been seriously underused by physicians. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of secondary prevention postmyocardial infarction clinical trials, in the hope of improving the utilization of effective therapies in patients with coronary heart disease.",

It has been shown that chymase activity is present in monkey, dog, and hamster eyes. Because chymase activates various cytokines by increasing Ang II formation, thereby promoting the production of extracellular matrix, the role of Ang II in wound healing has attracted much interest. In this work, we created sclerocorneal wounds in hamster eyes and measured the levels of ACE and chymase activities in the eye during the wound healing process.",

This ECE-activity could be inhibited by Captopril and Phosporamidon, suggesting a potency for prevention and therapy of cerebral vasospasm. However, the structural analogue of big ET-1, [(22)D-Val] big ET-1 (16-38), was ineffective in reducing big ET-1 induced vasoconstriction and rather increased contraction in E+ vessels. Therefore further studies of the biochemical nature of the functional relevant cerebrovascular ECE activity are required for better understanding and development of other efficient ECE inhibitors.", 
    "751": "COX-2-derived prostaglandins (PG) have been suggested to be important modulators of renin release and expression. However, the role of COX-2 in various high-renin states is still being debated. In the present studies we explored the role of COX-2-derived PG on basal and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-stimulated plasma and renal renin concentrations (PRC and RRC, RIA), and mRNA expression (RmRNA, RNAse protection assay) in experimental diabetes (DM). Groups of moderately hyperglycemic (n = 5, approximately 350 mg/dl), streptozotocin-diabetic rats (D) after 3 weeks of DM were treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, MF-tricyclic (MF, 5 mg/kg/day for 10 days in food), the combination of MF and the ACEI enalapril (3 mg/kg/day), enalapril alone, or vehicle (MF-free chow), for 10 days. Non-diabetic control rats, fed MF-free chow, were also studied. All groups of diabetic rats demonstrated similar glycemic control. Treatment with ACEI resulted in significant elevations in PRC, RRC and RmRNA as compared to non-ACEI treated groups of diabetic and control rats. A similar rise in these parameters was observed in the rats treated with the combination of ACEI and MF. Furthermore, in diabetic rats treated with MF alone, PRC and RRC were similar to vehicle-treated animals. Diabetic rats demonstrated higher urinary PG as compared to controls. MF-treated rats demonstrated a significant reduction in urinary PG excretion. In summary, selective COX-2 inhibition influenced neither basal renin status nor ACEI-induced renin release and expression in diabetic rats. These findings do not support a significant role for COX-2 in mediating renin status in diabetes.", 
    "752": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an enzyme that plays a major role in vasoactive peptide metabolism, and it has been implicated in various cardiovascular diseases. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C activator, has been shown to increase ACE mRNA at the transcriptional level in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We have investigated the transcriptional mechanism involved in protein kinase C induction of the ACE gene. Deletion and transfection analyses have revealed that two regions are required for PMA-inducible gene expression. The first is a G+C-rich region located in the proximal ACE promoter bearing overlapping consensus recognition sequences for stimulatory protein-1 (Sp1) and early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift experiments have shown that Egr-1 is present in the specific nucleoprotein complex induced by PMA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The second region is located in the distal ACE promoter. DNase I footprinting analysis restricted this region to a 21-bp element containing a cAMP-responsive element/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-responsive element sequence. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift analyses have revealed that activating protein 1 (AP-1) is the transcription factor binding the cAMP-responsive element/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-responsive element located in the ACE promoter after PMA stimulation. Mutations of either Egr-1 or AP-1 binding sites partially abrogate ACE expression induced by PMA, whereas mutation of both sites totally abrogates PMA-induced ACE expression. Treatment of cells with PD98059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1-specific inhibitor, inhibited PMA-induced ACE expression. Our results demonstrate that the two transcription factors, Egr-1 and AP-1, are involved in the PMA-induced ACE transcriptional activation in human endothelial cells via the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathway.",

Patients with chronic kidney disease have significant CVD, and carry a high cardiovascular burden by the time they commence renal replacement therapy (RRT). The severity of CVD that has been observed in dialysis patients lead to a growing body of research examining the pathogenesis and progression of CVD during the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (ie, predialysis phase). Multiple factors are involved in the development of CVD in CKD. More importantly, critical and key factors seem to develop early in the course of CKD, and result in preventable worsening of CVD in this patient population. Anemia is common in patients with CKD, and has been shown to have an independent role in the genesis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and subsequent CVD. Unfortunately, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with CKD. Early intervention, and better correction of anemia, seems to gain a great momentum in the prevention and management of CVD in CKD. Hypertension is another risk factor that has been targeted by the National Kidney Foundation Task Force on CVD in chronic kidney disease. This article reviews the different factors involved in the pathogenesis of CVD in CKD and the evidence supporting early and aggressive intervention.",

The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting activity of the hydrolyzed protein was assessed with hippuryl-His-Leu as the substrate. The amount of hippuric acid released, due to uninhibited ACE activity, was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. ACE inhibiting (ACEI) activity was found to increase with increasing DH; the 43% DH hydrolysate exhibited the highest activity and had an IC(50) of 1.08 mg/mL. Peptide fractions with high ACEI activity were isolated using size exclusion chromatography. The fraction that possessed the highest ACEI activity contained peptides with GYP, HL(I), HPY, HPGH, L(I)F, SPY, and YPH sequence motifs, as determined by reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a novel immonium precursor-ion scanning technique.

METHODS: This randomized, single-blind study consisted of 90 patients with essential hypertension, who were divided into losartan, lisinopril and nisodipine groups with corresponding medications as indicated. The genotypes of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion, angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T polymorphism and expressions of ACE and AT1 receptor genes were examined individually. RESULTS: The basal level of mRNA expression of AT1 receptor was lower in patients with MM genotype of AGT gene than those in patients with MT 1 and TT genotypes, but between the latter two, no significant differences were found. The three antihypertensive drugs, when significantly lowering the blood pressure, reduced AT1 receptor mRNA expression concurrently. Losartan and lisinopril both decreased ACE mRNA expression levels that were positively correlated with the difference of the diastolic blood pressure whereas nisodipine elevated ACE mRNA expression, showing inverse correlation to the difference of thediastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION: For patients with hypertension who have elevated basal levels of AT1 mRNA expression and AGT T allele or who retain high basal expression levels of ACE mRNA AT1 antagonists and ACE inhibitors that execute their action through RAS are preferentially selected, and in cases of low basal levels of ACE mRNA calcium antagonists are preferred.", 
    "775": "Recent studies have shown the existence of two important inhibitory mechanisms for the control of NACL and water intake: one mechanism involves serotonin in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) and the other depends on alpha(2)-adrenergic/imidazoline receptors probably in the forebrain areas. In the present study we investigated if alpha(2)-adrenergic/imidazoline and serotonergic inhibitory mechanisms interact to control NaCl and water intake. Male Holtzman rats with cannulas implanted simultaneously into the lateral ventricle (LV) and bilaterally into the LPBN were used. The ingestion of 0.3 M NaCl and water was induced by treatment with the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg of body weight)+the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg) injected subcutaneously 1 h before the access of rats to water and 0.3 M NaCl. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the alpha(2)-adrenergic/imidazoline agonist clonidine (20 nmol/1 microl) almost abolished water (1.6+/-1.2, vs. vehicle: 7.5+/-2.2 ml/2 h) and 0.3 M NaCl intake (0.5+/-0.3, vs. vehicle: 2.2+/-0.8 ml/2 h). Similar effects were produced by bilateral injections of the 5HT(2a/2c) serotonergic agonist 2,5-dimetoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI, 5 microg/0.2 microl each site) into the LPBN on water (3.6+/-0.9 ml/2 h) and 0.3 M NaCl intake (0.4+/-0.2 ml/2 h). Injection of the alpha(2)-adrenergic/imidazoline antagonist idazoxan (320 nmol) i.c.v. completely blocked the effects of clonidine on water (8.4+/-1.5 ml/2 h) and NaCl intake (4.0+/-1.2 ml/2 h), but did not change the effects of LPBN injections of DOI on water (4.2+/-1.0 ml/2 h) and NaCl intake (0.7+/-0.2 ml/2 h). Bilateral injections of methysergide (4 microg/0.2 microl each site) into the LPBN increased 0.3 M NaCl intake (6.4+/-1.9 ml/2 h), not water intake. The inhibitory effect of i.c.v. clonidine on water and 0.3 M NaCl was still present after injections of methysergide into the LPBN (1.5+/-0.8 and 1.7+/-1.4 ml/2 h, respectively). The results show that the inhibitory effects of the activation of alpha(2)-adrenergic/imidazoline receptors in the forebrain are still present after blockade of the LPBN serotonergic mechanisms and vice versa for the activation of serotonergic mechanisms of the LPBN. Therefore, each system may act independently to inhibit NaCl and water intake.",

The authors discuss also possible interactions of acetylsalicyl acid and ACE inhibitors which in retrospective analyses indicate possible veakening of the ACE-I when administered concurrently with ASA in cardiac failure. The authors mention also other antiaggregation drugs, which similarly as ASA, significantly reduce the mortality in acute coronary syndrome. Their long-term administration is however not associated with further improvement of the diagnosis. Trials are mentioned which compare antiaggregation and anticolagulation treatment in patients with ischaemic heart disease. They analyze also the effect of dosage (benefit vs. risk). After ASA > 300 mg there are more frequent complications, and without a proved effect on total mortality, while doses < or = 100 mg seem to be safer but there is evidence that they are effective in reducing the total mortality of patients with IHD and/or cardiac failure.", 
    "781": "Reduction of excessive neurohumoral activation in chronic heart failure (CHF) improves the prognoses. In addition to reduction of angiotensin production or angiotensin II action and the influence of the sympathoadrenal system also blocking of aldosterone effects becomes part of the therapeutic procedure in patients with CHF. Excessive systemic and probably also local aldosterone production promotes undesirable fluid retention, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia, induction of hypertrophy and fibrosis of the heart muscle and blood vessels and the development of endothelial dysfunction, peripheral vasoconstriction and depression of the baroreflex. In addition to classical effects also the existence of a rapid, so-called non-genomic effect of aldosterone is assumed. Adding a blocker of aldosterone receptors to ACE inhibition was not recommended due to possibility development of hyperkalaemia. Later it was revealed that ACE inhibitors are unable to block sufficiently the action of aldosterone and that addition of spironolactone in small amounts to ACE inhibition and diuretics does not cause in patients with CHF a major increase of the potassium level. In the RALES study (Randomized Aldacton Evaluation Study) comprising 1663 patients with serious heart failure (NYHA III, IV) addition of 25 mg spironolactone to standard treatment with ACE inhibitor, diuretic and as rule also digoxin reduced the mortality by another 30% as compared with the addition of placebo. Undesirable effects were minimal. As to potential protective mechanisms of spironolactone the greatest importance is ascribed to the reduction of excessive fibrosis of the heart muscle. Spironolactone reduces the level of the circulating N-terminal aminopeptide procollagen type III the high level of which is associated with deterioration of the prognosis.",

Furthermore the authors investigated the effect of ACE inhibitor treatment (ACEI), quinapril, on the level of these markers of endothelial dysfunction. The level of adhesion molecules [intercellular cytoadhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, P-selectin], von Willebrand s factor (vWf) and endothelin-1 were assessed in patients with mild essential hypertension without further cardiovascular risk factors or clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis before and after quinapril treatment (n = 25) and compared with normotensive controls (n = 29). The results of the examinations provided evidence that contrary to controls the hypertensive subjects had significantly higher ICAM-1 levels (237.8 vs. 207.8 ng/ml, P = 0.02) vWf (118 vs. 106 IU/dl, p < 0.05) and endothelin-1 (5.81 vs. 5.15 fmol/ml, p < 0.05). Three-month treatment of hypertensive patients with ACEI led to a significant drop of endothelin-1 levels (5.81 vs. 5.26 fmol/ml, p = 0.01). The authors proved also an unequivocal declining trend of other cytoadhesion molecules and vWf after ACEI treatment, the changes however were not statistically significant. From the investigation it may be concluded that also patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension without other cardiovascular risk factors or clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis have significantly elevated plasma levels of ICAM-1, vWf and endothelin-1. Higher concentrations of these factors suggest endothelial dysfunction already in mild forms of essential hypertension without further risk factors or cardiovascular complications. A significant drop of endothelin-1 and declining trend of the other investigated indicators suggest that ACEI treatment can favourably influence endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients also independently on reduction of the BP.",

Aim of the study was treatment of hypertension in patients with DM of both types by the ACE inhibitor trandolapril in dose of 2-4 mg, possibly in combination with the calcium channel blocker verapamil--240 mg. The investigation was completed by 79 patients (60 patients with DM type 2 and 19 with DM type 1). All patients achieved the target blood pressure which in 1997 was also for patients with DM less than 140/90 mm Hg. As good as 20% of the patients achieved these values when treated with 2 mg trandolapril, 52% on a dose of 4 mg and 23% after combined treatment. Only 25% of the patients achieved values lower than 130/85 mm Hg, as recommended in the contemporary recommendations \"Prevention of ischaemic heart disease in adult age\" published in 1998. On comparison of other risk factors in groups of patients with a BP below 130/85 mm Hg and higher than this borderlimit line it was revealed that one-year treatment of hypertension with trandolapril--4 mg alone or combined with verapamil 240 mg led to a greater reduction of the pulse rate, fasting insulin level, hematicrit and triglycerides and to an increase of HDL-cholesterol. This study revealed that systematic treatment of hypertension by the above mentioned drugs in patients with DM is effective and well tolerated. In addition to reduction of the blood pressure the activity of the sympathetic nervous system was reduced and some metabolic parameters improved.", 
    "784": "Mesangial cells (MC) serve a number of functions in the renal glomerular capillary including structural support of the capillary tuft, modulation of glomerular hemodynamics, and a phagocytic function allowing removal of macromolecules and immune complexes. The proliferation of MC is a prominent feature of glomerular disease including IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, and diabetic nephropathy. In experimental animal models of nephritis, MC proliferation frequently precedes and is linked to the increase of extracellular matrix in the mesangium and glomerulosclerosis. Reduction of MC proliferation in glomerular disease models by treatment with heparin, low-protein diet, or antibodies to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), have been shown to reduce extracellular matrix expansion and glomerulosclerotic changes. Therefore, MC proliferation inhibitors may offer therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of proliferative glomerular disease. It is also known that the MC proliferation is inhibited by many kinds of pharmacological drugs, for example, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, leukotriene D(4) (LTD(4)) antagonists, PDGF inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) inhibitors, 3-hydroxy-3 methyl glutaryl-coenzymeA (HMG-CoA) inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) inhibitors, and others.

Here, we demonstrate that mice infected with trypomastigotes develop potent edema after treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (or kininase II) inhibitor captopril. Experiments performed with specific kinin receptor (B2R/B1R) antagonists and knockout mice revealed that the early-phase (3-h) edema is mediated by the constitutive B2R, whereas the late-phase (24-h) response depends on stimulation of the up-regulated B1R. Given previous evidence that parasite invasion of cells expressing B2R is potentiated by captopril, we investigated the prerequisites for in vitro infection of Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing either B1R or B2R, human umbilical vein endothelial cells activated by lipopolysaccharide, and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Our results indicate that captopril potentiates parasite invasion regardless of the kinin (B2/B1) activation pathways, whereas DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid (MGTA), an inhibitor of kininase I (carboxypeptidase M/N), selectively decreases parasite infectivity for B1R-expressing cells. These data suggest that formation of the B1R agonist, i.e., [des-Arg] kinins, critically depends on the processing action of kininase I, here proposed as a potential pathogenesis cofactor. Collectively, our data suggest that fluctuations in the levels of kininases may modulate parasite infectivity and pathological outcome in Chagas' disease.",

The active metabolite of benazepril, benazeprilat, is eliminated principally ( approximately 85%) via biliary excretion in cats. A total of 20 control animals and 32 cats with moderate renal insufficiency induced by partial nephrectomy were used. Assessments were made at steady state after treatment with placebo or benazepril (0.25-2 mg/kg) once daily for a minimum of 10 days. The PK endpoint was the AUC (0-->24 h) of total plasma benazeprilat. The PD endpoints were systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures (respectively SBP, DBP and MBP) measured by telemetry, and plasma ACE activity, assessed by an ex vivo assay. Renal function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), measured by inulin clearance, and plasma creatinine concentrations (1/PCr). As compared with control animals, the renal insufficient cats had a 78% reduction in GFR (0.57 +/- 0.41 mL/min kg), increased plasma creatinine (2.7 +/- 1.0 mg/dL), urea (44.0 +/- 11.9 mg/dL) and ACE activity, and moderately increased blood pressure (SBP 171.8 +/- 5.1 mmHg) (all parameters P < 0.05). Renal insufficient cats receiving benazepril had significantly (P < 0.05) lower SBP, DBP, MBP and ACE, and higher GFR values as compared with placebo-treated animals. There were no significant differences in SBP, DBP, MBP, benazeprilat or ACE values according to the degree of renal insufficiency in cats receiving benazepril. It is concluded that no dose adjustment of benazepril is necessary in cats with moderate renal insufficiency.",

HOPE worldwide Jamaica is a 7-year-old private voluntary organization that collaborates with the government of Jamaica to provide a mobile medical service to poor rural communities. The records between January 1999 and December 1999 of 1091 chronic disease patients aged > 30 years were reviewed. The average recorded age of the patients was 64 years and 82% among them were females. 60% had hypertension, 16% had diabetes and 24% had both diabetes and hypertension. There were 2390 visits for hypertension, with an average of 2 visits per patient. 34% of patients had a blood pressure of < or = 140/90 mmHg while 43% had a blood pressure < 160/95 mmHg. Compliance was defined as daily consistency in taking prescribed medication. 44% of the patients with hypertension were non-compliant at the time of their visit. Antihypertensive treatment included thiazide diuretics (65%), reserpine (50%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (30%) and alpha-methyldopa (5%). There were 1122 visits for diabetes, with an average of 2 visits per patient. Among the diabetic patients 23% were controlled to a fasting blood glucose (FBG) level of less than 6.7 mmol/l and 38% to below 8 mmol/l. 30% of the diabetic patients were non-compliant at the time of their visit.

The BP-lowering efficacy of eplerenone was similar in blacks and whites. In a separate study in patients whose BP was controlled inadequately by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, addition of eplerenone significantly reduced systolic BP, and to a lesser extent, diastolic BP. There were no significant changes in potassium levels in this study. Eplerenone increased active renin and aldosterone levels, indicating that it blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

Studies have shown that all of these deleterious effects can, at least in part, be reversed by aldosterone receptor blockade.

The widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists for heart and kidney disease might therefore expose arteriopathic diabetic patients to potential harm if they had critical renal artery stenosis. This review looks at the natural history of ARVD in the diabetic and non-diabetic populations: while it is common, it only rarely leads to renal failure. Hence intervention to revascularize ischaemic kidney son the basis of radiological appearances alone may subject some patients to unnecessary therapy. Although untested by randomized trial, a policy of watchful waiting may be the simplest strategy for most diabetic patients with suspected ARVD, reserving angiography and angioplasty (usually backed up by a stent) for those with an abrupt decline in renal function and no other cause for renal deterioration. Future clinical trials may better define subgroups of patients who will truly benefit from renal revascularization.",

We have analysed prescribing of antihypertensives by qualified family physicians (FPs) (n=77) and compared this with that of general practitioners (GPs) (n =41) by auditing 1791 prescriptions of FPs and 914 prescriptions of GPs, issued to patients with uncomplicated hypertension, at 15 out of 20 health centres in Bahrain. The choice of antihypertensive(s) by FPs and GPs was comparable and conformed with the WHO/ISH guidelines as regards preference for: (i) beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as monotherapy; (ii) two-drug combinations (diuretic-beta-blocker; beta-blocker-CCB); (iii) three-drug combinations (diuretic-beta-blocker-CCB; diuretic-beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor; beta-blocker- ACE inhibitor-CCBs), and (iv) choice of drug used for the elderly either alone (CCBs) or as combinations (diuretic-beta-blocker; beta-blocker-CCB and diuretic-beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor; diuretic-beta-blocker-CCB). In several instances prescribing by both FPs and GPs was not in accordance with the WHO/ISH guidelines: reluctance to prescribe diuretics as monotherapy; use of suboptimal combinations (beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor); and extensive use of beta-blockers and irrational use of immediate-release nifedipine in elderly. A statistically significant prescribing difference between FPs and GPs was evident in the following: beta-blockers as monotherapy (P =0.01), diuretic-CCB (P=0.046), and diuretic-CCB-methyldopa (P=0.01) combination, and immediate-release nifedipine monotherapy in the elderly (P=0.027), were prescribed more often by the GPs. However, beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor-CCB combination was more often prescribed by FPs (P=0.046). Remarkable differences in prescribing pattern of antihypertensives between the FPs and GPs were evident. Although the general pattern supported a superior prescribing profile of the FPs as expected, there is a need for improved prescribing by both GPs and FPs. Educational programmes, both graduate and residency training, and continuing professional education, should specifically address these deficiencies in order to assure quality primary health care.",

Lisinopril was restarted before her 18th SPA treatment, and immediately after return of treated plasma she developed facial redness and hypotension, which resolved after the return stopped and recurred when restarted. To study formation and degradation of kinins, exposed her plasma to glass beads. We found a normal kinin formation rate but an abnormal degradation and accumulation of Des-Arg9-BK. The kinin degradation enzymes ACE, aminopeptidase P (APP), and carboxypeptidase N (CPN) were measured while on an ACE inhibitor, showing absence of ACE activity, low APP, but normal CPN.",

Her ACE inhibitor shifted degradation toward Des-Arg9-BK formation, and her low APP was associated with a prolonged t50 and accumulation of the vasoactive Des-Arg9-BK.", 
    "826": "In well designed studies in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, combinations of the sustained-release (SR) formulation of the nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist verapamil 120 to 240 mg/day and the ACE inhibitor trandolapril 0.5 to 8 mg/day were significantly more effective in reducing sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline than placebo. In most randomised studies, combinations of verapamil SR 120 to 240 mg/day and trandolapril 0.5 to 8 mg/day were significantly more effective in lowering sitting DBP and SBP than the corresponding monotherapies administered at the same dosage. Trandolapril/verapamil SR 2/180 mg/day provided significantly more effective 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) control than of the corresponding monotherapies. Moreover, trandolapril/verapamil SR reduced BP in patients inadequately controlled with either of the corresponding monotherapies. The antihypertensive efficacy of trandolapril/verapamil SR 2/180 mg/day was generally similar to that of other combinations of antihypertensive agents (metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol/chlorthalidone, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide) in patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Trandolapril/verapamil SR reduced BP in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes or primary renal disease, Black patients and elderly patients. Trandolapril/verapamil SR was more effective than the individual components administered as monotherapy in reducing proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes or primary renal disease. Trandolapril/verapamil SR had a neutral or beneficial effect on metabolic parameters (glucose, insulin, lipids) in patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes. Trandolapril/verapamil SR preserved left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. Fewer cardiac events occurred after therapy with trandolapril/verapamil SR than after trandolapril alone in post-myocardial infarction patients with congestive heart failure. The incidence of adverse events in recipients of trandolapril/verapamil SR was similar to that of the individual components, and that of other combination therapies. In placebo-controlled trials conducted in the US, headache, upper respiratory tract infections, cough, constipation, atrioventricular block (first degree) and dizziness were the most commonly reported adverse events in recipients of combinations of verapamil SR (120 to 240 mg/day) and trandolapril (0.5 to 8 mg/day). In conclusion, the fixed-dose combination of trandolapril/verapamil SR is an effective treatment for patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes. Trandolapril/verapamil SR tended to be more effective than monotherapy with either verapamil SR or trandolapril, and generally showed antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of other combination antihypertensive therapies. Current data support the use of trandolapril/verapamil SR as an alternative treatment when monotherapy with either agent is not effective. Data from large clinical trials currently being conducted will assist in fully defining the role of trandolapril/verapamil SR as a cardio- and renoprotective agent.", 
    "827": "The antihypertensive efficacy of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril was evaluated in uninephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats. After 5 weeks of treatment, blood pressure, cardiac and aortic mass, as well as the functional status of the aortic endothelium, and the role played by the cyclooxygenase pathway were investigated. In addition, the effect of a sub-antihypertensive dose of the calcium antagonist verapamil, in combination with trandolapril, was also investigated. As compared to placebo, trandolapril returned blood pressure and aortic lamina media cross sectional area to normotensive values, significantly reduced the heart-to-body weight, and improved the acetylcholine-induced relaxation of aortic rings. This latter effect is thought to be mediated by the elimination of a substance derived from the cyclooxygenase pathway. Verapamil, in single therapy, did not reduce blood pressure, or heart-to-body weight, increased aortic lamina media cross sectional area and impaired acetylcholine-induced relaxation. When combined with trandolapril in dual therapy, some of the beneficial effects of trandolapril remained, whereas others were counterbalanced by verapamil. In conclusion, trandolapril proved to be an effective therapeutic drug in this animal model of hypertension. Combination of trandolapril with a sub-antihypertensive dose of verapamil did not show any positive synergistic effect; on the contrary, it outweighed some of the beneficial effects of trandolapril.",

Twenty-seven hypertensive patients were randomised to receive lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) for 5 weeks, and were subsequently crossed-over to the alternative treatment for a second 5-week period. Measurements of CBP, 24-h ABP and 5-days HBP were performed before randomisation and at the end of each treatment period. All measurement methods showed that lisinopril was more effective than losartan in reducing BP. However, the difference between the two drugs was demonstrated with greater precision using HBP (P<0.001) than 24-h ABP (P<0.01), whereas the poorest precision for demonstrating this difference was provided by CBP (P<0.05). Lisinopril was also found more effective than losartan in reducing HPP (P=0.01) and 24-h APP (P=0.03) whereas no such a difference was detected using measurements of CPP. It was concluded that the antihypertensive drugs may differ in their effects not only on BP, but also on PP. HBP monitoring appears to be as reliable as 24-h ABP monitoring in detecting differences in the effect of drugs on both BP and PP. Clinic measurements seem to be the least reliable method, particularly in the detection of differences in PP.",

Human NPP was injected at 20 L plasma equivalent per approximately 300 g of rat intravenously, and both PACAPs were injected at 10 g/kg intravenously. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate responses to all of these agonists were determined using a MacLab/8 system. Arterial plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection. Responses to NPP, the PACAPs and a specific PACAP antagonist were compared to assess the PACAPs as potential mediators of the cardiovascular effects of NPP.", 
    "832": "PACAP-38 mimicked the effects of NPP on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate more closely than did PACAP-27. Generally, NPP raised diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, and especially plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline, more impressively in degree and duration than that achieved by the PACAPs. The antagonism of PACAP receptors (PAC-1) significantly reduced the cardiovascular effects of NPP by 30% to 50%.", 
    "833": "PACAP-38, especially, may qualify as a potential mediator of the cardiovascular and sympathoadrenal effects of NPP but incomplete inhibition of NPP activity by PAC-1 receptor antagonism and the observed differences all suggest that PACAP is not the only peptide involved. Such peptidic mediation of the effects of NPP may explain the potentiation of NPP by captopril and why NPP remains effective after cholinergic blockade. These data suggest that PACAP is involved in a novel axis between NPP, cardiac function and blood pressure that resists angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.

Heart rate, cardiac output and stroke volume rose by 16%, 53% and 36%, respectively. Plasma catecholamines increased massively, notably adrenaline, raising the adrenaline to noradrenaline ratio from about 4:1 to 18:1. 2MDX attenuated the increments of SBP and heart rate by more than 90% and more than 70%, respectively, implicating the adrenal medulla. Beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol) potentiated the NPP-induced increase of SBP and DBP, but not that of heart rate. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine and propranolol) blocked the rise in SBP, DBP and heart rate.", 
    "837": "NPP's hypertensive action is attributable mainly to increases in systolic blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output (an increase in heart rate and stroke volume) with massive release of adrenal medullary catecholamines. Such effects suggest a novel axis between coagulation factor XII and the sympathoadrenal system, the cardiovascular effects of which are controlled by combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, but not by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.

    "841": "After adjusting for age and sex, discharge prescriptions resulted in the following ranges: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 34% to 46% of patients, acetylsalicylic acid 49% to 77%, beta-blockers 32% to 54%, calcium channel blockers 25% to 48%, lipid-lowering drugs 4% to 16% and nitrates 76% to 86%. Procedure use varied considerably across the province during the initial 10 days post-AMI (catheterization 3% to 28%; percutaneous coronary intervention 1% to 8%, and coronary artery bypass surgery 0 to 2%), as well as one year after discharge (27% to 47%, 8% to 17%, and 6% to 12%, respectively). Some variation was observed for cardiac complications after one year (unstable angina 9% to 21%; congestive heart failure and recurrent myocardial infarction, no major variation). However, there was no significant regional variation observed for one-year and three-year mortality rates (19% to 22% and 27% to 31%, respectively).", 
    "842": "There was marked regional variation in the rates of discharge prescriptions for cardiac medications and cardiac procedures in patients who have had an AMI in Quebec. These results suggest that the type of treatment received for an AMI depends on the region in which the patient lives. This variation appeared to affect readmission rates for unstable angina, but had no impact on mortality or other cardiac complications post-AMI.", 
    "843": "Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy increases susceptibility to reperfusion arrhythmias and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, may reduce that susceptibility via regression of LV hypertrophy. Rats (n=12 per group) were subjected to abdominal aortic constriction (AC) or sham-operation (SH) and from 3 to 6 weeks after surgery, 3 AC groups received ramipril (0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg per day p.o.) while the SH and 1 AC group received vehicle. Six weeks after surgery (ie after 3 weeks of treatment), the hearts were excised and subjected to independent Langendorf perfusion of left and right coronary beds. The left coronary bed was then subjected to ischemia (7 min) and reperfusion (5 min). Hypertrophied hearts from the vehicle AC group showed a significant increase in the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) compared with control hearts from the SH group (92%* vs 33%: *p<0.05); this difference was abolished by ramipril (42%, 50%, and 42%, at 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg per day, respectively). The LV weight/body weight ratio was significantly increased in all AC groups (regardless of ramipril treatment) relative to the SH group. At the cellular level, myocyte length was significantly increased in the vehicle AC group, but was normalized by ramipril treatment (1 mg/kg per day). At the molecular level, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) mRNA expression was also significantly increased in the vehicle AC group, but was again normalized by ramipril treatment (1 mg/kg per day). In conclusion, short-term treatment with ramipril reduced susceptibility to severe ventricular arrhythmias in hypertrophied rat hearts. This protection was achieved in the absence of a significant reduction in LV weight, but was accompanied by regression of myocyte hypertrophy, as reflected by reductions in cell size and ANF expression.", 
    "844": "The present study was aimed at investigating whether the regulation of vascular renin-angiotensin and endothelin (ET) systems is altered by a chronic blockade of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were supplemented with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100mgl(-1)) in drinking water for 4 weeks to inhibit the endogenous synthesis of NO. The mRNA expressions of renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1R), ET-1, type-A ET receptor (ET(A)), and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) were determined in the thoracic aorta by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The treatment with L-NAME significantly increased the blood pressure, while it decreased the tissue levels of nitrite/nitrate. The mRNA expression of renin, ACE, and AT1R was increased in the aorta. The protein expression of AT1R assessed by Western blot analysis was also increased. The expression of ET-1 and ET(A) mRNA was increased, whereas that of NEP mRNA decreased. The increased expression of renin-angiotensin and ET system genes and the decreased expression of NEP may in part be causally related with the development of hypertension induced by a chronic blockade of NO synthesis.", 
    "845": "Insulin resistance and/or compensatory hyperinsulinemia are associated with hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are considered to increase blood pressure through sympathetic nervous system activation, renin-angiotensin system stimulation, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Leptin, magnesium ions, nitric oxide, endothelin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha also modulate blood pressure. Decreasing insulin resistance by lifestyle modification including diet, weight loss, and physical exercise has been shown to reduce blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a beneficial effect on insulin resistance. On the other hand, the angiotensin II antagonist, losartan, does not affect insulin sensitivity. The selective alpha1-blockers have a favorable metabolic profile producing increases in insulin sensitivity. A short-acting type calcium channel blocker seems to decrease insulin sensitivity. On the other hand, long-acting type calcium channel blockers improve insulin sensitivity. Thiazide diuretics and most of the beta-blockers decrease insulin sensitivity. Vasodilatory beta-blockers have been reported to improve insulin sensitivity. Use of low-dose diuretics avoids the adverse effects seen with conventional doses."
