    "0": "We have not emphasized the traditional approaches to the treatment of congestive heart failure, because there is abundant literature detailing the importance of rest and comfort for the patient, reduction of solute load, and administration of digitalis and diuretics. Instead, we have sought to emphasize the therapeutic interventions that are aimed at changing the mechanical loading conditions of the heart. Treatment expectations must be viewed within an age- or maturity-dependent framework. Thus, when a preterm or full-term newborn infant requires cardiocirculatory support, diminished cardiac reserve limits the benefits derived from diverse treatment methods. This unique fragility of the developing heart and circulation places a premium on the astute manipulation of all of the factors that determine optimum cardiovascular adaptation to stress. Beyond infancy, although cardiovascular reserve increases, it remains imperative to modify therapy by using cardioactive drugs that deal specifically with the separate mechanical and contractile variables to assure optimum survival.", 
    "1": "In 69 hypertensive with suspected renovascular hypertension the response of plasma renin and angiotensin I to a single oral dose of Captopril (Captopril test) was determined. In 15 of the 16 patients found to have renal artery stenosis at angiography and cured by either revascularization or nephrectomy, Captopril stimulated both plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin I to a far greater extent than in the majority of the 53 classified as essential hypertensives. False positives were limited to 8. Sensitivity and specificity were 94% and 85%, respectively. In the same series sequential renal angiophotoscan showed 100% sensitivity but a lower specificity (75%). In comparison, both the sensitivity and the specificity of rapid-sequence intravenous pielography, isotopic renogram and recumbent plasma renin activity were far less satisfactory. It is concluded that this simple, safe and economical test should be preferred to the other diagnostic procedures in the screening of renovascular hypertension. Its use in combination with renal angiophotoscan improves diagnostic reliability.", 
    "2": "Affinity labeled analogues and partial sequences of the bradykinin potentiating nonapeptide BPP9 alpha inhibit the BPP9 alpha induced potentiation of the bradykinin action on the isolated guinea pig ileum. The labeled nonapeptides are more active than the labeled partial sequences. The inhibition of the potentiating action of BPP9 alpha demonstrates, that the influence on bradykinin action is not only a result of the inhibition of peptidyl dipeptide hydrolase.", 
    "3": "Nineteen patients with unilateral cerebrovascular disease underwent cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements; ten had been receiving conventional therapy and then were studied after treatment with captopril without or with a diuretic and nine on conventional therapy were studied twice as a control group. CBF (ml min-1) was measured after an intravenous injection of 99Tcm-labelled patient's red cells with a computer linked gamma camera over the vertex and a probe over the aorta. With deconvolution analysis regional CBF is given by regional cerebral volume divided by regional mean transit time. Results in the captopril group showed on average a 10% fall in mean blood pressure and a 10% rise in blood flow to the affected hemisphere. In the control group there was on average a 4% fall in pressure, together with an 11% fall in CBF to the affected hemisphere. Captopril appears to maintain autoregulation in cerebrovascular disease.", 
    "4": "Pressor responses to exogenous arginine vasopressin were assessed in adult rats that had been treated neonatally with capsaicin or its vehicle. Measurements were made under control conditions, after inhibition of baroreflexes (with pentolinium), and after inhibition of baroreflexes (with pentolinium) and the production of angiotensin II (with captopril). Resting arterial blood pressures and pressor sensitivities to exogenous arginine vasopressin were similar in capsaicin-treated and vehicle-injected rats. Sixty minutes after the administration of pentolinium, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced in both groups of rats and the pressor responses to arginine vasopressin were similarly and significantly enhanced. In both groups of rats 60 min after administration of pentolinium and captopril, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower than in the presence of pentolinium alone, but pressor responses were not different from those seen in control conditions. The possibility that the present results are explicable in terms of baroreflexes, the renin-angiotensin system and endogenous vasopressin interacting to influence the pressor sensitivity to exogenous vasopressin is discussed. From the present findings, it seems that our previous observation of impaired, vasopressin-mediated blood pressure recovery following acute hypotension in capsaicin-treated rats cannot be attributed to a reduced pressor sensitivity to the hormone.", 
    "5": "Forty-five hypertensive patients, 28 women and 17 men, age range between 35 and 65 years (mean 50 years), with blood pressures which current therapy did not succeed to control, were submitted to several examinations in order to identify the cause of their hypertension. We found isolated or combined abnormal values of aldosterone, renin, calcium and or potassium as the only alterations in 19 patients. We distinguished 4 groups descretionally classified according to biochemical alterations: renin and aldosterone increase, renin increase, aldosterone increase, calcium and or potassium reduction. The therapy used, intentionally aimed at the correction of the biochemical alterations found. Normal blood pressure was achieved in all patients and simultaneously the biochemical alterations also became normal in patients with isolated hyperreninemia, with combined hyperreninemia and hyperaldosteronemia and in those with hypocalcemia and or hypopotassemia. In patients were only isolated hyperaldosteronemia was found, this condition returned to normal in all except one. We suggest that besides the disturbances in sodium distribution other electrolytes or biochemical alterations may also play an equally important role in regulating, and sustaining essential hypertension.", 
    "6": "Many epidemiological studies have shown up the frequent association of arterial hypertension (HT) with atherosclerosis of different localizations. However, many of the drugs used to treat HT are contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD), because they cause unfavorable metabolic changes or vasoconstriction. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a proven hypotensive drug, captopril, on the peripheral circulation. The drug appeared to be effective in improving blood flow to lower limbs, prolonging the pain. Free interval and increasing the angle/arm arterial pressure index.", 
    "7": "Pathophysiology, outcome and some therapeutic problems of hypertension were described. Frequency of secondary hypertension and its underlying diseases in a hypertensive population greatly varied by study population. In the adult general population (Hisayama study) it was estimated to be 3.8%. Significance of various tests was evaluated in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Consideration of sodium balance in the evaluation was very necessary. The usefulness of captopril test was emphasized. Blood pressure was tended to decrease in upright posture and ambulation in cases with essential hypertension responding to acute sodium depletion by a significant reduction in blood pressure. In the observation of diurnal rhythm of urinary sodium excretion, the peak phase appeared about 3 hours earlier in essential hypertension than in normal control and 5 to 6 hours later in primary aldosteronism and Cushing syndrome. Sympathoadrenal function was activated in young borderline hypertensives but not in middle-aged ones. Outcome of hypertension accompanying diabetes mellitus was poor. Cardiovascular disease and renal failure occurred much frequently. Significance of hypertension as a risk factor of cardiovascular disease was described based on the data obtained through prospective epidemiological study (Hisayama Study). Hypertension was significantly correlated with stroke but not with myocardial infarction. Serum cholesterol level did not significantly correlate with both stroke and myocardial infarction. Reduction in stroke incidence in recent years was described in relation to the changes in risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. Pathophysiology and outcome of malignant hypertension (KW III-IV) were described in relation to underlying disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "In 14 hypertensives the effect of captopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) treatment on red blood cell Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ concentrations and on plasma Zn2+ concentrations were studied. Intraerythrocytic Zn2+ concentrations increased slightly, whereas plasma zinc concentrations decreased. The concurrence of hypozincemia with side effects resembling the symptoms of zinc deficiency such as loss of smell and taste suggests a role of alterations in zinc metabolism for the pharmacodynamics of captopril.", 
    "9": "The effects of intracerebroventricular (IVT) infusion of angiotensin II (ANG II), the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881, and dopamine were studied in 15 conscious Na-depleted sheep. IVT ANG II (25 ng/min) significantly increased plasma aldosterone (163 +/- 24%) and vasopressin (ADH) (533 +/- 100%). Plasma renin activity (PRA) was decreased to 64 +/- 10% of basal. IVT SQ (1 microgram/min) decreased aldosterone to 70 +/- 10% and ADH to 55 +/- 9% of basal. PRA increased to 124 +/- 10%. There were no significant changes in plasma Na, K, or cortisol levels nor in mean arterial or intracranial pressure after either infusion. Increasing the dose of SQ to 10 micrograms/min resulted in an increased magnitude of change in the same variables. IVT SQ (1 microgram/min) significantly decreased aldosterone level in five nephrectomized sheep. The responses to IVT dopamine (20 micrograms/min) were qualitatively similar to those elicited by IVT SQ. These data support the existence of an endogenous brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) independent of the renal RAS. ANG II acts centrally to regulate plasma ADH, aldosterone, and PRA levels. The similarity of the responses to SQ and dopamine suggests that a dopaminergic pathway may be involved in these responses.", 
    "10": "The use of captopril in 19 patients with renal parenchymal disease and refractory hypertension was studied for a mean period of 12 months. There was a significant reduction in the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, with a reduction in the mean arterial pressure of 29 mmHg. The mean maintenance dose of captopril was 142 mg daily in three divided doses. All but one of the patients required a diuretic for satisfactory blood pressure control and 3 patients were also given a beta-blocker. In all patients a simplification of the previous therapeutic regimen was achieved. A significant rise in serum creatinine was noted in 2 patients, one of whom had to be withdrawn from the study. Despite the presence of renal functional impairment, proteinuria did not occur de novo nor did established proteinuria increase. Leukopenia was noted in any of the patients in this group.", 
    "11": "The reduction of angiotensin II production by captopril--an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor--could suppress hyperaldosteronism without impairment of renal function and could thereby be useful in the treatment of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Systemic and renal hemodynamics and renal function were studied in 6 nonazotemic patients with cirrhosis and ascites with a low-sodium diet before and after oral administration of 25 mg of captopril. Cardiac output and renal blood flow did not change significantly after administration of captopril, whereas mean arterial pressure significantly decreased. Systemic and renal vascular resistances were significantly reduced. There was a statistically significant reduction of glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, and urinary output. Plasma renin activity significantly increased in all patients after administration of captopril. A statistically significant correlation was found between the decrease in mean arterial pressure and the reduction of glomerular filtration, but no relationship was found between basal values of plasma renin activity and the other observed variations. We concluded that captopril mainly induces hypotension due to an increase in renal vasodilatation in ascitic patients with cirrhosis.", 
    "12": "Fractionation of Triton-solubilized rat brain membranes on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose resolves two peptidases which hydrolyze beta-neo-endorphin. One of these peptidases was identified as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme by (a) its sensitivity to inhibition by the specific inhibitors MK422 and captopril, (b) by the identification of reaction products, and (c) by comparison to authentic angiotensin converting enzyme. In contrast, alpha-neo-endorphin hydrolysis by angiotensin converting enzyme could not be detected. The second enzyme active on beta-neo-endorphin was identified as an aminopeptidase. This aminopeptidase is identical to the previously described enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidase. The possible involvement of these enzymes in the metabolism of opioid peptides is discussed.", 
    "13": "The in vitro conversion of enalapril (MK421) to enalaprilic acid (MK422) in human autopsy tissues was examined. MK422 was measured by radioimmunoassay. Human cadaver liver was the only tissue in which significant conversion was demonstrated. The esterase activity was stable after post mortem. Autopsy liver tissues from patients with elevated ante mortem liver function tests were found to have a reduced rate of deesterification.", 
    "14": "The dose-response relationship of enalapril was evaluated in a double-blind, balanced, two-period, incomplete-block study in 91 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Patients were randomly assigned to two of six treatments: placebo, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/day of enalapril maleate. There were two 3-week treatment periods, each preceded by a 4-week, single-blind placebo washout. Each dose of enalapril produced significant decreases in standing and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 2 and 3 weeks of treatment. There were no significant changes on placebo. There was a significant linear dose response relationship for both mean blood pressure and mean change from baseline in blood pressure (P less than 0.01 for systolic and mean arterial pressure, and P less than 0.05 for diastolic pressure). Enalapril was associated with an increasing dose-response relationship across the 2.5-40 mg/day range. The 2.5 mg/dose is effective in some patients; however, doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/day may be necessary to achieve satisfactory blood pressure control.", 
    "15": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between serum lipase (LP), serum immunoreactive trypsin (IRT), and its inhibitors in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of diverse origin and to compare their time course with other acute conditions. The IRT and LP levels were determined at regular intervals in 41 patients hospitalized in the intensive respiratory unit with ARDS (n = 9), acute pancreatitis (n = 5), shock (n = 9), bronchopneumonia (n = 10), or acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (n = 8). Several trypsin inhibitors were measured simultaneously: serum trypsin inhibitory capacity (TIC), alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and antithrombin III. Concomitantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was determined as a potential marker of the endothelial injury. A respective 19- and 13-fold increase in IRT and LP values were observed in patients with ARDS after a mean evolution of 6 days; similar increases were seen in patients with pancreatitis. These values were significantly higher than those observed in the other conditions studied. In patients with ARDS and acute pancreatitis, the evolution of IRT and LP values were associated with a sixfold rise in TIC. A low TIC/IRT ratio in patients with ARDS appeared to be an index of poor prognosis. Conversely, ACE activity evolution was characterized by an early decrease in all the conditions studied. These observations indicate that there is an acute delayed pancreas injury in ARDS. Thus, the release of pancreatic enzymes are not reliable markers of the early evolution of the disease but they may represent secondary mediators for enhancement of the increased endothelial permeability.", 
    "16": "Small peptide analogues representing the C-terminal portion of angiotensin I sequence were designed as inhibitors of human renin. Among synthesized compounds, benzyloxycarbonyl (-\"Z\")-(1-naphthyl)Ala-His-leucinal (ES-188), Z-(1-naphthyl)Ala-His-statine ethyl ester (ES-226), and Z-(1-naphthyl)Ala-His-statine 2-methylbutylamide (ES-254) markedly inhibited human and primate renins (inhibitory concentration, 50% [IC50], near 10(-7) M). These peptide analogues inhibited rabbit renin with one or two orders of magnitude less potency. They were very weak inhibitors of renins from pig, goat, dog, and rat. ES-188 had no discernible effect on cathepsin D, pepsin, or human angiotensin-converting enzyme at the concentration of 10(-4)M. ES-226 had little effect on the three enzymes at the concentration of 10(-5)M; however, ES-254 had a considerable inhibitory effect on cathepsin D (IC50 of 1.4 X 10(-5)M), pepsin (IC50 of 4.2 X 10(-5)M), and human angiotensin-converting enzyme (IC50 of 7.1 X 10(-6)M). Our results indicate that 1-naphthylalanine-containing tripeptide analogues are highly potent human renin inhibitors.", 
    "17": "While renin is a highly specific protease, converting enzyme has at least two principal substrates, angiotensin I and bradykinin. Changes in the rate of formation of angiotensin II or degradation of bradykinin can influence the hypotensive action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The present study was designed to determine if there were differences in the maximal blood pressure reduction in Na-deficient dogs after angiotensin converting enzyme or renin inhibitor treatment. Five conscious dogs received 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg of i.v. enalaprilat, a potent angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, which reduced blood pressure to 75 +/- 4, 71 +/- 5, and 71 +/- 5 mm Hg. Plasma immunoreactive angiotensin II levels were reduced in a dose-related fashion to 35% of control level at the highest dose. Infusion of a maximally effective dose of a statine-containing renin inhibitor (SCRIP) with the high dose of enalaprilat produced no further fall in blood pressure (68 +/- 7 mm Hg), but immunoreactive angiotensin II levels fell to essentially zero in four of five dogs. The order of drug administration was reversed in another experiment in a group of nine dogs in which SCRIP reduced plasma immunoreactive angiotensin II to 25% of control at 0.04 mg/kg/minute (n = 5), with reduction to near zero levels at higher doses. Maximal blood pressure reduction was achieved at 0.32 to 0.64 mg/kg/minute (76 +/- 4 mm Hg); 1 mg/kg of enalaprilat lowered blood pressure an additional 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) while not further decreasing immunoreactive angiotensin II levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "The response of renin release to the administration of renin inhibitors cannot be studied with conventional enzymatic methods used to measure plasma renin. In the present experiments, a novel multirange enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human and primate renin was used to investigate the changes in plasma immunoreactive renin after renin inhibition. A potent and long-acting statine-containing renin inhibitor, CGP 29 287, was injected in conscious marmosets after mild or severe sodium depletion. In mildly sodium-depleted marmosets, CGP 29 287 (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) reduced mean arterial blood pressure and completely inhibited plasma renin activity for up to 30 minutes. This response was associated with a transient increase in plasma immunoreactive renin concentration. After a dose of 1.0 mg/kg i.v., the reduction of mean arterial pressure and the complete inhibition of plasma renin activity persisted for up to 120 minutes. These effects were accompanied by a sustained increase in plasma immunoreactive renin concentration. In severely sodium-depleted marmosets, CGP 29 287 (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) induced a marked fall in systolic blood pressure and complete inhibition of plasma renin activity within 30 minutes of injection. Plasma immunoreactive renin levels increased to 257% of pretreatment values. The converting-enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (2 mg/kg i.v.) induced a fall in systolic blood pressure of similar magnitude, which was accompanied by an increase in plasma renin activity. Levels of plasma immunoreactive renin increased to 210% of pretreatment values. Hydralazine (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) did not increase plasma renin activity or plasma immunoreactive renin levels despite a comparable hypotensive effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "To measure specifically angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide, peptides were extracted from 2 ml of plasma by reversible adsorption to bonded-phase silica. The angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide was then isolated by isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and quantified by radioimmunoassay. The extraction recovery of 125I-angiotensin II added to 2 ml of plasma was 99 +/- 2% (mean +/- SD). The overall recovery of 5, 10, and 20 fmol unlabeled angiotensin II added to 1 ml of plasma was 80 +/- 10%. The coefficient of variation for within-assay precision was 0.06 and for between-assay precision 0.13. The detection limit was 0.4 fmol/ml. Buffer and plasma blanks were below the detection limit. Normal subjects on a free diet in supine position averaged 4.2 +/- 1.7 fmol/ml angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide. Furosemide (40 mg p.o.) and standing increased these values to 22 +/- 7.6 fmol/ml. In four volunteers, immunoreactive \"angiotensin II\" (more or less angiotensin-like material) was measured serially before and after converting-enzyme inhibition (Hoe 498) with conventional Dowex extraction. At peak inhibition, plasma immunoreactive \"angiotensin II\" levels decreased by only 44%. In contrast, angiotensin-(1-8)-octapeptide isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography completely disappeared. In hypertensive patients receiving long-term treatment with enalapril, plasma levels of angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide fell from 2.7 +/- 0.9 to 0.9 +/- 0.3 fmol/ml (mean +/- SEM) 2 hours after the morning dose, whereas levels of immunoreactive \"angiotensin II\" were not significantly changed. We found that this sensitive method specifically measured angiotensin-(1-8)octapeptide and demonstrated that true angiotensin II virtually disappears during converting-enzyme inhibition.", 
    "20": "Systemic infection with Histoplasma capsulatum induced a granulomatous inflammatory response in the lymphoreticular organs of C57BL/6 mice that was associated with elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the spleens. To determine the influence of ACE on the granulomatous response, either captopril or MK 421, two inhibitors of ACE, were administered intraperitoneally to mice 6 h after intravenous injection of H. capsulatum and then daily for 1 week. Each ACE inhibitor sharply reduced ACE activity in the spleens of infected mice. Both drugs worsened the clinical severity of infection and significantly increased the growth of H. capsulatum in livers and spleens of mice infected for 1 week. The histopathological changes in mice given captopril were more severe, with massive infiltrates of macrophages in proximity to large aggregates of yeasts. Conversely, the administration of captopril for 2 weeks during the resolving phases of infection did not slow the healing of the granulomatous lesions, nor did it provoke a relapse of infection. Captopril did not promote the growth of H. capsulatum in artificial medium. This drug was not cytotoxic to peripheral blood leukocytes or to splenic leukocytes from normal and infected mice. Administration of captopril to normal mice for 1 week did not depress the response of splenocytes of concanavalin A or to phytohemagglutinin, nor did it diminish delayed-type hypersensitivity responses in vivo. Finally, captopril did not augment the growth of H. capsulatum within macrophages. Our results suggest that ACE may participate in the regulation of the granulomatous inflammatory response to H. capsulatum and that ACE inhibition impairs the protective effects of granulomatous inflammation during acute H. capsulatum infection.", 
    "21": "Over the past decade we have witnessed a metamorphosis in the treatment of hypertension. First, nonpharmacological modalities are employed and are followed by a stepped-care program with pharmacological entities including diuretic, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking, antiadrenergic, angiotensin-inhibiting, and vasodilating agents. Precisely how beta-adrenergic blocking drugs reduce arterial pressure still remains to be elucidated, and we still do not understand precisely how the diuretics, direct-acting smooth muscle relaxants, or even the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors work. Nevertheless, it is clear that clinical studies directed toward these questions as well as toward other new classes of antihypertensive agents (including how the calcium-entry blockers, serotonin inhibitors, and others affect vascular smooth muscle contractility) should provide continued enlightenment as to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of essential hypertension.", 
    "22": "Unclipping the one-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rat during a free flow of urine caused the blood pressure to return to normal levels within about 3 hours. We found that administration of captopril plus unclipping caused the blood pressure to return to normal in minutes (17 +/- 4). Ureterocaval anastomosis plus captopril plus unclipping also caused the blood pressure to return to normal in minutes (8.8 +/- 2). Thus, the potentiation of the drop in blood pressure does not seem to be due to a volume effect. Administration of indomethacin and aprotinin did not prevent a rapid decline of the blood pressure after unclipping, but the decline was less rapid than that occurring after captopril and unclipping, which suggests that prostaglandin may have some effect on this mechanism. Saralasin administration did not potentiate the antihypertensive action of captopril plus unclipping. Chemical papillectomy prevented the drop in blood pressure after unclipping. The bolus dose of captopril to the hypertensive rat often caused a transient depressor effect resembling that due to the antihypertensive neutral renomedullary lipid, which suggests secretion of this lipid into the blood. The renomedullary interstitial cells accumulated large lipid granules after captopril administration. These cells also degranulated after unclipping. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the renal papilla secretes an antihypertensive hormone after unclipping. At present, antihypertensive neutral renomedullary lipid is the main putative hormone.", 
    "23": "Cilazapril is the monoethyl ester prodrug form of a potent, specific. long-acting antihypertensive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The biochemical and pharmacological properties of this compound have been compared with those of captopril and enalapril. In all test systems, cilazapril was the most potent and the longest acting. The active diacid of cilazapril was more potent than the corresponding diacid of enalapril in inhibiting the cleavage of angiotensin I and of Hip-His-Leu by ACE in vitro, in antagonising the angiotensin I-induced contractions of the isolated ileum of the guinea pig, in potentiating the vasodepressor responses to bradykinin, and in reducing the angiotensin I-induced rise in blood pressure of the rat. Parent drug absorption and diacid bioavailability in the rat were higher than for enalapril, and the inhibition of plasma ACE of longer duration. Single doses of cilazapril were more potent than enalapril in lowering the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and two-kidney renal hypertensive rats. On repeated daily oral dosing to SHR, both compounds had a cumulative antihypertensive effect. The acute antihypertensive effect was enhanced by simultaneous treatment with hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "24": "Aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester, is a widely used artificIal sweetener. In humans and other animals aspartame is initially hydrolyzed to L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine by intestinal esterases. L-Aspartyl-L-phenylalanine inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme purified from rabbit lungs with a Ki of 11 +/- 2 microM, equipotent to the IC50 of 12 microM for 2-D-methyl-succinyl-L-proline which has been reported to be an orally active antihypertensive agent in rats. Thus the possibility exists that L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme in humans consuming large quantities of aspartame. Both aspartame itself and the diketopiperazine formed from it, 3-carboxymethyl-6-benzyl-2,5-diketopiperazine, are weak inhibitors with Ki's greater than 1 mM.", 
    "25": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are useful antihypertensive agents. Enalapril maleate is a new ACE inhibitor with actions similar to those of captopril but with fewer side-effects. A study was conducted on 19 black South Africans with mild or moderate essential hypertension; enalapril was compared with propranolol as monotherapy or together with hydrochlorothiazide in a 1-year randomized, double-blind, parallel study. Neither enalapril nor propranolol alone produced consistent, significant reductions in blood pressure. There were no significant differences between the blood pressure responses to enalapril and to propranolol (either with or without hydrochlorothiazide). It is concluded that neither enalapril nor propranolol is effective as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension in South African blacks, but that both require the addition of a thiazide diuretic.", 
    "26": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) potentiated significantly the inhibitory effect of the thromboxane A2 antagonist L-640,035 (1 mg/kg i.v.) on electrically induced platelet accumulation in the rabbit in vivo. Enalapril had no effect upon platelet accumulation when given alone. The hypotensive effects of enalapril did not account for the potentiation because a combination of hexamethonium (5 mg/kg i.v.) and hydralazine (1 mg/kg i.v.), which decreased blood pressure similarly to enalapril, did not augment the effect of L-640,035. Determination by radioimmunoassay of plasma levels of immunoreactive 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, suggested that increases in PGI2 levels after combined administration of enalapril and L-640,035 could explain the observed potentiation.", 
    "27": "In three patients with primary aldosteronism, the acute effect of a single dose of captopril on the elevated mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was studied before and after 4 weeks of treatment with spironolactone. Before spironolactone therapy, captopril did not cause any drop in MAP. Four weeks later, after an oral daily dose of 400 mg spironolactone, MAP was still elevated in all three patients, though electrolyte abnormalities were fully corrected. Since plasma renin activity (PRA) was increased to values above the normal range, the acute effect of captopril on MAP was tested again. A single dose of 25 mg captopril then caused a fall in MAP to normal. These data reveal the conversion from a renin-independent to a renin-dependent kind of hypertension after spironolactone therapy in three patients with primary aldosteronism syndrome. This might be of pathogenetic and therapeutic interest.", 
    "28": "We examined the effects of captopril on prolidase activity of crude homogenates of various tissues in the rat and in the human. It was found that captopril caused significant inhibition of prolidases from liver, kidney, and intestine in both species, whereas it showed minimal inhibitory effect on erythrocyte prolidase. In the rat, Ki for the inhibition of kidney and liver prolidases was in the range of 25-35 microM while, in the human, the value was considerably higher. The nature of inhibition was found to be competitive both in the rat and in the human. Oral administration of captopril (daily dose, 40 mg/kg) for 7 days in the rat resulted in increased urinary excretion of peptide-bound 4-hydroxy-L-proline compared to controls, indicating in vivo inhibition of tissue prolidases by captopril.", 
    "29": "Vasodilator drugs counteract the major haemodynamic abnormality of hypertension, namely, arteriolar constriction. As a group, they tend to cause tachycardia and fluid retention, but these side-effects are variable within the group. Vasodilator drugs are effective in the treatment of the whole range of hypertensive diseases, from severe refractory hypertension to mild hypertension. With increasing recognition of the necessity of treatment in mild asymptomatic hypertension, those vasodilator drugs which can be used on their own, such as prazosin and calcium antagonists, are attractive as initial therapy, because they do not have adverse effects on the levels of atherogenic lipids and other risk factors for vascular disease. The major current use of vasodilator drugs in combination with a thiazide and a beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drug is in the treatment of moderate-to-severe hypertension.", 
    "30": "In nine patients with severe, treatment-resistant heart failure (stages IV in the NYHA classification) the acute and long-term effect of captopril were studied. In the acute experiment, peripheral resistance fell by 27% after administration of 25 mg captopril, cardiac index rose by 25%, arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure and mean right atrial pressure fell by a similar amount. This haemodynamic improvement increased slightly in the course of longterm treatment (cardiac index +30%, peripheral resistance -30%, mean pulmonary arterial pressure -42%). The fall in heart rate by 15% and 25%, respectively, was an expression of haemodynamic improvement and reduction in angiotensin II. The fall in peripheral vascular resistance coincided with a 50% reduction in angiotensin II concentration. Over the longer term, 2-42 weeks, the renin system stimulation regressed with the improvement in haemodynamics. Four of the nine patients in stage IV improved to stage II, while the remaining five patients improved from IV to III.", 
    "31": "The use of fluoro ketones as inhibitors of hydrolytic enzymes has been investigated. The acetylcholine analogues 6,6-dimethyl-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-heptanone and 3,3-difluoro-6,6-dimethyl-2-heptanone are inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase with Ki values of 16 X 10(-9) M and 1.6 X 10(-9) M, respectively. These fluoro ketones are 10(4)-10(5) times better as inhibitors than the corresponding methyl ketone. Since nucleophiles readily add to fluoro ketones, it is likely that these compounds inhibit acetylcholinesterase by formation of a stable hemiketal with the active-site serine residue. Fluoro ketone substrate analogues are also inhibitors of zinc metallo- and aspartylproteases. 2-Benzyl-4-oxo-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic acid is an inhibitor of carboxypeptidase A (Ki = 2 X 10(-7) M). Trifluoromethyl ketone dipeptide analogues are good inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme. An analogue of pepstatin that contains a difluorostatone residue in place of statine has been prepared and found to be an extremely potent inhibitor of pepsin (Ki = 6 X 10(-11) M). The hydrated ketones are probably the inhibitory species since they are structural mimics of the tetrahedral intermediate that forms during the hydrolysis of peptide substrates.", 
    "32": "Two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt models were produced in Wistar rats by placing a stenotic clip around the left renal artery. The animals were classified into three groups according to the time when captopril was started. In group 1 rats captopril was begun on the day following the operation and was continued for 6 weeks. During this period hypertension did not develop. In group 2 in which captopril was started 4 weeks after placement of the renal arterial clip, the blood pressure remained high as late as 12 weeks despite of continued administration of the drug. However, in group 3, captopril which was started 12 weeks postoperatively was very effective in correcting high blood pressure. In the sham operated group the blood pressure was unchanged by captopril administration. These results suggest that the role of renin-angiotensin system seems to vary according to the stages of experimental hypertension and that at least in the acute and chronic stage of two-kidney one-clip Goldblatt hypertension angiotensin II may play a major role in initiation and maintenance of high blood pressure.", 
    "33": "Oral administration of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril produced a substantial reduction of blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. After oral administration of captopril (30 mg/kg), mean blood pressure decreased from 172 +/- 11 to 148 +/- 9 mmHg (P less than 0.01) in one hour and its antihypertensive effects lasted for the next seven hours. Plasma vasopressin levels showed a marked elevation in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats compared with control values (22 +/- 5 versus 5 +/- 3 pg/ml). This increase in vasopressin was significantly reduced by captopril from 25 +/- 5 to 8 +/- 6 pg/ml. In addition, whole body vascular reactivity to norepinephrine was examined. Responsiveness was at first attenuated but returned to control value in spite of reduction of both plasma vasopressin and blood pressure. Thus, captopril reduces blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats and the fall in blood pressure is accompanied by reduction of plasma vasopressin and attenuation of vascular reactivity.", 
    "34": "Captopril is a new orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor that is useful for the treatment of hypertension. Prior reports have cautioned against its use for the control of blood pressure in patients with transplant renal artery stenosis since it caused a reversible renal failure. We describe a four year old child with radiographically proven transplant renal artery stenosis and severe hypertension that was safely managed with long-term administration of captopril. This case highlights the continued therapeutic role of this drug in the treatment of post-transplant hypertension, provided one carefully monitors the renal function in such patients.", 
    "35": "Plasma ions and cortisol levels were measured sequentially during the adaptation of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) from fresh water (FW) to sea water (SW). The importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of this adaptation was assessed using captopril (SQ14225, an inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme). The effects of captopril on renal function in FW- and SW-adapted trout were also examined. During the first 5 hr in sea water, plasma levels of cortisol in eels increased threefold, plasma sodium rose steadily from 137 to 156 mmol/l and plasma potassium fell from 2.1 to 1.6 mmol/l. In contrast, captopril-treated eels when adapted to sea water had plasma cortisol levels twice those of controls. Captopril treatment did not affect the electrolyte responses to seawater adaptation. Captopril injected into eels which were fully adapted to and wholly maintained in sea water had no effect on plasma levels of cortisol, sodium, and potassium. Plasma cortisol was 30% lower in freshwater eels 2 hr after an injection of captopril but plasma sodium and potassium levels were unchanged. In both FW- and SW-adapted trout, captopril infusions doubled the glomerular filtration and urine production rates and the tubular transport maxima for glucose without changes in plasma composition.", 
    "36": "The contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the cardiovascular response to exercise was studied in 12 patients with congestive heart failure. The haemodynamic effects of captopril were measured at rest and during supine bicycle exercise. After captopril administration, resting systemic vascular resistance fell by 26.6% and mean blood pressure by 16.7% and cardiac index increased by 19.7%. During exercise, captopril decreased systemic vascular resistance by 25.6% and mean blood pressure by 8.2% and increased cardiac index by 24.4%. Pulmonary wedge pressure fell by 25% at rest but was not altered by captopril during exercise. Pretreatment plasma renin activity increased from 13.4(16.0) ng/ml/hr (10.3(12.3) mmol/l/hr) at rest to 20.0(27.8) ng/ml/hr (15.4(21.4) mmol/l/hr) during exercise. Pretreatment plasma noradrenaline concentration increased from 659(433) pg/ml (39(25.6) nmol/l) at rest to 2622(1486) pg/ml during exercise (155(88) nmol/l). Captopril favourably alters systemic vascular resistance and cardiac index during exercise in patients with congestive heart failure. This may reflect inhibition of the increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system during exercise in these patients and a subsequent reduction in systemic vasoconstriction.", 
    "37": "The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of bombesin on mean arterial pressure and heart rate were studied in conscious, freely moving rats. Injection of bombesin produced dose-dependent elevations of mean arterial pressure and reductions of heart rate. These effects were not caused by leakage of bombesin into the peripheral circulation. Adrenalectomy abolished the pressor action of bombesin but did not alter bombesin-induced bradycardia. Systemic phentolamine pretreatment prevented bombesin-induced changes of mean arterial pressure, whereas rats treated intravenously with captopril or a vasopressin antagonist still exhibited pressor responses to bombesin administration. Bombesin-induced bradycardia was partially antagonized by intravenous atropine methyl nitrate administration, whereas systemic injections of propranolol did not modify this response. It is concluded that bombesin acts within the central nervous system to elevate mean arterial pressure through an adrenal-dependent mechanism involving alpha-adrenergic receptors and to reduce heart rate through an adrenal-independent mechanism involving, at least in part, cardiac parasympathetic nervous activation.", 
    "38": "Chronic dietary administration of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (1.0 g/kg food), induced an appetite for 0.15 M NaCl solution relative to distilled water in a two-bottle ad libitum access paradigm. Graded doses of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) were administered to the captopril-treated rats via Silastic tubes implanted sc. A U-shaped dose-response relationship was observed between dose of DOCA and intake of 0.15 M NaCl solution. The lowest intake of NaCl occurred with a dose of 102.1 micrograms DOCA/day (333 micrograms/kg X day). Water and food intakes were not affected significantly. At the end of the first week of treatment with DOCA, pilocarpine (3.0 mg/kg, ip.)-stimulated salivary chloride concentration was measured. The relationship between salivary chloride concentration and mean intake of 0.15 M NaCl solution was also U shaped, with the minimal NaCl intake associated with a salivary chloride concentration of 54 meq/liter. During the second week of treatment with DOCA, all rats were offered a choice between 0.25 M NaCl solution and distilled water. Rats receiving DOCA at doses of 102.1 micrograms/day or greater had a significantly lower intake of NaCl solution than those receiving either captopril alone or 66.5 micrograms DOCA/day in combination with captopril. These results indicate that the appetite for NaCl solution induced by captopril can be inhibited by concurrent administration of DOCA. They also suggest that changes in the concentration of electrolytes in saliva may be associated with changes in the appetite for NaCl solution.", 
    "39": "It is now possible to accurately identify patients with renovascular hypertension who need renal angioplasty or revascularization. Evaluation does not require hospitalization and begins with the determination of an ambulatory plasma renin activity (PRA) indexed against sodium excretion and a captopril test. Subsequently differential renal vein renins with matching inferior vena caval (IVC) renins are measured often with converting enzyme inhibition. Identifying criteria are as follows: (1) high PRA indexed against sodium excretion, (2) hypersecretion of renin following captopril administration, (3) absence of renin secretion from the contralateral kidney, and (4) an ipsilateral renal vein renin increment at least 50% greater than the matching IVC renin. Patients who meet the criteria are admitted for percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty.", 
    "40": "We report here a familial clustering of elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels. The patient is a 58-year-old Japanese female who had been in excellent health until age 45 when she developed an occlusion of the left central retinal vein. She was otherwise in excellent health, and no laboratory abnormality except a marked elevation of serum ACE level (625 nmol/min/ml; normal range; 22-40 nmol/min/ml of serum) was found. Her blood pressure was within normal limits (140/80 mmHg). There was no evidence for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, Gaucher's disease, leprosy, hyperthyroidism, diabetic retinopathy, or liver disease. One of her two sisters also showed a marked increase in serum ACE activity (303 nmol/min/ml), and remarkably high levels of serum ACE (276 and 294 nmol/min/ml) were demonstrated in both sons of this sister. All the members of this family have been in excellent health. The serum ACE activity was activated by chloride and cobalt ions, and inhibited by EDTA, captopril and rabbit antiserum to purified human plasma ACE. Thus our study showed a familial clustering of elevated serum ACE in individuals who did not have conventional disease patterns associated with elevated serum ACE.", 
    "41": "Thirty-four ACE inhibitors were evaluated to determine the concentration giving 50% inhibition of purified rabbit lung ACE (IC50 microM) using benzyloxycarboxyl-p-NO2-Phe-His-Leu as substrate, to determine the oral dose causing a lowering in blood pressure of 30 mm Hg (ED30 mumol/kg) in acute aortic coarctate (AAC) rats, and to determine inhibition of plasma ACE (PACE) activity in mice after oral dosing. Mouse PACE activity was determined with 14C-Hip-His-Leu as substrate one hour after oral dosing of 3 animals/group with 5 or 50 mumol ACE inhibitor per kg. Data from mice were expressed as percent of control group PACE activity. Least squares regression analysis showed the IC50 data to be poorly correlated with either rat data or mouse PACE data at 50 mumol/kg p.o. However, correlation was significant between log rat ED30 and mouse PACE at 5 (p less than 0.001, r = 0.570) and 50 (p less than 0.025, r = 0.387) mumol/kg p.o. Thus, the simple mouse plasma ACE determination after a dose of 5 mumol/kg is a convenient supplement to the AAC rat model for showing oral activity of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "42": "Captopril has a known hypotensive action derived from the inhibition of the converting enzyme (Kininase II). To investigate whether other mechanism may contribute to vasodilation, Na-K ATPase and Mg ATPase activities on ghost red blood cells membranes were examined in the presence of the drug. The results show a stimulation of Mg ATPase activity and an inhibition of Na-K ATPase activity in a concentration dependent manner. The latter action does not seem to be related to a vasodilator effect.", 
    "43": "Maximal workloads in supine and sitting bicycle stress tests were compared in 12 patients with congestive heart failure during long-term therapy with the vasodilator enalapril. The response to the therapy was observed with the supine and sitting bicycle stress tests and gated equilibrium ventriculography. The maximal workload was 68 W in the supine position and 84 W in the sitting position; the mean difference was 15 W. The difference was highly significant (P less than 0.001). Both the supine and sitting workloads were significantly higher (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.05) in the enalapril group than in the placebo group. The findings in the gated equilibrium ventriculography were not significantly different between the two groups.", 
    "44": "In 40-50% of patients with essential hypertension, a high sodium intake does not increase renal blood flow (RBF). These patients have been defined as nonmodulators because sodium intake does not modulate renal and adrenal responsiveness to angiotensin II (AII). To define the role of AII in mediating this altered responsiveness, we assessed the effect of a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) on RBF and its responsiveness to AII in 25 patients with essential hypertension--10 modulators and 15 nonmodulators--and 9 normotensive controls. After 5 d of a 200-meq sodium intake, the nonmodulators did not increase RBF, whereas the normotensives (79 +/- 28 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and modulators (75 +/- 26 ml/min per 1.73 m2) did (P less than 0.025). Arterial blood pressure did not change in the modulators with the salt loading, whereas in the nonmodulators, blood pressure rose (P less than 0.004). After enalapril administration for 66 h, there was a significant difference (P less than 0.01, Fisher Exact Test) in the blood pressure response in the two hypertensive subgroups. In the modulators, there was no change; in the nonmodulators, despite the high salt diet, a blood pressure reduction occurred. In parallel, basal RBF and RBF responsiveness to AII were not changed after converting enzyme inhibition in the normotensive control (n = 9) or the hypertensive modulators (n = 10). Conversely, in the nonmodulators (n = 14), the basal RBF increased significantly (83 +/- 25 ml/min per 1.73 m2; P = 0.01), the increment being indistinguishable from the response to salt loading in normal subjects. Furthermore, renovascular responsiveness to infused AII was also significantly enhanced (P = 0.027) in the nonmodulators, suggesting that enalapril-induced increase in RBF reflected a fall in intrarenal AII levels, and not an increase in prostaglandins or kinins, which would have blunted the renal response to AII. Thus, short-term converting enzyme inhibition corrected abnormalities in sodium-mediated modulation of renal vascular responsiveness to AII. The close quantitative relation of the increase in RBF with sodium loading in normal subjects and modulators, and with converting enzyme inhibition in nonmodulators, viewed in the context of the effectiveness of enalapril only in the latter, and parallel shifts in sensitivity to AII, raises the intriguing possibility that converting enzyme inhibition reversed the failure of the renal blood supply to respond to sodium loading. Thus, converting enzyme inhibitors may reduce blood pressure specifically in this subset of patients with essential hypertension, who are sodium sensitive by way of mechanisms more closely related to local than systemic activity of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "45": "Systemic and regional hemodynamics and cardiac structural changes were studied in 12 patients with mild to moderately severe essential hypertension before and then 90 minutes and 12 weeks after administration of captopril. Mean arterial pressure was reduced from 111 mm Hg to 96 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and this was mediated through a fall in total peripheral resistance from 26 +/- 2 units to 23 +/- 2 units (p less than 0.01). The decreased total peripheral resistance was distributed to all circulations studied: kidney, skeletal muscle, skin and the splanchnic organs. Furthermore, left ventricular (LV) mass index diminished without altering myocardial contractility at rest. Thus, captopril lowered arterial pressure through systemic arteriolar dilatation in patients with mild to moderately severe essential hypertension and also reduced LV mass even in patients without evidence of LV hypertrophy.", 
    "46": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, enalapril (5 to 20 mg twice daily) or captopril (25 to 100 mg thrice daily) and matching ACE inhibitor placebos were given to 32 moderate-to-severe essential hypertension patients who were already on 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily. Alpha-methyldopa (250 to 500 mg twice daily) was given to 16 patients following 6 weeks of ACE inhibitor therapy. Both enalapril and captopril significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered the supine and upright blood pressures (BPs) (acutely and long-term) without significant reflex heart rate changes. The BPs of enalapril patients were, however, significantly lower (supine diastolic p less than 0.03, supine systolic p less than 0.05, and upright diastolic p less than 0.04) than those of captopril patients when compared by repeated measures of analysis of variance. Eleven enalapril patients have been followed for 1 year with continued BP control. Skin rash occurred in one captopril patient and reversible renal insufficiency developed in two enalapril patients during the first 16 weeks. It is concluded that (although both ACE inhibitors lowered BP, enalapril was more effective than captopril and twice-daily enalapril was well tolerated during 52 weeks of treatment.", 
    "47": "The [R] and [S] enantiomers of the enkephalinase A inhibitor [R,S]-thiorphan have been prepared by asymmetric synthesis. The [S] isomer is principally responsible for the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory activity of [R,S]-thiorphan, whereas there were only small differences in the ability of the [R] and [S] isomers to inhibit enkephalinase both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, the in vivo analgesic activity of [R,S]-thiorphan resided principally in the [R] isomer. These data indicate a surprising dissociation of enkephalinase inhibition from analgesic activity. The fact that the two enantiomers of [R,S]-thiorphan were effective inhibitors of enkephalinase, yet the [R] isomer had substantially greater analgesic activity, indicates that factors other than enkephalinase inhibition may be important for [R, S]-thiorphan's analgesic properties.", 
    "48": "The synthesis and biological activity of a series of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) are described. Incorporation of the substituted N-carboxymethyl dipeptide design of enalapril (MK-421) into acyl tripeptides and larger peptides yielded potent inhibitors of the enzyme. These can be viewed as substrate analogues in which the carbonyl of the scissile peptide bond is replaced by a CHCO2H group. Several of the analogues described possess inhibitory potency equal to that of enalaprilat (MK-422), but none achieves an increase in potency which would demonstrate additional binding interactions contributed by the extended peptide chain. Application of the design described may be useful for inhibition of other metallopeptidases.", 
    "49": "The basic opioid peptide dynorphin was tested for histamine-releasing activity on peritoneal rat mast cells. Dynorphin was found to induce a dose-dependent histamine release from the mast cells. The threshold concentration was 2 X 10(-7) M and release was maximal (40% of total) at 2 X 10(-6) M of the peptide. The dynorphin-induced histamine release was a very rapid process completed within 10 seconds at 37 degrees C. The release was independent of extracellular calcium. Experiments with naloxone and a specific kappa-agonist (U-50,488H) gave results indicating that the dynorphin induced histamine release was probably not mediated through opioid kappa-receptors. A couple of other Arg-Pro containing peptides of different origin were also screened for histamine-releasing activity. Most of these peptides elicited a more or less pronounced histamine release, provided the peptide contained more than 5 amino acids, suggesting that the Arg-Pro sequence is of importance for the histamine-releasing effect of peptides such as dynorphin.", 
    "50": "In an attempt to assess the biochemical consequences resulting from structural differences between rat pulmonary and testicular angiotensin-converting enzyme, the thermal stability of crude and purified preparations of each enzyme was compared. Structural heterology was verified by molecular weight determinations and by peptide mapping after limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus V8 proteinase. Thermal stability was monitored by changes in catalytic activity following incubations at 55 degrees C in the presence of chelators and CoCl2. Purified pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme was more sensitive to inhibition by the chelators EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline and by the site-directed inhibitor captopril than was the testicular isozyme. Although the pulmonary holoenzyme was unaffected by cobalt, the testicular holoenzyme was inhibited by cobalt in a concentration-dependent manner. Crude pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme was significantly more resistant to thermal denaturation than its crude testicular counterpart. The differences in the thermal lability of each isozyme were still present in purified preparations, although the purified enzymes appeared to be more thermally stable than their crude counterparts. Both chelators and cobalt markedly potentiated the thermal denaturation of each isozyme. These data suggest that the structural heterology of the pulmonary and testicular isozymes may affect the interaction of zinc with the respective enzymes and that zinc may contribute to the structural integrity and thermal stability of angiotensin-converting enzyme in each tissue.", 
    "51": "To evaluate the cardiac effect of an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, the effect of intracoronary (i.c.) captopril on coronary blood flow and regional myocardial function was examined in the anesthetized open-chest dog. Blood flow of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX), left ventricular pressure (LVP), aortic pressure (AoP) and regional myocardial segment length were measured continuously. Captopril i.v. (0.3 mg/kg) produced an immediate reduction in AoP and an increase in percent shortening of myocardial segments followed by a decrease in coronary vascular resistance and increases in heart rate and LVdP/dt. Reductions in LCX flow induced by i.c. angiotensin were attenuated and i.c. bradykinin-induced increases in LCX flow were augmented after captopril. On the contrary, i.c. infusion of captopril (0.01 mg/min) into the LCX caused no change in hemodynamic variables and myocardial shortening although responses to angiotensin I and bradykinin were markedly modified. These results suggest that captopril may have no direct cardiac effect.", 
    "52": "The present study examined the regional vascular effects (radioactive microspheres) of converting-enzyme inhibition (captopril, 1 mg/kg) and calcium-antagonism (diltiazem, 1 mg/kg) in a rat model of cardiac failure due to large myocardial infarction (n = 18, infarct size 40% of the left ventricle) both at rest and during submaximal treadmill exercise. Diltiazem increased renal, gastrointestinal, coronary and cutaneous blood flow at rest by 29%, 28%, 26% and 37% (p less than 0.05 each) and enhanced skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise by 16% (p less than 0.05). Captopril improved primarily renal and coronary blood flow at rest (by 59% and 23%, respectively, p less than 0.05) and reduced vascular resistance in the gastrointestinal bed by 25% (p less than 0.05) without significant effects in other circulatory beds. We conclude that the regional vascular effects elicited by converting-enzyme inhibition and calcium antagonism differ considerably in this animal model of congestive heart failure and may be clinically important. The favourable regional vascular profile of diltiazem deserves further clinical investigation.", 
    "53": "Lisinopril (N alpha-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]L-lysyl-L-proline), a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is an exceptionally selective affinity chromatography ligand for this enzyme. Affinity chromatography furnishes electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme directly from crude homogenates of rabbit lung tissue, a 1,000-fold purification; also, it affords a 100,000-fold enrichment of the more rare human plasma enzyme in a single step. The affinity of angiotensin-converting enzyme for the Sepharose-spacer-lisinopril matrix (Ki matrix = 1 X 10(-5) M) is weak compared to its affinity for free lisinopril (Ki = 1 X 10(-10) M). The capacity of the affinity column is described quantitatively as a function of Ki matrix, lisinopril, and enzyme concentrations. The recovery of bound enzyme is low in chromatography of crude tissue samples (10-40%), although it approaches a reversible process (70-100%) with pure enzyme. The holoenzyme is converted to Zn2+-free apoenzyme to effect removal of lisinopril. In this process, the rate constant for spontaneous dissociation of Zn2+ from free enzyme is 1 X 10(-2) s-1 (t 1/2 = 1 min), which places a lower limit of 3 X 10(-10) M on the dissociation constant of Zn2+ at neutral pH from angiotensin-converting enzyme. The exceptional selectivity of lisinopril as an affinity chromatography ligand for angiotensin-converting enzyme suggests it is among the most specific inhibitors designed for any enzyme.", 
    "54": "Two novel peptide analogs, N alpha-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]L-alanyl-L-proline and the corresponding L-lysyl-L-proline derivative, have been demonstrated to be potent competitive inhibitors of purified rabbit lung angiotensin-converting enzyme: Ki = 2 and 1 X 10(-10) M, respectively, at pH 7.5, 25 degrees C, and 0.3 M chloride ion. Second-order rate constants for addition of these inhibitors to enzyme under the same conditions are in the range 1-2 X 10(6) M-1 s-1; first-order rate constants for dissociation of the EI complexes are in the range 1-4 X 10(-4) s-1. The association rate constants are similar to those measured for D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline, captopril, but the dissociation rate constants are severalfold slower and account for the higher affinity of these inhibitors for the enzyme. The dissociation constant for the EI complex containing N alpha-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]L-alanyl-L-proline is pH-dependent, and reaches a minimum at approximately pH 6: Ki = 4 +/- 1 X 10(-11) M. The pH dependence is consistent either with a model for which the protonation state of the secondary nitrogen atom in the inhibitor determines binding affinity, or one for which ionizations on the enzyme alone influence affinity for these inhibitors. The affinity of this inhibitor for the zinc-free apoenzyme is 2 X 10(4) times less than for the zinc-free apoenzyme is 2 X 10(4) times less than that for the holoenzyme. If considered as a \"collected product\" inhibitor, N alpha-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]L-alanyl-L-proline appears to derive an additional factor of 375 M in its affinity for the enzyme compared to that of the two products of its hypothetical hydrolysis, a consequence of favorable entropy effects.", 
    "55": "The degradation of the enkephalin-containing octapeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Gly-Leu (YGGFMRGL) was systematically investigated by incubating the peptide with synaptic membranes from rat striatum or with purified peptidases. The degradation products were derivatized with 4-dimethylamino-azobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate and then analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and by amino-terminal analysis. The incubation of YGGFMRGL with synaptic membranes yielded YGG, YGGF, YGGFM, and MR in a manner that was linear with respect to time. The corresponding carboxyl-terminal fragments FMRGL, MRGL, and RGL could not be detected, which suggests that the degradation of YGGFMRGL by synaptic membranes occurs by carboxypeptidase activity. The incubation of YGGFMRGL with different purified peptidases produced cleavage patterns unique from that seen with synaptic membranes. Enkephalinase recognized only the Gly-Phe bond to produce YGG and FMRGL. Thermolysin recognized the Gly-Phe bond and the Phe-Met bond to yield YGG, YGGF, FMRGL, and MRGL. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) produced primarily YGGF, MR, and lesser amounts of YGGFMR and YG. The formation of YGG, YGGF, and YGGFM by synaptic membranes could be stimulated 3-fold by the addition of 30 mM NaCl and inhibited by MK-422, an ACE inhibitor, with an IC50 of 3 nM. These data suggest that ACE, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, is the primary enzyme involved in the degradation of YGGFMRGL in brain. ACE apparently works in concert with another carboxypeptidase in brain to yield YGGFM and YGG since the carboxyl-terminal peptides RGL and FMRGL could not be detected.", 
    "56": "The thermoregulatory role of brain angiotensin II (ANG II) was tested by intracerebroventricular (IVT) infusion of ANG II or the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881 (SQ) in 15 conscious sheep. Deep body temperature decreased 0.30 +/- 0.07 degree C (SE) during the 3-h period of IVT ANG II (25 ng/min) infusion (P less than 0.05) and increased 0.50 +/- 0.13 degree C during IVT SQ (1 microgram/min) infusion (P less than 0.01). To determine whether the rise in body temperature after IVT SQ infusion might be the result of a central renin-angiotensin system (RAS), SQ was infused IVT in five conscious sheep 20 h after bilateral nephrectomy. This resulted in a significant rise in body temperature of 0.28 +/- 0.05 degree C (P less than 0.05). When vasopressin antidiuretic hormone (ADH) was infused intravenously at the same time of IVT SQ infusion, the rise in temperature was depressed, but ADH did not lower the temperature below basal. IVT dopamine (20 micrograms/min) increased body temperature by 0.40 +/- 0.04 degree C (P less than 0.01), which was qualitatively similar to the result with IVT SQ. These data support the hypothesis that endogenous brain ANG II may play a role in thermoregulation. Furthermore, plasma ADH level, regulated in part by brain ANG II, is probably not the mediator of that thermoregulation. The similar effects of IVT dopamine and SQ on body temperature strengthen the hypothesis that dopamine may be involved in the central action of brain ANG II.", 
    "57": "Indocyanine green estimated apparent liver blood flow was measured in normal volunteers following glyceryl trinitrate, propranolol, isosorbide mononitrate and captopril. Glyceryl trinitrate and propranolol significantly reduced apparent liver blood flow. Isosorbide mononitrate did not alter apparent liver blood flow or produce an additional reduction in apparent liver blood flow when combined with propranolol. Captopril did not alter apparent liver blood flow despite a significant fall in mean arterial pressure and rise in plasma renin activity. Captopril and isosorbide mononitrate if shown to reduce portal pressure, do so without a fall in apparent liver blood flow.", 
    "58": "The present experiments were undertaken to examine the involvement of prostaglandins and intrarenal beta-adrenergic system in captopril-induced renin release using conscious dogs. In a first series of experiments, plasma renin activity (PRA) increased 2.5- to 5.2-fold after captopril (1 mg/kg, i.v.) administration. When the same dose of captopril was given in indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.v.)-pretreated animals, PRA similarly increased. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were unchanged throughout the experiment in both non- and indomethacin-pretreated animals. In a second series of experiments, captopril-induced PRA elevation was observed under the condition of propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.)-pretreatment, although propranolol reduced base line PRA. Statistical analysis did not give a definite evidence that propranolol inhibits captopril-induced renin release. MAP and HR were not changed by captopril in propranolol-pretreated animals as well as in non-pretreated animals. These results suggest that prostaglandins and a real functional interaction with the beta-adrenergic system are not involved in the captopril-induced renin release in conscious dogs.", 
    "59": "This study examined interactions between adenosine (Ado) and angiotensin II (ANG II) in controlling renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In six normal dogs, intrarenal Ado infusion (1.0 mumol/min) transiently decreased RBF, but during sustained Ado infusion RBF increased to 122 +/- 7% of control, although GFR remained at 75 +/- 6% of control. Blockade of ANG II formation with the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 14225 (n = 6) almost abolished the transient decrease in RBF but did not prevent the sustained fall in GFR caused by Ado. When circulating ANG II was held constant by intravenous infusion of SQ 14225 and 20 ng . kg-1 . min-1 of ANG II (n = 6), Ado transiently decreased RBF but the return of RBF was much slower than in normal dogs and RBF did not increase above control. Maintenance of constant circulating ANG II did not prevent Ado-mediated decreases in GFR. These observations suggest that Ado-mediated reductions in GFR do not depend entirely on ANG II and may be due to dilation of efferent arterioles by Ado. However, the transient renal vasoconstriction caused by Ado depends on ANG II, and data from this study suggest that part of the waning constrictor response to Ado is due to suppression of renin secretion and endogenous ANG II formation. In circumstances where high ANG II levels are maintained (i.e., ischemic renal failure), Ado may be capable of causing sustained renal vasoconstriction.", 
    "60": "The efficacy of captopril treatment was compared with that of propranolol in a single-blind crossover study in 14 patients with essential hypertension uncontrolled on diuretic alone. Both captopril (37.5 to 75 mg daily) and propranolol (60 to 120 mg daily), in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily), caused a significant fall in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Heart rate, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone data were consistent with the effects of converting enzyme inhibition or beta blockade. Both drugs were well tolerated. Captopril appeared to be equivalent in efficacy and safety to propranolol when added to hydrochlorothiazide. It may be considered as an alternative step 2 antihypertensive agent, especially in patients experiencing unwanted effects on beta blockers.", 
    "61": "The effects of enalapril (10-20 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25-50 mg twice daily), and combination enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide therapy (10-20 mg enalapril/25-50 mg hydrochlorothiazide in combination tablet twice daily) were evaluated and compared to no therapy (control) in eight patients with mild to moderate hypertension at rest and during treadmill exercise. All active treatments reduced standing blood pressure in patients at rest compared to the control group (p less than 0.05); however, none produced significant reductions of standing blood pressure in patients at peak exercise. Standing heart rates of patients at rest and at peak exercise were not changed with active therapy. However, standing heart rate in patients at rest was lower with enalapril than with hydrochlorothiazide and combination therapy (p less than 0.05). Heart rate of patients on hydrochlorothiazide was higher than with control and other therapies at Stage I of exercise (p less than 0.01). Supine norepinephrine levels in patients at rest were elevated with both hydrochlorothiazide and combination therapy when compared to that in patients with enalapril and control (p less than 0.05). Treatment with enalapril alone produced no changes in plasma catecholamine levels compared to control. There were no differences between control and all treatment regimens in peak exercise levels of catecholamines. Thus, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and combination therapy, although effective in lowering resting blood pressure, may not be effective in blunting the blood-pressure response to exercise. The drugs do not appear to have any significant effects on catecholamine levels in patients at peak exercise.", 
    "62": "To further clarify the role of the renal kallikrein-kinin system in essential hypertension, a sensitive and simple method for the determination of both human urinary kininase I and kininase II was established, and the system components were determined in patients. In the measurement of kininase activity, desalted urine samples were incubated with synthetic bradykinin, and the reaction was terminated with kininase inhibitors, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and phenanthroline. Thus, kininase activity was determined as the kinin-destroying capacity. Moreover, the specific inhibitor for kininase II, SQ14225, was applied for the separation of kininase I and kininase II activities. Daily urinary excretions of total kininase and kininase I activities were significantly higher in essential hypertensive patients than those in normotensive subjects, whereas no difference was observed in kininase II activity. As reported previously, daily excretions of urinary kallikrein and kinin simultaneously determined in these patients were significantly lower than excretions in normotensive subjects. From these results, it was suggested that not only decreased renal kallikrein, but also increased kininase activity, may play an important role in the suppression of the renal kallikrein-kinin system through the reduction of active kinin level in essential hypertension.",

    "64": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension was examined in five conscious sheep. Captopril infusion alone (15 mg/kg per day) for 2 days produced a small fall in blood pressure. After 2 days of captopril ACTH was infused (20 micrograms/kg per day) for 3 days together with captopril. The blood pressure and electrolyte effects of ACTH administration were not modified by captopril pretreatment. These experiments establish that angiotensin II is not important in the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension in sheep.", 
    "65": "A continuous monitoring spectrophotometric method for the measurement of angiotensin-converting enzyme in human serum is described. It is based on the hydrolysis of furylacrylylphenylalanylglycylglycine and applied to an IL Multistat III centrifugal analyser. The method offers better precision and freedom from interference than a fluorimetric assay we have previously described.", 
    "66": "The converting enzyme inhibitor HOE 498 was evaluated in 12 normotensive male volunteers aged 21 to 26. The efficacy of single 5, 10 or 20 mg oral doses in blocking the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I was tested in 3 of the subjects. All 3 doses of HOE 498 reduced the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I to below 50% of control within 1,5 h following administration of the drug. Plasma renin and converting enzyme activity, blood angiotensin I, as well as plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone were measured serially before and up to 72 h following oral administration of a single dose of 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg of HOE 498 to groups of 5 volunteers each. As expected, blood angiotensin I levels and plasma renin activity rose while plasma converting enzyme activity, plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentration fell after administration of the drug. While the dose of 2.5 mg did not reduce plasma converting enzyme activity below 20% of control, the higher doses all resulted in plasma converting enzyme inhibition exceeding 90%. No side-effects were observed. It is concluded that in normal volunteers HOE 498 is an effective potent and long-acting converting enzyme inhibitor. Based on these preliminary findings it is expected that 5 mg HOE 948 will turn out to be adequate for therapeutic use.", 
    "67": "Withdrawal of captopril therapy for cardiac failure results in increments in plasma cortisol, noradrenaline and heart rate. To determine whether these changes related to the concomitant rise in circulating angiotensin II, we infused angiotensin II at 0.5, 2, 4 and 8 ng/kg/minute, each infusion lasting for 1 hour, in 4 patients during maintenance captopril therapy for heart failure. A control solution of 5% dextrose was infused over a similar time interval on a separate day. The study was performed under metabolic balance conditions, with constant body posture and continuous haemodynamic monitoring. Angiotensin II induced the expected rise in arterial pressure and in plasma aldosterone. In contrast the diurnal decline in plasma ACTH and cortisol was not altered, and no changes in noradrenaline or heart rate were observed. Plasma angiotensin II appears to have little or no effect on ACTH, cortisol, noradrenaline and heart rate under the conditions of this study.", 
    "68": "A series of tetrahedral oxo acids of Group VA and VIA elements and of silicon and boron were examined as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Arsenate is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 27 +/- 1 mM, at least 10-fold more potent than phosphate. Dimethylarsinate is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 70 +/- 9 mM, 2-fold more potent than dimethylphosphinate. Oxo acids of boron, silicon, antimony, sulphur and selenium are not inhibitors. On the basis of these results and the strong inhibition of this zinc metallopeptidase by substrate analogues containing a tetrahedral phosphorus atom, two substrate analogues containing a tetrahedral arsenic atom were prepared. 2-Arsonoacetyl-L-proline is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 18 +/- 7 mM, more than 2000-fold weaker than that of its phosphorus analogue 2-phosphonoacetyl-L-proline. 4-Arsono-2-benzylbutanoic acid is a mixed inhibitor with a Ki of 0.5 +/- 0.2 mM, indistinguishable in potency from its phosphorus analogue 2-benzyl-4-phosphonobutanoic acid.", 
    "69": "Twenty patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension were randomized in a paralleled, double-blind, 22-week study of captopril (ten) and enalapril (ten) following four weeks of hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/d) baseline treatment. The captopril group was administered 25 mg tid and increased to 100 mg tid, while the enalapril group began with 5 mg bid and increased to 20 mg bid, depending on the patient's blood pressure (BP) response. Methyldopa, 250 mg to 500 mg bid and 1,000 mg bid, was administered to patients in both groups if BP was not adequately controlled. Patients were seen every two weeks for BP monitoring and metabolic evaluation. Each group showed a significant and equal decrease in BP, with the effect being the greatest on the diastolic pressure, supine and upright. Of the 20 patients, ten (four whites and six blacks) required methyldopa for adequate BP control. Four patients, two from each group, developed reversible prerenal azotemia (BUN [blood urea nitrogen] congruent to 50 mg/dL). No other clinical or metabolic side effects were noted. We concluded that captopril and enalapril were equally effective in lowering BP in the dosages given; no racial differences in BP response were noted, although more black patients required the addition of methyldopa for adequate BP control; and both drugs were safe and well tolerated.", 
    "70": "The effect of converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) on the renal response to atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was determined in the rat. In the absence of CEI, ANF produced rapid and significant increases in sodium, potassium, calcium, and urine excretions while blood pressure declined transiently. In the presence of CEI, ANF enhanced the excretion of sodium and potassium but not of calcium and urine. The activity of CEI was documented by observing that, in the presence of CEI, the elevation of blood pressure produced by angiotensin I was significantly attenuated. The potentiating effect of CEI on the natriuretic response to ANF supports the hypothesis that converting enzyme may be involved in the metabolism of ANF.",

Both the purified preparation PE-E and highly purified preparation PE-A split teprotide at the bonds Pro3-Arg4 and Pro5-Gln6. The Pro8-Pro9-OH bond was not split by the two enzymes. The comparative characteristics of the properties of PE-E and PE-A are presented and the possible physiological role of these enzymes is discussed.", 
    "72": "Ten healthy subjects received 10 mg oral enalapril (MK 421) daily for a period of 8 days. Renal clearances of electrolytes, urate and phosphate were monitored and factored for glomerular filtration rate, as measured by creatinine clearance, with particular emphasis on the first and eighth day of treatment. Apart from a fall of around 10% in creatinine clearance between 1-2 h on both days 1 and 8, GFR remained unchanged throughout the study. Fractional sodium excretion increased in a biphasic manner by approximately 50% over control between 1-2 h and 4-8 h on day 1. Significant chloruresis (+39.0 +/- 12.9%) and kaluresis (+26.5 +/- 10.3%) occurred between 4-8 h. Urinary pH increased between 0-1 h (+0.29 +/- 0.12; P less than 0.05), and between 4-8 h (+0.50 +/- 0.08; P less than 0.01). The biphasic saluretic effect was also seen between 1-2 h and 4-8 h on day 8. Enalapril caused significant increases in urate and phosphate excretion on day 8 of therapy. There was a biphasic increase in fractional urate excretion at 1-2 h (+28.1 +/- 6.9%; P less than 0.05) and at 4-8 h (+21.0 +/- 6.0% P less than 0.01). Significant phosphaturia (+36.8 +/- 5.2%; P less than 0.05) was also observed at 4-8 h on day 8. Urinary drug excretion was also biphasic; over the first 2 h the predominant drug form was unchanged enalapril, whilst the peak excretion of the diacid metabolite, enalaprilat, occurred at 4-8 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was measured in isolated peripheral blood monocytes and culture medium from 28 patients with sarcoidosis and compared with values obtained from monocytes of 25 normal control subjects. ACE activity was determined by radioimmunoassay of angiotensin II produced from angiotensin I. While there was no measurable ACE activity in monocytes or culture medium from normal controls under the conditions of our study, monocytes from patients with sarcoidosis all showed activity both in cells and culture medium. The mean ACE activity of monocytes from patients with sarcoidosis was 2.0 pg angiotensin II formed/min per 10(5) cells, and that released into medium over a 24-h interval was 30.4 pg angiotensin II/min per 10(5) cells. The monocyte ACE from patients with sarcoidosis was activated by chloride ions and inhibited by EDTA, captopril, and rabbit antiserum to purified human plasma ACE, indicating that enzymatic activity was effected specifically by ACE. Thus, our studies show a significant elevation and release of ACE by peripheral blood monocytes of patients with sarcoidosis under conditions where monocytes of normal control subjects do not demonstrate ACE activity.", 
    "74": "19-Nor-deoxycorticosterone (19-nor-DOC) is a human mineralocorticoid. The regulation of its secretion is poorly understood, as renin angiotensin II (ANG II) stimulation has minimal effects on 19-nor-DOC. This study sought to determine if ANG II inhibition would decrease 19-nor-DOC production. Six normal subjects on fixed electrolyte intake were admitted to a metabolic unit. After a 5-day control period to establish electrolyte balance, enalapril, p.o., 10 mg/day, was administered for 28 days. This treatment resulted in ANG II inhibition, which was reflected by a rise in plasma renin activity, a blunting of the postural plasma aldosterone increment, and a decrease in aldosterone secretion rate (ASR). Levels of urinary free (UF) 19-nor-DOC progressively decreased from 294 +/- 108 ng/day on Day 0 to 164 +/- 70 on Day 3, 141 +/- 62 on Day 7, 101 +/- 38 on Day 14, 68 +/- 18 on Day 21, and 106 +/- 31 on Day 28. The decrease in 19-nor-DOC levels was synchronous with the fall in ASR (R = 0.94, n = 5, p less than 0.005), but it was of greater magnitude (71% decrease in 19-nor-DOC levels versus 41% decrease in ASR). In addition, the decrease in 19-nor-DOC levels correlated with a fall in urinary potassium and an increase in both urinary sodium and chloride (R = 0.68, -0.79, -0.87 respectively; n = 6, p less than 0.05). The fall in ASR, on the other hand, was not significantly correlated with the changes in these urinary electrolyte levels (R = 0.65, 0.64, 0.57 respectively; n = 5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "The discovery of captopril as a potent, orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) led to the recent development of many series of novel structures with similar biological activity. To date, however, all of these inhibitors are flexible or semiflexible molecules, and there is therefore no clear definition of the conformational requirements for ACE inhibition. In an effort to solve this problem, we have carried out conformational energy calculations on a series of eight structurally diverse ACE inhibitors. Comparison of the low-energy conformations available to these molecules leads to the conclusion that there is a common low-energy conformation throughout the series. The calculations thus define the structural and conformational requirements for ACE inhibition. Expansion of this model to the receptor level has been achieved by considering possible alternative receptor sites for each of the molecules in its proposed biologically active conformation and leads to an active-site model for ACE which may be useful for the design of further inhibitors.", 
    "76": "A series of (mercaptoaroyl)amino acids and related compounds was synthesized and tested for ability to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The most active compound was N-(3-chloro-2-mercaptobenzoyl)-N-cyclopentylglycine, having an in vitro I50 = 0.28 microM. Substitution of the aromatic 3-position by small polar groups enhanced ACE inhibitory activity, whereas bulky groups diminished it. Alteration of the beta relationship between the mercaptan and amide carbonyl or masking of the thiol by acylation reduced activity. Replacement of the thiol by nitro, hydroxy, or carboxy gave compounds lacking ACE inhibitory activity.", 
    "77": "Metabolism of enkephalins during transit through the pulmonary circulation may be of significance in regulating systemic levels of these opioids. To determine whether Leu- and Met-enkephalin are metabolized by the pulmonary circulation, [3H]Tyr-Leu-enkephalin (10 microM) or [3H]Tyr-Met-enkephalin (10 microM) were each administered to isolated rat lungs perfused in a recirculating manner with a physiologic salt solution and a recently developed high-performance liquid radiochromatographic analytical method was used to identify and quantitate metabolites in the perfusion medium. Both Leu- and Met-enkephalin were metabolized in a curvilinear, time-dependent manner. The principal metabolites were identified as tyrosine and Tyr-Gly-Gly. Neither Tyr-Gly nor Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe were detected in significant amounts. After a 20-min perfusion, residual Leu- or Met-enkephalin accounted for 28.4 and 21.5%, respectively, of the radioactivity present in the perfusate. In addition, 97% of the initial radioactivity for both Leu- and Met-enkephalin were found in the perfusion medium, indicating that neither the parent compounds nor metabolites were avidly sequestered in pulmonary tissue. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (18 microM) blocked the formation of Tyr-Gly-Gly and attenuated slightly the production of tyrosine. Inhibition of aminopeptidase with bestatin (116 microM) blocked the formation of tyrosine and enhanced production of Tyr-Gly-Gly. Inhibition of enkephalinase with thiorphan (0.3 microM) did not appear to affect Met-enkephalin metabolism. These observations indicate that in isolated, buffer perfused rat lungs Leu- and Met-enkephalin are metabolized during pulmonary transit by at least two enzymes, angiotensin converting enzyme and aminopeptidase.", 
    "78": "Presynaptic angiotensin II (AII) receptor-mediated facilitation of vascular adrenergic neurotransmission was studied in the in situ, blood-perfused mesentery of 13- to 16-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Mesenteric arterial perfusion pressure frequency-response curves to periarterial adrenergic nerve stimulation (PNS) and dose-response curves to exogenous norepinephrine (NE) were obtained in SHR and WKY. The effects of the following treatments on the mesenteric vascular perfusion pressure responses (PPR) to PNS and NE were studied: All alone infused i.a. at 1 and 5 ng/min; All infused at 5 ng/min after [Sar1-lle8]All infused at 20 ng/min; [Sar1-lle8]All infused at 20 ng/min alone; captopril alone at 0.1 mg/kg i.v.; All infused i.a. at 0.3 and 1 ng/min after captopril at 0.1 mg/kg and angiotensin I injected at 3 dose levels after captopril at 0.1 mg/kg. Control PPR to PNS and NE were greater in SHR than in WKY. Comparisons of PPR in SHR to those in WKY were made, therefore, at the predetermined PPR levels of 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 mm Hg. All alone shifted the PNS frequency-response curve to the left to a greater extent in the SHR than in the WKY when infused at 5 ng/min but not when infused at 1 ng/min. Both infusion rates of All had significantly different effects on the dose-response curves to NE in WKY and SHR. The effects of All infusion (5 ng/min) on both the response to PNS and to NE were antagonized completely by the concurrent infusion of [Sar1-lle8] All at 20 ng/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "Isolated perfused rabbit lungs were used to study the hydrolysis of [3H]benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline [( 3H]BPAP), a synthetic substrate for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Lungs were perfused, at constant flow rates, with physiologic medium containing added BPAP and the concentration of its metabolite, [3H]benzoyl-phenylalaline, was measured in lung effluent. Hydrolysis of BPAP (4.2 microM) was 64.1 +/- 3.3% at 37 degrees C and was significantly decreased (P less than .01) to 10.1 +/- 8.7% by the addition of the ACE inhibitor, MK422 (10(-6) M). Disappearance (i.e., hydrolysis) of immunoreactive angiotensin I was also inhibited by MK422. Hydrolysis of BPAP was saturable and calculated apparent kinetic constants were Km = 13 microM and Vmax = 50 nmol/sec/lung. When the perfusion medium temperature was 10 degrees C, apparent Km was unchanged, whereas Vmax was significantly (P less than .05) decreased. At BPAP concentrations sufficient to depress metabolism to less than 20%, perfusion pressure was unchanged. Hydrolysis of BPAP under first-order conditions was independent of flow over the range 10 to 50 ml/min. However, increase in flow rate to 100 ml/min/lung was associated with decreased BPAP metabolism. These data indicate that BPAP is a substrate for pulmonary ACE in vitro and substantiate its use in intact animals because: 1) it is without physiologic effect in high doses; and 2) calculated apparent kinetics in isolated lungs under these conditions of steady-state concentrations were similar to those obtained from earlier studies that utilized bolus injection techniques in intact animals.", 
    "80": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed which enables sensitive determination of captopril and its mixed disulphides in plasma and urine after oral administration of a new antihypertensive agent, 1-(D-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl)-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine (DU-1219, I). Captopril is derivatized with a new reagent, N-(4-benzoylphenyl)maleimide and the derivative is extracted with chloroform and assayed using a liquid chromatograph equipped with an ultraviolet detector at 254 nm. Mixed disulphides of captopril with thiol compounds such as cysteine, glutathione and plasma proteins are reduced with tributylphosphine to form captopril, followed by derivatization with N-(4-benzoylphenyl)maleimide. Accurate determinations are possible over a concentration range of 10-500 ng/ml captopril in plasma, and 100-2500 ng/ml captopril in urine. The coefficients of variation of captopril in plasma (200 ng/ml) and urine (500 ng/ml) are 3.7% and 2.6%, respectively, and those of mixed disulphides of captopril are similar to those of captopril. Plasma levels and urinary excretion of captopril and its mixed disulphides in healthy volunteers following single oral administration of I (50 mg) have also been determined.", 
    "81": "[1-Sarcosine, 7-Alanine] angiotensin I [( 1-Sar, 7-Ala] AI) and closely related analogs were tested for inotropic activity in the isolated cat heart, and for pressor activity in the intact conscious sheep both before and during converting enzyme inhibition (CEI). [1-Sar, 7-Ala] AI exhibited potent inotropic activity but was only weakly pressor. [1-Sar] AI, [1-Sar, 5-Val] AI, [1-Sar, 7-alpha MeAla] AI [1-Sar, 5-Val, 7-NMeAla] AI and [1-Sar, 5-Val, 7-Sar] were all potent agonists in both preparations. The action of [1-Sar, 7-Ala] AI was potentiated by CEI in both the isolated heart and the intact sheep. The activity of the remaining analogs was either partially or completely blocked by CEI. The activity of all analogs was inhibited by AII receptor blockade. These data indicate that the nature of the substitution in position 7 determines the affinity of the analog for converting enzyme. The [7-Ala] substitution appears to decrease the effect of the analog upon vascular receptors.",

Fifteen out-patients receiving oral hypoglycaemic drugs or insulin and suffering from slight or moderate hypertension (diastolic AP: 95-115 mmHg) were selected for treatment. The Captopril was administered in daily doses of 50 or 100 mg for 60 days. Tests on the 30th and 60th days revealed a statistically significant reduction in max/min OAP values, but no statistically significant variations in either cardiac frequency or glycaemia before and after meals.

    "83": "H.261, a new transition state inhibitor of human renin with an IC50 of 6.9 X 10(-10) M, was given by intravenous infusion to six anaesthetized baboons. The inhibitor was infused first at 0.1 mumol/kg/h for 15 min, then at 1.0 mumol/kg/h for a further 15 min. After a recovery period of 2 h in which the animals received 5% dextrose, they were infused with captopril, 25 mumol/kg/h for 15 min. At both rates of infusion H.261 markedly and significantly reduced the enzymatic action of renin in plasma, the blood concentration of angiotensin I, the plasma concentration of angiotensin II and mean arterial pressure. All changes reverted towards or to control values in the subsequent control period. Captopril also lowered plasma angiotensin II concentration and mean arterial pressure markedly and significantly but, as expected for an inhibitor of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme, plasma active renin concentration and blood angiotensin I concentration increased. The changes of angiotensin II and arterial pressure were similar with captopril and H.261.", 
    "84": "Systemic administration of angiotensin II (ANG II) (200 micrograms/kg sc) to the rat induced a hypothermic response that was characterized within 12 min by a reduction in the rate of O2 consumption, vasodilation of the tail, and a 1.3 degrees C fall in colonic temperature. Administration of ANG II in doses ranging from 10 to 200 micrograms/kg resulted in a decrease in colonic and an increase in tail skin temperature. Angiotensin I (ANG I) (200 micrograms/kg sc) induced a similar hypothermic response which was abolished by pretreatment with the ANG I-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (35 mg/kg ip). The interaction of ANG II with cholinergic and adrenergic pathways was evaluated to determine possible mechanisms. Treatment with ANG II (200 micrograms/kg sc) and propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (6 mg/kg ip), resulted in a greater depression of colonic temperature (Tco) than was observed with ANG II alone but did not affect the increase in tail skin temperature (Tsk) accompanying administration of ANG II. When ANG II was administered in combination with the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (50 micrograms/kg ip), Tco remained at control levels, whereas an enhancement of the ANG II-induced increase in Tsk occurred. Administration of ANG II in combination with atropine sulfate (6 mg/kg ip), a muscarinic receptor antagonist which crosses the blood-brain barrier, significantly reduced the extent of the fall in Tco without affecting the increase in Tsk. The combined treatment of ANG II and the quaternary analogue, atropine methyl nitrate (3.25 mg/kg ip), which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, failed to affect the hypothermic responses to ANG II. These results suggest that the hypothermic responses to ANG II may be mediated through a central cholinergic pathway and possibly influenced by an adrenergic component. The inability of both adrenergic and cholinergic blockers to affect the vasodilatory response of the tail of the rat to administration of ANG II suggests that the mechanisms subserving heat production can be blocked independently of those subserving heat loss.", 
    "85": "Captopril (CP) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor whose metabolism involves endogenous thiols which may be depleted at high doses of CP. Following intraperitoneal administration of CP (50-300 mg/kg), dose-dependent depletion of hepatic glutathione, increased serum transaminase (SGPT) levels and hepatic necrosis were observed. The hepatic necrosis observed was either subcapsular or parenchymal in distribution. Both types of necrosis showed a dose-dependent increase in severity but with a large inter-animal variation. The patterns of necrosis observed with CP are different from the necrosis caused by paracetamol. Oral CP (300 mg/kg) caused parenchymal necrosis in only one animal. It is suggested that subcapsular necrosis may be due to the direct effect of i.p. captopril whereas parenchymal necrosis may be a consequence of hepatic GSH depletion.", 
    "86": "High rates of drinking in seawater-adapted, compared with freshwater (FW)-adapted, flounder were associated with raised plasma chloride and osmotic concentrations. Hypotension in FW-adapted fish, after papaverine administration, gave rise to greatly elevated rates of drinking. This dipsogenic response apparently relied on activation of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and was abolished by simultaneous administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Exogenous angiotensin II was shown to be dipsogenic and vasopressor in the FW-adapted fish. The physiological importance of the activation of the RAS in the control of drinking behavior in euryhaline fish is discussed.", 
    "87": "Many vasodilators have been tried as antianginal agents, but the reflex increase in sympathetic tone produced by these drugs necessitate their use with caution in patients with angina. In the first part of this study, captopril was given to 14 patients with angina and systolic arterial pressures of greater than 120 mm Hg. Over the short term, captopril decreased arterial blood pressure (from 110 +/- 18 to 98 +/- 18 mm Hg, p less than .01) without increasing heart rate (75 +/- 15 vs 74 +/- 15 beats/min), arterial concentrations of epinephrine (0.38 +/- 0.28 vs 0.34 +/- 0.25 nM) or norepinephrine (2.7 +/- 2.1 vs 2.8 +/- 2.1 nM), or transmyocardial norepinephrine balance (216 +/- 254 vs 146 +/- 170 p mol/min). Captopril decreased average myocardial oxygen consumption (9.7 +/- 4.1 to 8.2 +/- 2.7 ml/min, p less than .01). Given over the long term (mean 5.5 months), captopril decreased the severity of angina from NYHA classification 3.0 +/- 0.8 to 1.6 +/- 0.8. In the second part of this study, captopril was given in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 21 patients with stable exercise-induced angina and systolic arterial pressures greater than 120 mm Hg. Captopril increased exercise time (309 +/- 137 vs 374 +/- 142 sec, p less than .05) without changing anginal threshold (rate-pressure product 17.0 +/- 6.0 vs 17.1 +/- 5.6 X 10(-3)). We conclude that captopril decreases mean arterial pressure without causing a reflex increase in myocardial sympathetic tone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "A patient with unilateral ureteral obstruction by urolithiasis at the ureteropelvic junction was accompanied by hypertension. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was high in peripheral veins and was significantly higher in the renal vein drained from the affected kidney than the contralateral. Infusion of angiotensin II antagonist or an oral administration of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, resulted in a prompt drop of blood pressure. After pyelolithotomy was successfully performed, both the blood pressure and peripheral PRA completely normalized. It is suggested that the renin-angiotensin system might have played a major role in the mechanism of the accompanied hypertension. Hyperreninemia could have been caused by both renal ischemic vasoconstriction, which might be due to uretero-renal reflex, and increased synthesis of prostaglandins resulting from ureteropelvic obstruction.", 
    "89": "To assess whether and how the activation of the renin-angiotensin system that occurs in response to changes in posture contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure, we measured blood pressure, heart rate, plasma noradrenaline and plasma active and inactive renin in patients with essential hypertension in the supine, sitting and standing positions, (each sustained for 30 min), before and after administration of captopril. These studies were performed before and after a brief period of diuretic therapy. Both in the normal and in the sodium depleted state captopril reduced the normal adaptive response of blood pressure to changes in body position, whereas the responses of heart rate and plasma noradrenaline to these stimuli were unaffected by captopril. In contrast, the postural increases in active renin were magnified after captopril while inactive renin was unchanged throughout these acute studies. Our results indicate that during mild but rather prolonged postural stresses the generation of angiotensin by active renin supports blood pressure either through its direct vasoconstrictive effect and/or by potentiating the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. It is unlikely that the changes in active renin depend upon conversion from the inactive form.", 
    "90": "The effects of enalapril maleate and its lysine analogue, lisinopril, on reflex control of heart rate after acute and chronic administration were examined in 10 normotensive males. Both drugs reduced blood pressure without change in heart rate after acute dosing and after seven days. Both drugs impaired the vagally mediated early cardiac acceleration associated with lying down (standing to lying test). A similar effect was observed following edrophonium. After lisinopril bradycardia induced by facial immersion (diving reflex) was significantly attenuated. Edrophonium similarly attenuated the bradycardia. Both these reflexes are parasympathetically mediated. Neither drug altered heart rate or blood pressure changes following Valsalva's manoeuvre and the cold pressor test. Plasma noradrenaline was unchanged. Absence of reflex tachycardia with blood pressure reduction by converting enzyme inhibitors may be related to increased parasympathetic activity either centrally or peripherally without impairment of baroreflexes or sympathetic function.", 
    "91": "The effects of enalapril maleate (MK-421), a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were studied on 5 patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) due to unilateral renal artery stenosis. The therapeutic dosage was increased when the blood pressure (BP) was not controlled for more than 3 days. Blood sampling was performed before, and 5 hr and 24 hr after the first administration, and on the 3rd day with each dosage. The BP was normalized on 5 mg/day in 1 case, 10 mg in 1 case, 20 mg in 2 cases, and 40 mg plus mefruside in 1 case. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was significantly increased after 5 hr and recovered after 24 hr with 2.5 mg of the enalapril maleate, when the BP was not affected. This indicates that the increase in PRA is likely due to the reduced negative feedback of angiotensin II. When the blood pressure was lowered, PRA was increased and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was decreased significantly. This rise of PRA may depend not only on the reduced negative feedback but also on the fall of BP. It is also considered that the PAC was decreased through the decrease in plasma angiotensin II. A fall of the glomerular filtration rate in one case and also a fall of the perfusion of the kidney of the stenotic side in another case were observed by radioisotope renograms. MK-421 administration was a useful treatment for RVH, and clearly normalized the BP of all the patients studied. However, there was a risk of a fall of renal function on the stenotic side due to the decrease in perfusion pressure.", 
    "92": "The aims of this study were to investigate the potential effects of captopril (CPT)-induced chronic hyperreninemia on atherogenesis, and to describe and quantitate the morphological changes which occur in the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus of drug-treated rabbits. Four groups of normotensive New Zealand rabbits were used. Drug control groups were fed regular rabbit chow (Group I), or regular chow supplemented with cholesterol (Group III). Group II animals were fed regular chow and treated with captopril, and Group IV animals were fed the cholesterol-diet and treated with captopril. Daily captopril administration for a period of six months resulted in significantly (p less than 0.001) increased levels of plasma renin activity and blood urea nitrogen. Mean systemic arterial pressure, plasma aldosterone levels, and hematocrits were significantly reduced in the CPT-treated animals as compared to untreated control groups. No effect on atherogenesis was found. Morphometric analysis showed no difference in the size of the glomeruli between the untreated and the CPT-treated, normal-diet groups, however, significant (p less than 0.001) hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the JG complex were observed in all CPT-treated animals. It is concluded that captopril-induced reductions in systemic arterial blood pressure and perfusion pressure, in concert with a blocked renin-angiotensin system which interferes with the normal autoregulation of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, leads to significant morphologic and functional alterations in the kidney of normotensive animals.", 
    "93": "Plasma angiotensin I and II (AI and AII) were measured in 13 patients with essential hypertension before and during chronic treatment with enalapril (MK 421) and in seven subjects during an acute study. Two techniques were used for simultaneous extraction of AI and AII. Despite appropriate correction for cross-reaction of AI with the AII antibody, one of the techniques gave consistently higher AII and lower AI levels in plasma of subjects treated with enalapril. The possibility of in vitro conversion of AI into AII-immunoreactive material during the purification or the radioimmunoassay steps should be considered. The use of the alternative technique is proposed for simultaneous processing of blood samples for AI and AII.", 
    "94": "Enalaprilic acid (MK-422), the biologically active diacid of the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, was studied in myocardial ischemia (MI). Acute left coronary artery ligation was produced in 62 male Sprague-Dawley rats, and infarct size was determined by left ventricular free wall (LVFW) creatine kinase (CK) activity. Administration of enalaprilic acid (2 mg/kg) 2 minutes and 24 hours after MI significantly blunted the reduction in LVFW CK activity at 48 hours after ligation, when compared to the MI rats given vehicle (6.4 +/- 0.5 vs 4.7 +/- 0.2 IU/mg protein, respectively; p less than 0.01). The percentage of LVFW spared was significantly (p less than 0.01) increased from 28 +/- 2% to 45 +/- 5% by MK-422. MK-422 also significantly blunted the loss of LVFW CK activity 48 hours after a coronary ligation (10 minutes) followed by reperfusion, when compared to vehicle (10.1 +/- 0.6 vs 8.3 +/- 0.6 IU/mg protein, respectively; p less than 0.05). This represents a significant increase in the percentage of LVFW spared, 65 +/- 5% vs 85 +/- 6% (p less than 0.05). These data indicate a significant protective action afforded by MK-422 in two different protocols of ischemic damage to the myocardium and suggest a role for the renin-angiotensin system in the extension of ischemic damage.", 
    "95": "[3H]-Dynorphin A (1-8) was degraded in brain homogenates at 25 degrees and even at 0 degree C. The peptidase inhibitors bestatin and captopril almost completely protected[3H]-dynorphin A (1-8) from degradation at 0 degree C but had only little effect on binding at this temperature. At 25 degrees C, the binding of [3H]-dynorphin A (1-8) was markedly improved by addition of bestatin, captopril and L-leucyl-L-arginine, which afforded some, but not complete protection from degradation. The results of saturation binding assays at 25 degrees C in the presence of the peptidase inhibitors were variable. However, it was found from saturation binding assays at 0 degree C that the maximum binding capacity for [3H]-dynorphin A (1-8) at the kappa-site is similar to that of [3H]-(-)-bremazocine and [3H]-dynorphin A (1-9).", 
    "96": "The present studies involved oral administration of captopril alone or in combination with individual diuretics in conscious, freely-moving spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Both blood pressure (BP) and urinary fluid and electrolyte excretion were concomitantly measured. Captopril, 10 mg kg-1, caused a decrease in BP (-18 +/- 3 mm Hg) which was not significantly different from control (-10 +/- 2 mm Hg). Diuretics alone also failed to alter BP. However the BP-lowering effect of captopril was readily potentiated by concomitant administration of a single oral dose of frusemide (10 and 30 mg kg-1) in proportion to the magnitude of urinary loss. Hydrochlorothiazide at 1 and 3 mg kg-1 oral and metolazone at 0.3 and 1 mg kg-1 oral induced fluid loss similar to frusemide at 10 mg kg-1 and all produced comparable BP reduction in combination with captopril (25-32 mm Hg). Triamterene did not increase fluid excretion and was ineffective. In SHR with bilateral ureteral ligation, the synergistic effect of frusemide was abolished while that of hydrochlorothiazide still occurred with a delayed onset. It is concluded that concomitant measurement of BP and urinary excretion in conscious, freely-moving SHR is a useful technique for studying new antihypertensive drugs. Using this preparation it was found that enhancement of the acute hypotensive response to captopril with concomitant diuretic therapy occurs within 10 min and is primarily related to the fluid and Na loss, regardless of the diuretic agent used.",

The resulting modified tripeptides (i.e. 4) are shown to be a new class of potent inhibitors of converting enzyme.", 
    "98": "Positive inotropic agents can stimulate the severely depressed myocardium in late stages of heart failure. However, symptomatic benefits are only gained by improvement in the deranged peripheral circulation, which produces symptoms and limitations. In augmenting cardiac output and reducing filling pressures, the effects of positive inotropic agents and vasodilators are similar and additive, and the \"contractile reserve of the heart\" in response to inotropic stimulation may limit efficacy of these agents. Although symptomatic benefits occur in patients with severe heart failure after improvement in peripheral blood flow distribution, survival may not be altered, because this appears to be determined more by the amount of myocardial damage and its progression, and neither of these is affected by either inotropic agents or vasodilators. Indeed, in early stages of heart failure, therapy must be redirected toward preventing further myocardial cell loss rather than stimulating pump function.", 
    "99": "The renin-angiotension system is activated in many patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), resulting in angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction and aldosterone-mediated sodium and water retention. To evaluate the effectiveness of enalapril, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril was administered to patients either orally or intravenously in a single dose, and hemodynamic and hormonal responses were measured. Patients were then placed on oral enalapril therapy for 1 month, and treadmill exercise duration and invasive hemodynamics were compared with baseline pretreatment data. With single-dose administration, both oral and intravenous enalapril reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac output. However, the effects of oral enalapril were not manifest for 3 to 4 hours, because oral enalapril is a pro-drug form that requires hepatic deesterification. In contrast, intravenous enalapril resulted in significant hemodynamic and hormonal changes 15 to 30 minutes after administration. During long-term therapy, enalapril was associated with improved symptomatology, increase of treadmill exercise duration and sustained hemodynamic improvement. Enalapril was effective therapy for chronic CHF. Optimal short-term response may require coadministration of both intravenous and oral preparations of enalapril; however, the magnitude of the short-term response was comparable for both preparations. Long-term therapy is most effective when the drug is administered as a twice-daily regimen.", 
    "100": "Appreciation of the important role played by peripheral vasoconstriction in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF) has led to the widespread use of vasodilators as treatment. Short-term studies show that, regardless of the vasodilator used, the arterial and venous dilatation produced invariably results in improvement in the hemodynamic status of patients. This short-term response, however, does not automatically translate to long-term clinical improvement. The reasons for this are not well understood but such factors as differing mechanisms of action, development of tolerance and unique patterns of regional redistribution of blood flow may all play a modifying role in differentiating one vasodilator from another. Nevertheless, a number of controlled trials have demonstrated sustained symptomatic and functional improvement when vasodilators such as the converting enzyme inhibitors or nitrates are given to patients with CHF.", 
    "101": "The effects of mannitol, methylprednisolone, furosemide, inosine, indomethacin and captopril on the recovery from hydronephrosis were examined in rat kidneys. After 1 week of ureteral obstruction, left ureterocystostomy was performed in order to release the obstruction. Following ureteral release, mannitol, methylprednisolone, inosine, furosemide, captopril and indomethacin were given intravenously or orally. A saline group and non-treated control rats were also examined for comparison. 4 weeks after ureterocystostomy, 0.5 microCi of 203Hg-labelled chlormerodrin was given intravenously and the animals were sacrificed 48 h later. The left kidneys were significantly heavier in the mannitol-, methylprednisolone-, and inosine-treated groups than those of the control groups. The chlormerodrin uptake ratios of the left kidneys were significantly higher in the mannitol-, methylprednisolone-, captopril- and indomethacin-treated groups than in the control groups. These results suggest that the release of obstruction solely is not complete treatment for hydronephrosis, but that appropriate medical treatment may enhance the recovery from hydronephrosis.", 
    "102": "Vasodilators have been widely used in recent years for the treatment of severe left ventricular failure (LVF). However, amongst these drugs, not all have the same therapeutic effects, but they differ from one another in molecular structures, cellular mechanisms, haemodynamic actions and modes of administration. A three tier classification is proposed with the single objective of facilitating the therapeutic choice: mechanism of action: this property distinguishes the alpha-blockers from the beta-2 sympathomimetics, calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and prostacyclin biosynthesis inducers. Some molecules such as hydralazine, whose mechanism of action remains unclear, cannot be classified in this way; haemodynamic effects: these effects can be used to distinguish vasodilators which act mainly on the venous sector from arterial and mixed vasodilators. The knowledge of the preferential site ol action of these molecules helps to adapt the choice of treatment to the initial haemodynamic profile of each patient; pharmacokinetics: these properties distinguish molecules active only by intravenous administration, better adapted for the treatment of acute LVF in the intensive care unit, from those active orally which can be used for long-term ambulatory therapy of chronic cardiac failure. Trinitrin and its derivatives occupy an intermediate position because of their relatively low bioavailability after oral administration: long-term administration is not always easy and may require special modes of administration (i.e. percutaneous). Vasodilators have been widely used in cardiac failure for about 5 years; the results of some medium term controlled therapeutic trials are now available and confirm the efficacy of these drugs but also define their limitations: variable therapeutic efficacy: the number of responders ranges from 30 to 60 p. 100 according to the molecule used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "103": "The efficacy of peripheral vasodilators with different action mechanisms was studied and compared in 96 patients with chronic circulatory failure, stages IIB-III, of different genesis (rheumatic fever, congestive cardiomyopathy, postinfarction cardiosclerosis). Isosorbide dinitrate was used in 16 patients, nitroglycerin in 36, pratsiol in 24, and captopryl in 20 patients. Monitoring of the ECG, heart rate, respiratory rate and arterial blood pressure as well as catheterization of the right heart and tetrapolar impedance plethysmography were performed. The parameters of the heart pre- and afterload, pulmonary hemodynamics as well as those characterizing myocardial contractility were measured. It was established that the successful use of the different vasodilators rests on an adequate determinations of the indications for use. Captopryl is particularly effective in grave circulatory failure associated with a dramatic activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Pratsiol is effective in all the cases of chronic CF, since the tone of the sympathoadrenal system is virtually always high in patients with grave decompensation. Pratsiol was particularly efficacious in chronic CF with mitral or aortal regurgitation.",

    "105": "Suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may induce renal failure in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Recent scintigraphic studies with the glomerular tracer technetium-99m-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate (99m-Tc DTPA) indicate that in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may be markedly reduced in the affected kidney after inhibition of ACE. This finding reflects the important role of the RAS in maintaining GFR (by increasing postglomerular resistance) in states of low renal perfusion pressure. Preliminary observations suggest that this scintigraphic test might be useful in the detection of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "106": "The therapeutic efficacy of captopril, the inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme was studied in 18 patients with noticeable chronic cardiac insufficiency, who were refractory to foxglove drugs and diuretics. The use of captopril improved the patients' clinical status, significantly decreased the left ventricle volume and elevated the cardiac discharge. A simultaneous increase in diuresis during the day, favorable shifts in the electrolytic blood composition, a decrease in the concentration of blood plasma aldosterone and the level of carboxycatepsin in the blood serum were observed. Favorable changes in the hemodynamic and clinical-biochemical parameters during captopril therapy made it possible to achieve a positive therapeutic effect in 15 (83.3%) patients with refractory cardiac insufficiency. Subsequent recommendation of diuretics and maintenance doses of cardiac glycosides stabilized the therapeutic effect of captopril producing no complications. Thus, the incorporation of captopril in the management of severe refractory cardiac insufficiency was substantiated pathogenetically and found appropriate.", 
    "107": "Renal function studies were performed in 18 patients with nonseminomatous testicular cancer during four platinum-containing chemotherapy courses. The first 9 patients received chemotherapy alone, the second 9 also captopril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, in order to prevent cis-diamminedichloroplatinum-induced nephrotoxicity. In the first group a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, that was preceded by a fall in effective renal plasma flow, was observed. In the second group, captopril was able to prevent the initial decrease in effective renal plasma flow, but failed to prevent the ultimate decrease in glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "108": "The present study was carried out to test the hypothesis of a possible effectiveness of captopril--an enzymatic inhibitor of both angiotensin II formation and bradykinin degradation--on hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. In 6 patients with this clinical condition, captopril-induced changes in pulmonary hemodynamics were observed after the acute administration of the drug with and without a short period of oxygen therapy at a flow rate sufficient to keep the PaO2 over 60 mm Hg. In our patients, captopril significantly lowered pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance only when combined with oxygen, suggesting that an increase in bradykinin availability and/or a decrease in angiotensin II synthesis might be important factors in reversing pulmonary arterial hypertension only after blunting of the hypoxic stimulus on pulmonary circulation. Moreover, the authors suggest that the employment of vasodilators in the setting of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension should be considered not only as a means of relieving vasoconstriction but also as a possible tool for maintaining cardiac output and, in turn, peripheral oxygen delivery.", 
    "109": "Acute renal failure after captopril therapy in patients with transplant artery stenosis is well known. The study of a new observation may stress three particular points: 1) Diagnosis may be difficult just after transplantation in case of initial acute renal failure. 2) Renal function rapidly improved after withdrawing captopril and furosemide; after surgical treatment of the stenosis, a new course of captopril therapy was possible without any decrease of glomerular filtration rate. 3) A critical fall in filtration fraction seems to be the essential mechanism of renal failure, but specific interstitial lesions of the transplant showed on kidney biopsies, might be discussed.", 
    "110": "The effect of captopril, given in the drinking fluid, on the development of DOC-salt hypertension was analyzed. Although captopril did not prevent an increase in blood pressure (BP) elicited by DOC-salt, captopril did diminish BP in both DOC-salt and control animals. From the first week of treatment DOC-salt rats increased their fluid intake (FI). At the end of the experiment, captopril reduced this increment (655% to 357%). At the same time plasma angiotensinogen was diminished (-35%; p less than 0.001) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) substrate concentration increased (+33%; p less than 0.02) in DOC-salt rats, captopril did not modify these changes. In control rats captopril did not alter FI, depleted plasma angiotensinogen, (-73%; p less than 0.001), did not change the central prohormone and increased plasma renin activity (PRA) (+260%; p less than 0.001).",

Four patients failed to respond to any third-line agent; one patient responded to all three agents, two to nifedipine and captopril and one only to captopril. Third-line therapy is frequently ineffective and several agents may have to be tried to achieve an adequate response.", 
    "113": "Twelve patients with essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure, greater than 90 mmHg) after four weeks of treatment with captopril (50 mg BID) were randomly divided into two groups and treated with 12.5 mg and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide OD, in addition to captopril, in a crossover experimental design. Each dosage of hydrochlorothiazide was given for four weeks, with a two-week placebo washout period intervening. Both dosages of hydrochlorothiazide caused significant reductions in blood pressure. Eighty percent of patients achieved a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg during combination therapy, independent of the dose of diuretic. None of the patients reported significant side effects, and no changes were observed in routine biochemical analysis during treatment. In patients not completely controlled by captopril alone, a once-daily dosage of 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide proved as effective as a 25-mg once-daily dosage. The smaller dosage could result in fewer unwanted metabolic effects induced by diuretic administration.", 
    "114": "Recovery of renal function to a self-sustaining level was observed in 4 patients with accelerated malignant hypertension who required chronic hemodialysis therapy. Excellent blood pressure control was achieved in all the patients on captopril therapy. Hemodialysis could be discontinued after 2-9 months of captopril therapy; on recovery of renal function levels of creatinine clearance became stable ranging from 28 to 56 ml/min within 5-15 months of captopril treatment, and remained at this level during 21-64 months of observation. The management of hypertension and the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system afforded by chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is very promising as a means of reversing the process of malignant nephrosclerosis.", 
    "115": "Adult 13-lined ground squirrels were monitored for body temperature and state of torpor or arousal in a cold room at photoperiod LD 2:22 after receiving intraperitoneal injections of 0.9% saline vehicle or with the vehicle plus various test drugs. Saline injections (200 microliter) caused arousal of over 70% of the squirrels within 6 hours. Concomitant injections with Asp1 Val5 Angiotensin II (10 micrograms/kg, IP), however, significantly delayed arousal. This delaying effect was eliminated by simultaneous injections of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, sarlasin (Sar1-Ala8-Ang II; 50 micrograms/kg, IP), In addition, 30 hours after induced arousal, the group receiving nonapeptide angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (SQ 20, 881; 3 mg/kg) exhibited a significantly enhanced reentry into torpor. These data suggest that arousal from the reentry into torpor may be involved with renal function and the renin-angiotensin system. However, there appears to be temporal changes in the effect of angiotensin on torpor. Possible mechanisms, including the antagonistic effect of melatonin on angiotensin are discussed.", 
    "116": "A linkage between prorenin, renin, and intrinsic coagulation systems has been suggested recently. We studied the behavior of renin, prorenin, and kallikrein in a patient affected by congenital factor XII deficiency. Captopril test, upright posture, and furosemide administration provoked in our patients changes of renin and prorenin similar to those found in normal and hypertensive subjects. Unchanged kallikrein levels confirmed that no interaction between prorenin activation and factor XII-kallikrein system appears to be present.", 
    "117": "In isolated aortic rings and in vitro perfused mesenteric arteries of Wistar rats the vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine (NE) were not affected by captopril (2 X 10(-4) M). However, captopril (1 mg/kg i.v.) in pithed Wistar rats attenuated significantly the increases in diastolic blood pressure induced by NE. In pithed rats the effect of captopril on NE diastolic blood pressure responses disappeared either in the presence of an angiotensin II (5 ng X kg-1 X min) infusion or when the rats were previously nephrectomized. These findings suggest that the effect of captopril on vascular responses to norepinephrine is mediated by an inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and not by an antagonistic effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors.",

Acute hemodynamic effects were studied according to a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled protocol, by using two doses of Captopril (25 and 50 mg). The usual diuretic and digitalis treatment was kept unchanged throughout the trial. The acute administration of placebo associate with the usual doses of diuretic and digitalis was followed after 2 hours by a significant reduction of mean pulmonary wedge pressure (-23%, p less than 0.05). One hour following a single administration of Captopril, the following significant (p less than 0.05) changes were observed, respectively for the doses of 25 and 50 mg: heart rate -9% and -6%, cardiac index +13% and +10%, mean pulmonary wedge pressure -27% and -35%, mean pulmonary arterial pressure -29% and -26%, systemic vascular resistances -20% and -17%. A longer duration of effects on heart rate and cardiac index was noted after the 50 mg dose. All patients received long-term treatment with Captopril 75 or 150 mg daily. The NYHA functional class improved in all cases and there was a significant decrease of the cardio-thoracic ratio (from 0.61 +/- 0.05 to 0.55 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.01).

The base unit can then display the data in tabular or graphic form on its printer, or record it on a built in microcassette recorder. The data can readily be transferred to a main frame computer for subsequent analysis.

All the patients had persistent high arterial hypertension, which did not yield to conventional medical treatment, complicating hemodialysis extremely, as the procedure produced a critical increase of arterial blood pressure (ABP). The patients were given new hypotensive drugs (minoxidyl, captopril, prazosine), which lowered ABP and permitted a reduction of hypotensive injections during hemodialysis. Three patients were subjected to bilateral nephrectomy, which also considerably facilitated hemodialysis in these patients.",

The effects of captopril on haemodynamic and renal function were studied after 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours of treatment. After two hours, there was a mean reduction in systemic arterial resistance of 29%, in pulmonary arterial resistance of 18% and in pulmonary wedge pressure of 15%. The mean increase in the cardiac index was 28%. This marked initial haemodynamic improvement was either maintained or increased over the rest of the 24 hours. By 24 hours there had been a mean increase in urinary sodium excretion of 200%. The urinary sodium/potassium ratio increased from 0.62 to 1.45. Oral captopril thus seems suitable for treating low-output cardiac failure following surgery requiring extra-corporeal circulation.", 
    "123": "Fifty patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension were randomized (double-blindly) to treatment with either captopril (n = 26) or atenolol (n = 24). Their mean supine diastolic blood pressure after placebo was 100-125 mmHg. The study included an initial dose finding phase (12 weeks) during which the dosages of captopril and atenolol were increased stepwise every second week in order to obtain normotension (supine diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mmHg). Hydrochlorothiazide was added when necessary. During the second phase of the study the patients were followed on active treatment for 2 years. After the initial 12 weeks of active treatment, recumbent and standing blood pressures had fallen significantly both in the captopril group (by 31/20 and 33/19 mmHg, p less than 0.001) and in the atenolol group (by 24/18 and 30/20 mmHg, p less than 0.01 (systolic), p less than 0.001 (diastolic)). The antihypertensive effect was maintained in both groups during long-term treatment. The antihypertensive effect of both agents was potentiated to the same extent by addition of hydrochlorothiazide. Side-effects were few and mild. It can be concluded that both captopril and atenolol are safe and effective antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "124": "The effect of the combined therapy of d-propranolol and captopril was evaluated in post-ischaemic acute renal failure in rats. The glomerular filtration rate measured 24 hours after ischaemic insult in the animals receiving no drugs was 54 +/- 11 microliter/min/100g body weight while in animals treated with the combination of d-propranolol and captopril it was 305 +/- 35 microliter/min/100g body weight (p less than 0.05). The precise mechanism of protection afforded by the combination therapy is not clear, but this approach could be useful in protecting the kidney from ischaemic damage.", 
    "125": "To determine whether prostaglandins (PG) contribute to captopril-induced natriuresis, 20 hypertensive subjects were assigned to one of the following three groups: group a, captopril (C) administration; group b, C + indomethacin (I); group c, I alone. Captopril was given in a dose of 100, 200, 400 mg/day and indomethacin in a dose of 100mg/day for one week. In group a (n = 10), natriuresis was clearly increased in the seven day periods with captopril in a dose of 200 and 400mg/day but not at 100mg/day. After captopril 200 or 400mg/day, but not 100mg/day, urinary PGE2 and PGI2 excretion significantly increased while filtration fraction fell due to a rise in renal plasma flow. Plasma aldosterone (PA) significantly decreased after C(p less than 0.05). In group b (n = 7), natriuresis disappeared during captopril 200 or 400mg/day and indomethacin administration even when PA decreased as in group a. In group c (n = 3), natriuresis was unchanged. In conclusion, natriuresis by C is critically dependent upon increased secretion of PG.", 
    "126": "The effect on arterial pressure of incremental doses of norepinephrine (2 to 10 micrograms/min) and angiotensin II (50 to 800 ng/min) administered over 10 min periods was studied in sodium-replete hypertensive patients after crossover oral treatments with placebo, captopril 50 mg in a single dose, captopril 50 mg three times daily for one week and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg daily for a week. Neither captopril nor hydrochlorothiazide affected the dose response to infusions of angiotensin II. In comparison to placebo responses, however, both single and multiple-dose captopril therapy, and hydrochlorothiazide attenuated the pressor responses to infusions of norepinephrine. Captopril significantly depressed angiotensin converting enzyme activity from pre-dose levels and angiotensin II infusions significantly elevated plasma aldosterone concentrations. These results confirm findings reported for single dose captopril in normotensive volunteers and indicate that attenuation of the vascular responsiveness to sympathetic stimulation may contribute to the antihypertensive effects of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide therapy.", 
    "127": "After long-term captopril treatment, an inappropriate increase in aldosterone levels has been observed in hypertensive patients. It is not known, whether a similar change would occur in patients with severe congestive heart failure, and whether it is due to a decrease in endogenous dopaminergic inhibition of aldosterone secretion or to aldosterone stimulation by ACTH or an ACTH-related peptide. Therefore, the aldosterone and prolactin responses to metoclopramide have been studied in 10 patients with severe congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) after 6 months of captopril treatment, before and 11 h after pretreatment with dexamethasone. 7 placebo-treated patients served as double-blind controls. In captopril-treated patients, the supine aldosterone levels exceeded the normal range and were as high as in placebo-treated patients. The responsiveness of aldosterone and prolactin to metoclopramide was not influenced by captopril. Only in the placebo group were the aldosterone levels decreased by dexamethasone. Captopril increased plasma renin activity and serum potassium, and decreased supine epinephrine and norepinephrine and serum sodium. Thus, previous reports of inappropriately high aldosterone levels after long-term captopril treatment were confirmed in patients with severe congestive heart failure. It is concluded that increased aldosterone is due neither to a decrease in endogenous dopaminergic inhibition nor to dexamethasone-suppressible stimulation of aldosterone secretion.", 
    "128": "Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was used as a protective agent before and after 90 min of renal warm ischemia in rats. At a dose of 1 mg/kg, it was able to lower the postoperative serum creatinine values significantly (from 6.3 to 2.5 mg% on the 2nd postoperative day) in unilaterally nephrectomized animals. Increasing the dose to 4 and 8 mg/kg or combining captopril with hypertonic mannitol (10 ml/kg of a 15% aqueous solution) did not improve these figures significantly. The same magnitude of protection was obtained when captopril was given either before or just after the ischemia. In terms of mortality the differences among unprotected and protected groups were very important: only 6 of 24 unprotected animals survived the 5th postoperative day while 42 of 44 protected animals survived.", 
    "129": "35S-Captopril (50 mg/kg) administered i.v. to rats resulted in radioactivity being widely distributed into highly vascular tissues and into excretory organs. After oral administration of 14C-captopril (50 mg/kg), radioactivity in most tissues declined at a rate similar to that in blood. Concn. greater than those in blood were found only in kidney, liver and lung. The high concn. of 14C in kidney and liver were due to the excretory role of these organs. The high concn. of 14C in lung may be due to the high binding affinity of captopril to angiotensin-converting enzyme, present in large quantity in lung.", 
    "130": "Pressor effects of angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) on the human foetoplacental vasculature were compared in dual-perfused term placental cotyledons in which foetoplacental perfusion pressure was monitored. Arterial injections of 1 nmol doses of AI and AII caused marked increases in perfusion pressure; the mean pressor response to AI was 92.9 +/- 5.8% (mean +/- s.e. mean) of the AII response. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril at 2.2 microM reversibly reduced the AI response to 13.7 +/- 3.2% (mean +/- s.e. mean) of the AII response, which was unaffected. Saralasin, an AII receptor blocker, at 94 nM reversibly antagonized both AI-and AII-induced increases in foetoplacental perfusion pressure. It is concluded that foetoplacental vasoconstriction elicited by AI is due to its conversion to AII by angiotensin-converting enzyme present in the foetoplacental bed.", 
    "131": "The effects of nonpressor doses of intravenous angiotensin II and of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on renal excretory function were investigated in eight healthy volunteers during sustained water diuresis on a constant intake of 150 mmol sodium per day. The angiotensin II-analogue val5-angiotensin II-asp1-beta-amide was infused i.v. at an average dose of 2.6 ng kg-1 min-1 which was the highest dose without a significant effect on arterial blood pressure. This subpressor dose of angiotensin II significantly decreased urine volume, urinary excretion of sodium, chloride and phosphate and distal delivery [(CH2O + CCl)/GFR X 100] in the absence of changes in GFR or distal fractional chloride absorption [CH2O/(CH2O + CCl)]. In a second series of experiments, an oral dose of 50 mg of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was given to the sodium replete volunteers. In this study, captopril did not affect arterial blood pressure, GFR or any of the determined parameters of renal tubular function. Our results strongly suggest that the nonpressor dose of angiotensin II induced renal retention of sodium chloride via increased absorption in the proximal tubule. Thus, they further support the concept that angiotensin II participates in the regulation of renal sodium chloride excretion by affecting proximal tubular absorptive capacity. However, in the sodium replete stage, angiotensin II is of no major importance in regulating sodium chloride excretion.", 
    "132": "The modulating effect of captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, on the vascular permeability changes induced by intradermal injections of C5a, histamine and compound 48/80, was evaluated in guinea-pigs. Cutaneous vascular permeability changes were measured by the extravasation of intravenously injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. Intraperitoneal injection of 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg of captopril 30 min prior to the injection of C5a (10(-11) mol) significantly enhanced the increase in vascular permeability induced by this agent (P less than 0.02). This may be explained by the known property of captopril as an inhibitor of carboxypeptidase. No effect was observed when captopril was injected either 2 or 4 h before the injection of C5a. In contrast, the same doses of captopril, when injected intraperitoneally 2 h before the injection of histamine (10(-8) mol) or compound 48/80 (10 micrograms), significantly suppressed the increase in vascular permeability induced by these agents (P less than 0.02). This suppressive effect occurred in a captopril dose-dependent manner. The ability of captopril to modulate the vascular permeability response induced by vasoactive agents indicates that it is a potentially useful tool to dissect the relative roles of mediators involved in inflammatory processes.", 
    "133": "Several investigators have reported that hepatic metabolism of renin can be altered in pathophysiological states (e.g., high-output heart failure, cirrhosis, acute metal toxicity). The hypothesis that circulating angiotensin II may play a role in regulating renin metabolism by the liver was tested in anesthetized dogs. Captopril (SQ 14255) or an angiotensin II-competitive antagonist [( Sar1-Ile8]angiotensin II) was used for blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in two separate groups of dogs. The administration of captopril resulted in a significant fall in the percent extraction of renin by the liver (P less than 0.01) and in the clearance of renin (P less than 0.05). The group receiving the competitive antagonist and time-control animals showed no significant change in renin extraction or renin clearance by the liver. Our data do not support a role for angiotensin II in the regulation of hepatic metabolism of renin, since experiments utilizing the antagonist failed to produce a change. The mechanism by which captopril alters renin metabolism appears to be independent of its blockade of angiotensin II.", 
    "134": "A variety of experimental paradigms is now known to induce an appetite for NaCl solutions in rats. These include 1) bilateral adrenalectomy; 2) hypothyroidism; 3) salivariectomy; and 4) administration of hydrochlorothiazide, metyrapone, estrogen, methylxanthines, captopril, propranolol, large doses of deoxycorticosterone acetate, and intraperitoneal isotonic glucose or subcutaneous polyethylene glycol. A point of commonality among these is that a reduction in preference threshold accompanies the appetite for NaCl in all cases thus far tested. An additional point is the fact that each paradigm inducing a salt appetite, except salivariectomy, can be linked to an effect on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The level of angiotensin II in the brain may play a role in the induction of a salt appetite in the rat. It is clear, however, that modest doses of mineralocorticoid hormones, given in conjunction with the stimulus producing the salt appetite (e.g., adrenalectomy, thyroidectomy, or treatment with captopril), reduces NaCl intake to control level. Although this effect can be partially explained in most cases by the consequent reduction in angiotensin II production, the salt appetite that occurs when mineralocorticoid concentration in blood is high and angiotensin II concentration is low, or when both are low, requires another explanation. This may be related to the effect of mineralocorticoid hormones on salivary sodium concentration. The role of the concentration of sodium in saliva on intake of NaCl solution provides an alternative explanation for the induction of a salt appetite in rats and merits additional study.", 
    "135": "The ability of angiotensin to enhance the field-stimulation induced release of 3H-norepinephrine from the superfused rat portal vein was examined in vessels obtained from animals fed a normal (0.5% Na+) or low sodium diet (0.05% Na+). Angiotensin was seen to enhance the field-stimulation (480 pulses, 2 Hz, 1 ms duration, supramaximal voltage) induced release of 3H-norepinephrine from vessels obtained from Sprague-Dawley, Wistar, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) maintained on a normal sodium diet. The effect of angiotensin was attenuated when examined in vessels obtained from animals maintained on the low sodium diet. The selectivity of the low sodium diet for angiotensin was demonstrated by a lack of effect of the low sodium diet in altering the facilitatory effect of isoproterenol on the release of 3H-norepinephrine and an enhanced response to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist, yohimbine. The simultaneous treatment of rats with a low sodium diet plus captopril (estimated to be approximately 50 mg/kg/day for 7 days) prevented the attenuation of the angiotensin-induced enhancement of the release of 3H-norepinephrine seen by sodium alone. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that low sodium treatment increases circulating angiotensin levels which lead to a down-regulation of the angiotensin receptors located on adrenergic nerve varicosities.", 
    "136": "Captopril, the competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, is of considerable benefit in difficult-to-manage forms of hypertension. Its use has been associated with various untoward effects, but hepatic injury has not been widely reported. We treated a patient with captopril-associated cholestatic jaundice; a review of cases reported to the drug manufacturer and a review of the literature showed 13 additional cases of hepatic injury associated with captopril. In 9 of these the jaundice was categorized as cholestatic, and in 4 of the remaining 5 as mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular. These findings show that jaundice may be an idiosyncratic side effect of captopril, and that captopril-associated jaundice characteristically has strongly cholestatic features.", 
    "137": "We compared survival and the intensity of bronchoalveolar inflammation reflected by lung lavage after the intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin from Escherichia coli serotype 055B5 in rats breathing air and those breathing 60% oxygen for six days after endotoxin injection. Survival following 7.5 mg/kg of endotoxin was comparable in air-breathing rats (50%) and in oxygen-breathing rats (63%). Endotoxin caused a dose-dependent increase in the recovery of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from the lung. Oxygen breathing reduced the percentage of neutrophils recovered by lavage 24 hr after endotoxin from 17% to 9% after 2.5 mg/kg of endotoxin and from 34% to 12% after 7.5 mg/kg of endotoxin. The absolute number of neutrophils recovered was also significantly decreased in oxygen-breathing rats. The activity of pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been reported to be affected by oxygen tension, and ACE degrades bradykinin, a proinflammatory mediator. Therefore, we questioned whether the salutary effect of increased inspired oxygen tension on the magnitude of neutrophil influx into the airspaces could be related to changes in ACE activity. We found that after 48 hr of peroral pretreatment of the rats with captopril, a specific ACE inhibitor, there was increased recovery of neutrophils by lavage 24 hr after injection of endotoxin in air-breathing rats. Captopril pretreatment also increased the chemotactic activity of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). There was no concomitant alteration in the accumulation of 125I albumin in the lung following captopril pretreatment either in endotoxin-treated rats or in controls. Thus, breathing 60% oxygen decreased the accumulation of neotrophils in airspaces after intraperitoneal endotoxin injection and pharmacologic inhibition of ACE had the opposite effect. Alterations in the activity of pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme related to alveolar oxygen tension is a potential speculative mechanism for modulation of alveolar inflammation by the inspired oxygen concentration in this model.", 
    "138": "Captopril (50 mg orally) produced a significant fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in six normotensive sodium replete subjects, without a rise in heart rate. On captopril, there was no change in the expected normal increase in heart rate on standing. Supine plasma noradrenaline was not reduced by captopril and normal postural increases were maintained. Atropine (0.04 mg/kg i.v.) reduced the difference in blood pressure change between captopril and placebo. Facial immersion in water produced a bradycardia. This change was abolished by atropine and attenuated both by captopril and edrophonium (10 mg i.v.), a cholinesterase inhibitor. Lying down after 6 min standing produced an immediate transient tachycardia, which was abolished by atropine and attenuated by captopril. Blood pressure and heart rate rose after a cold pressor test on both captopril and placebo. The tachycardia during the Valsalva manoeuvre was inhibited by edrophonium and to a lesser extent by captopril. The effects of captopril and edrophonium were additive. Parasympathetic activity of captopril may contribute to its haemodynamic profile.", 
    "139": "Thirty patients with moderate to severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 115 mmHg), after a run-in wash out period of 15 days, were treated with muzolimine at a dosage of 20 mg once daily, given at 1 p.m., for three weeks. At the end of this period of treatment the patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mmHg started a double blind randomized study of comparison of nitrendipine, a vasodilator calcium antagonist agent, and captopril, an inhibitor of converting enzyme. The dosage was 10 mg twice daily for nitrendipine and 25 mg twice daily for captopril, the duration of each treatment being four weeks. At the end of 28 days of double blind treatment, the patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mmHg were treated with a triple combination: muzolimine plus nitrendipine plus captopril at the same dosage for a further four weeks. At the end of run-in and of each period of treatment blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in supine and erect positions and after a treadmill exercise test. At these times laboratory tests, including PRA and aldosterone, were performed. After the run-in period supine blood pressure was 189.6 +/- 13.9/123.1 +/- 7.7 mmHg. At the end of muzolimine treatment, supine blood pressure was 176.5 +/- 10.8/117.8 +/- 5.6 mmHg (p less than 0.001); at this time 4 patients had their diastolic blood pressure normalized and left the study. Thus 26 patients were randomized for comparative study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "140": "A patient with hypertension is shown to have both a renal artery stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia and a hypoplastic contralateral kidney, a condition comparable to that of the one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension. Both blood volume and plasma renin activity were increased. Blood pressure was lowered either by an angiotensin II analog or by captopril. Secretion of excess renin was observed only from the stenotic kidney. A 4-week period of captopril treatment was accompanied by an acute, reversible deterioration of renal function. Transluminal angioplasty corrected the abnormalities in renin and in blood volume and has kept blood pressure and renal function normal for over 2 years.", 
    "141": "A bradykinin potentiating peptide (BPP) was purified from the Chinese snake venom (Agkistrodon halys Pallas). The amino acid sequence of this BPP was determined to be pyroGlu-Gly-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Pro-Pro-Ile-Pro-Pro. Removal of the N-terminal residue with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase enhanced two-fold the activity of BPP, the resulting despyroGlu-BPP gradually lost its activity on further Edman degradation. However, around 90% of the original activity was still present in the C-terminal tripeptide Ile-Pro-Pro. Some analogs of this tripeptide were synthesized by the conventional method, and investigated by two biological assays, i.e., potentiating response on bradykinin (BK) and inhibitory activity on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). It was shown that the two biological activities inherent in the synthetic analogs were not parallel to each other. In addition, the isolated guinea pig ileum strips treated with chelating agent to irreversibly inactivate kininase (the same enzyme ACE) still responded to BPP. Consequently the potentiating effect of BPP on BK in vitro bioassay might be due to its influence on the binding receptor for BK rather than the inhibitory effect on kininase.", 
    "142": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a new class of drugs, whose main indications are the treatment of hypertension and of heart failure. Data obtained with captopril, the first orally active ACE inhibitor, affords an understanding of the rationale of their therapeutic use based on the knowledge of their mechanisms of action, efficacy, contraindications and precautions, dosage and frequency of administration, side-effects, interactions and advantages. ACE inhibitors appear to exert their haemodynamic effect mainly by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but also by modulating sympathetic nervous system activity and by increasing prostaglandin synthesis. Therefore they act both on vasoconstrictor and volume factors, since they cause vasodilation (the main effect) and mild natriuresis without affecting the heart rate and contractility and, probably, favourably influencing renal, coronary and cerebral circulation. So far it appears that ACE inhibitors can be usefully employed in the treatment of heart failure, in which they reduce both pre- and after-load, and mainly of hypertension. In the past captopril has been used to treat only severe and or resistant hypertension and some secondary forms, like renal parenchymal and renovascular hypertension, but now it seems that captopril is useful also to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension. Their efficacy in reducing blood pressure is similar to that of thiazide diuretics and of beta-blockers, the two drugs now considered of first choice and they exert their hypotensive action without the development of pseudotolerance or tolerance. ACE inhibitors seem, at the moment, contraindicated in pregnancy and in hyperkalaemic syndromes and must be used with caution in patients with collagen disease (mainly associated with renal failure), with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis (and with severe artery stenosis of a solitary kidney) and with severe sodium depletion. It is now established that captopril has a flat dose response curve and that it must be given (twice daily) at a dose not exceeding 150 mg/day. The same pharmacological approach must be used with future ACE inhibitors in order to establish the right posology and the frequency of administration. In this respect enalapril seems to be a promising ACE inhibitor with a prolonged action (at least 24 hours). The exact posology of ACE inhibitors might be crucial, since it has been shown that the side-effects of captopril (skin rashes, fever, taste disturbances, proteinuria and neutropenia) are dose dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "143": "The di-acid metabolite of enalapril, enalaprilat, and its lysine analogue lisinopril are potent inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE); they do not contain sulphydryl groups. Both drugs can be assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography and by radioimmunoassay and plasma ACE inhibition remains stable under normal storage conditions. It is therefore possible to study their pharmacokinetics as well as their pharmacodynamic effects in man. Enalaprilat and lisinopril as well as ACE activity have been measured in blood taken during the course of two studies of the effects of these drugs on blood pressure and autonomic responsiveness. A population pharmacokinetic analysis approach applied to a few concentration-time data points in each of a relatively large number of subjects provided average population parameter estimates of the absorption rate constant, volume of distribution and clearance which correspond closely with the limited published data based on conventional pharmacokinetic approaches. It also provided estimates of pharmacodynamic parameters and the concentration of the drug required to produce a 50% ACE inhibition. Population drug concentration data obtained in the course of early clinical evaluations of new drugs may provide a rational basis for dosage regimens with improved efficacy and, in particular, reduced concentration-related toxic effects.", 
    "144": "The acute effects of 25 mg captopril on blood pressure, heart rate, components of the renin-angiotensin system and blood concentration of bradykinin were followed in a single-blind placebo study of untreated (group A, n = 15) and thiazide-treated (group B, n = 13) patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. A drug-related fall in blood pressure was seen in both groups. The blood pressure reduction was more marked in group B than in group A. Heart rate remained unchanged. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin II decreased significantly with concurrent increases in plasma concentrations of renin and angiotensin I, indicating the in vivo inhibition of converting enzyme. Blood concentrations of bradykinin showed no systemic changes. The magnitude of blood pressure reduction was correlated both with the pretreatment levels and the concurrent decreases in plasma angiotensin II. Inhibition of angiotensin II formation can explain a large part of the acute hypotensive pharmacological action of captopril. Other vasoactive systems may be involved. The kallikrein-kinin system does not appear to participate as indicated by the unchanged concentrations of kinin in blood.", 
    "145": "The antihypertensive effect of enalapril maleate, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, was evaluated in a multiclinic, double-blind, randomized study in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The analyses were done in two ways, with patients who violated the entry criteria of the protocol excluded, and according to the intention to treat principle. Enalapril in dosages of 10 to 40 mg daily administered alone or concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide was compared to propranolol (80 to 240 mg daily) alone or concomitantly with the diuretic. The study showed that enalapril significantly lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. At each timepoint measured in the course of 26 weeks of therapy, the patients in the enalapril group consistently had greater decreases in blood pressure than patients in the propranolol group although not always significantly. The enalapril treatment group had a decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure of 22.2 mmHg compared to the propranolol group of 17.9 mmHg at the end of the study. These results were similarly independent of the way the data were analyzed. Fewer patients in the enalapril group required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide to maintain optimal control of blood pressure. Enalapril was found to be safe and well tolerated over the long-term of 48 weeks. Side effects such as leukopenia and taste perversions believed to be sulfhydryl-related were not encountered. The occurrence of rash and proteinuria was rare. Thiazide-induced hypokalemia, hyperuricemia and hyperglycemia appeared to be attenuated by enalapril. The favorable efficacy and side-effect profile provide the basis for enalapril to be a drug of choice when initiating antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "146": "The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated during the early phase of renal adaptation to sodium restriction. The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) MK 421 (MK) was studied when administered 3 days before and 6 days after sodium restriction. Mean arterial pressure, variations of urinary aldosterone, renal blood flow and sodium balance were studied. The results are the following; (Formula: see text) Those results demonstrate that CEI is associated with a renal inadaptation to sodium restriction. Other studies demonstrate that this disequilibrium persists during the second week of treatment in the rat. Those results may be related to an inhibition of aldosterone effect during the sodium restriction, a renal vasodilatation or an accumulation of kinin and endogenous prostaglandins. In summary, a functional RAAS is necessary during the functional adaptation to a sodium restriction. The renal prostaglandins stimulation may contribute to the disequilibrium balance in association with the CEI administration.", 
    "147": "To assess if dopaminergic control of aldosterone secretion is mediated by the renin-angiotensin system, the effect of chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition by enalapril on the aldosterone response to metoclopramide has been studied in 10 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Enalapril reduced supine blood pressure and increased the heart rate significantly. Plasma renin activity and urinary sodium excretion rose significantly. PRA was not changed by metoclopramide, neither during placebo nor during enalapril treatment. Metoclopramide induced a two-fold increase in plasma aldosterone, the peak response being reached within 15 min. Enalapril treatment did not alter the aldosterone response to metoclopramide. Dopaminergic control of aldosterone secretion appears to be independent of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "148": "The presence of isorenin active at the physiological pH was investigated in DOC-salt hypertensive rats. The effect of chronic captopril treatment was analyzed in similarly treated animals and in control rats. The levels of the plasma (PRA) and vascular enzyme (VRLA) were compared with those of untreated control animals. DOC-salt administration was maintained during 4 or 8 weeks. Captopril was given in the drinking fluid beginning 4 days before DOC-salt treatment. Renin-like activity was measured in the aorta and mesenteric arteries. DOC-salt treatment reduced PRA to almost undetectable levels while aorta renin-like enzyme only decreased to 50% at 4 weeks and was not changed at 8 weeks. Isorenin levels in the mesenteric artery did not show any significant variation. Captopril did not prevent the increase in blood pressure due to DOC-salt administration and it induced a significant increase in PRA and in VRLA in control rats whereas it did not increase either - enzyme in DOC-salt treated rats. In summary these results confirm the existence of a vascular isorenin and suggest that both binding and local synthesis of the enzyme could take place in the arterial wall.", 
    "149": "Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was given to 12 patients with renovascular hypertension: To five of them as a single drug after discontinuing other medications, and to seven patients as a substitute for one of their previous medications. The drug proved effective in controlling hypertension in all patients. Flushing and palpitations occurred in two of them, one of whom also showed a rise in creatinine and mild hyperkalemia. Two patients who had developed side effects while on captopril (renal deterioration in one, and severe rash in the other) tolerated enalapril well. Enalapril effectively reduced the blood pressure in the one patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis without causing renal failure.", 
    "150": "A radioimmunoassay (RIA) has been developed for the measurement of 2-[N-[(S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-(1S,3S,5S)- 2-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3-carboxylic acid (ramipril, Hoe 498) and its active metabolite (diacid: hydrolysis product of ramipril) in serum or plasma. Antibodies to the diacid were raised in rabbits against a lysine analogue conjugated to bovine serum albumin. A 125I-ramipril-diacid derivative was used as radioligand. Separation of the antibody-bound and free radiolabeled ligand was achieved by employing a polyethylene glycol solution. The RIA is specific for the active metabolite (diacid). Studies on specificity showed less than 0.6% cross-reactivity with intact ramipril or with dioxopiperazine metabolites. The levels for intact ramipril were obtained by prior enzymatic hydrolysis to the diacid. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.1 and 0.5 ng/ml for diacid and ramipril, respectively. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 3 to 14% at 1 to 30 ng diacid per ml. A recovery experiment yielded an average of 103%. The assay has been used to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of both ramipril and its pharmacologically active metabolite.", 
    "151": "Antihypertensive activity of alacepril (1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine, DU-1219), an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was investigated in hypertensive models with normal or low plasma renin activity (PRA). After single oral administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), alacepril (1-30 mg/kg) showed a dose related antihypertensive effect with a gradual onset and long lasting action. The maximum hypotensive effect was about 3 times more potent than that of captopril (3-100 mg/kg) on a weight basis. When comparing the AOC (area over the antihypertensive curve) values, the overall antihypertensive activity of alacepril was 8 times stronger than that of captopril. In deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt) hypertensive rats, alacepril (10-100 mg/kg) produced a significant and sustained hypotensive effect. The maximum hypotensive potency and the overall antihypertensive activity of alacepril were remarkably stronger than those of captopril (30, 100 mg/kg). During once daily successive oral administration for 10 days in SHR, alacepril (3-10 mg/kg/d) reduced dose relatedly the daily starting blood pressure. In DOCA-salt hypertensive rats and dogs, alacepril (30 mg/kg/d) produced a significant antihypertensive effect, while captopril (30 mg/kg/d) did not reduce daily starting blood pressure. Therefore, it may be expected that alacepril is a more effective antihypertensive agent than captopril in various hypertensions of different etiology.", 
    "152": "Alacepril (1-[(S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl]-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine, DU-1219) showed a dose related and long lasting antihypertensive effect in renal hypertensive rats (two-kidney, one-clip), a typical renin dependent hypertensive model. The maximum hypotensive potency of alacepril (1-30 mg/kg) after single oral administration was slightly weaker than that of captopril (1-30 mg/kg). Judging from the AOC (area over the antihypertensive curve) value, the overall antihypertensive activity of alacepril was 3 times more potent than that of captopril on a weight basis. The long lasting antihypertensive effect of alacepril in renal hypertensive rats was also confirmed by once daily successive oral administration (1-2 mg/kg/d). In renal hypertensive dogs, alacepril (3 mg/kg) showed a stable and sustained hypotensive effect, and its duration of action was longer than that of captopril. Although alacepril did not possess a significant in vitro angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, orally given alacepril (5.6-56.1 mg/kg) produced a potent and prolonged in vivo ACE inhibition which was estimated by suppression on angiotensin-I (310 ng/kg i.v.) induced pressor response in conscious normotensive rats. The prolonged in vivo ACE inhibitory activity of alacepril (5.6 mg/kg) was also observed in conscious normotensive dogs. These results suggest that the disposition and metabolism of orally given alacepril are responsible for the prolonged ACE inhibition and, concomitantly, for exerting the long lasting antihypertensive effect. Consequently, alacepril is a novel orally active ACE inhibitor having a potent and prolonged antihypertensive activity, and these properties suggest that alacepril is favorable for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "153": "Enalaprilic acid (MK 422), the active metabolite of enalapril, has recently become available for intravenous administration. In order to establish the proper dose for rapid blood pressure reduction, 9 patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension on a constant sodium intake of 100 mmol/24h were studied. They received four single doses of MK 422 according to an up-and-down titration schedule. Doses between 5 and 80 mg resulted in effective blood pressure reduction with an onset of action of about 10 minutes. Within this dose range the response was flat. No symptomatic hypotension was observed. The fall in blood pressure was less pronounced in patients with low initial plasma renin activity (PRA). Accordingly, a study was done to show whether the blood pressure response could be augmented by preceding stimulation of PRA by injection of 40 mg furosemide 15 minutes before the administration of MK 422. PRA increased after furosemide, but the blood pressure response to MK 422 was not augmented.", 
    "154": "The haemodynamic effects of enalapril (EN), a new, long-acting, nonsulphhydryl converting enzyme inhibitor, were evaluated by non-invasive methods in 10 adult patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH). Patients were randomly assigned, double blind to 2 treatment groups (EN 20 mg o.d. or 10 mg b.d.) for 4 weeks, and were crossed over to the other dosage regimen after a 2-week washout period. Measurements included mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), limb blood flow (LBF), plasma aldosterone (ALD), plasma renin activity (PRA) and systolic time intervals (STI). Both regimens (b.d. and o.d.) significantly reduced MAP (15.3% and 16.3%, respectively), total peripheral resistance (20.3% and 21.8%, respectively), limb vascular resistance (24.1% and 24.9%) and ALD (33.5% and 36.9%) and increased CO (7.8% and 8.7%), LBF (10.9% and 11.6%) and PRA (10.4% and 9.5%). No significant change was observed in HR or STI. EN 20 mg o.d. or 10 mg b.d. reduced arterial pressure to a similar extent through a fall in total peripheral resistance. An increase in CO was also observed.", 
    "155": "To investigate the cardiovascular effects of bradykinin (BK), the peptide was injected into 6 normotensive volunteers in the supine position. BK was given intravenously as a bolus in a dose of 0.001-7.5 microgram BK/kg body weight. Intraarterial blood pressure decreased dose related in a range of 0.25-1.0 microgram BK/kg body weight. Pretreatment with 2 X 50 mg indomethacin or 80 mg propranolol as well as changes in oral salt intake (from 10 to 300 mmol Na+/day) had no effect on the blood pressure-lowering effect of BK. Captopril (25 mg) potentiated the effect of BK 20- to 50-fold. In primary hyperaldosteronism, renal kallikrein activity and absolute vascular reaction to BK was increased. The results showed clearly that in man, similarly as in rats, BK lowers blood pressure by direct vasodilation and acts independently of prostaglandins, beta-receptors or salt intake.", 
    "156": "Vascular angiotensin converting enzyme could contribute to the elevated vascular resistance found in hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine if angiotensin converting enzyme activity was present in the hindquarter vasculature of one model of hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and its normotensive control, the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). We evaluated the effect of a maximal blocking dose of captopril (0.5 mg) on the angiotensin I pressor response during the infusion of the hindquarter with an artificial perfusate. Angiotensin I (1000 ng/ml) produced a significant increase in peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) in both SHR and WKY, but the increase was greater in SHR. Captopril inhibited the elevation in PVR in both. A lower concentration of angiotensin I (250 ng/ml) produced a significant and similar pressor response in SHR (less than the pressor response to 1000 ng/ml) and WKY (same as the pressor response to 1000 ng/ml). Again, captopril prevented the elevation in PVR to A1 in both SHR and WKY. Because these studies were performed using an artificial perfusate, angiotensin converting enzyme must be present in the SHR and WKY hindquarter vasculature including resistance vessels.", 
    "157": "The effects of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were compared with two of its analogs, L-N-(2-oxopiperidine-6-yl-carbonyl)-L-histidyl-L-thiazolidine-4-carbo xam ide (MK-771) and gamma-butyrolactone-4-carboxyl-histidyl-prolineamide (DN-1417) on the abrupt and naloxone-precipitated abstinence symptoms in morphine-dependent male Swiss-Wester mice. Mice were made physically dependent on morphine by subcutaneous implantation for 3 days of a pellet containing 75 mg morphine free base. Control mice were implanted with placebo pellets. Intracerebral administration of TRH (10 ng-10 micrograms per mouse) immediately after removal of placebo pellets had no effect on the basal temperature of mice. Mice implanted with morphine pellets exhibited a characteristic hypothermic response following the removal of the pellets. TRH at all doses employed prevented the hypothermia observed during abrupt withdrawal of morphine (pellet removal). DN-1417 and MK-771 (10 ng-10 micrograms per mouse) on the other hand produced a short lived hyperthermic response in mice from which placebo pellets had been removed. However, both TRH analogs produced long-lasting antagonism of withdrawal hypothermia in mice from which morphine pellets had been removed. TRH and its analogs had no effect on the body weight loss observed during abrupt withdrawal of morphine. Intracerebral administration of 10 micrograms TRH and its analogs inhibited the naloxone-induced jumping response as evidenced by increases in naloxone ED50 values to elicit this response. It is concluded that TRH and its analogs may be useful in combating some of the withdrawal symptoms in opiate-dependent subjects.", 
    "158": "The effects of enalapril on clinical well-being, treadmill exercise performance, haemodynamic measurements, hormone levels, and plasma biochemistry in patients with moderate heart failure, were assessed in a 12-week placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Maintenance frusemide and digoxin treatment was continued throughout the study. Compared with placebo, enalapril treatment improved clinical status and increased exercise capacity. The most obvious haemodynamic change was a fall in pulmonary artery wedge pressure and pulmonary artery pressure. Enalapril-induced increases in left-ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index, and falls in systemic arterial pressure, were small. Of the hormone indices measured, plasma renin activity rose 4-fold, angiotensin II and aldosterone fell slightly, and plasma catecholamines were unaltered by enalapril. Plasma potassium increased on average by 0.3 mmol/L during enalapril therapy. No adverse clinical or biochemical effects were observed. Enalapril has a sustained beneficial action in patients with moderate heart failure.", 
    "159": "24 hypertensive patients were randomised into 2 groups to compare the antihypertensive effects of enalapril and captopril over a 10-week period. In the hydrochlorothiazide run-in period, blood pressure was reduced from 171 +/- 4/109 +/- 1mm Hg to 160 +/- 4/103 +/- 1mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition decreased blood pressure to 132 +/- 3/87 +/- 2mm Hg. Captopril decreased diastolic blood pressure significantly more after 3 hours than enalapril (-24 versus -17mm Hg, p less than 0.05). After 10 weeks of therapy, this antihypertensive response was maintained at 134 +/- 3/83 +/- 1mm Hg. There was no difference between the captopril and enalapril treated groups. Acute and chronic responses of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and ACE were determined. There was an acute positive correlation between the rise in plasma renin activity and the fall in blood pressures with captopril but not with enalapril. With chronic treatment there was no difference in the ability of either of the 2 drugs to reduce blood pressure, inhibit ACE, reduce aldosterone or stimulate plasma renin activity.", 
    "160": "18 renovascular hypertensive patients were entered into a randomised, double-blind protocol to assess the safety and efficacy of enalapril (5 to 20 mg twice-daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 to 100 mg/day), versus triple-drug therapy employing hydrochlorothiazide (50 to 100 mg/day), timolol (10 to 30 mg twice-daily) and hydralazine (50 to 150 mg twice-daily). Specifically monitored were the effects of each drug regimen on blood pressure, plasma renin activity and angiotensin II, glomerular filtration rate by insulin clearance, and effective renal plasma flow by para-aminohippurate clearance. Results indicate that enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide was more effective than triple-drug therapy in lowering blood pressure. All patients on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide had excellent control of blood pressure, and there were no adverse effects. In contrast, 50% of the patients on triple-drug therapy had either uncontrolled blood pressure or significant drug-related side effects. Patients who were uncontrolled or intolerant of triple-drug therapy were well controlled on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide. Patients on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide demonstrated stimulation of plasma renin activity with inhibition of plasma angiotensin II, indicating adherence with therapy. Therapy for both unilateral and bilateral renovascular hypertension with enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide did not result in reductions in either glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow, except in 1 patient with a functional solitary stenotic kidney. In contrast, triple-drug therapy was generally associated with modest reductions in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, with a severe reduction in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow occurring in 1 patient with bilateral symmetrical renovascular disease. We conclude that the combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide is a safer and more effective regimen, compared with triple-drug therapy, for the treatment of renovascular hypertension.", 
    "161": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the natriuretic effect and renal haemodynamic changes induced by enalapril in patients with essential hypertension. In a group of 11 patients with mild to moderate hypertension with normal renal function, and on a controlled sodium intake (80 mmol/day), a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed (p less than 0.001) after 16 weeks of enalapril treatment (20 mg/day), without a change in heart rate. An increase in plasma renin activity (p less than 0.05) without changes in serum aldosterone, and a decrease in exchangeable sodium (p less than 0.001) were present at the end of the treatment period. In 10 hypertensive patients also taking a dietary sodium of 80 mmol/day, the renal haemodynamics, humoral changes, and urinary sodium excretion were measured during 4 days of enalapril treatment (20 mg/day). There was an increase in urinary sodium excretion on the 3rd and 4th days of treatment (p less than 0.01). The effective renal plasma flow and fractional sodium excretion increased 72 hours after the beginning of treatment (p less than 0.01); the glomerular filtration rate did not change, and filtration fraction decreased at 72 hours. Mean blood pressure fell 2 hours after the first dose (p less than 0.01), and the maximum drop in intrarenal vascular resistance occurred after 72 hours of treatment (p less than 0.01). Plasma renin activity increased (p less than 0.05) and serum aldosterone decreased (p less than 0.01) 2 hours after the first dose. Thereafter, serum aldosterone increased progressively until it reached values similar to those with placebo at 48 and 72 hours of treatment. Urinary kallikrein fell during the 2nd and 3rd day of treatment (p less than 0.01). It was concluded that the decrease in exchangeable sodium was due to a natriuretic effect of enalapril. This effect presumably results from renal haemodynamic changes due to the reduction of angiotensin II. Other mechanisms, such as the reduction of aldosterone and accumulation of kinins, could be contributory factors.", 
    "162": "It is now well recognised that the renin-angiotensin system plays a key role in the control of blood pressure not only through circulating angiotensin II but through its interaction with the autonomic and central nervous systems. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have proved to be effective in lowering blood pressure in different types of hypertension. This study evaluates the antihypertensive effects of enalapril, a new, potent, long acting ACE inhibitor. 50 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were included in 4 groups. Group I was used to compare the effects of enalapril and propranolol on blood pressure, renal function, plasma renin activity, aldosterone excretion and plasma lipids in 24 patients after 23 weeks. Group II was used to evaluate long term effects (48 weeks) of these drugs in 13 patients. Group III included 32 patients that received enalapril as monotherapy for 6 to 12 weeks. Group IV was studied to estimate the antihypertensive effect of low doses of hydrochlorothiazide in 18 patients receiving enalapril. The effect on mean blood pressure was similar with enalapril and propranolol (enalapril 117 versus 103 mm Hg and propranolol 115 versus 104 mm Hg); however, the glomerular filtration rate decreased with propranolol (105 versus 87 ml/min; p less than 0.05) and was unaltered with enalapril (102 versus 98 ml/min). Triglycerides rose with propranolol (179 versus 231 mg/dl; p less than 0.05) and did not change with enalapril (157 versus 121 mg/dl). In the long term, antihypertensive effects were similar and no significant side effects were observed. In 14/32 patients blood pressure became normal with enalapril alone. Low doses of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg) decreased mean blood pressure by 10mm Hg when added to enalapril. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril was similar to that of propranolol; however, the lowering effect on glomerular filtration rate of propranolol did not occur with enalapril. A slight rise in triglycerides occurred only with propranolol. No significant side effects were observed with either propranolol or enalapril. Used as monotherapy, enalapril normalised blood pressure in 44% of cases. Addition of low doses of hydrochlorothiazide significantly increased the antihypertensive effect of enalapril.", 
    "163": "Arterial hypertension is by definition a haemodynamic disorder. At least 3 different subsets of cardiovascular pathophysiological features can be identified in so-called essential hypertension: The young lean patient characterised by an elevated cardiac output and renal blood flow, elevated plasma renin activity and circulating catecholamine levels, as well as symptoms and signs of hyperadrenergic hypertension. The elderly patient characterised by a low cardiac output often with left ventricular hypertrophy, elevated total peripheral resistance, nephrosclerosis, and symptoms and signs of target organ disease. The obese patient (and to a lesser degree the black patient) characterised by expanded fluid volume state, elevated cardiac output, a normal to low total peripheral resistance, and symptoms and signs of volume overload. To initiate antihypertensive therapy, the drug of choice in the young patient is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker; in the elderly it is a haemodynamic vasodilator (anti-adrenergic drug, slow channel calcium blocker, or converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor), and in black or obese patients it remains a thiazide diuretic. Enalapril, a new ACE inhibitor is indicated as a first-step agent in the great majority of hypertensive patients in whom the elevated arterial pressure should be reduced by a decrease in total peripheral resistance, without compromising systemic or regional blood flow. In contrast to other antihypertensive agents, enalapril will lower preload and afterload to the left ventricle while improving systemic and regional flow in elderly patients with latent or manifest congestive heart failure.", 
    "164": "Enalapril, an orally-active, long-acting, nonsulphydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is extensively hydrolysed in vivo to enalaprilat, its bioactive form. Bioactivation probably occurs in the liver. Metabolism beyond activation to enalaprilat is not observed in man. Administration with food does not affect the bioavailability of enalapril; excretion of enalapril and enalaprilat is primarily renal. Peak serum enalaprilat concentrations are reached 4 hours post-dose, and the profile is polyphasic with a prolonged terminal half-life (greater than 30 hours) due to the binding of enalaprilat to ACE. Steady-state is achieved by the fourth daily dose, with no evidence of accumulation. The effective accumulation half-life following multiple dosing is 11 hours. Higher serum concentrations and delayed urinary excretion occur in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Enalapril reduces blood pressure in hypertensive patients by decreasing systemic vascular resistance. The blood pressure reduction is not accompanied by an increase in heart rate. Furthermore, cardiac output is slightly increased and cardiovascular reflexes are not impaired. Once- and twice-daily dosage regimens reduce blood pressure to a similar extent. Enalapril increases renal blood flow and decreases renal vascular resistance. Enalapril also augments the glomerular filtration rate in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 80 ml/min. Enalapril reduces left ventricular mass, and does not affect cardiac function or myocardial perfusion during exercise. There is no rebound hypertension after enalapril therapy is stopped. Enalapril does not produce hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperuricaemia or hypercholesterolaemia. When combined with hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril attenuates the undesirable diuretic-induced metabolic changes. Therapeutic doses of enalapril do not affect serum prolactin and plasma cortisol in healthy volunteers or T3, rT3, T4 and TSH in hypertensive patients. Enalapril has natriuretic and uricosuric properties. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril is potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide, timolol and methyldopa, but unaffected by indomethacin and sulindac. No interactions occur between enalapril and frusemide, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin and warfarin. The bioavailability of enalapril is slightly reduced when propranolol is coadministered, but this does not appear to be of any clinical significance. Enalapril increases cardiac output and stroke volume and decreases pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "165": "The major steps in the initial development of angiotensin I conversion inhibitors are described, from the discovery of the Bothrops peptides (bradykinin potentiating factor) to the demonstration of the therapeutic potential. It is a history where chance, serendipity and clear scientific reasoning weaved together the work of several scientists. It is also a classical example of drug development for which the initial basic research was made at the university, but the useful product was achieved by industry.", 
    "166": "Enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide were administered over an 8-week period to groups of Dahl salt-sensitive and Dahl salt-resistant rats receiving either a high (8%) or low (0.4%) salt diet. Regional differences of interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular free wall thickness, right ventricular free wall thickness, right ventricular weight/body weight ratio, left ventricular weight/body ratio, and heart weights were determined. For salt-sensitive rats of both diet groups, lowering of blood pressure induced by either drug was associated with a reduction in cardiac weight which was localized to the left ventricle. For salt-resistant rats, irrespective of diet, the associated reduction of cardiac mass induced by enalapril maleate was largely confined to the right ventricle. Regional changes in tissue thickness were, however, not always associated with corresponding changes in tissue mass or blood pressure. These regional modulations appeared to be quite dependent on salt intake and the nature of the antihypertensive drug, for a given animal type, suggesting that pressure afterload is not the only factor in the pathogenesis of left and right ventricular hypertrophy. The responses of the right ventricle were not necessarily the same as those of the left ventricle to identical dietary and drug regimens. In all animal groups, ventricular mass and tissue thickness did not always change in the same sense, suggesting that alterations in the nature and packaging of the cellular constituents may be induced by the combined actions of the dietary salt and antihypertensive medications.", 
    "167": "Enalapril (MK-421) was administered orally as a single dose of 2.5, 5.0, 10 and 20 mg to 13 patients with either essential or renovascular hypertension. At these doses, enalapril produced a moderate reduction in both supine and standing blood pressure as well as a significant reduction in angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity, an increase in peripheral plasma renin activity and a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration 4 to 8 hours after administration of the drug. Plasma levels of prostaglandins E1 and E2 were unchanged. The calculated ratio of urinary Na/K was increased in the patients with renal artery stenosis after enalapril. Creatinine clearance was increased in the patients with essential hypertension and reduced in the patients with renal artery stenosis. No adverse effects occurred in these patients treated with single doses of enalapril.", 
    "168": "Nifedipine long acting tablets were substituted for converting enzyme inhibitors in eight patients with renovascular hypertension. A significant drop in blood pressure was observed. Nifedipine was shown to be as effective (in lowering blood pressure) as a drug that acts directly on the renin angiotensin system. These data offer support for previously reported findings that the action of angiotensin II is calcium mediated.", 
    "169": "Lesions of the ventrolateral medulla of the rabbit, coinciding with the A1 noradrenaline cell bodies (A1 lesions) produced fortyfold increases in the plasma levels of vasopressin and adrenaline, a twofold increase in plasma noradrenaline and a substantial increase in plasma renin activity. These increases accompanied the hypertension and bradycardia that follow A1 lesions. The vasoconstriction and hypertension were completely abolished by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, when it was administered before lesions and were markedly reduced when it was given after lesions. On the other hand, administration of an antagonist to the vasoconstrictor action of vasopressin (d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor had little effect. Prior removal of the adrenal glands prevented any rise in plasma adrenaline levels but had no effect on the pressure response to subsequent A1 lesions. These results indicate that the vasoconstriction and hypertension were predominantly mediated by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, acting mainly through sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves. The fall in heart rate following A1 lesions was approximately halved by pretreatment either with d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP alone, or by blockade of the vagus and sympathetic with scopolamine and propranolol; it was completely abolished by combined pretreatment with all three agents. The experiments show that vasopressin release makes a major contribution to the bradycardia acting at least in part through mechanisms that are independent of cardiac vagal or sympathetic nerves.", 
    "170": "Changes in plasma levels of active and inactive renin after the treatment with enalapril maleate (MK-421), a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were studied in five patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) due to unilateral renal artery stenosis. The dosage was increased when the blood pressure (BP) was not normalized for more than 3 days. Blood sampling was performed before, and 5 hours and 24 hours after the first administration, and on the 3rd day with each dosage. Active and inactive renin concentrations (ARC and IRC) showed a reciprocal change in 4 cases, 5 hours after the first dose. In the chronic treatment, ARC and IRC before the morning dose did not change apparently until the BP was normalized, when both ARC and IRC were evidently increased. It was suspected that a conversion from inactive to active renin may occur in the patients with RVH, when the active renin secretion is stimulated suddenly by the first dose of MK-421. The chronically diminished perfusion pressure in the kidney may stimulate the secretion of inactive renin, but the decrease in endogenous angiotensin II may not.", 
    "171": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors promise to make important therapeutic contributions to the control of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The nonapeptide teprotide was the first of these inhibitors to be tested clinically. It was followed by orally active inhibitors, captopril in 1977 and enalapril in 1980. The latter is representative of a new design for the inhibition of metallopeptidases and is the subject of this review. The best of the N-carboxyalkyldipeptide inhibitors inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme with a Ki of 7.6 X 10(-11) M. This compound is the most potent competitive inhibitor of a metallopeptidase yet to have been reported. The basis of this high potency is beginning to be understood and in part is considered to involve precisely arranged multiple interactions within the enzyme active site. X-ray crystallography of a thermolysin-inhibitor complex has been achieved. Assuming that similar interactions within the active site of angiotensin-converting enzyme are mechanistically probable, the authors hypothesize the binding of enalaprilat to converting enzyme as shown in Figure 24. Such interactions are consistent with kinetic studies (Section V) with the understanding that binding to the enzyme is not sensitive to the inhibitor's state of NH protonation. The reason for this surprising conclusion has not been established. Perhaps counterbalancing factors are involved in the energetics of binding or there may be compensating adjustments made in the enzyme which permit NH protonated and nonprotonated inhibitor to bind equally well. Figure 24 also summarizes present understanding of the conformation of enalaprilat when bound to angiotensin-converting enzyme. From studies on conformationally defined analogs of enalaprilat, it seems likely that the Ala-Pro segment of enalaprilat binds in a conformation that is close to a minimum energy conformer. This situation no doubt contributes to the potency of enalaprilat, since little binding energy would be needed to induce conformational changes in this part-structure of enalaprilat when it is bound to the enzyme. The phenethyl group of enalaprilat is believed to be near the alpha-hydrogen of the L-Ala residue in the enzyme-inhibitor complex. However, the synthesis of conformationally restricted analogs to establish this point has not yet been reached. The N-carboxyalkylpeptide design was developed from Wolfenden's collected product inhibitors of carboxypeptidase-A. Whether or not N-carboxyalkyldipeptides should be classified as collected product or transition state inhibitors is unclear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "172": "In order to establish any psychotropic effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, the drug was administered in doses of 20 mg every morning for 14 days to 12 normal subjects, and compared with placebo on a battery of physiological, psychological and subjective tests, before and after the dose on the 1st and 14th days. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced and heart-rate increased by enalapril as compared with placebo; one component (P1-N1) of the auditory evoked EEG response was increased and tapping rate quickened. The commonest side effect was tiredness. It was concluded that enalapril (unlike most other antihypertensive agents) did not lower mood but could enhance attention and alertness.", 
    "173": "We have examined the systemic and renal effects of 2 weeks' administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) to both normal and chronic NaCl-depleted Munich-Wistar rats and focused particularly on the factors contributing to the significant hypotension observed during surgery and anesthesia and the response of renal glomerular hemodynamics under these conditions. At renal micropuncture, mean arterial pressure was decreased in rats receiving CEI on normal and NaCl-depleted diets (72 +/- 5 and 78 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) but nephron filtration rate (sngfr) was well maintained since plasma flow was not altered and glomerular capillary pressure only slightly decreased. Negative Na+ balance in NaCl-depleted CEI rats correlated with decreased awake blood pressures. Under surgery, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were not increased in CEI rats in spite of hypotension, and diminished adrenergic responses may contribute to systemic and renal effects observed. Nephron plasma flow and sngfr are remarkably well preserved during CEI in spite of hypotension due to marked afferent arteriolar dilation.", 
    "174": "With the aim of producing an analgesia physiologically induced by endogenous opioids, several series of inhibitors of the degradation enzymes of enkephalins have been synthetized by using as a model, at the atomic level, the active site of thermolysin, a bacterial endopeptidase similar to enkephalinase. Thiorphan and retro-thiorphan are very potent inhibitors of enkephalinase (KI = 2 nM), but the retro compound is more selective, as it is unable to recognise the angiotensin conversion enzyme. Recently, a series of inhibitors containing a bidentate group were found to be capable of inhibiting the three metallopeptidases which break down the enkephalins. One of these compounds, kelatorphan, totally protects, in vitro and in vivo, Met-enkephalin from enzymatic degradation. Kelatorphan is the first complete inhibitor of enkephalin metabolism and is the only compound to possess an analgesic activity greater than that of a mixture of thiorphan and bestatin (non-specific aminopeptidase inhibitor). A tritiated derivative of kelatorphan has been used to visualise the enkephalinase in the rat brain by means of autoradiography. The enzyme has a heterogeneous distribution with a particularly high concentration in the nigro-striatal system.", 
    "175": "During treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, Captopril, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased in three unilaterally nephrectomized hypertensive patients with a poorly functioning remaining kidney. The fall in GFR was not related to changes in the blood pressure, and was reversed when Captopril was stopped. In a fourth nephrectomized patient the initially normal GFR was not affected by captopril. These observations point to a functional reduction in GFR due to a withdrawal of an intrarenal action of angiotensin II. Maintenance of GFR may become critically dependent on a functioning renin-angiotensin system when renal perfusion pressure is reduced to a certain degree. Inhibition of angiotensin II formation may lead to a decrease in GFR in patients with renal hypertension and pre-existing renal insufficiency.", 
    "176": "The converting enzyme inhibitor CGS 14824A was evaluated in 15 healthy male volunteers. First, the efficacy of a single 5 or 10 mg oral dose in antagonizing the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I was tested in 2 subjects. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously through an intra-arterial catheter. CGS 14824A 5 mg reduced the response to angiotensin I within 75 min to 50%, and 10 mg within 1 h to less than 25%, and for a period of more than 4 h. Subsequently, plasma renin and converting enzyme activity, plasma angiotensin I, angiotensin II and aldosterone were measured serially before and up to 72 h following oral administration of 2, 5, 10 or 20 mg CGS 14824A to groups of 5 volunteers. Plasma converting enzyme activity fell to well below 10% of baseline within 1 h after administration of 5 mg or more CGS 14824A. Within 2 h following 2 mg p.o., a similarly low level was reached. Twenty four hours following the 20 mg dose, plasma converting enzyme activity was still below 10%. As expected, plasma renin activity and angiotensin I rose while angiotensin II and aldosterone fell following the 2 mg dose. This pattern of effects was enhanced by increasing the dose. Nonetheless, 24 h after the 20 mg dose, plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone had returned to their baseline levels. No side-effects occurred. Thus, in normal volunteers, CGS 14824A was an effective, potent and long acting converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "177": "Previous studies have shown that the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) has a preference for 0.9% NaCl solution over water as a drinking fluid. This preference was decreased by chronic treatment of SHR with intracerebroventricular captopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor). Although other strains of rats were compared to SHR, no studies, that we are aware of, have been reported in renal hypertensive rats. Wistar-Kyoto rats were sham operated or had a silver clip (i.d., 0.20 mm) placed on the left renal artery to produce renovascular hypertension. Three weeks later the rats were operated upon again to implant osmotic minipumps to deliver captopril or saline either into the right lateral brain ventricle (i.c.v.) or into the peritoneal cavity (i.p.). The rats had a choice of 0.9% NaCl or tap water during the study. Blood pressures were measured by a tail plysmographic method in the conscious rats. The rats that became hypertensive showed a marked preference for saline. Treatment with captopril i.p. (24 mumol/kg/day) stimulated preference for saline but i.c.v. treatment (24 mumol/kg/day) decreased the preference for saline despite reductions in blood pressure in both groups of renal hypertensive rats. These changes were not seen in renal hypertensive rats infused with saline. The results suggest that captopril's antihypertensive effect in this model of renal hypertension may be independent of the effects of the drug on preference to drink saline.", 
    "178": "Orthostatic cardiovascular reflexes were evaluated in conscious cynomolgus monkeys during interruption of the renin-angiotensin system with the renin inhibitor: RIP (Pro-His-Pro-Phe-His-Phe-Phe-Val-Tyr-Lys-OH). RIP was synthesized via solid phase techniques and purified to homogeneity. In vitro studies indicated that it exhibited classical competitive inhibition of renin with a KI of 2.3 microM. In vivo, RIP at 2 mg/kg per min inhibited renin and angiotensin I pressor responses indicating that it was not a specific renin inhibitor at this dose. However, in spite of the nonspecificity, RIP did not affect the supine blood pressure of sodium-replete monkeys, but did evoke hypotension in supine sodium depleted monkeys. RIP did not elicit significant orthostatic hypotension in either sodium-replete or sodium depleted monkeys. The cardiovascular effects of RIP described in this study appear to be due to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "179": "Serum angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) was measured in 10 patients with Graves' disease and 2 with thyroiditis during different stages of the diseases. The effect of thyroxine on serum ACE levels was also recorded in 12 patients with thyroid cancer, who were on thyroxine suppression. Serum ACE levels correlated positively with clinically assessed thyroid function and peripheral thyroid hormone levels, especially during hyper- or hypofunction. ACE was measured both with an enzyme kinetic and a new, quantitative inhibitor binding assay. The methods gave similar results, which indicates that ACE increments during thyroid hyperfunction were quantitative, and not a result of increased enzyme activity. Serum ACE increments associated with high lysozyme concentrations are signs of immunologic activation or proliferation of monocytic cells. In this study there was no correlation between the two enzymes, which may indicate either increased synthesis or possibly shedding of ACE from endothelial cells or delayed metabolic clearance of this enzyme. Serum ACE measurements may provide a useful tool for assessing thyroid function and the effect of thyroxine treatment.", 
    "180": "The synthesis of 5 analogues of the effective inhibitor of peptidyl dipeptidase, teprotide, has been carried out. The inhibitory and bradykinin-potentiating activity of these compounds has been assayed. N-Terminal pyroglutamic acid and positive charge of arginine in position 4 were found to be essential for biological activity of the inhibitor.", 
    "181": "Captopril (SQ 14225), an orally active angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), increases natriuresis and diuresis in man and experimental animals in vivo, as well as in the isolated perfused rat kidney, raising the possibility of a direct renal action of the drug. We tested this hypothesis by studying its effects in the isolated toad skin, a model of the distal nephron devoid of vascular and nervous influences. When added to the dermal bath, captopril caused a reversible, concentration-related decrease in short-circuit current (SCC), a measure of active transepithelial Na transport. Keeping the toads in 0.1 M NaCl for 4 or more days increased sensitivity to the drug, which then inhibited SCC maximally (49 +/- 12% at 3.4 X 10(-3) M, P less than 0.01, n = 10), suggesting its effect might be modulated by endogenous mineralocorticoid activity. Captopril also inhibited the increase in SCC and in osmotic water permeability caused by neurohypophyseal peptides (NHP). The increases in SCC by non-peptidic agents (nystatin, a polyene antibiotic, or norepinephrine, an adrenergic agonist) were not altered, ruling out a generalized toxic effect, or any significant inhibition of the Na pump by captopril. The apparently specific effect of the drug on the permeability responses to NHP seems to be exerted proximally to the apical border, since the response of the latter to other agents was preserved. The present data suggest SH groups may be involved, since other CEI lacking such groups (teprotide and MK-422) do not produce such effects. These observations support the notion that a direct tubular effect may be involved in the increased diuresis and natriuresis observed after administration of captopril.", 
    "182": "We investigated cardiac and peripheral hemodynamics in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in comparison to normal controls. Diabetic rats showed a significantly decreased cardiac output and heart rate, with unchanged mean blood pressures. Regional blood flows were unchanged except for renal blood flow which was significantly lower. The low output state associated with diabetes was reversed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with MK-422, but not with dobutamine, although both agents caused similar reduction in peripheral vascular resistance. However, despite improved left ventricular performance, renal perfusion did not improve after MK-422.", 
    "183": "Captopril (SQ14,225), an orally administered angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was given to 8 patients with idiopathic edema, in order to study the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in orthostatic sodium and water retention. Compared to 5 normal subjects, patients with idiopathic edema showed significantly greater reduction in water and sodium excretion, and greater increment in plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity, in the upright posture. Captopril significantly restored water and sodium excretion, attenuated the increment in plasma aldosterone, and enhanced the rise in plasma renin activity in patients with idiopathic edema. The effects of captopril on these variables were not remarkable in normal subjects. These results suggest that an enhanced response of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to standing plays an important role in the pathophysiology of idiopathic edema.", 
    "184": "We evaluated 9 patients with transplant renal artery stenosis. Captopril treatment always resulted in a dramatic decrease in renal function. Moreover, only in patients (n = 2) with a stenosis in one out of more renal arteries a satisfying fall in blood pressure was achieved. Surgical reconstruction of the stenosis was successful in 4 out of 5 patients. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition in transplant renal artery stenosis often leads to loss of graft function, probably due to efferent vasodilation.", 
    "185": "Experimental study in 156 white rats with renovascular hypertension, posthemorrhagic hypotension and with normal blood pressure revealed that high--ressure oxygen (303.9 kPa--50 min) could activate angiotensin--converting enzyme, the latter taking part in inactivation of endogenous opioid peptides. Involvement of peptide--like links in hemodynamic responses to hyperoxia seems to be an important component of the mechanism of oxygen action upon the cardiovascular system.", 
    "186": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of enalapril maleate, a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, are reviewed. Enalapril is rapidly converted by ester hydrolysis to enalaprilat, a potent ACE inhibitor; enalapril itself is only a weak ACE inhibitor. Enalapril lowers peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate. In patients with congestive heart failure, enalapril has beneficial hemodynamic effects based on reduction of both cardiac preload and afterload. Approximately 60% of a dose of enalapril is absorbed after oral administration. Excretion of enalaprilat is primarily renal. Accumulation of enalaprilat occurs in patients with creatinine clearances less than 30 mL/min. Enalapril 10-40 mg per day orally has shown efficacy comparable to that of captopril in treating patients with mild, moderate, and severe hypertension, hypertension caused by renal-artery stenosis, and in congestive heart failure resistant to digitalis and diuretics. When given alone for hypertension, enalapril has efficacy comparable to that of thiazide diuretics and beta blockers. Side effects observed with enalapril have generally been minor. Captopril-associated side effects such as skin rash, loss of taste, and proteinuria have been observed in a small number of patients receiving enalapril to date; neutropenia less than 300/mm3 has been noted with captopril but not enalapril. The incidence of these side effects has been noted to be greatly decreased in patients on low doses of captopril. Enalapril appears to be similar in efficacy to captopril for treating hypertension and congestive heart failure. Whether enalapril is safer than low-dose captopril in patients at high risk for captopril-associated side effects will require further investigation.", 
    "187": "The trophic effects of chronic potassium loading on the rat zona glomerulosa were investigated by morphometric and radioimmunological methods. Potassium loading exerted a potent adrenoglomerulotrophic effect in saline treated control rats, but it was not able to reverse the captopril- and dexamethasone-induced atrophy of the zona glomerulosa. However, if the captopril/dexamethasone administered rats were given maintenance doses of angiotensin II and ACTH, potassium loading was found to exert a strong trophic action. The hypothesis is advanced that potassium loading requires the integrity of both the renin-angiotensin system and the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis to exert its powerful direct stimulating effect on the growth and steroidogenic capacity of the rat zona glomerulosa.", 
    "188": "The antihypertensive effect of a non-sulfhydryl, long acting ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor, MK-421, was evaluated by administering a single dose of 10 mg to 13 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The pharmacokinetic profile of MK-421 and its potent active metabolite, MK-422, was also assessed, together with the effect on the various components of the renin-angiotensin system. A single dose of MK-421 produced a significant fall in MBP from 2 to 24 hours post-drug. As could be expected, plasma ACE activity was suppressed up to 24 hours after MK-421. The half-life of MK-422, Cmax and [AUC]24(0) of MK-421 and MK-422 were measured. No significant change in plasma bradykinin or urinary excretion rate of kallikrein was observed, whereas a slight increase was observed in the urinary excretion rate of kinins after MK-421 in 8 patients. Significant correlations were observed between pretreatment PRA levels and the maximum fall in MBP.", 
    "189": "To test the hypothesis that intravenous enalapril is a useful pharmacologic probe of the renin angiotensin system, intravenous enalapril was administered to 9 patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). This produced abrupt and complete blockade of converting enzyme, with peak effect occurring at 30 minutes, as reflected by increases of plasma renin activity (from 16.8 +/- 6 to 86.6 +/- 23 ng/ml/hour) and decreases of plasma aldosterone levels (from 46 +/- 14 to 25 +/- 6 ng%) (both p less than 0.05). With reduction of angiotensin II--mediated vasoconstriction, systemic vascular resistance decreased markedly (from 1,974 +/- 233 to 1,400 +/- 136 dyne s cm-5) and cardiac index was improved (from 1.88 +/- 0.9 to 2.20 +/- 0.21 liters/min/m2) (both p less than 0.05). The time course of angiotensin II levels suggested that the lack of a cumulative effect from additive doses of intravenous enalapril was a reflection of complete inhibition of converting enzyme. One patient did not respond to enalapril; despite comparable hemodynamic severity of CHF, the renin-angiotensin system was not activated in this patient. Thus, intravenous enalapril is capable of rapid and complete inhibition of converting enzyme for the accurate assessment of angiotensin II--mediated vasoconstriction in patients with severe CHF.", 
    "190": "A variety of N-substituted (mercaptoalkanoyl)- and [(acylthio)alkanoyl]glycine derivatives was synthesized and their ability in inhibiting the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was examined in vitro and in vivo. The acylthio derivatives prepared are assumed to act as prodrugs since they are much less active than the corresponding free SH compounds in vitro and can be expected to act in vivo only after conversion to the free sulfhydryl compounds. A number of these compounds are potent ACE inhibitors that lowered blood pressure in Na-deficient, conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a high renin model. One of the most active members of the series was (S)-N-cyclopentyl-N-[3-[(2,2-dimethyl-1-oxopropyl)thio]-2-methyl-1 -oxopropyl]glycine (REV 3659-(S), pivopril). Structure-activity relationships are discussed.", 
    "191": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II. The finding of angiotensin-converting enzyme in dexamethasone-stimulated cultured monocytes and alveolar macrophages prompted the examination of a human monocyte-like cell line (U937) for angiotensin I-converting activity. Conversion of angiotensin I (5 X 10(-5) mol/L) to angiotensin II by U937 cell extracts (10(4) - 4 X 10(6) cells) was detected, and the pH optimum for the reaction was 7.0 to 8.0. The U937 cell angiotensin I-converting activity was purified to homogeneity by carboxymethylcellulose chromatography and trasylol affinity chromatography. The purified protein performed similarly to purified human neutrophil cathepsin G on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-gradient PAGE), elicited a reaction of complete identity with neutrophil cathepsin G when diffused against anti-cathepsin G antiserum, and had quantitatively similar angiotensin I-converting activity as neutrophil cathepsin G. Neutrophils and U937 cells had 143 and 52 times greater angiotensin I-converting capability than cultured monocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting the relative importance of mobile cells containing cathepsin G in the local generation of angiotensin II. These data identify the angiotensin I-converting activity of the U937 cell as leukocyte cathepsin G and provide evidence that the U937 cell has neutrophil-like as well as monocyte-like characteristics.", 
    "192": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are effective vasodilators in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Enalapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or placebo, in addition to digoxin and diuretic drugs, were given to 17 patients with chronic congestive heart failure who were followed up for 12 weeks. In random double-blind fashion, nine patients received enalapril and eight received placebo. Cardiac dimensions and function improved slightly but insignificantly in both groups. Treadmill exercise duration increased from a mean value (+/- standard deviation) of 9.1 +/- 3.2 to 12.0 +/- 3.5 minutes during enalapril administration (p less than 0.025) and was unchanged during placebo administration (10.1 +/- 3.7 versus 11.1 +/- 5.2 minutes). Maximal oxygen consumption also increased during enalapril therapy (15.8 +/- 3.4 to 18.4 +/- 4.4 ml/min per kg, p less than 0.05) and remained unchanged during placebo treatment (16.0 +/- 6.4 versus 17.0 +/- 4.6 ml/min per kg). Clinical functional class (Yale scale) improved 3.1 +/- 1.9 points (p less than 0.01) during enalapril treatment but not during placebo treatment (0.8 +/- 3.5 points, no significant difference). No significant side effects were observed. Thus, enalapril appears to be a clinically effective and useful new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for the management of chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "193": "Reduction in arterial blood pressure caused by ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists and beta-blockers leads to regression of heart muscle hypertrophy. However, this regression may also occur in the absence of a significant reduction in blood pressure (alpha-Methyldopa), whereas no decrease in heart muscle mass may be observed in the presence of pronounced decreases in blood pressure (hydralazine, minoxidil, diuretics). In the present review, biochemical factors are analyzed that might be important in the regression of heart muscle hypertrophy. It will be seen that angiotensin II and cardiac catecholamines play important roles in modifying the influence of various drugs on regression of heart muscle hypertrophy. Reductions in angiotensin II and cardiac catecholamines lead to decreases in cardiac mRNA contents and thus to a decrease in the myocardial protein synthesis. Changes in myocardial protein degradation do not contribute to the regression of heart muscle hypertrophy.", 
    "194": "Major advances have taken place in recent years with respect to our understanding of hypertensive diseases, the mechanisms of action of other therapeutic agents, and the introduction of new classes of drugs. Standard therapy today uses the basic of employing nonpharmacological modalities. Thereafter a stepped-care program with pharmacological entities has been advocated using diuretic, antiadrenergic, and vasodilating agents. However, new modes of action have been introduced therapeutically during these years through inhibition of heretofore unexplored pressor mechanisms; some may be used monotherapeutically. Just precisely how the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs reduce arterial pressure still remains to be elucidated. We do not fully understand why the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors work in patients with hypertension who do not have high (or even suppressed) plasma renin activity, but they are effective. Clinical studies directed toward these questions as well as toward other new classes of antihypertensive agents (including how the calcium ion affects vascular smooth muscle contractility) should provide continued enlightenment as to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of essential hypertension. Moreover, knowledge of newer compounds that possess unique mechanisms of action should stimulate new thinking about this enigmatic disease of blood pressure regulation that we term 'essential hypertension' as well as more specific control of arterial pressure in this ubiquitous disease.", 
    "195": "We have shown that a number of compounds which inhibit the degradation of met-enkephalin can produce naloxone-reversible analgesia in mice. These compounds also potentiate the analgesia produced by acupuncture, foot shock, and transcutaneous nerve stimulation in animals and humans. The potency of their effectiveness as analgesics or potentiators parallels their potency as inhibitors of mouse brain enkephalinase. D-Phenylalanine (DPA), one of these enkephalinase inhibitors, has been used successfully for the management of chronic intractable pain in humans and to potentiate the treatment of many painful conditions by acupuncture. Other aspects of pharmacology of DPA will be discussed, including its effects on the cardio-vascular system, behavior, and lack of development of tolerance and dependence when used chronically in animals and humans.", 
    "196": "The effect of melanotropin release inhibiting factor (L-prolyl-L-leucyl-glycinamide, MIF) on blood pressure and heart rate of both spontaneously hypertensive (SH) and age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was investigated. A single s.c. injection of MIF at a lower dose (1 mg/kg) had no effect on the blood pressure of either SH or WKY rats when measured 1,4 and 7 hr after the injection of MIF. Higher doses of MIF (2 or 4 mg/kg), on the other hand, significantly depressed blood pressure in SH animals at 4 and 7 hr after the drug injection. However, MIF had no effect on the blood pressure of WKY rats. None of the doses of MIF had any appreciable effect on the heart rate of either SH or WKY rats. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of anterior pituitary of WKY rats was significantly higher than that of SH rats. ACE activity of neurohypophysis, however, was lower in WKY rats than in SH rats. No change in the ACE activities of central and peripheral tissues (plasma, pituitary, striatum and hypothalamus) of SH rats was observed 4 hr after the administration of MIF (1, 2 or 4 mg/kg), a time at which MIF produced significant antihypertensive effect. It is concluded that MIF causes a delayed lowering of blood pressure only in the genetically hypertensive rats and that this effect is not mediated via an action on the ACE.", 
    "197": "Multiclinic controlled studies have shown that enalapril alone 10 to 40 mg/day orally is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. Enalapril has been compared with thiazides and beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol). The effect on systolic blood pressure has been greater with enalapril than with beta-blockers. The proportion of patients who respond to enalapril alone with a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (greater than or equal to 10mm Hg) is around 70%. When a thiazide is added to the treatment, the proportion is above 90%. Enalapril improves the signs and symptoms associated with congestive heart failure. Patients increased their exercise tolerance by an average of 148 sec and improved in their NYHA cardiac status and prognosis classification. The overall incidence of side effects is similar to that seen in the placebo control groups. Side effects such as agranulocytosis, taste loss, rash, proteinuria were not characteristic of enalapril. This supports the hypothesis that the improved safety profile of enalapril is the result of being a nonsulphydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The most common side effects reported were dizziness, headache and asthenia. Abnormalities in electrolytes, uric acid, glucose or in lipids have generally not been associated with enalapril.", 
    "198": "Groups of 15 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis have been treated with sulphasalazine, (salazosulfapyridine INN), zinc sulfate, captopril or methyl cysteine, and assessed by seven clinical measurements and six laboratory methods on eight occasions during a 24-week treatment period. The results have been compared with equivalent data derived from the use of antiinflammatory agents (e.g. aspirin) and drugs of accepted 'antirheumatoid activity' (e.g. D-penicillamine). Improvements in mean data provide the basis of a human screening system for the detection of antirheumatoid drug activity. Results suggest that sulphasalazine and captopril have this type of activity whereas zinc sulfate and methyl cysteine do not.", 
    "199": "The acute response to ganglionic blockade (hexamethonium bromide, 30 mg/kg, i.v.) was used to evaluate the neurogenic contributions to mean arterial pressure maintenance in the conscious one-kidney, one clip hypertensive dog. Approximately 2 hours (112 minutes) after ganglionic blockade, captopril (10 mg/kg, i.v.) was given to block the renin-angiotensin system. Hypertensive animals were studied 3 days after clipping (group 2) or 2 to 4 weeks after clipping (groups 3 and 4). Groups 2 and 3 were fed a regular sodium diet, but group 4 animals were sodium and volume depleted. Normotensive control animals (group 1) were fed a regular sodium diet. On the day of the acute experiment the baseline blood pressures measured in group 2 (151 +/- 10 mm Hg, n = 5), group 3 (154 +/- 5 mm Hg, n = 7), and group 4 (160 +/- 8 mm Hg, n = 7) were not different (p greater than 0.05) from each other, but all were elevated (p less than 0.05) compared with the group 1 animals (106 +/- 3 mm Hg, n = 8). Also, there were no significant differences (p greater than 0.05) in the baseline plasma catecholamine levels among the three hypertensive groups. Ganglionic blockade produced a greater fall in blood pressure (p less than 0.05) in the sodium/volume-depleted dogs of group 4 (-35 mm Hg) than in group 1 (-10 mm Hg), group 2 (-3 mm Hg), or group 3 (-12 mm Hg) animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "200": "The pressor responses in the pithed rat to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists can be modified by alterations in arterial blood gas levels or by drugs which interfere with excitation-contraction coupling processes in the vascular smooth muscle, e.g. Ca2+-entry blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, the extent of these influences depends on which agonist is used. The pressor response to intravenous injection of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists consists of two phases: an initial rapid but transient response (phase I) is followed by a response of slower onset but longer duration (phase II). We have examined the effects of manipulation of arterial blood gases, a Ca2+-entry blocker, nifedipine, and an ACE inhibitor, teprotide, on the pressor responses to a series of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists. In each case, the effects showed selectivity for one or other of the two phases and the differences in susceptibility between agonists could be explained by the relative sizes of the two phases in their responses. In general, phase II was more susceptible to alkalosis, nifedipine and teprotide, so that drugs in which this component predominated were more susceptible to these factors. In contrast there was no direct correlation with the receptor subtypes activated by the agonists.", 
    "201": "Captopril was first administered to hypertensive patients 7 years ago. The relatively high dosage employed and the severity of diseases in the patient population initially led to a high frequency of side effects. Subsequently, an increase in the time intervals for dose titration and the earlier addition of a diuretic have made it possible to reduce the daily dose, thus significantly improving the drug's safety profile without compromising its antihypertensive effect. In a worldwide postmarketing surveillance study of captopril, 6,737 hypertensive patients were enrolled, of whom 3,219 were treated for at least 1 year. Patients had a mean entry blood pressure of 183 (+/- 31)/111 (+/- 16) mm Hg while still receiving an average of 2.3 antihypertensive drugs. However, 10.3% were not receiving therapy before entering the study. 1,811 patients (29% of those for whom relevant data were available) had impaired renal function on entry (serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 1.6 mg/dl). The hypertension of 881 of the patients (13.1%) was classified as mild to moderate. By design, the types of patients, dosage schedules, and patient monitoring requirements were consistent with the recommendations of the manufacturer at the time the study was initiated. The results of the study showed that long-term antihypertensive efficacy was maintained with a mean captopril dose of approximately 150 mg/day, when used either as monotherapy or more frequently with a diuretic. This dosage was associated with satisfactory control of blood pressure and a considerable reduction in the 12 months' cumulative frequency of drug discontinuation because of adverse reactions (5.8%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "202": "Nifedipine, in a slow release preparation, was given at a mean daily dosage of 47 +/- 4 mg to 12 patients with severe hypertension in whom arterial pressure was not satisfactorily controlled (mean arterial pressure 132 +/- 4 4 mm Hg) by the combination of a converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. The addition of nifedipine induced an appreciable decrease in mean arterial pressure of 31 +/- 5 mm Hg and of serum potassium and plasma aldosterone. After adequate control of hypertension and because of severe hypokalemia in some patients, discontinuation of the diuretic was attempted in 10 subjects. After 1.7 +/- 0.5 months of treatment by the converting enzyme inhibitor and nifedipine no change in arterial pressure occurred while serum potassium had returned to normal in most patients. These results show that nifedipine may be useful in patients with a residual rise of arterial pressure when treated by converting enzyme inhibitor plus diuretics; in such patients, however, the serum potassium concentration should be carefully monitored. In addition, our observations suggest that calcium blockers may be an effective alternative to diuretics in patients receiving a converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "203": "The antihypertensive efficacy of combination therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and a diuretic or a calcium antagonist was compared in 16 patients with essential hypertension with a blood pressure of over 160/95 mm Hg having triple drug therapy. While monotherapy with a calcium antagonist--usually verapamil 500 mg/day or nitrendipine 70 mg/day--did not reduce diastolic blood pressure to greater than 95 mm Hg, this goal was achieved in 15 out of 16 patients with the combination of captopril (53 mg/day) and the calcium antagonists in the above dose (151 +/- 4/88 +/- 2 SEM mm Hg) and in 13 out of 16 patients with captopril (84 mg/day) and a diuretic (158 +/- 4/91 +/- 1 mm Hg). There was a direct relationship between intraindividual pressure responses to the two drug combinations (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). Heart rate was similar and weight lower on the captopril-diuretic combination. Captopril's antihypertensive efficacy can be equally enhanced by calcium antagonists (without affecting renin long term) as by diuretics, which are thought to work by stimulating the renin-angiotensin system. The calcium antagonist-captopril combination may be of particular advantage in hypertensive patients who are otherwise difficult to treat.", 
    "204": "Because captopril alone does not control blood pressure in all patients with essential hypertension, studies were performed to assess the effect of sodium intake and of captopril combined with hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, and nifedipine. Captopril given for 5 days to normotensive subjects having high, normal, and low sodium intakes reduced blood pressure the most in those on the lowest intake; the fall correlated with that in plasma angiotensin II. When 12 patients with moderate hypertension had hydrochlorothiazide added to captopril their blood pressure fell significantly. When propranolol was added to captopril, however, there was no further fall in blood pressure. When propranolol was added to captopril and a diuretic, pressures measured 4 and 6 h after the last dose of captopril showed reduced values compared with placebo; pressures measured 2 and 12 h after did not. Nifedipine added to captopril reduced blood pressure more than either drug alone. When renin and angiotensin are low, as they may be in essential hypertension, captopril is less effective; its effectiveness should increase if sodium is restricted. Both diuretics and nifedipine increase the effectiveness of captopril; propranolol does not, although it may prolong captopril's action. Experience in patients with resistant hypertension suggests that adding nifedipine to captopril may reduce the need for diuretics, while adding captopril to nifedipine may reduce the need for beta-blockers.", 
    "205": "A total of 270 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were evaluated in a multicenter double-blind randomized study that compared the effect of captopril plus a thiazide diuretic with that of propranolol plus a diuretic. All patients were previously uncontrolled with diuretics alone. Following a 4-week placebo control period, during which diuretic was not withdrawn, the patients were treated either with 37.5-75 mg/day of captopril (n = 133) or with 60-120 mg/day of propranolol (n = 137) for 12 weeks, the diuretic being continued in both groups. Blood pressure in both groups was significantly reduced after 2 weeks of treatment. Reduction in systolic but not diastolic blood pressure after 10 and 12 weeks of treatment was significantly greater in the captopril group than in the propranolol group (p less than 0.05). Treatment was considered to be effective in 77% of the captopril patients and in 61% of the propranolol group. The difference was significant (p less than 0.05). Side effects occurred in 6 of the 133 patients (4.5%) treated with captopril and in 16 of the 137 patients (11.7%) treated with propranolol. The difference between the two groups was significant (p less than 0.05). There were few significant changes in laboratory data in either group. The serious side effects previously reported with higher doses of captopril were not observed. The results indicate that low-dose captopril plus a diuretic is more efficacious than propranolol plus a diuretic in mild to moderate essential hypertension previously uncontrolled with a diuretic alone.", 
    "206": "The effects of long-term treatment with differing dosages of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide in combination were evaluated in 22 hypertensive patients. There was no significant difference in antihypertensive efficacy between captopril 25 mg twice a day in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once or twice daily and captopril 50 mg twice a day in the same combination. About 75% of patients achieved normotension. Once daily therapy with captopril 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg was effective in only 25% of patients. Long-term treatment (11 months) with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide did not cause any of the metabolic effects usually observed during diuretic administration. Intracellular (lymphocytic) Na+ was significantly reduced and intracellular K+ significantly increased by captopril and hydrochlorothiazide, and this led to the normalization of the intracellular Na+:K+ ratio, which is abnormally high in essential hypertension. Our data suggest that the association of low doses of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide is highly effective, well tolerated, prevents the metabolic side effects of diuretics, and has favorable effects on intracellular ionic composition.", 
    "207": "The severe side effects uncommonly seen with captopril seem to be associated with high doses and/or compromised patients. A very flat dose-response curve in high dosages and the expectation of fewer side effects made us combine low-dose captopril with enhanced stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system. Methods used were as follows: (a) In 43 patients (25 female, 18 male, age 45 +/- 10) with inadequate lowering of blood pressure or side effects due to therapy, we started a combination therapy with the fixed combination of captopril 25 mg + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg twice a day after a washout phase of 14 days. If blood pressure was not lowered satisfactorily, we increased the dosage to a fixed combination of 50 mg captopril + 25 mg HCTZ for 6 months. (b) In 12 patients (eight male, four female, age 47 +/- 7) an initial high-dose treatment of captopril (3 X 50-3 X 150 mg, mean = 325 +/- 87 mg/day in combination with small doses of diuretics) was changed to low-dose captopril (2 X 50 mg, mean = 96 +/- 14 mg/day; dose reduction: 70%!) in a fixed combination with 25 mg HCTZ in each tablet. Results obtained were as follows: (a) Initial blood pressure values of 189/106 +/- 28/7 mm Hg fell to 160/84 +/- 23/12 mm Hg after 2 weeks. Systolic pressure decreased further to 146 +/- 20 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "208": "The effects of single doses of captopril 100 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, and a combination of both on 24-h outputs of fluid and several solutes were compared in healthy volunteers. Thirteen subjects were studied in a metabolic ward under strictly controlled conditions. Single doses of placebo, captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and a combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide were given double-blind in random order on 4 separate days. Urine was collected at regular intervals for 24 h after medication. The combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide alone significantly increased the 24-h urinary outputs of Cl-, Na+, fluid, and K+ compared with placebo and also accelerated the corresponding urinary flows. Captopril did not change the 24-h urinary excretions of Cl-, Na+, fluid, and K+ significantly, though it advanced the time courses of their urinary flows. All medications significantly increased the 24-h renal outputs of Mg2+ and creatinine. Captopril significantly increased the 24-h urinary output of urate and advanced its urinary flow. Hydrochlorothiazide significantly decreased the output and retarded the flow. The combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide did not change the 24-h urinary output and retarded its flow. It is concluded that the renal excretory actions of captopril are more prolonged than the plasma levels of the drug would indicate. Captopril has diuretic effects which may vary in potency with aldosterone concentrations and uricosuric properties unrelated to aldosterone status.", 
    "209": "Mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients (255) were assigned to receive hydrochlorothiazide 15 mg three times a day, captopril 25 mg three times a day, or both. A significant decline in blood pressure was seen in 84% of patients taking both agents, while 43% of those taking captopril and 64% of those taking hydrochlorothiazide showed a significant blood pressure response. Among white hypertensives receiving captopril alone, a normalization of blood pressure occurred in 46% and a significant reduction in 8% was observed which was significantly (p less than 0.05) higher than that observed in black subjects where only 31% showed a normalization of their pressure with captopril alone. With hydrochlorothiazide, 53% of blacks and 54% of whites showed normalization of their pressures. With the combination, over 80% of the patients in both racial groups demonstrated a normalization or significant reduction in blood pressure. With hydrochlorothiazide alone, significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in serum potassium, increases in uric acid, blood glucose, and blood cholesterol were seen. With captopril alone, no changes in any of these measurements were observed. When captopril was added to hydrochlorothiazide, a significant attenuation of the diuretic effect on potassium and uric acid was observed, and the significant change in blood sugar and cholesterol seen with the diuretic alone was prevented. These observations suggest that there are heterogeneous responses to hypertensive monotherapy based on race. Furthermore, it suggests that when a single therapeutic agent is not adequate in controlling blood pressure to the desired levels, the addition of either hydrochlorothiazide or captopril should produce a further reduction in blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "210": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on large arteries have been examined in uncomplicated essential hypertensive patients (grade 1-2 WHO). These effects were determined from (a) changes in arterial compliance as measured from the slope of the decline in arterial pressure during diastole and (b) alterations in diameter of the brachial artery and blood flow velocity within its lumen, as assessed by pulsed Doppler velocimetry. Both acute and chronic ACE inhibition were accompanied by a significant increase in arterial compliance and a dilation of the brachial artery. This response might be related to changes in plasma and/or intraarterial angiotensin and/or to changes in plasma potassium. Whatever their mechanism, the arterial dilatation and increase in compliance would improve the buffering and the conducting functions of the large arteries, and these in turn may, if persistent, prove beneficial in possibly preventing arterial complications of hypertension.", 
    "211": "Compelling arguments can be made for a local, intrarenal role as angiotensin's first action in phylogeny, with additional cardiovascular and endocrine responses arising later. Perhaps for that reason the vascular bed of the kidney is especially responsive to angiotensin II. Conversely, when the renin-angiotensin system is activated, as it is when sodium intake is restricted or diuretics are administered, the renal blood supply shows the most striking and consistent vasodilatation among vascular beds assessed after converting enzyme inhibition. When renal vascular tone is increased in patients with essential hypertension, converting enzyme inhibitors induce a potentiated acute renal vascular response: renal blood flow increases more than it does in normal subjects, with an associated consistent early increase in sodium excretion and an occasional increase in glomerular filtration rate. Reduced aldosterone release consequent on the block of angiotensin II formation also contributes to the natriuresis and results in positive potassium balance. With long-term therapy renal function tends to be well maintained. The response to converting enzyme inhibition in renal artery stenosis is more complex: as perfusion pressure distal to the stenosis falls there is typical afferent arteriolar dilatation and glomerular capillary pressure tends to be maintained by a rise in postglomerular resistance. To the extent that this is angiotensin mediated, suppression of angiotensin formation can reduce glomerular capillary pressure and thus filtration rate. This is well tolerated in the patient with unilateral stenosis and a healthy contralateral kidney, but can provoke renal failure where the stenosis is bilateral or involves a solitary kidney.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "212": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are vasodilators that exert their beneficial hemodynamic effects in hypertension primarily by withdrawal of the vasoconstricting action of endogenous angiotension II. Although the magnitude of the initial decrease in vascular resistance depends on renin activity, the long-term arterial blood pressure response does not appear to be influenced by initial renin levels. Cardiac output is not significantly altered by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, but a rise toward normal levels often occurs in patients with severe hypertension or heart failure. Although right and left heart filling pressures are not significantly altered, other evidence suggests that these agents increase venous capacitance. Patients with severe hypertension, for example, have shown increased forearm venous distensibility in response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and a decrease in the ratio of cardiopulmonary blood volume to total blood volume has been demonstrated in normotensive patients with heart failure. Several studies have shown improved renal blood flow after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, suggesting that renal vascular resistance is reduced more than systemic resistance. Reflex tachycardia and other neurohumoral counterregulatory responses occur less frequently than with other vasodilators, because neither the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone nor the autonomic nervous system is activated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "213": "After a brief introduction summarizing their historical development and the classification of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors by chemical structure, the considerations involved in developing new and improved drugs of this pharmacologic class are discussed. These include properties such as the drug's potency, route of absorption and excretion, pharmacokinetics, drug disposition, and toxicity. Although increased potency, a traditional method for improving efficacy, can be achieved with angiotensin-converting inhibitors by introducing additional binding sites or by increasing the strength of binding at existing sites, safety testing has shown that with some compounds this approach may cause nephrotoxicity. Because renal disease is a common cause of hypertension and the two conditions frequently coexist, in some patients agents that are eliminated by both renal and hepatobiliary routes may be more desirable than those eliminated almost exclusively by the kidneys, such as captopril. This and other shortcomings of captopril have led to the development of two new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, zofenopril and fosfenopril, which are both in the early phase of clinical investigation. The former is an analog of captopril and the latter is classified as a first phosphinic acid angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Another possibility for the future is the incorporation of two therapeutic objectives into a single compound in the form of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory diuretic which, although chemically feasible, may be of questionable practical value. Also, the success of blood pressure control through intervention at the level of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has created interest in the development of renin inhibitors. The primary stimulus for this avenue of investigation was the specificity of renin, which has only one substrate while converting enzyme has many.", 
    "214": "To determine if food reduces the hemodynamic and humoral effects of captopril in patients with essential hypertension, we performed two studies. In the acute study, 15 inpatients with uncomplicated essential hypertension randomly received a single oral dose of placebo or captopril (25 mg) while fasting or after eating, or captopril (50 mg) after eating. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 30 min up to 4 h (and up to 10 h in six out of the 15 patients), while plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme were measured 2 h after dosing. Compared with placebo, captopril significantly reduced mean blood pressure (p less than 0.001), serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (p less than 0.005), and aldosterone (p less than 0.001), increased plasma renin activity (p less than 0.05), and did not change heart rate; there was no difference between the fasting and the fed state. In the six patients followed up to 10 h, captopril both before and after food significantly and similarly reduced mean blood pressure up to 8 h (p less than or equal to 0.05). In the chronic study, 10 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension, while having prolonged (3-12 months) treatment with captopril (50 mg twice a day), were asked to take captopril for 1 month 1 h before eating and for another month during or immediately after eating. The sequence was randomized, and blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, and plasma aldosterone were measured at the end of each period 12 h after last dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "215": "Nine patients with essential hypertension treated with bendroflumethiazide were given captopril 25 mg orally on three occasions to study the pharmacokinetics and blood pressure effects. Study 1: acute and fasting; study 2 and 3: with and without concomitant food intake (randomized order) after chronic treatment with captopril 25 mg three times a day for 4-5 weeks. Total and non-protein-bound captopril were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) was lower during chronic treatment. MAP reduction was slightly more pronounced initially with concomitant food intake but thereafter the reductions were similar for up to 12 h in the three studies. Mean values for maximal MAP reductions and peak plasma concentrations of captopril occurred at the same time, but individual values were not correlated with each other. Peak plasma concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) of total and non-protein-bound captopril were slightly reduced with concomitant food intake. Chronic treatment did not consistently change the kinetics except for a slight prolongation of terminal half-life of non-protein-bound captopril. The AUC was higher during the chronic studies, probably owing to the baseline presence of captopril in plasma. It appears that captopril can be given twice daily and together with food without loss of blood pressure control in essential hypertension.", 
    "216": "Since the end of 1976 ten orally active converting enzyme inhibitors [SQ 14,225 (captopril), MK 421 (enalapril), MK 422, MK 521 (lysinopril), RHC 3659, CGS 13945, CGS 13928C, CGS 14824A, Hoe 498, S 9490-3, and Ro 31-2848] have been evaluated by our group in normal volunteers. Their ability to blunt the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I and their effect on the different components of the renin-angiotensin system were tested. This approach has made it possible to establish the efficacy of the different molecules and to predict with a considerable degree of accuracy onset and duration of action of the various compounds as well as the doses needed to treat hypertensive patients. All ten molecules were effective in blocking converting enzyme and thereby the pressor response to angiotensin I. Potency and time course of the inhibition varied considerably among the compounds. Thus, a number of highly effective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are actually in clinical evaluation and several of them should become available for general clinical use within a few years.", 
    "217": "The usual regimens of captopril--twice or thrice daily administration--are based on the duration of the decrease in plasma angiotensin II induced by captopril. In a study performed to evaluate the hypotensive effect of once daily captopril, 13 white patients with mild-to-severe uncomplicated hypertension were treated with one tablet of captopril 100 mg daily, taken 1-1.5 h before lunch, for 8 weeks. Arterial blood pressure was measured weekly, 22-23.5 h after medication. The patients' diet contained no more than 120 mmol/day of sodium. In the first week supine blood pressure fell from 210 +/- 3/128 +/- 4 (mean +/- SEM) to 179 +/- 5/116 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001/p less than 0.01 compared with pretreatment). After the large decrease in the first week changes in systolic and diastolic pressures tailed off; they tended to fall towards stable values that would be maintained on prolonged treatment. At the end of the eighth week the supine values were 155 +/- 3/104 +/- 3 (p less than 0.001/p less than 0.001). Changes in erect blood pressure paralleled those in the supine posture. No side effects were detected. These results confirm that captopril is efficacious when given alone to patients with essential hypertension who are taking a low sodium diet. Blood pressures were not, however, reduced to normotensive levels. Captopril's hypotensive effect in once daily administration appears to be independent of its effects on circulating angiotensin II. Captopril alone 100 mg/day is thus indicated in essential hypertension and should be prescribed once daily to obtain the best possible compliance.", 
    "218": "Diuretics have so far enjoyed a prominent position in all stepped-care programs, as the preferred first choice drug in most American schemes or as an alternative first choice drug with respect to beta-blockers in the WHO scheme. Among various reasons for this prominence has been that antihypertensive drugs available until recently all gradually led to sodium and water retention, and therefore required to be combined with a diuretic. This is no longer true: several antihypertensive agents are available now that do not require combination with diuretics, these new agents including not only beta-blockers but also angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium entry blockers. Furthermore, some concern about the metabolic effects of diuretics has recently been raised, especially because of the failure to prevent coronary heart disease by the current diuretic-based antihypertensive regimens. Without denying the importance that diuretics have had in the past in making antihypertensive therapy successful and their continuing essential role in treating severe hypertension, it is likely, in my opinion, that in future years diuretics are going to be more often used as agents of second choice, mostly in combination with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and, perhaps, some of the calcium blockers. In conclusion, although opinions of various experts about the sequence of choices between antihypertensive drugs may obviously differ, there is no doubt that the addition of new classes of effective agents, such as the ACE inhibitors and the calcium entry blockers, is making antihypertensive therapy more flexible and more easily suitable to the needs of individual patients.", 
    "219": "The antihypertensive effects of captopril and enalapril maleate were studied over a 10-week period in 24 hypertensive patients randomized into captopril or enalapril treatment groups. Prestudy blood pressure was 171 +/- 4/109 +/- 1 mm Hg and after 4 weeks of hydrochlorothiazide 160 +/- 4/103 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05). With the addition of converting enzyme inhibitor to hydrochlorothiazide the blood pressure decreased at 3 h to 132 +/- 3/87 +/- 2 in the subjects. The diastolic blood pressure decreased acutely more with captopril (-24) than with enalapril (-17) (p less than 0.05). After 10 weeks of combined therapy the depressor response was maintained (134 +/- 3/83 +/- 1) and there was no difference between the diastolic blood pressure in the two groups treated with captopril and enalapril. Acute and chronic responses of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and converting enzyme to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were determined. There was a significant correlation between the acute fall in diastolic blood pressure and rise in plasma renin activity in patients treated with captopril but not with enalapril. In conclusion, there is an acute depressor response with converting enzyme inhibition which is more pronounced with captopril than with enalapril and which correlates with an increase in plasma renin activity. With more prolonged treatment, the two drugs show equivalent efficacy in reducing blood pressure, inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme, reducing aldosterone, and stimulating plasma renin activity.", 
    "220": "In any therapeutic situation, the choice of drug therapy depends on an estimation of relative risk and benefit. With respect to moderate hypertension, and with less certainty, mild hypertension, the use of drug therapy has resulted in a decrease in overall mortality, a decrease in the incidence of stroke and renal impairment, but little or no change in the incidence of ischemic heart disease. For several years, the choice of first drug in these situations has rested between thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. There is probably little to choose between these two groups in terms of efficacy, and equally there is little evidence that patient response to one or other agents can be predicted either on demographic or biochemical evidence. There are, however, several studies both in Africa and America suggesting that black patients have a relatively greater hypotensive response to thiazides than to beta-blockers. The adverse reaction profile of these two groups is quite different. There is currently much debate whether the administration of large doses of thiazide diuretics (for example, 10 mg bendrofluazide per day) may cause a constellation of metabolic side effects (hyperlipemia, hypokalemia, abnormal glucose tolerance, and hyperuricemia) which may result in an increase of the risk of developing coronary artery disease in spite of lowering blood pressure. Further, there is no good evidence that the hypotensive effect of diuretics is dose dependent. On the other hand, the evidence that beta-blockers when used as antihypertensive agents have a primary preventive effect for ischemic heart disease is currently very small.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "221": "An important consideration in the choice of initial treatment is race. In a Veterans Administration study nadolol reduced blood pressure more in whites than in blacks, while the reverse was true with hydrochlorothiazide. Combining both drugs enhanced antihypertensive effectiveness and abolished the racial difference. The results of this and other studies suggest that for first drug selection, beta-blockers are indicated in whites and diuretics in blacks. Beta-blockers are also indicated in all patients with prior myocardial infarction or with tachycardia. Thiazides are also used in combination with other antihypertensive drugs and in patients with heart failure. Reluctance to use thiazide diuretics stems from the possibility of hypokalemia-induced arrhythmias and long-term elevations of serum cholesterol. However, a causal relationship between hypokalemia and the incidence of arrhythmias is not well supported by physiologic or clinical evidence. Elevation of cholesterol appears to be transient, reverting back to pretreatment levels after 6-12 months of treatment. An alternative regimen which is both highly effective and well tolerated is the combination of small doses of both a thiazide diuretic and captopril. Perhaps less well tolerated, but useful where cost is the major consideration, is a thiazide followed by small doses of reserpine, if needed; this is an effective, low-cost treatment. Calcium channel blockers appear promising but require further evaluation.", 
    "222": "Inhibition of angiotensin II generation in the plasma does not fully explain the antihypertensive effects of converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors. Thus, we investigated the role of CE inhibition in the tissue for the antihypertensive action of these drugs. After discontinuation of 4 weeks of oral treatment with either Hoe498 (3 mg/kg/day) or MK421 (30 mg/kg/day) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP), the reduced pressor response to intravenous angiotensin I was normalized within 1 day, although systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained decreased during a 1 week post-treatment follow-up period. Two weeks of oral treatment with Hoe498 (1 mg/kg/day) and MK421 (30 mg/kg/day) in SHRSP lowered blood pressure markedly and inhibited CE in the plasma (43% and 22%), lung (85% and 33%), kidney (76% and 76%), aortic wall (75% and 48%), and (with Hoe498) in the heart (55%). After drug discontinuation, blood pressure remained decreased for an additional 2 weeks, whereas plasma CE was normal or elevated during the follow-up period. However, tissue CE activity measured 1 week after drug withdrawal was still inhibited in the aortic wall (67% and 30%) and in the kidney (48% and 41%). These results support the hypothesis that the prolonged antihypertensive action of CE inhibitors may be related to persistent CE inhibition in tissues such as vascular wall and kidney. Further, the data support the importance of CE inhibition at target sites other than plasma and lung vascular endothelium.", 
    "223": "Intravenous infusion of SA-446 (1 mg/min) decreased systemic blood pressure and increased renal blood flow in anesthetized dogs. These changes were accompanied by a slight natriuretic response. During the infusion of this dose of SA-446, the pressor response to angiotensin I was abolished and the depressor response to bradykinin was markedly potentiated. Administration of indomethacin (13 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed natriuresis and, to some extent, the renal vasodilation caused by SA-446. Before and after administration of SA-446, four arachidonate metabolites, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and thromboxane B2, were determined in plasma and urine by radioimmunoassay. There were no remarkable changes in levels of prostaglandins and thromboxane B2 in arterial and renal venous plasma. The urinary excretion of the metabolites varied little, but thromboxane B2 excretion did significantly decrease. Thus, reduction in the biosynthesis of thromboxane B2 in the kidney may relate to the effects of SA-446 on renal hemodynamics and urine formation.", 
    "224": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of the renin-angiotensin and the sympathetic nervous systems during the chronic phase (greater than 16 weeks) of two-kidney, one-clip hypertension in conscious unrestrained rats. During this phase, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p less than 0.001) and plasma angiotensin II (31.9 +/- 1.5 to 125.8 +/- 19.9 pg/ml, p less than 0.005) were significantly increased as compared to normotensive group. Converting enzyme inhibition by captopril produced a significant decrease of MAP (181.2 +/- 8.2 to 140.0 +/- 5.5 mmHg, p less than 0.001). This hypotensive response was similar when aprotinin (a Kallikrein inhibitor) and captopril were infused simultaneously. Alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blockade by phenoxybenzamine (POB) significantly decreased but did not normalize MAP (179.8 +/- 12.4 to 135.8 +/- 10.4 mmHg, p less than 0.001). However, when infused after POB, captopril induced a further decrease of MAP to 86.7 +/- 9.4 mmHg (p less than 0.001). This MAP level was not different from that found in normotensive rats after infusion of the two drugs (83.2 +/- 5.3 mmHg). These results suggest that both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system, by activating peripheral alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, maintain the high blood pressure during the chronic phase (greater than 16 weeks) of two-kidney, one-clip hypertension in conscious rats.",

    "226": "The present investigation sought to examine the importance of substance P in the altered respiratory activity after neonatal capsaicin administration. Halothane-anesthetized adult rats given capsaicin neonatally exhibit a decreased basal minute ventilation with PaCO2 equal to and PaO2 greater than vehicle injected controls. In addition, the minute ventilation-PaCO2 curve was displaced to the right. Acute bilateral cervical vagotomy severely blunted the minute ventilation response to PaCO2 and abolished the differences in ventilation between capsaicin treated and control rats. Neonatal capsaicin significantly reduced pons-medulla substance P content but not TRH, serotonin or 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that substance P fibers of the trigeminal spinal nucleus were the most severely affected in the brain stem and that substance P fibers in the lung were totally absent. The intracerebroventricular administration of substance P increased minute ventilation similarly in both control and capsaicin treated rats, largely as a result of increases in tidal volume. The minute ventilation-PaCO2 curve was similar in both groups after substance P administration. Simultaneous administration of the peptidase inhibitor captopril with substance P increased the respiratory response to substance P in normal rats. Administration of captopril to capsaicin treated rats restored the ventilation-PaCO2 curve to the position observed in normal rats. The hypotensive response to intracerebroventricular captopril alone in control rats was less profound in rats given neonatal capsaicin. These results are consistent with the thesis that respiratory depression after capsaicin treatment is at least in part due to the loss of substance P primary afferent nerve terminals in the brain stem, suggesting that substance P fibers in the brain stem may participate in the normal modulation of respiratory activity.", 
    "227": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can be recommended in the treatment of severe cardiac failure (New York Heart Association Functional Class III or VI) where they are probably superior to other vasodilators. Their use should be considered when routine therapy with diuretics and digoxin has failed to ameliorate symptoms. Whether they can be recommended also for mild heart failure and whether the benefits outweigh any risks associated with long-term blockade of the renin-angiotensin system are questions that remain to be answered. Their use in hypertension and early in acute myocardial infarction might prevent the development of heart failure, but appropriate studies in man are awaited.", 
    "228": "Captopril given for 5 days to normotensive subjects caused a significant fall in blood pressure. The fall in blood pressure was greater on a low sodium diet (19.6%) and less on a high sodium diet (11%) whereas on a normal sodium intake it was 16.5%. This fall in blood pressure was related to the initial level of angiotensin II and the fall in angiotensin II and was also associated with large falls in plasma aldosterone and, on the normal sodium intake, a loss of sodium that amounted to approximately 140 mmol/normal subject studied over the 5 days. Patients with essential hypertension who were studied on their normal diets had a similar fall in blood pressure for a given plasma renin activity. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are therefore used in hypertension not because they are specific for patients with high blood pressure but because they are effective in lowering blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects and cause few side effects. They are also particularly effective when used in conjunction with sodium restriction, diuretics, or calcium entry antagonists but less effective when combined with a beta-blocker.", 
    "229": "The acute, 60 min blood pressure and plasma renin responses to an oral test dose of captopril given to a quietly seated patient can be used to gain information quickly on renin dependency or lack of it in a hypertensive situation. This information is verified by a baseline renin sodium profile test. These two diagnostic steps define either renin dependency or a sodium-volume mechanism involved in the vasoconstrictor. At the same time they also enable the complete diagnosis or exclusion of curable renovascular disease. For long-term therapy, pharmacologic inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system can be accomplished by or using converting enzyme inhibitors to block angiotensin II formation or beta receptor blocking drugs to block renin secretion and by combining the two. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is the logical first step in antihypertensive drug therapy, both for acute hypertensive emergencies or chronic therapy, whenever the hypertension is largely or significantly renin dependent, i.e., in the high and normal renin forms of hypertension. This includes up to 70% of patients with essential hypertension. If converting enzyme inhibition or beta blockade is only partially effective, the two can be combined to achieve more complete blockade. A more popular alternative to this has been the addition of a diuretic as the second drug. However, this introduces well-known problems of diuretic therapy including dehydration, which eliminates the conceptual advantage of pure blockade of renin-mediated vasoconstriction, i.e., reducing pressure without reducing tissue flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "230": "The acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has been made it possible to investigate its role in the maintenance of blood pressure and aldosterone secretion in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The administration of saralasin or captopril and, in the near future, of renin inhibitors induces a fall in blood pressure that is variable from one subject to the other according to the sodium balance and the level of activation of the system. These blockers also decrease the angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone production and increase renin secretion according to the circulating level of angiotensin II and the functional state of adrenal and juxtaglomerular receptors. In practice the definition of an abnormal response to renin-angiotensin blockade is difficult to define precisely, but the hypotensive effect has been tentatively used for the diagnosis of renin-dependent hypertension, especially renovascular hypertension and primary hyperaldosteronism. In renal artery stenosis the most convincing results mainly concern the lateralization of an abnormal unilateral renin secretion, which is potentiated by an acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. The acute administration of converting enzyme inhibitor is also useful to detect the absence of decrease in plasma aldosterone, which is characteristic of a solitary tumor or of other anatomical and functional disorders of the adrenal glands.", 
    "231": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were developed to prevent the in vivo generation of angiotensin II and thereby to reduce peripheral vasoconstriction. However, these compounds exert some additional effects that may or may not be angiotensin dependent. These include potential sodium diuresis, bradykinin accumulation, prostaglandin release, blunting of sympathetic activity, parasympathomimetic actions, central effects, redistribution of blood flow toward some particularly important organs. Only the comprehensive assessment of the many complex interactions that exist between the renin-angiotensin and several other regulatory systems reveals the complete therapeutic profile of this class of pharmacologic agents.", 
    "232": "Angiotension II is the effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, agents directed at the receptor that mediates its actions are likely to represent the most physiologically specific inhibitors of the system. We suggest here an approach to such drugs based on an operational analogy between peptidases and peptide hormone receptors and on the development of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rationale that led to captopril, enalapril, and related inhibitors of this peptidase required identification of its cognitive and functional properties, i.e., what amino acid sequences it preferentially recognizes and its Zn2+ -dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity. Purification of the enzyme was necessary to obtain this information. We speculate that this type of information may be equally useful for developing a receptor antagonist. As progress toward this objective, we describe briefly purification of rabbit hepatic angiotensin II receptor using chemical and immunoaffinity ligands. We hope to determine the cognitive and functional properties of this purified protein, i.e., what residues it preferentially recognizes in defined peptides and the molecular mechanism by which binding of ligand is transduced into a cellular response.", 
    "233": "The hypotensive effects of inhibitors of renin or converting-enzyme (CE) were compared in normotensive sodium-depleted marmosets. Renin was inhibited by an antiserum or a monoclonal antibody against human kidney renin or by peptidic renin inhibitors. The fall in blood pressure after the administration of renin antibodies or inhibitors was accompanied by complete inhibition of plasma renin activity. Antiserum and monoclonal antibody induced a hypotensive response of similar magnitude as peptidic renin inhibitors but had a longer duration of action. Teprotide was used as a CE-inhibitor. Inhibition of renin or CE lowered blood pressure but did not affect heart rate. The magnitude of the hypotensive effect was comparable after renin- or CE-inhibition and depended on the pretreatment plasma renin activity. Inhibition of renin prevented the hypotensive response to inhibition of CE and vice versa. The results of these comparative studies suggest that, in states of sodium depletion, the acute hypotensive effects of renin- or CE-inhibitors are entirely due to their interference with the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "234": "The most important aspect of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in hypertension is the change that occurs in CBF autoregulation: increased cerebrovascular resistance causes the lower and upper limits of CBF autoregulation to be at higher pressure levels. The mechanism seems to be mainly structural thickening and luminal narrowing of cerebral resistance vessels. These adaptive changes, while protecting the brain against high intravascular pressure, render the brain more susceptible to ischemia at low blood pressure. An obvious consequence of the shift in the lower limit of CBF autoregulation in hypertension is that if the hypertensive patient's blood pressure is lowered acutely to \"normal\" levels, the pressure is below the patient's lower limit of autoregulation and ischemic damage may result. Basically, antihypertensive drugs can be placed into four groups as regards their effects on the cerebral circulation. First are the drugs without any direct effect: in this case, CBF remains constant until pressure reaches the lower limit of autoregulation and then decreases with any further pressure decrease. Diazoxide is in this category. Second are the drugs that directly dilate the small resistance levels in such a way that CBF is higher than normal at every pressure including pressures below the lower limit of autoregulation. However, perfusion may be uneven and autoregulation may be lost; an example of this kind of drug is dihydralazine. Third are the drugs which by alpha-or ganglion-blockade prevent the sympathetic vasoconstriction of large cerebral arteries (pial and larger), which can compromise CBF during a fall in blood pressure and hence shift the lower limit of autoregulation to a higher pressure than during blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "235": "The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has important effects on different parameters of left ventricular function. Chronic inhibition of the RAS avoids hypokalemia and potassium losses by increasing aldosterone release. This potassium-sparing effect is likely to prevent cardiac arrhythmia. Inhibition of the RAS reverses cardiac hypertrophy in renovascular and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), but not in DOCA salt hypertensive rats. Inhibition of the RAS also reverses the decrease in myocardial contractility, as demonstrated by the reversion of isoenzyme profile of cardiac myosin in renovascular hypertensive rats. In DOCA salt hypertensive rats, RAS inhibition has no effect on blood pressure or on cardiac contractility. Despite its peripheral vasodilatory property, inhibition of the RAS does not increase heart rate in relation to a direct negative chronotropic effect of angiotensin II inhibition and to the absence of activation of the baroreflex system. When RAS is activated, its inhibition has a coronary vasodilatory effect, but this coronary vasodilation is associated with a decrease in perfusion pressure and with an increase in intrinsic cardiac contractility. These concomitant effects lead us to conclude that inhibition of RAS probably has no important beneficial effect on the oxygen demand/oxygen supply ratio in the myocardium distal to the coronary artery stenosis.", 
    "236": "Studies on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which represent a model of genetically determined arterial hypertension, revealed that cardiac hypertrophy can be controlled by blood pressure normalization by use of various antihypertensive drugs such as hydralazine, captopril, metoprolol, guanethidine, and alpha-methyldopa. Adrenergic influences seem to play a part except for left ventricular (LV) systolic unloading on cardiac hypertrophy, because LV hypertrophy was quantitatively less expressed after a combined therapy with both metoprolol and hydralazine than after a single hydralazine treatment, although blood pressure was not different between the groups. To study whether nifedipine can cause an already existing cardiac hypertrophy to regress, 20-week-old SHR were treated with nifedipine for a period of 20 weeks. After nifedipine treatment, LV muscle mass/body weight ratio was significantly less than before therapy (2.13 +/- 0.18 vs. 2.37 +/- 0.30 mg/g; p less than 0.05). Mass to volume ratio, i.e., quotient of LV muscle mass and LV end-diastolic volume, dropped from 3.40 +/- 0.66 to 3.07 +/- 0.30 mg/microliters (p less than 0.05) after therapy. Accordingly, an antihypertensive treatment with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine can cause an already existing LV hypertrophy in SHR to regress. Because blood pressure reduction resulting from therapy with beta-receptor-blockers, vasodilators, sympatholytic drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers has qualitatively similar effects with respect to causing regression of hypertrophy, reversal of cardiac hypertrophy seems to be mainly related to the reduced LV systolic load. Specific pharmacodynamic effects may only modulate the extent of LV mass reduction along with blood pressure normalization.", 
    "237": "If antihypertensive treatment, especially emergency blood pressure lowering, is always to be safe, more thought should be given to autoregulation of cerebral blood in the hypertensive patient. This topic is reviewed in the present article, in the hypertensive patient. This topic is reviewed in the present article, particular emphasis being placed on the resetting of the lower limit of autoregulation to higher pressure in hypertension and the effects of acute administration of anti-hypertensive drugs on CBF and CBF-autoregulation.", 
    "238": "Relationships between renal haemodynamics and the renin-angiotensin system were examined in 128 male adolescents with differing predispositions to hypertension. Baseline renal vascular resistance (RVR) was significantly elevated in the normotensive subjects with a positive family history, NT (FH+) group, than in the normotensives with a negative family history, NT (FH-) group, while there were no significant differences in other characteristics between the two groups. The borderline hypertensive subjects with a positive family history, BH (FH+) group, showed an even bigger increase in RVR and also had elevated plasma renin activity (PRA). In the NT (FH+) and BH (FH+) groups RVR correlated significantly with PRA levels. When captopril was given, the increased RVR in the NT (FH+) and BH (FH+) groups decreased, in correlation with baseline PRA, to levels not significantly different from those in the NT (FH-) group, in which no significant changes occurred in RVR. These results suggest that RVR may increase primarily in adolescents genetically predisposed to essential hypertension and that the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in the mechanism of this increase in RVR.", 
    "239": "The active fragment derived from factor XII (factor XIIf) was purified from human plasma and administered intravenously to normotensive conscious rats. Factor XIIf-mediated hypotension was dose-dependent and augmented by pretreatment with captopril, an inhibitor of the bradykinin-processing enzyme kininase II. These results therefore suggest that factor XIIf-mediated hypotension is due to the formation of bradykinin.", 
    "240": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity is present in human sarcoid as well as murine schistosome granulomas. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by captopril results in decreased granuloma size in animals. Since captopril is used clinically to treat hypertension, its effect on human lymphocyte thymidine incorporation was determined. It was found that 5 X 10(-5) M and 10(-4) M captopril enhances lymphocyte thymidine uptake induced by 25 micrograms/ml phytohaemagglutinin-P. This suggests that captopril can alter immunological reactivity in man and that angiotensin-converting enzyme may have an immunological function.", 
    "241": "Short term response to single dose of Captopril has been studied in 7 severely hypertensive children. Blood pressure fell within one hour in patients with a non-hypervolemic state. Longterm treatment (average 19 months) of 5 children with refractory hypertension resulted in a sustained blood pressure control. No side-effects had been observed. It is concluded, that Captopril is useful in children with acute severe hypertension. Longterm treatment should be limited to children with refractory hypertension.",

Treatment of methacrylic acid (I) with a hydrogen halide gave the 3-halogeno-2-methylpropanoic acids II and III, which were treated with thionyl chloride to yield the corresponding 3-halogeno-2-methylpropanoyl chlorides IV and V. Treatment of IV or V with L-proline yielded the N-(R,S-3-halogeno-2-methylpropanoyl)-L-prolines VI and VII, which were separated into optically pure R- and S-diastereoisomers using dicyclohexylamine. Treatment of halides of VI or VII with methanolic ammonium hydrosulfide gave captopril in 28% yield.", 
    "243": "The gastric and intestinal absorption of captopril, an orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was determined using rat in situ gastric pouch and intestinal loop techniques and compared with the absorption of another acidic drug, salicylic acid, whose absorption has been well established from both gastric and intestinal sites. Captopril absorption was determined at two initial intraluminal concentrations in acute (untreated) rats and in rats that had been chronically treated with captopril. Salicylic acid absorption was determined at one concentration in acute rats. During the 40-min experimental period, captopril absorption at the 4.6 mM dose from the gastric pouch was 17.0 +/- 1.8% and 17.9 +/- 5.4% in acute and chronically treated rats, respectively, and 33.6 +/- 9.2% and 23.7 +/- 7.6%, respectively, from the intestinal loop. At the 11.5 mM dose the captopril absorption in 40 min was 13.7 +/- 2.7% and 17.3 +/- 4.2% from the gastric pouch of acutely and chronically treated rats, respectively, and 17.8 +/- 4.2% and 22.9 +/- 3.3%, respectively, from the intestinal loop. As similar fractions of the different administered doses were absorbed from the respective gastric and intestinal sites in both acutely and chronically treated rats, the absorption process of captopril appears to be principally by passive diffusion and unaffected by chronic administration of captopril. In comparison, salicylic acid was absorbed more rapidly and to a greater extent from both the gastric and intestinal preparations. The percent of salicylic acid absorbed into the plasma at the 11.5 mM dose was 44.8 +/- 4.4% and 65.3 +/- 5.3% from the gastric and intestinal preparations, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Complications caused by captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, have been reported previously in hypertensive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or with renal artery stenosis after renal transplantation. It is recommended that this drug be used with caution in this setting.", 
    "245": "Captopril (Capoten), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is being used increasingly in the treatment of both hypertension and congestive heart failure. Many of the patients with these disease states have treatment regimens including potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements. In monitoring of five such patients, a significant increase in serum potassium level (3.88 +/- 0.41 to 4.84 +/- 0.45 mEq/L) was noted once captopril was added to their therapy. Laboratory-diagnosed hyperkalemia occurred in three of these patients. Serum potassium levels remained elevated until potassium supplementation or captopril therapy was reduced or discontinued. The combination of captopril and potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics represents a potentially important drug interaction. Patients should be closely monitored for possible hyperkalemia when using these drug combinations.", 
    "246": "We have previously shown that continuous captopril administration prevents hypertension from developing in the two-kidney, one-clip (2K, 1C) rat. The present investigation was designed to determine the mechanism(s) producing the hypertension. In one series of experiments captopril prevented pressure from increasing during an 8-wk treatment period. Relative to the last day of treatment, mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were increased and cardiac output was unchanged at 3, 7, and 28 days after captopril cessation. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was unchanged 3, 7, and 14 days after captopril cessation but was elevated at 28, 49, and 56 days after captopril cessation only in 2K, 1C rats with severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg). Guanethidine (45 mg/kg po, bid) did not prevent the development of 2K, 1C hypertension but did prevent the hypertension from developing after cessation of captopril. Blockade of the prostaglandin system with indomethacin (5 mg/kg + 50 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) and of the kallikrein-kinin system with aprotinin (25,000 KIU + 150 KIU X kg-1 X min-1) for 2 h had no effect on captopril's antihypertensive effect. Additionally, no change in sodium or water balance was observed after captopril cessation. Taken together these data demonstrate that hypertension after captopril cessation is due to an increase in TPR. Additionally, the rise in TPR is due to both the sympathetic nervous and the renin-angiotensin systems since both systems must be functional before pressure rises.", 
    "247": "Vascular changes that develop during the course of blood pressure rise in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) can be modified by antihypertensive therapy. It is not known, however, whether there is selectivity in the structural response to specific antihypertensive drugs. This issue was examined by comparing the effects of a direct vasodilator (hydralazine) and a converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) on morphologic aspects of the cardiovascular system. Male SHRs, 21 weeks of age, were given either hydralazine (HCl plus hydrochlorothiazide, captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide, or hydrochlorothiazide alone. Untreated age-matched SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKYs) were used as controls. Animals were sacrificed at 27-28 weeks of age. Both hydralazine and captopril lowered significantly the blood pressure of SHRs, whereas hydrochlorothiazide alone was ineffective. The heart/body weight ratios were dramatically reduced in captopril-treated SHRs to below the level of WKYs; hydralazine induced only a very modest (5%) reduction, whereas the diuretic alone was ineffective. The morphology of the aortic intima improved dramatically in response to captopril and hydralazine and, to a lesser extent, hydrochlorothiazide alone. This effect becomes apparent within 6 weeks of treatment, and the only evidence of preexisting disease is the persistence of collagen in the subendothelium. Captopril and hydralazine, but not hydrochlorothiazide alone, reduce the thickness of the aortic media below that of normotensive controls. In addition, captopril and hydralazine improve the structure of small intrarenal vessels. There was a strong correlation between the relative effectiveness of the three pharmacologic agents in lowering blood pressure and in improving the changes of intrarenal vessels. These results highlight the capacity of antihypertensive therapy to arrest or reverse the structural sequelae of hypertension. In addition, they underscore the heterogeneity in the response of different components of the cardiovascular system, which, in part, reflects selectivity in the action of antihypertensive agents.", 
    "248": "We investigated the effect of two protease inhibitors, captopril and aprotinin, on tubuloglomerular feedback. In anesthetized rats, 15 or 25 mg/kg captopril significantly reduced the change of early proximal flow rate achieved by raising loop of Henle perfusion rate from 0 to 40 nl/min. Consistent with this reduction of maximum responses, there was a rise of single nephron glomerular filtration rate from 30.7 +/- 1.15 to 35.0 +/- 0.93 nl/min (P less than 0.01) following 25 mg/kg captopril. Infusion of aprotinin at 40,000 KIU/h produced an increase in maximum feedback responses from 38.2 +/- 1.66 to 56.8 +/- 2.35% (P less than 0.05). Infusion of aprotinin in two different doses (20,000 or 40,000 KIU/h) diminished or prevented the effect of 25 mg/kg captopril on maximum feedback responses. Since the main action of aprotinin is believed to be kallikrein inhibition, our data suggest that the magnitude of feedback responses may be affected by the kallikrein-kinin system and that the action of captopril may be in part mediated by its interference with kinin metabolism.", 
    "249": "Antihypertensive drugs act centrally (methyldopa, clonidine, guanabenz), peripherally (prazosin, guanadrel, guanethedine, hydralazine, minoxidil), centrally and peripherally (beta-adrenergic blocking drugs) and systemically [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics]. Centrally-acting antihypertensives decrease blood pressure by diminishing sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre. Peripherally-acting antihypertensives act by depleting or inhibiting the release of catecholamines from the peripheral nerve ending or altering the response at alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor sites. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs act through a variety of mechanisms by either decreasing cardiac output, decreasing renin release, inhibiting prejunctional release of norepinephrine or through central mechanisms. Diuretics act as indirect vasodilators by depleting salt and water not only within the intravascular compartment but within the intramural portion of the arteriole, thereby diminishing its responsiveness to catecholamine and angiotensin II stimulation. ACE inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril act by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II thereby decreasing the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II and the aldosterone production secondary to angiotensin II stimulation. The main differences between captopril and enalapril is that enalapril does not possess the potentially toxic sulphydryl group and can be given twice-daily. Both drugs may show accumulation in patients with impaired renal function.", 
    "250": "Enalapril alone, 10-40 mg given once-daily, controlled systemic hypertension long-term (mean follow-up time 19 months) in patients with renal artery stenosis. Significant, but usually modest, increases in serum creatinine and urea were observed. No serious side-effects were seen. A highly significant reduction in peripheral plasma angiotensin II was maintained 24 h after the previous dose of enalapril. Plasma active renin concentration rose 20-fold with long-term enalapril, when the stenotic kidney showed significant secretion of inactive, as well as of active renin. With enalapril therapy, the contralateral kidney showed net extraction of active renin. In unilateral renal artery stenosis, circulation on the affected side is diminished and is mainly via the juxtamedullary nephrons, which become rich in associated renin. Important intrarenal compensatory actions of the renin-angiotensin system include support of glomerular filtration, enhancement of vasa recta-mediated counter-current exchange, sustained urea excretion and maintenance of renal artery pressure distal to the stenosis. These compensatory effects are lost with converting enzyme inhibition. Thus in patients who are candidates for operation, enalapril should usually be given for no more than one month before proceeding to corrective surgery, to allow maximum blood pressure reduction without endangering the stenotic kidney for too long. Enalapril can nevertheless be given effectively long-term in patients unsuitable for corrective surgery.", 
    "251": "The individual target organ response to blood pressure reduction is an important criterion in the selection of appropriate antihypertensive therapy. We assessed both the renal and the systemic haemodynamic responses to antihypertensive monotherapy (five to seven weeks) with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (n = 12), in contrast to the cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol (n = 11) in subjects with essential hypertension. Enalapril lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the fall in blood pressure was mediated haemodynamically by a 34% fall in systemic vascular resistance. In the kidney, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow and renal blood flow were maintained by a 23% fall in renal vascular resistance. The disproportionate fall in systemic resistance versus renal resistance actually reduced the renal fraction of cardiac output. By contrast, metoprolol lowered predominantly diastolic blood pressure, with an associated 25% fall in cardiac output, without significant changes in overall systemic vascular resistance. In the renal circulation, renal perfusion was well maintained by a 20% fall in renal vascular resistance, perhaps at the efferent arteriole, without change in the renal fraction of cardiac output. Neither drug altered weight, plasma volume or total blood volume. Thus, each drug represents effective antihypertensive monotherapy, with a generally favourable, though different, renal haemodynamic profile, characterized by effective autoregulation of renal perfusion even in the face of a fall in perfusion pressure.",

Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were randomly allocated to one of two stepped-care treatment groups: enalapril 20 mg once-a-day, or placebo as the first step, followed when necessary by the successive addition of hydrochlorothiazide (25 and 50 mg), oxprenolol (160 and 320 mg) and dihydralazine (50 and 100 mg). Blood pressure was normalized in both groups, although the enalapril group showed lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures than the placebo group (systolic 130.5 +/- 12 versus 136.6 +/- 9 mmHg, P less than 0.01; diastolic 82.8 +/- 6 versus 87.0 +/- 5 mmHg, P less than 0.001). These results were obtained with a smaller number of tablets per day (2.6 +/- 1.8 versus 4.2 +/- 2.4 mmHg, P less than 0.0001). Plasma potassium was identical for both groups at the start of treatment. At the end of the study, it was significantly higher in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (4.1 +/- 0.3 versus 3.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/l; P less than 0.05). Spontaneous complaints were noted during the bi-weekly or monthly visit and were also expressed by patients completing a self-administered questionnaire. Differences in spontaneous complaints or in the symptoms evaluated by the questionnaire were not significant.

    "254": "We studied left ventricular function by equilibrium-gated technetium-99m ejection fraction and global left ventricular perfusion by thallium-201 scintigraphy in 43 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Patients were studied at rest and during submaximal (approximately 50% of VO2 max) supine bicycle exercise, off therapy and on four forms of therapy for 16 weeks: methyldopa (n = 9); propranolol (n = 9); hydrochlorothiazide (n = 9); and enalapril (n = 16). None of the patients had focal myocardial ischaemia or heart failure. There were no differences between methyldopa, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril in blood pressure responses to exercise. However, heart rate at rest (57 +/- 4.6 beats/min) and during exercise (108 +/- 8.0 beats/min) was significantly lower in patients on propranolol than in other groups (70 +/- 3.9 and 117 +/- 5.5 beats/min for methyldopa; 75 +/- 3.3 and 119 +/- 4.9 beats/min for hydrochlorothiazide; 74 +/- 2.8 and 125 +/- 2.6 beats/min for enalapril). In the propranolol-treated group, mean ejection fraction fell from 55% at rest to 49% during exercise. This suggests that cardiac output is likely to be lower and peripheral resistance higher during exercise in patients on propranolol than on other forms of treatment. There were no significant differences in coronary perfusion responses to exercise, however, or in the ratio of coronary perfusion to rate-pressure product, between any of the groups. These findings suggest that the limitation in exercise tolerance often reported by patients on beta-blockers is not due to coronary insufficiency during exercise, but to an attenuation of the cardiac output response to exercise, together with a raised peripheral vascular resistance.", 
    "255": "Enalapril is a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and has been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of both renovascular and essential hypertension. We have studied the systemic and renal haemodynamic, biochemical and cardiac adaptive changes induced by this agent in eight patients with essential hypertension before and after 12 weeks of therapy. Mean arterial pressure fell from 110 to 90 mmHg (P less than 0.01) and this was mediated through a fall in total peripheral resistance, cardiac index and heart rate remaining unchanged. Renal plasma flow rose in six patients. Renal vascular resistance fell in all patients (P less than 0.01). Left ventricular mass index was reduced from a mean of 166 +/- 29 to 117 +/- 8 g/m2 (P less than 0.05) and systolic ventricular function remained unchanged. Thus, enalapril lowers arterial pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance, has favourable haemodynamic effects on the kidney, and produces a reduction in left ventricular mass within three months of the start of therapy.",

Overall body weight and body fluid volume (isotope dilution technique) remained unchanged, but in the subgroup receiving enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide, blood volume fell by 12% (P less than 0.01). No side-effects were seen. In conclusion, enalapril monotherapy reduces blood pressure in two-thirds of patients with moderately severe essential hypertension at rest and during exercise, associated with a significant reduction in TPRI. One-third of patients require a diuretic in addition to enalapril. In this subgroup the reduction in TPRI was about twice the reduction seen during enalapril treatment alone, and there was a fall in blood volume.", 
    "257": "Forty to fifty percent of patients with essential hypertension are unable to modify their adrenal and renal vascular responses to angiotensin II with changes in sodium intake. These individuals have been termed 'non-modulators'. To define the role of angiotensin II in mediating this abnormality, angiotensin II infusions were performed in 31 sodium-restricted subjects before and after 72 h of converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Forty percent of these patients had a reduced adrenal response to angiotensin II. When the ACE inhibitor was given to normotensive subjects or hypertensive modulators no change in adrenal responsiveness to angiotensin II was observed. In contrast, in the non-modulators, short-term ACE inhibition significantly enhanced the angiotensin II dose-response curve (P less than 0.01). In a subset of five non-modulators, a third angiotensin II infusion was performed 6-8 weeks after starting the ACE inhibitor. A further enhancement of the adrenal response to angiotensin II was observed at this time point. There was no discernible difference between the response of the non-modulators and the modulating essential hypertensive patients or normotensive controls. Thus, in nearly half of the patients with essential hypertension, ACE inhibition appears to correct an abnormality in the sodium-mediated modulation of adrenal responses to angiotensin II, suggesting that this abnormality reflects an alteration in the interaction of angiotensin II and its receptor.", 
    "258": "Enalapril is a long-acting, sulphydryl-free, ACE inhibitor whose humoral and hypotensive effects are maximal at 4-8 h and remain detectable at 24 h after a single dose. Serum profiles after chronic dosing of enalapril show little accumulation of the active diacid metabolite, enalaprilat. Comparison between the observed and predicted steady-state urinary recoveries of enalaprilat yields an effective accumulation half-life of approximately 11 h. In normotensive subjects, enalapril increases renal blood flow whilst leaving glomerular filtration unchanged irrespective of the state of sodium balance. Similarly under conditions of salt loading and salt depletion, a biphasic saluretic response is seen which parallels the excretory maxima for unchanged enalapril (1-2 h) and enalaprilat (4-8 h) suggesting direct interference by the drug moieties with tubular NaCl reabsorption. During the period of maximal enalapril action, uricosuria and phosphaturia are seen, supporting a direct action of enalaprilat on proximal tubular handling of these anions. Detailed documentation of the chronic metabolic effects of enalapril remains incomplete. A small rise in plasma potassium concentrations can occur but overt hyperkalaemia is unlikely in the absence of gross renal failure. Continued dosing is associated with a fall in plasma uric acid concentrations; plasma prolactin concentrations remain unaltered.", 
    "259": "Enalapril is administered as the ethyl ester of the potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat. As such, it is 60% absorbed and 40% bioavailable as the active species. Absorption is not affected by food. Serum concentrations are proportional to dose, less a small drug residue apparently bound to the enzyme. The half-life for accumulation is approximately 11 h. The drug is eliminated by the kidney without further metabolism. Maximum inhibition of plasma ACE occurs 2-4 h after administration and persists for more than 24 h with clinical doses. ACE inhibition is associated with increases in plasma renin and angiotensin I levels, decreases in angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations and reduction in blood pressure. All of these events are closely correlated when analysed statistically. The clinical and haemodynamic effects of these actions are addressed in other papers.", 
    "260": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the control of blood pressure in normal rodents, primates and man has been evaluated using inhibitors which block the system at various stages. Renin plays a major role in the maintenance of blood pressure under volume depletion. In subjects with a normal salt intake, the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system in maintaining blood pressure levels can be evaluated using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The contribution of the renin-angiotensin system can now be evaluated more closely following the development of new substances which block the renin-angiotensinogen reaction. Available data strongly suggest that renin contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure levels in subjects with a normal salt intake, although to a lesser degree than in subjects on a low sodium intake. The renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure levels in normal experimental animals and man--its importance depending on the state of sodium balance.", 
    "261": "To date, more than 5000 patients have had experience with enalapril. Over 1000 subjects have been exposed to the drug for more than one year and approximately 600 for over two years. In controlled trials, 2249 subjects, who included normal volunteers and patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure, have received enalapril alone or concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide or other antihypertensive agents. There have been no deaths attributed to enalapril. The incidence of serious adverse experiences in controlled trials was similar to placebo, and was not higher in the elderly. The incidence of adverse experiences was not dose-related. Drug discontinuation due to adverse experiences was 3.5%, similar to placebo, and approximately half that of control drugs. Serious laboratory adverse experiences were rare. Enalapril attenuated the adverse metabolic effects of hydrochlorothiazide, particularly hypokalaemia. Skin rash occurred in approximately 1.0% of patients. One case of transient taste loss occurred on enalapril, and one on enalapril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Neutropenia and agranulocytosis were not encountered. Mean white blood cell counts did not change overall. Most patients (approximately equal to 80%) show no change or an improvement in renal function on enalapril. Discontinuation of concomitant hydrochlorothiazide usually normalized renal function. Enalapril is well tolerated in renal insufficiency. Azotaemia may occur in bilateral renovascular hypertension. Proteinuria was rarely seen and often improved on enalapril. Compassionate use protocols have been available to patients either resistant or intolerant to captopril. Of 68 patients admitted for captopril-related skin rashes, only five recurred on enalapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "262": "When added to hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril is as effective as captopril in the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension. It is also effective when used as monotherapy, and may be incorporated into a regimen with diuretic and methyldopa or timolol for the treatment of more resistant patients. Enalapril has a good safety profile as measured by frequency of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences.", 
    "263": "Fifty-three patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were treated with enalapril (10-40 mg q.d.) alone, in combination with a fixed dose of hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day), or in a randomized cross-over study with varying dosages of hydrochlorothiazide (50, 25, 12.5 mg/day). Normalization of blood pressure was obtained in 47% of the patients after enalapril. In the remaining patients, all except four were normalized by the combination with hydrochlorothiazide. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide was required in six patients who had optimally responded to enalapril during the first three months. In the cross-over study, diastolic blood pressure was maintained below 95 mmHg with all the doses of diuretic used in association with 40 mg enalapril. No adverse metabolic (blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides), renal (creatinine clearance, urinary lysozyme and gamma-GT) or haematological (total and differential counts) effects were observed after long-term treatment for one year with enalapril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Blood uric acid decreased significantly after enalapril and tended to increase after the combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Enalapril increased Na/K ATPase activity on erythrocyte membranes thus reducing intracellular sodium and increasing potassium.", 
    "264": "Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of captopril attenuates the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). To determine whether these effects are related to inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme we assessed the effects of chronic i.c.v. administration of MK-422 (a converting enzyme inhibitor chemically unrelated to captopril) on arterial pressure and vascular reactivity in young (seven-week-old) male SHR. MK-422 (0.2 or 1.0 microgram/h, osmotic mini pump) was infused into the lateral ventrical for 4 weeks. Control SHR received artificial CSF i.c.v., or 0.2 microgram/h MK-422 i.v. Vascular reactivity to phenylephrine, vasopressin and direct sympathetic nerve stimulation was assessed in renal and mesenteric vascular beds using miniaturized pulsed Doppler flow probes. MK-422 attenuated the development of hypertension. Arterial pressure at 4 weeks of treatment was: SHR-i.c.v. MK-422 (0.1 microgram/h): 137 +/- 3.4; (1.0 microgram/h): 138 +/- 2.9; SHR i.v. MK-422 176 +/- 4.5 and SHR control: 168 +/- 4.9 mmHg (P less than 0.01). SHR-i.c.v. MK-422 showed significantly attenuated increases in mesenteric vascular reactivity in response to vasoconstrictors, nerves and sympathetic nervous stimulation. Dose and frequency response curves were characterized by a shift to the right and a significant decrease in the slopes. In conclusion, both captopril and MK-422 prevent the development of hypertension in SHR, presumably by blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme, suggesting that the brain renin-angiotensin system contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension in that model.", 
    "265": "A method has been developed to localize angiotensin-converting enzyme in tissues by in vitro autoradiography. The potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, MK351A, was labelled with 125I and shown to exhibit saturable, high affinity, reversible binding to membrane fractions of rat lung and caudate-putamen. The radio-ligand bound with a T 1/2 2-3 min at 20 degrees C and dissociated with a T 1/2 of approximately 5 min on addition of excess unlabelled inhibitor. The potency of a series of converting enzyme inhibitors in displacing the radio-ligand closely paralleled their anticatalytic potency, strongly suggesting that the ligand labels the active site of converting enzyme. In vitro autoradiographic analysis using this system revealed a very high density of converting enzyme in rat lung, small bowel muocosa, adrenal zona glomerulosa, adrenal medulla and brain. In the brain, a discrete and characteristic distribution of the enzyme was observed. A very high density of converting enzyme was found in the choroid plexus, subfornical organ, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus and substantia nigra. The enzyme was also localized in discrete regions of the hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala, brain stem and cerebellum.", 
    "266": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is found in human amniotic fluid and foetal membranes taken during Caesarean sections at term. ACE contents are higher in the chorion than in the amnion. Cells cultured from chorion contain ACE together with renin. Chorionic ACE was inhibited by captopril and by an excess of anti-ACE immuneserum. It is concluded that extravascular ACE is present in the uteroplacental complex during pregnancy.", 
    "267": "A 74-year-old man has been known to have scleroderma for 5 years. Two months before the hospitalization, his blood pressure was rapidly elevated, and progressive renal impairment and ulcerations of the fingers manifested. Then he was diagnosed to have a crisis of scleroderma. The treatment with a new long-acting angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate (MK-421), normalized the blood pressure and protected the progress of renal impairment without side effects.", 
    "268": "The precise mechanisms of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy and reversal with antihypertensive drugs are unclear and complex. Enalapril maleate (MK421) and hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ) were used to assess the control of hypertension, and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy in Dahl sensitive (DS) and Dahl resistant (DR) rats given either a high (8% NaCl), or a low (0.4% NaCl) salt diet. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), left ventricular weight/body weight (LVwt/Bwt) ratio were determined. Both drugs were effective in reducing blood pressure and left ventricular mass in DS rats placed on a high salt diet. For DR rats under the same conditions, only MK421 induced significant lowering of blood pressure. Neither drug caused significant change in ventricular mass. Both DS and DR rats on a low salt diet underwent significant blood pressure reduction with MK421 but not HTZ. Significant regression of the left ventricle was observed only in DS rats treated with MK421. Regression was not observed in DR rats even though MK421 reduced blood pressure to distinctly hypotensive levels. The dissociation of left ventricular mass and blood pressure control observed with both MK421 and HTZ suggests that pressure afterload is not the only factor involved in the pathophysiology of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. The mechanisms of anti-hypertensive drug action and salt intake both appear to play a significant if unexplained role.", 
    "269": "To assess the role of renal prostaglandin E in the hypotensive mechanism of MK-421, we evaluated the effects of chronic infusion of MK-421 (6 mg/kg/day i.p.) on systolic blood pressure and urinary prostaglandin E excretion in conscious rats in states of sodium repletion or depletion and also during chronic infusion of norepinephrine (1.8 mg/kg/day i.p.) or vasopressin (7.2 U/kg/day i.p.). The hypotensive effect of MK-421 was greater in sodium depleted than in sodium repleted rats. The hypertensive effect of norepinephrine or vasopressin was inhibited by the simultaneous administration of MK-421. MK-421 induced an increase in the excretion of urinary prostaglandin E, in both sodium repleted and depleted rats. However, simultaneous administration of MK-421 had no influence on the increase in urinary prostaglandin E excretion induced by norepinephrine or vasopressin. In addition, the combined administration of MK-421 with indomethacin (10 mg/kg/day s.c.) still abolished the hypertensive effect of norepinephrine or vasopressin. The disparate effect of MK-421 on urinary prostaglandin E excretion suggests that the renal prostaglandin system is not essential for the mechanism of the hypotensive effect of MK-421.", 
    "270": "The blood-brain barrier permeability to captopril, and the cerebrovascular effects of intracerebroventricular administration of captopril, were studied in normotensive Wistar rats. The blood-brain barrier permeability-surface area product (PS), determined by an integral-uptake method, was about 1 X 10(-5) cm3/g/s in all brain regions studied. This was three to four times lower than the simultaneously determined PS of Na+ and Cl-, both of which are known to have very low blood-brain barrier permeability. Cerebral blood flow, determined by the intra-arterial 133xenon injection method, was unaffected by intracerebroventricular administration of 100 micrograms captopril. Furthermore the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation during haemorrhagic hypotension was also unaffected, being in the mean arterial pressure range (50-69 mmHg) in both controls and captopril-treated rats. It was concluded that the blood-brain barrier permeability of captopril was negligible and that inhibition of the brain renin-angiotensin system has no effect on global cerebral blood flow. The cerebrovascular effects of intravenously administered captopril (a resetting to lower pressure of the limits and range of cerebral blood flow autoregulation) are probably exerted via converting enzyme on the luminal surface of cerebral vessels.", 
    "271": "The cerebrovascular effects of converting enzyme inhibition were examined in normotensive and hypertensive rats. Cerebral blood flow was measured using the intracarotid 133xenon injection method in halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthetized animals. The main finding was that following intravenous administration of captopril (10 mg/kg), cerebral blood flow autoregulation was markedly altered. Although cerebral blood flow was unchanged from baseline levels, both the lower and upper limits of autoregulation were reset to lower mean arterial pressure and the autoregulatory plateau shortened. The lower limit was shifted 20-30 mmHg, the upper limit 50-60 mmHg, and the plateau shortened by 20-40 mmHg. The effect was interpreted as being a consequence of compensatory autoregulatory constriction of small resistance vessels in the brain following captopril-induced dilatation of large resistance vessels. It was inferred that locally produced angiotensin II might play a role in the resistance of large cerebral arteries.", 
    "272": "The active fragment derived from factor XII (factor XIIf) was purified from human plasma and administered intravenously to normotensive conscious rats. Factor XIIf-mediated hypotension was dose-dependent and augmented by pretreatment with captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin I- and bradykinin-processing enzyme. In contrast, factor XIIf-induced hypotension was not enhanced by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by saralasin, a competitive antagonist of angiotensin II at the vascular receptor level. These results suggest that factor XIIf-mediated hypotension is due to the formation of bradykinin.", 
    "273": "A new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilic acid (MK-422), was given in a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg i.v., followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/hr to determine its effects in hemorrhagic shock. MK-422 produced no significant hemodynamic effects in sham shock controls, yet it effectively blocked the pressor effect of exogenously administered angiotensin I throughout the 260-min experimental period and reduced angiotensin converting enzyme activity by 90% as determined by radiochemical assay. In vitro studies on cat papillary muscles and pancreatic homogenates revealed no direct inotropic or antiproteolytic effect of enalaprilic acid. Nevertheless, converting enzyme inhibitor treatment maintained postreinfusion mean arterial blood pressure at a significantly higher value (P less than .01) than that of untreated hemorrhaged animals (66 +/- 5 vs. 27 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively). Superior mesenteric artery flow for hemorrhaged cats was significantly higher (P less than .05) in the treated group both during the end of the oligemic period (6.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.8 ml/kg/min) and during the postreinfusion period (6.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.9 +/- 1.0 ml/kg/min). Moreover, enalaprilic acid blunted the marked rise in plasma cathepsin D (P less than .01) and myocardial depressant factor activities (P less than .01), and plasma amino-nitrogen concentrations (P less than .05) observed in the untreated hemorrhaged cats. These results indicate that enalaprilic acid improved the hemodynamic and metabolic status of cats in hemorrhagic shock.",

    "275": "[3H]Captopril autoradiography visualizes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.14.5.1) in the reproductive tract of male rats. [3H]Captopril binds to testicular slices with high affinity (Kd = 4.4 nM) and displays a pharmacological profile similar to that of ACE activity. High densities of [3H] captopril autoradiographic silver grains are found over spermatid heads and in the lumen of seminiferous tubules in stages I-VIII and XII-XIV. Tubules in stages IX-XI exhibit only one fifth the level of binding. The basal epithelium and interstitial tissue are not labeled. The initial segment of the epididymis contains very low levels of grains. The head of the epididymis demonstrates intense grain density at the luminal surface of the epithelium, with little luminal labeling. In a progression to the tail of the epididymis, epithelium labeling declines, and luminal grains increase. The lumen of the vas deferens is also labeled. ACE from testis and several regions of the epididymis has been categorized with respect to its particulate vs. soluble nature and its ability to be precipitated by an antirat lung ACE monoclonal antibody. Testicular ACE is particulate and not immunoprecipitable. The distribution of immunoprecipitable particulate ACE in the epididymis is similar to that of autoradiographic silver grains over the epithelium. The concentration of particulate but nonprecipitable ACE gradually rises from the initial segment to the tail of the epididymis, similar to the distribution of luminal [3H]captopril-associated grains. Soluble ACE activity, present in equal concentration throughout the epididymis and not immunoprecipitable, may not be detected by autoradiography of [3H]captopril.", 
    "276": "The effect of enalapril, an antihypertensive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, on plasma catecholamine levels and plasma volume (PV) has not been well established. In a randomized, double-blind study, 29 subjects (28 blacks and one white) received one of the following dosing regimens: hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 25 mg twice a day (group 1; n = 12); enalapril, 10 mg twice a day (group 2; n = 12); or enalapril, 10 mg twice a day, with HCTZ, 25 mg twice a day (group 3; n = 5). Dosages were doubled after 4 wk if diastolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg. After 8 wk of therapy, supine blood pressure decreased by 24.1/16.0 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) in group 1, by 10.8/4.0 mm Hg in group 2, and by 48.0/27.8 mm Hg in group 3. Mean values of supine plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine did not change with therapy. PV fell 7.9% in group 1, 1.3% in group 2, and 5.0% in group 3. There were no correlations between changes in PV and blood pressure, but a decrease in PV correlated with an increase in plasma norepinephrine levels in the group treated with HCTZ alone (r = -0.65) and in all 29 subjects combined (r = -0.45). Enalapril alone was not very effective in lowering blood pressure in these subjects, but the combination of enalapril with HCTZ was very effective. There was no evidence of a direct effect of enalapril on the sympathetic nervous system or on PV.", 
    "277": "Modification of alanyl proline by introduction of both zinc coordinating and S1 subsite binding interactions affords potent new carboxy- and mercapto-acyl dipeptide angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Design of these inhibitors was guided by an extension of the hypothetical ACE active site model originally used to derive captopril. Significant increases in ACE inhibitory activity were observed by introduction of conformation constraint into acyclic acyl dipeptides, thus further defining the three dimensional structure of the ACE active site.", 
    "278": "The present study was undertaken to investigate whether the C-terminal extended Met-enkephalin heptapeptide (Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7, MEAP) played a role in mediating the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture in rabbits. MEAP and its degrading enzyme inhibitor captopril as well as antiserum against MEAP were injected into the periaqueductal gray (PAG) via a previously implanted cannula. Their effects on nociception were tested by the escape response latency (ERL) elicited by radiant heat applied on the skin of the snout. (1) Microinjection of MEAP (30-240 nmol) into PAG produced a dose-dependent analgesic effect which was 2.5 times more potent than Met-enkephalin (MEK) and 3 times less potent than morphine. The complete reversal of the analgesia elicited by 240 nmol of MEAP by a small dose of naloxone (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) indicates that the effect of MEAP is mediated by naloxone sensitive opioid receptors. (2) In rabbits, a dose-dependent analgesia was elicited by an intra-PAG injection of captopril (60-240 nmol). A single dose of 240 nmol captopril increased ERL by more than 100%. This effect could be reversed by 30 nmol of naloxone injected into the same site, or by antiserum recognizing MEAP (1 microliter, titer 1:1500) but not by antiserum recognizing MEK (1 microliter, 1:8000) suggesting that captopril was able to protect MEAP from degradation. (3) Intra-PAG injection of 60 nmol of captopril significantly potentiated the after effect of electroacupuncture (EA) induced analgesia. This effect could be blocked either by 30 nmol (but not 7.5 nmol) of naloxone, or by 1 microliter (but not 0.1 microliter) of MEAP antiserum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "279": "The effects of the new, orally administered converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (MK-421), were studied in 12 ambulatory patients with severe cardiac failure who were also receiving digoxin and diuretic agents. The study was double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled and randomized. The clinical characteristics and pretreatment exercise performance were similar in the two groups of patients. All vasodilator drugs had been withdrawn two weeks before the start of the trial. At 12 weeks, the patients receiving enalapril showed a significant improvement in the functional class of the disease, exercise time (P less than 0.01), and maximum workload achieved, and experienced relief of symptoms. Blood pressure fell in patients receiving active treatment suggesting a reduction of afterload. Left ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged in enalapril-treated patients, but fell in patients on placebo (P less than 0.001). Enalapril was well tolerated without apparent adverse effects. It was effective when used with digoxin and diuretic agents in the treatment of severe cardiac failure, and its efficacy was maintained throughout 12 weeks of therapy.", 
    "280": "Limb blood flow and respiratory function were compared in ten patients with severe heart failure inadequately controlled by diuretics and normal control subjects matched for age and sex. Both forearm and calf blood flow, at rest and after exercise, were lower in the patients than in the control subjects. Oxygen consumption during submaximal exercise was also lower in the patients and minute ventilation was higher. Captopril, administered in a single-blind controlled study to the patients, resulted in an improvement in these abnormalities, with the exception of oxygen consumption. It also improved exercise tolerance and reduced perceived exertion during exercise. Captopril is effective treatment for severe heart failure and improves some of the peripheral haemodynamic and respiratory abnormalities.", 
    "281": "The absorption and metabolism of the disulfide dimer conjugate of captopril has been studied in the rat following both oral and intravenous dosing and compared with that of the active monomer, captopril. Metabolism of the dimer to captopril has been shown after both oral and intravenous administration of the dimer (10 mg/kg) with peak plasma levels of captopril (154 ng/ml) occurring at 1 hr post dose. By contrast the peak plasma level of captopril after oral administration of captopril (10 mg/kg) at the same dose was much higher at 678 ng/ml and also occurred at 1 hr post dose. Plasma captopril disulfide species were much higher than the plasma levels of captopril after the administration of either dimer or captopril and tended to persist for much longer than for monomeric captopril particularly after administration of the dimer. Both the dimer and its pharmacologically active product captopril were found in relatively large amounts in lung, kidney and liver following the oral administration of the dimer.", 
    "282": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system may in part be responsible for the abnormally increased vascular tone which occurs in heart failure; it has also been suggested that this system's responsiveness may diminish with age. We investigated the effects of posture and upright exercise on renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone and catecholamines in 8 patients over 65 years and in 10 patients under 65 years, all of whom had congestive heart failure. Samples were taken supine, after 5 min standing in the upright posture, and after exercise. Exercise time was similar between the two groups [5 X 3 +/- 1 X 9 min (mean +/- SD) in the younger group, compared with 5 X 2 +/- 3 X 4 min in the older group]. Resting renin and angiotensin II were similar and rose on standing with a further increase during exercise; there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. However, aldosterone rose during exercise only in the younger group, while increases in plasma noradrenaline were greater in the elderly. This study implies that the efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is likely to be maintained in the elderly patient with heart failure.", 
    "283": "The purpose of the present study was to explore whether, the stimulating contractile action of angiotensin II (AII) or of angiotensin I (AI), in uterine strips isolated from rats, either spayed or spayed and injected with 17-beta estradiol, was somehow linked to tissue generated prostaglandins (PGs). Indomethacin (10(-6)M), shifted to the left the dose-response curve for AII in preparations from ovariectomized animals; augmenting both, the efficacy and the potency of the agonist. Dose-response curves for AII were also explored in the presence of subthreshold concentrations of several exogenous PGs. PGE2 (10(-9) M) completely abolished the influence of indomethacin on the curve for AII; PGD2 (10(-9) M) did not evoke effects and PGF2 alpha (10(-9) M) only altered the threshold dose, the rest of the curve remaining similar to that obtained with indomethacin alone. The cumulative dose-response curve for AI, in strips isolated from ovariectomized rats, was comparable to that for AII and, the presence of indomethacin, only reduced the concentration for the threshold action of AI, in comparison to controls. Captopril (100 ng/ml), shifted to the right the dose-response curve for AI and indomethacin failed to alter the effects of AI in the presence of captopril. In strips isolated from ovariectomized rats, injected with 17-beta estradiol, the low concentration points of the dose-response curve for AII were shifted to the left of those for the agonist in control preparations from spayed rats not treated with estradiol. Furthermore, indomethacin failed to alter the responses to AII in strips from spayed animals injected with 17-beta estradiol. The foregoing results document that an inhibitor of tissue PGs synthesis, namely indomethacin, is able to modify the dose-response curve for AII, rather than that for AI, in the uterus from ovariectomized rats, but not in preparations from spayed animals treated with estradiol. This, as well as the effect of a subthreshold dose of PGs, suggest that a minimum of PGE2 is required for the contractile influence of AII and not for that of AI. Moreover, the absence of estrogen dominance appears, as well, as a crucial factor for the action of AII.", 
    "284": "The USP XX colorimetric assay for the determination of diazotizable substances in hydrochlorothiazide was studied. Colorimetric assay results of hydrochlorothiazide bulk powder and captopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination tablets were found to have a high bias when compared with HPLC. A kinetic study of the diazotization step in the colorimetric assay and extrapolation of the free amine content, i.e., 4-amino-6-chloro-1, 3-benzenedisulfonamide, to time zero provided results which correlated favorably with those obtained by HPLC. The high bias of the colorimetric assay was shown to result from the formation of 4-nitroso derivative of hydrochlorothiazide, which is formed by acid hydrolysis during the diazotization step. Bendroflumethiazide and flumethiazide also showed increasing free amine content when the time of diazotization was increased.", 
    "285": "The pressor actions of homologous kidney extract and human angiotensins I and II were studied in the conscious rat snake, Ptyas korros. A converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), an angiotensin II analogue [( Sar1,Ala8]ANG II), an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist (phentolamine), and a catecholamine releaser (reserpine) were used to elucidate their actions. It was found that captopril attenuated the pressor effects of the kidney extract and angiotensin I but not that of angiotensin II. [Sar1,Ala8]ANG II and phentolamine both significantly attenuated, but did not completely inhibit the vasopressor actions of the kidney extract and angiotensins I and II. However, reserpine administration did not reduce the action of angiotensin II. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system in snakes is similar to those present in mammals and other nonmammalian species, except for the mechanism of angiotensin II action. In the present study, angiotensin II was found to act partly through the alpha-adrenergic receptor which is not as specific as that in mammals and thus may respond to an agonist other than its usual ones, and partly through the vascular angiotensin II receptor.", 
    "286": "A very sensitive and simplified direct radioimmunoassay system for plasma angiotensin II was developed using the antiserum against synthetic angiotensin II (final dilution = 1: 1,500,000) in combination with 125I-labeled angiotensin II (specific activity = 1,600 microCi/micrograms). In this assay system, it was possible to carry out a direct assay using 100 microliter of plasma without any extraction procedure. This conclusion was supported by 100% recovery, parallelism of plasma samples against the standard curve, and no difference in hormone levels, there was also a high positive correlation between the plasma angiotensin II levels measured by this direct assay and the dowex column extraction method. The sensitivity of this assay system was 0.1 pg/tube, which is the highest sensitivity in studies reported to date. The cross-reactivities of angiotensin III and I against this antiserum were 100% and less than 0.1%, respectively, suggesting that the antiserum was very specific for the C-terminal of angiotensin II. Plasma angiotensin II levels in normal subjects after overnight fasting ranged from 3.0 to 21.3 pg/ml (12.0 +/- 2.1 pg/ml, mean +/- SE). By comparison, plasma angiotensin II levels of patients with essential hypertension were similar to those in the normal renin group, lower than those in low renin group and higher than those in high renin group. In patients with secondary hypertension, levels were lower in those with primary aldosteronism and higher in those with renovascular hypertension when compared to normal subjects.",

Blood and urine samples were analyzed by gas chromatography. The peak captopril concentrations attained were 701 +/- 81 ng/ml (mean +/- s.e.m.) after fasting, 351 +/- 56 ng/ml with an antacid (p less than 0.05) and 140 +/- 14 ng/ml after a meal (p less than 0.01). The peak concentrations were reached in 0.5, 0.9 and 1.5 h (p less than 0.01), and the areas under the blood concentration-time curves were 782 +/- 86, 456 +/- 60 (p less than 0.05) and 344 +/- 47 ng X h/ml (p less than 0.01), respectively. The relative bioavailability of captopril was 0.66 and 0.48 with antacid and after food, respectively. The deleterious effect of food - but not that of antacid - was reflected as a delayed hypotensive activity of captopril.", 
    "289": "The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril as long term treatment was investigated in 14 patients with severe congestive heart failure in a double blind trial. Captopril reduced plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and noradrenaline, with a converse increase in active renin concentration. Effective renal plasma flow increased and renal vascular resistance fell; glomerular filtration rate did not change. Serum urea and creatinine concentrations rose. Both serum and total body potassium contents increased; there were no long term changes in serum concentration or total body content of sodium. Exercise tolerance was appreciably improved, and dyspnoea and fatigue lessened. Left ventricular end systolic and end diastolic dimensions were reduced. There was an appreciable reduction in complex ventricular ectopic rhythms. Adverse effects were few: weight gain and fluid retention were evident in five patients when captopril was introduced and two patients initially experienced mild postural dizziness; rashes in two patients did not recur when the drug was reintroduced at a lower dose; there was a significant reduction in white cell count overall, but the lowest individual white cell count was 4000 X 10(6)/l. Captopril thus seemed to be of considerable value in the long term treatment of severe cardiac failure.", 
    "290": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril improves the altered hemodynamics in many patients with chronic heart failure, but the first dose may precipitate hypotension. Ten patients with chronic heart failure were studied, nine with high plasma concentrations of renin and one with a low concentration. Frequent measurements of plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, renin, and catecholamines were made over 60 minutes after a small dose (6.25 mg) of captopril and related to concurrently measured hemodynamic variables. Captopril caused a decrease in systemic and pulmonary artery pressure and an increase in cardiac index, and these changes coincided with reductions in the plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and increases in plasma concentrations of renin. The hemodynamic changes were accompanied by reductions in the plasma concentrations of norepinephrine but transient increases in plasma concentrations of epinephrine in patients in whom vasomotor syncope developed. The patient with a low plasma renin concentration showed little hemodynamic response to the drug. It is concluded that vasomotor syncope occurs quite frequently in patients with severe chronic heart failure after captopril in a small dose and is associated with a selective increase in epinephrine secretion from the adrenal medulla.", 
    "291": "It was shown previously that the tridecapeptide neurotensin is inactivated by rat brain synaptic membranes and that one of the primary inactivating cleavages occurs at the Pro10-Try11 peptide bond, leading to the formation of NT1-10 and NT11-13. The present study was designed to investigate the possibility that this cleavage was catalyzed by proline endopeptidase and/or endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase). Purified rat brain synaptic membranes were found to contain a N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-4-methyl-coumarinyl-7-amide-hydrolyzin g activity that was markedly inhibited (93%) by the proline endopeptidase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Prolinal and partially blocked (25%) by an antiproline endopeptidase antiserum. In contrast, the cleavage of neurotensin at the Pro10-Tyr11 bond by synaptic membranes was not affected by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Prolinal and the antiserum. When the conversion of NT1-10 to NT1-8 by angiotensin converting enzyme was blocked by captopril and when the processing of NT11-13 by aminopeptidase(s) was inhibited by bestatin, it was found that thiorphan, a potent endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, partially decreased the formation of NT1-10 and NT11-13 by synaptic membranes.", 
    "292": "(1) proline endopeptidase, although it is present in synaptic membranes, is not involved in the cleavage of neurotensin at the Pro10-Tyr11 bond; (2) endopeptidase 24.11 only partially contributes to this cleavage; (3) there exists in rat brain synaptic membranes a peptidase different from proline endopeptidase and endopeptidase 24.11 that is mainly responsible for inactivating neurotensin by cleaving at the Pro10-Tyr11 bond.", 
    "293": "The angiotensin cascade was recently detected in liver granulomas of murine Schistosomiasis mansoni, suggesting an immunoregulatory role for angiotensins in inflammation. In this study, isolated liver granulomas were fractionated into macrophage or lymphocyte-eosinophil-rich populations to determine the cellular origin of these hormones. Immunoreactive angiotensins I, II, and III (AI, AII, and AIII) were detected in granuloma macrophage homogenates by radioimmunoassay and chromatography. No angiotensins were associated with the lymphocyte-eosinophil fraction. Isolated granuloma macrophages, but not the lymphocyte-eosinophil fraction, retained appreciable angiotensins when cultured in vitro and spontaneously released these peptides into the culture medium. Similarly, culture of these cells in the presence of exogenous angiotensinogen or AI resulted in additional AI and/or AII/III appearing in the medium. These data support the contention that granuloma macrophages generate angiotensins from both endogenous and exogenous substrates.", 
    "294": "Angiotensin II has been previously implicated as a mediator of vasoconstriction during the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with teprotide (SQ 20881) on development of pulmonary hypertension was determined by measurement of the drug's ability to modify hypertension-induced protein synthetic changes in the rat pulmonary trunk. Rats were injected with either SQ 20881 (2 mg/kg body wt every 8 hr) or saline vehicle during exposure to chronic hypoxia at 0.5 atm for either 3 or 7 days. Comparisons were made of tissue weight, absolute protein content, and in vitro synthesis of collagen and noncollagen protein of the pulmonary trunks of SQ-treated hypoxic, SQ-treated normoxic, saline-treated hypoxic, and saline-treated normoxic rats. Treatment of hypoxic rats with SQ 20881 was found to significantly decrease right ventricular pressure, tissue weight, absolute protein content, and in vitro protein synthesis after 7 days compared to saline-treated hypoxic rats. Neither right ventricular hypertrophy nor the development of polycythemia was decreased by SQ 20881 treatment.", 
    "295": "Thiol methylation is an important pathway in the biotransformation of sulfhydryl drugs such as captopril. Human red blood cell (RBC) membranes contain a thiol methyltransferase (TMT) activity that catalyzes the S-methylation of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). These experiments were performed to determine whether human RBC membranes contained enzymes that could catalyze the S-methylation of thiol drugs, and, if so, to determine whether those enzymes were similar to the RBC membrane TMT that catalyzes the S-methylation of 2-ME. Human RBC membranes were able to catalyze the methylation of captopril, N-acetylcysteine, and 7 alpha-thio-spirolactone, a sulfhydryl metabolite of spironolactone. Those activities and 2-ME TMT were similar with respect to subcellular distribution, inhibitor sensitivity, and thermal stability. When activities of the methyltransferase enzymes for 2-ME and for the three thiol drugs were measured in RBC membranes from 19 individual subjects, there were highly significant correlations among all four activities (r greater than 0.96 for all comparisons). These observations suggested either that a single enzyme in the human RBC membrane catalyzed the S-methylation of all of these compounds, or, less likely, that these were four separate activities regulated in parallel with similar properties. Experiments were then performed to identify the products of the enzyme reactions. The product of the reaction performed with 7 alpha-thio-spirolactone was the expected S-methyl derivative, 7 alpha-thiomethyl-spirolactone. However, it was found that lipophilic conjugates of the S-methyl derivatives of captopril and N-acetylcysteine were formed during the in vitro enzyme reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "296": "In chloralose anaesthetized rats, intravenous administration of captopril, SQ 20881, SA 446 or MK 421 (0.5 mg/kg) potentiated the depressor responses to arachidonic acid 3 mg/kg given intravenously. Same doses of the above angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors caused an approximately 100-fold decrease in sensitivity to the pressor effects of angiotensin I, with a concomitant similar increase in sensitivity to the depressor effects of bradykinin. Depressor responses to arachidonic acid, both before and after administering the converting enzyme inhibitors, were abolished by intravenous indomethacin (5 mg/kg). These results suggest that increased synthesis of prostaglandins in the circulation may contribute to the hypotensive effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, a group of newly developed antihypertensive agents.", 
    "297": "In a randomized, two-period crossover study in 12 normal volunteers, serum and urine concentrations of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat were determined following administration of a single 40-mg tablet of enalapril maleate administered both in the fasting state and with a standard breakfast. A 7-d interval separated the two treatment periods. Area under the serum concentration-time curves for enalaprilat and urinary recoveries for enalaprilat and total drug did not differ significantly between the fed and fasted conditions. The mean observed maximum serum concentration of enalaprilat was slightly higher for the fasting treatment, but the time to peak concentration was almost identical for the two treatments. Enalapril maleate is unlike the prototype angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in that a standard meal does not appear to influence absorption of this new drug.",

Captopril dose-dependently diminished mean arterial blood pressure in both pithed and intact anaesthetized normotensive cats. The hypotensive effectiveness of captopril was most pronounced in pithed cats. Captopril inhibited the hypertensive response to intravenously administered noradrenaline in pithed cats, but did not attenuate the hypertensive response to noradrenaline in intact cats. The results do not exclude that the hypotensive activity of captopril in intact cats may be causally independent of the attenuating effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction as observed in pithed animals.",

ACE inhibition could be reversed by Zn++, but not by Co++, Ca++, or Mg++; therefore, phenacein may chelate the active site zinc of ACE. However, other zinc-containing enzymes were not inhibited at high phenacein concentrations. Phenacein exhibited weak activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but was not active against Candida sp. or Gram-negative organisms.", 
    "301": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of unchanged plasma captopril and the kinetics of the drug effects on plasma converting enzyme activity (PCEA), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (PA) and mean blood pressure (MBP) were studied over 24 h after oral administration in three groups of hypertensive patients: with normal renal function (group 1, plasma creatinine less than 110 mumol/l, n = 10), with moderate chronic renal failure (group 2, 135 less than plasma creatinine less than 450 mumol/l, n = 10) and with severe chronic renal failure (group 3, plasma creatinine greater than 500 mumol/l, n = 10). Renal impairment had no effect on plasma captopril Cmax, CLtot and relative bioavailability (AUC). In contrast, captopril kel decreased while T1/2 increased progressively from group 1 to group 3. PCEA blockade (T1/2 and AUC) was increased significantly and proportionally to the degree of renal impairment. However, there were no differences between the three groups regarding captopril-induced modifications of PRA and PA. Although the maximal reduction in MBP was identical in the three groups, the overall antihypertensive effect (AUC) of captopril increased significantly and progressively from group 1 to group 3, especially in duration. There was no correlation between basal plasma creatinine values and unchanged captopril relative bioavailability (AUC) and between unchanged captopril relative bioavailability (AUC) and the drug effects (AUC) on PCEA, PRA, PA and MBP. However there was a correlation between basal plasma creatinine values and plasma captopril T1/2, PCEA blockade (AUC) and overall antihypertensive effect (AUC). The apparent discrepancy between the lack of effects of chronic renal failure on plasma unchanged captopril bioavailability and its potentiating effects on PCEA blockade and MBP reduction may be accounted for by the renal impairment-induced accumulation of captopril metabolites.", 
    "302": "Central cardiovascular effects of the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+, K+-ATPase) inhibitor, ouabain, were investigated by injecting it intracerebroventricularly (ICV) using conscious Wistar rats. Ouabain, 0.1-10 micrograms injected ICV, produced dose-related pressor responses attaining peak elevations after about 5 min. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of these central pressor responses, angiotensin II blockers were injected ICV before the injections of ouabain. 1-Sar, 8-Ile angiotensin II (ang IIa), 50 micrograms, given 3 min before the ouabain, abolished the pressor responses to ouabain, 5 micrograms. Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI, captopril), 100 micrograms, also significantly attenuated the pressor responses to ouabain. Since previous results with ICV injections of ouabain suggested that the pressor responses are mediated via a release of brain angiotension II, and the site of action of brain angiotensin II is believed to be the anteroventral third ventricle (AV3V) area of the brain, ICV injections of ouabain were repeated using rats whose AV3V areas had been destroyed electrically. The pressor responses were smaller in the AV3V lesioned rats than in sham-operated rats. The abdominal sympathetic nerve activity was recorded using three conscious, normotensive Wistar rats. ICV injections of ouabain, 5 micrograms, elicited pressor responses as described above and these were accompanied by a corresponding increase in the nerve firing, lasting for 5-7 min. These responses were again abolished by pretreatment with an angiotensin II antagonist. These results suggest that centrally administered ouabain elicits vasopressor responses which increase peripheral sympathetic nerve activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Angiotensin II inhibition (ANG II-inhib) was produced by the intravenous administration of [Sar1, Ala8] angiotensin II or MK 421 to investigate whether it modulates the effects of renal nerve stimulation. Micropuncture measurements were obtained before and during renal nerve stimulation. Renal nerve stimulation decreased SNGFR approximately 25% (from 49.9 +/- 2.3 to 38.0 +/- 1.4 nl X min-1 X g kidney wt-1), the result of decreased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure gradient and nephron plasma flow. These decreases were due to increased afferent (approximately 43%) and efferent (approximately 30%) arteriolar resistances, since the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient remained unaffected. The effects of renal nerve stimulation during ANG II-inhib were less in magnitude than in renal nerve stimulation alone: SNGFR decreased from 48.0 +/- 1.5 to 44.8 +/- 2.0 nl X min-1 X g kidney wt-1 after renal nerve stimulation.

Using a specific direct radioimmunoassay, ACE was quantified and characterized in each of the 19 samples tested. Mean level was 136 +/- 83 ng/ml. Amniotic ACE completely crossreacted, like that in plasma and kidney, with antibodies raised against the lung enzyme. ACE activity in amniotic fluid averaged 8.7 +/- 5.6 microU/ml using Hip-His-Leu as substrate and was significantly correlated with ACE antigen levels. ACE was not associated with the cells or the free intracellular organelles in amniotic fluid, and the enzyme was present in soluble form. Angiotensinase activity and high levels of kininase activity were found in amniotic fluid. Inhibition studies with captopril and anti-human ACE antibodies suggest that angiotensinases and kininases other than ACE were also present. Because renin, mostly in inactive form, and angiotensinogen were also found in these amniotic fluids, it appears that a complete, although not fully activated, renin angiotensin system is present in amniotic fluid and fetal membranes during pregnancy.",

When compared to sham-operated control rats, rats with myocardial infarction involving 40 +/- 4% of the left ventricular circumference had lower mean arterial pressure (96 +/- 5 vs. 122 +/- 4 mm Hg, P less than 0.005), and higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (24 +/- 3 vs. 5 +/- 0 mm Hg, P less than 0.001). Renal cortical microcirculatory dynamics of rats with myocardial infarction were characterized by reduced glomerular plasma flow rate (75 +/- 8 vs. 165 +/- 17 nl/min, P less than 0.005), but a proportionately lesser decline in single nephron glomerular filtration rate (28.0 +/- 2.8 vs. 41.7 +/- 3.1 nl/min, P less than 0.025), accounting for the observed rise in single nephron filtration fraction (0.38 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.02, P less than 0.005).

In addition, fractional proximal fluid reabsorption, assessed by end-proximal tubule fluid-to-plasma inulin concentration ratio, was elevated (2.21 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.64 +/- 0.09, P less than 0.025). The intravenous infusion of teprotide, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, led to the return of glomerular plasma flow rate, single nephron filtration fraction, single nephron glomerular filtration rate, efferent arteriolar resistance, and fractional proximal fluid reabsorption in myocardial-infarcted rats to, or toward, the levels found in control rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "307": "This study investigated the ability of angiotensin II (Ang II) to facilitate the stimulation-induced release of [3H]norepinephrine [( 3H]NE) from two cardiovascular regulatory areas in normal and sodium-restricted rats. Ang II (10(-7) M) facilitated the field-stimulation-induced release of [3H]NE from the A2 area of the nucleus tractus solitarius but not from the anterior hypothalamus of Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. Placement of rats on a sodium-restricted diet abolished the facilitation of [3H]NE release due to Ang II. Captopril given during sodium restriction partially restored the facilitory effects of Ang II. In an effort to determine the interaction of Ang II and sodium reduction, the effects of chronic Ang II were studied. Seven-day intravenous Ang II infusions blocked the facilitory effect of Ang II on [3H]NE release in a manner similar to that seen with sodium restriction. These results suggest that low sodium diets may alter the facilitation of [3H]NE release by Ang II by interactions with the renin-angiotensin system.",

A Ki of 1.2 nM was obtained for S 9780 (Dixon-Webb plot) with angiotensin I as a substrate. In rabbits, rats, cats, guinea pigs, and dogs, S 9780 MK 422, S 9490, and MK421 decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, the pressor response to angiotensin I. The rabbit and the rat were the most sensitive species, with ID50 values, respectively, of 2.7 +/- 0.4 and 5.9 +/- 0.3 micrograms/kg i.v. for S 9490 and 1.2 +/- 0.2 and 2.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/kg i.v. for S 9780. S 9490 induced a dose-dependent decrease in serum ACE activity in rabbits (0.6-20 micrograms/kg i.v.) and guinea pigs (10-100 micrograms/kg i.v.). In conscious rats and dogs S 9490 (0.03-1 mg/kg p.o.) induced a long-lasting inhibition of the angiotensin I-induced pressor response; 40% inhibition was recorded in dogs, 24 h after 1 mg/kg p.o.

    "309": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor MK-422 (enalaprilat) was compared with the potent renin inhibitor SCRIP for its ability to improve left ventricular function in closed-chest dogs. Acute left ventricular failure (ALVF) was induced by repeated embolization (EMB) of the left coronary arterial vasculature with 50-micron plastic microspheres. Baseline stability data were obtained in 30 dogs in which the evolution of ALVF was monitored over time. Guided by a progressive rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), a stepwise perturbation of the coronary circulation with microspheres over 30 min caused reductions in left ventricular dP/dt and cardiac output, averaging 47 and 40%, respectively. EMB reduced heart rate (20 beats/min) and mean arterial pressure by approximately 20 mm Hg which, along with other hemodynamic variables remained stable after induction of heart failure. MK-422 (100 micrograms/kg i.v.) given 45 min after ALVF was induced, decreased mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR) from 5,453 to 4,150 dyne X s X cm-5 (p less than 0.05). The decline in LVEDP (from 14 +/- 1 to 11 +/- 1 mm Hg) and TPR suggests that MK-422 dilates resistance and, conceivably, capacitance vessels.

Eighty-eight percent of untreated dogs and 80% of group 1 captopril dogs survived the 24-h duration of the study. No experimental deaths occurred in group 2 captopril dogs. Arterial blood pressure had decreased 10-12 mm Hg in both captopril groups by 4 h and remained relatively stable for the remainder of the study period. In untreated dogs, blood pressure was unchanged for 6 h, then began a gradual decline. There were no significant differences in infarct size among the groups.

Half the rats were given MK421 (300 mg/L) in the drinking water. Parallel groups of rats were fed a standard diet (0.26 mEq Na+/24 h) without MK421. As expected, rats maintained on the low-sodium regimen for either 5 or 21 days had marked stimulation of plasma renin activity and increased angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone formation. When MK421 was added to the drinking water, there was inhibition of angiotensin II formation at 5 days (low sodium, 99.4 +/- 25.8 pg/ml; low sodium + MK421, 26.3 +/- 10.5 pg/ml; p less than 0.02), but angiotensin II formation at 3 weeks was not different from the control group (low sodium, 499 +/- 147 pg/ml; low sodium + MK421, 306 +/- 110 pg/ml).

    "312": "The extent to which cardiac neuroeffector function may be modulated by angiotensin II (AII) generated locally from angiotensin I (AI) was investigated in guinea-pig spontaneously beating isolated atria radiolabelled with [3H]noradrenaline. AI and AII were equipotent in increasing the rate and force of atrial contractions with a threshold concentration between 0.1 and 1.0 nM. In contrast, AI was approximately twenty times less potent than AII in enhancing the stimulation-induced (S-I) efflux of radioactivity. The actions of AI and AII on rate and force of atrial contractions, as well as those on S-I efflux of radioactivity, were substantially blocked by the AII receptor antagonist saralasin. On the other hand, the converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and MK-422 selectively blocked the actions of AI without affecting those of AII. These results suggest that significant local conversion of AI to AII occurs in guinea-pig isolated atria. This locally generated AII can act on myocardial AII receptors to increase rate and force of atrial contractions, and on AII receptors located on sympathetic nerve terminals to facilitate sympathetic neurotransmission. The lower potency of AI compared to AII in modulating transmitter release, in contrast to the equal potency of the peptides in mediating chronotropic and inotropic responses, may be due to conversion of AI to AII at sites remote from the neuroeffector junction.",

The present study examines the chloride dependence of the inhibition of ACE by nine inhibitors [(D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl)-L-Pro (captopril), N-[1(S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-Ala-L-Pro (MK-422), L-Ala-L-Pro, N-(phenylphosphoryl)-L-Phe-L-Phe, Gly-L-Trp, N-[1(S)-carboxy-5-aminopentyl]-L-Phe-Gly, L-Phe-L-Arg, N alpha-(3-mercaptopropanoyl)-L-Arg, and N alpha-[1(S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-Ala-L-Lys] containing structural features characteristic of the three classes of substrates. Apparent Ki values for all inhibitors are markedly (70-250-fold) decreased by 300 mM chloride. However, the enhancement of inhibition is achieved at significantly lower chloride concentrations with those inhibitors having an ultimate arginine or lysine than with the remainder. This variability parallels that previously found for activation of substrate hydrolysis. The effect of chloride on the individual steps in the formation and dissociation of the steady-state enzyme-inhibitor complexes was determined with the slow-binding inhibitor MK-422. Pre-steady-state analysis indicates that binding of both MK-422 and captopril follows a (minimally) two-step mechanism: (formula; see text) in which rapid formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex is followed by a slow isomerization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Inhibition modes, apparent Ki [Ki(app)] values, and shapes of 1/v vs. [I] plots were found to vary with the substrate employed. All inhibitors except Phe-Arg were competitive with the substrate furanacryloyl (Fa)-Phe-Gly-Gly, while five of seven tested with Fa-Phe-Phe-Arg as substrate produced mixed patterns. Ki-(app) values for N-[1(S)-carboxy-5-aminopentyl]-L-Phe-Gly, N-(phenylphosphoryl)-L-Phe-L-Phe, Gly-Trp, and MK-422 were 8.3-, 5.5-, 4.7-, and 2.6-fold lower, respectively, when Fa-Phe-Gly-Gly was substrate, compared with values measured with Fa-Phe-Phe-Arg. In contrast, Ki(app) values for Phe-Arg and (3-mercaptopropanoyl)-Arg were lower (2.8- and 2.2-fold, respectively) when Fa-Phe-Phe-Arg was the substrate. Plots of 1/v vs. [I] for most of the inhibitors were nonlinear, to an extent which was also substrate dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "315": "Enkephalin disappearance during a single passage through the isolated, Krebs'-perfused rat lung was examined by superfusion bioassay. The rat colon was used to quantitate enkephalin disappearance since it proved to be sensitive to physiologic concentrations (10(-11) M) of met5-enkephalin or an analog D-ala2-D-leu5-enkephalin. The rat stomach strip was used to assess the release of prostaglandins from the pulmonary vasculature. The rat lung rapidly degraded the enkephalins but released no prostaglandins in the dose-range of 0.1 - 50 ng. Captopril at doses which blocked conversion of angiotensin I to II inhibited the degradation of enkephalins across the lung.", 
    "316": "Endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11), purified to homogeneity from pig kidney, was shown to hydrolyse a wide range of neuropeptides, including enkephalins, tachykinins, bradykinin, neurotensin, luliberin and cholecystokinin. The sites of hydrolysis of peptides were identified, indicating that the primary specificity is consistent with hydrolysis occurring at bonds involving the amino group of hydrophobic amino acid residues. Of the substrates tested, the amidated peptide substance P is hydrolysed the most efficiently (Km = 31.9 microM; kcat. = 5062 min-1). A free alpha-carboxy group at the C-terminus of a peptide substrate is therefore not essential for efficient hydrolysis by the endopeptidase. A large variation in kcat./Km values was observed among the peptide substrates studied, a finding that reflects a significant influence of amino acid residues, remote from the scissile bond, on the efficiency of hydrolysis. These subsite interactions between peptide substrate and enzyme thus confer some degree of functional specificity on the endopeptidase. The inhibition of endopeptidase-24.11 by several compounds was compared with that of pig kidney peptidyldipeptidase A (EC 3.4.15.1). Of the inhibitors examined, only N-[1(R,S)-carboxy-2-phenylethyl]-Phe-p-aminobenzoate inhibited endopeptidase-24.11 but not peptidyldipeptidase. Captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline), Teprotide (pGlu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro) and MK422 [N-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-Ala-L-Pro] were highly selective as inhibitors of peptidyldipeptidase. Although not wholly specific, phosphoramidon was a more potent inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.11 than were any of the synthetic compounds tested.", 
    "317": "Results of an investigation aimed at identifying the consequences of chemical modifications of the alpha-aminoketone moiety of ketomethyldipeptides on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition are reported. These studies lead to the conclusion that within this series, the optimal structural backbone formulation for inhibition of ACE is represented by 1. Introduction of a Sar-Pro C-terminal dipeptide in this system, in contrast to other inhibitor classes, is compatible with potent inhibitory activity. Other structure-activity relationships for ketomethyldipeptides and related derivatives are presented, and speculations on possible modes of binding of these inhibitors to ACE, and on the question of ketone rehybridization are offered.", 
    "318": "The design rationale for a new series of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors which incorporate a ketone substituent into a peptide backbone is described. Molecular regions which were expected to mimic the binding of an N-acyl tripeptide substrate at secondary binding sites S1 and S1' were systematically varied in order to study the specificity of inhibitor binding and optimize inhibition against ACE. The most effective ketomethyldipeptides inhibit ACE in the 10(-9) M range.", 
    "319": "Renal compensatory mechanisms are a chief consideration when selecting an antihypertensive agent. The relationships, therefore, between renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, sodium handling by the kidney, and release of renin require particular attention. We shall examine therapeutic measures such as beta adrenergic blockers, vasodilators, calcium entry blockers, and converting enzyme inhibitors in light of their effects on renal blood flow.", 
    "320": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are clearly effective treatment for all stages of hypertension. Since the introduction of captopril in 1981, numerous ACE inhibitors have been synthesized and are under investigation. Their exact antihypertensive mechanism of action remains unclear. Part of their effect may be mediated by vasodilator prostaglandins. Early studies with as much as 1,000 mg a day captopril demonstrated the agent's ability to reduce blood pressure, but only 10 percent of the severely hypertensive patients were controlled with monotherapy. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that patients with mild to moderate hypertension can be controlled with ACE inhibitor alone, although there is a tendency for the very low doses to lose their effect with time. Black patients are less readily controlled with monotherapy. Captopril has now been demonstrated to be effective in the hypertension of scleroderma and has reversed scleroderma renal crisis. ACE inhibitors are also effective for the treatment of severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "321": "Acute renal failure has been reported during captopril therapy of hypertension due to renal artery stenosis with a single kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Under low perfusion pressures inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system could disturb the autoregulation, decrease efferent arteriolar resistance and lead to a critical decrease in glomerular filtration. Renal function tests were repeated in a patient with hypertension due to 90 p. 100 renal artery stenosis with a single kidney, before and after captopril administration (sodium intake 100 mmol/24 h). (table; see text) Identical results have also been observed in a patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Both patients presented high risk renal haemodynamic states. The control of systemic blood pressure and the fall in filtration fraction were not associated with a critical, immediate or short term fall in glomerular filtration. The isolated administration of captopril is therefore not systematically contra-indicated in these two clinical situations.", 
    "322": "52 children with renal allograft received captopril during 56 periods of treatment. High blood pressure (BP) was due to renal artery stenosis in 22 patients, to diffuse vascular lesions (mainly due to chronic rejection) in 13, to high-dose corticosteroid treatment in the early phase in 11, and to various or unknown causes in 10 patients. In the last 3 groups (including 34 cases) captopril use did not induce any marked drawback. In the absence of overload, a good control of BP was obtained with a mean dosage of 2.2 mg/kg (0.7----5 mg/kg). A mild, transient renal failure (RF) was observed in 6 patients, who were given diuretics without any need. The 22 patients with renal artery stenosis received captopril during 26 periods of treatment. The mean dosage was 1.6 mg/kg (0.3-4.4). The result was excellent in 12 cases (normal BP without any RF), less good in 8 cases (moderate RF +/- borderline BP) and poor (acute RF) in 6. Sodium depletion, due to diuretics in 9, was present in all 14 cases with RF and in 10 of them captopril could be continued or reintroduced without any reappearance of RF after the correction of salt depletion. We conclude that sodium depletion is the main cause of renal failure in transplanted patients receiving captopril and that avoidance of diuretics largely diminishes the risk of RF.", 
    "323": "The objective of this study was to determine the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin contributions to the control of blood pressure and renal blood flow (RBF) in conscious normotensive and Goldblatt hypertensive dogs. Urapidil (2 mg/kg), an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, and then captopril (0.2 mg/kg) were administered acutely intravenously (i.v.) to instrumented normotensive and two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive dogs. Urapidil decreased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in the hypertensive (n = 11) and normotensive dogs (n = 9). Contralateral RBF was unchanged in the hypertensive, but was increased in the normotensive dogs. Captopril caused a further fall in MAP of the hypertensives and increased RBF. MAP of the normotensives was further decreased and RBF increased by captopril. Urapidil increased plasma renin activity in the normotensives, but not in the hypertensives, whereas heart rate was increased and renal vascular resistance was decreased in both groups. In nine hypertensive dogs, captopril alone (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) had a smaller effect on MAP and RBF than after alpha blockade. These results indicate that the combined influence of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems accounts for a major portion of the MAP increase in two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension, and elimination of their influence causes profound hypotension and renal vasodilatation.", 
    "324": "The effects of intracisternal injection of captopril (0.3 mg/kg) on the pressor responses elicited by afferent stimulation of the vagus were investigated in the anaesthetized dog. The captopril-induced decrease in the systolo-diastolic pressor response to vagal stimulation was reversed by subsequent injection of naloxone (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.). These results suggest the involvement of central opioid mechanisms in the hypotensive properties of captopril.", 
    "325": "The effects of a long-term administration of captopril (Squib 14225) on the rat zona glomerulosa were investigated. Morphometry showed that this drug, which specifically inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme, induces a notable atrophy of zona glomerulosa cells, which is principally due to the decrease in the volume of mitochondrial compartment and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Radioimmunological assays disclosed that in the treated rats the plasma aldosterone concentration is significantly lowered. The suppressive effects of captopril were completely reserved by chronic treatment with angiotensin II. These findings confirm the view that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in the maintenance of the growth and steroidogenic capacity of the normal rat zona glomerulosa.", 
    "326": "The effect on potassium levels of short-term (5-10 days) and \"prolonged\" (4 weeks) captopril therapy were compared. No consistent changes during short-term treatment were found and the elevations in serum potassium associated with prolonged treatment could not be predicted on the basis of short-term changes. However, a definite correlation was found between glucose-induced serum potassium alterations (in the course of glucose tolerance test) during short-term captopril administration and elevations in baseline serum potassium during prolonged treatment In the patients with glucose-induced paradoxical serum potassium elevations, baseline serum potassium levels increased more markedly during prolonged captopril therapy than in patients with the opposite glucose-induced changes.", 
    "327": "To examine the role of endogenous angiotensin II or kinins in the mechanism of the increased renal vascular reactivity to exogenous angiotensin II following acute blood volume expansion, we examined whether captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, can prevent the increase in renal vascular response in anesthetized dogs. Pretreatment of dogs with captopril increased plasma renin activity, but it did not affect systemic blood pressure, renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance. Acute blood volume expansion with saline suppressed plasma renin activity in dogs with or without pretreatment with captopril. Basal level of renal vascular reactivity to angiotensin II was increased by pretreatment with captopril. In the control animals, acute blood volume expansion enhanced renal vascular reactivity to angiotensin II but not norepinephrine. The enhanced renal vascular reactivity to angiotensin II, however, was not prevented by the captopril treatment. The failure of captopril to prevent an increase in renal vascular reactivity to angiotensin II following acute blood volume expansion was associated with an increase in urinary excretion of bradykinin. These data suggest that endogenous angiotensin II level is not necessarily a determinant for vascular reactivity to exogenous angiotensin II, especially in the case of acute blood volume expansion.",

After sample purification on an XAD-2 column, captopril was treated with 1-(7-dimethylamino)-4-methyl-2-oxo-2H -1-benzopyran-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione to form a fluorescent derivative. After acidification, the fluorescent derivative was extracted into toluene and purified on a C18 cartridge. The fluorescence of the dimethyl-formamide eluate was measured at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and a fluorescence wavelength of 440 nm.", 
    "330": "A patient with severe pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary arteriolar obliteration complicating a long standing CREST variant of systemic sclerosis showed improvement in cardiac output and exercise tolerance during treatment with captopril, which was discontinued because of persistent systemic hypotension. It is suggested that captopril would have a useful and possible prophylactic effect early in pulmonary hypertension in systemic sclerosis.", 
    "331": "The effect of inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme by captopril was studied in rats with aortic coarctation produced above the renal arteries. When captopril therapy was started before coarctation, blood pressure above the narrowing and the pressure difference across the coarctation were reduced, compared with values in animals with coarctation not given therapy. When captopril therapy was started 10 days after the coarctation, there was no effect on blood pressure. Plasma renin activity increased 24 hours after coarctation and returned to control levels by 5 days. Captopril caused an increase in renin activity and a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentrations. After 5 days, there was no difference in renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels between animals with coarctation given captopril therapy early and late and between appropriate controls. Our data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is important in the early development but not in the maintenance of coarctation hypertension.",

After seven weeks, BP reduction with each captopril dose was greater than in the placebo group, averaging 10.2 to 14.2/8.6 to 10.5 mm Hg. Captopril, 37.5 mg/day, was as effective as 150 mg/day. Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg twice daily, was added for seven more weeks to all patients receiving placebo and to two thirds of those randomized to captopril therapy. Blood pressure reduction averaged 12.0/8.7 mm Hg in those receiving hydrochlorothiazide alone and 24.9 to 26.4/14.4 to 17.3 mm Hg in those receiving a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and captopril. Added hydrochlorothiazide greatly enhanced the antihypertensive response. The 15 terminations (4.3%) related to captopril were not life threatening.",

    "335": "The effects of captopril in several humoral factors were studied to elucidate the role of the renin-angiotensin (RA) system in arterial and venous pressures and renal function in patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure. A single oral dose of captopril in 20 subjects reduced mean arterial blood pressure from 77 to 67 mm Hg; this decrease correlated with baseline plasma renin activity (PRA). The increase in PRA and the decrease in plasma aldosterone levels after captopril were much greater in subjects with higher PRA. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels decreased, while those of epinephrine did not change. Peripheral venous pressure declined from 107 to 77 mm H2O; this decrease correlated with the change in NE levels. During 7-day captopril therapy, urine volume and sodium excretion increased (1145 to 1136 ml/day and 76 to 94 mEq/day) in 11 subjects in whom renal function was followed. Renal plasma flow (RPF) rose from 237 to 364 ml/min, while glomerular filtration rate did not change; the filtration fraction decreased from 32% to 23%. Simultaneous infusion of aprotinin in six of the subjects did not affect the captopril-induced increase in RPF, despite the suppression of plasma bradykinin levels. These results suggest that captopril reduces arterial blood pressure in patients with high PRA through inhibition of the RA system and dilates veins by attenuation of sympathetic nervous activity. Increased RPF and urinary sodium excretion induced by captopril might result from inhibition of the RA system; the kallikrein-kinin system or bradykinin-mediated prostaglandins do not appear to play a major role.", 
    "336": "To determine the role of local bradykinin at the level of the vascular smooth muscle receptors in the hypotensive effect of captopril, we assessed the effects of prolonged intravenous infusions for up to 7 days of bradykinin (0.1 microgram/min) and captopril (1.7 micrograms/min) on systolic blood pressure and uterine bradykinin receptors in normotensive rats. Bradykinin infusion was associated with a transient fall in systolic blood pressure at Day 1 (117.5 +/- 2.8 mmHg vs. 125.8 +/- 1.7, p less than 0.05) and returned to control levels by Day 3. Following captopril infusion there was a similar but more persistent fall in systolic blood pressure (115.3 +/- 2.4 mmHg vs. 125.8 +/- 1.7, p less than 0.01 at Day 1 and 111.0 +/- 2.4 mmHg vs. 125.0 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.001 at Day7). After 2 days of bradykinin infusion the number of bradykinin receptors was decreased (39.9 +/- 2.1 fmol/mg protein vs. 49. 9 +/- 2.4, p less than 0.01) and returned to controls at Day 7, while captopril infusion induced a prolonged decrease (42.3 +/- 1.8 fmol/mg protein vs. 49.9 +/- 2.4, p less than 0.05 at Day 2 and 38.8 +/- 2.4 fmol/mg protein vs. 44.5 +/- 1.3, p less than 0.05 at Day 7). Present results suggest that the increased vascular tissue level of bradykinin can contribute directly to the acute hypotensive effect of captopril. However, it may play only a minor role for the chronic hypotensive effect of captopril.", 
    "337": "A simple in-vitro enzyme system has been used to demonstrate that human angiotensin I interacts competitively with the two non-thiol converting enzyme inhibitors CGS 13934 and MK-422 to inhibit the hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate by human plasma ACE.", 
    "338": "This study was conducted to investigate the possible involvement of the vascular renin-angiotensin system in the isoproterenol (ISO)-induced facilitation of adrenergic neurotransmission in the mesenteric vasculature. The isolated, perfused mesenteric vascular beds from normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used for these studies. ISO at concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M caused significantly greater enhancement of the pressor response to periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS) in preparations from SHR than in those from WKY. The pressor responses to exogenous norepinephrine (NE) were, however, inhibited by ISO to a similar degree in preparations from both WKY and SHR. The enhancement of the PNS response produced by ISO was markedly attenuated by propranolol at 5 X 10(-7) M (nonselective beta receptor blocker) and by ICI 118,551 at 5 X 10(-7) M (selective beta-2 receptor blocker), whereas practolol at 5 X 10(-6) M (selective beta-1 receptor blocker) caused a potentiation of the ISO-induced enhancement of responses to PNS in preparations from both WKY and SHR. All three beta blockers generally abolished the ISO-induced inhibition of the pressor responses to exogenous NE. The selective beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, salbutamol (3 X 10(-8) to 3 X 10(-7) M) and terbutaline (10(-7) to 3 X 10(-7) M), caused significantly greater enhancement of the PNS response in preparations from SHR than in those from WKY, whereas the selective beta-1 agonist, dobutamine, caused only inhibition of the PNS responses in preparations from both WKY and SHR. These three agonists all tended to reduce the pressor responses to exogenous NE. The ISO-induced enhancement of the responses to PNS was also significantly reduced by either captopril (5 X 10(-6) M) or [Sar1-Ile8]angiotensin II (5 X 10(-7) M) in preparations from SHR. Neither captopril nor [Sar1-lle8] angiotensin II had an effect on the pressor response to NE infusion or on the ISO-induced inhibition of NE responses. Angiotensin I produced an enhancement of the pressor responses to PNS and to NE infusion with the effect being greater on the response to PNS than to NE in the preparations from SHR but not in those from WKY. This enhancement of the PNS response by angiotensin I was abolished by either captopril (5 X 10(-7) M) or [Sar1-Ile8]angiotensin II (5 X 10(-7) M) in preparations from both WKY and SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "339": "Low doses of bradykinin (below 10 nM), as well as of K+ (below 10 mM) induced relaxation, whereas higher doses caused contraction of the rat duodenum. The relaxant responses induced by bradykinin and K+ were not affected by ouabain (1 microM), but pre-incubation with 5.9 mM K+ abolished the responses to that ion but not those to bradykinin. The contractile and relaxant components of the response to bradykinin (but not those to K+) increased with the time elapsed after mounting of the preparation, and this was due to stretching by the load of the recording system. Specific and reversible desensitization (tachyphylaxis) was observed with the contractile response (but not the relaxation) induced by bradykinin. Des-Arg9-bradykinin, an analogue specific for B1-receptors, was much less active than bradykinin, and elicited only a contractile response. Among four bradykinin potentiating peptides that were tested, potentiator C enhanced the relaxation only, whereas BPP5a and captopril potentiated only the contraction and BPP9a potentiated both types of response to bradykinin. Our results support the hypothesis that the relaxant and contractile components of the rat duodenum's response to bradykinin are due to actions at different receptor sites, which can be distinguished by their properties (desensitization) and their different apparent affinities for agonists and for potentiating peptides.", 
    "340": "Primary pulmonary hypertension is an uncommon but serious disease that often results in debilitating symptoms and early death. One approach to treatment has been to attempt reduction of pulmonary arterial pressure and right ventricular afterload by using vasodilator agents to decrease pulmonary arteriolar resistance. Use of a variety of vasodilators has yielded only limited and infrequent success. Although an occasional patient may respond to vasodilator therapy with improved pulmonary hemodynamics and symptomatic status, most patients do not. Reasons for lack of success include the presence of predominantly fixed vascular obstructive disease rather than active vasoconstriction, inexorable progression of disease, and adverse nonpulmonary vascular effects of vasodilators, such as systemic hypotension. Because of occasional beneficial responses, a trial of vasodilators is warranted in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Initiation of drug therapy should be undertaken during hemodynamic monitoring in order to allow assessment of response, identification of adverse effects, and comparison of different agents. No vasodilator is clearly superior in primary pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "341": "The relationship between sodium homeostasis and the renin-angiotensin system was assessed through the use of two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril and enalapril) in the rat. Treatment with captopril (group SQ) or enalapril (group MK) before and during a 6-day period of sodium free diet was associated with sodium wasting; on the sixth day of sodium restriction, sodium excretion was 164 +/- 17 and 144 +/- 10 mumol/24 h in SQ and MK group respectively. In addition, the cumulative Na+ excretion during the 6 day period of sodium-free diet was 1.04 +/- 0.07 mmoles in untreated rats and 1.70 +/- 0.13 and 1.86 +/- 0.14 mmoles in MK and SQ group respectively. At the end of the study, mean arterial pressure was lower in treated than in untreated animals. These findings show that in rats both renal and systemic adaptations to reduced sodium intake are markedly impaired by administration of converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "342": "In the rat model of hypertension induced by a clip on the right renal artery, sparing the left kidney, we compared the efficacity and the endocrine, renal and cardiac effects of classical therapy (CT) of hypertension (Clonidine 0.2 mg/kg and Dihydralazine 15 mg/kg in 2 daily subcutaneous injections and Furosemide 30 mg/kg/day in the drinking water), with inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme with a new drug, the S-9490-3 (0.5 mg/kg in one daily administration). The untreated animals (HT: n = 12) had an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 215 +/- 32 mmHg. After 1 month' treatment, S-9490-3 (n = 13) lowers SBP to 144 +/- 32 mmHg compared to CT (n = 12) which lowered SBP to only 172 +/- 18 mmHg. The average plasma renin concentrations of the HT animals was four times the normal value (39 +/- 33 ng/ml/h) and both treatment regimes increased it further (S-9490-3: 129 +/- 65 ng/ml/h; CT: 97 +/- 73 ng/ml/h). Angiotensin levels fell in proportion to the increase in renin concentration. Plasma aldosterone was normalised by S-9490-3 (460 +/- 320 pg/ml) but remained as high after CT (850 +/- 650 pg/ml) as in the untreated HT animals (830 +/- 260 pg/ml). Despite the Furosemide, plasma volume increased significantly in the CT group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "343": "The influence of renal insufficiency (RI) on the pharmacokinetics of captopril (1 mg/kg, orally) and on the kinetics of the induced converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) was investigated in three groups of hypertensive patients: without RI (n = 10, plasma creatinine less than 100 mumol/l), with moderate RI (MRI) (n = 10,200 less than creatinine less than 400 mumol/l) and with severe RI (SRI) (n = 8, creatinine greater than 500 mumol/l). Captopril pharmacokinetic parameters were not modified by RI, with the exception of elimination half-life which was lengthened, but relative bioavailability of the drug was not modified. In contrast, captopril-induced CEI was strongly potentiated in patients with RI, an effect correlated with plasma creatinine values. This apparent discrepancy between the lack of modification in captopril plasma bioavailability and the prolongation of its biological effects can probably be accounted for by a decreased elimination and/or an increased formation of captopril metabolites during RI.", 
    "344": "The effect of captopril-mediated afterload reduction on regurgitation was investigated in 10 patients with aortic insufficiency. Regurgitation was quantitated by the regurgitation fraction and the relation of regurgitant volume to enddiastolic volume, which were derived from gated radionuclide ventriculography. 19 patients with coronary artery disease and no evidence of valvular heart disease served as controls. In patients with coronary artery disease no significant regurgitation was found. In patients with aortic regurgitation the blood concentration of angiotensin I increased whereas that of angiotensin II decreased significantly after captopril-medication; thus, the conversion of angiotensin I to II was reduced to about 50% of the control value. Whereas blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly, the regurgitation fraction and the normalized regurgitant volume were significantly reduced. The ejection fraction remained essentially unchanged. These findings suggest a favorable influence of captopril-induced afterload reduction on hemodynamics in aortic regurgitation.",

The blood pressure of rats receiving teprotide chronically was reduced markedly. The pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin II was accentuated, while that of noradrenaline and vasopressin were significantly reduced. It is concluded that besides the angiotensin converting enzyme blocking action, the decrease in sensitivity of the pressor response to noradrenaline and vasopressin may contribute towards the antihypertensive activity of teprotide given chronically.", 
    "346": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme and 5'-nucleotidase line the luminal surface of pulmonary microvascular endothelium and participate in the synthesis and/or degradation of potent vasoactive substances. We applied Michaelis-Menten kinetics in simultaneous estimations of apparent constants Km and Amax (product of Vmax and microvascular plasma volume) of these two enzymes for the substrates 3H-labeled benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro and 14C-labeled 5'-AMP, respectively, in vivo. Values of angiotensin-converting enzyme for benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro (Km = 10-11 microM; Amax = 12-13 mumol X min-1) were somewhat higher than published estimates in vitro and changed predictably in response to the known enzyme inhibitor captopril. Kinetic values of 5'-nucleotidase for 5'-AMP (Km = 3-4 microM; Amax = 3-4 mumol/min) were substantially lower than those reported in vitro but also responded predictably to the competitive inhibitor of 5'-nucleotidase, adenosine 5'-[alpha, beta-methylene]diphosphate. These data offer in vivo estimates of enzyme kinetics that are useful in revealing enzyme behavior in their normal physiological environment and provide means of evaluating the action of pharmacological, physiological, and pathological modulators of enzyme activity, in vivo.", 
    "347": "Enalapril, a new long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered orally to 12 patients with stable congestive cardiac failure, NYHA function class III-IV. Acute and chronic hemodynamic effects were evaluated in addition to clinical response. The results of this open pilot study indicated marked reduction of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 21.8 +/- 5.9 mm Hg (mean +/- 1 SD) to 13.3 +/- 4.5 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) and peripheral resistance from 1837 +/- 860 dynes X sec-1 X cm-5 to 1063 +/- 584 dynes X sec-1 X cm-5 at 6 hr (P less than 0.01). Well-tolerated hypotension with mean arterial pressure from 88.0 +/- 11.6 mm Hg to 73.1 +/- 11.7 mm Hg at 6 hr (P less than 0.01) was recorded. No significant increase in cardiac output was observed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was powerfully inhibited at the time of peak hemodynamic effect from 25.3 +/- 9.8 U/ml to 4.9 +/- 3.4 U/ml (P less than 0.01) and sustained, but attenuated reduction at 24 hr (8.7 +/- 4.7 U/ml) was observed. All patients reported subjective improvement and this clinical improvement has been sustained during follow-up from 19 to 21 months although baseline hemodynamic parameters at chronic re-catheterization did not demonstrate significant improvement. The pharmacodynamics and toxicity of enalapril as compared to captopril are discussed. The long half-life, low toxicity and gradual onset of action are seen as representing a clinical advantage with regard to patient therapy.", 
    "348": "Although only recently introduced, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been utilized to treat a wide variety of clinical disorders. Their uses to date, approved by the Food and Drug Administration, have been in the treatment of refractory hypertension and congestive heart failure. However, they have been evaluated with mixed results in numerous other conditions in which the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may play a role. Their current status in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and these other conditions is reviewed.", 
    "349": "To determine the efficacy of converting-enzyme inhibition in patients with low-renin congestive heart failure (CHF), the long-term hemodynamic and clinical responses to captopril were evaluated in 26 consecutive patients with severe, chronic CHF whose pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) was less than 2 ng/ml/hour. After 2 to 8 weeks of continuous treatment with captopril, 14 patients (54%) showed long-term hemodynamic benefits, of whom 13 (50%) improved clinically by at least 1 New York Heart Association functional class. To distinguish responders from nonresponders, patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of sustained reactive hyperreninemia (PRA during chronic therapy greater than 4 ng/ml/hour). After 2 to 8 weeks of therapy with captopril, 14 patients had sustained reactive hyperreninemia. Their cardiac index increased by 0.33 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.01), left ventricular filling pressure decreased by 12.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), mean right atrial pressure decreased by 4.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and systemic vascular resistance decreased by 529 dyne s cm-5 (p less than 0.001). Twelve of these 14 patients improved clinically. Twelve other patients had no reactive increase in PRA, and these patients showed no significant improvement in any hemodynamic variable after 2 to 8 weeks of treatment with captopril; only 1 of the 12 patients improved clinically (p less than 0.001 between groups). The 2 groups were otherwise similar with regard to pretreatment demographic, hemodynamic and hormonal variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "350": "We studied the possible interplay between plasma bradykinin (P-BK) and the renin-angiotensin axis in essential hypertension, the effect of catecholamine on P-BK by standing and norepinephrine (NE) infusion, and the possible role of bradykinin in the hypotensive mechanism of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) in renin-independent essential hypertension. Plasma bradykinin was measured by sensitive radioimmunoassay in 44 hypertensive patients and compared with that of 24 normotensive subjects. P-BK was not significantly reduced in hypertensive patients, and when subjects were divided by age range, the P-BK was reduced by aging in normotensive subjects but not in hypertensive patients, and the elder (60 approximately 80 yr) age normotensive group showed significantly (p less than 0.05) lower P-BK compared with the elder hypertensive group. 28 essential hypertensive patients (EHT) who were classified as WHO stageI (n=15) and WHO stageII (n=13) were given 80 mg of furosemide orally and kept upright for 4 hours. Plasma renin activity (PRA), P-BK, plasma aldosterone (P-Ald) and serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACEA) were measured before and after furosemide administration. Twelve normotensive subjects served as controls. PRA, P-Ald and ACEA showed a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in all groups in response to furosemide. In normotensives, basal P-BK was 11.1 +/- 1.3 pg/ml which increased to 15.6 +/- 1.8 pg/ml (p less than 0.02) after furosemide. These changes of P-BK were in parallel with PRA, P-Ald and ACEA. In the WHO stageI EHT group, baseline P-BK was 9.7 +/- 1.3 pg/ml which increased to 15.6 +/- 1.8 pg/ml (p less than 0.02) and PRA, P-Ald and ACEA showed a similar increase as in normotensives. In the WHO stageII EHT patients, however, P-BK showed only a slight increase from 9.8 +/- 1.0 pg/ml to 12.0 +/- 1.1 pg/ml after furosemide. These changes were smaller either than normotensives or the WHO stageI EHT group. There was a slight but significant correlation between PRA and P-BK in normotensives and in the WHO stageI EHT. There was no correlation between PRA and P-BK in the WHO stageII EHT. The present results do not support the view that there may be a direct linkage between the kallikrein kinin system and the renin angiotensin axis mediated by kininase II or angiotensin converting enzyme in human peripheral blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "351": "To analyse the role of the renin angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of hypertension in Cushing's syndrome ten patients with hypercorticism (five with pituitary hypothalamic dysfunction, three with adrenal adenomas and two with adrenal carcinomas) received a single oral dose of 25 mg captopril. Mean arterial pressure was then determined at short intervals over periods of up to 240 min. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured immediately before the administration of captopril. Eleven patients with severe essential hypertension, who showed a comparable distribution of basal PRA values, served as a control. Patients with elevated basal PRA values (greater than 3 ng/ml X 3 h) showed, both in the subgroup of cases with essential hypertension and in that with Cushing's syndrome, a statistically significant fall (P less than 0.05-P less than 0.001) in mean arterial pressure, the decrease being slightly more pronounced in essential hypertensives. On the other hand patients with normal PRA values (less than or equal to ng/ml X 3 h) exhibited only a minor fall in mean arterial pressure reaching statistical significance (P less than 0.05) only after 60 min (essential hypertension) and 180 min (Cushing's syndrome), respectively. Our results document that in patients with Cushing's syndrome the effect of captopril seems to be determined by the activity of the renin angiotensin system. Thus, in a substantial number of patients with hypercorticism, the renin angiotensin system may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension, whereas in patients with low PRA values other factors like oversecretion of mineralocorticoids may be responsible for the observed blood pressure increases.", 
    "352": "Although the cause of scleroderma remains elusive, pharmacologic advances and increased understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease provide therapeutic options. Therapy usually addresses the fibrotic, vascular, or immunologic alterations, but general measures can be helpful and should not be overlooked.", 
    "353": "The role of the renin system in the maintenance of the elevated systolic blood pressure in isolated systolic hypertension was investigated in 31 patients who received long-term treatment with propranolol (120 mg daily) and in another group of 22 patients with isolated systolic hypertension who received a test dose of captopril (25 or 50 mg). The greatest systolic blood pressure decrease (35 +/- 5 mm Hg) by propranolol occurred in the high-renin group (n = 9), and the smallest decrease (3 +/- 2 mm Hg) in the low-renin group (n = 9), whereas in the normal-renin group (n = 13), systolic blood pressure was decreased by propranolol by 22 +/- 5 mm Hg. For all the propranolol-treated patients, the decrement in the systolic blood pressure by propranolol was related to the control plasma renin activity (r = 0.63, p less than 0.01) and to the concurrent change in plasma renin activity (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001). Captopril decreased the systolic blood pressure by 55 +/- 10 mm Hg in the high-renin group (n = 11) and by 17 +/- 5 mm Hg in the normal-renin group (n = 6), whereas the smallest decrease (12 +/- 5 mm Hg) in systolic blood pressure occurred in the low-renin group (n = 5). In all the captopril-tested patients (n = 22), the decrease in systolic blood pressure by captopril was related to the control plasma renin activity (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that the plasma renin activity value indicates the participation of the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of the elevated systolic blood pressure in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "354": "The time course of various doses of captopril (C) alone, hydrochlorothiazide (H) alone, and C with H was followed in 142 subjects with mild hypertension. Doses of C were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg three times daily or 37.5 mg twice daily and dose of H was 25 mg twice daily. Time-course measurements were made during continuous treatment, with morning dose omitted on the test day. After C alone, diastolic blood pressure (BP) fell to its lowest point 2 to 5 hr and then gradually returned toward baseline. Reductions from levels before treatment were present 13 hr after a dose and there were no significant differences between various doses of C at that time. Systolic BP fell only with the larger doses. When C was combined with H, both systolic and diastolic BP decreased more than with either C or H alone, reaching a nadir at 2 hr. BP remained significantly below levels before treatment for at least 13 hr after dosing. Except for the response to the lowest (12.5 mg) dose, small doses of C alone had the same effect as large doses on both degree and duration of antihypertensive response. Effect was considerably enhanced by addition of a thiazide diuretic.", 
    "355": "Cutaneous reactions associated with captopril treatment occurred in fifteen out of eighty-nine patients (17%). Dose reduction invariably led to improvement of the reaction but later recurrences were frequent (six patients). In four out of the fifteen patients captopril withdrawal ultimately was necessary. Skin tests and in vitro lymphocyte transformation tests with captopril were performed in these fifteen patients and also in nine captopril-treated control patients without adverse reactions. Positive epicutaneous skin tests were observed in five out of the fifteen patients including the four in whom captopril had to be withdrawn, but in none of the controls. Intracutaneous skin tests were positive in ten of the patients with cutaneous reactions and in two control patients. Captopril-induced in vitro lymphocyte transformation occurred in most patients with cutaneous reactions whereas in control patients captopril suppressed the in vitro lymphocyte proliferative response. Skin biopsies revealed histologic changes consistent with lymphocytic vasculitis. We conclude that epicutaneous skin tests with captopril are helpful in predicting the necessity of captopril withdrawal.",

Angioplasty resulted in improvement in BP control and renal function. This is the first report of a successful angioplasty of an aorto-renal saphenous vein bypass. This case also demonstrates the previously described captopril-induced acute renal failure seen in patients with compromised renal perfusion pressure.", 
    "357": "This study in the pithed rabbit with electrically stimulated sympathetic outflow (spinal region, T-8; 3 Hz) was conducted to determine the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to noradrenaline release in vivo. The rate of noradrenaline release (spillover) into the plasma was determined from the endogenous plasma noradrenaline level and the simultaneously determined noradrenaline plasma clearance. In the pithed rabbit, infusion of angiotensin II (0.1 microgram/kg/min i.v.) failed to increase the noradrenaline release rate and only slightly increased blood pressure. On the other hand, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (1 mg/kg i.v.) decreased both blood pressure and the noradrenaline release rate. Bilateral nephrectomy was performed to reduce endogenous angiotensin II formation; and in this case, infusion of angiotensin II markedly increased the noradrenaline release rate and blood pressure, whereas captopril had no effect on either parameter. These results suggest that angiotensin II modulates noradrenaline release in vivo through activation of facilitatory prejunctional angiotensin II receptors, and that in the pithed rabbit these receptors are probably maximally activated by endogenously synthesized angiotensin II. The actions of angiotensin II on noradrenaline release open the possibility that increases in blood pressure in the pithed rabbit--by decreasing renin release via intrarenal baroreceptors and hence decreasing angiotensin II formation--may lead to decreased noradrenaline release. This was investigated using phenylephrine (6 micrograms/kg/min i.v.), a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, and adrenaline (1 microgram/kg/min i.v.), and alpha 1/alpha 2-agonist. Both drugs increased blood pressure and decreased the noradrenaline release rate. After bilateral nephrectomy, the inhibitory effect of phenylephrine on noradrenaline release was abolished, whereas that of adrenaline was maintained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "358": "The mechanism of antihypertensive action of converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors was studied by comparing two compounds of different potency. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were treated orally with the CE inhibitors Hoe498 and MK421 for periods of 2 and 4 weeks. The threshold antihypertensive dose of Hoe498 was below 0.1 mg/kg/day, and of MK421 1 mg/kg/day. Blood pressure was normalized with 10 mg/kg/day Hoe498 and 30 mg/kg/day MK421. The reduction of the pressor responses to intravenous angiotensin I (ANG I), the potentiation of the bradykinin depressor responses, and the decreases of plasma angiotensin II levels or urinary aldosterone excretion were nor correlated to the antihypertensive potency of the drugs. However, following equi-dose treatment (10 mg/kg/day) with both compounds inhibition of tissue CE activity in the vascular wall of the aorta, in the lung, the kidney, and the brain cortex was more marked with Hoe498 than with MK421. Hoe498 also reduced CE activity in the heart, and adrenal gland, and in other brain areas, and attenuated the pressor responses to intracerebroventricularly injected ANG I. Our results provide the first direct evidence for tissue CE inhibition following chronic oral CE inhibitor treatment, and support the contention that inhibition of the enzyme in target organs such as vascular wall, kidney, heart, or brain may be involved in the antihypertensive action of these drugs.", 
    "359": "Effects of captopril on platelet aggregation were studied in 12 essential hypertensive subjects. At the same time, the effects of captopril and angiotensin II on platelet aggregation in vitro were examined in 20 volunteers. A 50-mg oral dose of captopril was administered daily to hypertensive subjects for 2 weeks; the dose was then increased to 100 mg daily for the next 2 weeks. Values of platelet aggregation induced by ADP, epinephrine, collagen, and arachidonic acid before captopril treatment were 71.9 +/- 4.5, 77.3 +/- 4.2, 72.4 +/- 4.1, and 70.8 +/- 4.3% (mean +/- SE), respectively. Two weeks after daily administration of 50 mg captopril, these values were 56.7 +/- 4.5, 50.8 +/- 7.6, 64.0 +/- 4.6, and 60.9 +/- 3.9%, respectively, with significant reduction of platelet aggregation (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, and p less than 0.005, respectively). Daily administration of 100 mg captopril also had a significant suppressive effect on platelet aggregation. Changes of platelet count and serum lipids were not significant. In vitro, captopril and angiotensin II added to platelet-rich plasma had no effect on platelet aggregation. These results show that the suppressive effect of captopril on platelet aggregation is a secondary action in vivo.",

Plasma renin concentration increased with MK 447 in the normotensive but not the hypertensive sheep. In the normotensive sheep cardiac output fell, peripheral resistance increased and blood pressure was unchanged.

    "363": "The role of each enkephalin-hydrolyzing peptidase in the inhibitory potency of exogenously added enkephalins in the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle preparation of guinea-pig ileum was studied by using the relatively specific inhibitor of each enzyme. Results showed that three distinct enzymes, bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase(s), angiotensin converting enzyme, and thiorphan-sensitive \"enkephalinase\", played a critical role in the inactivation of enkephalins. Additionally, these enzymes are likely to be located close to opioid receptors, since they produce a significant concentration difference of enkephalin between the surrounding organ bath and the vicinity of opioid receptors. In contrast to these three enzymes, both L-tyrosyl-L-tyrosine-sensitive dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and D-phenylalanine-sensitive carboxypeptidase are indicated not to be involved significantly in the degradation of exogenously added enkephalins in the guinea-pig ileum.",

In the nonbinephrectomized animal, captopril and enalapril reduced to the same extent the systemic blood pressure and renal and hindlimb vascular resistances. They also decreased to the same extent systemic pressor and regional vasoconstrictor responses to cirazoline and UK-14,304, especially in the renal and mesenteric vascular beds. Simultaneously, the effects of angiotensin I and angiotensin II on the pressor response were abolished and almost not modified. In the binephrectomized animals, captopril and enalapril no longer reduced the systemic blood pressure and regional vascular resistances, but whereas the sympathoinhibitory effect of captopril vs the systemic pressor and regional vasoconstrictor responses to cirazoline and UK-14,304 persisted, those of enalapril disappeared.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "366": "The effects of captopril, 3 and 10 mg/kg, on vascular noradrenergic transmission were examined in vivo in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). These experiments were performed on mesenteric vascular beds perfused in situ. In WKY, 3 mg/kg captopril failed to significantly lower mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and also failed to have a significant effect on the frequency-response curve to sympathetic nerve stimulation or dose-response curve to norepinephrine (NE) in the mesentery of WKY. In SHR mesentery, 3 mg/kg captopril failed to alter the frequency response curve or NE dose-response curve, while it significantly lowered MAP. The higher dose of captopril, 10 mg/kg, also failed to lower MAP in WKY mesentery, although it caused some reduction in pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and NE. In SHR mesentery, 10 mg/kg captopril significantly lowered MAP and reduced pressor responses to both nerve stimulation and NE. It should be noted, however, that captopril lowered responses to nerve stimulation and NE to a similar degree in both SHR and WKY, and there was no indication of a prejunctional action on vascular noradrenergic transmission. In conclusion, although captopril was more effective in lowering MAP in SHR than in WKY, no evidence was found for significantly greater facilitation of vascular sympathetic neurotransmission by endogenous angiotensin II in SHR than in WKY, and most of the actions of captopril on vascular neurotransmission appeared to be postjunctional in nature and unrelated to either the renin-angiotensin system or the kallikrein-kinin system.", 
    "367": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, given to rats in their drinking water (about 40 mg/day) for 6 days caused an increase in intake of hypertonic NaCl solution which began 1-2 days after the captopril was started and reached a plateau after 4-5 days. Twice-daily subcutaneous injections of captopril (15 mg per injection) elicited a sodium appetite similar in pattern to that seen with oral administration. The rats remained in sodium and fluid balance during oral captopril treatment and the haematocrit did not alter. Captopril infused directly into the ventricles (12 micrograms/h), or captopril reaching the brain from the periphery across a leaky blood-brain barrier, suppressed the sodium appetite which normally follows oral captopril. Continuous intravenous infusion of captopril at rates high enough to block angiotensin converting enzyme in the brain (25, 50 or 500 mg/day) did not cause sodium appetite. As soon as the rate was reduced to a low value (5 mg/day), NaCl intake increased. In conclusion, moderate levels of circulating captopril which do not cross the blood-brain barrier in sufficient amounts to block cerebral angiotensin converting enzyme, result in an increase in circulating angiotensin I which stimulates sodium appetite when it is converted to angiotension II in the brain.", 
    "368": "Preadaptation of adult rats to hypoxia (10% O2 for 5 days) results in tolerance to oxygen-induced lung injury (greater than 95% O2 for 2 days). This study investigated whether hypoxia preadaptation maintained an endothelial cell metabolic function, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, despite exposure to hyperoxia. Lung ACE activity was measured as the capacity of isolated, ventilated, perfused lungs to hydrolyze an ACE substrate, benzoyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-proline (BPAP), after in vivo hypoxia, hyperoxia, or sequential hypoxia-hyperoxia exposure. The results indicated that (1) hyperoxia decreases BPAP hydrolysis in isolated lungs, (2) hypoxia preadaptation does not affect BPAP hydrolysis (measured at ambient PO2), and (3) hypoxia preadaptation prevents hyperoxia-induced depression of lung ACE activity. These data imply that lung microvascular endothelial cells participate in the development of oxygen tolerance in this model.", 
    "369": "Three series of bidentates bearing an hydroxamic or an N-Acyl-N-hydroxy amino group on structures related to Phe-Gly or Phe-Ala exhibit strong inhibitory potency against purified enkephalinase with IC50 values in the 4 to 15 nM range. As with thiol-containing inhibitors, such as thiorphan, the most active compounds are those in which a methylene spacer separates the benzyl P1' moiety from the Zn coordinating residue. Formation of a bidentate complex with the metal enzyme is clearly demonstrated by a loss of potency of three order of magnitude following the removal of one component of the bidentate group. All the compounds studied are unable to interact with angiotensin converting enzyme (IC50 greater than 10,000 nM). Moreover, compounds of the general formula HONHCO-CH2-CH(CH2 phi)-CONH-CH(R)-COOH belonging to the most active series of enkephalinase blockers (IC50 approximately 4 nM) behave also as highly potent and competitive inhibitors (IC50 approximately 10 nM) of a Tyr-Gly releasing dipeptidylaminopeptidase purified from rat brain. The pure steroisomer [(R)-3-(N-hydroxy)carboxamido-2-benzylpropanoyl]-L-alanine designated kelatorphan, exhibits also a relatively good inhibitory potency against aminopeptidases (IC50 approximately 10 microM) and can be considered as the first virtually complete inhibitor of enkephalin metabolism. This very interesting property of inhibiting all three enzymes of enkephalin metabolism could enhance the required selectivity for a possible clinical use of these inhibitors as new analgesic and psychoactive drugs.", 
    "370": "Among the many generic classes of drugs currently being used for the treatment of hypertension, few, following long-term therapy, improve or correct the underlying renal function and hemodynamic abnormalities encountered in patients with sustained hypertension. This review focuses on the renal effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril. Each drug is discussed in terms of its short- and long-term effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renal function and hemodynamics, salt and water excretion, and body fluid composition. Data are presented that demonstrate that enalapril, used alone or in combination with diuretic therapy, has the unique ability to control hypertension, to improve glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma/renal blood flow, and to decrease renal vascular resistance, without producing adverse effects on salt and water excretion or body fluid composition. If the safety of enalapril is confirmed in long-term studies, the drug will clearly assume a prominent role as either first- or second-step (in combination with a diuretic) therapy in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "371": "Renin profiling stimulated research into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension and influenced the development of antihypertensive treatment strategies. Patients with a high renin value and usually younger age respond better to drugs that interfere with the renin-angiotensin system, that is, beta blockers or converting enzyme inhibitors. Patients with a low renin value and often older age respond better to calcium entry blockers or diuretics. Patients with normal renin levels exhibit mixed but, on average, equal responses to these types of drugs. A pathophysiology-oriented antihypertensive treatment strategy is proposed in which beta blockers or converting enzyme inhibitors are used as one and calcium entry blockers--in the place of diuretics when possible--as the other baseline drug, and this approach may provide a cardiac-protective effect.", 
    "372": "To judge the efficacy of converting enzyme inhibitors in the management of congestive heart failure, it is necessary to interpret this in the context of the factors that stimulate renin release and the subsequent formation of angiotensin and aldosterone. The pharmacologic properties of individual converting enzyme inhibitors must be considered, and the alterations in both renin angiotensin activity and long-term converting enzyme inhibition that interact in complementary or offsetting ways to influence the long-term therapeutic result must be understood.", 
    "373": "The effects of enalaprilat (MK-422), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, were compared to those of SCRIP, a renin inhibitor, in experimentally induced left ventricular failure. In anesthetized dogs, acute left ventricular failure was induced by repeated embolization, via the left main coronary artery, with 50 microns plastic microspheres. Embolization significantly increased left ventricular enddiastolic pressure from 6 +/- 1 to 14 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05) mm Hg and decreased both left ventricular maximal dP/dt (3,135 +/- 338 to 1,636 +/- 126 mm Hg/second, p less than 0.05) and cardiac output (3.0 +/- 0.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.1 liters per minute, p less than 0.05). Embolization also significantly reduced heart rate and mean arterial pressure. These parameters remained stable after induction of heart failure. Forty-five minutes after embolization, 16 dogs received enalaprilat (100 microns/kg intravenously) and six dogs received SCRIP (100 microns/kg intravenously followed by 10 microns/kg per minute). Both agents caused similar reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (21 percent versus 26 percent) and total peripheral resistance (25 percent versus 32 percent) and rise in peak positive cardiac contractility, as measured by (dP/dt)/P, (12 percent versus 11 percent). The data suggest that inhibition of angiotensin II formation by two agents, each or which acts at a different point in the cascade, results in similar beneficial hemodynamic effects in dogs with acute left ventricular failure. In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition failed to further increase sodium excretion and glomerular filtration rate caused by embolization. In summary, inhibition of angiotensin II production by two different inhibitors of the renin system causes an improvement in left ventricular performance in a model of acute experimental left ventricular failure.", 
    "374": "The converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, in single daily doses of 10 to 40 mg, was given to 20 hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis. The decrease in blood pressure six hours after the first dose of enalapril was significantly related to the pretreatment plasma concentrations of active renin and angiotensin II, and to the concurrent decrease in angiotensin II. Blood pressure decreased further with continued treatment; the long-term decrease was not significantly related to pretreatment plasma renin or angiotensin II levels. At three months, 24 hours after the last dose of enalapril, blood pressure, plasma angiotensin II, and converting enzyme activity remained low, and active renin and angiotensin I high; six hours after dosing, angiotensin II had, however, decreased further. The increase in active renin during long-term treatment was proportionately greater than the increase in angiotensin I; this probably reflects the diminution in renin substrate that occurs with converting enzyme inhibition. Long-term enalapril treatment increased renin secretion by more than 10-fold, and renal venous and peripheral plasma renin concentration by more than 20-fold; however, the mean renal venous renin ratio was not changed. Enalapril caused a reduction in effective renal plasma flow via the affected kidney but a marked and consistent increase on the contralateral side, where renal vascular resistance decreased. The overall increase in effective renal plasma flow was significantly related to the decrease in angiotensin II. Overall glomerular filtration rate was lowered, and serum creatinine and urea increased. Enalapril alone caused a long-term reduction in exchangeable sodium, with slight but distinct increases in serum potassium. In five patients with bilateral renal artery lesions, enalapril given alone for three months did not cause renal function to deteriorate. Enalapril was well tolerated and provided effective long-term control of hypertension; only two of the 20 patients studied required concomitant diuretic treatment.", 
    "375": "Overall, the worldwide experience on enalapril to date is very encouraging. The drug produces good to excellent responses in 54 to 66 percent of patients with essential hypertension and is at least as effective as either diuretics or beta blockers. The effects of enalapril compared with those of diuretics confirm that patients more dependent upon the renin-angiotensin system respond better. When hydrochlorothiazide is administered concomitantly with enalapril, almost all patients respond, with good long-term maintenance. In patients with severe hypertension, Blocadren or Aldomet may be added in addition to hydrochlorothiazide and will produce additional benefit. Enalapril attenuates the adverse metabolic effects of hydrochlorothiazide, particularly hypokalemia. Overall, although the efficacy of enalapril and that of captopril are similar, enalapril is better tolerated and does not appear to be associated with any significant occurrence of captopril-type side effects, particularly the skin rash and loss of taste. As expected, enalapril and other converting inhibitors may be associated with azotemia in patients with bilateral renovascular hypertension.", 
    "376": "The new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (MK-421), was given in a single daily dose of 20 mg to 53 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Its effects were compared with those of a placebo given to 47 patients on a double-blind randomized basis. The blood pressure was measured in all patients by a physician, using a mercury sphygmomanometer, and by an automatic device in the absence of the physician. After 15 days of treatment, enalapril induced a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (161.4 +/- 13 versus 145.1 +/- 15, p less than 0.001) and in diastolic blood pressure (103.3 +/- 6 versus 92.9 +/- 8, p less than 0.001) measured by the physician. The magnitude of the fall in blood pressure was identical after 30 days of active treatment. The reduction in blood pressure induced by enalapril was similarly detected by both methods of measurement, despite the fact that blood pressure values were higher when measured by the physician. A placebo effect was observed with the physician's values that was not present with the automatically recorded values. A very significant correlation between blood pressure values obtained by these two methods was observed. However, among nine of 53 patients treated with enalapril, a difference in the decrease of blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more was noted between the two methods of measurement. The decrease in blood pressure occurred with no change noted in the pulse rate or orthostatic hypotension. Plasma renin activity increased after treatment. No changes were observed in creatinine clearance and plasma electrolyte levels.", 
    "377": "Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, the active hormone of the renin-angiotensin system. This inhibition leads to a reduction in angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction and aldosterone production. Although converting enzyme inhibitors have other potential metabolic effects, their beneficial effects in hypertension and congestive heart failure appear to be, in large part, related to their ability to reduce angiotensin II. This causes an increase in plasma renin levels and a fall in plasma and urine aldosterone, which can be sustained for many years. As a consequence, converting enzyme inhibitors produce mild natriuresis and positive potassium balance. At conventionally used doses, enalapril more completely prevents posture-induced increases in aldosterone than does captopril, probably reflecting more complete inhibition of angiotensin II formation in vivo.", 
    "378": "A membrane fraction from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata hydrolyses the Gly3-Phe4 bond of [D-Ala2, Leu5]enkephalin as well as the Gly-His bond of benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu. The hydrolysis of benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu is completely inhibitable by Captopril (I50 = 19nM), consistent with peptidyl dipeptidase activity, but enkephalin hydrolysis is inhibited to a maximum of only 70%. The residual activity hydrolysing enkephalin is inhibited by phosphoramidon (I50 = 15nM) and therefore resembles endopeptidase-24.11, a mammalian plasma-membrane enzyme implicated in the metabolism of neuropeptides. Both enkephalin-hydrolysing activities in Torpedo electric organ are inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, like their mammalian counterparts. The peptidases may function in the hydrolysis of endogenous peptides or in neurotransmitter exocytosis in the electric organ.", 
    "379": "An enzyme present in mouse brain cytosol cleaves C-terminal dipeptides from substrates including ACTH-(7-10) (Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly), and des-Tyr-[Met]- and des-Tyr-[Leu]enkephalin. By means of ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration, the peptidase was purified to a specific activity of 1570 times that of brain homogenate. At this purification, a second peptidase, which hydrolyzes Trp-Gly and other peptides [M. E. A. Reith and A. Neidle (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 90, 794-800] was still present, but could be removed by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The des Tyr-enkephalin-cleaving enzyme has a molecular weight of about 85,000 and a pH optimum of 7.8. It is inhibited by metal-chelating and sulfhydryl reagents. The enzyme has a strong preference for substrates with an aromatic residue in the position adjacent to the C-terminal amino acid, although some peptides meeting this criterion were competitive inhibitors rather than substrates. Peptides with less than four residues were inactive and, in general, tetrapeptides were found to be more reactive than larger analogs, when peptides with common C-terminal sequences were compared. The peptidyl dipeptidase, which has not been described previously, can be readily distinguished from angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) and from neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) by its subcellular localization, substrate specificity, and response to inhibitors. It was suggested that peptidyl dipeptidase-B (PDP-B, EC 3.4.15.-) would be an appropriate name for the enzyme. PDP-B is widely distributed among mouse tissues.", 
    "380": "Intracarotid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) infusions (10 ng X kg-1 X min-1) increased arterial pressure in conscious dogs, sheep, and calves. Total and regional peripheral resistances (renal, superior mesenteric, and iliac) increased in conscious calves. Arterial pH and CO2 tension did not change, implying no activation of the chemoreflex. The arterial baro-reflex was reset upward during intracarotid PGE2 infusion; arterial pressure increased with little heart rate change, but baroreflex sensitivity was unchanged. In contrast, equipotent intracarotid angiotensin II infusions (10 ng X kg-1 X min-1) both reset the baroreflex upward and decreased baroreflex sensitivity. Pretreatment with alpha-, but not beta-, adrenoceptor blocking agents attenuated the intracarotid PGE2 pressor effect. Increasing PGE2 infusions (10-200 ng X kg-1 X min-1) caused dose-related arterial pressure increases; plasma renin activity was increased only at the largest infusion rate. Pretreatment with captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, attenuated the PGE2 pressor effect. During barbiturate-halothane and chlorolose-urethan anesthesia, no pressor effect was observed during intracarotid PGE2. We conclude that intracarotid PGE2 acts centrally to augment sympathetic vasomotor outflow. The central action of PGE2 is not affected by activation of the arterial chemoreflex or alteration of baroreflex sensitivity and has a small renin-angiotensin component."
