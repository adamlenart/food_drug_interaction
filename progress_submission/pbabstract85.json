    "0": "The effect of captopril has been investigated in four patients with Bartter's syndrome treated for 12 weeks. Baseline biochemistry showed normal serum aldosterone (mean 347 pmol.l-1) and a mean serum renin of 217 mU-l-1, and a considerable increase in serum renin during captopril treatment. Serum aldosterone decreased gradually during the study period to about half its initial value. The patients presented with a mean serum potassium of 2.5 mmol.l-1, which rose to 3.4 mmol.l-1 on captopril. Lymphocytes showed a substantial captopril-induced increase in intracellular sodium (from 15 to 22.5 mmol.l-1 on average), but no change in the potassium content. Captopril was well-tolerated. It may be an alternative to potassium-sparing diuretics for maintaining normal serum potassium levels in patients with Bartter's syndrome.", 
    "1": "Blood pressure follows a strong circadian rhythm in normotensive people and in patients with primary hypertension. This may have several implications for antihypertensive therapy, including the time of dosing. For this reason we studied the influence of different dosing times on the antihypertensive effect over 24 h using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). We studied 13 male patients with moderate hypertension with controlled blood pressure over 12 months under a fixed combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. The dosage of the combination therapy was then halved and given as one evening and then as one morning dose, each for 3 weeks. The combination therapy given twice daily showed a good 24-h antihypertensive effect after 12 months of treatment. During the following 6 weeks the mean 24-h blood pressure did not increase under half dosage, irrespective of whether under evening or morning dosing. However, mean daytime values (systolic and diastolic) of ABPM were significantly higher with evening dosing when compared both with full dosage and with half dosage given in the morning. The mean arterial blood pressure over 24 h showed the same differences as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, whereas heart rate was not significantly different between the three therapeutic regimens. ABPM seems to be an ideal method for chronopharmacological investigations under everyday conditions. Our study demonstrated significant differences in daytime blood pressure but not in 24-h blood pressure between morning and evening dosing of a fixed antihypertensive combination therapy.", 
    "2": "Five patients (median age 63 years) with severe crescentic glomerulonephritis had acute renal failure (median plasma creatinine 930, range 690-1390). Following induction of immunosuppressive treatment all patients achieved recovery of adequate renal function (median creatinine 440, range 290-570 mumol/l). After 3-6 months of continuous remission, all patients, despite stable renal function developed increasing proteinuria (median 4.4 g/24 h, range 3.2-6.1), and enalapril (5-20 mg per day) was substituted or introduced as antihypertensive therapy. Immunosuppression was not altered. After 1 year, renal function remained stable in four patients and plasma creatinine increased initially in one patient before becoming stable: proteinuria was reduced substantially in all patients to a median of 0.8 g/24 h, range 0.2-1.3). Patients with severe crescentic glomerulonephritis may develop persistent or increasing proteinuria despite successful treatment of acute disease. We have used enalapril to reduce proteinuria and maintain function in such patients.", 
    "3": "Poisoning is a significant problem in the elderly. The majority of poisonings in older people are unintentional and may result from dementia and confusion, improper use of the product, improper storage or mistaken identities. Depression is also common in the elderly and suicide attempts are more likely to be successful in this age group. The elderly patient's recuperative abilities may be inadequate as a result of numerous factors including impaired hepatic or renal function as well as chronic disease processes. General management of poisoning in the elderly parallels management of younger adults, but it is especially important to ascertain underlying medical conditions and concurrent medications. In most poisonings, activated charcoal and cathartic are sufficient. Haemodialysis or haemoperfusion may be required at lower plasma drug concentrations in elderly patients. While the specific indications for antidotes are the same for all age groups, dosage alterations and precautions may need to be considered in the elderly. Drugs most often implicated in poisonings in the elderly include psychotherapeutic drugs, cardiovascular drugs, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycaemics and theophylline. Cardiovascular and neurological toxicities occur with overdoses of neuroleptic drugs and, more frequently and severely, with cyclic antidepressants. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are at particular risk of worsening ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. Benzodiazepines only appear to produce significant toxicity during long term administration or in combination with other CNS depressants. Digoxin can cause both chronic and acute intoxication, most seriously cardiac toxicity including severe ventricular arrhythmias, second or third degree heart block or severe refractory hyperkalaemia. Immune Fab antibody is indicated for the management of digoxin toxicity, although patients dependent on the inotropic effect of digoxin may develop heart failure after digoxin Fab antibody administration. Nitrates can cause toxicity including headache, vomiting, hypotension and tachycardia from excessive sublingual, transdermal or intravenous doses. Conduction disturbances and hypotension occur with overdoses of antihypertensive drugs; these effects are mild with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, occasionally severe with beta-blockers and of significant concern with calcium channel antagonists. The elderly commonly use aspirin and other salicylates, are more likely to develop chronic intoxications to these agents, and are more susceptible to severe complications such as pulmonary oedema. Salicylate poisoning, recognition of which is often delayed, should be considered in elderly patients with neurological abnormalities or breathing difficulties, especially in the setting of acid-base abnormalities. The clinical effects of NSAID overdose are mild and usually involve the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "4": "We have studied the acute and chronic effects of an ACE inhibitor (captopril) on platelet function and the renin-angiotensin system in patients with congestive heart failure. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin II fell significantly after a single dose of captopril (25 mg) and during long-term treatment with captopril (2 weeks, 75 mg/day). Plasma renin activity increased significantly after both the single and repeated doses. Captopril did not affect ADP-induced platelet aggregation or concentrations. It seems unlikely that circulating angiotensin II affects ADP-induced platelet aggregation in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "5": "We studied blood pressure response, plasma renin activity (PRA) and captopril pharmacokinetics in 8 children receiving orally 0.7 mg/kg of the drug. The drug increased PRA in all patients, in 5 to abnormally high levels. Peak captopril concentrations were achieved between half an hour and 2 h, and ranged between 100 and 547 ng/ml. Mean elimination half-time (T1/2) was 1.5 h, ranging between 0.98 and 2.3 h. There was a significant positive correlation between the area under the curve (AUC) and elimination T1/2 of the drug. There was a significant inverse correlation between AUC or elimination T1/2 and percent change in diastolic blood pressure; the 2 children who had no change in diastolic blood pressure had the largest AUC and the lowest apparent clearance of captopril. The kidney is the major site of captopril's pharmacological action. It is possible that longer retention of captopril in the plasma, evidence by larger AUC, may reflect less captopril available to modulate renin activity in the kidney.", 
    "6": "Morphometric studies conducted on the blood vessels of the spontaneously hypertensive rat have provided evidence that medial hypertrophy is a key characteristic of the vascular change which occurs in hypertension. In the present study, we determined whether 3-methylhistidine (3MH), a post-translationally modified amino acid which is found uniquely in the actin and myosin of muscle, could provide a biochemical marker of such change. Our results indicated that the concentrations of 3MH were selectively elevated in the blood vessels from the spontaneously hypertensive rat, when compared with concentrations in vascular tissues from the Wistar-Kyoto rat. The concentrations of 3MH in non-vascular tissues were similar in the two strains. Chronic captopril treatment prevented the development of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat and was associated with a reduction of the vascular concentrations of 3MH. We therefore conclude that blood vessel concentrations of 3MH are a useful biochemical index of the changes in vascular smooth muscle contractile protein which occur during the development of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.", 
    "7": "Attempts at treating idiopathic cardiomyopathy have been made both clinically and experimentally using the cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster. In recent years, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has attracted considerable attention as an agent to treat heart failure. We administered the ACE inhibitor captopril to the cardiomyopathic hamster. In this study, 15 mg/kg body weight of captopril was administered to the cardiomyopathic hamster J2N at 5 weeks of age for 10 weeks; age matched J2N hamsters were used as non-treated control animals. At the end of captopril administration, blood was collected from the ventral aorta. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), serum CPK, aldolase and LDH were determined, and myosin isoenzyme patterns of the extirpated myocardium were compared. Additionally, ECGs were compared and the fibrotic ratio of both ventricles determined. Serum MDA, CPK, and aldolase increased significantly in the cardiomyopathic hamster, whereas these indices were significantly inhibited in the hamster treated with captopril. The pathological ECG findings and the ventricular V3 predominant myosin isoenzyme patterns of the J2N were also much improved in the captopril group. However, the improvement in these parameters by enalapril administration was less than that seen with captopril. These results suggested that the effect of captopril is not only due to decrease of the angiotensin II level, but also due to increase in tissue kinin and vasodilatory prostaglandin which play an important role in the beneficial effect of captopril.", 
    "8": "The effect of captopril on the aldosterone response to potassium was studied in 6 patients with idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia (IAH) and in 4 patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), who all have suppressed activity of circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Precaptopril, KCl infusion induced a significant increase in aldosterone in both groups. This increment was significantly blunted by captopril in IAH, but not in APA. Decreased potassium-stimulated aldosterone secretion after captopril in IAH supports the hypothesis that adrenal RAS plays a role in aldosterone production under potassium stimulation.", 
    "9": "M-SHRSP rats appear to be a useful animal model for studying juvenile human malignant hypertension. Using M-SHRSP, the present study was conducted. Drugs selected for use were captopril, SQ 29,852 and hydralazine hydrochloride. The rats were also fed a 33% fish meal diet. When given separately, all three drugs were shown to be anti-hypertensive. However, using the fish meal diet combined with hydralazine was more effective than were any of the drugs given separately, while the effect of hydralazine combined with captopril or SQ 29,852 was even greater than that of the combined fish meal diet and hydralazine treatment. Some rats treated with captopril or SQ 29,852 separately were resistant to treatment, however even for these rats life spans were significantly prolonged and hypertensive vascular lesion incidence rates were drastically lowered. It was also found that even such vascular lesions as angionecrosis seemed to disappear with captopril or SQ 29,852 treatment.", 
    "10": "The effects of lifetime captopril treatment on vasopressin (VP) were assessed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Pregnant and nursing dams were treated with oral Captopril (100 mg/kg/day). After weaning, the pups were maintained on Captopril (50/kg/day) for 19-20 wks. Blood pressures of Captopril-treated SHR were in the normotensive range and significantly lower (p less than .001) than SHR control rats. Control and Captopril-treated SHR were perfused and brains were sectioned for immunohistochemical staining with a polyclonal antibody directed against vasopressin (VP). Compared to control SHR, Captopril-treated rats displayed decreased VP-like immunoreactivity in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus. Captopril treatment also selectively decreased the number of brightly labeled cell bodies in the SON and PVN and reduced VP-like labeling in the axons of the neurons in these nuclei. Concurrent with a decrease in VP-like immunoreactivity, Captopril treatment reduced plasma VP levels (RIA) (p less than 0.01, Captopril, 5.6 +/- 0.5 pg/ml; control, 11.8 +/- 2.2 pg/ml). Scatchard analysis of 3H-VP binding indicated that Captopril treatment increased the number but not the affinity of VP receptors in the hypothalamus and brain stem of SHR. These results suggest that in SHR oral Captopril treatment attenuates the synthesis and release of VP, an effect that may contribute to the blood pressure lowering effect of converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "11": "T cell function tests were performed in 6 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (EH) before and after treatment with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Total T and T cell subsets were within normal range and were not affected by the drug. The response of PBL to lectin stimulation was significantly impaired. While the stimulation index (SI) was almost normal when washed PBL were used (32.2 +/- 6.90 with PHA and 20.17 +/- 4.1 with Con A) or after their incubation with serum taken from normal subjects (40.42 +/- 10.9 and 15.53 +/- 3.4, respectively), autologous serum significantly reduced the SI (15.04 +/- 5.9 with PHA, p less than 0.05 and 6.68 +/- 1.45 with Con A, p less than 0.005). While captopril seemed to suppress the SI of washed PBL after 1 week of treatment, it enhanced the SI from 32.21 +/- 6.91 to 55.32 +/- 10.76 for PHA and from 20.17 +/- 4.13 to 30.63 +/- 5.41 for Con A (p less than 0.001). This effect was more obvious when the stimulations were performed with normal serum (from 40.42 +/- 10.9 to 96.47 +/- 17.51 for PTH and from 15.53 +/- 3.43 to 40.02 +/- 8.0 for Con A, (p less than 0.001). These results confirm previous reports indicating that the cellular immune response is impaired in EH. It seems that an inhibitory factor found in the serum of these patients is responsible for this impairment. Our findings may suggest that this factor may be angiotensin II.", 
    "12": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on blood pressure, proteinuria, creatinine clearance and metabolic control in diabetic nephropathy have been evaluated. Captopril 144 mg per day was given to 8 longstanding, insulin-dependent, diabetic females with nephropathy. The blood pressure was significantly reduced (systolic 45.4, diastolic pressure 30.6 and mean arterial pressure 33.8 mm Hg after 24 weeks of treatment). Plasma renin activity rose significantly from a basal value of 1.60 to 6.71 ng.ml-1.h-1, and so did serum potassium (from 4.57 to 4.83 mEq.1-1). Serum aldosterone fell from 161 to 70.9 pgm.ml-1 and from 27.3 to 15.3 micrograms.24 h-1 in plasma and urine, respectively, after 6 months on captopril therapy. Urinary protein excretion was decreased by about 48% and creatinine clearance remained unchanged throughout the study. Plasma triglycerides and cholesterol also remained unchanged, and glycosylated haemoglobin was significantly reduced from 13.8 to 10.2% after captopril. The results suggest that captopril is a useful drug to treat hypertension in patients suffering from diabetic nephropathy, as the decline in kidney function can be reduced without impairing glucose tolerance or the lipid profile.", 
    "13": "Low-dose intravenous nitroglycerin infusion for the first 48 h is becoming routine in the management of acute myocardial infarction in North America. It is most widely used as primary therapy in patients admitted more than 6 h after acute infarction. Such therapy has been shown to limit infarct size, infarct complications and remodeling. However, it is being applied increasingly more as an adjunct before, during and after thrombolytic therapy. Several trials are underway to test the effectiveness of more prolonged therapy, with early intravenous nitroglycerin followed by buccal or oral formulations for several weeks, in further limitation of ventricular remodeling, dilatation, aneurysm formation and in preserving function. Nitrates may prove to be a useful adjunct or alternative to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for long-term therapy.", 
    "14": "Hyperlipidemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and probably contributes to the increased cardiovascular mortality following renal transplantation. We studied the lipid profiles of 62 adults (29 males) with stable renal function (mean plasma creatinine 0.14 mmol/l, SD 0.07), 7 months to 21 years after renal transplantation. Fifteen patients (24%) were above the age- and sex-adjusted 95th percentile for total triglyceride and 10 (16%) for total cholesterol concentrations when compared with a local reference population. The most common lipoprotein abnormalities were type IIa (19%) and type IIb (13%). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the use of diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were significant factors determining plasma triglyceride concentrations. There were significant bivariate associations between plasma triglyceride concentration and duration since transplantation, plasma creatinine concentration and the use of ciclosporin and diuretics. Duration since transplantation and ciclosporin use were significant factors determining lower plasma cholesterol concentrations. The use of ciclosporin and diuretics was associated with a significantly higher apolipoprotein (apo) B concentration. The cholesterol/HDL cholesterol risk ratio correlated poorly with the apo B/apo A-1 ratio. The value of these ratios as predictors of coronary artery disease need to be established in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "15": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of angiotensin II (AII) in GnRH-induced PRL release on the paracrine interaction among anterior pituitary cells of young male rats. A 20-min perifusion with 100 nM GnRH increased PRL release (p less than 0.01) from pituitary cell aggregates, and GnRH-stimulated release of PRL was significantly suppressed by saralasin, a specific AII antagonist. The release of AI from pituitary cell aggregates was significantly (p less than 0.01) increased by GnRH. These data demonstrate that GnRH is capable of stimulating PRL release through a mechanism that may involve the release of angiotensin. It was also speculated that some factors released from pituitary cells, such as angiotensin, might be involved in the control of ovarian functions. As an approach to investigate this possibility, porcine anterior pituitary cells and ovarian granulosa cells were co-cultured on type 1 collagen membrane which permits the exchange of the substance with molecular weights less than 9,000. The growth and progesterone production of the granulosa cells co-cultured with pituitary cells were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than those of the cells cultured in monolayer fashion. Thus, the results of the present study revealed the biological significances of the paracrine system involving angiotensin between gonadotroph and lactotroph in pituitary cells and the direct effect of the factors derived from pituitary cells on ovarian functions.", 
    "16": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to inhibit intimal thickening following balloon catheterization of rat carotid arteries. To assess the role of the renin-angiotensin pathway and the angiotensin type-I (AT1) receptor in this effect, the nonpeptide Ang II antagonist losartan (DuP 753) or vehicle was infused continuously i.v. in rats from two days before to two weeks after balloon injury to the left common carotid artery; drug effects upon intimal thickening were examined histologically. Losartan produced a dose-dependent reduction in cross-sectional area of intimal lesions determined two weeks post balloon injury. At 5 mg/kg/day a nonsignificant 23% reduction of intimal area was observed. At the higher dose of 15 mg/kg/day, losartan produced a 48% reduction in intimal area (P less than 0.05) compared to the vehicle-infused group. The cellular density of the neointima was not affected by losartan, indicating a probable effect of the drug upon migration and/or proliferation of smooth muscle cells. In separate groups of non-ballooned rats, losartan infusions of 5 and 15 mg/kg/day produced significant rightward shifts (averaging 6.4- and 55-fold, respectively) in curves relating increases in blood pressure to intravenous Ang II in pithed rats determined between 2 and 16 days following initiation of losartan infusion. Mean arterial blood pressure (determined under alpha-chloralose anesthesia) was reduced following continuous losartan infusion for 6 days from 128 +/- 8 mm Hg (vehicle) to 105 +/- 8 mm Hg at 5 mg/kg/day (P less than 0.05), and 106 +/- 4 mm Hg at 15 mg/kg/day (P less than 0.05). Thus, losartan attenuated the vascular response to balloon catheter injury, and this effect was associated with functional block of vascular AT1 receptors. The results support a role for Ang II, acting via AT1 receptors, in myointimal thickening subsequent to balloon injury of rat carotid arteries.", 
    "17": "Transient myocardial ischemia may result from obstruction to flow in the large epicardial coronary arteries or diminished flow reserve due to small vessel disease or left ventricular hypertrophy. In patients with coronary heart disease, calcium blockers have proven to reduce stress induced ischemia in patients with normal left ventricular function and in those with ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, recent studies indicate a need for caution when giving calcium antagonists to patients with postinfarction left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moreover, calcium antagonists that reduce heart rate (diltiazem) are able as a monotherapy to reduce total ischemic burden. Calcium antagonists that may increase rate (dihydropiridines) have to be combined with beta-blockers to achieve this goal. For 24-h control of ischemia the ischemic threshold should be determined for a differentiated therapy in the individual patient. Is the ischemic threshold of the majority of episodes lower than the exercise threshold, a calcium blocker should work. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not effective in stress-induced ischemia, but may reduce total ischemic burden, although this effect is not significant. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and/or small vessel disease, calcium blockers and ACE inhibitors are probably effective in regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and vascular hypertrophy. However, it remains to be shown that ischemia is reduced by these drugs.", 
    "18": "Calcium antagonists and converting enzyme inhibitors are now widely used as first line therapy for high blood pressure. This gradual move from the diuretics and beta-blockers is, in part, due to fewer or different side effects and the perceived lack of deleterious metabolic effects. Calcium antagonists may be more effective in elderly and low-renin patients. However, this is likely to be due in part to the finding that calcium antagonists are more effective with a higher initial pressure. The efficacy of converting enzyme inhibitors is related to the initial level of plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) or plasma renin activity. However, patients with low plasma renin activity also have a fall in blood pressure with converting enzyme inhibitors, illustrating the importance of differences in Ang II receptor sensitivity to the prevailing level of Ang II. Many patients require the combination of more than one drug to control their blood pressure. Combining a converting enzyme inhibitor with either a dihydropyridine or a benzothiazepine calcium antagonist is a particularly effective approach to the treatment of patients with more severe essential hypertension.", 
    "19": "In 15 randomized, double-blind studies with blood pressure measured at the end of the dosing interval, diltiazem sustained-release or conventional tablets were found to be equal in efficacy to hydrochlorothiazide, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and other calcium-channel antagonists. The total number of patients with adverse effects and those who drop out due to adverse effects are similar for diltiazem and the other drugs. Combination therapy with diltiazem and captopril showed additive effects, and combination of diltiazem with hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol showed additional, but perhaps less than additive, effects. Six studies in older and younger patients have shown no overall effect of age on the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem. Two studies showed no difference in mean antihypertensive response between black and non-black patients. In contrast to diuretics and beta-blockers, diltiazem does not have adverse metabolic effects on electrolytes, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Diltiazem is an excellent antianginal agent. It has been shown in one study to decrease proteinuria as effectively as lisinopril, and it may have renal protective effects. The antihypertensive efficacy of diltiazem as monotherapy is equal to that of all other antihypertensive classes, and it is tolerated as well or better than most other antihypertensive drugs. Diltiazem is particularly indicated in patients with hypertension and concurrent angina pectoris, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, and, perhaps, chronic renal disease.", 
    "20": "In normotensive nonpregnant women (n = 23), the plasma concentrations of immunoreactive endothelin-1 (ir-ET-1) were not different from nonpregnant women with essential hypertension (n = 15): 3.6 (2.0-5.4) ng/L (mean, range) versus 3.8 (2.4-5.8) ng/L. In normotensive pregnant women (n = 25), the plasma level of ir-ET-1 was 2.1 (1.3-3.4) ng/L (p less than 0.01) lower than in normotensive nonpregnant women. Pre-eclamptic patients (n = 25) had elevated ir-ET-1 plasma levels of 5.0 (2.1-12.4) ng/L (p less than 0.001 for normotensive pregnant women, p less than 0.01 for nonpregnant women). The low level of ir-ET-1 in normotensive pregnant women may be explained by the increase in the distribution volume of ir-ET-1 during the course of pregnancy. Damage of vascular endothelium is a consistent morphological abnormality in pre-eclampsia. Elevated ir-ET-1 in plasma might be a biochemical marker of this abnormality and may contribute to the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.", 
    "21": "It has been shown that in vitro angiotensin II (Ang II) potently downregulates endothelin-1 (ET-1) binding sites. In this study, we investigated in vivo the interactions between the renin-angiotensin system and ET-1. Sprague-Dawley rats were pithed, ventilated, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was recorded. ET-1 (1 nmol/kg) induced a biphasic response: a transient hypotension followed by a sustained increase of DBP. Captopril (5 mg/kg, i.v.) or Sar1-Ile8-Ang II (10 ng/kg/min) did not affect ET-1 responses. In other experiments, DBP was increased by infusion of methoxamine (MTX: 10, 20, 25, 32.5 micrograms/kg/min) or Ang II (50, 100, 150, 200 ng/kg/min). ET-1-induced hypotension correlated with the level of DBP (r = 0.94) for both agonists. The elevation of DBP in response to ET-1 was also related to the vascular tone but was dose-dependently attenuated by Ang II infusion when compared with MTX. Conversely, infusion of ET-1 (0.1 nmol/kg/min) blunted the pressor response to Ang II (0.1 micrograms/kg) but not to MTX (50 micrograms/kg). These doses induced the same increase of DBP in pithed control rats. Similarly, increased plasma renin activity induced by chronic salt depletion (0% NaCl) in pithed rats provoked a shift to the right of the dose-response curves to Ang II and ET-1 but not to MTX. These results suggest an in vivo cross-desensitization between ET-1 and Ang II.", 
    "22": "The aim of this article is to review the pharmacokinetics of perindopril and its active metabolite perindoprilat in high-risk populations in comparison with their basic features in healthy volunteers. As it has been shown that the kinetics of perindoprilat are mainly affected by renal insufficiency, a dosage reduction is therefore recommended on initiation of treatment in elderly patients and in those with renal failure according to the degree of renal failure. In patients with chronic heart failure, the kinetics of both perindopril and perindoprilat were shown to have been altered, also indicating the need for an initial dosage reduction in such patients. Hepatic impairment had no significant effect on the kinetics of either the prodrug or the active metabolite.", 
    "23": "Perindopril (4 mg) was compared to atenolol (50 mg), captopril (25 mg b.i.d.), or a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg and amiloride 5 mg) in three studies involving a total of 503 hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-125 mm Hg. A 4-week single-blind placebo period preceded 12 weeks of active treatment. Dose titration was at weeks 4 and 8 if the supine DBP was greater than 90 mm Hg. The dose was doubled and, if necessary, a diuretic was added in atenolol or captopril comparison and atenolol added in the diuretic study. The fall in supine blood pressure (BP) was 27/17 mm Hg with perindopril and 21/16 mm Hg for atenolol. Fifty-five percent on perindopril and 48% on atenolol were controlled on monotherapy, increasing to 78 and 58% with addition of hydrochlorothiazide. Captopril caused a BP fall of 19/12 mm Hg compared to 27/18 mm Hg for perindopril with 49% of both groups being controlled on monotherapy. Diuretic addition produced a greater antihypertensive effect with perindopril 75% compared to 57% of the captopril patients achieving control. Perindopril caused a comparable fall in supine BP to the diuretic combination 27/19 mm Hg and 31/18 mm Hg but the fall in erect systolic BP was significantly greater for the diuretic. At 3 months, 84% of the diuretic and 78% of the perindopril group achieved the target BP. There were no adverse effects on the blood count or blood chemistry with a low incidence of side effects and withdrawals from treatment. These studies show that perindopril compares favorably with the standard antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "24": "Thirty-six hypertensive patients with impaired renal function entered a long-term study to assess the safety of perindopril. There were 28 men and 8 women of mean age 57.1 +/- 2.0 years (mean +/- SEM). The duration of documented hypertension was 7.3 +/- 1.2 years. Perindopril was given orally in single daily doses. The initial dosage was chosen according to the degree of renal function impairment: 29 patients received 4 mg o.d. [creatinine clearance (Clcr), 42.2 +/- 3.2 ml.min-1] and 7 patients received 2 mg o.d. (Clcr, 22.3 +/- 3.1 ml.min-1). Patients in whom blood pressure was not controlled had their dose doubled and then, if necessary, an additional diuretic therapy was added at subsequent visits. Six patients were withdrawn for adverse events (myocardial infarction, pneumonia, leucopenia in a patient who had lupus, diabetes mellitus, skin rash, epigastric pain), two patients were withdrawn for poor compliance, and three for personal convenience. The mean duration of treatment was 10.2 months with a range of 3-12 months (excluding one patient who died from myocardial infarction in the first days of the study and was not included in the analysis). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly (from 170.5/100.6 +/- 3.4/1.8 mm Hg to 151.8/88.8 +/- 3.0/1.7 mm Hg, n = 35, p less than 0.001). Baseline and final values of plasma creatinine (from 223.7 +/- 22.7 to 234.7 +/- 28.5 mumols/l), Clcr (42.5 +/- 3.2 to 45.7 +/- 4.6 ml.min-1), and kalemia (from 4.4 +/- 0.1 to 4.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) were not statistically different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a widely distributed dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidase. Using computer analysis of the binding of radiolabeled ACE inhibitors, we have mapped the distribution of ACE in normal animals and in models of disease, and have studied the tissue effects of ACE inhibitors. In the myocardium, ACE is located in vascular and valvular structures as well as in the atria and ventricles. Its concentration is increased in myocardial hypertrophy in the infarct model of heart failure. Chronic ACE-inhibitor therapy prevents myocardial hypertrophy. In the brain, ACE is localized in multiple specific sites where its role is unknown. Following oral ACE-inhibitor treatment, effects are restricted predominantly to areas devoid of blood-brain barrier. Early studies suggest ACE inhibitors enhance cognition. In the testis, ACE is located in the seminiferous tubules where its function is unknown. It is not inhibited following oral ACE-inhibitor treatment. In the kidney and gastrointestinal tract, ACE is in high concentration in the epithelial brush border where its function is unknown. In clinical use ACE inhibitors primarily affect the cardiovascular system. With pharmacological developments, ACE inhibitors targeted for specific organs may have effects predominantly in the brain, heart, reproductive system, or gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "26": "The load of the heart in hypertension is related both to increased peripheral vascular resistance and decreased aortic compliance. From noninvasive studies involving determinations of pulse-wave velocity and systolic-diastolic variations of aortic arch diameter, it can be shown that increased aortic elastic modulus is strongly related to increased cardiac mass. The relationship is observed even after adjustment for the level of mean arterial pressure. It is suggested that decreased aortic compliance in hypertension causes a disproportionate increase in systolic pressure and end-systolic stress, thus contributing to promote cardiac hypertrophy. Such a possibility may have consequences for long-term antihypertensive therapy. Following converting enzyme inhibition and calcium blockade, important dissociations may be observed between the antihypertensive effect and the cardiac and arterial changes.", 
    "27": "To evaluate whether perindopril, a carboxyl-containing new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, exerts its antihypertensive action through the stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis, 10 uncomplicated essential hypertensive patients randomly received indomethacin (50 mg b.i.d.) or the corresponding placebo for 1 week and the reverse treatment after 2 weeks. Perindopril alone tended to reduce serum and urinary thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and to raise urinary 6-ketoPGF1 alpha and PGE2 and inhibited serum ACE activity 24 h post dosing by about 85%. Indomethacin, which significantly inhibited serum TxB2 and urinary TxB2, 6-ketoPGF1 alpha, and PGE2 without interfering with the inhibitory effect of perindopril on ACE, significantly reduced the antihypertensive action of perindopril alone by about 30%, but decreased though not significantly that of perindopril plus placebo. Although the size of the study limits the interpretation, these findings suggest that the stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis plays only a minor role in the antihypertensive action of perindopril.", 
    "28": "Vascular remodeling is central to the pathophysiology of hypertension and atherosclerosis. The effects of antihypertensive drugs on this process are important to consider from a mechanistic and a pathogenetic point of view in relation to vascular complications of hypertension, e.g., decrease in vascular reserves, shift in cerebral blood flow autoregulation and atherosclerosis development. There is now evidence that, in addition to several other growth factors, vasoactive peptides such as angiotensin II may act as vascular smooth muscle growth promoting substances. Based on these data, the effects of perindopril, a potent and long-lasting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on structural and mechanical properties of the arterial wall, have been studied in animal models of hypertension as well as in humans. Perindopril completely reversed aortic medial hypertrophy and arterial stiffening observed in renovascular hypertensive rats. Similar benefits were reported in mesenteric resistance vessels of spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effect of perindopril was totally in keeping with potent inhibition of vascular ACE and emphasized the potential role of angiotensin II as a vascular growth modulator. Clinical studies confirmed animal experiments; both suggest that increases in arterial compliance and distensibility following perindopril is likely to be related to drug-induced modification of the arterial wall, at least partially independently of blood pressure reduction. The increase in arterial compliance was associated with a selective decrease in pulse pressure, a finding that is important, not only for the arterial wall, but also for the structure and function of the hypertensive heart.", 
    "29": "The pathogenesis of hypertension is associated with a remodeling of vascular structure. Folkow has postulated that the decreased luminal area and thickened medial layer in hypertensive vessels enhance the vasoconstrictive response to vasoactive agents. It is hypothesized that this increase in vascular reactivity may serve to perpetuate hypertension. These same structural changes also predispose to the end-organ damage associated with hypertension. A growing body of evidence suggests that autocrine-paracrine vasoactive substances and growth factors modulate vascular structure in hypertension. It is speculated that therapeutic interventions that normalize blood pressure as well as reverse the vascular remodeling process may have special clinical value. The roles of the paracrine renin-angiotensin system and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension are discussed in this context.", 
    "30": "This article examines the evidence justifying the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-line antihypertensive drugs. ACE inhibitors are as effective as traditional antihypertensive agents and, in addition, exert their blood-pressure-lowering effect with near optimal hemodynamic alterations. These drugs have a good tolerance and safety profile although they induce cough in an appreciable number of patients. They can be safely associated with other antihypertensive agents to provide therapeutic benefit in a large proportion of the hypertensive population. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated only in bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of a single kidney. Although to date no prospective study has examined the ability of ACE inhibitors to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension, several features of these drugs suggest that this may be the case as several effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension are potentially nephroprotective and cardioprotective.", 
    "31": "The prognosis for clinical congestive heart failure remains poor even with modern treatment as severe ventricular dysfunction is often present at the time of clinical presentation. A substantial improvement in prognosis might be achieved through earlier intervention and a preventive approach to treatment following myocardial infarction to delay progressive ventricular dilation and the occurrence of clinical heart failure. The rationale for treatment of left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction is further supported by the prognostic importance of ventricular dilation and by experimental animal studies that demonstrate that converting enzyme inhibition can improve ventricular function and survival following myocardial infarction. Similarly, clinical studies have demonstrated that converting enzyme inhibition can improve ventricular function during the year following transmural myocardial infarction. Possible mechanisms of action that require further understanding include ventricular afterload reduction and direct coronary and tissue effects of angiotensin II blockade. The further benefit to be obtained from very early intervention following myocardial infarction is currently being addressed in several studies. Large-scale studies also in progress should determine the mortality benefit of such treatment. Further questions that remain include the optimal timing of intervention, comparison with other treatments such as nitrates and beta-blockade, and also the use of appropriate combination treatments.", 
    "32": "Death during and following myocardial infarction can arise from a number of different causes. Some of them, such as early ventricular fibrillation and cardiac rupture, seem unrelated to infarct size. However, deaths occurring later during the course of infarction do seem to be related to the extent of myocardial damage and to such phenomena as infarct extension and expansion, and the mechanisms involved include cardiac failure and shock, and late arrhythmias. Preventive measures must be directed at the various mechanisms involved. Thrombolytic drugs, by limiting infarct size, prevent death from several causes, whereas beta-blockers seem mainly to operate by preventing early rupture, reinfarction, and late ventricular fibrillation. Aspirin prevents reinfarction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may prove to have a beneficial role in the early phase by unloading the heart and later by preventing infarct expansion and subsequent cardiac failure.", 
    "33": "Progressive deterioration of the failing heart is now recognized to be a major cause of disability and death in patients with congestive heart failure. It appears that although the normal human heart functions for at least 90-100 years, overload-induced hypertrophy shortens the heart's life span to about 5 years. This accelerated deterioration of the failing heart can be viewed as a cardiomyopathy of overload in which chronic overloading causes changes in the myocardial cells that, while increasing cell mass, reduce their long-term viability. Although the pathogenesis of this putative cardiomyopathy remains poorly understood, chronic energy starvation and altered myocardial cell growth and composition appear to be contributing factors. Preferential expression of fetal isoforms of key muscle proteins, which accompanies accelerated growth of the overloaded heart, may contribute to this cardiomyopathy. The hypothesis that the cardiomyopathy of overload is due in part to a growth abnormality is supported by evidence that deterioration of the failing heart is slowed by the converting enzyme inhibitors, which may attenuate important effects of angiotensin II to stimulate cellular growth.", 
    "34": "Previous trials have shown that a 5-6 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure produced by antihypertensive treatment (mainly diuretics) reduces the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) by 14% SD5 (2p less than 0.01). However, the 95% confidence limits for this estimate of treatment effect are wide and consistent, with true reductions as small as 4% or as large as 22%. For this reason, it is not possible to determine whether the treatment benefit is of a worthwhile magnitude. Because CAD remains the leading cause of death in hypertensive patients (and normotensive patients) in most Western populations, further studies are required to determine more precisely the effect of blood pressure reduction on the incidence of CAD. This could be achieved by further large-scale studies comparing antihypertensive treatment with no treatment. It could also be achieved by comparing the effects of more and less intensive antihypertensive treatment regimens. Additional relevant information might also be generated by studies comparing the effects on CAD of new classes of antihypertensive drugs (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists) with those of older classes (in particular diuretics). In all such studies, the detection of plausible treatment effects or of plausible treatment differences requires the recruitment of large study populations with follow-up continued for several years. This is only feasible if study methods are kept simple to insure the widest possible collaboration.", 
    "35": "Microvascular damage occurs in both diabetes and hypertension and hypertension is a risk factor for diabetic microangiopathy. In both conditions, indirect evidence suggests that capillary pressure might be raised. A servonulling pressure measuring technique has been used in conjunction with direct micropuncture of finger nailfold capillaries to determine capillary pressure dynamically. In patients with essential hypertension, capillary pressure is raised compared to matched normotensive controls. In insulin-dependent diabetic patients, capillary pressure is also raised, to a degree that correlates with recent diabetic control. In a pilot study of hypertensive diabetic patients, elevated capillary pressure has been normalized using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Manipulation of microvascular hemodynamics in diabetes and hypertension may provide a means of protecting against the microvascular complications of these two conditions.", 
    "36": "In an attempt to separate the cardiac effects of converting-enzyme (CE) inhibition from those on blood pressure, experiments were performed in rats and dogs with nonantihypertensive (subhypotensive) doses of the CE inhibitor ramipril. (a) Left ventricular hypertrophy: Rats with aortic constriction treated with a nonantihypertensive dose of ramipril (10 micrograms/kg/day) for 6 weeks showed the same prevention and regression of cardiac hypertrophy as groups receiving the antihypertensive dose of 1 mg/kg/day. Comparable results were obtained in animals treated for 1 year. (b) Ischemia-reperfusion injuries: In rats, subchronic oral administration of ramipril in a subhypotensive dose (10 micrograms/kg/day) prevented ex vivo postischemic reperfusion arrhythmias and improved cardiodynamic and metabolic parameters. Almost complete inhibition of cardiac CE was achieved with this low dose. (c) Acute myocardial infarction: Ramiprilat (40 ng/kg/min) was infused for 6 h into the left coronary artery of anesthetized dogs with a ligation of the descending branch of this artery. This route and the low dose were chosen to achieve local cardiac effects without affecting systemic hemodynamics. Ramiprilat significantly reduced the infarct area expressed as a percentage of the area at risk. This cardioprotective effect of ramiprilat was mimicked by bradykinin and abolished by coadministration of a bradykinin antagonist. Thus, factors beyond blood pressure reduction and load changes may add to the cardiovascular benefits of CE inhibitors. This may indicate local (cardiac) paracrine and/or autocrine effects of the renin-angiotensin system and/or participation of kinins.", 
    "37": "The discovery of the components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in various tissues gave rise to the idea that functional \"tissue\" RASs exist that are more or less independent of the hormonal RAS. Further support for this notion came from the recent demonstration of the mRNA for the protein components of the RAS in a number of organs. Last but not least, the introduction of the converting-enzyme (CE) inhibitors, generating an enormous scientific interest in the role of the RAS, has contributed to the concept of \"tissue\" RASs, since some of the effects of these drugs were thought to be reconciled better with \"tissue\" than with plasma RAS inhibition. However, this model of plasma vs. \"tissue\" RAS still suffers from a number of conceptual problems. For instance, with respect to the \"tissue\" RAS in the vascular wall, it is not clear at present whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is at all active inside endothelial cells. In addition, all evidence available speaks against its localization in the vascular media, while there may be some activity of the enzyme in the adventitial layer. Concerning the heart, there is at present no unequivocal evidence for a local angiotensin II (Ang II) production through ACE in cardiac tissue outside the coronary vessels. The localization of Ang II generation within tissue RASs in the adrenal gland or in the kidney, where Ang II may be generated through CE at the tubular brush border, are far from being elucidated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The efficacy and safety of ramipril were compared with that of digoxin in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study of 35 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), New York Heart Association (NYHA) grades II to IV, stabilized on diuretic maintenance therapy. Major assessments were conducted at baseline and at the end of each 10-week treatment period: primary efficacy variables were total exercise duration (modified Bruce, treadmill), NYHA grade, and clinical signs and symptoms (by visual analogue score) of heart failure. Twenty-seven patients completed the study. There were two deaths (one on each study drug) and six patient withdrawals (one on ramipril and five on digoxin). Although the NYHA grade was significantly better on ramipril than on digoxin, there were no other important differences in the relief of either signs or symptoms of heart failure. A significant order effect was observed with the exercise testing data and therefore only data in the first active treatment period were analyzed; no significant differences were noted. There were fewer reports of adverse effects, and no clinically significant episodes of hyperkalemia or renal impairment on ramipril. We conclude that ramipril seems to be better tolerated and marginally more effective than digoxin in the management of patients with moderate to severe chronic CHF, stabilized on maintenance diuretic therapy.", 
    "39": "Ramipril was administered to 13 patients, aged 49-80 years, weighing 53.5-90.3 kg, with congestive heart failure (CHF) for 2 weeks in an open trial. One patient dropped out after day 1 and another accidentally received another angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, so that 11 patients remained for analysis. Each patient received 5 mg of ramipril daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout period. Urine was collected in 4-h fractions for 12 h followed by a 12-h fraction on days 1, 8, and 15. Creatinine clearance, as well as the excretion of albumin and the urinary brush border enzymes gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminopeptidase (AAP), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined. The values for albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, GGT, AAP, NAG, and LDH obtained for the various days during the time course before and during multiple dosing were subjected to an analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test for means. Daily albumin excretion decreased during treatment with ramipril from 23.8 +/- 27.4 mg/24 h (baseline) to 12.9 +/- 15.1 (day 1), 10.8 +/- 15.6 (day 8), and 12.4 +/- 12.7 mg/24 h (day 15). The differences were significant (alpha = 0.05) when compared to pretreatment albumin excretion. Creatinine clearance increased from 78.8 +/- 38.3 ml/min (baseline) to 82.4 +/- 34.6 (day 1), 85.1 +/- 28.5 (day 8), and 91.7 +/- 36.4 ml/min (day 15). The change on day 15 was significant (alpha = 0.05) when compared to pretreatment values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "Hypertensive patients from a double-blind study comparing 5 mg of ramipril, 10 mg of ramipril, and 5 mg of ramipril + 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were enrolled in an open 1-year extension study with ramipril and concomitant HCTZ. The starting dose of ramipril was 5 mg/day. Patients were given 25 mg of HCTZ in addition only if their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was higher than 90 mm Hg. During treatment, the investigator was permitted to adjust the dosage of ramipril and HCTZ according to BP response and tolerance. A total of 159 patients were included in the 1-year study (86 men, 73 women, mean age of 54 years). One hundred twenty-one of the 159 patients received the combination of ramipril + HCTZ at some point in the study, 83 of them for more than 50 weeks. Thirty-eight patients were treated with ramipril alone over the entire study. In patients treated with ramipril monotherapy throughout the study, the largest drop in blood pressure occurred before visit 1. In patients treated with ramipril + HCTZ for greater than or equal to 50 weeks, the mean blood pressure continued to fall up to around week 10, while the therapy was being adjusted. Subsequently, the mean blood pressures remained low and fairly stable in both treatment groups. Similar results were seen in patients treated with the combination for less than 50 weeks. Adverse events were reported in 11 of the 38 patients in the ramipril group, in 22 of 83 patients treated with the combination for more than 50 weeks, and in 9 of 38 patients treated with the combination for 50 weeks or less. The analysis of the laboratory values revealed no general deterioration. It can be concluded that ramipril alone and in combination with HCTZ is an effective and safe drug for the long-term treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "41": "The mechanism of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in diabetic patients remains controversial. Sixteen type 1, insulin-dependent diabetics with incipient nephropathy received ramipril, a long-acting ACE inhibitor, at hypotensive doses (treatment A: 5 mg/day, n = 8) or at nonhypotensive doses (treatment B: 1.25 mg/day, n = 8) during a 6-week, double-blind, parallel study to establish whether its antihypertensive effects could be dissociated from its local renal effects. Blood pressure, UAE, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF, constant [125I]iodothalamate + [131I]hippurate infusion), and ACE activity were measured before and after treatment. Blood pressure was lowered with treatment A but not with treatment B. UAE and ACE activity were reduced with both treatments. Baseline GFR and ERPF were not altered by either treatment. In the patient population as a whole, ACE inhibition correlated with a rise in ERPF and with a reduction in filtration fraction (GFR/ERPF), but not with the changes in blood pressure. Changes in UAE correlated with the changes in filtration fraction. It is concluded that renal hemodynamics may be modified by ramipril independently of blood pressure changes.", 
    "42": "Six double-blind studies were designed to assess the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Of 1,189 hypertensive patients in these studies, 105 patients were diabetic. They were randomly assigned either to a ramipril monotherapy group (1.25-10 mg/day) or to one of the following treatment groups: ramipril (5 mg/day) plus piretanide (3 mg/day), captopril (100 mg/day), enalapril (10-20 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day), or atenolol (100 mg/day). In all studies, a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in phase was followed by a 6-week double-blind active treatment phase. Significant reductions in blood pressure were achieved with all antihypertensive agents. No statistically significant deleterious effects were observed on concentrations of blood glucose, although diabetics who received hydrochlorothiazide showed slight increases in blood glucose levels. Ramipril was well tolerated by diabetic patients, and no serious adverse events occurred. Adverse events reported were typical of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "43": "To evaluate a possible influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) and an euglycemic clamp were performed in 10 nonobese, nondiabetic patients with mild hypertension before and after treatment with ramipril for 14 days. Following ramipril treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower (152.5 +/- 10.6/97.5 +/- 4.3 vs. 136.5 +/- 18.9/79.5 +/- 16.4 mm Hg). Therapy with ramipril showed no influence on glucose tolerance (serum glucose of 106.8 +/- 32.8 vs. 109.1 +/- 33.9 mg/dl at 120 min during the oGTT), insulin secretion (53.0 +/- 45.7 vs. 41.1 +/- 10.6 microU/ml at 120 min), and insulin sensitivity (glucose infusion rate of 180.8 +/- 60.7 vs. 199.8 +/- 77.5 mg/m2/min after 3 h of clamp). In conclusion, short-term treatment of hypertension with ramipril has no influence on glucose metabolism in nondiabetic patients.", 
    "44": "The acute and chronic arterial effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril were studied in hypertensive patients. Hemodynamic and biological parameters were measured 3 h after the first dose of 5 mg of ramipril, and then again after 4 weeks of treatment, 3 and 24 h after drug administration. Brachial and carotid artery hemodynamics were evaluated using a two-dimensional pulsed Doppler system. Arterial distensibility was studied noninvasively in three arterial segments (carotidofemoral, brachioradial, and femorotibial) by evaluating the pulse wave velocity. Ramipril lowered the blood pressure significantly after acute and chronic administration. Chronic treatment with ramipril was followed by a long-lasting increase in brachial artery diameter, a decrease in forearm vascular resistance, and an improvement in aortic distensibility. The other arterial segments studied did not show any significant changes. Our results suggest that the long-lasting arterial effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril are partly pressure independent and are related to effects on arterial tone that may reduce the cardiovascular abnormalities associated with hypertension.", 
    "45": "This trial was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, variable-dose study comparing ramipril with atenolol, and incorporating a 4-week run-in period on placebo. A total of 92 patients suffering from mild to moderate hypertension were randomized to the trial. Following a 4-week run-in period on placebo, newly diagnosed patients were only continued if their blood pressure remained within the defined range throughout the placebo run-in period. Known hypertensive patients who were safely switched to the trial therapy were only continued if their blood pressure was within the defined range at the end of this placebo washout period. An analysis of the data at baseline showed no statistical differences between treatment groups. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced from baseline in each group, but there were no differences between treatments. The study showed that ramipril and atenolol were both successful at reducing and controlling mild-to-moderate hypertension, but it showed no difference between treatments.", 
    "46": "The antihypertensive effect of ramipril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was evaluated and compared to enalapril in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects received either 2.5, 5, or 10 mg of ramipril given once daily or 5, 10, or 20 mg of enalapril once daily for 4 weeks. Significant decreases from baseline in supine and standing diastolic blood pressures were seen in all dosage groups at end point. There were significant decreases at end point for supine and standing systolic blood pressures at the higher doses. Side effects were minimal and were similar for all treatment groups.", 
    "47": "Appropriate clinical trial methodologies in general practice and suitable end points for dose-finding studies are discussed with reference to antihypertensive drugs in general and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in particular. Two clinical studies were conducted with ramipril, a new nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, to identify the minimum effective dose for the management of mild-to-moderate hypertension. Study 1 was a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized design with three treatment groups (placebo and 2.5 and 5 mg of ramipril), and study 2 was an open, single-blind design with individual dose titration from 2.5 to 5 mg of ramipril if the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was greater than 90 mm Hg after 3 weeks. Response rates and DBP reductions with 2.5 mg of ramipril were similar in both studies, although overall response rates, DBP reductions, and side effect incidence appeared to be greater in the open, single-blind, dose-titration study. It is concluded that study methodology apparently influences efficacy and tolerability.", 
    "48": "In this study, the tolerability and safety of ramipril, as monotherapy and in combination with a low dose of furosemide, were assessed in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in general practice. After a placebo run-in phase, patients received ramipril as monotherapy in a dose of 2.5 to 5 mg daily for 6 weeks. Nonresponders (diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg) entered a double-blind treatment period, and received either 10 mg of ramipril daily, or 5 mg of ramipril in combination with 20 mg of furosemide daily. The tolerability of the study medication was assessed by reported adverse events, and by monitoring blood cell count, electrolytes, serum creatinine, fasting blood glucose, and apolipoproteins AI and B. Of a total of 770 patients who entered the placebo run-in phase, 661 patients were enrolled in the first active treatment period. The most commonly reported adverse events were headache, cough, dizziness, asthenia, cramps, diarrhea, and nausea, but not all of these events were related to ramipril treatment. A total of 38 patients discontinued active treatment due to nonserious adverse events, mainly cough, dizziness, or diarrhea. There appeared to be a relationship between the prevalence of cough and ramipril dosage; however, an increased incidence of cough was also observed during outbreaks of influenza in France.

Of these patients, 129 also received 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily at some point during the trial. To evaluate whether tolerance to ramipril developed during long-term treatment, a subgroup of 202 patients was analyzed for efficacy maintenance. Prior to enrolling in the 2-year study, these patients had received ramipril monotherapy in a short-term, double-blind study and had been classified as responders, i.e., their diastolic blood pressure had been maintained at less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. At the end of 104 weeks of treatment, 45.9% of patients were on 2.5 mg of ramipril alone and 43.6% were on 5 mg of ramipril alone. Only four patients required the addition of 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. No clinically important changes occurred, and kidney function was well maintained. The most frequently reported adverse events excluding intercurrent illnesses were dizziness/vertigo (6%), asthenia (4%), nausea (3%), headache (2%), and abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disorder, rash, and increased cough (1% each).

A total of 412 young patients (17-65 years of age) and 90 old patients (66-87 years) in these studies received single daily doses of 5 or 10 mg of ramipril. At the end point of treatment, mean reductions in supine systolic blood pressure (19.4 mm Hg in young patients, 17.8 mm Hg in old) were significantly different, whereas mean reductions in supine diastolic blood pressure (13.3 mm Hg in young patients, 12.5 mm Hg in old) showed no significant difference. The number of responders was similar in both age groups: 68.6% and 71.1% of young and old patients respectively.

One hundred subjects with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were randomized to ramipril, 10 mg or placebo once daily for a 4-week treatment period. Ramipril decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures throughout the 24-h period after dosing. Blood pressures measured manually 24 h postdose also showed that ramipril significantly reduced supine and standing blood pressures when compared with placebo.

Pharmacokinetic data were collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and 1 year. Mean peak concentrations of ramiprilat (the active diacid) were 11.5 ng/ml acutely, 18.5 ng/ml at 1 month, and 31.3 ng/ml at 1 year, and these were all statistically significantly different. Mean half-lives of ramiprilat were 5.5 h acutely, 5.2 h at 1 month, and 4.6 h at 1 year, and these were not statistically significantly different. Mean areas under the curve excluding the component for saturable binding were 106.8 ng/h/ml acutely, 115.7 ng/h/ml at 1 month, and 248 ng/h/ml at 1 year; the latter was statistically significantly different from the earlier readings.

A total of 41 patients were studied (32 males and 9 females, aged 48-71 years). Twenty-two of these patients received up to 5 days treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramipril (5 mg p.o.) prior to surgery, the remaining 19 patients served as controls (no ramipril treatment). Under surgery vascular tissues were removed and renin-like activities measured in carotid and renal arteries. Plasma renin and ACE activity were determined before and after surgical intervention. Vascular renin values were two- to threefold higher in ACE-treated hypertensive patients compared to normotensive and untreated hypertensive controls (irrespective of concomitant atherosclerotic lesions). There were no differences in vascular renin observed between primary (essential) and secondary hypertension. In the hypertensive patients treated with ramipril, blood pressures were markedly (but not significantly) lowered in 12 patients. A similar pattern was observed for treatment-induced changes in plasma renin (increased) and ACE activity (decreased). The findings of this study demonstrate that treatment with an ACE inhibitor, such as ramipril, evokes changes in extrarenal tissues similar to those demonstrable in plasma. Conceivably, the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibition on human tissue is partially induced at the vascular level.", 
    "55": "Four cholecystectomy patients, aged between 52 and 56 years, weighing between 64 and 90 kg, received 5 mg of ramipril as a single dose in order to investigate the pharmacokinetics and excretion pattern of ramipril. All patients had a T-drainage that allowed bile collection. Serum was collected at regular intervals, bile was collected hourly for 6 h followed by a 6- and 12-h fraction, and urine was collected every 2 h for 8 h followed by a 4- and 12-h fraction. The concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilat in serum and ramipril, ramiprilat, ramipril glucuronide, ramiprilat glucuronide, diketopiperazine, and diketopiperazine acid in bile and urine were determined and the amounts excreted in urine and bile over 24 h were calculated. There were great interindividual differences in maximum concentrations as well as in the time to reach maximum concentrations in plasma and bile as well as in the excretion pattern between urine and bile. The highest concentrations in bile were found for diketopiperazine acid (3,080 ng/ml) and ramipril glucuronide (2,414 ng/ml). In general, only minimal amounts of unchanged ramipril (prodrug) were detected in the bile. In the urine, the major metabolites excreted were diketopiperazine acid, ramiprilat, and diketopiperazine in amounts of 537, 188, and 124 micrograms, respectively. In bile, the main substances excreted were diketopiperazine acid and ramiprilat glucuronide, which amounted to 501 and 314 micrograms, respectively. Biliary excretion may be the explanation for the noncomplete urinary recovery of ramipril and its metabolites.", 
    "56": "Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia predispose to atherosclerosis. Ramipril, known to lower blood pressure, was used to study the effect of converting-enzyme inhibition on impairment of endothelium-derived relaxation and changes in basal cGMP content in rabbits fed an atherogenic diet (0.25% cholesterol). The generation of cGMP in the presence of bradykinin and ramiprilat was studied in vitro in aortic segments from normal untreated rabbits as well as in bovine endothelial cells. The ability to relax in response to acetylcholine was almost abolished in aortic segments from the vehicle-treated rabbits fed the atherogenic diet for 4 months. The basal cGMP content was substantially reduced. Aortic segments from rabbits concomitantly treated with ramipril (0.3 and 3.0 mg/kg/day) for 3 months showed well-preserved relaxation and matching basal cGMP content compared to normal controls. The relaxation was not significantly greater in aortic segments from ramipril-treated rabbits fed the standard diet, but the cGMP content was more than doubled. In vitro studies in aortic segments and in endothelial cells showed that both the ramiprilat and bradykinin concentrations dependently stimulated cGMP formation, which serves as a biochemical marker of nitric oxide or EDRF release. Thus, the observed endothelial protection against hypercholesterolemia by ramipril may be the result of continuously increased cGMP formation due to preserved EDRF release. This is presumably produced by enhanced bradykinin activity through inhibition of degradation by converting-enzyme inhibition with ramipril.", 
    "57": "The rationale, design, organization, and outcome definitions of the Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) Study are described prospectively. A total of 2,000 patients (1,000 per treatment group) will be recruited to this multicenter, multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of oral treatment with ramipril (2.5 or 5 mg twice daily) on the total mortality of survivors of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with early clinical evidence of heart failure. Secondary outcomes of the study include progression to severe/resistant heart failure (at which time the patient will be withdrawn from the study treatment), reinfarction, and stroke. Treatment will be initiated in hospital between day 3 and day 10 following AMI, and follow-up continued for an average of 15 months and a minimum of 6 months. The study data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis: a single formal interim analysis will be conducted after 175 deaths. An Independent Adjudicating Panel will act as the overall ethical supervisory body for the study and will retain the randomization code. An International Steering Committee will be responsible for the clinical definitions of the secondary study outcomes, and will regularly review progress of the study. We believe that early treatment with ramipril may reduce the total mortality of patients surviving an AMI with clinical evidence of heart failure.", 
    "58": "In the last decade, nucleic acid sequences coding for all three components of the renin-angiotensin cascade have been cloned. This has led to increased understanding of the transcriptional and translational regulation of renin, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This review discusses the impact of the availability of these clones in three clinically relevant areas--the role of the renin-angiotensin system in hypertension, the role of tissue renin-angiotensin systems, and the development of renin inhibitors.", 
    "59": "Calcium antagonists can be used with a number of other antihypertensive compounds. The combined use of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist and beta-blocker is well established and is probably the most efficacious combination for routine use. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may also constitute a suitable addition to calcium antagonist therapy, whereas little benefit appears to be derived from the combined use of a calcium antagonist and a diuretic. Other compounds, e.g., alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, can also be given together with calcium antagonists, although this should be done with great caution because dramatic reductions in blood pressure may result. It is worth noting that in addition to the improved antihypertensive efficacy produced by some of the calcium antagonist combinations, potentially positive metabolic changes may also occur, e.g., a reduction in serum cholesterol, when a calcium antagonist and a beta-blocker are combined.", 
    "60": "To compare the metabolic effects of nifedipine and enalapril, we studied 21 obese patients (BMI of 31.6 +/- 1.1) with mild-to-moderate hypertension and glucose intolerance. None of the patients were receiving insulin or hypoglycemic agents. After a washout period of 15 days, blood pressure was recorded and fasting blood glucose, insulin, and lipid concentrations were determined. At random, 11 patients were started on nifedipine and 10 patients on enalapril. At the 90th day of treatment, clinical and laboratory tests were again performed. Both of the drugs reduced blood pressure values comparably. No significant variation of metabolic parameters was found after 90 days of treatment in the enalapril group. In the nifedipine group, the fasting insulin level was decreased and the glucose/insulin ratio was significantly increased, suggesting an improvement in insulin sensitivity; moreover, total plasma cholesterol was significantly reduced. Enalapril and nifedipine seem to be effective and safe drugs in the treatment of hypertensive subjects with obesity and glucose intolerance. Nifedipine can ameliorate insulin resistance and the lipid state.", 
    "61": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind, double-placebo study in two groups of elderly hypertensive patients aged over 60 years to compare nitrendipine to enalapril, given once daily over 4 months, as monotherapy with 20 mg tablets. Clinic blood pressure was measured monthly and 24 h ambulatory monitoring was obtained at day 0 and day 120. Fifty-two patients entered the study (22 in the nitrendipine group, 30 in the enalapril group); 4 patients in both groups were dropped from the study because they withdrew their consent to participate. Three patients under nitrendipine and five patients under enalapril were not included in the analysis of data because of insufficient follow-up. The two groups were comparable on final analysis. The clinical blood pressure was similarly reduced in both groups at 24 h postdose (172/97 to 157/85 mm Hg on nitrendipine vs. 177/98 to 154/86 mm Hg on enalapril). Seventy percent of the patients had their blood pressure normalized at the end of the study in the two groups. With ambulatory blood pressure recording, no 24 h blood pressure significant differences were found on day 120 when we calculated the mean of systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (137 +/- 12/82 +/- 9 mm Hg on nitrendipine vs. 136 +/- 16/82 +/- 11 mm Hg on enalapril), or for daytime or nighttime periods. The pulse pressure or the mean of the five highest SBP values was also similar in nitrendipine and enalapril patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "In this study, we compared the effects of nitrendipine (20-40 mg daily) and enalapril (20-40 mg daily) in 44 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 4-week placebo period, the patients entered a double-blind, crossover study of 16 weeks, divided by a second 4-week placebo period. Sitting and standing blood pressures (standard mercurymeter) were measured every 2 weeks. Ten patients dropped out, so 34 patients were evaluable. Two patients dropped out because of surgery, one patient was withdrawn because of accelerating hypertension, and seven patients discontinued because of side effects (two on placebo, four on enalapril, and one on nitrendipine). Sitting blood pressures decreased from 172 +/- 3/107 +/- 1 to 159 +/- 3/94 +/- 1 mm Hg on nitrendipine (p less than 0.001) and to 157 +/- 4/96 +/- 2 mm Hg on enalapril (p less than 0.001). The heart rate did not change. Both compounds had no significant effect on serum lipids and on renal function. With regard to side effects, flushing occurred in 10 patients on nitrendipine and in 3 on enalapril (p less than 0.05); cough was noted in 3 patients on enalapril. When using a diastolic pressure less than 95 mm Hg as a response, 72% responded on nitrendipine and 64% on enalapril (n.s.). In conclusion, nitrendipine and enalapril, given as monotherapy, were equally effective antihypertensive agents in this group of patients with uncomplicated, moderate, essential hypertension. The use of either of the tested agents seems to be more limited by its specific side effects than the lack of antihypertensive efficacy.", 
    "63": "As in any patient with hypertension, the first goal in the hypertensive patient with renal disease is to control the hypertension. The second goal is to reduce overall cardiovascular risk, which includes an increased likelihood of coronary events. The third goal is to minimize the likelihood that renal disease will progress, or minimize the rate of progression. There is substantial evidence to indicate that control of hypertension, however achieved, will slow the rate of progression of renal injury and destruction. Studies in animal models have indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are more consistent in preventing progressive renal injury, and perhaps have a more sustained action than standard agents employed hitherto. In the patient with a clear indication for beta-adrenergic blockade, such as a prior coronary event or angina pectoris, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent should be employed. Preliminary, but intriguing, evidence is available to suggest that a beta-adrenergic blocking agent that incorporates a vasodilator action may enjoy special benefits in terms of achieving the three goals. In the case of renal injury, completion of the studies required to prove this point will improve our ability to deal with the problem of hypertension in the patient with renal disease.", 
    "64": "The antihypertensive effects of isradipine and captopril were studied in 231 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in a double-blind, randomized, between-patient trial. Treatment was started with 1.25 mg of isradipine or 12.5 mg of captopril twice daily which, if normotension was not obtained, was increased after 4 weeks to 2.5 mg or 25 mg twice daily, respectively. If the maximum dose of each drug alone did not result in normotension, captopril (12.5 mg or, if necessary, 25 mg twice daily) was added to the isradipine regimen, and isradipine (1.25 mg or, if necessary, 2.5 mg twice daily) to the captopril regimen. Following 24 weeks of active treatment, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced by isradipine (170 +/- 17 vs. 153 +/- 17 mm Hg) and by captopril (170 +/- 19 vs. 155 +/- 19 mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) also fell significantly (p less than 0.001) in both groups (isradipine: 106 +/- 5 vs. 93 +/- 8 mm Hg; captopril: 106 +/- 5 vs. 95 +/- 10 mm Hg). After isradipine as monotherapy, DBP was normalized in 49% of patients compared with 52% after captopril monotherapy. Combination of both drugs increased the normalization rate to 84%. The results indicate that combined treatment with a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is effective in lowering blood pressure, and is well tolerated as long-term therapy.", 
    "65": "We studied the effect of substance P (SP) on the electric properties of cultured canine tracheal epithelium and its possible modulation by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) by Ussing's short-circuited technique in vitro. Addition of SP (5 x 10(-6) M) to the mucosal side increased short-circuit current (SCC) from 5.1 +/- 0.9 to 10.3 +/- 2.2 microA/cm2 (mean +/- SE; p less than 0.01), which was accompanied by increases in transepithelial potential difference and conductance. The effect of the mucosal SP on SCC was dose-dependent, with the maximal increase from the baseline value being 5.8 +/- 1.0 microA/cm2 observed at 5 x 10(-5) M. The NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) did not affect these responses. On the other hand, SCC was not altered by the addition of SP to the submucosal side. However, it was increased dose-dependently in the presence of phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) but not in the presence of captopril, bestatin or leupeptin. This stimulatory effect of submucosal SP was abolished by furosemide, diphenylamine-2-carboxylate and Cl-free medium, but not by amiloride. These results suggest that SP may selectively stimulate Cl secretion across the airway epithelium and that this effect may be modulated by submucosal NEP.", 
    "66": "The physiological effects of the tachykinin peptides substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) are limited by their microenvironmental degradation. We used the isolated tracheally superfused guinea pig lung to examine the importance of various degradative enzymes in limiting the physiological effects of exogenously administered and endogenously released tachykinins. When SP and NKA are administered via the airway epithelium, neutral endopeptidase (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11) is the major degradative enzyme as indicated by the effects of NEP inhibitors alone compared to the effects of a NEP inhibitor along with a cocktail of other peptidase inhibitors. The effects of enzyme inhibitors on physiological responses is mirrored in the amounts of peptide recovered from lung perfusates as determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found similar effects when SP and NKA were released endogenously by the acute infusion of capsaicin. These data indicate that NEP is the predominant degradative enzyme modulating the effects of SP and NKA administered via the airways.", 
    "67": "Enalapril (Renitec, Merck-Sharp-Dohne, Rahway, USA) administered alone (Group I), or in combination (Group II) in a dosage normalizing blood pressure (BP) was investigated for its ability to inhibit adrenergic and serotonergic systems in a one-year study. BP normalization was achieved. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) levels in platelet rich and poor plasma, urinary excretion of 5HT, adrenaline and noradrenaline decreased. Correlations between the changes in BP and the inhibition of serotonergic and adrenergic systems were found in the acute phase in Group I. In chronic effect the reduction of BP correlated with inhibition of the serotonergic system in both groups. Changes in adrenergic and serotonergic systems correlated in the acute phase in both groups; during chronic treatment only in Group II. It is concluded that a concurrent antihypertensive effect and the inhibition of sympathetic activity and 5HT amplifying mechanism (antiatherogenic effect) are of clinical importance for hypertension treatment and prevention of its complications.", 
    "68": "Data on the influence of antihypertensive drug treatment on mortality of hypertensive rats are reviewed. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, verapamil, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril, and a triple combination of reserpine, hydralazine, and chlorothiazide normalized or markedly prolonged survival. Captopril was less effective in sodium chloride-induced, low-renin Dahl rat hypertension. Dihydralazine prolonged but did not nearly normalize survival. The K(+)-channel activator minoxidil was relatively ineffective. Data on diuretics or beta-blockers are insufficient or unavailable. Calcium antagonists nitrendipine and nimodipine and the ACE inhibitor captopril improved survival and prevented vascular lesions and calcinosis even at doses that failed to achieve normotension. All drugs that normalized survival also reduced heart weights. Minoxidil invariably increased heart weights and failed to improve survival. (Di)hydralazine assumed an intermediate position.", 
    "69": "In hypertension, increased systolic blood pressure (BP) and the resulting increase in systolic wall stress are major determinants of the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Antihypertensive drugs all decrease BP, but different classes of these drugs may activate other trophic mechanisms and therefore may have different effects on LVH. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease the major cardiac growth-promoting factors such as systolic wall stress, diastolic wall stress, and cardiac sympathetic and renin activity, and consistently cause regression of LVH. On the other end of the drug spectrum, arterial vasodilators may decrease systolic wall stress, but increase diastolic wall stress and cardiac sympathetic and renin activity, resulting in either the absence of regression or even progression of LVH. Other classes of antihypertensive drugs nonuniformly change neural, humoral, or mechanical stimuli, so that the net effect ranges from full regression, partial regression, to none. Age and reactivity of sympathetic and/or renin activity may play a major role in determining the response of cardiac mass to BP lowering.", 
    "70": "Chronic arterial hypertension (HT) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) increase the morbidity and mortality of acute myocardial infarction in patients. In this article, we discuss earlier studies from Koyanagi et al. in our laboratory that showed that when animals with chronic HT and LVH (HT-LVH) were subjected to acute coronary artery occlusion (CAO), there was a 3.5-fold increase in mortality and a 35% increase in infarct size expressed as a percent of the area at risk. We subsequently determined the effect of HT-LVH on the wavefront of myocardial infarction. Dogs were made hypertensive using a single-kidney, single-clip model of renovascular hypertension that produced mean arterial blood pressure (BP) = 141 +/- 3 mm Hg and left ventricular:body weight = 5.8 +/- 0.1 g/kg (p less than 0.05 vs. control animals). Conscious animals with HT-LVH and control animals were subjected to 1 or 3 h of CAO. Infarct and risk areas were measured using triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain and barium angiography, respectively. The results suggested that the wavefront of infarction was accelerated in animals with HT-LVH. Further studies suggested that the wavefront of myocardial infarction could be markedly retarded by normalizing blood pressure (nitroprusside) 1 h following CAO. Recent studies in an animal model of HT-LVH suggested that electrophysiological abnormalities occur when these animals were subjected to CAO. Sixty-five percent of animals with HT-LVH had sudden death during CAO compared to 27% of the control group. We studied whether chronic beta-adrenergic blockade would reduce mortality associated with CAO in animals with HT-LVH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The aim of this study was to differentiate the effects of changes of arterial pressure from those of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on systolic and diastolic function at rest and during a rapid increase in afterload, induced by handgrip and cold pressor tests. An additional purpose was to assess the hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for the increase in arterial pressure after treatment withdrawal. Therefore, we evaluated the cardiac anatomy and function (TM echo) at rest and during handgrip and cold pressor tests in 23 hypertensive patients, before therapy and 20-30 days after withdrawal of treatment, which had lasted 6-12 months, when left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was significantly reduced (from 140 +/- 44 to 113 +/- 13 g/m2, p less than 0.001) but the arterial pressure had increased again to pretreatment values (166 +/- 19/105 +/- 7 mm Hg before treatment vs. 162 +/- 15/100 +/- 12 mm Hg). The LVMI reduction was due to a decrease in LV wall thickness, whereas the LV internal dimensions did not change. Systolic function was evaluated by the relationship between LV end-systolic stress (ESS) and fractional shortening (FS): at rest as well as at the peak of handgrip and cold pressor tests, highly significant negative correlations between ESS and FS (range of -0.71 to -0.96) were found. Considering each point of relation between ESS and FS in hypertensive patients, in comparison with 95% prediction limits of the correlation obtained in normal subjects, a \"supernormal\" systolic function at rest was observed in 10 of 23 patients and a reduced systolic function was not present after treatment withdrawal and redevelopment of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "The effects of antihypertensive treatment with calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy and the left ventricular function in elderly hypertensive patients were examined. Twenty-four elderly hypertensive patients with cardiac hypertrophy, aged from 65 to 79 years (mean +/- SEM of 71 +/- 1 years), were treated with a calcium antagonist (nifedipine or nicardipine) or ACE inhibitor (captopril or enalapril) for 3 months. Thirteen patients had essential hypertension [EH: systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, aged 70 +/- 1 years] and 11 had isolated systolic hypertension (ISH:SBP greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg and DBP less than 90 mm Hg, aged 74 +/- 2 years). All patients underwent M-mode echocardiography to assess left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left ventricular function (ejection fraction, EF) before and after 3 months of treatment. BP significantly decreased from 174 +/- 3/97 +/- 1 to 144 +/- 5/84 +/- 2 mm Hg in EH and from 167 +/- 3/82 +/- 2 to 144 +/- 4/74 +/- 2 mm Hg in ISH. The LVMI was also significantly reduced from 204 +/- 14 to 174 +/- 16 g/m2 in EH and from 179 +/- 14 to 156 +/- 12 g/m2 in ISH. EF showed no significant changes with treatment in either group. In elderly hypertensive patients, the antihypertensive treatment with calcium antagonist or ACE inhibitor reduced cardiac hypertrophy without any deterioration of left ventricular function in both essential hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "73": "The aim of this study was to assess the behavior of the diastolic left ventricular (LV) filling pattern and cardiac hypertrophy after treatment with cilazapril. Twelve patients (9 male and 3 female) with mild to moderate essential hypertension, aged 46 +/- 14.1 years, were treated with cilazapril for 1 year. They underwent Doppler echocardiography at the beginning (I), after 6 months (II), and after 1 year (III) of treatment. The following parameters were evaluated: mean arterial pressure (MAP) automatically recorded for 24 h, interventricular septal and posterior wall thickness, LV and end-diastolic diameter, LV mass index, early (E) and late (A) diastolic filling flow velocities, and the ratio E/A. A significant reduction in LV hypertrophy and an improved diastolic filling pattern of the left ventricle was shown after 6 months of therapy with cilazapril; this improvement still remained after 1 year of therapy.", 
    "74": "The functional and anatomical abnormalities of the right ventricle may occur in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The present study was designed to assess the functional and structural changes in both left and right ventricles induced by chronic antihypertensive therapy. Doppler and standard echocardiography were performed in 10 hypertensive patients with LVH before and after 1 year of treatment with captopril alone (5 patients) or captopril plus nifedipine (5 patients). We found that the left ventricular mass index and right ventricular thickness were significantly reduced in all patients when compared with pretreatment values. Furthermore, the Doppler-derived diastolic filling indexes show a significant improvement of both ventricular chambers. Our data suggest that anatomical and functional changes induced by therapy in hypertensive patients are not limited to the left ventricle but also involve the right ventricle.", 
    "75": "The hypertrophy of the media of coronary arteries associated with hypertension reduces cross-sectional area and limits vascular reserve. Cilazapril 10 mg/kg daily decreased cardiac hypertrophy, and decreased minimal coronary vascular resistance by 40% when administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at the onset of hypertension. After hypertension had developed, cilazapril restored arterial pressure to normal and increased the maximal coronary blood flow in isolated perfused hearts by 96%, which was probably a result of a marked decrease in medial hypertrophy of the coronary arteries. Similarly, cilazapril improved cerebral vascular reserve in the mesenteric and renal arteries of SHR. In the rat model of vascular injury produced by ballooning, cilazapril 10 mg/kg daily demonstrated a marked preventive effect on the myointimal proliferation that resulted in untreated controls, a phenomenon responsible for restenosis in humans after arterial angioplasty. Although this effect occurred with usual antihypertensive dosages in rats, it appeared to be independent of the decrease in arterial pressure since effective antihypertensive dosages of verapamil did not prevent neointima formation. In view of the clinical potential for preventing restenosis after coronary angioplasty, 2 multicentre trials of cilazapril are ongoing to test this hypothesis.", 
    "76": "The haemodynamic effects of a single dose of cilazapril 2.5 or 5 mg were studied in 33 patients with stable chronic congestive heart failure who were receiving digitalis and diuretics. Subsequently, a double-blind comparison of the haemodynamic and clinical effects of 3 months' treatment with cilazapril 1.25 to 5 mg daily or placebo in 24 evaluable patients revealed that the acute haemodynamic improvement produced by a single dose of cilazapril was maintained in patients receiving repeated administration of the drug, but not in those randomly allocated the placebo. Acute cilazapril significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and right atrial pressure, while cardiac index and stroke volume index increased at rest and during submaximal exercise. After 3 months' treatment 11 of 13 cilazapril recipients improved their New York Heart Association (NYHA) class compared with 2 of 11 patients treated with placebo. This functional improvement was paralleled by a patient-perceived improvement in general well-being.", 
    "77": "The inflammatory effects of enalaprilat and cilazaprilat were tested in an experimental model of ovalbumin-sensitised guinea-pigs. Enalaprilat, but not cilazaprilat, enhanced the ovalbumin-induced inflammatory skin responses. The effect of enalaprilat was dose-dependent. Enalaprilat significantly increased the skin content of substance P and histamine. Cilazaprilat did not alter the level of these inflammatory mediators. Enalaprilat, applied locally, but not cilazaprilat, enhanced the inflammatory reactions caused by intradermal injections of allergen and substance P. Both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enhanced the inflammatory skin response evoked by bradykinin. Our study strongly indicates that enalaprilat has pro-inflammatory properties, whereas the new long-acting ACE inhibitor cilazaprilat does not. This might give a better safety profile of cilazaprilat.", 
    "78": "Sleep-related breathing disorders are associated with considerably impaired vitality and reduced life expectancy. In this respect, a particularly important role is played by obstructive snoring and obstructive or mixed sleep apnoea. Because of the often underestimated prevalence of sleep-related breathing disorders and their association with hypertension in greater than 50% of patients, it is important to introduce antihypertensive drug therapy that does not exacerbate the effects and the degree of these disorders, and that above all produces an adequate lowering of blood pressure by night. In the present study in 12 patients, it has been shown that the new ACE inhibitor, cilazapril, achieves a good reduction in blood pressure over 24 hours and during all stages of sleep, without any negative influence on the ratio of REM: nonREM sleep. The apnoea index was reduced from 40 (range 12 to 84) to 27 (range 0 to 72) apnoeas per hour of sleep (p less than 0.01). It will be increasingly important to take into account the effects of antihypertensive therapy on other clinical parameters, especially the nocturnal blood pressure profile and its association with sleep-related breathing disorders.", 
    "79": "The efficacy of cilazapril monotherapy was evaluated in 2 multicentre double-blind dose-response trials. After 4 weeks of a single-blind placebo run-in period, patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension and a sitting diastolic blood pressure of 100 to 115 mm Hg, 24 hours after the last placebo dose (trough), were randomised to take either placebo or cilazapril 2.5 mg or 5 mg for 4 weeks (study 1, 86 patients) or 8 weeks (study 2, 78 patients). Sitting diastolic blood pressure was checked every 2 weeks at trough in both studies and at peak in study 2. The reductions in sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline at trough, and the difference from placebo, were clinically and statistically significant for both cilazapril groups in the 2 studies. The reduction in blood pressure in both active treatment groups was similar, but the response rate with cilazapril 5 mg was greater than that with 2.5 mg. More than 50% of the peak effect was still present at trough for both cilazapril groups. It is concluded that both dosages of cilazapril are effective and reduce blood pressure compared with placebo over a 24-hour period.", 
    "80": "In clinical pharmacology studies, cilazapril, after its bioactivation to cilazaprilat, was characterised as a potent, reversible angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a terminal half-life of 30 to 50 hours, which is consistent with saturable binding to ACE. Despite the arterial vasodilatation, only slight increases in heart rate occurred during cilazapril administration. Cilazapril had no acute effect on cardiovascular reflexes, and increased effective renal plasma flow slightly. Glomerular filtration rate remained unaltered. A close positive correlation was found between the cilazaprilat plasma concentration and degree of ACE inhibition. The potency of cilazaprit, defined as the concentration of cilazaprilat causing 50% inhibition of ACE, was approximately 1 microgram/L plasma. In short term studies in patients with hypertension, it appeared that more than 90% inhibition of plasma ACE was needed to obtain blood pressure reduction. Results of various dose-response studies established the indirect relationship between dose, the plasma concentration of the drug, and the blood pressure response, and identified the dose producing the maximal effect to be 5mg. Cilazapril inhibited ACE for a relatively long period which was extended in patients with severe chronic renal impairment or hepatic failure. In these patients a reduction of the dose and/or less frequent administration is recommended. There was no clinically relevant interaction of cilazapril with food, furosemide (frusemide), digoxin or coumarins. The effects of hydrochlorothiazide on sodium and chloride excretion were potentiated by cilazapril, and an additive effect of propranolol and nitrendipine on the blood pressure response to cilazapril was observed. An interaction with indomethacin and cilazapril might occur, potentially reducing the blood pressure-lowering effect of cilazapril. In general, cilazapril was well tolerated.", 
    "81": "Angiotensin II has many actions in the kidney, including regulation and distribution of renal circulation and glomerular filtration, as well as effects on mesangial contraction and on the filtration coefficient. The reduction in circulating and intrarenal angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in essential hypertension is associated with a significant increase in renal blood flow and a decrease in filtration fraction, without changes in glomerular filtration rate. In addition, administration of ACE inhibitors can reduce proximal sodium reabsorption via changes in peritubular hydrostatic and oncotic forces resulting from the fall in postglomerular capillary resistance. In severe hypertension the state of the renal vasculature does not allow ACE inhibition to induce similar haemodynamic changes and, therefore, it cannot contribute to renal sodium handling that requires the recruitment of alternate mechanisms. In spite of this, ACE inhibitors may exert a protective effect on the renal function of patients with severe hypertension as well as in those with renal impairment, by lowering systemic and, probably, intraglomerular pressure, reducing proteinuria and slowing the progression of renal failure.", 
    "82": "Cilazapril is a new nonthiol group containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which was designed by a computer-modelling technique in order to obtain a compound with high specificity and selectivity for the target enzyme. Cilazapril has been investigated in more than 4000 patients with all degrees of hypertension, as well as in the special patient groups such as the elderly, renally impaired, and patients with concomitant diseases, such as congestive cardiac failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In these studies, the blood pressure-lowering effect of a single daily dose has been clearly established. The tolerability profile is similar to other frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs, such as sustained-release propranolol, enalapril, captopril, atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide. Recently, investigations have revealed that cilazapril, in addition to its blood pressure-lowering abilities, can moderate the proliferative response seen in vessels after vascular injury caused by techniques such as ballooning. Clinical studies to verify these findings are currently ongoing.", 
    "83": "We evaluated the degree of inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), principally by cilazapril, by assessing the blood pressure response to a continuous infusion of increasing doses of angiotensin I, and assessed the possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between cilazapril and propranolol in healthy volunteers and patients with mild to severe essential hypertension. The specificity of the angiotensin I infusion method was verified when a single dose of cilazapril 30mg antagonised the increase in diastolic blood pressure induced by angiotensin I but did not influence the response to angiotensin II. Using this method, we showed that single oral doses of cilazapril 4 mg, captopril 25 mg and enalapril 10mg shifted the angiotensin I dose-effect curve to the right and determined a pharmacological half-life of about 4 hours for cilazapril. Increasing single oral doses (1.25, 3.75, 10 and 30mg) of cilazapril reduced diastolic blood pressure dose-dependently and shifted the angiotensin I dose-response curves to the right. The dose representing 50% inhibition of ACE activity (apparent Ki-dose) was about 0.6mg, 3 hours after cilazapril administration. Cilazapril and propranolol did not exhibit any clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction in healthy volunteers; each drug reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure by about 7 mm Hg, and this was doubled by the combination. Cilazapril had no significant effect on heart rate, in patients with essential hypertension whereas both propranolol and the combination of cilazapril and propranolol reduced it. Monotherapy with each drug reduced blood pressure, and combined administration enhanced the antihypertensive effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "Cilazapril (CLZ) is a new, long-acting nonsulfhydril converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I). Its effect on peak and trough sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was studied in a total of 85 patients with uncomplicated, essential hypertension at three centers. After 4 weeks of a single-blind placebo (PLA) run-in period, patients whose SDBP was between 100 and 115 mm Hg, were randomized into active treatment with either PLA (n = 27), CLZ 2.5 mg (n = 29), or CLZ 5 mg (n = 29) once daily in a double-blind fashion for another 8 weeks. At the end of the PLA run-in and after 4 and 8 weeks active therapy, an hourly blood pressure (BP) profile during 1-10 and 21-24 h postdose was performed. The drop in SDBP at the end of the active treatment period at peak and trough was statistically and clinically significant for both CLZ doses in comparison with the PLA group. The peak/trough ratio after subtraction of the PLA effect was 62% for CLZ 2.5 mg and 59% for CLZ 5 mg. These results indicate that the dose regimen of CLZ 2.5-5 mg once daily is adequate and effective for 24 h.", 
    "85": "Chronic hypoxia is known to be associated with a thickening of the media of pulmonary arteries. The goal of the present study was to assess if cilazapril, a novel long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, could prevent this thickening. For this purpose, three groups of rats were studied. One group was kept in normal room air. Two other groups were exposed to chronic hypoxia (inspired fraction of oxygen equal to 8% during 4 weeks). One group of hypoxic rats was treated with placebo and the other group received cilazapril (as food admixture of approximately 3 mg/kg/day). After 4 weeks, rats were anesthetized and pulmonary artery pressure and hematocrit measured. Then, the lungs were perfused and fixed and morphometry of the pulmonary arteries was performed. Hypoxia induced an increase in pulmonary artery pressure and hematocrit associated with a dramatic increase in the thickness of the media of the pulmonary arteries. Cilazapril completely prevented the thickening of the media of the pulmonary arteries but did not significantly decrease the pulmonary artery pressure or right ventricular weight.", 
    "86": "The effect of various antihypertensive medications on platelet function is of increasing interest. Conflicting effects of captopril on platelet function are reported and the impact of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not containing a sulfhydryl group such as enalapril, lisinopril, and quinapril on platelet function remains unstudied. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of antihypertensive treatment with quinapril, a novel ACE inhibitor not containing a sulfhydryl group, on platelet function. Ten white men (age range of 32-61 years) with untreated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg) were treated with 4 weeks each of placebo and quinapril in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Quinapril (20 mg twice a day) significantly lowered systolic (p less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.01) without any significant effect on heart rate or plasma catecholamines. No significant change was noted for in vitro platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine, ADP, or collagen. Plasma concentrations of the platelet release factors beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 did not change, nor did the platelet content of norepinephrine, platelet weight (mg/10 ml of blood), circulating platelet count, or platelet size. Thus, as assessed by a broad spectrum of platelet parameters, we found that antihypertensive treatment with quinapril has no significant effect on platelet function in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. These \"platelet-neutral\" properties of quinapril suggest that quinapril, both from a thromboembolic and a hemostatic point of view, may be a rather safe agent for treatment of hypertension.", 
    "87": "Using paired isolated perfused rat tail artery segments, it was found that enalaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, augmented 1.6-fold the contractile responses to phenylephrine (PE), an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist. Similarly, enalaprilat potentiated 1.9-fold the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist activity of doxazosin in paired rat tail artery segments. In rats treated with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) 20 mg/kg i.m. twice weekly for 5 weeks, plasma renin activity fell from a control value of 5.73 +/- 0.93 to 0.04 +/- 0.01 ng of AI/ml/h. The inhibition of circulating renin activity in these animals was associated with a loss of the potentiating effects of enalaprilat upon the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist action of doxazosin. The results are interpreted as indicating that angiotensin II (AII) can modulate the functional activity of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "88": "The effects of pretreatment with enalapril, and sulindac, on the weal response to intradermal injections of substance P and neurokinin A were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Weal responses to both substance P and neurokinin A depended significantly on dose. Neither enalapril nor sulindac, nor the combination of these agents influenced the responses to either tachykinin. These results do not suggest any role for substance P or neurokinin A in the clinical effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "89": "The prerequisite for rational therapy of male fertility disorders is an exact diagnosis. While the possibilities of influencing disturbances of spermiogenesis are limited, male adnexal diseases can be successfully treated in many cases. Drugs for the treatment of fertility disorders must be applied with this in mind, and empiric therapy is often performed in addition to causal treatment which, however, may be quite rationally determined. The therapeutic spectrum in andrology includes antibiotic and antiphlogistic agents, mast cell blockers, zinc, vitamins, and immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids). These agents are used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the testes and the accessory glands or for suppression of antispermatozoal antibodies. Hormonal disturbances are infrequently encountered by the andrologist, but they can be treated, with proven efficacy, with gonadotrophins, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or androgens. In certain cases that are not hormonally related, the use of antiestrogens (clomifene, tamoxifen) as stimulating agents may be successful. Furthermore, tissue hormone releasing proteases (kallikrein) can be used both therapeutically (especially in motility disturbances that are not due to structural flagellar defects) and diagnostically (in order to distinguish between inflammatory and noninflammatory testicular damage). Anticholinergics and alpha-sympathomimetics are applied to ameliorate ejaculation or emission failure. In addition to a review of these treatment forms, the development of new concepts, e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, is discussed.", 
    "90": "Beta-blockers were initially given to patients with chronic heart failure due to ischemic heart disease and resting tachycardia. The prompt effect on severe backward heart failure was directly associated with an immediate fall in heart rate. This observation led to long-term administration to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and, later, to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and secondary cardiomyopathies as well. Due to marked down-regulation of beta receptors, patients with heart failure are extremely sensitive to beta blockade. A test dose of metoprolol 5 mg b.i.d. for 2 days is recommended to select patients for long-term beta-blockade, followed by careful titration with increment in dose over 6 weeks. One important effect of beta-blockade in the early phase of treatment is a reduction in the myocardial energy demand early after the onset of long-term treatment. After 1 month of treatment with beta-blockers, marked improvement of diastolic function is observed. This effect might be attributed to inhibition of calcium overload. After 3 months of treatment, an increase in ejection fraction can be observed, which might be attributed to upregulation of beta receptors. The withdrawal of long-term treatment was followed by a deterioration of heart function in 61% of patients and improvement was seen after reinstitution of beta-blockade. There was an increase in cardiac index and stroke work index at rest as well as during supine exercise. A marked fall in left ventricular filling pressure at rest and unchanged filling pressure during supine exercise was noted, while exercise capacity increased by 25%. A similar pattern was seen in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathies and other secondary cardiomyopathies. However, the increase in ejection fraction in the ischemic cardiomyopathy group was lower (0.06) compared to the groups with dilated cardiomyopathy and other secondary cardiomyopathies (0.18).", 
    "91": "To investigate the effects of antihypertensive drugs on hemodynamic and sympathetic nerve responses to exercise, graded ergometer exercise tests were performed before and after two-week administration of nifedipine, captopril and metoprolol in 18 patients with essential hypertension. The arterial pressure, heart rates (HR), and left ventricular functions as obtained by echocardiography, and the plasma norepinephrine (PNE) levels, were evaluated at rest and during submaximal exercise before and after two-week treatment with nifedipine (40 mg/day, 5 cases), captopril (37.5-75 mg/day, 6 cases) and metoprolol (60 mg/day, 7 cases). These 3 drugs significantly reduced systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures but caused no significant changes in resting PNE levels. Nifedipine produced no significant changes in HR and cardiac output (CO) at rest, but augmented the increase in HR (delta HR) and SBP (delta SBP) during submaximal exercise. The increase in PNE (delta PNE) was also augmented by nifedipine. Captopril reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume and CO without changes in HR and fractional shortening (FS) at rest; whereas, it did not affect delta HR, delta CO, delta SBP or delta PNE during exercise. Metoprolol reduced HR and CO at rest, and also resulted in a decrease in delta FS and delta CO during submaximal exercise. delta SBP was unchanged and delta PNE was increased by treatment with metoprolol. These results indicate that, in hypertensive subjects, the effects on the hemodynamic and sympathetic nerve responses to exercise are different among these 3 antihypertensive drugs despite their identical effects on blood pressure.", 
    "92": "The effect of beta-blocking agents and enalapril as antihypertensive drugs has been compared in 47 patients with IgA nephropathy. The deterioration rate was calculated from the regression line of 51Cr-EDTA clearance and expressed in ml/min/year. The annual loss in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was greater in patients treated with different beta-blocking agents (-4.9 +/- 6.8 ml/min/year) compared to patients treated with Enalapril (1.7 +/- 7.4 ml/min/year), in spite of the fact that these patients had a lower initial GFR. Nine patients were initially treated with beta-blocking agents (-9.5 +/- 9.3 ml/min/year) and then with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (5.5 +/- 11.2 ml/min/year). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should therefore be preferred in the treatment of hypertension in IgA nephropathy.", 
    "93": "The aim of this 3-month double-blind multicenter trial was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of the ACE inhibitor perindopril with those of a diuretic combination. After 1 month of receiving placebo, 165 patients with essential hypertension were randomised to perindopril 4 mg (n = 82) or to 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide + 5 mg amiloride (n = 83). The patients were treated for 3 months with monthly assessments, \"uncontrolled\" patients (DBP greater than 90 mm Hg) had their dosage doubled and then, if necessary, atenolol 50 mg was added. At the end of the 3-month study, mean decreases in supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar in both groups. In the perindopril group, BP control was obtained in 56% of the patients with the 4 mg dosage and required an increase to 8 mg alone in 16% and with atenolol in 5%. The corresponding percentages in the diuretic group were 48, 23 and 13%. The overall percentage of \"controlled\" patients was similar in the 2 groups, respectively 78 and 84%. The nature and incidence of complaints were comparable in the 2 groups. Adverse laboratory changes were more frequent in the diuretic group: decrease in blood sodium (140.5 vs 139.1 mmol/l; P less than 0.01), potassium (4.2 vs 3.9 mmol/l; P less than 0.01) with 10 patients having significant hypokalemia, increase in blood urea, triglycerides and uric acid. By contrast, a transient increase in blood potassium with a decrease in triglycerides was observed in the perindopril group.", 
    "94": "Normal individuals have time-dependent variations in cardiovascular function, most of which are circadian (once daily). They include changes in heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, blood volume, and viscosity. There are also changes in neuroendocrine function, including the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and the renin-angiotensin system. These variations have important consequences for the heart, since haemodynamic and neuroendocrine alterations determine cardiac work load; heart rate, blood pressure, and sympathetic nervous system activity are highest during the waking hours and lowest during sleep. Cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are associated with these changes. Patients with congestive heart failure undergo changes in neurohumoral cardiovascular regulation that increase the work load of the heart as a result of increases in heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance. Moreover, a normal circadian variation is lost, causing blood pressure and heart rate to remain increased at night, depriving the heart of a period of rest. In addition, these patients have an ability to increase blood flow to exercising skeletal muscle, limiting exercise tolerance, as well as the consequences of elevated ventricular filling pressures. These time-dependent variations in the pathophysiological processes of congestive heart failure have implications for pharmacological therapy. In particular, vasodilator therapy should be administered to provide optimal unloading of the heart throughout the day. Vasodilator therapy should also provide antagonism to those factors that limit blood flow to working skeletal muscle, so that the physical ability is not intermittently compromised during the trough effect of the drug. Criteria for establishing the efficacy of drugs for the treatment of congestive heart failure should include an analysis of peak and trough effects.", 
    "95": "Elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure in the elderly is a problem the extent of which may be somewhat overstated. In those elderly with definite hypertension, pathophysiology may differ from that of younger counterparts. The contribution of elevated plasma renin activity to hypertension and to the choice of therapy also appears to be exaggerated. The risks of ignoring hypertension in the elderly are similar to those in younger patients, and therefore excessively elevated blood pressure should no longer be considered a normal consequence of aging. Notably, elevated systolic pressure is a better predictor of future adverse occurrences than is elevated diastolic pressure. Unfortunately, there is no well defined therapeutic regimen to manage isolated systolic hypertension. Conservative reduction of elevated systolic and diastolic pressures may nevertheless be accomplished safely and effectively. Individualization of therapy is recommended based primarily on concomitant disease(s). Thus no single agent or combination of agents is preferable in all elderly hypertensive patients. Aggressive use of non-pharmacologic therapy preferably precedes judicious of antihypertensive medication. Aggressive blood pressure reduction with potent drugs is not recommended.", 
    "96": "Congestive heart failure has emerged as an important public health problem world wide. It is the single most common cause for hospitalization of patients over the age of 65 years in the United States. The past decade has witnessed the completion of a number of clinical trials which have been helpful in formulating treatment strategies for patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have emerged as distinctly useful pharmacologic therapy for this condition, and digitalis and diuretics are still widely used. New clinical trials are being planned and conducted to further refine our knowledge of treatment. Future studies are likely to be focused on understanding how myocardial damage begins and progresses to end-stage heart failure, and how early therapy may prevent the advanced stages of the disease.", 
    "97": "To clarify the contribution made by the renin-angiotensin system activation to the short lived hypotensive response to fenoldopam, the haemodynamic effects of a combination of fenoldopam (100 mg) and enalapril (5 mg) were compared with fenoldopam alone, enalapril alone and placebo in a balanced, randomised, double blind, single dose study in eight hypertensive patients. Fenoldopam caused an acute fall in blood pressure which lasted approximately 3 h after dosing and was associated with a reflex tachycardia. Enalapril caused a more gradual fall in blood pressure (onset 2 h) without a reflex tachycardia. The combination of drugs produced greater reductions in blood pressure sustained for a longer period than fenoldopam alone and with a more rapid onset than enalapril alone. In combination the hypotensive effects of fenoldopam and enalapril were clearly additive and not synergistic. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system does not antagonise significantly the hypotensive effect of fenoldopam.", 
    "98": "In the present study, we have evaluated the effect of both facilitatory beta 2-adrenoceptor and angiotensin II receptor on the release of adrenal catecholamines induced by electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerve in anaesthetized and vagotomized dog. In these experiments, individual or combined treatments with the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (2 mg/kg i.v.), or the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin (2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 i.v.) were found to significantly decrease the release of adrenal catecholamines during splanchnic nerve stimulation (5-V pulses of 2 ms duration for 3 min at 1 Hz) whatever the order of administration of the drugs. On the other hand, the infusion of angiotensin II (20 ng.kg-1.min-1) was shown to potentiate the release of adrenal catecholamines in response to electrical stimulation, and this effect was totally blocked by treatment with saralasin (4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 i.v.). This facilitating angiotensin mechanism differed from beta-adrenoceptor facilitating mechanism, since following beta-blockade with ICI 118551, angiotensin II infusion still significantly potentiated the release of catecholamines during splanchnic nerve stimulation. These observations thus suggest that both facilitating beta 2-adrenoceptors and angiotensin II receptors can independently modulate the release of adrenal catecholamines.", 
    "99": "Six children presented with severe hypertension caused by Takayasu's arteritis (TA), of whom four had bilateral renal artery narrowing and two coarctation syndrome. Two presented with hypertensive encephalopathy and four with congestive cardiac failure. All had a strongly positive skin reactions to purified protein derivative of mycobacterium tuberculosis. Bilateral renal arterial bypass grafts performed in two children resulted in prolonged normalization of their blood pressures, but the grafts clotted 12-18 months later. Primary renal autotransplantation was unsuccessful in two children, one with bilateral renal arterial narrowing and iliac vessel involvement and one with a long coarctation. Secondary renal autotransplantation was successful in a third child with localized aortitis. A successful aortic patch graft was performed in one child with coarctation of the aorta. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors should be used with caution in treating the hypertension caused by TA, since bilateral renal arterial narrowing is common and their administration may result in renal insufficiency. The long-term prognosis is guarded in severely hypertensive children with extensive vascular disease due to TA.",

After a single dose of [14C]MDL 27,210 (3 mg/kg iv), MDL 27,210 was rapidly eliminated from the plasma of monkeys and dogs with a terminal half-life of approximately 0.3 hr. The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.15 liter/kg in dogs and 0.28 liter/kg in monkeys. Monkeys excreted 52% of the 14C dose in the feces and 41% in the urine; dogs excreted 80% of the 14C dose in the feces and 14% in the urine. The presence of a large fraction of the 14C dose in the feces of both species following iv administration suggests that significant biliary excretion occurred. MDL 27,210 administered iv to monkeys and dogs was rapidly and extensively (greater than 99.9%) metabolized, primarily to its diacid metabolite, MDL 27,088. The half-life of MDL 27,088 was 2.2 hr in dogs and 3.6 hr in monkeys.", 
    "101": "1. The relationship of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity to changes in the extent of angiotensin I (ANG I) conversion in vivo in rats with short-term and chronic (8 weeks) hypertension was examined. 2. Plasma ACE activity was measured by a fluorimetric assay and the extent of ANG I conversion was calculated from the equipressor doses of ANG I and ANG II in conscious rats. 3. The extent of ANG I conversion was higher in chronic one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats than in the normotensive age-matched control rats (64.1 +/- 3.6% vs 34.8 +/- 5.2%), while no difference was found in the ACE activity measured in plasma from both groups. 4. In rats with acute hypertension, produced upon unclamping the renal pedicle occluded for 5 hours, the extent of ANG I conversion was increased when compared to the period prior to renal pedicle occlusion (from 38.8 +/- 4.1% to 68.6 +/- 8.5%), and plasma ACE activity remained unchanged. 5. These results indicate that circulating ACE cannot be used as an index of ANG I conversion in vivo and support the proposal that tissue ACE is responsible for the augmented ANG I conversion observed in vivo in both acute renal hypertension and chronic one-kidney, one clip hypertension.",

The addition of Lisinopril produced approximately two-fold reductions in blood pressure compared to Isradipine alone, increasing the responder rate of the original cohort of 50 subjects by 18% and normalization rate, by 32%. No significant changes in haematological or biochemical parameters, CXR or ECG, were observed.

    "104": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a central participant in blood pressure regulation and is strategically located within the pulmonary vasculature in order to carry out this function. It is also present in kidney, brain and a variety of other tissues where its function is unknown. The molecular weight of ACE from these sources is approximately 185,000. A smaller form of the enzyme, Mr approximately 100,000, is found in mature testis; its function is also unknown. The lung form of human ACE contains 1277 amino acids and consists of two homologous repeated domains, each of which appears to have a potential catalytic site. The testis form of human ACE contains 701 amino acids and has only a single domain which is largely identical to the carboxy-terminal half of the lung enzyme. This raises important questions such as, why does lung ACE possess two possible active sites, do each of the two bind zinc, and are they both catalytically active? To answer these questions, we have examined the binding of potent peptide inhibitors to ACE, redetermined the zinc stoichiometry and chemically modified both lung and testicular ACE with fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB). Peptide inhibitors bind with essentially a 1:1 stoichiometry, indicative of a single active site. The zinc content of lung ACE is 1.4-1.8 g-at/mol. For testicular ACE it is 0.8-1.1 g-at/mol. FDNB modifies a single tyrosine, and to a much lesser extent a lysine, with concomitant loss of all catalytic activity. Sequence analysis identifies the specific residues modified and indicates that they occur only in the carboxy terminal half of lung ACE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "105": "We studied the effects of acute and chronic in vivo inhibition of acetylcholinesterase on both the density and function of brain muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Adult male rats were treated either once or multiple times over a period of 10 days with the irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). The concentration and affinity of muscarinic receptors in various brain regions were determined using radioligand binding techniques. Acute DFP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in receptor number only in the brain stem, while chronic treatment caused receptor down-regulation in the brain stem, cerebral cortex, and striatum. There was no change in ligand affinity in any of the brain regions. In sharp contrast, muscarinic receptor function was fully preserved, in terms of coupling of the receptors to increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, or inhibition of cyclic AMP formation in the cerebral cortex or striatum. Therefore, there is a marked lack or correlation between DFP-induced muscarinic receptor down-regulation and receptor desensitization.", 
    "106": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a peptidyldipeptide hydrolase that is located mainly on the luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells but also in cells derived from the monocyte-macrophage system. Physiologically, ACE is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system, converting angiotensin I into the potent vasopressor angiotensin II and also inactivating the vasodilator bradykinin. Increased serum ACE activity (SACE) has been reported in pathologies involving a stimulation of the monocytic cell line, primarily granulomatous diseases. Sarcoidosis is the most frequent and the better studied of these diseases; high SACE is not only a well-established marker for the diagnosis but is also a useful tool for following its course and evaluating the effect of therapy. SACE can also be increased in nonsarcoidotic pulmonary granulomatous diseases such as silicosis and asbestosis, in extrathoracic granulomatous pathologies such as Gauchers disease and leprosis, and, to a lesser extent, in nongranulomatous disorders such as hyperthyroidism or cholestasis. On the other hand, monitoring sarcoidosis obviates the measurement of ACE activity in other biological fluids, e.g., broncho-alveolar and cerebrospinal fluids, in the search of a locoregional dissemination or dis-simulation of the disease. Decreased SACE has been reported in vascular pathologies involving an endothelial abnormality, e.g., deep vein thrombosis, and in endothelium dysfunctions related to the toxicity of chemo- and radiotherapy used in cancers, leukemias, and hematopoietic or organ transplantations. SACE is also of interest for monitoring arterial hypertension treated with specific synthetic ACE inhibitors. These various reasons for determining ACE activity have led to the development of numerous methods. The most widely used is the spectrophotometric assay using hippuryl-histidyl-leucine as substrate. Fluorimetric and radiochemical assays using both classic and novel substrates have been proposed, but they are time consuming, require special apparatus, and are not suited to automation. Kinetic spectrophotometry of furylacryloyl-phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine hydrolysis is now used extensively because it is easy to automatize. Efforts are now required to standardize one or more of these assays. Indeed, \"normal\" plasma values differ not only according to the substrate, but also to the method of determination and to sex and age.",

All patients were evaluated in basal conditions for creatinine clearance, protidaemia, proteinuria, SACE and serum electrolytes. All but one patient had a renal biopsy. After basal evaluation nine patients received enalapril, 10 mg/die, for two weeks. After one week SACE levels were re-evaluated, while the proteinuria was re-evaluated several times during the two weeks of treatment.

In certain disease states, particularly arterial hypertension, components of the hypertrophic remodelling process, other than myocyte growth, distort myocardial structure and thereby adversely alter its mechanical behaviour. Such a pathologic structural remodelling includes a perivascular and interstitial fibrosis that impairs myocardial stiffness and a medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries that attenuates its vasodilator reserve to ischaemic and pharmacologic provocation. The concept of cardioreparation embodies both a regression in myocyte hypertrophy and the pathologic components of the structurally remodelled myocardium and in so doing restores structure and function to normal. Implicit in this concept is the supposition that heart failure will be reversible. The concept of reparation was tested in 14-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats having left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction with myocardial fibrosis, and impaired coronary vascular reserve to adenosine, using the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. A regression in left ventricular hypertrophy, perivascular and interstitial fibrosis, and medial thickening of intramural vessels were obtained after 12 weeks of oral lisinopril administration. It would now seem logical to determine whether cardioreparation can be achieved with lisinopril in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, in whom pathologic remodelling of the myocardium is responsible for symptomatic heart failure.", 
    "110": "Local tissue-resident renin-angiotensin systems are increasingly recognized as important elements of neurohumoral mediation which may act in concert with, but also independently of, the circulating system. The presence of such a system within the heart is of particular interest; current evidence supporting its existence, functional integration, and physiopathological importance as well as the role which its pharmacological modulation may play are reviewed. The elements of the catalytic cascade, renin, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, have all been demonstrated in cardiac tissues; both at the protein level and (with the exception of converting enzyme) with regard to local expression of the respective genes. Modulation of gene expression in response to various perturbations has been demonstrated and may occur independently of the plasma or other tissue renin-angiotensin systems. In isolated hearts the generation of biologically active peptides, angiotensins I and II, has been documented, establishing the capability of this system to act as an independently regulated, functionally integrated catalytic pathway for the production of angiotensin II. Activation of either angiotensinogen to angiotensin I or of angiotensin I to angiotensin II is dose dependently inhibited by the administration of renin inhibitors and converting enzyme inhibitors, respectively. Through specific receptors, present in the heart as in other tissues, angiotensin mediates profound effects on cardiomyocyte function and, as we are beginning to learn, on structure and growth. We now have strong evidence that converting enzyme inhibition at a tissue level may profoundly influence and modulate these actions of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system, particularly in the setting of myocardial ischaemia. This may, in the future, open up new vistas for the application of converting enzyme inhibitors and their indications in a widening spectrum of cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "111": "A large co-ordinated multinational clinical-trial programme in hypertension has provided comparative data on adverse events in patients on lisinopril (n = 318) compared with enalapril (n = 321) and in 230 patients on lisinopril versus captopril (n = 235). The three groups were demographically well matched with regard to age and duration of treatment. However, in comparison with the lisinopril group, the captopril-treated group had a slightly higher proportion of males (NS). The incidence of adverse events on lisinopril was similar to that on enalapril (10.4 vs. 8.7%, NS) and captopril (11.7 vs. 11.9%, NS). The incidence of withdrawals was similar on lisinopril and enalapril (1.9 vs. 1.9%, NS) and captopril (4.8 vs. 3.0%, NS). The most frequently reported events affected the digestive, respiratory, or nervous and psychiatric systems of the body. The pattern of events and withdrawals was similar for all three drugs. The incidence of laboratory changes for lisinopril versus enalapril and lisinopril versus captopril was similar. The safety profiles of all three drugs were comparable in young and elderly patients. First-dose hypotension was reported for 2 of 548 patients on lisinopril, and renal failure was reported for 3 of 286 patients on enalapril. Overall, the events reflected the class-specific effects previously identified for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The data indicate that long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not impose any additional side-effect risk in hypertension.", 
    "112": "We have conducted a multicentre study in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Lisinopril monotherapy, 10, 20, or 40 mg once daily (n = 35), was compared with captopril monotherapy, 25, 50, or 100 mg twice daily (n = 35). Blood pressure assessments were conducted using both office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Area under the curve analysis of ambulatory blood pressure reductions demonstrated significant differences between once-daily lisinopril and twice-daily captopril, with lisinopril producing the most significant reduction in pressure. These therapeutic results reflect the clinical-pharmacological profile of these two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and provide important clinical implications.", 
    "113": "Angiotensin converting enzyme is localized in the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brain by in vitro autoradiography using the radiolabelled inhibitor, [125I]351A. This radioligand binds with high affinity and specificity to monkey cortical sections. Specific inhibitors of converting enzyme, lisinopril and perindoprilat complete for the radioligand binding to monkey cortex sections with inhibitory constants of 10 nM. High concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in most components of the basal ganglia including the caudate nucleus, putamen, the internal and external globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum and the reticular part of the substantia nigra. The distribution of converting enzyme in the caudate nucleus and putamen is heterogeneous, with prominent patches of higher activity. The patches in the caudate nucleus correspond closely with the acetylcholinesterase-poor striosomes. In the hypothalamus, very high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in the median eminence and the pituitary stalk and high concentrations occur in the supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei. Moderate, diffuse binding is observed in the median preoptic nucleus, the medial preoptic area, and in the anterior, lateral, ventromedial, posterior and arcuate nuclei. In the circumventricular organs, the subcommissural and subfornical organs exhibit high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme. The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the pineal body display moderate enzyme activities whereas the area postrema is devoid of labelling. The interpeduncular nucleus and, in the hippocampal formation, the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus are also intensely labelled. High levels of angiotensin converting enzyme activity are also detected throughout the cerebral cortex with laminations of higher activity corresponding to cell dense layers of the cortex. Layered binding is also present in the cerebellar cortex, with the most intense labelling in the molecular layer. Moderate concentrations of converting enzyme also occur in the paraventricular, medial habenula, lateral habenula and central median nuclei of the thalamus, the amygdala, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the parabrachial nucleus and dorsal tegmental nucleus. The dorsal vagal complex, inferior olivary nucleus and the caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus all display high levels of binding. Moderate, diffuse labelling is found throughout the reticular region and is also present in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. Although the overall distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme in the monkey brain resembles that in the rat, there are some striking differences. These include the high levels of binding throughout the monkey cerebral cortex and in the interpeduncular and suprachiasmatic nuclei.", 
    "114": "To test the hypothesis that angiotensin II (Ang II) in the central nervous system modulates catecholamine-induced cardiac arrhythmias and to determine whether endogenous opioids are operative in this action, arrhythmias were produced in male Wistar rats, by continuous infusion of epinephrine at incremental doses until the development of fatal arrhythmias that were usually ventricular fibrillation. Rats were instrumented with catheters in the lateral cerebral ventricle, femoral vein and femoral artery. Ang II, 0.5 microgram, in the lateral cerebral ventricle (ICV) markedly and significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the epinephrine dose, at the occurrence of ventricular premature beats compared to the control group 228 +/- 11 (SEM) vs 116 +/- 7 micrograms epinephrine/kg and at the onset of fatal arrhythmias 225 +/- 13 vs 185 +/- 9 micrograms epinephrine/kg. Ang II, 0.5 microgram i.v., did not affect arrhythmia threshold. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, 1 mg/kg, decreased arrhythmia threshold as ventricular arrhythmias were first noted at 106 +/- 4 and fatal arrhythmias occurred at 118 +/- 4 micrograms epinephrine/kg. The Ang II receptor antagonist saralasin 150 micrograms/kg ICV, blunted and 300 micrograms/kg ICV reversed the effect of Ang II. The mu opioids antagonist naloxone and the kappa opioid antagonist MR 2266, 50 micrograms/kg ICV, prevented the effect of Ang II on fatal arrhythmias. The action Ang II on arrhythmias could not be explained by the effects of Ang II on blood pressure or heart rate. These data indicate a role for Ang II within the CNS to modulate cardiac arrhythmias and that this is mediated in part, by endogenous opioids.", 
    "115": "The chemiluminescence reaction elicited from luminol in the presence of hydroxyl radicals was concentration-dependently suppressed by captopril, indicating efficacious radical scavenging. As to be expected, ACE inhibitors lacking free sulfhydryl groups (ramipril, enalapril) were inactive. However, the endogenous scavenger and anti-oxidant uric acid proved to be far superior to captopril, when concentrations of both were compared that are realized in vivo. A substantial augmentation of endogenous scavenging ability during therapy with captopril thus seems unlikely. In a model of standardized myocardial hypoxia (isolated working heart of the guinea pig with 30 min low flow perfusion) captopril, ramiprilat and uric acid equally improved post-hypoxic heart function. There was no cardioprotective action of captopril in excess of that accountable for by inhibition of ACE. It seems possible that ACE (kininase II) inhibitors exert cardioprotection via elevated tissue levels of kinins: bradykinin also improved heart performance after low flow perfusion and bradykinin-induced coronary dilatation was markedly enhanced in the presence of ramiprilate, reflecting attenuated degradation by endothelial kininase II.", 
    "116": "In order to investigate renin- and angiotensin-independent mechanisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril we examined the effects of ramiprilat on calcium mobilization in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Ramiprilat (10(-7) M) induced a slow increase of basal [Ca2+]i from 52 +/- 7 nM to 162 +/- 12 nM (p less than .001). This increase of basal [Ca2+]i was associated with contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells as assessed by microscopy in vitro. While ramiprilat itself induced an increase of basal [Ca2+]i, the Ca(2+)-mobilizing effect of angiotensin II (AII) was blunted in the presence of the ACE inhibitor (659 +/- 38 nM vs 360 +/- 45 nM, p less than .001). The calcium channel blocker verapamil did not affect the stimulatory effect of ramiprilat on basal [Ca2+]i. The intracellular Ca2+ antagonist TMB 8 attenuated the ramiprilat-induced increase of basal [Ca2+]i (162 +/- 12 nM vs 101 +/- 14 nM, p less than .05). In the present study, the effect of ramiprilat on [Ca2+]i was not blocked by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by meclofenamate (10(-5) M); however, this finding does not rule out in vivo effects of ramiprilat-stimulated prostaglandins. These results suggest that ramipril affects Ca2+ kinetics in vascular smooth muscle cells. Ramiprilat-induced contraction of cultured smooth muscle cells may not be relevant in vivo, but the increase of basal [Ca2+]i by ramiprilat may reflect a \"reset\" of the cellular Ca(2+)-mobilizing mechanism or a depletion of cellular Ca2+ stores and may thus explain the attenuation of the Ca(2+)-mobilizing effect of AII. This mechanism may result in a decrease of vasopressor-dependent vascular tone in vivo and may contribute to the vasodilatory effect of ramipril.", 
    "117": "1. The two isozymes of human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) have recently been cloned and sequenced. 2. The larger, endothelial isozyme has two highly similar internal domains each bearing a putative catalytic site. In contrast the smaller, testicular isozyme has a single catalytic site corresponding to the C-terminal domain of endothelial ACE and represents the ancestral, non-duplicated form of the gene. 3. Both isozymes are anchored in the plasma membrane by a single hydrophobic transmembrane polypeptide located near the C-terminus, and both are extensively N-glycosylated. 4. The testicular isozyme may also be O-glycosylated. 5. The soluble form of ACE in plasma, seminal fluid and other body fluids appears to be derived from the membrane-bound endothelial isozyme by a post-translational modification. 6. ACE has a complex substrate specificity with peptidyl tripeptidase or endopeptidase action on certain peptides, as well as the classical peptidyl dipeptidase activity. 7. Numerous potent inhibitors of the enzyme have been developed and used successfully in the treatment of hypertension, but some of the observed side effects may be due to inhibition of other zinc metalloenzymes. 8. Both endothelial and testicular ACE are highly conserved between species, indicative of the essential role(s) of the enzyme in blood pressure regulation and other physiological processes.", 
    "118": "Hydrogen peroxide inactivates the purified human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro; the inactivating effect of H2O2 is eliminated by an addition of catalase. The lung and kidney ACE are equally sensitive to the effect of hydrogen peroxide. After addition of oxidants (H2O2 alone or H2O2 + ascorbate or H2O2 + Fe2+ mixtures) to the membranes or homogenates of the lung, the inactivation of membrane-bound ACE is far less pronounced despite the large-scale accumulation of lipid peroxidation products. The marked inactivation of ACE in the membrane fraction (up to 55% of original activity) was observed during ACE incubation with a glucose:glucose oxidase:Fe2+ mixture. Presumably the oxidative potential of H2O2 in tissues in consumed, predominantly, for the oxidation of other components of the membrane (e.g., lipids) rather than for ACE inactivation.", 
    "119": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of captopril combined with oxygen therapy on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with pulmonary hypertension. Eleven subjects, with severe airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC: 42 +/- 11%) and chronic respiratory failure (PaO2: 54 +/- 6 mm Hg, PaCO2: 46 +/- 8 mm Hg) treated with long-term oxygen, underwent two successive hemodynamic and arterial gas studies, at rest and during exercise. All the studies were performed whilst the patients were breathing oxygen, at rest and during exercise and 1 h after intake of 12.5 mg of captopril. The second study was performed in 9 out of the 11 patients after 8 weeks of treatment with 12.5 mg captopril 3 times daily. At rest, there was no significant effect of captopril. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) showed a trend towards decrease after 8 weeks treatment. During exercise, there was a statistically significant decrease of mean PAP, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and total pulmonary vascular resistance, without any deleterious effect on blood gases. However, the clinical significance of these variations during exercise is poor. We conclude that a low dose of captopril associated with oxygen therapy has no significant clinical effect on pulmonary hemodynamics at rest and during exercise in COPD.", 
    "120": "The pharmacological activity and safety of the new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril (RU 44570) has been evaluated in ten healthy male volunteers given 2 mg once daily for seven days. Assessment criteria included evaluation of plasma ACE and renin activity and aldosterone levels in the supine and standing positions, monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram, routine blood and urine laboratory tests, and evaluation of adverse effects. Plasma ACE activity (both in the supine and standing positions) was significantly lower after the first dose and was almost completely suppressed after 7 days of treatment. Plasma renin activity with the subjects in both positions was significantly increased at the end of treatment. Plasma aldosterone did not vary significantly, except for an increase in the standing position after 7 days of wash-out. No significant changes occurred in blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, blood or urine laboratory tests. No adverse effects were reported, in particular, no orthostatic hypotension, cough or episodes of bronchospasm occurred. It is concluded that oral trandolapril 2 mg o.d. is an effective and long-lasting ACE inhibitor with a good safety profile on repeated dosing. Further studies are warranted to investigate its therapeutic application as well as its safety profile after long-term administration.", 
    "121": "The function of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the mammalian eye remains unclear, although alterations in the concentrations of various pathway components can influence intraocular pressure and the electroretinogram. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) has been localized to ocular tissues and fluids. Aqueous humor and serum values of ACE are increased in sarcoid uveitis patients. We used the dog to simultaneously examine the effects of a topically administered ACE inhibitor on the intraocular pressure (IOP), on components of the renin-angiotensin pathway in the serum and aqueous humor, and to monitor any systemic effects of the ACE inhibitor. The novel ACE inhibitor, SCH 33861 (Schering Corporation), decreased IOP in amounts similar to timolol when applied topically to the canine eye. Serum ACE values significantly decreased in SCH 33861 treated dogs, while aqueous ACE values were only slightly decreased. A decrease in heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in these dogs during the treatment period indicated probable systemic absorption. Normal values of aqueous humor and serum angiotensin-I were established for the dog. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin-I values were not significantly changed for any of the treatment groups. Topical application of SCH 33861 to the canine eye is a useful model to further evaluate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the eye.", 
    "122": "Possible circadian changes in the pharmacokinetics and effect on serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity of the ACE inhibitor enalapril have been studied in 8 healthy subjects after oral ingestion of 10 mg enalapril maleate either at 08.00 h or 20.00 h. The time to peak serum concentration (tmax) of enalapril was increased after administration at 20.00 h compared to 08.00 h (2.4 h versus 1.3 h), whereas other kinetic parameters were not significantly altered. The 24 h-kinetics of the active metabolite enalaprilat did not differ significantly between the two treatments, but the area under the curve (AUC (0-24] and the peak serum concentration (Cmax) were slightly higher after intake at 20.00 h. The relationship between the measured serum enalaprilat level and the degree of inhibition of serum ACE was the same after both treatments. Overall, the evening and morning administration of enalapril did not differ markedly in the pharmacokinetics and the time course of ACE inhibition.", 
    "123": "Cocaine abuse can cause cardiovascular damage leading to hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and infarction. This might be partly due to the effects of cocaine on the microcirculation about which little is known, although its effects on the macrovessels are well documented. Accordingly, we used in vivo videomicroscopy to study the vasoconstrictive effect of cocaine on arterioles of different diameter. They were classified into three orders (A2, A3, A4) according to their position in the microvascular network and their diameter. Since calcium antagonists have been reported to exert a protective effect against the cardiovascular disorders induced by cocaine, we tested the hypothesis that this protective action occurs in the microcirculation. We found that intra-arterial administration of the calcium antagonist Nitrendipine greatly inhibited the vasoconstriction induced by cocaine in all three arteriole orders. The degree of inhibition ranged from 44 to 56%. Combined administration of benzodiazepine and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor has also been reported to protect rats against cocaine-induced hypertension and to increase survival rates after a toxic dose of cocaine. Since the mechanisms of this protection are not yet clear, we also studied the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor Enalaprilat on cocaine-induced vasoconstriction. Intra-arterial administration of Enalaprilat inhibited this vasoconstriction slightly but significantly in arteriole orders 2 and 3 by 27 and 24% respectively, but not in order 4. We concluded that Nitrendipine is a powerful inhibitor of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction in the microcirculation. The small but significant inhibition found with Enalaprilat for the larger arterioles suggests that the local angiotensin II level may affect the response to cocaine. However, since the Enalaprilat-induced inhibition was very limited, we conclude that mechanisms other than those occurring in the peripheral microcirculation account for the protection afforded by Enalaprilat against the harmful effects of cocaine.", 
    "124": "The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of fosinopril sodium (SQ 28,555), a new orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was evaluated in 73 healthy men in two separate studies. In study I, doses ranging from 10 to 640 mg were administered once daily for 3 days to seven groups of five subjects each. Serum aldosterone levels, ACE activity, and sitting blood pressure were determined, as were pharmacokinetic parameters of fosinoprilat, the active diacid of fosinopril. In a dose-tolerance study (study II), 80 and 160 mg of the drug were administered in doses of 40 mg bid and 80 mg bid for 2 weeks. Pharmacokinetics were determined on days 1 and 14, and blood pressure and ACE activity were measured daily. One hour after all doses of fosinopril, serum ACE activity was undetectable. Peak blood levels of fosinoprilat occurred at about 3 hours after dosing, and linear kinetics of the diacid were observed. ACE activity remained undetectable for more than 24 hours after the treatment was stopped in study II. Serum aldosterone levels were decreased by 50% of baseline values in both studies. In study I, maximal reductions in mean blood pressure occurred approximately 6 hours postdose; once-daily doses of 20 mg or greater achieved reductions of 11.3 to 21.6% (P less than or equal to .05, compared with placebo reductions). Fosinopril was well tolerated. Subjects reported only mild gastrointestinal complications at doses of 80 mg/day or higher. These data show that fosinopril is a safe and effective inhibitor of ACE with a long duration of action on serum ACE activity.", 
    "125": "The antihypertensive efficacies of lisinopril and captopril were compared using office sphygmomanometry and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. In a double-blind, prospective, randomly allocated trial, the patients were given increasing doses of captopril at 25-100 mg twice a day or lisinopril at 10-40 mg once a day until a clinical response was achieved or the highest dose was reached. A response was defined as a reduction in diastolic pressure below 90 mmHg or a fall of at least 10 mmHg from baseline. The ambulatory monitoring showed that lisinopril reduced blood pressure from baseline to the final value and maintained the reduction to a greater degree than captopril throughout 24-h periods of observation. The office measurements showed a similar trend, but the intertreatment differences did not reach statistical significance. No first-dose side effects were observed with either drug. Once a day lisinopril appeared to be a more effective antihypertensive regimen than twice a day captopril.", 
    "126": "We evaluated effects of inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on growth responses in isolated rat carotid arteries (CA) during continuous exposure to exogenous growth factors in vitro. In freshly isolated CA of adult Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) that had been denuded of endothelium, angiotensin-I (AT-I) and angiotensin-II (AT-II) induced concentration dependent contractions (1 nM to 1 microM). Captopril (100 microM) and lisinopril (10 microM) did not affect responses to AT-II, but increased the ED50 for AT-I 50-fold. To study the effects of ACE inhibition on arterial growth responses in vitro, we measured nuclear incorporation of the thymidine analogue, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd), during organoid culture of isolated CA segments in continuous presence of 20% calf serum. During 4 days of organoid culture 7-10% of the medial smooth muscle nuclei incorporated BrdUrd. During long-term culture (15 days) a new layer of cells developed at the adventitial border of the arterial segments. Continuous presence of captopril (10 microM to 100 microM) or lisinopril (1 microM to 10 microM) did not affect the extent of DNA synthesis in the media or in the newly formed cell layer. Unlike endothelin-1 (ET-1), exogenous AT-II did not stimulate DNA synthesis in isolated renal artery segments. These observations indicate the presence of ACE accessible to exogenous AT-I in arterial compartments other than the endothelium. Interference with this enzyme did not alter growth responses of the isolated arterial wall to serum. Since, in addition, exogenous AT-II did not stimulate intra-arterial DNA synthesis, effects of ACE-inhibitors on arterial growth responses in vivo are most likely due to an indirect effect.", 
    "127": "Alpress LP allows a continuous flow of prazosin, thanks to its new galenic form. This implies a better efficacy and less side-effects in the treatment of hypertension. Besides, prazosin being known for its favourable effect on hypercholesterolemia, Alpress LP was studied in this respect. In each of the three studies detailed thereafter, concerning hypertensive patients, proof was made of the efficacy and the good tolerance of Alpress LP, as compared to reference therapeutics given in hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "128": "The pathophysiological connections between insulin resistance, hypertension and type 2 diabetes are discussed in this review article. Increased blood pressure levels are often found in type 2 diabetic patients long before the diabetes itself is diagnosed. By contrast, in type 1 diabetes hypertension is predominantly the consequence of diabetic glomerulopathy. Non-pharmacological strategies should be favoured in the treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients before specific pharmacological intervention is started. Antihypertensive treatment with beta-blocking agents and diuretics is criticized by many experts in the field of metabolic disorders, since these drugs induce a deterioration of glycaemic control and lipid metabolism in diabetic patients. Since calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and alpha 1-specific blocking agents have no influence on metabolism, these drugs are recommended for the antihypertensive treatment of diabetic patients. Further studies should be undertaken to clarify, whether ACE-inhibitors have a specific nephroprotective effect. Since most type 2 diabetic patients do not develop diabetic nephropathy, a possible nephroprotective effect of ACE inhibitors is only relevant to the antihypertensive treatment of type 1 diabetic patients.", 
    "129": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in most developed countries. Therefore, elucidation of risk factors and associated mechanisms for CAD has been a high priority. Data from the Framingham Heart Study and other large-scale epidemiologic studies have identified major risk factors associated with CAD, demonstrating the adverse effects of increased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the protective effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Other more recent investigations, including the Lipid Research Clinics Trial and the Helsinki Heart Study, have shown that lowering total cholesterol and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly reduce the risk for CAD. Because hypertension is also a significant risk factor for CAD, the assumption has been that blood pressure reduction should offer significant benefits in terms of CAD risk. However, despite their antihypertensive efficacy, diuretics and beta blockers have failed to significantly reduce CAD morbidity or mortality. The adverse effects of these antihypertensive agents on lipid profiles, glucose metabolism and other metabolic parameters may account for their disappointing performance in reducing CAD morbidity and mortality. As a result, newer agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists that appear to be free of such adverse effects have garnered considerable attention for their potential to reduce CAD risk.",

Firstly, we find that, unlike intracerebroventricular angiotensin II, intravenous administration of the hormone at dipsogenic doses does not arouse sodium intake in the sodium replete rat when given alone or in combination with systemic mineralocorticoid pretreatment. Secondly, in the sodium depleted rat, we find that interference with central, but not peripheral, angiotensin II action suppresses sodium appetite.

    "140": "The pharmacokinetics of quinapril, a novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and its active metabolite, quinaprilat, were determined following a single 20-mg oral dose of quinapril in six patients with chronic renal failure maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Overall, quinapril was well tolerated by these CAPD patients, with mild and transient side effects, not unexpected in this clinical setting, which included pruritus, headache, nausea, and cough. Blood pressure reduction was observed in four of six patients, with onset reliably two to four hours after dosing and duration up to 48 hours, associated with quinaprilat concentrations in plasma above 90 ng/mL for at least 33 hours postdose. Two patients experienced significant hypotension, systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, which responded promptly to oral fluid administration and/or reduction in dialysate tonicity. The pharmacokinetic profile of quinapril in these CAPD patients was not significantly different from that previously observed in healthy subjects with normal renal function and in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction not yet requiring dialysis (RDND). The apparent elimination half-life of quinapril was approximately one hour, with negligible dialysate excretion. The pharmacokinetic profile of quinaprilat in these CAPD patients was similar to that previously observed in patients with RDND. The elimination half-life of quinaprilat was markedly prolonged when compared to that in healthy subjects and averaged 20 hours, with only a small amount of quinaprilat excreted in dialysate (mean = 2.6% of total dose).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "141": "Benazepril hydrochloride (CGS 14824A) is an orally active, nonsulfhydryl compound that is transformed in vivo to a long-acting inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Previous studies have shown benazepril to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients and to confer acute hemodynamic benefits in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). In the current multicenter investigation, 16 patients with chronic CHF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 0.40 at rest) whose symptoms corresponded to New York Heart Association classes II to IV were given open-label benazepril once daily in ascending doses of 2 to 20 mg and followed biweekly for 12 weeks. Evaluation of the 15 subjects who completed the trial showed a progressive increase in treadmill exercise duration (from 7.65 +/- 3.64 [SD] minutes at baseline to 9.74 +/- 3.66 minutes at 12 weeks, P less than .001); augmentation of the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (from 0.266 +/- 0.133 at baseline to 0.292 +/- 0.136 at 12 weeks, P less than .025); relief of exertional dyspnea in 7 of the 15 patients (P less than .02); and improvement in global symptomatic status in 10 of the patients (P less than .01). These responses were accompanied by a reduction in serum ACE activity of 75% (from 27.2 +/- 10.5 IU/L at baseline to 6.7 +/- 1.9 IU/L at 12 weeks, P less than .001), which was independent of dose and duration of treatment. The magnitude of ACE inhibition did not correlate with changes in the efficacy variables. Aside from two instances of symptomatic hypotension (one of which was complicated by volume depletion), the drug was well tolerated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "142": "The influence of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of the new ACE inhibitor, benazepril hydrochloride, was evaluated in 12 male patients suffering from liver cirrhosis. The patients received a single oral 20 mg dose. The plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of unchanged benazepril and its active metabolite benazeprilat were determined. Compared with a historical control group of healthy volunteers treated with the same benazepril. HC1 dose, the plasma concentrations of benazepril were doubled in the cirrhotic patients. However, the time to reach maximum concentration (0.5 h) was not affected. The plasma kinetics and the urinary excretion of the metabolite benazeprilat were not significantly altered: Area under the curve and maximum concentration as well as time to maximum concentration (1.5 h) were comparable with those in the healthy subjects. There was also no significant difference between the two populations for the total urinary excretion and the renal clearance of benazeprilat. Both benazepril and benazeprilat were highly bound to serum proteins (96 and 94 per cent, respectively). In conclusion, the rate and the amount of bioactivation of the inactive prodrug benazepril to the active benazeprilat were virtually unaffected by hepatic cirrhosis. Thus, there seems to be no need for dosage adjustment of benazepril hydrochloride in patients suffering from cirrhosis of the liver.", 
    "143": "To evaluate purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure concentrations of serum hypoxanthine, lactate, and noradrenaline were measured before and after submaximal treadmill exercise in 12 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and nine healthy volunteers. In four patients the concentration of hypoxanthine was significantly higher than in the controls or in the remaining eight patients with congestive heart failure. Venous lactate and noradrenaline in the four patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine were also significantly higher than those in the eight patients with normal concentrations of hypoxanthine. Patients who responded normally were also more likely to have been treated with vasodilators and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Exercise induced arrhythmias were more common in the patients with high concentrations of hypoxanthine. These results suggest that the excess purine degradation in patients with congestive heart failure might be the result of a \"relative\" disturbance in the supply of adenosine triphosphate caused by the shift of cellular metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to anaerobic glycolysis during submaximal exercise and that hypoxanthine (a substrate for xanthine oxidase and a source of free radicals) was increased after submaximal exercise in some patients with congestive heart failure.",

Nonimmunologic mechanisms may contribute to progressive renal injury in renal failure of diverse etiologies. Based on the potential adverse renal effects of these processes, a number of dietary and pharmacologic interventions have been proposed as being potentially beneficial in slowing the rate of progression of chronic renal failure to end-stage renal disease. This article reviews current evidence in animal models and humans supporting the efficacy of each of the proposed interventions.",

The estimated cost to supply renal replacement therapy for this population now exceeds $750 million. The relatively recent realization that half of these individuals suffer from noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has sparked increased interest in attempts to understand the pathologic processes involved and how they may be similar or different from those alterations seen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Basic and clinical investigation continues in an attempt to solve the puzzle of pathogenesis, as well as answer questions about the clinical usefulness of microalbuminuria and the appropriate management of hypertension in this population.", 
    "146": "Benazepril HCl is an orally effective angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor previously shown to have significant acute hemodynamic benefits in patients with congestive heart failure. In this study, 21 patients with New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure were treated with 2 to 15 mg of benazepril HCl as a single daily oral dose for 28 days to determine the clinical and hemodynamic value of chronic therapy. Each patient underwent clinical evaluation during the 28-day period, as well as invasive hemodynamic studies on the first two and last two days of the trial. Plasma ACE activity and aldosterone levels fell significantly and renin levels rose after therapy. Benazepril HCl produced significant (p less than 0.01) reductions in arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance, with corresponding increases in cardiac output and decreases in pulmonary artery wedge pressure. Responses after 28 days of therapy were equivalent to those after the initial doses. Clinical effects included reduced rest, exertional and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, as well as reduced peripheral edema. Only one patient developed symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Thus, benazepril HCl, given once daily, is an effective and well tolerated oral agent for the chronic treatment of advanced congestive heart failure.", 
    "147": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril ameliorates radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in rats. The present study determined whether captopril also reduces collagen (hydroxyproline) accumulation in the lungs of rats sacrificed 2 months after a range of single doses (0-30 Gy) of 60Co gamma rays to the right hemithorax. Captopril was administered in the feed at a regimen of 0, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day continuously after irradiation. Mast cell counts also were obtained from lungs of all animals exposed to 30 Gy. In rats receiving no captopril, there was a radiation dose-dependent increase in right lung hydroxyproline (HP) content and in HP concentration per g wet weight. Captopril produced a drug dose-dependent suppression in this radiation-induced HP accumulation. At a dose of 50 mg/kg/d, captopril reduced the slope of the radiation dose response curve for lung HP content by a factor of 1.7, and completely prevented the increase in HP concentration. At an isoeffect level of 550 micrograms HP per right superior lobe, this dose of captopril exhibited a DRF of 1.7 +/- 0.2. In rats exposed to 30 Gy, moreover, the number of mast cells per mm2 of alveolar cross-sectional surface area decreased from 105 +/- 8 to 100 +/- 7 and 59 +/- 5 in the groups given 0, 25 or 50 mg/kg/d of captopril, respectively, (vs none in sham-irradiated rats). These data are the first to demonstrate that the ACE inhibitor captopril might provide a novel intervention in the pathogenesis of radiation fibrosis.", 
    "148": "We investigated the effect of angiotensin II (ANG II) and enalapril on accumulation of renin messenger RNA (mRNA) and on renal renin distribution (immunohistochemical analysis). Adult Wistar-Kyoto rats received enalapril (0.2 mg/ml) in distilled drinking water for 8 or 12 days. On day 5 of enalapril treatment, an osmotic minipump was implanted in the peritoneum that caused sustained release of ANG II (200 ng.kg-1.min-1) or vehicle (bovine serum albumin) for 3 or 7 days. Control rats received water for 8 or 12 days and osmotic minipump implantation (containing vehicle solution) on the 5th day. Renin mRNA was identified by hybridization with a 32P-labeled full-length complementary DNA and was detected by autoradiography. Enalapril treatment increased renal renin mRNA specific activity (renin mRNA/total RNA). Subsequent infusion of angiotensin II for 3 or 7 days decreased renal renin mRNA specific activity. In addition, renin immunostaining increased along the afferent arteriole after enalapril treatment; however, enalapril-induced spread of renin immunostaining was not inhibited by ANG II. Thus ANG II attenuates the accumulation of renin mRNA stimulated by enalapril treatment without alteration of renal renin distribution. The lack of effect of ANG II on renal renin distribution may be due to the length of turnover time for stored protein. These findings suggest the shortloop negative feedback of ANG II on renin reflects inhibition of renin synthesis by ANG II. Therefore, we propose that ANG II exerts a direct inhibitory effect on renin by regulation of renin gene expression in renal vasculature.", 
    "149": "Chronic aminonucleoside nephrosis is variably associated with tubulointerstitial damage, depending on the route and frequency of drug administration. Recently, different groups have shown this injurious tubulointerstitial process to be reversible, coinciding with the resolution of heavy proteinuria to normal values. The authors have previously shown that a single jugular intravenous administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (PA) to male Munich-Wistar rats produces a triphasic pattern of glomerular injury and proteinuria, which culminates in focal glomerulosclerosis 70 weeks after drug administration. The authors now report the later progression of the tubulointerstitial morphologic abnormalities associated with acute nephrosis (phase I), despite spontaneous resolution of glomerular injury during the intermediate period (phase II) in this model. Although treatment of rats with the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (50 mg/l drinking water) over the 70-week period did not affect the magnitude of proteinuria during the acute nephrotic phase, enalapril prevented the recurrence of proteinuria (phase III), as well as significantly reducing the severity of interstitial fibrosis, extent of tubular dilatation, and number of intratubular casts on semiquantitative scoring at the conclusion of the study. In addition, enalapril-treated rats had less low-molecular-weight protein excretion during the recurrent phase of proteinuria, suggesting a preservation of tubular functional capacity to reabsorb these proteins. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed only the glomerular visceral epithelial cell to be sensitive to PA, in contrast with rat tubular epithelium and other cellular controls. Although the exact pathogenetic mechanism responsible for the development of the tubulointerstitial damage remains unknown, PA in vitro does not adversely affect rat tubular epithelium; there is however a clear correlation between the magnitude of recurrent proteinuria and the severity of tubulointerstitial morphologic abnormalities, as suggested by the beneficial effect of converting enzyme inhibition on both of these untoward processes.", 
    "150": "The chronic effects of captopril on maternal hemodynamics and organ perfusion were investigated in 10 untreated and 10 captopril-treated pregnant spontaneously hypertensive rats by means of the radioactive-labeled microsphere technique. The normal decrease in blood pressure during gestation was prevented by reduction of litter size to two conceptuses on day 7 of gestation. Captopril (approximately 10 mg/kg/day) or drug vehicle (50% ethyl alcohol) was administered intraperitoneally by an osmotic pump from day 7 to 21. At term mean arterial pressure was 23% lower in the captopril-treated group as the result of a 29% decrease in total peripheral resistance without a significant change in cardiac output. The decrease in total peripheral resistance was primarily caused by a decline in splanchnic and skin resistances. Maternal organ and uteroplacental perfusion were not significantly altered. We conclude that administration of captopril during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy in the hypertensive rat effectively lowers maternal blood pressure without adverse effects on organ and uteroplacental perfusion.", 
    "151": "Oligohydramnios and neonatal renal failure is reported in a premature infant whose mother had used enalapril in weeks 32-35 of her pregnancy. The infant recovered adequate renal function after peritoneal dialysis. Review of the literature supports our view that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should not be used in pregnancy; if they are, both mother and fetus should be monitored with extreme care.", 
    "152": "Heart failure results not only in a fall in cardiac output but also in a redistribution of blood flow favoring some regional beds (the brain and the heart) at the expense of others (the kidney and working skeletal muscle). The chronic resting hypoperfusion of striated muscle is further compromised with exercise. Maladaptive vasoconstrictor control mechanisms prevent the redirection of blood flow from nonworking muscle and liver to working muscle. This inappropriate preservation of nonworking organ perfusion further compromises the functional capacity of working muscle and is associated with evidence for metabolic deconditioning with reduced oxygen extraction and impaired oxidative phosphorylation. It is becoming increasingly clear that the clinical response to the inotropic and vasodilator therapy used in heart failure is in part dependent on the differing regional blood flow profiles of the various agents studied. The ability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to redirect blood flow away from nonworking regional beds to exercising muscle, and thereby to reestablish an appropriate physiologic response to changing metabolic needs, may be the overriding reason for their long-term efficacy. Certainly in the future the comprehensive therapy of heart failure will have to take into consideration not only central hemodynamic but also regional blood flow/supply and demand issues.", 
    "153": "Our study examines the long-term cardiovascular effects after a brief period of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR were treated with perindopril (3 mg/kg/day) by gavage from 2 to 6, from 6 to 10, or from 2 to 10 weeks of age. Systolic blood pressure was measured in the tail weekly until 25 weeks of age. Corresponding control groups received distilled water for the same periods. In each treatment group blood pressure was reduced significantly during treatment, rose when treatment stopped, but plateaued significantly below control SHR thereafter. This difference in blood pressure at 25 weeks of age was due to reduced total peripheral resistance as determined by microsphere methods, but plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentrations were not different. Cardiac hypertrophy was also reduced in treated SHR. In a separate experiment, perindopril treatment from 6 to 10 weeks of age resulted in a significant reduction in the media/lumen ratios of mesenteric resistance vessels at 32 weeks of age. Concomitant administration of angiotensin II with perindopril from 6 to 10 weeks of age not only prevented the long-term effects on blood pressure seen with perindopril treatment alone but was associated with cardiovascular hypertrophy in excess of untreated control SHR. Finally, perindopril given for a shorter period (6 to 7 weeks) or later in life (20 to 24 weeks) had no significant long-term effects on blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a 4-week period of ACE inhibitor treatment in young SHR is sufficient to prevent the full expression of genetic hypertension and cardiovascular hypertrophy and that angiotensin II might be important in the development of hypertension in this model, its role in later life being less important.", 
    "154": "We compared the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and a conventional antihypertensive regimen (hydralazine and metoprolol) on kidney function, albuminuria, and glomerular ultrastructure in hypertensive diabetic and nondiabetic rats. Diabetes was induced with streptozocin at 8 wk of age in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Antihypertensive drugs were administered in drinking water from the time of induction of diabetes in all groups. Blood pressure reduction was equal in the diabetic and nondiabetic SHR rats receiving either enalapril or hydralazine plus metoprolol. In diabetic SHR rats, there was a rise in serum creatinine after 32 wk, which did not occur in diabetic rats treated with either antihypertensive regimen or in nondiabetic rats. Both drug regimens reduced albuminuria in diabetic and nondiabetic SHR rats to a similar degree. Enalapril and the combination of hydralazine and metoprolol were associated with decreased glomerular basement membrane thickness and glomerular volume in diabetic and nondiabetic SHR rats without significant effect on fractional mesangial volume. Thus, antihypertensive therapy retards the development of albuminuria, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and glomerular hypertrophy in the rat in the presence or absence of diabetes. No specific benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was observed in these hypertensive models of nephropathy. Human studies comparing the effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on kidney function, proteinuria, and glomerular morphology are warranted.", 
    "155": "A physiologically based kidney model was developed to describe the metabolism of enalapril and explain the observed discrepancies between generated and preformed enalaprilat (metabolite) elimination in the constant flow single-pass and recirculating isolated perfused rat kidney preparations (IPKs) as a result of the differing points of origin of the metabolite within the kidney, subsequent to the simultaneous delivery of 14C-enalapril and 3H-enalaprilat. The model incorporated clearances for diffusion/transport of drug and metabolite across the basolateral and luminal membranes of the renal cells, an intrinsic clearance for renal drug metabolism, in addition to physiological variables such as perfusate flow rate, glomerular filtration rate, and urine flow rate. Nonlinear curve fitting of single-pass and recirculating data was performed to estimate the rate-limiting step in the renal elimination of enalaprilat. Through fitting and simulation procedures, we were able to predict metabolic and excretory events for enalapril (renal extraction ratio approximately equal to 0.25-0.3; fractional excretion, FE, was less than unity) and the relatively constant pattern of urinary excretion of preformed enalaprilat (extraction ratio approximately equal to 0.07; FE approximately equal to 1). The extraction ratio of the intrarenally formed enalaprilat in single-pass IPK was about twofold that for the preformed metabolite, whereas the FEs of generated enalaprilat in recirculating IPKs were greater than 1, and tended to increase, then decrease with perfusion time. These observations were explained by the optimized parameters which indicated that efflux from cell to lumen was rate-controlling in the excretion of enalaprilat, and another small transport barrier also existed at the basolateral membrane; the lower extraction ratio of preformed enalaprilat was due to its poor transmembrane clearance at the basolateral membrane. The variable FEs for generated enalaprilat vs. the relatively constant FE for preformed metabolite in the recirculating IPK was explained by the changing contributions of both circulating and intrarenal metabolite to metabolite excretion.", 
    "156": "This multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study compared the antihypertensive effects of two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lisinopril and captopril, in 70 patients (35 lisinopril, 35 captopril) with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg once-daily lisinopril or 25, 50, and 100 mg bid captopril were increased at biweekly intervals until patients responded to treatment, as defined by a decrease in office diastolic pressure to less than 90 mm Hg or at least a 10 mm Hg decrease from baseline. Patients who responded to a 2-week titration dose remained at that dose for another 2 weeks. Blood pressure assessments were made using both office and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Area under the curve analysis of ambulatory blood pressure reductions showed significant differences between treatment groups for both systolic (P = .023) and diastolic (P = .007) blood pressures, with lisinopril-treated patients showing the most significant reduction in pressure. Greater reductions (P less than .05) were also noted in patients receiving lisinopril at hours 10 to 12, suggesting two blood pressure troughs for those receiving captopril. Both drugs were well tolerated, and no patients withdrew from either treatment group. The authors concluded that after at least 4 weeks of therapy, once-daily lisinopril administration was more effective than twice-daily captopril administration in reducing blood pressure, when measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.", 
    "157": "The kinetics of the steady-state inhibition of angiotension I-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C with enalaprilat and ramiprilat can be simulated, assuming only one inhibitor-binding site, consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry if the protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. In this temperature range the apparent inhibition constants for ramiprilat and enalaprilat were roughly doubled by a decrease in the chloride concentration from 0.300 M to 0.120 M.", 
    "158": "The effect of captopril on coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis was investigated. Thirty-two, 3-week-old mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 on day 0 of the study, then randomized into a placebo group or a captopril group starting on day 3 of infection. On day 9 of infection, the mice were put to death. Hearts were weighed and processed for light microscopic examination. Heart weight was 125 +/- 19 mg in the control group versus 102 +/- 14 mg in the captopril group (p less than 0.0003). Amount of necrosis as a percentage of left ventricular section was 3.5% (2.0% to 7.5%) in the placebo group versus 2.0% (0.0% to 5.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The amount of dystrophic calcification was 5.0% (0.0% to 27.5%) in the placebo group versus 1.3% (0.0% to 20.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The extent of the histopathologic involvement by planimetry was 10.2% in the placebo group versus 5.4% in the captopril group (p = 0.052). We conclude that captopril is beneficial in decreasing left ventricular mass and the amount of myocardial necrosis and calcification in the short term in the murine myocarditis model.", 
    "159": "The rat zona glomerulosa has a renin-angiotensin system that appears to function as an autocrine or paracrine system in the regulation of aldosterone production. To further investigate dynamic changes of production of renin and aldosterone in vitro we developed a primary monolayer culture of rat adrenal glomerulosa cells in serum-free medium. Collagenase-dispersed glomerulosa cells were incubated in PFMR-4 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 48 hours; the medium was then replaced with serum-free PFMR-4 medium. The cell viability and the aldosterone secretion were stable over the additional 48 hours in the serum-free control medium. After incubation for 24 hours in the serum-free medium, the cells were exposed to high K+ or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for another 24 hours. ACTH stimulated aldosterone secretion, and this increased secretion was associated with an increase in renin activity (cell active renin, from 15.56 +/- 0.71 to 45.75 +/- 5.69; cell inactive renin, from 0.67 +/- 0.54 to 8.75 +/- 3.40; medium inactive renin, from 5.58 +/- 1.16 to 106.20 +/- 14.01 pg angiotensin I (Ang I)/micrograms protein/3 hr). Aldosterone was also stimulated by high K+. This increase was also associated with an increase in active renin in the cells (from 15.08 +/- 1.80 to 23.26 +/- 2.15 pg Ang I/micrograms protein/3 hr) and an increase in inactive renin in the medium (from 10.87 +/- 1.62 to 21.37 +/- 3.20 pg Ang I/micrograms protein/3 hr).

    "160": "A case of fulminant hepatitis in a patient taking lisinopril for 5 weeks for arterial hypertension is reported. Jaundice, fever, myalgia, and marked increase in serum aminotransferase activities occurred after 2 weeks of treatment. Continuation of lisinopril administration for 3 weeks after the onset of jaundice was associated with the development of grade III encephalopathy and a marked decrease in prothrombin and proaccelerin levels. This case strongly suggests that lisinopril may induce acute hepatitis and that continuation of the treatment after the onset of jaundice can lead to life-threatening hepatic failure.", 
    "161": "We evaluated the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition upon the urinary excretion of albumin in 36 insulin dependent normotensive diabetic patients with adequate metabolic control and no evidence of renal failure. 19 subjects had normal levels of albumin excretion (< 30 mg/24 h) and 17 showed microalbuminuria from 30 to 300 mg/24 h. Half of the patients were randomly selected in each group to receive enalapril, 5 mg/day. A progressive decrease in albumin excretion levels was observed for both enalapril treated subgroups, from 18.9 +/- 8.3 to 8.1 +/- 2.7 mg/24 h (normoalbuminurics) and from 73.1 +/- 25.0 to 40.1 +/- 26.3 mg/24 h (microalbuminurics). In contrast, an increase in albumin excretion from 19.4 +/- 6.8 to 29.4 +/- 14.2 mg/24 h was observed in non treated normoalbuminuric patients. Untreated patients with microalbuminuria remained with stable albumin excretion levels (67.4 +/- 39 to 64.8 +/- 23.4 mg/24 h). Enalapril treatment was associated to a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in creatinine clearance which remained within normal limits. Blood pressure, Na and K plasma levels and total proteins remained normal throughout the study. Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reduces the urinary excretion of albumin in insulin dependent diabetics with normo or microalbuminuria.", 
    "162": "To investigate the changes of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) during antihypertensive therapy, 100 hypertensive patients, mean age 46 years, were studied in pretreatment condition and during 12 months of antihypertensive therapy. In pretreatment condition, 83 patients showed LVH by echocardiography (echo; left ventricular mass index greater than 130 g/m2) and 30 patients had LVH by electrocardiography (ECG) (Sokolow index greater than 35 mm). In comparison to echo index of LVH, Sokolow index showed a sensibility of 34% and a specificity of 88%. Both LV mass echo index and ECG index significantly decreased after 3 months but in different way. LV mass index mainly decreased after 12 months, whereas Sokolow index particularly decreased after 6 months, with no further changes in the subsequent months. After 12 months of therapy, the LV mass echo index normalized in 19% of the patients (16/83) and Sokolow index normalized in 57% (17/30). ECG sensibility and specificity, in comparison to LV mass echo, was 20% and 100%, respectively. Thus, ECG appears less sensitive than echo in the detection of LVH. During antihypertensive therapy ECG index of LVH normalized more precociously and to a greater extent than the echo index. However, the normalization of LVH by ECG does not necessarily mean that a complete anatomic regression of LVH has occurred.", 
    "163": "The left coronary artery in rats was ligated for a period of 15 days to induce hypertrophy of the non-infarcted myocardium. Left ventricular performances were evaluated in the working heart model. In addition, cardiac hypertrophic indices and noradrenaline content were measured. Variables were determined in the absence or presence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril. A 35 and 60% decrease in the coronary and cardiac output, respectively, and a 57% decrease in the noradrenaline content of the non-infarcted left ventricular free wall were seen. Furthermore, a 15% increase in the heart/body weight ratio was observed in the infarcted group. After chronic treatment of the animals with perindopril (2 mg.kg-1 body weight, per os), coronary and cardiac output were impaired to a lesser extent: 8 and 35% respectively, with only a 15% decrease in the noradrenaline content of the non-infarcted left ventricular free wall. Furthermore, the increase in heart/body weight ratio was significantly less than in the nontreated infarct group (7%). We conclude that the beneficial effects of converting enzyme inhibition, during the development of myocardial infarction, on left ventricular performances are associated with a decrease in the hypertrophic indices and a normalization of sympathetic activity.", 
    "164": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is an adaptation of the cardiac fibre to the imposed mechanical overload. This adaptation is quantitative; increased numbers of contractile units with decreased wall stress. Qualitative changes in genomic expression allow the hypertrophied cardiac fibre to develop a normal active tension at the expense of its maximal shortening velocity. These changes are preceded by the temporary expression of proto-oncogenes, of genes of the proteins of thermal shock and by reorganisation of the cytoskeleton, all possible candidates of the regulation of the gene expression in cardiac hypertrophy. In the long-term, the hypertrophy becomes harmful: inadequate subendocardial vascular development; the lowering of the Vmax is beneficial at cellular level but eventually affects cardiac output; ventricular compliance decreases with the development of fibrosis; changes in calcium metabolism are arrhythmogenic. Modifying, prolonging and improving the natural process of adaptation is clearly the first therapeutic objective in order to decrease the hypertension and cause the hypertrophy to regress. Propranolol acts by reducing the cardiac work load. However, betablockers have the disadvantage of increasing the relative density of the subendocardial collagen. Rilmenidine decreases the quantity and density of the collagen. Vasodilators and diuretics induce regression of the myocytic hypertrophy by lowering the threshold of adaptation of these cells, but they have no effect on collagen synthesis. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors which have been shown to be beneficial in controlling hypertension, induce a decrease in the hypertrophy of the myocytes and reduce fibrosis.", 
    "165": "Changes in blood pressure and heart rate after exercise, left ventricular wall thickness, ejection fraction and left ventricular mass were examined by echocardiography before and at the 8th week administration of captopril (37.5-75.0 mg/day) in 11 patients with essential hypertension. The blood pressure showed a gradual and significant decrease from the second week of captopril administration, but the heart rate remained unchanged. No changes were observed in the blood pressure or heart rate after exercise, nor before, during and after the administration of captopril. In the echocardiographic examinations, the wall thickness decreased significantly from 12.1 +/- 2.1 mm before administration to 10.6 +/- 1.5 mm at the 8th week of administration in the interventricular septum, from 11.2 +/- 1.8 mm to 10.1 +/- 1.5 mm in the left ventricular posterior wall, and the left ventricular mass in parallel decreased from 266 g to 218 g. In 7 patients, whose wall thickness was 12 mm or more, the thickness of the septum decreased significantly from 13.9 +/- 1.2 mm to 11.7 +/- 2.1 mm and that of the left ventricular posterior wall from 12.6 +/- 1.5 mm to 10.6 +/- 1.8 mm. Captopril administration produced regression of cardiac hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension within a period of only 8 weeks.", 
    "166": "To assess the value of improved monitoring of medication-taking behavior in a drug trial, we employed a modified pill vial with microcircuitry to record the precise times when the vials were opened. After a 3-week placebo washout period, 21 ambulatory subjects with mild hypertension (mean age, 57 years; 67% men; 76% white) randomly received isradipine or enalapril twice daily in a double-blind titration during 10 weeks. Both drugs achieved a 13% reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.01) with minimal symptomatic or laboratory toxicity. Although pill counts indicated near-perfect compliance (92% to 99% for both groups), the electronic monitor showed that fewer than half of all openings occurred at the prescribed interval of 12 +/- 2 hours. Modest overdispensing was documented in the 3 days before scheduled visits. The monitor confirmed that pill count misclassified compliance sufficiency in 22% of visits and permitted more discrete attribution for drug-associated adverse reactions and secondary resistance to treatment. We conclude that the electronic monitor reduces ambiguity about medication compliance and helps interpret both the biology and pharmacology of the trial.", 
    "167": "Several experimental models involving the development of cardiac hypertrophy in adult rats are characterized by the reexpression of the fetal isoform of myosin heavy chain (V3). To determine whether a similar adult-to-fetal shift in the expression of the thin-filament proteins occurs during cardiac hypertrophy, we have examined the expression of the isoforms of myosin, tropomyosin, and troponin T in the left ventricle of young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with and without treatment using enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Phosphorylation of tropomyosin, which is predominant in the fetal state, was also analyzed. Twelve-week-old SHR were treated with enalapril for 2, 5, 8, and 9 weeks followed by withdrawal of treatment for 9 weeks. Control SHR, without drug treatment, were weight- and age-matched. After 9 weeks of enalapril treatment, mean arterial blood pressure was reduced (from 166 +/- 11 to 89 +/- 5 mm Hg), and left ventricular weight/body weight ratio was regressed (from 2.53 +/- 0.14 to 1.96 +/- 0.05 g/kg) to normotensive levels. During the 9-week treatment period, the percent V3 decreased in SHR substantially from 35 +/- 3% to 13 +/- 1%. There was a significant correlation between the left ventricular hypertrophy and the percent V3 myosin expression in the SHR during regression (r = 0.697, p less than 0.001). However, only the adult isoforms of tropomyosin and troponin T were detected in the SHR with or without enalapril treatment, and the level of tropomyosin phosphorylation remained constant irrespective of the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "168": "The myocardium contains collagen matrix that is a major determinant of its architecture, structural integrity, and mechanical properties. This fibrillar matrix consists primarily of type I and type III collagens having epimysial, perimysial, and endomysial components. The present study shows the alteration of collagen phenotypes during the evolution of hypertensive hypertrophy. Therapy with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that regresses cardiac hypertrophy, not only reduces the total amount of collagen but reverses the altered distribution of type I and type III collagen. In normotensive rats, captopril did not significantly reduce collagen content or alter the ratio of type I to type III collagen.", 
    "169": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced renal failure is now a well-recognized phenomenon that appears to occur almost exclusively in patients with a preexisting reduction in renal perfusion pressure, especially those with renovascular disease. In the latter group of patients, renal failure probably results from some combination of reduced poststenotic renal perfusion pressure and a unique disturbance in the autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate. Although traditionally regarded as functional and reversible, recent animal studies suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced reductions of glomerular filtration rate may lead to progressive renal atrophy, an observation that raises concerns about the long-term safety of these agents in patients with renovascular disease. On the other hand, the deleterious consequences of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in renovascular disease have been exploited as aids in the diagnosis of this disorder. Whether the adjunctive use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will prove to be useful in screening large populations of hypertensive patients for renovascular hypertension remains to be determined. However, such adjunctive tests appear to be useful in judging the functional significance of angiographically documented renal artery stenosis.", 
    "170": "The aim of this study was to compare the clinical effects of calcium-entry blocker Nifedipine and ACE-inhibitor Enalapril in hypertensive patients with glucose intolerance that have lower plasma renin activity. A blood sample for basal PRA was obtained from 21 subjects; then, 11 patients received Nifedipine (20 mg. b.i.d.) and 10 Enalapril (20 mg. q.d.). The extent of blood pressure fall after 12 weeks of treatment was inversely related to basal PRA levels in Nifedipine treated group only; however, the hypotensive effect of both drugs was comparable.", 
    "171": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were excised from the molecule of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) preparation of baker's yeast by heating at 120 degrees C in 1 M AcOH-20 mM HCl. Three inhibitors were then purified by gel-permeation and reverse-phase chromatographies. One of the yeast ACE inhibitors, YG-3, was GAPDH peptide 79-89 (Pro-Ala-Asn-Leu-Pro-Trp-Gly-Ser-Ser-Asn-Val, IC50:18 microM), and contained the sequence homologous to vertebrate ACE inhibitors (GAPDH peptides 79-86 or 81-88). Other inhibitors, YG-1 (Gly-His-Lys-Ile-Ala-Thr-Phe-Gln-Glu-Arg, IC50: 0.4 microM) and YG-2 (Gly-Lys-Lys-Ile-Ala-Thr-Tyr-Gln-Glu-Arg, IC50: 2 microM), corresponded to amino acid residues 68-77 in two different forms of yeast GAPDH, respectively. Their sequences were quite different from those of the venom peptide family. YG-1 was the most potent ACE inhibitor among yeast and vertebrate GAPDH peptides excised by acid-limited proteolysis. Thus, yeast GAPDH seems to be an excellent source of naturally occurring ACE inhibitors.", 
    "172": "To test the hypothesis that the combination of a calcium antagonist and diuretic is less effective in lowering BP than the combination of ACE inhibitor plus diuretic, we compared two groups of patients. The first was a group of 157 consecutive patients (32% male, 90% black, aged 57 +/- 1 years) in whom the only change in therapy was the addition or deletion of either a calcium antagonist or diuretic. Each patient served as his/her own control, with a follow-up time of 41 +/- 4 days. The BP responses of this group were compared with those of another group of 170 consecutive patients (33% male, 85% black, aged 55 +/- 1 years), who had had the addition or deletion of an ACE inhibitor or diuretic some 32 +/- 2 days previously. As there were no statistically significant differences either between drugs within the classes or between the addition or deletion of a drug, the BP results were pooled. Combination therapy with calcium antagonist + diuretic was associated with a 13.4 +/- 1.7/5.4 +/- 0.9 mmHg drop in supine BP; the ACE inhibitor + diuretic combination lowered supine BP by 12.3 +/- 1.6/8.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg compared with monotherapy (all P less than 0.001 by paired t-test). The effects on standing BP were similar: calcium antagonist + diuretic, 13.2 +/- 1.9/5.6 +/- 0.9 mmHg; and ACE inhibitor + diuretic, 12.3 +/- 1.5/7.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg (all P less than 0.001). There were no significant differences in BP responses between the calcium antagonist + diuretic and ACE inhibitor + diuretic combinations. These data indicate that, regardless of the order of addition or subtraction, the combination of calcium antagonist + diuretic was more effective in lowering BP than either agent used alone, and that the combination of calcium antagonist + diuretic was as effective as the ACE inhibitor + diuretic combination.", 
    "173": "We have studied the long term effects of captopril therapy on proteinuria in ten patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with hypertension and nephropathy. There were 7 males and 3 females, with a mean age of 53.3 +/- 10.6 years. After a run-in period of two weeks, therapy with captopril was started. The following parameters were studied: serum glucose, sodium, potassium, cholesterol and triglycerides, glycosylated haemoglobin, renal function and 24 hour urine protein excretion before and at six month intervals for up to 24 months. Average BP fell significantly from 182.5 +/- 28/95 +/- 7.1 to 146 +/- 16.7/76 +/- 18.1 mmHg although no significant changes were seen in the biochemical parameters studied, except a reduction in 24 hour urine protein excretion from 3.86 +/- 2.85 to 0.88 +/- 1.08 g/24 h after 24 months of treatment (P less than 0.01). No correlation was observed between the reduction in proteinuria and any other parameters studied. Our results confirm the reduction of proteinuria in patients with type II diabetes mellitus and stable diabetic nephropathy treated with captopril. This effect was maintained for a period of 24 months.", 
    "174": "As infection and malnutrition are steadily overcome in the developing world, cardiovascular disease loom large in the profile of morbidity and mortality in these societies. Hypertension, rheumatic heart disease and the cardiomyopathies are already taking their toll and atherosclerosis is certain to pose public health problems soon unless steps are taken now, through attention to known risk factors, to pre-empt or at least minimize its consequences. There are populations in developing countries among whom blood pressure does not appear to rise with age and in whom the prevalence of hypertension is very low. Studies of these communities and of migrant groups indicate that salt has an important effect on blood pressure. In spite of these observations, however, it is well known that black communities tend, on the whole, to show a higher prevalence of hypertension and more severe target-organ damage than white communities. Other distinguishing features are lower cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein fractions and a delayed response to a sodium load in black populations. Economic constraints limit the effective application of stepped-care therapy in the management of moderate to severe hypertension. Beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not so effective in black communities unless combined with diuretics.", 
    "175": "The first compounds used to block the renin-angiotensin system were polypeptide antagonists of angiotensin II, administered parenterally. Subsequently, orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were developed which were generally well tolerated, and were effective in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Today they are well established as therapeutic agents. Nevertheless, the search continues for more specific therapeutic agents such as orally active renin inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists, and accurate biochemical methods must be available to assess their efficacy. All approaches trigger a considerable compensatory rise in renin secretion which tends to counteract the blocking effect of these compounds. Hence all agents, but particularly the renin inhibitors, must have a good bioavailability and a high affinity in order to overcome the effect of the compensatory renin secretory response. As yet, it is too early to predict whether the potentially more specific renin inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists will replace the present widely used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "176": "The hypotensive effects of N-[8-amino-1(S)-carboxyoctyl] -L-alanyl-L-proline (AB-47, CAS 120008-53-9) were examined in normotensive rats and various hypertensive rat models. The hemodynamic effect of AB-47 was also examined in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In 2-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K, 1C-RHR) and SHR, the single administration of AB-47 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) induced potent and long-lasting hypotensive effects. The repeated administration of AB-47 (1 to 10 mg/kg, p.o.) to SHR for 29 days produced a dose-dependently and sustained hypotensive effect of 20 to 70 mmHg. AB-47 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) had a weak hypotensive effect in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats but no effects in normotensive and 1-kidney, 1-clip renal hypertensive rats (1K, 1C-RHR). AB-47 (3 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced blood pressure in intact SHR but not in bilateral nephrectomized SHR. The single intravenous injection of AB-47 (10 to 100 micrograms/kg) dose-dependently lowered systemic blood pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and dp/dtmax without affecting heart rate (HR) and these effects of AB-47 were more potent than those of captopril and enalaprilat. These results suggest that AB-47 is a potent and long-lasting hypotensive agent and may be useful for the therapy of both hypertension and congestive heart failure.",

    "182": "The STR/N inbred mouse is a behavioral mutant that drinks up to four times its body weight in water or normal saline per day when given free access, despite the lack of physiological need. Since angiotensin II (AII) is a powerful elicitor of drinking behavior, we investigated the influence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on the amount of water consumed by the STR/N mouse. Oral administration of captopril, which inhibits formation of AII (active octapeptide) from AI (precursor decapeptide), resulted in a reduction of 46 to 79% in water consumption of 53 polydipsic STR/N mice, and a 20-42% increase in water consumption of 12 of 13 Swiss/Webster (S/W) normodipsic control mice. These results suggest that the polydipsic behavior of the STR/N mutant may involve mediation by AII and/or another molecule which is also suppressed by captopril, such as another peptide, which, for activation, requires cleavage by a peptidase which is inhibited by captopril.", 
    "183": "Measurement of the pre-ejection period (PEP) can give valuable information on myocardial function in rats.

    "184": "It is generally accepted that treatment of systemic hypertension protects the kidney from haemodynamically-mediated injury. However, renal function may deteriorate during traditional antihypertensive therapy. Currently, hypertensive nephrosclerosis accounts for approximately 26% of all end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. Furthermore, in spite of aggressive treatment of hypertension, there is no evidence of a reduction in the incidence of hypertensive nephrosclerosis as a cause of ESRD. A current hypothesis states that renal protection is dependent on control of systemic hypertension (when present), and control of glomerular hypertension (when present). Since angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor of the postglomerular capillary bed, which increases glomerular capillary pressure, it is attractive to hypothesize that drug therapies which can interrupt the intrarenal generation of angiotensin II (ACE inhibitors), or drug therapies which may attenuate the intrarenal actions of angiotensin II (calcium antagonists), may be renal protective. ACE inhibitors do control both systemic and glomerular hypertension. Calcium antagonists do control systemic hypertension; they may control glomerular hypertension. Long-term clinical trials in hypertensive patients, comparing the renal effects of ACE inhibitors with other antihypertensive drug classes (including calcium antagonists), have not been reported. It remains to be determined if the potential differing effects of antihypertensive drug classes on the renal microcirculation do, or do not, translate into differing renal protective advantages to patients at risk for the development and/or progression of renal disease.", 
    "185": "Free radical (FR) scavenging may be a therapeutically useful adjunctive property of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In this study we have shown that SH-containing ACE inhibitors (captopril, epicaptopril, zofenopril) are potent FR scavengers at a concentration of 4 x 10(-5) M whereas non-SH ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat, quinaprilat and perindoprilat) have no FR-scavenging activity at this concentration. Furthermore, the SH-containing agents preferentially scavenged general radicals rather than superoxide radicals, i.e. suggesting that these drugs would be effective in quenching the culprit FR in ischaemia/reperfusion injury.", 
    "186": "To examine the efficacy and usefulness of captopril-enhanced renal vein renin (RVR) measurements in detecting the functional significance of renal artery stenosis found in hypertensives, we compared these values in 22 patients with arteriographically documented renovascular hypertension due to unilateral (URVH: 14 patients) or bilateral renal artery stenosis (BRVH: 8 patients) and 12 patients with high renin essential hypertension (EHT). Before captopril administration, RVR ratio was less than 1.5 in 8 patients (36.4%) with renovascular hypertension and all patients (100%) with EHT. Captopril enhanced the lateralization of renal vein renin in renovascular hypertension; the postcaptopril RVR ratio was greater than 2.0 in 18 patients (81.8%) and greater than 1.5 in all the patients (100%). On the other hand, RVR ratio remained unchanged in most patients with EHT. There was no significant difference in the postcaptopril RVR ratios between URVH and BRVH. However, the postcaptopril RVR ratio was higher in atherosclerosis (10 patients) than in fibromuscular dysplasia (11 patients) (P less than .05). Captopril also elucidated contralateral renin suppression as expressed by a contralateral/peripheral renin ratio of less than 1.0, which was associated with a favorable outcome of unilateral surgical intervention. Captopril-stimulated RVR indices were valuable in detecting the functionally significant renal artery stenosis and predicting surgical curability in renovascular hypertension.", 
    "187": "Available information indicates that about 78 new molecules belonging to the class of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are under investigation, and that at least 11 or 12 of the newer ACE inhibitors will be available for clinical use. The newer ACE inhibitors can be classified, according to the zinc ion ligand of ACE, into 3 main chemical classes: sulfhydryl-, carboxyl- and phosphoryl-containing ACE inhibitors. All the newer sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitors differ from captopril since they are prodrugs, and among them alacepril and probably moveltipril (altiopril, MC 838) are converted in vivo to captopril. When compared with captopril, they show a slower onset and a longer duration of action, and obviously the same route of elimination. Zofenopril, a prodrug that is converted in vivo to the active diacid, shows a greater potency, a similar peak time and a longer duration of action than captopril and, unlike captopril, partial elimination through the liver. The newer carboxyl-containing ACE inhibitors are prodrugs which are converted in vivo to active diacids. Like enalaprilat, they are excreted via the kidney; the exception is spirapril, which is totally eliminated by the liver. Compared to enalapril, benazepril shows an earlier peak time and a slightly shorter terminal half-life, cilazapril and ramipril have an earlier peak time and even longer terminal half-life, perindopril shows similar peak time and terminal half-life, while delapril, quinapril and spirapril show an earlier peak time and a shorter half-life. The phosphoryl-containing ACE inhibitors belong to a new chemical class. Fosinopril is a prodrug which is converted to the active diacid in vivo, shows a relatively late peak time, a long terminal half-life, and is eliminated partially by the liver. SQ 29852, the only newly developed ACE inhibitor which is not a prodrug, seems to be more effective than captopril, with a much longer lasting effect and elimination through the kidney. When the differences in potency between these drugs are compensated by dosage adjustment, all the newer ACE inhibitors are expected to exert a similar amount of inhibition of circulating ACE, and therefore to inhibit to a similar extent the generation of circulating angiotensin II and the breakdown of bradykinin. Obviously they may differ in timing and the duration of circulating ACE inhibition according to their pharmacokinetic properties. With regard to the possibility that they may stimulate prostaglandin synthesis, it is suggested that this action, which does not seem to be specific to this drug class, plays only a minor role in their antihypertensive action; the hypothesis that the sulfhydryl group exerts an additional stimulating action remains to be proved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "188": "The association between antihypertensive medications and depression has been recognised for over 40 years. More recently, our understanding of the role of neurotransmitters in the aetiology of depression has helped us understand how antihypertensive drugs cause depression. Biogenic amine depletion is now believed to underlie the organic nature of depression, and many of the drugs used to treat hypertension interfere with this system. There is now compelling evidence that both reserpine and alpha-methyldopa can induce or worsen depression through their actions on the central nervous system. beta-Blockers have also been implicated, but the data supporting the link between these drugs and depression are not as certain. Guanethidine, clonidine, hydralazine, and prazosin appear to pose little risk in causing depression, although rare occurrences have been reported. Diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to have the lowest association with depression and are therefore the drugs of choice when depression is a risk. Physicians should know which drugs introduce the risk of causing or worsening depression. The wide array of medications now available to treat hypertension offers alternatives that pose low risk. All patients receiving medication to treat hypertension should be evaluated periodically for depression, and if depression occurs, medication should be suspected as playing a role in its aetiology.", 
    "189": "The pathophysiology of hypertension in the black population differs to some extent from that of the nonblack population. Although black hypertensives exhibit enhanced sodium retention, expanded plasma volume, lower plasma renin activity, and a greater increase in blood pressure in response to high levels of Na+ intake compared with nonblack hypertensives, there is considerable heterogeneity in these studies. Alterations in ion transport mechanisms, such as a decrease in Na+K(+)-ATPase activity and Na+K+ cotransport, have been demonstrated in the black hypertensive population. Those features provide the physiologic basis for the differential response to monotherapy with diuretics and, perhaps, with calcium channel blockers, that is observed in black hypertensives, particularly when compared with responses to beta-blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "190": "The frequent concurrence of other cardiovascular risk factors in hypertensive patients, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, suggests that overlapping genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the common metabolic and cardiovascular derangements observed in these populations. Hypertension and hyperglycemia accelerate atherosclerosis in diabetics, and play an important role in associated morbidity and mortality. Several abnormalities in blood pressure regulatory systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system, and sodium/volume control have been described in diabetes mellitus. Sodium retention and cardiovascular hyperreactivity appear to occur early in the course of diabetes mellitus, even at normal blood pressure levels and before onset of renal failure, and could set the stage for the development of hypertension. The relationship between obesity and hypertension is also well-established, and may reflect metabolic and cardiovascular adaptations in obese subjects which predispose to blood pressure elevations. Obese subjects display changes in sympathetic nervous system activity, sodium metabolism, and vascular hemodynamics. Sodium-sensitive blood pressure responses in the obese may be secondary to increased cardiac output or fluid volume, and are directly related to circulating insulin levels. Certain metabolic and vascular characteristics of obesity and diabetes mellitus are found in patients with essential hypertension. It has been suggested that insulin and insulin resistance may be the common link between these risk factors. Improved understanding of metabolic considerations in the treatment of obese and diabetic hypertensives should lead to more careful selection of medications that avoid metabolic complications. Although diuretics and beta-blockers may be useful in some patients, there are several reasons not to recommend their use as initial therapy in obese and diabetic hypertensives. On the other hand, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are highly effective, with minimal effects on metabolic parameters, and are well-suited as first-line therapy in the treatment of obese and diabetic hypertensives.",

The Tmax and T1/2 were found to be extended as compared with those of normal humans and hypertensive patients that had been reported. No significant differences were noted between Group I of mild cases and Group II of serious cases. 3) Following administration of captopril, a rise in angiotensin I and renin activity and a reduction in aldosterone were noted. These were found to be correlated or inversely correlated with the changes in the blood concentration of captopril. Greater changes were noted in Group II than in Group I. All clinical test values in each group tended to return to the control value 6h after the administration.", 
    "192": "Kidney transplant patients may develop post-transplant erythremia (PTE), and in order to avoid thromboembolism venesection, anticoagulation and native kidney removal have been suggested. We propose captopril as an alternative therapy for PTE. Seven hypertensive PTE patients, aged 42 +/- 10 years with stable renal function, were investigated to exclude primary or secondary polycythemia. All patients manifested true erythrocytosis [red blood cells (RBC) mass greater than 20% of predicted level] with concomitant increases in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. Captopril was introduced in gradually increasing doses up to 75 mg/day under careful monitoring of blood pressure and renal function. Weekly follow-up was arranged to evaluate drug efficacy. After captopril, a significant reduction with normalization of the RBC mass (42 +/- 4 vs 31 +/- 5 ml/kg: P less than 0.005) was observed. The RBC counts and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels also decreased. One patient had recurrent erythrocytosis after captopril withdrawal.

Body weight increased comparably in the treatment groups and age-matched controls, reaching on average 197 +/- 11, 214 +/- 12 and 198 +/- 3 g in ACEI-, verapamil- and hydralazine-treated rats, respectively, versus 218 +/- 6 g in control rats. Glomerular hemodynamic patterns, including glomerular capillary pressure, measured in maturing rats after one and six weeks of ACEI treatment were unaffected by ACEI.

Furthermore, the maturational PAmean increase in rats given ACEI for six weeks was, on average, only half of that achieved by age-matched controls not given ACEI, in contrast to normal maturational growth with hydralazine or verapamil (29% increase in PAmean from normal baseline in ACEI vs. 52%, 53% and 59% increases in verapamil, hydralazine and control, respectively). In contrast, comparable PAmean values were found in adults with (7.08 +/- 0.22 x 10(-3)mm2, N = 6) and without (6.98 +/- 0.33 x 10(-3)mm2, N = 6) ACEI treatment given for six weeks.

No convenient substrate for kinetic analysis of the enzyme had been previously described. HPLC analyses indicated that meprin cleaved bradykinin and nitrobradykinin between Phe5 (or Phe5(NO2)) and Ser6. Reaction rates for bradykinin were determined by quantitative HPLC analyses, whereas rates for nitrobradykinin were measured by continuous monitoring of the spectral change that occurs at 310 nm when the Phe(NO2)-Ser bond is hydrolyzed. For nitrobradykinin and unmodified bradykinin, respectively, Km values were 281 and 425 microM, kcat values were 28 and 22 s-1, and kcat/Km values were 9.7 x 10(4) and 5.1 x 10(4)M-1. The two products of bradykinin hydrolysis were not substrates for the enzyme, but they were inhibitors. The initial rates of hydrolysis of nitrobradykinin increased linearly with enzyme concentration (0.09-2.2 micrograms/ml), and increased linearly with temperature in the range from 15 to 55 degrees C. Hydrolysis of the substrate was optimal at alkaline pH values. The cysteine endopeptidases papain and cathepsin L and the metalloproteases thermolysin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) also cleaved nitrobradykinin, but at different peptide bonds than meprin. The single cleavage of nitrobradykinin at the Phe(NO2)-Ser bond and the concomitant spectral shift that occurs at alkaline pH makes this a particularly suitable substrate for meprin.", 
    "197": "The effect of the renin inhibitor ES-1005 or captopril on the expression of the kidney renin gene was investigated in sodium-depleted marmosets. We measured the level of kidney renin messenger RNA (mRNA) after continuous administration of ES-1005 (48 mg/kg per day) or captopril (2 mg/kg per day) intraperitoneally, via an osmotic mini-pump, for one week. The level of kidney renin mRNA was measured by densitometric Northern blot analysis using an alpha-32P-labelled human renin cDNA fragment as the hybridization probe. Captopril treatment markedly increased plasma renin activity and the level of kidney renin mRNA by 4.7-fold and 6.3-fold, respectively. ES-1005 treatment completely inhibited plasma renin activity and significantly decreased the level of kidney renin mRNA (46% of the normal control P less than 0.01). However, plasma immunoreactive renin concentration was significantly increased by the treatment with ES-1005 (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that the treatment with the renin inhibitor ES-1005 for one week has a paradoxical effect on kidney renin gene expression and renin release from the kidney in sodium-depleted marmosets.", 
    "198": "This study investigates the potential utility of a drug concentration-effect modelling approach to predict the long-term response to antihypertensive treatment with enalapril. Concentration-effect relationships were characterized in 13 subjects following a single dose of enalapril (20 mg) and for each individual the derived parameters were used to predict the steady-state blood pressure profile. The predicted responses (before dosing and 4 h after dosing) were in close agreement with the responses observed after 6 weeks. In individual patients, the observed and predicted blood pressure profiles over a 12 h period were compared. In six of the 13 subjects, there were statistically significant (P less than 0.05) prediction errors. However, in all but one of these patients the error was less than 10%, and for the group as a whole the mean prediction error was small and not statistically significant (-0.6 +/- 2.1 mmHg). The kinetic-dynamic parameters derived from observations of the first dose were used to simulate steady-state responses to several alternative doses and dose frequencies. A regimen of 10 mg twice daily increased the ratio of blood pressure at trough-to-peak response to 75 +/- 5% compared to 33 +/- 16% when 20 mg was given once daily. In addition, a twice-daily regimen reduced the coefficient of variation of the hourly average blood pressure. Thus, concentration-effect parameters derived from the first dose response to enalapril have potential not only for predicting long-term antihypertensive response, but also for optimizing dosage regimens for individual patients.", 
    "199": "The effects of peptidase inhibitors were examined upon behavioural responses including scratch, bite and lick produced by intrathecal (IT) injection of substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NK A) in mice. Phosphoramidon (0.002-2.0 nmol), an endopeptidase-24.11 inhibitor, simultaneously injected with SP or NK A, remarkably enhanced and prolonged SP- or NK A-induced behavioural response in a dose-dependent manner. The behavioural response to SP was significantly increased by 2.0 nmol of bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, but not by 1.0 nmol. Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was without effect on both tachykinin-induced responses. When phosphoramidon was injected together with bestatin and captopril which have no significant effect alone, SP- or NK A-induced behavioral response was significantly increased. These data suggest that endopeptidase-24.11 may be an important enzyme responsible for terminating of SP- or NK A-induced behavioral response at the spinal cord level.", 
    "200": "Up to 50% of hypertensive men are subject to sleep apnea (SA). With a prevalence in men of up to 10%, SA is a common illness and hypertension (HT) one of its early symptoms. It is important to have available a drug treatment that will effectively control blood pressure (BP) without exacerbating symptoms of SA. Twelve patients with SA and HT were investigated in a double-blind, comparative trial. Patients were randomly allocated to either metoprolol (M) 100 mg daily or cilazapril (C) 2.5 mg daily. Polysomnographic measurements under standardized conditions including intraarterial BP monitoring were taken on two consecutive nights each before and after the 1-week treatment. Values in the M group were (mean +/- 95% CI) systolic BP 161 +/- 2.1 vs. 148 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01); diastolic BP 98 +/- 1.8 vs. 93 +/- 1.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01); and HR 73 +/- 1.2 vs 65 +/- 1.1 beats/min (p less than 0.01). Corresponding figures for the C group were systolic BP 140 +/- 2.1 vs. 127 +/- 2.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01); diastolic BP 95 +/- 1.7 vs. 78 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01); and HR 82 +/- 1.1 vs. 79 +/- 1.2 beats/min (p less than 0.01). Whereas C reduced both BP and HR in all sleep phases, M produced no changes during REM sleep. SA activity was 45 (range 15-91) vs. 34 (range 2-57) apneas per hour of sleep in the M group and 54 (range 21-84) vs. 40 (range 8-72) apneas per hour in the C group (p less than 0.01). There were no changes in total sleep time or in the proportions of non-REM to REM sleep. Both M and C reduce nocturnal BP in SA patients, but the effect of C is seen in all sleep phases. C has a more favorable effect on the disturbed nocturnal blood pressure of SA patients.", 
    "201": "In 11 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure we studied the short-term effects of the calcium antagonist nitrendipine, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, and the combination of both drugs on blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and proteinuria in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled way. After one week of treatment, blood pressure at 2-5 h after drug administration amounted to 159 +/- 5/101 +/- 3 mm Hg (means +/- SEM) during placebo. Nitrendipine, cilazapril, and the combination lowered mean arterial pressure by 1.4 +/- 1.6 (NS), 6.0 +/- 1.7 (p less than 0.10), and 10.3 +/- 2.1% (p less than 0.01), respectively. Glomerular filtration rate did not change. As compared to placebo, renal blood flow increased and renal vascular resistance decreased significantly during the combination. Filtration fraction amounted to 22.7 +/- 1.2% during placebo and was 22.0 +/- 1.4 (NS), 20.4 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.01), and 20.5 +/- 1.4% (p less than 0.05) during nitrendipine, cilazapril, and the combination, respectively. During nitrendipine, albuminuria was slightly higher than during placebo: 0.86 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.25 mg/min (NS). During cilazapril alone and during the combination of both drugs, albuminuria was lower as compared to nitrendipine: 0.38 +/- 0.14 mg/min (p less than 0.01) and 0.44 +/- 0.18 mg/min (p less than 0.01), respectively. The data suggest that the combination of nitrendipine and cilazapril is an effective treatment in renal hypertension. In addition, cilazapril alone as well as the combination with nitrendipine reduced albuminuria, possibly by decreasing filtration fraction and/or reduction of blood pressure.", 
    "202": "The effects of long-term lisinopril therapy on glucose tolerance and serum lipid profiles were investigated prospectively in 30 hypertensive patients: 15 with normal glucose tolerance and the remaining 15 with glucose intolerance. The levels of plasma glucose, serum lipids, and plasma glycosylated hemoglobin A1c were determined before and during long-term (6 months) therapy with lisinopril. A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was performed before and during long-term lisinopril therapy. Lisinopril produced significant falls in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both patient groups during the long-term therapy. Neither fasting nor post-glucose-load venous plasma glucose levels were altered in either group of patients, and no patients with normal glucose tolerance developed diabetes mellitus during the study. There was no significant change in the insulinogenic index (delta IRI/delta BS at 30 min post-glucose load) in both patient groups. No significant changes in fasting levels of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol were observed in either group during long-term lisinopril therapy. Long-term lisinopril therapy does not compromise glucose or lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients. Lisinopril may have an advantage as an antihypertensive agent that can be given to hypertensive patients without concern that it might alter their serum lipid concentrations or impair glucose tolerance.", 
    "203": "The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of captopril on cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and CO2 reactivity in eight young healthy volunteers. The mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was measured intraarterially, and CBF was measured by inhaled xenon-1233. The CO2 reactivity was defined as the relative change in CBF per 0.1 kPa change in arterial CO2. During the CO2 reactivity tests, the CBF changes were estimated by the arteriovenous-oxygen-difference method (CBFsat). Median CBF was 52 ml/100 g/min (50-56) and without any significant regional side-to-side asymmetries. No significant change was observed after captopril. The median resting MABP was 90 mm Hg (89-93), and was slightly reduced by 5 mm Hg (4-6) 1 h after an oral dose of captopril (50 mg). CMRO2 was 3.7 ml/100 g/min (3.5-3.8) and was unchanged after captopril. For the entire range of PaCO2 the median slope of the ln(CBFsat) versus PaCO2 regression line was 1.4 (1.3-1.6) at baseline compared to 1.4 (1.3-1.7) after captopril (p = 0.23). Considering the PaCO2 values between 4.0 and 6.5, the CO2 reactivity was 2.4%/0.1 kPa (2.1-2.4) at baseline and increased significantly to 2.9%/0.1 kPa (2.1-3.2) after captopril (p less than 0.05). No side effects were observed. The present study shows an overall unchanged CO2 reactivity; however, with an increased CO2 reactivity of the cerebral vessels for small changes in PaCO2 around the resting value of PaCO2 and a maintained coupling of CBF and CMRO2 after peroral captopril.", 
    "204": "In a trial conducted in a physician's office, the adequacy of a single daily dose of the ACE-inhibitor captopril in the management of hypertension was investigated by 24-hour monitoring. Patients of both sexes shown by conventional blood pressure measurements to respond to captopril were included in the study. After a two-week washout period, during which no anti-hypertensive treatment was given, the patients were subjected to 24-hour blood pressure monitoring prior to and following eight weeks of treatment with a daily dose of 50 mg captopril. At the end of the treatment period the mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure decreased from 158 (SD +/- 24) mmHg to 131 (SD +/- 20) mmHg, and the mean 24-hour diastolic blood pressure from 99 (SD +/- 22) mmHg to 84 (SD +/- 14) mmHg. No side effects were observed. These results show that a single daily dose of captopril suffices to reduce blood pressure adequately over 24 hours also under outpatient conditions.", 
    "205": "The metabolism of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was studied in rats infused with 125I-BNP. During the infusion, the intact peptide was progressively converted to labelled degradative products, separated into nine peaks of radioactivity on HPLC, and accounting for approximately 70% of total plasma radioactivity at the plateau phase. After stopping the infusion, intact BNP disappeared with a half-life of 1.23 +/- 0.35 min whereas the labelled fragments accounted for progressively greater proportion of total activity. The degradation of BNP was significantly reduced by phosphoramidon (t1/2, 11.28 +/- 0.49 min) and captopril (t1/2, 6.99 +/- 0.34 min). A maximal effect was observed when both protease inhibitors were given simultaneously (t1/2, 15.3 +/- 0.48 min). When 125I-BNP was incubated in vitro with purified endopeptidase 24.11 (E-24.11) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), there was a time-dependent disappearance of the intact peptide associated with the generation of six labelled fragments, corresponding to fragments found in vivo. In serum the peptide was rapidly degraded with a half-life of 4.6 +/- 0.1 min, and the pattern of labelled fragments was similar to that observed during in vitro incubation with ACE. Captopril significantly reduced the rate of degradation of BNP in serum. The results allow to associate two define enzyme activities, namely E-24.11 and ACE, with the metabolism of BNP in vitro. They also indicate that, despite a close homology between ANP and BNP, the two peptides undergo different pathways of clearance.", 
    "206": "Inactivation of rabbit lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Dnp-F) has been shown to be due primarily to the modification of a tyrosine residue [B\u00fcnning, P., Kleeman, S.G., & Riordan, J.F. (1990) Biochemistry (preceding paper in this issue)]. Rabbit testicular ACE is also inactivated by Dnp-F. The specific site of modification has been identified by peptide mapping of tryptic digests of the Dnp-modified protein. Two principal 340-nm-absorbing peaks, not observed with protein modified in the presence of inhibitor, have been characterized. Amino acid and sequence analyses show that these peptides contain two distinct residues that have been selectively modified. The sequence of the major (greater than 90% of the total) modified peptide is YVEFTNK with the Dnp group on tyrosine. The sequence of the second, minor peptide is KVQDLQR with the Dnp group on lysine. Identical peptides were obtained from Dnp-modified rabbit lung ACE. These modified amino acids correspond to residues 200 and 118, respectively, in testicular ACE (human enzyme numbering). Both peptides are present only in the carboxy-terminal half-domain of lung ACE, corresponding to residues 776 and 694, respectively. These results indicate that the Dnp-F sensitive, catalytically functional active site is located in the \"testicular\" half of lung ACE.", 
    "207": "The peptidase and esterase activities of rabbit pulmonary angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are rapidly abolished on reaction with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Dnp-F). Inactivation follows first-order kinetics with respect to the reagent and is accompanied by stoichiometric incorporation of 3,5-[3H]Dnp, indicating that the effect is due to a specific modification of the enzyme. Thin-layer chromatography of an acid hydrolysate of the modified enzyme indicates that most of the radioactive label is present as O-Dnp-tyrosine (65 to greater than 95%) and the rest as N epsilon-Dnp-lysine. The pH dependence of the reaction is consistent with modification of either tyrosine or lysine. The presence of a competitive inhibitor effectively protects the enzyme against inactivation by Dnp-F. Acetylation of ACE with N-acetylimidazole also protects the enzyme against modification with Dnp-F. The results indicate the presence of catalytically essential tyrosine and lysine residues at the active site of ACE.", 
    "208": "One component of cyclosporin A (CsA) nephrotoxicity is thromboxane (Tx) A2 induced renal vasoconstriction. This study was designed to investigate whether coadministration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and thromboxane synthetase inhibition (TSI) could act synergistically to improve the glomerular filtration rate in CsA treated animals. CsA administration (50 mg/kg/day p.o.) to Sprague-Dawley rats for 14 days caused a significant decline in creatinine clearance (CCR), an increase in N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) enzymuria and renal tubulointerstitial damage. These changes were associated with a ten-fold increase in urinary TxB2 excretion (from pretreatment values of 17.2 +/- 6.0 ng/day to 174.9 +/- 65.4 ng/day on day 14). Treatment with TSI normalized TxB2 excretion; this was associated with partial protection against CsA induced changes in CCR and NAG enzymuria and the complete prevention of acute proximal tubular vacuolation. However, the coadministration of both TSI and ACEI removed the protective effects exerted by TSI alone and resulted in elevated urinary TxB2 levels similar to those observed in other CsA treated groups. Treatment with ACEI alone did not affect CsA nephrotoxicity. We suggest that elevated TxB2 synthesis is in part responsible for some aspects of renal functional and morphological damage, but that CsA nephrotoxicity is multifactorial and may result from direct cellular toxicity in addition to vascular changes.",

    "215": "The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is of poor prognosis in essential arterial hypertension, but it may regress under antihypertensive treatment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, centrally acting antihypertensive agents and beta-blockers with low intrinsic sympathomimetic activity constantly reduce the left ventricular mass. This stands in contrast with diuretics and vasodilators which induce stimulation of the sympathetic and/or renin-angiotensin systems and usually have no effect on LVH. Animal experiments have shown that regression of LHV has no adverse effect on the myocardial changes aimed at correcting the LVH-associated abnormalities (collagen content, changes in isomyosins, density of beta-adrenergic receptors, etc.) and that it improves the coronary haemodynamics disturbed by LVH. In clinical practice, reducing the ventricular mass does not modify the left ventricular systolic function, usually improves the diastolic function precociously altered by LVH and seems to reduce the LVH-induced ventricular hyperexcitability. The regression of LVH under antihypertensive treatment should result in a lesser cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.", 
    "216": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of converting enzyme inhibition on the contractile reactivity of porcine femoral and intramuscular resistance arteries. The arteries were dissected free of hind limb skeletal muscle from anaesthetized pigs (Micro-pig Yucatan, Charles River), and were mounted in organ chambers and in a myograph system for tension recording. Bradykinin induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation in both vessels which was potentiated by S 10211, a converting enzyme inhibitor, only in resistance arteries. Under basal conditions angiotensin II and angiotensin I did not contract resistance arteries although contraction could be obtained with other agents such as KCl, noradrenaline or vasopressin. If the tone was increased with noradrenaline, angiotensin II and angiotensin I produced an increase in tension. S 10211 inhibited the increase in tension induced by angiotensin I but not by angiotensin II in vessels with and without endothelium. These results suggest that (1) converting enzyme is present in the vascular wall of porcine resistance arteries, (2) this enzyme is not necessarily located on the endothelial cells and, (3) converting enzyme could influence the responsiveness to angiotensin I and bradykinin.", 
    "217": "By interrupting the integrity of the systemic and renal renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown, experimentally, to preferentially reduce postglomerular capillary arteriolar resistance, to reduce glomerular capillary pressure, and to increase the ultrafiltration coefficient. Under normal physiological conditions, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have little effect on glomerular filtration rate; however, they increase effective renal plasma flow at renal perfusion pressures within the normal autoregulatory range and renal vascular resistance is decreased. In contrast, calcium antagonists have been shown, experimentally, to preferentially reduce preglomerular capillary arteriolar resistance. Their effects on angiotensin II and postglomerular capillary arteriolar resistance (hence, glomerular capillary pressure and the ultrafiltration coefficient) are controversial. Under normal physiological conditions, calcium antagonists increase both glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow at renal perfusion pressures within the normal autoregulatory range and renal vascular resistance is decreased. In patients with essential hypertension, studies have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (as predicted) sustain glomerular filtration rate, increase effective renal plasma flow, and decrease renal vascular resistance. However, essential hypertensive patients with impaired glomerular filtration rate may demonstrate marked improvement in both glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. Calcium antagonists (as predicted) may increase both glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow (at high renal perfusion pressures) and may decrease renal vascular resistance. Calcium antagonists may also improve both glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow in patients with impaired glomerular filtration rate. Long-term clinical trials comparing the renal effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with those of calcium antagonists in essential hypertensive patients have not been reported. It remains to be determined if the potentially different effects of these two classes of antihypertensive drugs on the renal microcirculation do or do not translate into different renal protective advantages to patients at risk for the development and/or progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis.", 
    "218": "Hyperlipidemia in the nephrotic syndrome is characterized by increased synthesis of lipids as well as reduced removal of lipids from the blood. When rats with nephrotic syndrome are fed a 40% protein diet, urinary albumin excretion and rate of albumin synthesis increase. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentration increase as well. If the increase in albuminuria, but not the increase in the rate of albumin synthesis resulting from dietary protein augmentation, is prevented by the administration of enalapril, serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentration are not increased but are reduced nearly to within the normal range. Proteinuria, and not an increased rate of albumin synthesis, thus plays a causal role in nephrotic hyperlipidemia. Therapy directed at correcting altered glomerular permselectivity, while perserving an increased rate of albumin synthesis, may be effective in managing nephrotic hyperlipidemia.", 
    "219": "Differential solute clearances were used to examine the effects of enalapril on glomerular barrier function in 16 proteinuria patients with diabetic glomerulopathy. In these patients, a 90-day course of enalapril reduced arterial pressure without lowering renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate. Glomerular clearances of dextrans of broad size distribution (28 to 60 A) were lowered significantly. Theoretical analysis of the dextran clearance profiles revealed that enalapril shifted glomerular pore size distribution to a smaller size. This change in barrier size selectivity was associated with a reduction in fractional albumin and immunoglobulin G clearances during enalapril therapy; urinary protein excretion tended to decrease in parallel. These results indicate that converting enzyme inhibition diminishes glomerular permeability to proteins in diabetic nephropathy by enhancing barrier size selectivity. Because enalapril therapy did not alter the renal plasma flow rate or glomerular filtration rate, these results further suggest that the primary action of enalapril may be to modulate the intrinsic membrane properties of the glomerular barrier.", 
    "220": "In diabetes mellitus, studies on the renin angiotensin system conflict. Among type I diabetic patients, we have found normal plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels. In these patients, low-dose angiotensin II infusion resulted in the same effect on renal hemodynamics as that observed in healthy controls. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, a disease usually regarded as a low-renin condition, we have found elevated levels of plasma renin activity as compared with that seen in healthy persons and control subjects with other renal diseases that result in a similar degree of renal failure. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, interruption of the renin angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been associated with a reduction in proteinuria. It is not clear whether this is a result of blood pressure reduction or a specific effect of these drugs. In a randomized trial with patients with diabetic nephropathy, we found that enalapril treatment reduced proteinuria to less than half the level obtained in a metoprolol-treated group during equally effective blood pressure control. In a long-term prospective study of captopril in patients with diabetic nephropathy, the rate of decline in kidney function was reduced to half the value that was calculated during a retrospective period. The renin angiotensin system, therefore, can be normally active in patients with diabetic nephropathy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can reduce proteinuria by mechanisms independent of their effect on blood pressure. Long-term treatment may protect renal function to a greater degree than might be expected from the blood pressure-lowering effect.", 
    "221": "Clinical and experimental diabetic states are often characterized by an increase in the glomerular filtration rate, and early hyperfiltration may be a risk factor for the later development of diabetic glomerulopathy. Evidence in diabetic animal models suggests that, of the determinants of diabetic hyperfiltration, glomerular capillary hypertension plays a key role in the development of structural injury. In diabetic rats, despite normal systemic blood pressure, the glomerular capillary pressure is elevated because of disproportionate vasodilation of the afferent arteriole. In this normotensive model, a modest reduction in systemic blood pressure with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy normalizes glomerular capillary pressure and retards the development of injury. However, animal studies suggest that all antihypertensive regimens may not afford equivalent protection. It has been reported that monotherapy with calcium channel blockers, or hydralazine, is less effective in limiting albuminuria than are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In a study comparing the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with those of reserpine, hydrochlorothiazide, and hydralazine, both regimens lowered blood pressure and offered some long-term protection. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition resulted in significantly greater limitation of injury than did the combination regimen. These results suggest that antihypertensive therapy retards diabetic renal disease; however, some anti-hypertensive regimens may afford superior protection.",

In a two-way crossover study, six healthy male subjects (age range 25-36 years) each received an iv 11.2-mg dose of [14C]SQ 26,703 (14C-3; the L-arginine salt of 2) and an oral 10-mg (equimolar) dose of 14C-1. After the iv dose of 14C-3, the 0-96-h recovery of radioactivity averaged 76 and 16% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively, indicating substantial biliary secretion. After the oral dose of 14C-1, excretion of radioactivity averaged 70% (urine) and 26% (feces). Negligible amounts of 1 were present in urine, indicating complete hydrolysis of the orally administered prodrug. The oral absorption of 1 was almost complete and the oral bioavailability of 2 averaged approximately 70%. The terminal elimination half-life for 2 after the iv dose averaged 5.5 h. Whole body clearance, renal clearance, nonrenal clearance, and Vdss averaged 11.4, 3.1, and 8.3 mL/min/kg and 1.3 L/kg, respectively.

Treatment side effects were reported by 21% of the enalapril-treated patients and 29% of the diltiazem-treated patients; treatment was discontinued in two patients from each group because of side effects. It is concluded that both drugs were generally well tolerated and effective in the treatment of adult mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "225": "Burn injury and intradermal injection of bradykinin or histamine cause permeability changes visualized as dye-release lesions in the skin of guinea pigs injected intravenously with Evans blue dye. Antihistamine pretreatment ablates the histamine but not the effect of thermal injury or bradykinin. Bradykinin is generated via activation of Hageman factor in a two-step reaction. Steps 1 and 2 can be inhibited by corn trypsin inhibitor and soy bean trypsin inhibitors, respectively. Dye-release lesions were reduced from thermal injury and bradykinin injections when these substances were injected into the skin first. Angiotensin-converting enzyme deactivates bradykinin by degrading it. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor neutralizes angiotensin-converting enzyme. Dye-release lesions from both thermal injury and bradykinin injection were enhanced because of continued bradykinin build-up when these treatments were preceded by subcutaneous injections of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Thus bradykinin is generated in thermal injury via the Hageman factor-dependent pathway. Hageman factor sits at the apex of a series of interrelated cascade systems, all of which impinge on the animal's immune status. Uncontrolled Hagemen factor activation in thermal injury may be the link among all the events collectively known as the \"post thermal injury immunosuppression syndrome.\"", 
    "226": "In 33 patients with heart failure (NYHA II-III) 24-h blood pressure was examined during the titration of two ACE-inhibitors. Blood pressure was measured by the oscillometric method using the blood pressure monitor 90202 from SpaceLabs, Inc. The measurements were taken from 06.00 to 22.00 hours every 20 min, and from 22.00 to 06.00 hours every 1 h. All patients received an additional therapy, either with captopril (group 1, n = 17) or enalapril (group 2, n = 16) in random order. Serum-electrolytes, serum-creatinine, and plasma-renin activity were measured before and during therapy with both ACE-inhibitors. 24-h blood pressure measurements were taken before and on the first and fifth day of the treatment with ACE-inhibitors. The groups did not different in respect to the degree of heart failure, the concomitant medication, or the 24-h profiles of blood pressure and heart rate. The mean initial doses of captopril was 9.2 +/- 1.2 mg. Each patient of group 2 received an initial dose of 2.5 mg enalapril. The maximal decrease of diastolic blood pressure occurred after 1 h in group 1 and after 4 h in group 2 and was similar in both groups (8 vs, 7 mmHg). The 24-h blood pressure values on day 5 were consistently below the pretreatment values (p less than 0.005). Heart rate was not affected by either ACE-inhibitor. The groups did not differ significantly during ACE-inhibition in their 24-h blood pressure and heart rate profiles. Before treatment, serum-sodium, -potassium and -creatinine were within the normal range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "227": "Therapeutic considerations regarding the treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus are reviewed. Good blood pressure control is essential in diabetic patients to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension may also accelerate complications of diabetic microvascular disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Diuretics (e.g., thiazides, furosemide, ethacrynic acid, bumetanide) and beta blockers have traditionally been used as initial therapy for most patients with hypertension; however, these agents may not be the best choice for diabetics. Adverse metabolic consequences include alteration of glucose metabolism and plasma lipids. Beta blockers may also blunt the ability of patients to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia. Both diuretics and beta blockers can cause sexual dysfunction in men. Adrenergic agents and vasodilators are associated with a high prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in diabetic patients. The calcium-channel blockers are considered safe and well tolerated when given at low and moderate doses. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are able to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy by reducing the glomerular hypertension that causes it. For the treatment of mild hypertension in diabetic patients, the drugs of choice should include (in descending order) ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, diuretics, and beta blockers. Severe or resistant hypertension usually requires treatment with combinations of drugs, including a diuretic. Tailoring therapy to individual complications and close monitoring of the patient are essential for safe, effective treatment of hypertension in the diabetic patient.", 
    "228": "We report five life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions occurring within the very first minutes of hemodialysis on polyacrylonitrile (AN69) capillary dialyzers in three patients receiving ACE inhibitors. Such reactions were not observed either in patients treated with ACE inhibitors but dialyzed on other membranes (N = 9), nor in patients on AN69 who did not receive ACE inhibitors (N = 19). These anaphylactoid reactions could be due to bradykinin accumulation, as a result of both increased synthesis--by interaction of blood with the AN69 polymer--and catabolism blockade by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "229": "The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of captopril on plasma glucose concentration. The daily profiles of the plasma glucose levels were determined in 12 non-insulin-dependent diabetic normotensive subjects, treated with or without captopril at a dose of 25 mg 3 times/day. Forearm blood flow was also measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. Administration of captopril improved the daily profile of the plasma glucose level. Postprandial forearm blood flow was also augmented 2 h after a meal. These results suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may improve glucose metabolism in diabetic subjects, possibly through enhancement of blood flow to skeletal muscle.", 
    "230": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are now firmly established in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Their beneficial acute and chronic hemodynamic effects are not associated with reflex tachycardia or drug tolerance. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce symptomatic improvement and improve exercise capacity in all grades of heart failure. They also improve the prognosis of patients with severe heart failure. Quinapril is a recently introduced, nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, whose intermediate half-life makes it well-suited for the treatment of patients with CHF. The acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of quinapril are similar to those of other ACE inhibitors. In a large, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 225 patients with mild to moderate CHF, 10 to 40 mg/day quinapril significantly improved clinical status and exercise capacity in a dose-related manner. The incidence of side effects did not differ significantly from that of placebo. The initial studies with quinapril are promising and warrant further clinical investigation of this compound.", 
    "231": "Quinapril hydrochloride is a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has been extensively tested and found effective when administered once-a-day to hypertensive patients of both sexes and all degrees of hypertension and cardiac compromise, including those with left ventricular hypertrophy, with and without congestive heart failure. Observations with earlier ACE inhibitors led to reports that this class of drugs was relatively ineffective in older hypertensive patients. To ascertain the role of quinapril (greater than or equal to 10 mg/day) in older patients, its blood pressure-lowering effects in 1,175 hypertensive patients less than or equal to 65 years of age were compared with those in 304 patients greater than 65 years of age. An excellent response was observed in patients greater than 65 years of age with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic BP, 95 to 105 mm Hg) and moderate to severe hypertension (diastolic BP, 106 to 115 mm Hg). The reductions in blood pressure achieved with quinapril were at least comparable to those obtained in the younger hypertensives, and were numerically (but not statistically) greater in the mild to moderate group (-14 mm Hg v-12 mm Hg). In addition, the percentage of patients who experienced adverse experiences was lower in the greater than 65 group than in the less than or equal to 65 group (15% v 19%). The main adverse experiences reported included dizziness, headache, cough, fatigue, and hypotension. These findings indicate that quinapril is at least as safe and effective in older hypertensives as in younger patients.", 
    "232": "Renal dysfunction and hypertension are closely associated. Hypertension causes approximately 25% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and develops in virtually every patient with advanced renal insufficiency from any cause. Although normalization of blood pressure can reduce mortality from uremia and ameliorate the progression of renal impairment in patients with established renal insufficiency from hypertension and diabetes, antihypertensive therapy alone is not totally effective in preventing progressive compromise of renal function--especially in blacks and diabetics, who are at high risk for developing ESRD. Of particular promise is the rapidly increasing understanding of the intrarenal autocrine and paracrine functions of angiotensin II produced locally by a tissue renin-angiotensin system. Consistent and convincing experimental data have demonstrated that angiotensin II plays many roles in the control of renal function and the kidney's response to injury. The intrarenal effects of angiotensin II include: 1) increase in the efferent arteriolar tone, resulting in increased glomerular capillary pressure, 2) promotion of mesangial cell contraction, 3) stimulation of proximal tubular Na+ reabsorption, and 4) possible growth hormone effects leading to hypertrophy or hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle. Because of their favorable intrarenal hemodynamic effects (particularly reduction of glomerular capillary pressure), ACE inhibitors may provide a renal protective effect in addition to their systemic antihypertensive effects. Clinical trials evaluating the effect of ACE inhibition on the progression of renal insufficiency in hypertensives and diabetics are currently under way. Favorable results could lead to a significant decrease in the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.", 
    "233": "The introduction of orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of hypertensive disorders and provided an effective alternative for the management of congestive heart failure (CHF). By interfering with the formation of angiotensin II, the active agent of the renin system, ACE inhibitors block the system's vasoconstrictive and sodium-retaining effects, with a consequent reduction in systemic blood pressure. The net effect is improved blood flow and reduced cardiac work. Thus, ACE inhibitors are likely to improve cardiac work capacity and quality of life. Their mechanism of action differs markedly from that of traditional antihypertensive agents which lower blood pressure while reducing cardiac output and blood flow. Since the primary action of ACE inhibitors is to block the renin system, a dramatic response to monotherapy suggests a large renin factor while the lack of a response suggests a low-renin state more amenable to treatment with a diuretic or calcium antagonist. Because of their many attributes, ACE inhibitors are increasingly used as first-line therapy for the treatment of hypertension or CHF. The prototype orally active ACE inhibitor, captopril, is a sulfhydryl compound with a good safety profile at the recommended dosages but reported toxicity at higher dosages. Second-generation ACE inhibitors (eg, enalapril and quinapril) are more potent sulfhydryl-free esters with a greater affinity for the converting enzyme. These newer agents are pro-drugs requiring ester hydrolysis to form the active free acid compound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "234": "Studies have examined renal function to determine the role of the kidney in the pathogenesis and maintenance phases of hypertension in the Okamoto-Aoki strain of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). As compared to age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), 4- to 6-week old SHR are moderately hypertensive and have a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF), and an increased renal vascular resistance. Cross-breeding studies indicate the reduction in RBF and GFR in young SHR is genetically linked to the hypertension and thus may be of primary pathogenetic importance. The combination of an elevated vascular resistance and reduced RBF and GFR in young SHR implicates increased activity of a vasoconstrictor system(s), decreased activity of a vasodilator system(s), or both. Observations from several laboratories support the notion that endogenous angiotensin II contributes to the renal vasoconstriction in young SHR during the developmental phase of hypertension. Acute and chronic inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme reduce arterial pressure, reduce renal vascular resistance and increase renal blood flow in young and adult SHR. Renal vascular tone in SHR is more dependent on angiotensin converting enzyme activity than that in WKY. The ability of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to produce renal vasodilation may be responsible, at least in part, for its antihypertensive effects. Other studies indicate that renal vascular reactivity to angiotensin II is exaggerated in young SHR. The strain differences in renal reactivity to angiotensin II can be abolished by cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin, indicating that endogenous prostanoids counteract some of the constrictor action of angiotensin II, with more pronounced buffering activity in WKY.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "235": "Renal failure, once established by loss of a critical amount of functional renal mass, tends to be progressive. A large body of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that glomerular capillary hypertension is important in the pathogenesis of progressive chronic renal failure of diverse types, including subtotal renal ablation and diabetic nephropathy. Converting enzyme inhibitors are effective in slowing or arresting the progression of glomerular injury in these experimental models, in association with normalization of both systemic and intrarenal pressures. Clinical studies of diabetic nephropathy and chronic renal failure of other etiologies support the concept that these same renal hemodynamic factors are important in human renal disease and that treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors may prove to be a useful therapeutic intervention. Whether the converting enzyme inhibitors have specific advantages over other antihypertensive agents due to beneficial renal hemodynamic effects, as suggested by experimental studies, is a question that awaits further investigation. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of hypertensive glomerular injury is complex and involves the participation of diverse biologic systems. We predict that a wide variety of therapeutic maneuvers, with disparate mechanisms of action, may be effective in arresting or preventing glomerular injury.", 
    "236": "The use of converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) has permitted us to assess the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the control of arterial pressure and renal function in various conditions. In renal transplant recipients treated by azathioprine and steroids, the occurrence of CEI-induced deterioration of renal function is highly suggestive of renal artery stenosis, whereas renal vasodilatation associated with unchanged glomerular filtration rate in response to CEI is indicative of a significant role of native kidneys. In hypertensive recipients without renal artery stenosis, the absence of renal hemodynamic changes after CEI may be predictive of subsequent chronic rejection. The information provided by CEI is rather different in cyclosporine treated subjects. In this setting, no acute effect of CEI on renal hemodynamics is detectable. Whether the renal response to CEI is similar in cyclosporine when compared to conventionally treated patients with renal artery stenosis remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "237": "The medium-term (16 weeks) effects of the combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on some metabolic indexes, particularly on plasma lipoproteins, were evaluated in 20 mild to moderate hypertensive outpatients. After a 4-week wash-out period, the subjects were given one tablet of a new commercially available fixed combination once/daily (i.e., captopril 50 mg + HCTZ 25 mg). The dose could be titrated to a maximum of one tablet twice daily according to individual blood pressure responses. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased at week 4 and showed a further decrease thereafter; the rate of responders (diastolic blood pressure at or below 90 mm Hg at the end of the study) was very high (90%). The only metabolic change was a small though significant increase in HDL cholesterol (P less than .05), almost entirely due to an increase in the denser HDL3 subfraction. The atherogenic fractions, namely total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoprotein B, showed no significant changes. Plasma triglycerides underwent a transient increase at week 8 (P less than .05) but thereafter fell. Plasma glucose, creatinine, uric acid, and potassium were unchanged. The fixed combination of captopril and HCTZ seems highly effective in lowering blood pressure and seems devoid of untoward metabolic effects. Its overall impact on the coronary risk profile in hypertensive subjects seems therefore to be favorable.", 
    "238": "To further assess the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the control of blood pressure (BP), continuous recordings of BP were performed in conscious freely moving rats that had received daily injections of guanethidine or saline from 7 to 90 days of age. Guanethidine extensively destroyed the peripheral sympathetic fibers as indicated by marked decreases in the norepinephrine content of the heart and kidneys and the absence of pressor response to tyramine injection. Such a chronic sympathectomy did not alter the BP and heart rate (HR) levels but markedly enhanced the BP variability while the HR variability and the sensitivity of the cardiac baroreceptor reflex were not altered. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with perindopril induced a rapid fall in BP and normalized the BP variability in sympathectomized animals. It is concluded that in rats, the SNS is not necessary for the full development of the BP level but is essential to buffer the spontaneous variability of BP. After sympathectomy, BP is maintained at nearly normal levels mainly through activation of the renin angiotensin system.", 
    "239": "The deranged autonomic control of heart rate was studied in 34 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II to III) by examining the carotid sinus baroreflex. The carotid sinus baroreceptors were stimulated by graded suction. The slope of the regression line between increases in cycle length and the degree of neck suction was taken as an index of baroreflex sensitivity. The reflex response is mediated by a selective increase of vagal efferent activity. Baroreflex sensitivity therefore represents a measure of vagal reactivity. Using multiple regression analysis, baroreflex sensitivity (BS) correlated positively to stroke volume index (SVI) and inversely to plasma renin activity (PRA) and to age: BS = 0.47 SVI - 0.38 PRA - 0.23 age + constant (r = 0.74; p less than 0.0005). In addition to digitalis and diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril or enalapril) were given to 16 patients for a mean of 17 +/- 3 days. The patients with hemodynamic improvement (group A) exhibited improved baroreflex sensitivity (1.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.6 +/- 1.2 msec/mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Baroreflex sensitivity remained unchanged (3.1 +/- 0.8 to 2.4 +/- 1.0 msec/mm Hg; n.s.) in the patients without hemodynamic improvement (group B). The increase in reflex sensitivity did not correlate with hemodynamic alterations. Baroreflex sensitivity during ACE inhibition (BSD) was only related to the baseline baroreflex sensitivity (BSB): BSD = 2.8 BSB - 0.46 (r = 0.84; p less than 0.005). In patients with heart failure, reflex bradycardia decreases with age and with PRA and increases with stroke volume. Chronic therapy with ACE inhibitors enhances vagal reactivity in patients with hemodynamic improvement.", 
    "240": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have several side effects of concern to the otolaryngologist. Angioedema is a rare, but potentially lethal adverse effect when associated with upper airway obstruction. Four cases of ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema, three with significant upper airway obstruction, are reported. Angioedema secondary to ACE inhibition appears to be mechanism based. The probable link is the potentiation of bradykinin, which results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and angioedema. Since angioedema can progress to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists must be aware of this association. The differential diagnosis and treatment of this adverse effect is discussed, as well as a review of ACE inhibitors and other causes of angioedema.", 
    "241": "In patients with renovascular hypertension, it is unknown whether the angiotensin converting enzyme-(ACE) inhibited renal scan will identify stenosis of a segmental branch of a single renal artery or of an accessory artery where multiple renal arteries are present. Since multiple renal arteries may be present in approximately 25% of all individuals, it will be important to establish whether the ACE-inhibited renal scan is useful in this population. We report a case of stenosis involving a renal artery in a patient with multiple renal arteries, successfully identified by ACE-inhibited renal scintigraphy.", 
    "242": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on cardiovascular mass and function were measured in three groups of 22 week old male Wistar-Kyoto normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with CGS-16617, cilazapril or quinapril. Left ventricular performance was assessed by electromagnetic flow meter during rapid whole blood infusion before and after arterial pressure and increased abruptly with aortic snare; aortic distensibility also was assessed in vitro. The systemic hemodynamic effects of these three agents were similar, yet their structural effects varied. Although left ventricular and aortic masses diminished and right ventricular mass remained unchanged (with all three agents) in the spontaneously hypertensive rats, CGS-11617 and cilazapril also reduced left ventricular mass in the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats without changing aortic mass. All three agents improved aortic distensibility whether or not mass was decreased. Left ventricular structural changes were associated with variable changes in pumping ability. These data show that reduced mass associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment was not consistent in ventricles and aorta, that a dissociation exists between structural and functional changes and that reduction of cardiac mass alone does not relate to changes in chamber mass or in function. Thus, biologic and pharmacodynamic differences exist among angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as well as between classes of antihypertensive agents.", 
    "243": "Rats of the spontaneously hypertensive strain develop kidney damage that resembles the nephropathy seen in some cases of human essential hypertension. Previous studies with a triple drug antihypertensive regimen indicated that proteinuria and glomerular histopathology in spontaneously hypertensive rats might develop despite long-term effective control of systemic blood pressure. To investigate further the relation between hypertension and kidney disease, a group of spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with enalapril at 15 weeks of age. Blood pressure, protein excretion, and kidney function were measured in those rats at regular intervals during the next year and a half and were compared with untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats and the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto parent strain. Kidney tissue samples from all three groups, collected at autopsy, were stained by immunohistochemical and conventional methods to assess the relative severity and nature of kidney damage. Although enalapril therapy was completely effective in controlling the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats, it only postponed the onset of kidney disease. Enalapril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats eventually exhibited albuminuria as severe as that found in hypertensive rats. Kidney vessel pathology was completely prevented with enalapril, but the abnormal accumulation of mononuclear cells in tubulointerstitial and periglomerular sites was the same as in untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats. We have concluded that elevated protein excretion in rats of the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain is not a secondary consequence of systemic hypertension. Structural abnormalities of renal vessels also do not appear to contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of albuminuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Other explanations must be sought to account for the close link between spontaneous hypertension and kidney damage in this animal model. The clear dissociation of kidney disease from systemic hypertension exhibited by spontaneously hypertensive rats may also be relevant for human disease.", 
    "244": "Recent studies have demonstrated that short-term angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril can reduce urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) after exercise in normotensive diabetic patients with early-stage nephropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this effect of ACE inhibition was due to a systemic hypotensive action or a specific action at the intrarenal level. Thus, we compared the acute effects of captopril and the Ca2(+)-channel blocker nifedipine on exercise-induced UAER in normotensive (blood pressure less than 165/95 mmHg) diabetic patients who were normoalbuminuric or microalbuminuric at rest (stage 2 or 3 of diabetic nephropathy). Twenty-five stage 2 diabetic nephropathy patients, 39 stage 3 diabetic nephropathy patients, and 12 nondiabetic subjects performed five submaximal cycloergometric exercises (90% of theoretical heart rate) on nonconsecutive days. The first two exercises were performed in basal conditions; the next three exercises were performed 24 h after administration of captopril (25 mg twice daily) or nifedipine AR (20 mg twice daily) or placebo (1 tablet twice daily) according to a randomized double-blind crossover trial. After placebo, blood pressure and UAER did not change at rest or 1 h after exercise. After captopril, blood pressure at rest and during exercise was similar to that observed after placebo. UAER at rest was not modified, whereas 1 h after exercise, it was significantly decreased both in stage 2 and stage 3 diabetic nephropathy patients (P less than 0.001). After nifedipine, blood pressure decreased significantly at rest and during exercise in respect to placebo and captopril. UAER at rest did not change significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "245": "It has been suggested that cough from captopril may originate from an increased sensitivity of receptors in the extrathoracic airway (EA). To explore this hypothesis, we assessed the responsiveness of EA and bronchi and the cough sensitivity to inhaled histamine in nine hypertensive patients with captopril-induced cough (group 1) during treatment and one month after withdrawal of the drug treatment. Nine patients who were asymptomatic while receiving captopril (group 2) and nine patients receiving no current treatment (group 3) served as controls. The EA responsiveness was assessed by using the maximal midinspiratory flow (MIF50) as an arbitrary index of EA constriction and was expressed as the histamine concentration causing a 25 percent decrease in MIF50 (PC25MIF50). PC15FEV1 was the index of bronchial responsiveness and PCcough (dose causing five or more coughs) was that of cough sensitivity. Airway hyperresponsiveness (EA-HR or BHR) was diagnosed when PC25MIF50 or PC15FEV1 were 8 mg/ml or lower. Patients with captopril-cough, as compared with controls, had significantly lower values of PC25MIF50, PC15FEV1, and PCcough; EA-HR and BHR were found, respectively, in seven and three of these patients and in none of the control subjects. In all the patients of group 1, cough and EA-HR resolved after withdrawal of captopril treatment, while BHR persisted in one. PC25MIF50, PC15FEV1, and PCcough were all significantly improved. Our findings suggest that cough during captopril therapy may originate from receptors in the EA.", 
    "246": "There is a varying hormonal activation in heart failure. To be able to evaluate this activation and relate it to prognosis, we took blood samples at baseline and after 6 weeks from 239 patients with severe heart failure (all in New York Heart Association class IV) randomized to additional treatment with enalapril or placebo. In this study (CONSENSUS), which has previously been reported, there was a significant reduction in mortality among patients treated with enalapril. The present data show in the placebo group a significant positive relation between mortality and levels of angiotensin II (p less than 0.05), aldosterone (p = 0.003), noradrenaline (p less than 0.001), adrenaline (p = 0.001), and atrial natriuretic factor (p = 0.003). A similar relation was not observed among the patients treated with enalapril. Significant reductions in mortality in the groups of patients treated with enalapril were consistently found among patients with baseline hormone levels above median values. There were significant reductions in hormone levels from baseline to 6 weeks in the group of patients treated with enalapril for all hormones except adrenaline. There were no correlations between these changes in hormone levels. Summarily, there is a pronounced but variable neurohormonal activation in heart failure even in patients with similar clinical findings. This activation is reduced by enalapril therapy. The results suggest that the effect of enalapril on mortality is related to hormonal activation in general and the renin-angiotensin system in particular.", 
    "247": "The authors retrospectively analyzed the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in 63 consecutive patients with aortic dissection who underwent thoracic and abdominal aortography. Ten patients (16%) had renal artery stenosis, five with atherosclerosis and five with fibromuscular lesions. Risk factors for aortic dissection were Marfan disease in nine patients, bicuspid aortic valve in one, and hypertension in 54 (including seven patients with Marfan syndrome). If the patients with Marfan syndrome and the patient with the bicuspid aortic valve are excluded, renal artery stenosis was present in 10 of 53 patients (19%) when the cause of dissection was presumably hypertension. This finding suggests that renovascular hypertension is a greater risk factor for aortic dissection than is essential hypertension. The success of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) in controlling renovascular hypertension has been proved. In this series, emergent PTRA successfully controlled the hypertension in one patient with a type B dissection, resulting in an excellent clinical outcome. Angiography should be routinely performed on patients with aortic dissections to evaluate for renal artery stenosis.", 
    "248": "Accumulating data indicate that tissue and systemic renin-angiotensin systems may coexist. Evidence supporting the existence of local regulatory systems derives from several sources. Firstly, it has been clearly demonstrated that all components of the renin-angiotensin system are detectable in the tissues of organs such as the brain, heart, lung, kidney, testis, and blood vessels. Secondly, many diverse actions of angiotensin II have been defined in different tissues, all of which have a common mechanism: maintaining or increasing vascular tone, blood volume, or both. Evidence supporting the concept that the local and systemic renin-angiotensin systems are functionally independent includes the discrepancy in the time courses of hemodynamic changes and enzyme inhibition following administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; and the observation that ACE inhibitor treatment results in decreases in blood pressure in anephric subjects, who have extremely low circulating concentrations of angiotensin II. These and other data suggest that inhibition of tissue ACE may be as, or more, important than its effects on the more easily measured circulating ACE. This raises the question of whether there are differences among ACE inhibitors in their selectivity for one or more organ systems. Some experimental data indicate that the binding affinity and time course of ACE inhibition can vary from one tissue to another, and among individual agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "249": "The effects of SH-containing (captopril, epi-captopril, and the free-SH form of zofenopril) and non-SH-containing (enalaprilat and lisinopril) angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on free radical injury in cultured endothelial cells were studied. When cultured endothelial cells were exposed to a superoxide and hydroxyl radical generating system (dihydroxyfumarate + Fe3(+)-ADP) for 30 min, lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA) formation] occurred, and cellular viability (trypan blue exclusion) decreased to 41%; concomitantly, plasma membrane blebbing, assessed by scanning electron microscopy, occurred in 65% of the cells. Preincubation of the cells with each of the SH-agents before free radical addition resulted in an equipotent concentration-dependent (10-200 microM) inhibition (15-60%) of MDA formation; both losses in cellular viability and percent blebbed cells were reduced significantly (P less than 0.05) by concentrations as low as 10 microM of each SH-agent. However, neither of the non-SH agents up to 200 microM produced any major effect. When the effects on hydroxyl radical formation in the system were assessed by ESR spin-trapping with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), concentrations of 10 and 50 microM of the SH-agents reduced the intensity of the DMPO-OH adducts 20 and 50% respectively. Similar results were observed when the hydroxyl radical was generated from the Fenton-reagents (Fe2+ + H2O2), suggesting direct hydroxyl radical scavenging. Thus, these results demonstrate that the SH-containing ACE agents are capable of protecting the endothelial cells against free radical induced lipid peroxidation and cell injury; the mechanism may be due to direct hydroxyl radical scavenging.", 
    "250": "The reaction of the renin-angiotensin system to acute angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was investigated in a single-blind, crossover study in nine normal volunteers receiving two out of three regimens in random order: the new converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril (20 mg once or 5 mg four times at 6-hour intervals) or enalapril (20 mg). Plasma converting enzyme activity, drug levels, angiotensin I and angiotensin II, active renin, and aldosterone were measured before and 1-4 hours and 14-30 hours after drug intake. Baseline in vitro plasma converting enzyme activity was 97 +/- 15 nmol/ml/min (mean +/- SD) when Hip-Gly-Gly was used as substrate, but with carbobenzoxy-Phe-His-Leu (Z-Phe-His-Leu) or angiotensin I as substrate it was only 20 +/- 4 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 nmol/ml/min, respectively. Discriminating power at peak converting enzyme inhibition was enhanced with the two latter substrates. In vivo converting enzyme activity was estimated by the plasma angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio, which correlated well with in vitro converting enzyme activity using Z-Phe-His-Leu as substrate (r = 0.76, n = 252). Angiotensin II levels returned to baseline less than 24 hours after drug administration, whereas in vitro and in vivo converting enzyme activity remained considerably inhibited and active renin together with angiotensin I levels were still elevated. A close linear relation was found between plasma angiotensin II and the angiotensin I/drug level ratio (r = 0.91 for benazeprilat and r = 0.88 for enalaprilat, p less than 0.001). Thus, plasma angiotensin II truly reflects the resetting of the renin-angiotensin system at any degree of converting enzyme inhibition. The ratio of plasma angiotensin II to angiotensin I represents converting enzyme inhibition more accurately than in vitro assays, which vary considerably depending on substrates and assay conditions used.", 
    "251": "1. The effects of chronic oral administration of inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on the vascular renin-angiotensin system were studied. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally with five ACE inhibitors, captopril, enalapril, ramipril, cilazapril and CS-622 (10 mg/kg per day), for periods of 1-2 weeks. Their mesenteric arteries were then isolated and perfused in vitro with Krebs'-Ringer solution, and the angiotensin II (AII) released into the perfusate was measured under unstimulated and isoproterenol-stimulated conditions. The vascular renin activity was also determined after treatments with ACE inhibitors. 3. Treatment with captopril for 1 week suppressed the isoproterenol-stimulated increase in AII release, but had little effect on the baseline release. Oral treatment with captopril for 2 weeks or with other ACE inhibitors for 1 week markedly inhibited both the unstimulated and stimulated release of AII from the mesenteric vasculature. 4. Both the vascular renin activity and the plasma renin activity increased on captopril treatment, but their changes with time were different. 5. These results indicate that virtually complete inhibition of the vascular renin-angiotensin system can be achieved after prolonged treatment with ACE inhibitors, and suggest that the chronic antihypertensive action of ACE inhibitors is not solely due to inhibition of the plasma renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "252": "The remodelling of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction results from the expansion of the infarcted zone in the acute phase and the dilation of the healthy zone of the left ventricle which complicates the initial expansion. It brings about an increase in the left ventricular volume which is a major pejorative prognosis factor after myocardial infarction. The expansion, defined by the dilation and parietal stricture of the infarcted zone, complicates about 30 p. cent of the infarctions and appears in the first hours of the infarction. It is favoured by the transmural nature of the infarction, by its extent and its previous topography, and by arterial hypertension. It is accompanied by a higher mortality rate, increases the risk of parietal rupture, exposes to post-infarction aneurysm and to intraventricular thrombi, and initializes the ventricular remodelling, factor of secondary cardiac failure. The dilation of the healthy zone of the left ventricle is observed mainly in case of initial expansion. Its importance increases with the size of the infarction. It corresponds to the volume overload secondary to the increase in the telediastolic parietal constraint of the left ventricle. The remodelling of the left ventricle after infarction is limited by captopril, and possibly by the restoration of the blood flow in the artery responsible for the infarction. Captopril, administered in the first weeks following the infarction, limits the dilation of the left ventricle in man as well as in animals. This beneficial effect is due to a decrease in the post-load of the left ventricle. Captopril improves the survival after infarction in animals, but its effect on the post-infarction mortality in man is still under study.", 
    "253": "In a double-blind study, after a four- to six-week placebo period, 418 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to receive 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg of fosinopril or matched placebo orally once daily for four weeks. Seated diastolic blood pressure was determined 24 hours after the most recent dose. For patients with an inadequate blood pressure response after four weeks, doses were doubled during the second four weeks, and hydrochlorothiazide was added during the final four weeks. The patients showed a significant, consistent antihypertensive response in seated and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures after four weeks of 20 or 40 mg of fosinopril; both dosages produced similar responses. The results indicate that the dose level of fosinopril required to treat uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension ranges from 5 to 40 mg taken once daily. Treatment was discontinued in 3% of the fosinopril patients and in 1% of the placebo patients because of side effects. No clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results were reported. Fosinoprilat, the active diacid of fosinopril, is eliminated by both the hepatobiliary and renal routes, which suggests that fosinopril may be particularly useful in the treatment of patients with impaired kidney or liver function and of elderly patients.", 
    "254": "Left ventricular dysfunction is asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic for a long time. It would be beneficial if progression to the symptomatic stages could be prevented. This is only possible when the abnormal conditions of cardiac load or perfusion which cause the myocardial disease, can be corrected. The treatment of hypertension or valvular disease is an example of this approach. Another approach is to reduce the perverse effects of the neurohormonal adaptations to cardiac failure. The treatment of chronic myocardial infarction by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is an example of this approach.", 
    "255": "Hypertension and renal mass reduction induce glomerular hypertension (GH), hyperfiltration (HF) and renal injury. GH may contribute to allograft loss in post-transplant hypertensive patients (PT x HT). HF and GH may be evaluated by renal response to acute protein intake (API). Since ACE inhibition may prevent GH, the effects of fosinopril (Fos) were evaluated in 10 PT X HT on azathioprine and prednisone. Patients received 5 to 40 mg/day of Fos during 12 months. Baseline MAP (111.1 +/- 2.9 mm Hg) was significantly reduced by 10 to 12 mm Hg, rising to 114.7 +/- 2.7 mm Hg after Fos was administered. GFR (63.7 +/- 5.9 ml/min) decreased after 4 (48.1 +/- 4.6, P less than 0.05) and 12 months (50.7 +/- 4.6, P less than 0.05), rising to 59.4 +/- 5.6 after Fos was given. There was no GFR response to API before and after one month of Fos, however, a clear response became apparent at 4 (+ 27% P less than 0.05), and 12 months (+ 18%, P less than 0.05), disappearing after Fos discontinuation. Proteinuria (918.8 +/- 710.6 mg/d) decreased after 4 (72.3 +/- 21.6 mg/d, P less than 0.05) and 12 months, rising to 297.8 +/- 172.3 mg/day after therapy. GFR response to API in 22 controls and 17 uninephrectomized donors was 13 and 11%, respectively. Lack of response to API in PT x HT suggests HF and GH. Reduction of GFR, restoration of response to API and reduction of proteinuria, indicate that ACE inhibition with fosinopril ameliorates HF and GH. This effect may be beneficial in preventing hemodynamic-mediated allograft injury.", 
    "256": "The function of the endothelium is impaired in hypertension. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), acetylcholine-induced relaxation is decreased and serotonin-induced constriction is increased. The goal of our study was to evaluate the effect of a long-term treatment with cilazapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or hydralazine, a vasodilator, on the endothelium-dependent responses in aorta of SHR. Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as normotensive reference. Isolated aortic rings with or without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers. The rings with intact endothelium were contracted with norepinephrine. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was markedly enhanced by cilazapril treatment. The tension achieved at maximal relaxation was 8 +/- 4% of norepinephrine contraction in the cilazapril-treated SHR versus 55 +/- 5% in the untreated SHR (p less than 0.001). Hydralazine had no significant effect. The effect of serotonin was also markedly modified by cilazapril. In untreated SHR, serotonin induced the release of a vasoconstrictor substance by the endothelium as assessed by the ratio of maximal tension induced by serotonin in rings with endothelium over maximal tension in rings without endothelium, which was greater than 1. This ratio was reversed in cilazapril-treated SHR but not in hydralazine-treated SHR. Captopril had effects similar to cilazapril. Finally, evaluation of carotid arteries showed that cilazapril also prevented morphological changes of the intima in SHR (i.e., infiltration by mononuclear cells). We conclude that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors prevent the functional and morphological alterations in endothelium that are found in hypertension and speculate that this action might participate in their antihypertensive effect.", 
    "257": "Angioedema is a well-recognized edema involving the deeper layers of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa. From July 1986 to July 1989 the authors have observed and treated 10 patients admitted to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) Hospitals in Richmond, Virginia, with life-threatening angioedema as a complication of enalapril or captopril ingestion. Both drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prescribed for antihypertensive activity and the ability to improve symptoms in patients with congestive heart failure. We describe the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these patients, as well as reasons for each occurrence. Sporadic reports of angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitor therapy have appeared in the literature. This represents the first time a significant series of patients from the same institution have encountered this complication over a short period of time, suggesting that the complication may be much more common than has been thought.", 
    "258": "Left ventricular failure results from many myocardial diseases: the symptoms of left ventricular failure are the consequence of adaptations which the left ventricle and circulatory system activate to counteract the initial myocardial disease. The aims of treatment of cardiac failure are diverse depending on whether treatment is directed to correct the initial myocardial disease, its myocardial consequences, its circulatory consequences or, more simply, the patient's symptoms. The ideal treatment of cardiac failure would include a drug acting on the cause, a drug restoring left ventricular contraction and relaxation adapted to the conditions of cardiac load, a drug correcting regional blood flow disturbances and a drug relieving symptoms related to salt retention. An ideal drug for chronic left ventricular failure does not exist, and so treatment is a composite effort. Should it be in first intention? This is the current trend.", 
    "259": "Many practical difficulties are encountered by physicians in the medical treatment of chronic cardiac failure. They are related to the choice of drug guided by therapeutic objectives: vasodilators and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are no longer drugs of secondary intention reserved for chronic cardiac failure, but there is no information as to the place of these drugs in early stages of myocardial dysfunction before the appearance of the clinical signs of cardiac failure. Other difficulties are related to the use of many different drugs, to the many secondary effects, sometimes increased by drug interactions; these difficulties are accentuated by the multiplicity of the etiologies of cardiac failure, by the frequency of associated extracardiac disease and by the risks inherent to abnormal myocardial function. In addition, the prescriber must not forget that the drug is not everything in the treatment of cardiac failure and he must be able to recognise the pathology underlying the cardiac failure which may require specific therapy. Finally, the physician must decide the optimal timing for referring patients with very severe cardiac failure for transplantation.", 
    "260": "The discordance frequently observed between the hemodynamic effects of treatment and change in functional status may be explained by the fact that symptoms are related more to the circulatory changes caused by the heart failure than the heart failure itself. This is why angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and controlled exercise training improve exercise capacity of patients with chronic cardiac failure more than inotropic agents and direct vasodilator therapy, partly because of their marked beneficial effect on regional blood flow.", 
    "261": "Over 30 per cent of coronary patients die of cardiac failure excluding the acute phase of myocardial infarction. With the exception of preexisting hypertension, there is no compensatory hypertrophy in ischemic heart disease. However, hypertrophy is a costly adaptation in terms of myocardial oxygen demand and, therefore, coronary flow. Fibrous zones are unresponsive to inotropic drugs and so the treatment of cardiac failure due to ischemic heart disease consists in limiting or preventing episodes of ischemia. Each mechanism of ischemia has an appropriate treatment: the preload is reduced by trinitrin and its derivatives and by molsidomine; the after-load by calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; tachycardia and hypercontractile states by betablockers. The risk of arrhythmia, aggravated by many inotropic therapies, constitutes the major danger to ischemic heart failure; amiodarone, betablockers and preventive nitrate therapy are the most effective and least dangerous antiarrhythmics. Revascularisation is effective for permanently ischemic segments or for ischemia on effort but does not improve large plaques of fibrosis which sometimes require surgical ablation or plastic procedures. But these measures are incomplete if all aspects of the disease are not taken in consideration: loss of excessive body weight, exercise rehabilitation by modern techniques, limitation of bed rest at the ultimate stage of the disease allowing patients with ischemic cardiac failure a better quality of life without aggravating the prognosis.", 
    "262": "Given the absence of curative and preventive treatment of cardiac failure, symptomatic therapy is very important. In severe \"non-ambulatory\" cardiac failure, symptoms depend on the patient's resting hemodynamic status. This can be improved by diuretics, digitalis and vasodilators. A combination of these three drug groups is often required. However, the respective value of each group is unknown. Their use is limited by their specific undesirable secondary effects which are particularly common and severe at this advanced stage. Their effects on survival are unknown with the exception of angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors which have been shown to be beneficial. At the ambulatory stage symptoms occur on effort. In order to improve exercise capacity, the treatment chosen should increase the patient's reserve of cardiac output, limit the increase in pulmonary pressures, respect systemic arterial pressure, decrease venous pressure, dilate the muscular arterioles and improve oxygen extraction by skeletal muscle during physical exercise. Diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can fulfill these objectives. The effects of the other vasodilators are more variable, due to a vasodilatation which is often inappropriate and to tachyphylaxis related to reflex activation of neuro-hormonal mechanisms. Digitalis and some vasodilator inotropic agents can improve symptoms and effort capacity. However, doubts over possible deleterious effects on mortality have to be cleared by large scale, controlled therapeutic trials. Symptoms of cardiac failure at the ambulatory stage and the effects of treatment on these symptoms should logically be evaluated by appropriate ergometric exercise stress testing, with measurement of the patient's maximum oxygen consumption whenever possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "263": "In the present work the clinical, biological, radiological, electrocardiographic and hormonal characteristics are analyzed in 51 patients suffering mild essential hypertension, in whom treatment with captopril in monotherapy or associated to chlortalidone managed to normalize arterial pressure and maintained the pressure control during a period of one year. Captopril in monotherapy at a dose of 50 to 150 mg/day normalized blood pressure in 34 patients (66.7%) while in the remaining 17 patients (33.3%) the association of 25 mg of Chlortalidone was required. When comparing the subgroup of patients whose blood pressure levels were controlled with captopril as the only used drug (Group A) against those who required the association with diuretics (Group B), we could only observe significant differences regarding the blood pressure level and cardiothoracic index, being these higher in the group of patients who required pharmacologic association. We conclude that only the severity of hypertension allows to predict the necessity of associating a diuretic to captopril in order to obtain the control of blood pressure levels.", 
    "264": "The maximal exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is frequently decreased because of decreased skeletal muscle oxygen utilization. In this study we examined whether forearm oxygen utilization is decreased during dynamic handgrip exercise in patients with CHF and whether captopril improves forearm oxygen utilization. They were divided into 3 groups according to the level of plasma renin activity (PRA) and New York Heart Association functional classification (NYHA): Group 1 consisted of 7 normal (control) subjects (PRA: 0.5 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/h, NYHA: 0); Group 2, 7 patients with severe CHF (PRA: 11.3 +/- 3.9 ng/ml/h, NYHA: 3.6 +/- 0.3); Group 3, 4 patients with mild CHF (PRA: 2.4 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/h, NYHA: 2 +/- 0). Forearm blood flow was measured by a strain gauge plethysmograph at rest and during dynamic handgrip exercise. Regional arterial venous oxygen content was measured and forearm oxygen consumption was calculated by the Fick principle. Forearm blood flow was less (p less than 0.05) at rest and during exercise in patients with severe CHF than in control subjects; this was compensated for by increased oxygen extraction, thus maintaining forearm oxygen consumption at a normal level at rest and during submaximal exercise. During maximal exercise, oxygen extraction was not different between normal control subjects and patients with severe CHF, thus forearm oxygen consumption was significantly less (p less than 0.01) in patients with severe CHF than in control subjects. In patients with mild CHF, forearm blood flow, oxygen extraction and oxygen consumption were not different from those in normal control subjects. Captopril (25 mg orally) did not alter forearm hemodynamics at rest and during exercise in control subjects and patients with mild CHF. In patients with severe CHF, captopril lowered systolic and mean blood pressure (p less than 0.05). Captopril increased forearm oxygen extraction (p less than 0.05) and tended to increase blood flow and thus increased oxygen consumption (p less than 0.01) during maximal exercise. Our data indicate that oxygen utilization was impaired in patients with severe CHF and that captopril improved forearm oxygen utilization during maximal handgrip exercise in patients with severe CHF.", 
    "265": "The acute effects of single doses of captopril (C) 12.5 mg, of nifedipine (N) 10 mg, or of their combination (C + N) on parameters of left ventricular (LV) function were assessed in 18 elderly hypertensive subjects using radionuclide ventriculography. Blood pressure (BP) was lowered by C from 177/100 to 164/92 mmHg, by N from 177/100 to 161/91 mmHg (p less than 0.02/less than 0.05 for both C and N) and by C + N from 176/100 to 151/83 mmHg (p less than 0.01/less than 0.01). Nifedipine accelerated heart rate from 74 to 85 and C + N from 74 to 82 beats/min (p less than 0.01 in both cases), whereas C left it unchanged. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was not significantly affected by either drug alone or by both drugs combined. Peak ejection rate (PER) and peak filling rate (PFR) were slightly, but not significantly, enhanced by all treatments. Captopril shortened the time to peak filling rate (TPFR) by 21 msec (p less than 0.05), N by 26 msec (p less than 0.01) and their combination by 22 msec (p less than 0.05); however, when corrected for RR interval or length of diastole, TPFR was shortened only by C (p less than 0.05). Tachycardia induced by acute administration of N may have an unwanted effect on LV diastolic function, which can be partially blunted by the concomitant administration of a converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "266": "The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a prospective, randomized, multi-centre intervention trial designed to investigate whether antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril may reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity more than a therapeutic regimen which does not include an ACE inhibitor. Secondary objectives are to compare total mortality, the development or deterioration of ischaemic heart disease, left ventricular failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus and possible differences in renal function in the two groups. Male and female patients with essential hypertension, aged 25-66 years, will be randomly allocated to antihypertensive treatment which will comprise either the use of the ACE inhibitor captopril or will exclude all types of ACE inhibitors. Some 275 hypertension centres and health care centres in Sweden and Finland will take part in this multi-centre trial. A total of 7000 patients will be recruited and studied for an average period of 5 years, the assumption being that a 20% difference in cardiovascular mortality between the two groups can be detected with a power of 80% at the 5% significance level (two-sided test).", 
    "267": "Although the stepped-care approach remains the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy, the patient's profile must also be considered. Important issues include the patient's age, race and activity level, potential for hypertensive complications, presence of other diseases, cost of medications and probability of adherence to the recommended drug regimen. Nonpharmacologic treatment based on lifestyle changes is a useful adjunct to drug therapy, but it is not sufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Selection of pharmacologic therapy must be based on a knowledge of each drug's mode of action and side effects, as well as the characteristics of special patient populations.", 
    "268": "Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker has been used with partial success in cases of primary pulmonary hypertension, as well as to reduce hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) in rats. However, its effect on monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH in rats is not known. We studied the effect of verapamil on MCT-induced PH. Three weeks after a single injection of MCT, significant PH was noted in the MCT-injected rats compared with control (44.35 +/- 3.5 vs. 22 +/- 2.5 mmHg). MCT-injected rats on daily verapamil showed significant reduction in PH (31.5 +/- 3.4 mmHg). The main pulmonary artery of MCT-injected rats revealed subendothelial thickening, thinning and fragmentation of elastic laminae, smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and necrosis or loss of smooth muscle cells, and increased amounts of collagen in media and adventitia. In contrast, the main pulmonary artery of MCT + VP-treated rats showed less intimal thickening, some smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, but little necrosis or loss of cells in addition to disappearance of outer elastic laminae. Smaller pulmonary arteries (less than 150 microns in diameter) in MCT + VP-treated rats showed less medial thickening than MCT groups. However, diminished lung angiotensin-converting enzyme activity suggestive of endothelial cell dysfunction was noted in both MCT and MCT + VP-treated rats. This study indicates that verapamil attenuates MCT-induced PH, but has no effect on pulmonary endothelial cell dysfunction.", 
    "269": "Since renin angiotensin (RA) system discovery during 1930 decade, its physiopathological importance was only recently demonstrated with the dramatic therapeutic value of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The tissular localisation of some of its compounds progressively lead to the concept of a tissular RA system. However non consensus can be established concerning either its existence or its physiological role. The distribution of the classical components of the RA system in the cardiac and other tissues is not homogenous enough to demonstrate the existence of such a functional and coherent system. Numerous technical problems concerning dosage methodologies are encountered especially with angiotensin II determination and must rend cautious when interpreting data. Non specific actions of ACE inhibitors can explain discrepancies between their effects and the level of RA system activation. Indeed they interfere with other systems such as prostaglandins, leucotriens, bradykinins, free radicals. Different tissues such as those of the cardiovascular system directly interfere with angiotensin II production. However, mechanisms and enzymatic reactions that are involved in such a production are multiple and their respective roles remain to be determined.", 
    "270": "We present a radiometric assay for the determination of urinary angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, using benzoyl-[1-14C]glycyl-L-histidyl-L-leucine as the substrate. An optimal pH of 8.3, an optimal chloride concentration of 0.375 mol/l and complete inhibition by EDTA-Na2, captopril and enalaprilat confirm the specificity of the assay. Comparison of dialysis and ultrafiltration for concentration of urine showed the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in human urine. Dialysis against water was the more effective method for avoiding enzyme inhibition. After dialysis of urine, the assay was linear with time and with enzyme concentration; it was highly sensitive (60 mU/l) and showed good reproducibility. Under our technical conditions, we found angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in urine samples with quantitatively abnormal protein contents, but not in normal urine. Urinary angiotensin-converting enzyme did not correlate with proteinuria nor with water-salt parameters or creatinine. We confirm the kidney tubular epithelial origin of the enzyme, and propose the use of our assay to study urinary angiotensin-converting enzyme as a marker of renal tubular damage.", 
    "271": "Seventeen essential hypertensive patients with normal renal function were treated with a new non-sulphydryl orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazepril, 10 mg given once or twice daily, according to diastolic blood pressure levels, for 6 weeks. In all patients, changes in blood pressure, systemic and renal hemodynamics, plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone and albumin excretions were assessed at the end of a 2-week placebo run-in period and at the end of the study. Benazepril monotherapy controlled blood pressure well. No changes in cardiac output, heart rate or stroke volume were observed, while peripheral vascular resistance was significantly decreased (-11%, P less than 0.05). Plasma volume was unaltered. The glomerular filtration rate was stable, but effective renal plasma flow was increased because of the marked reduction in renal vascular resistance (-35%) and, therefore, the filtration fraction was decreased. Urinary albumin excretion remained unchanged. A significant increase in plasma renin activity (P less than 0.001) and a decrease in urinary aldosterone excretion were seen. No side effects were observed during the treatment period. In conclusion, our results suggest that benazepril alone is an effective antihypertensive agent in patients with essential hypertension. The blood pressure lowering effect is due mainly to systemic vasodilation and is observed up to 24 h after administration of the drug. The vasodilation appears to be more consistent in the renal than in the systemic circulation.", 
    "272": "Chronic hypertension shifts the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation to a higher pressure level. Although acute administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors restores the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation the chronic effects have not received much attention. We studied the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril, on mean arterial pressure, basal cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood flow autoregulation in renovascular hypertensive (two-kidney, one clip model) and normotensive male Wistar rats. Seven weeks after renal artery clipping or sham operation rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of perindopril. The dose was increased from 1 to 8 mg/kg over the first 4 weeks until blood pressure was normalized. Chronic renovascular hypertension caused a marked shift in the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation but did not alter basal cerebral blood flow. Treatment of hypertensive rats with perindopril normalized blood pressure and restored cerebral blood flow autoregulation. Chronic treatment of normotensive rats with perindopril increased basal cerebral blood flow. In conclusion, chronic treatment of renovascular hypertensive rats with perindopril causes a shift in the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation towards the value observed in normotensive rats.", 
    "273": "Strophanthin was shown to increase the blood flow in the external, internal zones of the cortex and the external medulla of the rat kidney without influencing the blood supply to the internal zone of the medulla. Contrikal eliminates the vasodilating effect of the drug in the mentioned zones of the renal tissue and significantly increases its natriuretic action. Indomethacin also prevents the hemodynamic shift occurring in the kidneys under the influence of strophanthin but fails to change the character of the natriuretic effect of the drug. Captopril exerts no influence on the increase of the blood flow in the external medulla but eliminates the vasodilating effect of strophanthin in the cortex and significantly potentiates its natriuretic action.", 
    "274": "The superoxide radical scavenging effects of the SH group in the captopril molecule has been proposed to be the basis of the \"cadioprotective\" effect of this angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in animal models of myocardial injury. We determined the effects of captopril, another ACE inhibitor with an SH group (SQ 26,703), its stereoisomer without ACE inhibitory effect but with an SH group (SQ 14,534), another ACE inhibitor without a SH group (enalaprilat), and N-acetylcysteine on superoxide radical generation by human neutrophils and by the purine-xanthine oxidase reaction. None of the compounds examined decreased superoxide radicals in therapeutic concentrations; however, SH-containing agents directly reduced spectrophotometric absorbance of ferricytochrome C. Thus, SH-containing agents with or without ACE inhibitory effects do not scavenge superoxide radicals.",

At the end of the baseline period, supine diastolic blood pressure (SuDBP) was 105-140 mm Hg on hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg once daily and placebo t.i.d. Patients were randomly assigned to D + HCTZ (n = 29) or C + HCTZ (n = 32) and entered phase II titration of D (100-800 mg b.i.d.) or C (12.5 mg b.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d.). If SuDBP was greater than 99 mm Hg, hydralazine was added (25 mg once daily to 50 mg b.i.d.). If SuDBP was less than or equal to 99 mm Hg, patients entered phase III, a 3-month maintenance period. Demographic profiles were not significantly different between the two groups. Baseline supine BP (mean +/- SEM) was similar in the two groups (D + HCTZ: 182 +/- 3/112 +/- 1; C + HCTZ: 179 +/- 4/113 +/- 1 mm Hg), as was baseline standing BP (D + HCTZ: 175 +/- 3/114 +/- 2; C +/- HCTZ: 173 +/- 4/113 +/- 1 mm Hg).

    "276": "A group of 55 black men with mild or moderate hypertension who were being treated with methyldopa, prazosin, and a thiazide diuretic in combination with sotalol, were studied before and after changing their treatment to captopril and a thiazide diuretic. The level of blood pressure control was similar in the 11 men with mild hypertension but the 44 men with moderate hypertension were less well controlled with captopril and a thiazide diuretic. In the men with moderate hypertension the mean increase in the systolic blood pressure after the change in treatment was 4.7 mmHg (not significant) and in the diastolic pressure 6.2 mmHg (P less than 0.02). The mean blood pressure was higher during treatment with captopril in 37 men and lower in 18 men (P = 0.01). Thirty-seven men found both regimens acceptable and 33 of these men preferred the captopril regimen; however, 15 men said they did not like the captopril regimen while only 4 men did not like the methyldopa/prazosin regimen (P less than 0.01). Side-effects from the captopril regimen were reported by 18 of the men and from the methyldopa/prazosin regimen by 6 men (P less than 0.02). It was concluded that the captopril/thiazide regimen was less effective than the methyldopa/prazosin/sotalol/thiazide regimen for the control of moderate hypertension in this population of black men. Although the men who liked both regimens preferred the captopril regimen, that regimen was associated with significantly more side-effects and was disliked by more of the men than was the methyldopa/prazosin regimen.",

    "279": "During the short-term study, the mean (+/- SE) plasma renin activity was significantly higher in the hypertensive patients with polycystic kidney disease than in the patients with essential hypertension, in the supine (0.36 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.06 ng per liter.second, P = 0.05) and upright positions (1.03 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.08 ng per liter.second, P less than 0.03) and after converting-enzyme inhibition (1.97 +/- 0.28 vs. 0.67 +/- 0.17 ng per liter.second, P less than 0.0006). The mean arterial pressures measured in the supine and upright positions and the plasma aldosterone concentrations measured in the upright position were significantly higher in the normotensive patients with polycystic kidney disease than in the normal subjects. After six weeks of converting-enzyme inhibition, renal plasma flow increased (P less than 0.005), and both renal vascular resistance (P less than 0.007) and the filtration fraction (P less than 0.02) decreased significantly in the hypertensive patients with polycystic kidney disease but not in the patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "280": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is stimulated significantly more in hypertensive patients with polycystic kidney disease than in comparable patients with essential hypertension. The increased renin release, perhaps due to renal ischemia caused by cyst expansion, probably contributes to the early development of hypertension in polycystic kidney disease.", 
    "281": "The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) inhibitor, ramiprilat (2-[N-[(S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl]-L-Ala]-(1S,3S,5S)-2- azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3-carboxylic acid), is shown to exist in tow conformational isomers, cis and trans, which interconvert around the amide bond. The two conformers were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The conformers were identified by nuclear Overhauser effect measurements. From line shape analysis the isomerization rate constants were determined to be kcis----trans = 15 s-1 and ktrans----cis = 5 s-1 at 368 K in [2H]phosphate buffer (p2H 7.5). By enzyme kinetic studies using 3-(2-furylacryloyl)-L-Phe-Gly-Gly as substrate, the trans conformer was found to be the most potent enzyme inhibitor, whereas the cis conformer had a very low inhibitory effect. A new inhibition mechanism is presented for this type of slow, tight-binding inhibitors that contain an amide bond. This mechanism involves an equilibrium between the two conformers and the enzyme-bound inhibitor complex.", 
    "282": "In a double-blind, randomized parallel-group investigation, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor, spirapril, was compared with a calcium antagonist, nitrendipine, in 266 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 96-119 mmHg). The object was to reduce the diastolic blood pressure measured 24 hours after intake of medicine to less than or equal to 90 mmHg. After monotherapy for four weeks with either 20 mg nitrendipine once daily or 12 mg spirapril once daily, the dosages were doubled in the patients in whom the desired blood pressure had not been obtained. After treatment for eight weeks, 12.5 mg hydrochlorthiazide daily was employed as a supplement in patients who had not yet obtained satisfactory blood pressures. Both methods of treatment resulted a lower number of patients who responded and lesser decreases in blood pressure than anticipated. No differences were found in the decreases in blood pressure resulting from the two therapeutic methods. The effect of supplementary hydrochlorthiazide to spirapril treatment was as anticipated while the combination with nitrendipine only resulted in a marginally extra decrease in blood pressure. Nitrendipine resulted in significantly more side effects and more patients defected from the investigation on account of side effects in the nitrendipine group (27%) than in the spirapril group (7%). This investigation had documented the abilities of nitrendipine and spirapril to reduce blood pressure and the side effects associated with this but does not predict whether the preparations can be employed to prevent the complications of hypertension which constitute the indications for treatment. Supplementing nitrendipine therapy with hydrochlorthiazide is not recommended.", 
    "283": "In a randomized 6-month study of 201 patients, the antihypertensive efficiency of the calcium antagonist nitrendipine, the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol, mepindolol, the beta blocker with intrinsic activity and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared as monitored by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements. The study was designed so that a comparable decrease in casual BP values was obtained with all 4 drugs. If normotension was not achieved with monotherapy, a diuretic also was administered. Pretreatment casual BP and mean 24-hour ambulatory BP values did not differ between the 4 groups. Normotension as assessed by casual BP measurements was observed in all 4 groups after 6 months of therapy, there being no significant differences between the groups. However, significantly more diuretics were required in the mepindolol (n = 14) and in the enalapril (n = 20) groups compared to the nitrendipine (n = 5) and metoprolol (n = 7) groups. Despite comparable casual BP control, the 4 groups differed significantly in their mean 24-hour measurements. The greatest systolic and diastolic BP decreases were seen in the metoprolol group. Metoprolol was also the most effective drug in decreasing the frequency of systolic pressure peaks greater than 180 mm Hg. Both beta blockers and enalapril significantly decreased the morning BP increase compared to the values before treatment, while nitrendipine did not. These data show that casual BP measurement is not a good predictor of 24-hour BP in patients taking hypertensive therapy. Despite an equal degree of \"office\" BP control, different antihypertensive regimens do not confer the same degree of \"nonoffice\" BP control.", 
    "284": "The hydrolysis of the porcine 26-residue brain natriuretic peptide (BNP-26) and its counterpart human 28-residue atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-hANP) by pig membrane preparations and purified membrane peptidases was studied. When the two peptides were incubated with choroid plexus membranes, the products being analysed by h.p.l.c., alpha-hANP was degraded twice as fast as BNP. The h.p.l.c. profiles of alpha-hANP hydrolysis, in short incubations with choroid plexus membranes, yielded alpha hANP' as the main product, this having been previously shown to be the result of hydrolysis at the Cys7-Phe8 bond. In short incubations this cleavage was inhibited 84% by 1 microM-phosphoramidon, a specific inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.11. BNP-26 was hydrolysed by choroid plexus membranes, kidney microvillar membranes and purified endopeptidase-24.11 in a manner that yielded identical h.p.l.c. profiles. In the presence of phosphoramidon, hydrolysis by the choroid plexus membranes was 94% inhibited. Captopril had no effect and, indeed, no hydrolysis of BNP-26 by peptidyl dipeptidase A (angiotensin-converting enzyme) was observed even after prolonged incubation with the purified enzyme. The stepwise hydrolysis of BNP-26 by endopeptidase-24.11 was investigated by sequencing the peptides produced during incubation. The initial product resulted from hydrolysis at Ser14-Leu15, thereby opening the ring. This product (BNP') was short-lived; further degradation involved hydrolysis at Ile12-Gly13, Arg8-Leu9, Gly17-Leu18, Val22-Leu23, Arg11-Ile12 and Cys4-Phe5. Thus endopeptidase-24.11 is the principal enzyme in renal microvillar and choroid plexus membranes hydrolysing BNP-26 and alpha-hANP.", 
    "285": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are mixed vasodilators with a prolonged sustained effect in chronic heart failure. They also act on the reactivity of peripheral circulation, on ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction, on myocardial hypertrophy in arterial hypertension and on ventricular hyperexcitability. They alleviate the symptoms of symptomatic heart failure, and they constitute the only treatment that has been able to improve the survival of patients with the most severe heart failure. Several studies are in progress to determine whether these drugs should be used as first-line therapy.", 
    "286": "Before it reaches the decompensation stage, heart failure is characterized by symptoms which occur only during exercise. It is therefore rational to believe that the effectiveness of treatments of heart failure should be evaluated by the improvement they produce in tolerance to stress. This tolerance can be evaluated by exercise tests which may take different forms. The most common is a progressive load test on bicycle ergometer or treadmill. Among the indices used to assess tolerance to stress, the total duration of the exercise test until symptoms develop is a variable subject to fluctuations which may be independent of the patient's cardiovascular state. Measurement of oxygen consumption at peak exercise level is usually preferred, being unrelated to the nature of the stress and much more reproducible and sensitive to changes. Among the pharmacological treatments of heart failure, only chronic vasodilator therapy, notably with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, has proved constantly effective on the various ergometric indices. In the literature, the effects of digitalis compounds, dihydralazine and alpha-blockers are inconstant. Among the new treatments of heart failure, phosphodiesterase inhibitors may improve tolerance to stress, as does Corwin which may prolong the total duration of exercise. Its effect on oxygen consumption has not yet been evaluated. Performance at exercise is almost never improved by acute treatment with any pharmacological agent, and the same remarks applies to short-term heart transplantation. The reason for this is that heart failure is associated with a physical deconditioning syndrome due to abnormalities of the arterial dilatation capacity in skeletal muscles, and with muscular metabolic abnormalities due to a defective oxygen utilization by these muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "287": "Owing to its original pharmacokinetic profile, lisinopril can be taken once a day, independently of meals, providing a 24-hour inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. Lisinopril is a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Administered in doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day, it improves the functional and haemodynamic state of patients whose congestive heart failure is refractory to the digitalis-diuretic treatment. The drug is well tolerated, and no severe side-effects have been reported. Lisinopril seems to be at least as effective as captopril in congestive heart failure, and it has over the latter the advantage of a once a day dosage therapy.", 
    "288": "Several clinical investigations have suggested that captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) currently used as an anti-hypertensive agent, exhibits antidepressant properties in humans. In the present study we evaluated the action of perindopril, another ACEI, and two of its metabolites, the di-acide form perindoprilat, which possesses ACE inhibitory properties, and BDM-4, an inactive metabolite, in the learned helplessness paradigm. In order to confirm a possible action of these drugs via dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibition, we also investigated two inactive analogues of perindopril and perindoprilat. Perindopril (0.06-8 mg/kg per day) and perindoprilat (0.25-8 mg/kg per day) induced a reversal of escape deficits. BMD-4 and two analogues failed to reverse helpless behavior. These results support the hypothesis that ACE inhibition is a key factor in the behavioral antidepressant-like activity of perindopril and perindoprilat.", 
    "289": "The pharmacokinetics of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are difficult to assess for several reasons. First, these compounds exert their influence by inhibiting an intermediary enzyme of a cascade of enzymatic events, whose rate-limiting enzyme (renin) is not directly affected by ACE inhibition. Second, renin and angiotensin I accumulate during ACE inhibition and a change in the dose of an ACE inhibitor could produce sudden shifts of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Third, components of the circulating renin system require the interaction of several organ systems and effector sites. Fourth, the kinetics of ACE inhibitors can be influenced by the organ systems responsible for drug absorption, metabolism and excretion, and the functional status of these systems can be affected by the heart failure process. Fifth, at least some portion of the cardiovascular effects of ACE inhibitors is influenced by the contributions of other systems whose physiologic effects may be of importance in some patients with congestive heart failure. Sixth, the potential impact of tissue-bound ACE is not yet fully understood. Finally, for appropriate drug dosing, the effects of aging on the heart failure process, the extent of renin system activity, and the disposition of ACE inhibitors need to be considered. Because of their complex pharmacokinetics, treatment with ACE inhibitors has been guided by their pharmacodynamic and clinical characteristics.", 
    "290": "This study enrolled 253 patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class IV) from 35 centers in Scandinavia, randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or enalapril, in addition to their usual treatment for heart failure. After an initial titration period, the daily doses of enalapril ranged from 2.5 to 40 mg. At the end of the trial, 46% of the placebo-treated patients and 61% of the enalapril-treated patients were alive (p = 0.003); the survival figures at 8 months after completion of the trial were 32 and 48%, respectively (p = 0.001); and 21 and 30%, respectively (p = 0.006) at the 2-year follow-up. In the placebo group, there was a significant positive association between mortality and baseline levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, angiotensin II, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide; no such association was found in the enalapril-treated patients. The results suggest that the effects of enalapril on mortality are related to a counteraction of the neuroendocrine activation in general and to the renin-angiotensin system in particular.", 
    "291": "The increased neuroendocrine activity in patients with congestive heart failure appears to be a generalized attempt to maintain blood pressure at the expense of reduced cardiac performance and salt and water retention. It is likely that baroreceptor dysfunction contributes to increased sympathetic nervous system activity in patients with congestive heart failure. The usual tonic inhibitory messages emanating from baro- and mechanoreceptors in the great vessels and heart fail to adjust sympathetic traffic from the brain to the periphery, leading to uninhibited sympathetic tone. Arginine vasopressin and plasma renin activity may be increased secondarily; however, plasma renin activity activation could also be induced by a low-salt diet and diuretic use. Preliminary baseline data indicate that patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) but no or very mild symptoms of heart failure have increased plasma levels of norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic factor and arginine vasopressin, while plasma renin activity is normal, suggesting that neuroendocrine activity contributes to the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure. Neurohormones such as angiotensin II may alter gene expression, leading to changes in the shape and size of the cell. Remodeling of the heart and blood vessels is associated with both heart failure and hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been demonstrated to retard or reverse the remodeling process under certain experimental conditions. Studies are currently under way to test this possibility in patients.", 
    "292": "The circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. It has recently been demonstrated that endogenous RAS exist in target tissues that are important in cardiovascular regulation. This article reviews the multiple effects of angiotensin II in target tissues, the evidence for the presence of functional tissue RAS and the data that suggest a role for these tissue RAS in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Activation of circulating neurohormones is predictive of worsened survival in heart failure; however, cardiac and renal tissue RAS activities are also increased in the compensated stage of heart failure, when plasma renin-angiotensin activity is normal. It is hypothesized that the plasma RAS maintains circulatory homeostasis during acute cardiac decompensation, while changes in tissue RAS contribute to homeostatic responses during chronic sustained cardiac impairment. This concept of different functions of circulating and tissue RAS in the pathophysiology of heart failure may have important pharmacologic implications.", 
    "293": "The four major diagnostic criteria for the syndrome of congestive heart failure are left ventricular dysfunction, exercise intolerance, pulmonary congestion or edema and ventricular arrhythmias. Activation of norepinephrine, angiotensin II, vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide may be a key factor in the vasoconstriction and increased impedance to left ventricular ejection in heart failure. Interventions that interfere with these vasoconstrictor mechanisms should have a salutary effect on left ventricular performance. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers and vasopressin antagonists has resulted in hemodynamic benefits, but it has been more difficult to demonstrate long-term clinical effectiveness. Reductions in mortality have been demonstrated in patients with heart failure treated with vasodilators and ACE inhibitors. Improvement in the quality of life and prolongation of life are the only two appropriate goals in the management of heart failure. Further understanding of the role of angiotensin II and its interference by ACE inhibition in the tissue processes of heart failure is needed.", 
    "294": "Some studies report that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) improves renal function in patients with congestive heart failure, whereas others report that renal deterioration is a frequent complication of treatment with ACE inhibitors. This article explores the mechanisms by which antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system improves kidney function in some patients while causing harm in others. ACE inhibition may alter renal blood flow, glomerular perfusion pressure, basement membrane activity and renal tubular function both directly and indirectly. In most patients, renal function is maintained as other neurohormonal mechanisms compensate for the negative effects and permit the positive effects (such as improved renal flow) to predominate. However, when physiologic characteristics or iatrogenic interventions (such as volume reduction or prostaglandin inhibition) limit the effectiveness of neurohormonal compensation to maintain renal autoregulation, clinically important deterioration in renal function may occur. An understanding of the renal effects of ACE inhibitors permits their safe and effective use in most patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "295": "1. Effects of single doses of captopril (12.5, 25 and 50 mg) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and on body sway were studied in fourteen healthy male subjects. Oxazepam (15 mg), as an active control, and two placebos were included in the study, together with a single dose of atenolol (100 mg). Medication was administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and assessments made before and at 2 and 4 h after drug ingestion. 2. There were no changes in the EEG with captopril. Oxazepam reduced the circadian rise in alpha activity, while atenolol decreased beta power. Delta activity was modified by both oxazepam and atenolol. 3. A reduction in lower frequencies of body sway (0.05-1 Hz) occurred with captopril, while the spectra were unaffected by oxazepam. Atenolol increased (P less than 0.05) activity in the frequency range 0.75-2.75 Hz. 4. These observations suggest that captopril is free of central effects such as sedation that may occur with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Reduced body sway with captopril could reflect improved integration of central and peripheral control of posture.", 
    "296": "1. Central effects of single doses of captopril (12.5, 25 and 50 mg) were studied in fourteen healthy male subjects. Two placebos and an active control drug, oxazepam (15 mg), were included, together with a single dose of atenolol (100 mg). The drugs were administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and performance and subjective feelings were assessed before and from 1.5-2.5 h and 3.5-4.5 h after ingestion. 2. Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, together with critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. 3. Captopril did not impair performance on any of the tests, but improved short-term memory (P less than 0.05) and increased the number of letters cancelled (P less than 0.05). Oxazepam reduced the number of substitutions completed in the digit symbol test (P less than 0.01), accuracy on continuous attention (P less than 0.05), number of letters cancelled (P less than 0.05), and rate of finger tapping (P less than 0.05), and increased choice reaction time (P less than 0.001). Atenolol reduced the rate of finger tapping (P less than 0.05), but increased the number of letters cancelled (P less than 0.05). 4. No effects on mood or on subjective feelings were evident with captopril. Oxazepam reduced subjective alertness (P less than 0.05), and atenolol increased feelings of sleepiness (P less than 0.05). 5. Although these observations suggest that central effects may exist with captopril, no adverse consequences have been established on performance or on subjective assessment of mood. Captopril may, therefore, be an appropriate drug for hypertensive patients engaged in skilled activity.", 
    "297": "The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), CGS 14831 (CAS 86541-78-8) and captopril, on the mechanical function and energy metabolism were studied in isolated rat hearts using global ischemia-reperfusion model. The myocardial tissue levels of ATP, creatine phosphate (CP) and pH were determined with 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR). Global ischemia was induced by cross-clamping of the inflow line for 40 min. While thiol containing ACEI, captopril, significantly inhibited the ATP depletion and pH fall produced by ischemia, non-thiol compound, CGS 14831, did not have any influence on the ATP degradation and pH fall during ischemia. Both CGS 14831 (20 micrograms/ml) and captopril (80 micrograms/ml) have little influence on the mechanical function during the ischemia-reperfusion period. L-Cysteine (44.6 micrograms/ml) inhibited the pH fall significantly during the ischemia without exerting influence on the ATP degradation. These data suggest that local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system does not play an important role in maintenance of the myocardial mechanical function during ischemia-reperfusion. The thiol residue of captopril is not responsible for the inhibitory effect of this compound on ischemia-induced ATP degradation. Some specific effect of captopril may play a role in the protective effect.", 
    "298": "The captopril test was used to make a differential diagnosis of various types of primary aldosteronism. After captopril, there was no change in the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system only in the group of patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas in a histological variant of \"adenoma and atrophy\". The findings suggest that aldosterone secretion regulation is autonomic in the adenoma unassociated with the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system only in the case of isolated adenoma with a histological variant of adenoma and atrophy. In patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas in the presence of the variant \"adenoma and hyperplasia\", aldosterone secretion retains sensitivity to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as in patients with idiopathic hyperplasia and hypertensive disease, which indicates that it is possible to differentiate isolated \"adenoma and atrophy\" from hypertensive disease and idiopathic hyperplasia, despite its combination with tumor by using the captopril test.", 
    "299": "Perindopril is a non-sulphydryl, pro-drug, ACE inhibitor. Following oral dosing, peak concentrations of the active moiety, perindoprilat, are achieved after 2-3 hours and perindoprilat is barely detectable by 24 hours. In contrast, maximal ACE inhibition is observed 4-6 hours after oral dosing and substantial inhibition persists beyond 24 hours. Inhibition of ACE is dose-dependent over the range 1-16 mg perindopril orally, and is mirrored by elevation of plasma renin activity and falls in aldosterone concentrations. Blood pressure reductions have been confirmed in normotensive and hypertensive subjects with maximal effect 6-10 hours after dosing and adequate antihypertensive activity at 24 hours. Blood pressure reductions are greater in the elderly than in young subjects due to pharmacokinetic differences. Dose reduction is required in elderly subjects and those with renal impairment. The antihypertensive efficacy of perindopril 4-8 mg once daily, is comparable to that of atenolol 50-100 mg once daily, captopril 25-50 mg twice daily or a hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride combination. Reduction in heart failure severity has also been reported. Perindopril appears to be a safe and effective agent for use in hypertension.", 
    "300": "Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) shifts the limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation towards lower blood pressure values. In patients with chronic arterial hypertension and in patients with chronic heart failure cerebral blood flow is not changed by acute or chronic ACE inhibition, despite, in some cases, pronounced reductions in the mean arterial blood pressure. ACE inhibition does not change ischaemic regional cerebral blood flow in acute stroke. It is concluded that following ACE inhibition cerebral blood flow is maintained at an unchanged level and especially well maintained in case of blood pressure drop.", 
    "301": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are becoming increasingly used in the treatment of hypertension. Although they are generally well tolerated, they have been implicated in the occurrence of certain side effects such as cough, hypotension and deterioration of renal function. These have been investigated prospectively during the development of perindopril. In a long term study in 632 hypertensive patients 6% of subjects stopped treatment prematurely because of adverse events and cough was the side effect most frequently responsible for treatment withdrawal (1.3%). A typical ACE inhibitor-induced cough was seen in a further 1.6% of patients. Symptomatic hypotension was rarely reported (0.2%), even in the elderly and patients with congestive heart failure. No clinically significant changes in plasma creatinine or potassium levels were seen during the long-term administration of perindopril in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. The overall safety profile of perindopril in clinical studies was favourable even in groups of more vulnerable patients. However the effect of long-term treatment with ACe inhibitors on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is unknown.", 
    "302": "Blood pressure, forearm arterial haemodynamics and echocardiographic parameters were studied in patients with sustained essential hypertension before and after administration of the ACE inhibitor, perindopril. In a single blind study versus placebo, perindopril significantly reduced BP and at the same time increased brachial artery diameter, blood flow and compliance. As part of the haemodynamic investigation, a 5 minute wrist occlusion was performed. During this period, blood flow velocity and arterial diameter decreased but the reduction in diameter was smaller with perindopril after one year's treatment showing an increase in brachial artery diameter. This result indicates that the increase in brachial arterial diameter following perindopril could not be explained solely on the basis of a flow dependent dilation. When perindopril was withdrawn after three months of treatment and replaced by placebo for four weeks, BP and forearm arterial haemodynamics returned towards baseline values. However, cardiac mass which was significantly decreased after perindopril remained decreased four weeks after cessation of treatment. In the seven normalised patients, perindopril was continued for one year; arterial compliance remained increased and cardia mass diminished. The study showed that the arterial changes caused by perindopril involved a drug-related relaxation of arterial smooth muscle and that there was a differential response in cardiac and arterial changes following long term treatment.", 
    "303": "A blood pressure recording is strictly speaking only relevant for the circumstances under which it is measured. There is increasing evidence that ambulatory recordings have more predictive power than casual BP recordings and are a better discriminator between high and low risk groups of patients, particularly within the category of mild hypertension. Increasing use is being made of 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring as a means of assessing hypotensive therapy. The effects of monotherapy with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (8 mg once daily) on 24 hour ambulatory intra-arterial BP demonstrated that after six weeks' treatment there is a significant reduction in ambulatory BP, as compared with the placebo period, without any associated reflex tachycardia. We conclude that perindopril is an effective anti-hypertensive agent reducing BP throughout the 24 hour period.", 
    "304": "ACE inhibitors have antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of thiazides, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. They are simple to prescribe and to take, and are relatively free from subjective side-effects apart from persistent dry cough. There are few specific concerns about safety, but experience of long-term use is still relatively limited. They are valuable additional or alternative antihypertensive drugs when standard therapy is contraindicated or fails to control blood pressure.", 
    "305": "We compared the effects of sustained-release diltiazem and captopril on blood pressure control and lipid profile. Forty-eight patients with primary hypertension were included in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study and 43 completed the trial. Following a two-to four-week placebo run-in period, each patient initially received either diltiazem (60-180 mg twice daily) or captopril (25-75 mg twice daily) for 16 weeks and then crossed over to the other drug after an interim placebo washout period. Both drugs significantly reduced systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DPB) blood pressure compared to baseline. However, supine (P less than 0.01), sitting and standing (P less than 0.05) DPB was lower with diltiazem than with captopril. Moreover, BP control (sitting DBP less than 90 mmHg) was achieved in a greater proportion of patients treated with diltiazem (63 vs 44%). Heart rate was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) with diltiazem in all positions but was unchanged with captopril. Lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations were not modified with either treatment. We conclude that both diltiazem and captopril are effective antihypertensive agents without deleterious effects on lipid metabolism. However diltiazem provides a better prolonged control of BP and may offer some advantages for patients in whom a slower heart rate would be beneficial.", 
    "306": "A multicentre randomised double-blind trial was performed in order to compare the therapeutic efficacy and acceptability of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril with those of atenolol in mild to moderate hypertension. After one month of placebo, 173 patients with supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 125 mmHg were randomised to receive perindopril 4 mg once daily or atenolol 50 mg once daily. Monthly assessments were made for three months. Treatment was adjusted at these visits if supine DBP was greater than 90 mmHg; the dose was first doubled (8 mg perindopril or 100 mg atenolol once daily) and then hydrochlorothiazide was added. The pretreatment blood pressure levels were similar in both groups. Supine DBP was 105.5 +/- 0.9 mmHg (n = 85) in the perindopril group and 106.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg (n = 88) in the atenolol group. At the end of the third month, the study target blood pressure (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg) was achieved in a significantly (P = 0.006) larger percentage of patients in the perindopril group (78%) than in the atenolol group (58%). This appeared to be due to a greater potentiation of the antihypertensive effect by the addition of diuretic to perindopril than to atenolol. The fall in systolic blood pressure was significantly greater in the perindopril group than in the atenolol group (supine: 26.5 +/- 2.0 mmHg vs. 20.6 +/- 2.0 mmHg; P = 0.042) although the fall in DBP was comparable (supine: perindopril 17.4 +/- 0.9 mmHg, atenolol 15.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg; P = 0.195).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "307": "In a cohort of 136 hypertensive patients started consecutively on enalapril the incidence of persistent dry cough by life-table analysis was 14.6% (95% CI 10.2-19.0%). The incidence in women (19.2%; 95% CI 11.3-27.1%) was twice that in men (9.7%; 95% CI 6.6-12.8%). Dry cough was unrelated to age, smoking habit, renal function, or the dose and duration of enalapril treatment. In one half of patients who developed cough enalapril had to be stopped. The incidence of withdrawal due to cough was 6.0% (95% CI 4.5-7.5%), and cough was by far the most common reason for discontinuing enalapril treatment. Reviewing previous studies of enalapril-induced cough, it is evident that postmarketing surveillance studies have grossly underestimated the incidence and importance of this side-effect. Surveys in hospital clinics have slightly underestimated the true incidence through failure to use life-table methods of analysis.", 
    "308": "We studied the effects of perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor administered during 12 months, on creatinine clearance, albuminuria and glycaemic control in diabetic subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. After 1 month placebo, 40 insulin-treated patients were divided into 3 groups based upon their urinary albumin excretion rate. Group 1 had a normoalbuminuria (less than 15 mg/24 h), group II had a microalbuminuria (15-150 mg/24 h) and group III had a macroproteinuria (greater than 150 mg/24 h and Albustix +). They were given perindopril 4 to 8 mg orally once daily, and received a stable diet. Diastolic blood pressure was normalized within the first 3 months in 80% of the patients. From these, 28 (14.7 and 7 from groups I, II and III respectively) were followed during a total active treatment period of 12 months. They were matched for age, duration of diabetes and hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, daily insulin dose, postprandial plasma C-peptide and quality of glycaemic control. Mean supine diastolic blood pressure was decreased by 15 and 18% at 1 and 12 months respectively. Heart rate was not significantly modified. At 3 months, plasma ACE activity was nearly totally inhibited while plasma renin activity was markedly increased. In patients of group II, microalbuminuria was reduced from 66 +/- 13 (mean +/- SEM after placebo) to 39 +/- 6 mg/24 h after 1 month perindopril and this effect was maintained at 12 months. In group I, albuminuria remained within the normal range. In group III, macroproteinuria was not consistently modified by perindopril. Creatinine clearance did not change and glycaemic control remained stable throughout the study in the 3 groups. No major side effects were observed. We conclude that perindopril normalizes blood pressure in a large majority of hypertensive diabetic patients without affecting the quality of diabetes control. It also induces a marked and sustained reduction of microalbuminuria in patients at risk of developing diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "309": "The ultraviolet and circular dichroism spectra of authentic captopril have been obtained, since the reported literature data are inconsistent with those obtained on highly purified material. The UV absorption spectrum consists of a single band maximum at 200 nm, while the CD spectrum consists of a single negative peak located at 210 nm. The CD spectrum of captopril and its other three diastereomers can be explained largely in terms of a summation of the chirality of its individual components, (S)-proline and (2S)-3-mercapto-2-methylpropionic acid.", 
    "310": "The effect of exogenously administered vasopressin was observed on captopril induced vasodilatation in hindquarters of anaesthetised rats. Drops of perfusate were counted for 6 min and mean of the outflow was expressed as drops per min (dpm). In the control group (n = 6) the rate of flow was 9.5 +/- 1.04 dpm which increased to 12.33 +/- 1.36 dpm following captopril (200 micrograms/ml) infusion. In test group (n = 6) pretreated with vasopressin (4 I.U./kg 1 hr before) the rate of flow was 9.16 +/- 0.98 dpm which was reduced to 5.5 +/- 1.04 dpm following infusion with captopril. It is concluded that vasopressin reverses the vasodilatory effect of captopril.", 
    "311": "Apart from their established use in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, ACE inhibitors have been suggested to exert anti-ischemic effects. This article reviews the mechanisms of systemic and intracardiac angiotensin formation, as well as its interaction with the bradykinin, the prostaglandin, and the sympathetic nervous system. While high doses of angiotensin can precipitate myocardial ischemia. experimental data on a potential beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on ischemic myocardial blood flow and function are inconsistent and controversial. Pooling the few available clinical data, several ACE inhibitors may attenuate myocardial ischemia at rest and during exercise. However, a significant fraction of patients does not benefit or even deteriorates. Recent experimental studies suggest a beneficial role of ACE inhibitors in attenuating reperfusion arrhythmias and postinfarction left ventricular remodeling. Unless the mechanisms and determinants of potential anti-ischemic actions of ACE inhibitors can be better defined, their use for treatment of myocardial ischemia cannot be recommended at present.", 
    "312": "Renal complications of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy are widely recognized, but few authors have documented the incidence or spectrum of these conditions. In a retrospective study of 530 consecutive patients presenting to our unit as acute uraemic emergencies over a six-year period, 85 (16 per cent) had renovascular disease that was considered to be responsible for their loss of renal function. Twenty-one (4 per cent) patients had uraemia which could be clearly attributable to ACE inhibitor treatment; 18 of these cases were shown to have significant renovascular pathology. Following withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor the renal failure reversed in the majority of patients. We also examined 400 consecutive hypertensive patients referred over a similar period and, although vascular imaging was performed only when it was considered to be clinically indicated, 58 (14.5 per cent) of these patients were shown to have renovascular pathology. A further five patients with stable chronic renal disease were seen to have a deterioration in their glomerular filtration rate coincident with commencement of ACE inhibitor therapy; this reversed when the agents were withdrawn. These observations indicate that significant renovascular disease may be more common than has been hitherto recognized and that injudicious use of ACE inhibitors may result in serious complications. Methods which may minimize such iatrogenic disease are suggested.", 
    "313": "Hypertension frequently coexists with hyperlipidaemia and it has been suggested that the potential benefits of blood pressure reduction may be compromised if lipid levels are not concurrently reduced. In addition, conventional first line antihypertensive drugs (thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers) produce adverse changes in blood lipids which are most apparent in the short-term but do not entirely disappear during chronic treatment. Of the alternative first-line antihypertensive agents, the calcium antagonist and ACE inhibitor drugs are lipid 'neutral' but only the alpha 1-blockers have been associated with favourable effects on the lipid profile.", 
    "314": "A single blind, placebo controlled, dose-ranging 3 month study of the effects of enalapril on cardiovascular parameters, clinical status and self-paced exercise capacity was undertaken in 12 Nigerians with chronic heart failure. Enalapril exerted only a modest reduction in blood pressure and heart rate but significantly improved functional capacity (P less than 0.01), and prolonged self-paced exercise time (P less than 0.05) compared to the placebo baseline. The pressure rate product and the double product corrected for exercise time, an index of myocardial oxygen demand, exhibited a significant and sustained reduction on enalapril treatment (P less than 0.01). Concentration of sodium in the serum was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) but concentrations of potassium and creatinine were unaltered. These results demonstrate the sustained efficacy of enalapril in black Africans with heart failure and indicate no important racial difference in the response to inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme in congestive heart failure.", 
    "315": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system usually occurs during hemodialysis and in hemodialyzed normal dogs parallels reductions in blood flow to a tissue group that is largely composed of skeletal muscle. To determine if excessive activation of this system might cause dialysis-associated skeletal muscle cramps in some patients, we conducted a double-blind, randomized and balanced trial in which 5 patients with frequent dialysis-associated cramps were each given either a 25 mg oral dose of captopril or placebo 1 h before 8 consecutive dialyses. Captopril increased the frequency of dialyses complicated by skeletal muscle cramps in 1 patient and did not affect cramp frequency in the other 4 patients. Predialysis plasma renin activity (PRA) averaged 3.9 ng/ml/h (+/- SD) and was the same as in unselected hemodialysis patients. Following captopril, PRA increased by an average of 2.2 +/- 0.7 times, similar to the 2.6-fold increase that was reported when this drug was used to prevent dialysis-associated hypertensive crises. However, hemodialysis by itself did not activate the renin-angiotensin system as consistently in patients with frequent dialysis-associated skeletal muscle cramps as in unselected hemodialysis patients and the ratio of post- to predialysis PRA averaged 1.0 +/- 0.6. We conclude that the renin-angiotensin system does not mediate, and that its activation during hemodialysis may actually help prevent, dialysis-associated skeletal muscle cramps.", 
    "316": "It has been suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors halt the progression of chronic renal failure. During the first months of a controlled trial of this hypothesis a fall in haemoglobin (Hb) was observed in patients treated with the ACE inhibitor enalapril. It was investigated whether this was related to changes in serum erythropoietin (EPO). Data were analysed in 59 consecutive patients during an observation period of 90 days. In enalapril-treated patients (n = 27) Hb fell gradually from a median value of 7.6 to 6.7 mmol/l at 90 days of treatment. In the control group of patients on conventional antihypertensive treatment (n = 32) median Hb was unchanged (7.6 mmol/l) throughout the observation period (p less than 0.001 enalapril vs control). In the enalapril-treated group median EPO concentration fell from 32 to 24 U/l at 90 days of treatment, whereas in conventionally treated patients median EPO was 34 U/l and 35 U/l, respectively (p less than 0.05 enalapril vs control). Neither glomerular filtration rate nor arterial blood pressure differed significantly in the two groups. Furthermore, there were no signs of bone marrow suppression, increased haemolysis or change in plasma volume. In conclusion, a decrease in Hb was found after start of treatment with enalapril in patients with progressive chronic renal failure, possibly caused by a suppression of EPO production.", 
    "317": "Angiotensin receptors in the most ventral part of the ventral median preoptic nucleus (VVMnPO) or organum vasculosum laminae terminalis appear to be important for salt appetite to angiotensin in rats. If so, then small lesions of this region should reduce salt appetite that is dependent on angiotensin. In separate experiments, the lesion greatly reduced salt appetite after treatments with chronic oral captopril or sodium depletion. On the other hand, the VVMnPO lesion actually enhanced salt appetite to deoxycorticosterone acetate. The lesion did not affect water intake to water deprivation, combined food-water deprivation, isoproterenol, or hypertonic saline, and basal plasma osmolality and sodium values were normal. These experiments suggest that VVMnPO lesions selectively affect angiotensin-induced salt appetite without producing the gross hydrational deficits that occur with larger lesions of the ventral forebrain.", 
    "318": "The syndrome of congestive heart failure can result from a variety of cardiac disorders of which left ventricular dysfunction is the most common. The clinical presentation is determined by the interaction between cardiac dysfunction and a series of compensatory mechanisms that are activated throughout the body. Therapy for this disorder is best approached through an understanding of this complex relationship and an appreciation for the influence of preload, afterload, and contractility on cardiac performance. Recent important advances in therapy include the use of combined diuretic therapy, a better understanding of the value of the digitalis glycosides, and evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can relieve symptoms and prolong life. More intensive therapy earlier in the course of congestive heart failure appears to have some clinical benefit. The use of ACE inhibitors during this phase may delay progression of the underlying left ventricular dysfunction. Future therapy will be influenced by the results of ongoing trials that are testing both new agents and expanded indications for drugs that are currently available.", 
    "319": "The pharmacokinetics of quinapril and its active metabolite, quinaprilat, were evaluated in 12 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on chronic hemodialysis. Each subject received a single 20-mg oral dose of quinapril 4 hours before a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment. Serial dialysate and blood samples were obtained over 4 and 96 hours, respectively. Samples were analyzed for quinapril and quinaprilat concentrations by gas chromatography. Mean tmax and Cmax values for quinapril were 1.2 hours and 129 ng/mL, respectively. Only one patient had detectable quinapril dialysate concentrations which accounted for 2.8% of the quinapril dose. Mean apparent plasma clearance for quinapril was 1275 mL/min with a mean half-life of 1.7 hours. Quinapril was extensively de-esterified to its diacid metabolite, quinaprilat. Mean tmax and Cmax for quinaprilat were 4.5 hours and 671 ng/mL, respectively. Mean apparent plasma clearance for quinaprilat was 24.0 mL/min with a mean half-life of 17.5 hours. As with quinapril, quinaprilat was not readily dialyzable. Only 5.4% of the administered quinapril dose was recovered as quinaprilat during a single hemodialysis treatment. In view of these results, supplemental quinapril doses need not be routinely given to patients following hemodialysis. Overall, quinapril and quinaprilat pharmacokinetics in patients with ESRD on chronic hemodialysis were not markedly different from those previously observed in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (CLcr less than 29 mL/min) not yet requiring hemodialysis (RDND).", 
    "320": "The cardioselective beta-blocker atenolol and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared for efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life factors in 30 patients with hypertension whose hypertension was inadequately controlled with diuretic alone. Atenolol (50 to 100 mg once a day) and enalapril (2.5 to 40 mg once a day), combined with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once a day), had similar levels of efficacy and safety. A comprehensive battery of psychologic assessments for quality of life was administered, including measures of anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, memory, and psychomotor function. These five conceptually based clusters were first analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance procedures, followed by univariate analyses of the individual variables composing each domain. In general, neither atenolol nor enalapril was associated with major changes in psychologic functioning. The only data cluster with a statistically significant change was memory function, primarily as a result of lower scores of the digit span (backward) test, for atenolol relative to enalapril. These preliminary findings suggest that atenolol and enalapril have comparable degrees of efficacy and safety, with no major disparities in quality-of-life effects, for hypertensive patients with a history of taking diuretics and this sort of quality-of-life assessment can be performed during trials of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "321": "The effect of intravenous captopril was studied in 24 white patients who had moderate to severe hypertension. Patients received incremental doses of 1 to 10 mg delivered at 10 min intervals over 50 to 80 min. Blood pressure (BP) was lowered within 5 to 10 min after the initial dose was administered and continued to decline, reaching a maximum response after 20 min (2 to 4 mg). At this time group mean BP fell from 175 +/- 3/111 +/- 1 to 166 +/- 3/97 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Additional dose increments to an average cumulative dose of 40 mg did not increase the initial effect. No adverse side effects or symptomatic hypotension occurred in any subject. There was a significant correlation between diastolic BP decreases observed in response to intravenous captopril and subsequent long-term oral captopril therapy. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide increased the proportion of patients reaching normotension. We conclude that small intravenous bolus injections of captopril appear to be effective rapidly and are well tolerated in moderate to severe essential hypertension. Short-term intravenous administration seems to predict the response to chronic oral captopril therapy.", 
    "322": "High-dose firosemide is considered effective in primary renal sodium retention but is not generally recommended in congestive heart failure. In order to evaluate efficacy and safety of high-dose furosemide (greater than 500 mg/day), the authors studied 20 patients (pts) resistant to therapy (including furosemide less than 500 mg/day) selected from 161 pts admitted for chronic heart failure. All refractory pts (15 men and 5 women, mean age sixty +/- 12 years) were in NYHA class IV and showed hyponatremia (130 +/- 5 mEq/L) and impaired renal function (BUN 31 +/- 14 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.3 +/- 0.3 mg/dL and BUN/creatinine ratio 23 +/- 7). In addition to digitalis, dopamine, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or vasodilators, IV high-dose furosemide (775 +/- 419 mg/day, 500-2000) was given for ten +/- five days under daily clinical and laboratory monitoring. Three pts died of low-output syndrome while 16 pts were upgraded to NYHA class III and 1 pt to class II; a mean weight reduction of 7.3 +/- 2.9 kg in ten + five days (0.80 +/- 0.4 kg/day) and a mean diuresis increase of 88 +/- 57% occurred. The maximal dose of furosemide did not correlate with serum creatinine but did correlate with BUN/creatinine ratio (r = 0.78, p less than .001). Pts were discharged on with chronic heart failure, and 43% in the subgroup in NYHA class IV with hyponatremia. High dose furosemide was effective for rapid removal of excess water and salt in \"furosemide-resistant\" congestive heart failure. The relationship between renal impairment and maximal furosemide doses seems to confirm the role of renal pharmacokinetics in the appearance of furosemide resistance.", 
    "323": "The role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in Na-depletion-induced Na appetite of mice was investigated. Intraperitoneal injection of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril at 1.7 mg/mouse (high dose) decreased the Na intake of the Na-depleted (furosemide-treated) mice by 80-85%. The decrease in Na intake was restored to the initial level by concurrent subcutaneous infusion of ANG II. High dose of captopril also decreased the Na intake of fluid-deprived, Na-depleted mice. High dose of captopril did not alter water intake in any of the four conditions examined, i.e., in fluid-replete, Na-depleted, water-deprived, or fluid-deprived, Na-depleted mice. Low dose of captopril (1.7 microgram/mouse) tended to or significantly enhanced Na intake of Na-depleted mice. Low dose of captopril, however, did not enhance water intake in any of the conditions examined. Both high- and low-dose captopril treatment decreased food intake in water-deprived mice, whether or not the mice were Na depleted as well. The addition of captopril (0.1 or 1.0 mg/ml) to the drinking water did not influence Na or food intake. Water intake was enhanced during treatment with the low but not with the high dose of captopril. The results are consistent with the proposition that ANG II is involved in the Na appetite of Na-depleted mice. ANG II does not appear to have a role in water intake of Na-depleted or water-deprived mice, but neural mechanisms in which angiotensin has a role may influence food intake of water-deprived mice.", 
    "324": "To define whether angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition affects the distribution of renin gene-expressing cells within the kidney, a control group of adult male Wistar-Kyoto rats (C, n = 7) was compared with a group of rats treated with enalapril (E, n = 6) for 5 days. Renin mRNA distribution was assessed using in situ hybridization to a 35S-labeled 28 mer oligonucleotide complementary to rat renin mRNA. Whereas in control rats renin mRNA was confined to a juxtaglomerular location, in enalapril-treated rats, renin mRNA extended proximally along the length of the afferent arteriole. The percent of visible afferent arteriolar length containing renin mRNA was higher in enalapril-treated (71.7 +/- 2.8%) than in control (49.6 +/- 2.1%) rats (P less than 0.0001). These findings were accompanied by an increase in the percent of juxtaglomerular apparatuses (JGAs) containing renin mRNA (71 +/- 2.2 vs. 49 +/- 2.9%; E vs. C, P less than 0.0001). Also, the intensity of the JGA hybridization signals was higher in enalapril-treated (757 +/- 59 grains/JGA) than in control (167 +/- 11 grains/JGA) rats (P less than 0.00001). We conclude that the increased kidney renin gene expression elicited by ACE inhibition is the result of an increase in renin mRNA content per JGA, an increase in the number of JGAs expressing the renin gene, and a recruitment of renin gene-expressing cells along the afferent arteriole.", 
    "325": "Male Munich-Wistar rats underwent right nephrectomy and were given weekly injections of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and 1% saline (salt) to drink. Two studies were performed. In the first, rats given enalapril (ENP) were compared with controls. In the second, rats ingested either standard chow or chow to which the calcium-entry blocker nifedipine (NIF) had been added. Six to eight weeks after nephrectomy, both control DOCA-salt rats and those given ENP had severe hypertension and significant proteinuria. Rats given NIF excreted less protein, and glomerular lesions were not observed in this group. The effects of NIF on several parameters that have been associated with glomerular injury were examined. Micropuncture studies revealed that glomerular capillary pressure was increased in DOCA-salt rats and was not reduced by NIF. Platelet aggregation was also similar in NIF-treated and control rats. Morphometric studies revealed a tendency toward lower glomerular volume of NIF-treated rats; however, kidney weight and glomerular capillary radius were unaffected by therapy. Thus NIF, but not ENP, prevents DOCA-salt rats from developing hypertension and glomerular injury. This effect does not depend on reduction in glomerular pressure or inhibition of platelet aggregation.", 
    "326": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are chronic medical conditions that frequently coexist. In the United States, it is estimated that 10 million persons suffer from diabetes mellitus, 60 million from hypertension, and 3 million from the combination of the two. There may be a causal relationship between hypertension and diabetes. Obesity may be a precipitating factor for both hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus generally become hypertensive only with the onset of nephropathy. Glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia frequently occur with essential hypertension and may be aggravated by hypertension therapy, especially with diuretics and beta-blockers. Hyperinsulinemia may be an important common factor promoting sodium retention, sympathetic nervous system stimulation, and inhibition of the sodium pump. The Working Group on Hypertension in Diabetes has outlined a flexible modified version of the stepped-care approach to the treatment of hypertension in diabetes. Management is complex because diabetes is associated with autonomic neuropathy, sexual dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, and fluid and electrolyte disorders. All these problems can be exacerbated by antihypertensive treatment. Nonpharmacologic measures, which address weight reduction and sodium restriction, are logical, but aggressive antihypertensive medication is invariably necessary. Diuretics and/or beta-blockers were the mainstay of treatment until the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. These newer agents have no deleterious effects on carbohydrate metabolism and are generally better tolerated. Antihypertensive therapy may slow the rate of deterioration in diabetic nephropathy. This was first shown with diuretics, beta-blockers, and hydralazine and more recently with ACE inhibitors, which provide effective blood pressure control and a significant drop in albuminuria without affecting the glomerular filtration rate adversely. ACE inhibition may also lead to increased insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal rate. Long-term trials are needed to assess the effects of these new agents on the treatment of hypertension in the diabetic population.", 
    "327": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are two classes of antihypertensive agents with novel effects on renal function. In both experimental and clinical studies, calcium channel blockers tend to increase renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary sodium excretion in essential hypertension. ACE inhibitors have similar effects on renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in essential hypertension, but they tend to cause sodium retention. ACE inhibitors can cause marked reductions in glomerular filtration rate in renovascular hypertension, making them a problematic choice for the treatment of this form of hypertension. In chronic, progressive renal diseases, ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease protein excretion and morphologic evidence of glomerulosclerosis. The relationship of the decrease in protein excretion to the progression of renal disease has not yet been established.", 
    "328": "Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be nephrotoxic and may synergistically compromise renal function. A computer-assisted study was done to asses the prevalence of compromised renal function and the clinical importance of this drug interaction. A search of the records of all patients seen in the University of Nebraska Medical Center Internal Medicine Clinic was conducted to identify cases involving renal insufficiency, therapy with ACE inhibitors, or therapy with NSAIDs. Records of cases meeting these criteria were reviewed for clinical correlation and revealed 2278 patients treated with NSAIDs, 328 with ACE inhibitors, and 162 with both. No nephrotoxicity was found in conjunction with monotherapy, but three cases of reversible renal failure were found in conjunction with combination therapy. Significant nephrotoxicity during the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs is not uncommon, and attention should be drawn to this potentially important interaction.", 
    "329": "The effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) and captopril on functional capacity, hemodynamics and survival were studied in 154 rats that recovered after experimental myocardial infarction. Rats were randomized into four groups receiving either CoQ, captopril, a combination of the two drugs or 1 ml of tap water once daily for 12 weeks from the day of coronary artery ligation. CoQ as well as captopril and the combined treatment significantly improved exercise capacity as evaluated by lactate production during a standardized treadmill exercise test. No significant changes in heart rate or mean blood pressure were observed during the study in the captopril-treated group. CoQ treatment increased the maximum heart rate significantly, whereas no effect on mean blood pressure was observed. Both captopril and CoQ decreased pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, the data may suggest that captopril prevents right ventricular hypertrophy seen in placebo-treated rats with large infarcts. This was not observed after CoQ treatment. Captopril treatment improved 3-month probability of survival (93%) as compared with placebo (74%) (P less than .05). CoQ and the combined treatment tended to improve survival, but this was, however, not statistically significant.", 
    "330": "In order to determine the possible role of prostaglandins in the abnormal cough reflex in patients with dry cough, the effects of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor on cough symptoms were examined. This was measured by a cough symptom score and by the cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin in a double blind, randomized, cross-over study comparing the effects of placebo with sulindac, 200 mg daily for 1 week. We studied six hypertensive patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-associated cough and six patients with an idiopathic, dry, unproductive cough, all of whom had an increase in the sensitivity of the cough reflex. There was no change in blood pressure control in the hypertensive patients during sulindac therapy. The patients with the angiotensin converting enzyme-associated cough had a significant reduction in the cough symptom score and also a significant increase in the dose of capsaicin causing two or more coughs (threshold sensitivity) and that causing five or more coughs (near maximum response) during sulindac therapy as compared to placebo. In those patients with idiopathic, dry, unproductive cough, sulindac did not alter the symptom of cough or the cough reflex response to capsaicin. These results suggest that prostaglandins may be involved in cough associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, but are less likely to be important in the pathogenesis of more common dry coughs of unknown cause.", 
    "331": "Captopril decreases protein excretion in patients with nephrosis. To evaluate whether captopril has an acute antiproteinuric effect and to evaluate the role of changes in renal hemodynamics or glomerular permselectivity on this effect, renal clearance studies were performed in patients without diabetes but with nephrosis. Protein excretion and renal hemodynamics were measured at baseline and after the administration of captopril. To measure the contribution of renal prostaglandins, patients were restudied on a separate day, after the combined administration of captopril and the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor ibuprofen. Both treatments significantly reduced mean protein excretion, but the change was greater with combined therapy than with captopril alone (40.6% vs 20.0%). Mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased by 4.8% (not significant) and 16.5% (p less than 0.001), and filtration fraction (FF) decreased by 13.6% (p less than 0.001) and 14.9% (p less than 0.001) after captopril alone and combined therapy, respectively. No significant correlation was found between changes in proteinuria and changes in GFR or FF after treatment with captopril alone. In contrast, the decrease in proteinuria correlated with the change in GFR after combined drug administration (r = 0.68, p = 0.06). The ratio of immunoglobulin G to albumin clearance, an index of glomerular permselectivity, was unaffected by captopril but decreased significantly (by 43%) after combined drug administration. The results suggest that the acute antiproteinuric effect of captopril is not due to changes in FF, GFR, or glomerular perselectivity. The addition of ibuprofen enhances the antiproteinuric effect of captopril by decreasing the GFR as well as by enhancing the permselectivity of the glomerular capillary membrane.", 
    "332": "The early (after 21 days) and late (after 4 months) effects of continuous treatment with captopril on left ventricular performance, weight and volumes were studied in rats with myocardial infarction. Early effects were examined in rats subjected to coronary ligation and randomized to either immediate treatment with captopril (2 g/liter drinking water) starting 2 h after surgery or no treatment. After 21 days, the treated group showed reductions in mean arterial, left ventricular systolic and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures compared with untreated rats. Right and left ventricular weight and left ventricular volumes were decreased and the ejection fraction index was increased by captopril treatment. To study the late effects of captopril, a second group of rats was randomized to immediate captopril treatment (starting 2 h after surgery), delayed captopril treatment (starting 21 days after surgery) or no treatment. When studied after 4 months of treatment, rats started on captopril treatment 2 h after infarction showed no differences compared with rats started on treatment 21 days after infarction. Treatment with captopril for 4 months produced changes that were similar to those in rats treated for 21 days. Captopril treatment improved hemodynamic function after myocardial infarction in rats examined after either 21 days or 4 months of treatment. The extent of the benefit was similar in the two treatment periods. Initiation of captopril therapy immediately after infarction did not appear to produce a greater effect than treatment started at 21 days after infarction in rats studied after the drug had been administered for 4 months.",

The mean (+/- SEM) exercise time was 8.5 +/- 0.7 min with placebo, 8.3 +/- 0.6 min (95% confidence interval [CI]-1.06 to 0.54) with benazepril, 9.4 +/- 0.5 min (95% CI -0.32 to 2.14) with metoprolol OROS and 9.6 +/- 0.5 min (95% CI -0.25 to 2.47) with the combination of benazepril and metoprolol OROS. The mean exercise time to the development of 1 mm ST segment depression was prolonged from 6.0 +/- 0.6 min with placebo to 6.3 +/- 0.6 min (95% CI -0.93 to 1.45) with benazepril, 7.9 +/- 0.5 min (95% CI 0.83 to 3.0) with metoprolol OROS and 8.1 +/- 0.6 min (95% CI 0.88 to 3.29) with the combination of benazepril and metoprolol OROS. Benazepril did not alter the rest or maximal heart rate, whereas metoprolol OROS alone and in combination significantly lowered the heart rate at rest and during maximal exercise. Systolic blood pressure at rest was nonsignificantly reduced, whereas diastolic blood pressure was lowered significantly by all treatments in comparison with placebo. At maximal exercise, only metoprolol OROS, whether given alone or in combination with benazepril, was able to blunt significantly systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "334": "The protective effect of converting enzyme inhibitors in experimental hypertensive glomerular injury is associated with decreased systemic arterial and glomerular capillary pressure. Although calcium channel blockers effectively lower systemic blood pressure, their effect on glomerular capillary pressure and on hypertensive glomerular injury is uncertain. We compared equihypotensive treatment with the calcium antagonist TA 3090 or the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in post-salt hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats for up to 5 weeks after five sixths nephrectomy. Before the nephrectomy, all rats demonstrated hypertension (mean 177 mm Hg), proteinuria (mean 175 mg/day), and mild glomerulosclerosis (mean injury score 35). Rats treated with captopril or TA 3090 demonstrated a significant and equivalent decrease in systolic blood pressure compared with untreated rats at 2, 3, and 5 weeks after five sixths nephrectomy; however, only captopril reduced proteinuria. Final proteinuria was actually increased in rats treated with TA 3090 compared with untreated rats. Glomerular injury score was significantly decreased in captopril-treated compared with untreated rats at 2 weeks (33 +/- 9 versus 117 +/- 10, p less than 0.05) and 5 weeks (46 +/- 9 versus 94 +/- 24, p less than 0.05), whereas treatment with TA 3090 delayed but did not prevent progressive glomerular injury (2-week score 35 +/- 7, p less than 0.05 versus untreated; 5-week score 109 +/- 19, p = NS versus untreated). Thus, in hypertensive DS rats after subtotal nephrectomy, treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor reduced systemic blood pressure, proteinuria, and glomerulosclerosis. However, equihypotensive treatment with a calcium channel blocker did not reduce proteinuria and delayed but did not prevent glomerulosclerosis. Thus, in the rat similar reductions in systemic blood pressure with these two classes of agents have disparate effects on the progression of chronic renal failure.", 
    "335": "The renal and systemic changes after stenosis of the left renal artery (n = 5) or sham stenosis (n = 6) in conscious dogs were studied sequentially over 25 days. Stenosis produced a prompt rise in arterial pressure, which was at all times due to reduced peripheral vascular conductance, with no increase in cardiac output despite initial evidence of mild fluid retention. The decrease in peripheral conductance was attributable to 1) the stenotic kidney (25% of the total and due to the mechanical effect of the stenosis itself), 2) the nonstenotic kidney (about 15% of the total and not caused by angiotensin II), and 3) the nonrenal vasculature (60%). The decrease in conductance in the nonrenal vasculature was due partly to angiotensin II, but there was also a gradually developing non-angiotensin II component. Acute administration of captopril caused significantly greater changes in arterial pressure and peripheral conductance throughout the period of stenosis than before stenosis (and greater than in sham-stenosis dogs), indicating that angiotensin II was constricting the peripheral vasculature even when plasma renin levels were no longer elevated. In the stenotic kidneys, captopril produced a fall in renal vascular resistance, but renal blood flow did not rise because there was an approximately equal rise in the resistance of the stenosis. There was no evidence for a role for the autonomic nervous system in the hypertension, as ganglion blockade (pentolinium) had similar hemodynamic effects before and after stenosis. Thus, the hypertension was due at all times to reduced peripheral conductance, with the two kidneys responsible for 40% of this reduced conductance.",

A 15-mg oral dose of delapril was given once on the first and last days, and twice daily on the other days. The measurement of blood pressure and sampling were done at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours postdose on the first and last days of treatment. Plasma and urinary concentrations of delapril and its metabolites were measured by HPLC. ACE activity was suppressed from 1 hour after the first dose to 24 hours after the last dose of delapril in both the NRF and IRF groups. During the consecutive dosing, significant BP falls were observed from 1 hour postdose of delapril to 24 hours in the NRF group and to 6 hours in the IRF group. Peak plasma concentrations of 5-hydroxydelapril diacid and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of both delapril diacid and 5-hydroxydelapril diacid in the IRF group were significantly higher (p less than 0.001 or 0.05) than in the NRF group.

The regional haemodynamic effects of intravenous bolus doses of captopril, enalaprilat and lisinopril were assessed in conscious Brattleboro (i.e. vasopressin-deficient) rats, chronically instrumented with miniaturized pulsed Doppler probes and intravascular catheters. 2. Responses to incremental doses of each drug (spanning the median effective dose for the inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I) were examined in both water-replete and water-deprived states. 3. In the water-replete state, the haemodynamic profiles of captopril, enalaprilat and lisinopril were generally similar, with incremental doses causing rises in mesenteric and renal flow and, to a lesser extent, hindquarters flow. There were small tachycardias and only slight falls in mean blood pressure. 4. In the water-deprived state, the effects of all three drugs were greatly enhanced; tachycardic and hypotensive effects occurred together with increases in mesenteric, renal and hindquarters flows. However, for renal flow and renal vascular conductance the effectiveness of the drugs decreased in the order enalaprilat greater than captopril greater than lisinopril, whereas for mesenteric flow and mesenteric vascular conductance the order was captopril greater than enalaprilat greater than lisinopril. 5. Since marked haemodynamic actions were seen with doses one-tenth of the median effective dose for the inhibition of the pressor effect of angiotensin I, it is likely these effects were due to inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, although not necessarily to inhibition of angiotensin II production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The actions of this enzyme go beyond liberating angiotensin II from angiotensin I or inactivating bradykinin.

The recent molecular cloning of the human enzyme confirmed the existence of a hydrophobic C-terminal peptide that forms the short transmembrane domain of this plasma membrane-bound enzyme.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) may be implicated in the aetiology of some arrhythmia and sudden death. Recent evidence suggests that the relationship between LVH and arrhythmia may be complex and that there may be an interaction with serum potassium levels. ACE inhibitors have been shown to be anti-arrhythmic in heart failure. Although other vasodilators have been shown to be anti-arrhythmic, ACE inhibitors also raise serum potassium levels and this may therefore be of importance to their anti-arrhythmic activity.

The measurements were made before and three hours after the first dose, and after ten weeks of treatment. Both drugs lowered the elevated blood pressure and did not impair the normal systolic cardiac function. In the patients treated with cilazapril an improvement in indices of diastolic function was observed after the first dose. The normalized peak filling rate significantly increased from 2.4 +/- 0.7 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 counts and time to peak filling rate was shortened from 169.4 +/- 31.0 to 151.6 +/- 40.1 msec. This improvement was sustained or even enhanced during chronic therapy. In contrast hydrochlorothiazide acutely impaired one index of diastolic function, the normalised peak filling rate, and did not alter the other indices.

Lowering of blood pressure is no criterion of efficacy in prevention of cardiovascular morbidity, mortality and sudden death. The drugs used in early studies - diuretics, vasodilators and reserpine - greatly improved mortality from malignant hypertension, apoplectic stroke and congestive heart failure, but had little or no effect in persons with milder degrees of elevated blood pressure, who constitute the vast majority of hypertensives. The failure of diuretics and vasodilators to influence cardiovascular disease favorably appears due not to their known adverse effects on risk factors, such as lipids, as some have held, but to a failure - in conjunction with some sympathetic blocking agents - to cause effective regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, the keystone of successful therapy. A study of 674 hypertensive persons surveyed in the United States and eastern Canada, personally examined during their visit to a Florida health resort, has shown striking changes in prescribing practice during the period surveyed (1985-88), notably with increased use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and, to a lesser degree, increased use of calcium channel blockers. Both of these cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and will hopefully show long term benefit in decreasing hypertension mortality.

Ten sodium-loaded healthy men were enrolled in the study. Following cannulation of both femoral arteries and the right femoral vein, leg blood flow was determined (indocyanine-green dye-dilution method) at baseline conditions and during constant intra-arterial infusion of haemodynamically ineffective doses of ANG-I as well as following concomitant intra-arterial administration of low doses of the non-sulfhydril ACE inhibitor cilazapril. From the transfemoral arterio-venous differences in ANG-II plasma concentrations and the corresponding regional blood (plasma) flow, the ANG-II balance across the leg was calculated. Systemic blood pressure did not change throughout the trial, indicating that no major systemic effects were present during ANG-I infusion or concomitant ACE inhibition. Moreover, arterial ANG-II plasma concentrations were not significantly changed by ANG-I infusion. Leg blood flow decreased to below baseline values following ANG-I infusion, increasing again then in a dose-dependent manner during concomitant cilazapril administration.

The depressor responses to intra-arterial bradykinin injections 1) were not different between Brown Norway and Brown Norway-Hannover rats, 2) were potentiated by intravenous ramipril (60 micrograms), and 3) were attenuated by intra-arterial infusion of the bradykinin antagonist B4146 (40 micrograms/kg/min) to a similar extent in both strains.

A control group of 12 cases were on dietary therapy alone. During the 6-22 months of treatment, all the patients were kept on low-protein (0.6g/kg/d), and low-phosphorus (10mg/kg/d) diet. The results showed that the progression rate of renal failure, calculated by regression analysis of 1/Scr vs time, was found to be retarded after treatment with the increased regression coefficient (b value). Scr levels and blood urea nitrogen were kept stable or fell slightly. Albumin rose during the follow-up period (P less than 0.05) in the treated patients, being more marked in both Rheum E and Rheum E + Captopril groups. Uremic symptoms of nausea, anorexia improved in most of the treated patients. It is concluded that long-term low-dose Rheum E taken orally is beneficial to CRF. Its effect is better than that of Captopril. The regime of Rheum E and Captopril is a preferable choice in the long-term treatment for preventing progression of CRF.",

The purpose of this study was to quantify the release of bradykinin from contracting skeletal muscle. In 18 cats, blood samples were withdrawn directly from the venous effluent of the triceps surae muscles immediately before and after 30 s of static contraction producing peak muscle tensions of 33, 50, and 100% of maximum electrically stimulated contraction. Contractions producing muscle tensions of 50 and 100% of maximum increased muscle venous bradykinin levels by 27 +/- 9 and 19 +/- 10 pg/ml, respectively. Conversely, 33% maximum contraction did not alter muscle venous bradykinin concentrations. However, when captopril was administered to slow the degradation of bradykinin, muscle venous bradykinin increased from 68 +/- 15 pg/ml at rest to 106 +/- 18 after contractions of 33% of maximum. When muscle ischemia was induced by 2 min of arterial occlusion before and during 30 s of 33% of maximum contraction, muscle venous bradykinin increased by 15 +/- 5 pg/ml. In addition, contraction-induced changes in muscle venous pH and lactate strongly correlated with bradykinin concentrations (r = 0.80 and 0.83, respectively).

We used ACE and ketanserin because they have a hypotensive effect without developing tolerance, metabolic effects, rebound events in case of sudden interruption. These pharmacologic agents, which are active by themselves, can also be used in association with other hypotensive agents. Two exercise tolerance tests were carried out on each patient before and after each therapeutic period. Clinostatic systolic time intervals were assessed before and after treatment. Enalapril and ketanserin reduced systolic and diastolic pressure in basal condition and after exercise tolerance test, without any interference on heart rate.

STUDY DESIGN. This investigation was a randomized, double blind, cross-over versus placebo trial. At first, subjects whose blood pressure met the entry criteria (casual diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg), were subjected to 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and maximal upright bicycle stress testing including measurement of O2 uptake. Then they were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or enalapril. After one month they repeated stress testing and then they were crossed over. Stress testing was repeated in all subjects after two months. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was repeated in all subjects during enalapril treatment only, by a non-blind investigator. RESULTS. Ambulatory blood pressure decreased significantly during enalapril and no changes in heart rate were observed during the monitoring. The results of bicycle stress testing, both in basal and during the placebo test were comparable as regards blood pressure response, maximal workload, effort duration, maximal heart rate and VO2 max. With enalapril systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly during stress testing both versus basal test and placebo test at each workload considered including maximal workload. No changes were observed during enalapril as regards maximal workload, effort duration, maximal heart rate and VO2 max. CONCLUSION. Our results suggest that enalapril could be effective in treating hypertensive athletes because it reduces blood pressure during physical effort without affecting physical performance. We conclude that enalapril could be considered a first-choice drug in hypertensive athletes doing aerobic sports.",

Control of hypertension resulted in significant improvement of exercise performance in both the groups. Atenolol, when compared to captopril, resulted in better exercise conditioning with considerable lowering of resting and peak RPP and MVO2 (p less than 0.001), though the difference in exercise duration, maximum work load and recovery time were not significant (p greater than 0.05).

Particular consideration is given to the effects of these agents on heart rate, atrioventricular nodal conduction, and myocardial contractility in patients with other cardiovascular diseases. Diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have no significant direct effects on cardiac function. beta-Blockers inhibit catecholamine stimulation of the heart and may be particularly beneficial in treating patients with a history of myocardial infarction. Calcium channel blockers reduce blood pressure by dilating arterial resistance vessels. They are structurally heterogeneous and highly selective in their sites of action. As a consequence, cardiac effects can be minimized by selecting a calcium channel blocker with more potent peripheral vasodilatory effects. A new calcium channel blocker, isradipine, currently undergoing clinical trials, is highly selective for arterial smooth muscle and appears to be a safe and effective antihypertensive agent.",

    "359": "The present study was designed to examine and compare the acute effects of lisinopril (20 mg) and enalapril (10 mg) after a single oral administration on the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in eight normal subjects. Serum concentration of lisinopril and enalaprilat, an active metabolite of enalapril, reached the respective maximal levels at 6 and 4 hr after administration of the drugs. At 24 hr, the serum concentration of lisinopril was higher than that of enalapril; thus the rate of disappearance of lisinopril was retarded, in comparison to that of enalapril. The reduction of serum angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) activity was consistent with the pattern of increase of concentration of the drugs in the serum. However, with these two drugs, the concentration of plasma ANG II was decreased in a similar manner, and it returned to the pretreatment level within 24 hr. Thus, there was no significant difference in ANG II levels throughout the 24 hr-study between the lisinopril and enalapril treatment. The results indicate that a single administration of 20 mg lisinopril and 10 mg enalapril show similar potency for lowering the circulating ANG II level, although lisinopril exerts a more sustained inhibition of serum ACE activity. The measurement of ANG II provides useful informations for evaluating the efficacy of ACE inhibitors for the inhibition of circulatory RAS.", 
    "360": "Four compounds 1a-4a containing one L-lysine residue in the molecule including a diastereomer mixture of lisinopril (N-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-L-lysyl-L-proline) and N epsilon-carbobenzoxy-L-lysine derivatives 1b-4b of each of the four compounds were synthesized to compare the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities in vitro and in vivo. They all showed high ACE inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.14-42 nmol/l). A marked difference, however, was observed in inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I between 1a-4a (high activity) and 1b-4b (low activity). The binding of these compounds to human serum proteins in vitro was investigated by means of equilibrium dialysis and ultracentrifugation. Compounds 1b-4b showed higher levels of binding to serum albumin than that of the corresponding compounds 1a-4a, and the percentage of binding ranged from 20.1 to 89.1%. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of compounds 1b-4b in vitro was decreased by the addition of albumin in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggested that the difference in the protein binding rate of compounds is one of the important factors influencing the inhibitory activity in vivo.",

    "362": "Results of uncontrolled studies suggest that the duration of action of an ACE inhibitor may be an important determinant of renal impairment when using these agents to treat patients with heart failure. To determine whether there is experimental evidence for this hypothesis, we compared the effects of intermittent (captopril, 25 mg i.v. bolus twice daily) and continuous (captopril. 25 mg bolus, then 50 mg/day by constant infusion) ACE inhibition in an ovine model where heart failure was induced by rapid left ventricular pacing (LVP). Six sheep underwent three 4-day periods of LVP with intermittent, continuous, or no treatment (control) given in random order from the onset of LVP. Despite evidence that intermittent captopril administration allowed significant recovery of serum ACE activity (4.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.5 pmol/L before and after captopril bolus on day 4, p less than 0.001) and restitution of arterial pressure between successive boluses (48 +/- 7 vs. 41 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), there was no difference in the renal effects of intermittent and continuous ACE inhibition (creatinine clearance was 44 +/- 14 and 47 +/- 8 ml/min on day 4 of the intermittent and continuous phase, respectively). Nevertheless, there was a significant correlation between the decline in arterial pressure and fall in creatinine clearance induced by ACE inhibition (r = 0.65, p less than 0.05), with evidence that drug accumulation may potentiate hypotension and renal impairment should arterial pressure be reduced below the threshold for renal autoregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "363": "The antihypertensive effects and pharmacokinetic properties of lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were investigated in hypertensive patients with normal renal function (NRF, mean serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dl, n = 9) and those with impaired renal function (IRF, mean serum creatinine 1.7 mg/dl, n = 8). Lisinopril was administered orally (10-mg dose once daily for 5 or 8 days). Measurement of blood pressure (BP) and sampling of blood specimens were made on the first and last days of treatment. During consecutive dosing of lisinopril, its antihypertensive effects were sustained for greater than or equal to 12 h with less diurnal variation of BP. Serum ACE activity was markedly suppressed for 24 h. Plasma levels of lisinopril in the IRF group were higher than those in NRF with significant differences in the peak levels and areas under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC). A significant inverse correlation was found between the creatinine clearance and the AUC for lisinopril. These results suggest that lisinopril has a long-lasting action and that it is a useful antihypertensive agent for controlling BP in patients with either NRF or mild IRF. When administered for an extended period, however, more careful consideration should be given to the dose in patients with IRF than in patients with NRF to minimize the possibility of untoward side effects.", 
    "364": "To elucidate the important features of early renal disease in the diabetic dog, renal capillary permselectivity and fractional mesangial expansion with and without unilateral nephrectomy (NX) were examined. Pancreatectomized mongrel dogs (N = 9) received 10-20 U Regular and NPH insulin daily. Weekly blood glucose monitoring, 300 +/- 75 mg/dl (means +/- SD). Three dogs without NX had serial open needle biopsies 6-23 months post-pancreatectomy, revealing significant glomerular basement membrane widening and mesangial expansion. Without NX, inulin clearance increased from 2.55 +/- 0.89 (pre-diabetes) to 4.30 +/- 0.70 ml/min/kg body weight (N = 4, means +/- SD, p less than 0.05), whereas albuminuria, measured by radioimmunoassay, remained unchanged 2.57 +/- 1.03 (pre-diabetes) to 2.83 +/- 1.63 micrograms/min/kg body weight up to 23 months post-pancreatectomy. To determine whether altered renal capillary permselectivity occurred despite normal albuminuria, glomerular charge and size selectivity was analysed with serial fractional anionic dextran (20-44 A Stokes Einstein Radius) clearances. Furthermore, peritubular capillary permselectivity was probed with anionic and neutral 3H-dextran (26 A) using the multiple indicator dilution method. Fractional anionic dextran clearances remained unchanged up to 23 months, as did peritubular capillary permselectivity. Five diabetic dogs were compared to non-diabetic dogs with (N = 4) and without (N = 10) NX. To identify whether angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibition modified glomerular function or morphology, 3 diabetic + NX dogs received Captopril (5 mg/kg/day). At one year, diabetes + NX had an additive effect on renal hypertrophy, although fractional mesangial expansion was not enhanced by NX. Albuminuria was unaffected by NX or Captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "365": "Hypertension is accompanied by 2 major types of arterial pathologic conditions: smooth muscle hypertrophy of arteriolar resistance vessels and atherosclerosis, primarily involving the larger arteries. Smooth muscle hypertrophy may develop either as a secondary defense against elevated intravascular pressure or as a primary defect responsible for the increased pressure. Insulin and a number of other trophic stimuli may play a pathogenetic role in vascular hypertrophy. Reducing blood pressure and trophic stimuli may cause hypertrophy to be reversed. Because atherosclerosis may be markedly accelerated by hypertension, especially in the presence of concomitant risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive treatment may attenuate or even reverse the extent of atherosclerosis, but only when the causative factors are also corrected. Some commonly used antihypertensive agents, e.g., diuretics and beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, often aggravate hypercholesterolemia and glucose intolerance, thereby diminishing their potential protective value. Other types of drug therapy, such as alpha blockers, beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or other vasodilator activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium entry blockers that may not induce biochemical changes, should provide better control of multiple risks and thereby better protection against atherosclerosis. With a better understanding of how hypertension induces arterial damage, clinicians will be able to provide more appropriate treatment and, it is hoped, alleviate such damage.", 
    "366": "This article is a review of the literature concerning the effects of antihypertensive agents on the lipid status and thrombocyte function. Many investigations have revealed that thiazide diuretics, non-selective beta-blockers and beta-1 selective beta-blockers have resulted in alteration of lipids in a potentially atherogenic direction. Only thiazide diruetics have caused increase in low density lipoprotein, which is causally connected with increased tendency to atheroschlerosis. In some investigations, alpha-1 blockers have had a favourable effect on lipids in an atherogenic direction. Other antihypertensive agents appear, by and large, to be lipid neutral even although isolated investigations have demonstrated displacement of lipids both in positive and negative directions. Non-selective beta-blockers appear to alter thrombocyte function towards a greater tendency to aggregation while beta-1 selective beta-blockers are neutral. Ca-antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and ketanserin have, theoretically, anti-aggregatory effects on the thrombocytes but only few ex vivo and in vivo experiments have confirmed this effect. Monitoring of lipids is recommended before and after antihypertensive treatment. Finally, the effect on thrombocyte function should be considered in the choice of hypertensive agent.", 
    "367": "Stimulation of the renin angiotensin system, catecholamines and antidiuretic hormone causes prominent vasoconstriction in severe heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reverse these effects, and thus ameliorate cardiac function and reduce mortality in severe heart failure. Angiotensin II is an important regulator of renal function in diseases with renal hypoperfusion, and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may cause a serious decrease in glomerular filtration and hyperkalemia. Asymptomatic heart failure, acute heart failure and acute myocardial infarction are areas where angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may prove beneficial in the future.", 
    "368": "The effect of glutathione (GSH) depletion on the immunogenicity of captopril (CP) and D-penicillamine (PA) was investigated in C57 mouse. Depletion of GSH was by DL-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a potent and specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis, injected on the days of immunization of the drug/drug-protein conjugates. Chronic BSO pretreatment for 5 consecutive days, before and including the 4-day immunization period, caused tissue GSH depletion (liver 60%, kidney 71%, lung 14%, spleen 14% and whole blood 36%) in C57 mouse. After chronic administration of CP (270 mumol/kg, i.p. or i.m.) or CP-HSA (200 micrograms, i.p. or i.m.), IgG antibody response to CP-derived antigen was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IgG antibody recognised CP-OVA but not OVA, and was inhibited by CP in other protein conjugated form, thus confirming its specificity to CP. Depletion of GSH by BSO caused an increase in the CP-specific IgG antibody titre when CP/CP-HSA was immunized through i.p. (with or without Freund's Complete Adjuvant) but not i.m. administration. In contrast, chronic administration of PA (270 mumol/kg, i.p.) or PA-HSA (200 micrograms, i.p.), with or without BSO pre-treatment, did not lead to detectable PA-specific IgG antibody. The results again illustrate the difference in the intrinsic immunogenicity between CP and PA, in that depletion of GSH increased the humoral (B lymphocyte) anti-CP responses but not anti-PA responses under the experimental conditions. These findings suggest that GSH status, apart from its effects on the disposition of CP/CP-protein conjugates, should be considered as an important determinant of both the immunological and toxicological response to CP.", 
    "369": "Adenosine and adenosine receptor agonists have a variety of inhibitory effects on the generation of inflammatory mediators by neutrophils and other cell types. In human neutrophils stimulated with the chemotactic peptide FMLP, adenosine agonists inhibit O2- generation and degranulation. Because these findings suggest that the agonists may have potential as antiinflammatory agents, several compounds were evaluated for effects on the exudative and cellular phases of carrageenan-induced pleural inflammation in rats. All of the agonists tested inhibited both parameters of the inflammatory response. Inhibition appeared to correlate better with binding to the A1 than to the A2 receptor and was reversible by a known adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline. In mechanistic studies, R-N-(1-methyl-2-phenylethyl)adenosine, a standard A1 selective agonist, reversed the drop in circulating neutrophil count that occurs after injection of carrageenan. These results suggest that the agonists may prevent cell emigration by inhibiting adhesion to the endothelium or diapedesis. In addition (R)-N-(1-methyl-2-phenylethyl)adenosine had weak inhibitory effects on superoxide production by FMLP-stimulated rat neutrophils. Control studies showed that the effects of the agonists were not the result of agonist-induced hypotension nor corticosterone production by the adrenal glands. These findings indicate that adenosine receptor agonists are effective new pharmacologic tools for the study of inflammatory processes.", 
    "370": "Eleven patients with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 95-115 mmHg) were treated for four weeks with daily single quinapril doses of 20-40 mg. Already during the second week a significant reduction in blood pressure was observed without increase of heart rate; 27.3% of patients responded to the lower dose (diastolic blood pressure [90 mmHg], and 54.6% responded to the higher dose. Drug treatment led to reduced pressure increase in response to cold stimulation without influencing the adrenergic response both in basal conditions and after cold pressor test. The drug brought about peripheral vasodilatation as shown by increased perfusion index during Doppler ultrasound examination, and improved arterial reactivity with increased perfusion index and reduced recovery time after ischemia. The reduction of angiotensin and aldosterone plasma levels during treatment was not correlated to diminished blood pressure values, indicating that the antihypertensive effect can occur via pathways different from ACE inhibition. Tolerance was excellent as shown both by clinical and laboratory evidence.", 
    "371": "A sensitive enzyme immunoassay was developed for human angiotensin converting enzyme. Monoclonal antibodies specific for two unique converting enzyme epitopes were utilized to develop a two-site sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated to the detecting antibody hydrolyzes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to NAD. Subsequently, NAD is cycled between its reduced and oxidized forms by an alcohol dehydrogenase/diaphorase catalyzed redox cycle. Each cycle converts iodonitrotetrazolium violet to a highly colored formazan which is quantitated. With this assay, as little as 94 pg/ml of native converting enzyme is detectable without interference from either therapeutic or endogenous converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "372": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been associated with the onset of angioedema in a small subset of treated patients. The angioedema commonly involves the face and oropharyngeal tissues and may result in life-threatening airway compromise. The mechanism by which ACE inhibitors precipitate angioedema has not been well-defined, and retrospective analysis of reported cases has failed to identify a group of patients at high risk. We report four cases of ACE inhibitor-related angioedema that required immediate medical intervention. All four cases occurred in patients with a prior history of idiopathic angioedema, an otherwise uncommon clinical entity. These observations suggest that patients with a history of idiopathic angioedema are at increased risk for the development of ACE inhibitor-related angioedema and should be treated cautiously with this class of drugs.", 
    "373": "Acute coronary syndrome is defined as unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. A discussion on drug treatment of these conditions was arranged by the Norwegian Society of Cardiology and the Department of Pharmacotherapeutics, University of Oslo, soon after preliminary results of the GISSI II study were available. Relatively simple rules were agreed for the use of analgetics, nitrates and fibrinolytic agents. The last are used only after established myocardial injury. Consensus was also reached on the restricted use of calcium antagonists, inotropic agents and diuretics. There was disagreement concerning the dosage of heparin and the exact use of betablockers, aspirin, warfarin, ACE-inhibitors, magnesium and antiarrhythmics.", 
    "374": "Since diabetes and hypertension frequently coexist in the same patient, it is important to consider that many antihypertensive agents may have diverse effects on carbohydrate metabolism, lipid profiles, and overall glycemic control, thus further confounding the management of patients with both diseases. The two cases below illustrate the potential metabolic effects of four commonly used antihypertensive medications (thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers) and emphasize the complex interaction between these two common diseases and their treatments.", 
    "375": "Glomerular mesangial and endothelial cells have key roles in the regulation of glomerular blood flow, both under normal circumstances and in pathologic states. The anatomic structure of the glomerulus is such that the endothelial and mesangial cells are in close proximity to each other and consequently may communicate through a number of cellular mediators. Vasodilatory substances, such as prostacyclin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and vasoconstrictive substances, such as endothelin, are released by endothelial cells and can interact with mesangial cells to affect glomerular blood flow. The ability of plasma macromolecules to enter and circulate through the mesangium may play an important role in the development of glomerular injury. Angiotensin II has been shown to increase the uptake and decrease the rate of disappearance of certain macromolecules in the mesangium; this action is blocked, at least partially, by angiotensin II receptor antagonists and by calcium channel blockers. Experimental studies have suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may prevent or arrest progression of renal injury. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may ave a beneficial effect by decreasing intraglomerular pressure through inhibition of angiotensin II predominant constriction of the glomerular efferent arteriole and possibly by decreasing mesangial trafficking of macromolecules. Calcium channel blockers may have beneficial effects on intracellular events that occur because of injury of either endothelial or mesangial cells.", 
    "376": "A national survey of family physicians, general practitioners, and pediatricians revealed substantial physician differences in managing cardiovascular disease risk factors in children aged 2 to 18 years. Pediatricians tended to screen younger children but were more conservative in treatment. General practitioners tended to screen less and to initiate intervention in older children, but were more aggressive in therapy. While only 9% of surveyed physicians measured blood cholesterol levels routinely, 72% screened children with family histories of cardiovascular disease. The majority routinely measured blood pressure, but the ages of first measurements differed among physicians. Surprisingly, of those who had treated children with elevated blood pressure or blood cholesterol, 54% said that they had ever used antihypertensive and 12% used lipid-lowering drugs in children, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and clofibrate. Half the surveyed physicians felt prepared to provide dietary counseling, but only 14% felt successful with it. When asked what they considered were the major cardiovascular risk factors, less than one third of the physicians cited all three major factors: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking.", 
    "377": "Nonadrenergic, noncholinergic contractile responses of guinea pig hilar bronchi to transmural electrical stimulation (TES) have been suggested to be due to release of endogenous tachykinins from capsaicin-sensitive neurons (C-fibers). Thiorphan and phosphoramidon, inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (NEP, the major enzyme responsible for degrading tachykinins), were found to potentiate contractile responses of this isolated airway segment to TES and exogenously applied capsaicin, substance P and neurokinin A. However, the magnitude of potentiation by either inhibitor was smaller for TES and capsaicin (less than 10-fold leftward shift) than for the substrate agonists (about 100-fold leftward shift). This quantitative difference in potentiation by NEP inhibitors does not appear to be due to an influence of vasoactive intestinal peptide or calcitonin gene-related peptide, two endogenous peptides that might be released concomitantly by TES. Neither peptide caused marked effects on contractile responses to TES or tachykinins when applied to the isolated tissues. Addition of inhibitors of serine proteases, aminopeptidases, acetylcholinesterase and angiotensin-converting enzyme failed to further potentiate responses to TES in the presence of thiorphan. Therefore, the contractile response does not appear to be further modified by the activity of these peptidases. Neuropeptide gamma, but not neuropeptide K, was potentiated by thiorphan. The data suggest that peptides that are not substrates for NEP (for example, neuropeptide K) may also be released by TES from capsaicin-sensitive neurons to cause contraction. This may, at least in part, explain the quantitative difference in potentiation by NEP inhibitors of contractile responses to TES and to exogenously applied NEP-sensitive tachykinins in the guinea pig hilar bronchus.", 
    "378": "Three groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were given enalapril (25 mg/kg/day) from 4 to 9 weeks, 4 to 14 weeks, and 14 to 20 weeks of age. The drug was stopped and observations continued for another 16-21 weeks. At selected times, we measured blood pressure, in vitro hindquarter vascular resistance properties, left ventricular weight/body weight ratio, and skeletal muscle vessel norepinephrine kinetics in treated and untreated SHR and in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. At the end of each treatment period, all cardiovascular variables were close to values of WKY rats and well below those of untreated SHR, and the norepinephrine or fractional rate constant was about 25% below those levels. After enalapril was stopped, blood pressure and left ventricular weight/body weight ratio increased in parallel to levels ranging from 30% to 50% of the normal difference between untreated SHR and WKY rats. However, in SHR treated from 4 to 9 weeks and from 4 to 14 weeks of age, hindquarter resistance properties remained close to WKY rat levels for the entire observation period of 16-21 weeks after treatment, suggesting suppression of the enhanced resistance responses of SHR (amplifier properties). In SHR treated from 14 to 20 weeks of age, suppression of amplifier properties was more transient, and they redeveloped partially 5-6 weeks after cessation of therapy. When enalapril was given up to 14 weeks of age, the long-term suppression of amplifier properties was probably mainly through prevention of smooth muscle hypertrophy in resistance vessels and possibly through other mechanisms (e.g., \"rarefaction\").(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "379": "Cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and muscle tension were simultaneously measured in aortic tissue isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, and SHR chronically treated with a novel angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, CS-622. In the presence of 2.5 mM Ca2+ in the bathing solution, aortic [Ca2+]i measured with fura-2 was higher in SHR than in WKY rats, and it was almost the same in CS-622-treated SHR and untreated WKY rats. Increase of external Ca2+ concentration from zero to 2.5 mM elicited a contraction in SHR aortas but not in aortas from both CS-622-treated SHR and untreated WKY rats. When the aortas were contracted by 60 mM K+, however, [Ca2+]i as well as developed tension was similar in the three groups. CGP-28392 (10(-6) M), a Ca2+ channel activator, induced a rhythmic activity superimposed on a gradual increase of [Ca2+]i and tension in SHR aortas but not in the aortas of CS-622-treated SHR or untreated WKY rats. Nicardipine (10(-7) M) decreased the resting [Ca2+]i and the resting tone in SHR aortas, but not in WKY rat aortas. These results suggest that SHR aortas have a higher myogenic tone due to increased [Ca2+]i than WKY rat aortas and that the increased [Ca2+]i is attributed to alterations of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels in SHR aortas. Further, the decrease of the vascular tone induced by long-term administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may be due to a reduction of increased [Ca2+]i in SHR.",

Changes in tension in response to cumulative additions of angiotensins (i.e., angiotensinogen, angiotensin I and angiotensin II), bradykinin and acetylcholine were monitored isometrically on ring preparations from porcine interlobar renal arteries. 2. Angiotensins consistently elicited contractile responses, whereas both bradykinin and acetylcholine produced relaxation of the arterial rings when active tone was induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha. 3. Contractile responses to angiotensin II could be completely blocked by the combined action of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (1 microM) and the lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguairetic acid (NDGA, 10 microM). 4. Relaxant responses to bradykinin were unchanged during blockade of thromboxane A2 synthesis by dazoxiben (30 microM) and proved to be largely resistant to blockade by indomethacin (1 microM) and the prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin) synthesis inhibitor, tranylcypromine (40 microM). 5. The angiotensin receptor blocker, saralasin (10 and 100 nM) antagonized responses to angiotensinogen, angiotensin I and angiotensin II effectively and with similar potency. Enalaprilic acid, the active metabolite of the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (300 nM), attenuated responses to angiotensin I but failed to inhibit those to angiotensinogen up to 1 microM. The serine protease kallikrein (0.001 to 1 mu ml-1) produced a dose-dependent shift to the left of the concentration-response curve for angiotensinogen. 6.

These results indicate that, in vivo, both captopril and CL242,817 are competitive, tight binding inhibitors of lung ACE.

In 18 hypertensives with hippuran renogram indicating renovascular disease, and in 27 essential hypertensives, the plasma renin activity (PRA) responses to an oral test dose (50 mg) of captopril were studied. A 60-minute post captopril PRA increase of 150% (or 400% if baseline PRA less than 3 ng/ml/h) was considered as positive. Digital venous angiography was performed in all cases. In the group of 18 subjects small congenital kidney in 7, and renal artery stenosis in 11 subjects were detected by angiography. Captopril test resulted negative in all patients with small congenital kidney (mean PRA% increase 58). The test identified 7 of the 11 renal artery stenoses (mean PRA% increase 477), sensitivity and specificity were 64% and 100% respectively. In the essential hypertensives-group, mean PRA% increase was 122; there were three false positives, and both sensitivity and specificity were 88%. This study demonstrates that the PRA response to oral captopril test is a useful screening test for distinguishing small congenital kidney from renal artery stenosis and for identifying the latter in hypertensive patients.", 
    "391": "We evaluated the efficacy of an ACE inhibitor captopril (CAP) for the reduction of proteinuria in glomerular diseases, and tried to find the conditions in which urinary protein excretion was significantly decreased by this drug. Renin provocation test by CAP (C-test) was performed, and the result was compared to the effect on proteinuria. In 33 patients with proteinuria, ranging from 1.1 to 14.1 g/day, CAP was administered. Urinary protein excretion was reduced from 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 2.8 +/- 0.4 g/day (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) after 2 weeks. The decrease in urinary protein was significant when renal function was moderately impaired (30 less than or equal to Ccr less than 60 ml/min) or patients were on a salt diet less than 7 g of NaCl daily. Reduction of urinary protein excretion by 2-week treatment of CAP was correlated with the result of C-test (r = 0.874, p less than 0.025). The long-term follow up for more than 6 months also suggested that CAP delayed the deterioration of renal function. Thus, CAP was proved effective in treating proteinuria, and C-test might give us an information of its proteinuria-suppressing effect in an individual case. But its efficacy was observed only in patients with moderately-reduced renal function or on low-salt diet. Therefore, we should select the cases carefully to expect the effect of CAP for the reduction of proteinuria.", 
    "392": "With the present increasing concern for compliance and quality or life during antihypertensive treatment, drug therapy tailored optimally for the individual patient is becoming increasingly important. The aim of the present double-blind crossover study was to analyse the individual as well as the group blood pressure response under enalapril and atenolol. Our results show that the group effects of these drugs did not differ significantly. However, individually, two-thirds of the responding patients showed a preference for either enalapril or atenolol. A response to one drug did not predict a comparable response to the other drug. We conclude that double-blind crossover studies are a possible way of individualizing antihypertensive treatment. However, no appropriate methodology or definitions of terms for these studies have yet been established.", 
    "393": "When a new drug is developed, one of the first requirements is to establish the correct dose. Unfortunately, in dose-determination studies, not enough lessons have been learned from the past. Pilot studies are often planned without sufficient statistical power, due to an insufficient number of patients and highly variable blood pressure measurements. In the development of the new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril, crossover trials were used to obtain useful information. At the end of phase II of the benazepril development, a double-blind crossover study was carried out with 25 patients, and the results made it possible to redefine the 12- and 24-h effects of benazepril in comparison with placebo. Moreover, the crossover trial allowed an investigation of the biological effects of the treatment. In further work, the efficacy of 10 mg benazepril, administered once a day, was confirmed in comparison with captopril and enalapril, with a beta-risk of less than 20%. Since this crossover study yielded reliable data, and there was no carryover effect, a similar crossover design was used to study the interaction between benazepril and nifedipine. In the past, mistakes were made and many antihypertensive drugs were administered in high doses, with no further beneficial effect on blood pressure and an increased risk of side effects. Work described in this paper shows that fewer but better designed and implemented studies can improve the efficiency and value of dose-finding studies for antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "394": "In studying patients with mild hypertension, we used a double-blind, randomly allocated crossover, 2 x 2 factorial design to obtain more precise estimates of the effectiveness of individual hypertensive drugs and of the interactions when used in combination. In the present study, we reanalysed data from our own previously completed crossover factorial studies in order to determine the optimal length of phases and to try to exploit patient heterogeneity by comparing blood pressure responses within each patient to the two different drugs in each study. An analysis of the 'weeks within phases' variation (analysis of variance) applied to all phases, to the placebo phases alone and to the active treatment phases alone, of the individual factorial studies and of pooled data from studies of similar design, only revealed differences in the first week of our 4-week phases. Accordingly, we suggest that 4 weeks is an optimal phase length, since only the values from the third and fourth weeks showed the full expression of a drug's antihypertensive effect, avoiding the problem of a carryover effect and the need for a more complex intervening washout placebo phase. Comparing the blood pressure reductions shown by individual patients in response to different antihypertensive drugs using arbitrary criteria of greater than or equal to 5, 10 and 15 mmHg for diastolic and greater than or equal to 5, 10 and 20 mmHg for systolic pressure, we were unable to distinguish between the two separate drugs in each factorial study, due to the magnitude of the background variation which had a coefficient of variation of 5-7%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "395": "The ACE-inhibiting drugs enalapril and captopril may result in a chronic and sometimes severe cough for which no pathologic cause can be found. Drug-induced cough should therefore be considered in any symptomatic patient taking these medications. In such cases, prompt withdrawal of the drug and substitution of a non-ACE inhibitor is curative and conserves the time and resources of the patient and the physician by avoiding unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic measures.", 
    "396": "Glomerular diseases are characterized by increased urinary protein excretion. Treatment of this abnormality frequently involves administration of corticosteroids and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. There has been much recent interest in the potential impact of these drugs on progressive renal dysfunction, since they have opposing effects on intraglomerular hemodynamics. Therefore, we investigated the effect of methylprednisolone or captopril treatment on animals with chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy. In rats given a single injection of puromycin aminonucleoside, 15 mg/100 g body weight, both methylprednisolone and captopril significantly reduced proteinuria at 6 months [83 +/- 14 untreated (n = 7), 34 +/- 6 with methylprednisolone (n = 8), and 6 +/- 1 mg/24 h with captopril (n = 5), P less than 0.001]. Segmental glomerulosclerosis occurred with equal frequency in the untreated (7.8 +/- 2.3%) and methylprednisolone-treated rats (5.0 +/- 1.11%), but was significantly reduced by the administration of captopril (1.0 +/- 0.5%, P less than 0.001). We conclude that in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy, treatment with corticosteroids reduces proteinuria without increasing the incidence of segmental glomerulosclerosis. Therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor substantially decreases proteinuria and lessens the severity of glomerular scarring.", 
    "397": "A 22 year old woman presented with lupus nephritis, hypertension, and intractable nephrotic syndrome. Albumin and furosemide given intravenously was ineffective. Captopril administered in a daily dose of 62.5 mg was associated with a reduction in proteinuria from 28 g/24 hours to 11.5 g/24 hours over 10 weeks, resulting in a weight reduction of 16 kg. This was achieved with relative preservation of renal function. Captopril should be considered in the treatment of intractable proteinuria in patients with lupus nephritis, or when cytotoxic drugs are refused, because of its efficacy and relative safety. Captopril should, however, be used as an adjunct and not as a substitute for standard treatment.", 
    "398": "Calcium channel blockers may alter parathyroid hormone secretion in vitro, which would alter calcium homeostasis. To determine the chronic effect of calcium channel blockade in vivo, we conducted a randomized, double blind, 16 week study comparing the effects of two pharmacologic antihypertensive agents, the calcium channel blocker diltiazem and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on parameters of calcium homeostasis. Both diltiazem and captopril lowered blood pressure to a similar degree. Neither drug produced any significant change in blood levels of total and ionized calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus, which affect the regulation of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. In addition, at eight or 16 weeks following initiation, neither drug altered the serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 (1,25-D). Chronic calcium channel blockade with diltiazem does not alter serum parameters of calcium homeostasis and, thus, should not affect bone mineralization.", 
    "399": "Recent studies have shown a possible role of different factors in the regulation of prolactin secretion. In fact many neurotransmitters (dopamine) and peptides can modulate prolactin release from anterior pituitary lactotrophs. In vitro and in vivo studies, Angiotensin II has been shown to increase prolactin release. On the basis of these data we have studied the effects of enalapril (ACE-Inhibitor) on baseline plasma prolactin in nine hypertensive post-menopausal women. The results indicate that 15-day inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by enalapril significantly reduced serum prolactin levels. These data suggest that the Angiotensin II may play a role in the control of prolactin secretion in hypertensive women.", 
    "400": "The purpose of these studies was to quantitatively assess the role of endogenous angiotensin II activity in controlling transport in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) and whole nephron. We used the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753, which lacks the agonist and kinin/prostaglandin-inducing properties of saralasin and captopril, respectively. During in vivo microperfusion in the Munich-Wistar rat, we found that DuP 753 had a powerful inhibitory effect on bicarbonate (370 +/- 3 to 200 +/- 9 pEq/mm.min, P less than 0.001), chloride (214 +/- 3 to 105 +/- 9 pEq/mm.min, P less than 0.001), and water (5.2 +/- 0.1 to 2.8 +/- 0.2 nl/mm.min, P less than 0.001) absorption in the S1 subsegment of the PCT. At maximally effective doses, DuP 753 (10 mg/kg i.v.) was significantly more effective than was captopril (3 mg/kg i.v.) in inhibiting sodium chloride transport in the S1 PCT. DuP 753 is the most potent diuretic ever described in this segment. Consistent with the axial decline of angiotensin II receptor density in the PCT, DuP 753 was a less effective transport inhibitor in the S2 subsegment of the PCT, similar to captopril. Though downstream reabsorptive elements partially compensate for the action in the earliest segment of the nephron, we also showed using free-flow micropuncture and clearance techniques that DuP 753 induces a substantial diuresis, natriuresis and chloruresis. In conclusion, the marked decrease in S1 PCT fluid and electrolyte absorption induced by DuP 753 indicates that endogenous angiotensin II exerts significant tonic support of proximal transport in vivo.", 
    "401": "Acute stimulation of renal renin secretion has been reported to increase, not change, or decrease intra-renal renin (IRR) content. However, these effects and the potential mechanisms for acute changes in IRR content have not been studied directly. In this study, the effect of acute stimulation of renin secretion on IRR content was studied directly using a new in vivo blood perfused rabbit kidney preparation. Following removal of the right kidney for determination of IRR content (N = 7) the left kidney was cannulated and perfused for an average of 55 minutes (baseline) at mean arterial blood pressure. Renin secretion by the left kidney was subsequently stimulated by reducing renal perfusion pressure to 60 mm Hg and administering enalapril, 1 mg/kg intravenously. After 38 to 140 minutes (mean 90 min) of stimulation, the left kidney was also removed and IRR content assessed. Renal blood flow and renin secretory rate (RSR) were determined frequently at baseline and following stimulation of renin secretion. The total amount of renin secreted in response to acute stimulation was calculated by integrating the RSR response over time. RSR from the left kidney increased by 515% during acute stimulation. IRR content in the left kidney also increased and averaged 16% greater than the right kidney from the same animal. In order to account for all of the renin secreted as well as the increase in IRR content following acute stimulation, it was calculated that the renin synthesis rate would have been required to increase over 26-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "402": "Oxygen-free radical intermediates/scavengers were measured in 43 patients with essential hypertension who, although under antihypertensive therapy (without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), still had high blood pressure values. Measurements were taken before and 30, 60 and 120 min after sublingual administration of 25 mg captopril. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced significantly. Twenty normotensive healthy volunteers were used as controls. The hypertensive patients had lower glutathione peroxide activity (GSHPx), higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and serum glutathione reductase activity (GSHRx) compared with the controls. After captopril (30, 60 min) the glutathione and GSHPx increased compared with the pretreatment values. SOD and GSHRx remained high compared with the controls, while whole blood glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase remained low. Another group of 19 essential hypertensive patients, free of any antihypertensive medication (for at least 3 weeks), had lower GSHPx, SOD and higher GSHRx than the normal control group. Our results show significant differences in the oxygen free radical scavenger system of hypertensives compared with the normal subjects. It may be that captopril has a concomitant scavenging action together with its antihypertensive effect. Our study raises the question whether cell/organ damage will occur in hypertensive patients exposed to oxidative stress during periods of low antioxidative capacity.", 
    "403": "Recently there has been extensive development of orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in addition to those already marketed, for example, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril. It was initially thought that ACE inhibitors were likely to be most useful as antihypertensive agents in conditions in which circulating renin and angiotensin II were elevated. However, it is now clear that they can also lower arterial pressure when plasma renin is not high. In addition, they have beneficial effects in cardiac failure. Thus, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril can be used in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension either alone or in conjunction with diuretics or calcium antagonists. Broadly speaking, efficacy appears to be similar to that of beta-blockers or diuretics. Unfortunately, however, there are no long term studies comparing one ACE inhibitor with another or with other classes of antihypertensive agents. Furthermore, there are no prognostic studies which show that use of ACE inhibitors reduces morbidity or mortality in hypertension. Many new ACE inhibitors are undergoing clinical assessment, including alacepril, cilazapril, fosenopril, perindopril, quinapril and ramipril. The drugs vary, in that some exist in the active form whereas others are prodrugs which are converted to the active agent following absorption. In addition they each possess one of several ligands, for example, carboxyl, phosphinyl or sulfhydryl groups, and so vary in their affinity for ACE. Although many of these agents are renally excreted, a small number are metabolised via the liver (e.g. quinapril and spirapril) and this may prove advantageous in the presence of renal impairment. In common with captopril and enalapril, the new ACE inhibitors inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and initial results suggest that they are effective in lowering blood pressure in essential hypertension. Furthermore, they reduce systemic vascular resistance in the absence of a reflex tachycardia. There are a number of adverse effects which are attributable to the pharmacological mechanism of the ACE inhibitors as a group; these include hypotension, particularly in patients with high renin levels, prior diuretic use, renal impairment or in the elderly. Additional adverse effects may relate to chemical structure. The high incidence of adverse effects noted in early studies related to excess dosage and to the presence of a sulfhydryl group, which the more recently developed ACE inhibitors lack. The adverse effects most commonly reported with established and new ACE inhibitors include headache and fatigue, cough, skin rashes, hypotension and diarrhoea. As a group, ACE inhibitors have an acceptable but not negligible adverse effect burden.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "404": "Two markedly hypertensive patients in their 70s both had been on captopril for months when they each developed life threatening angioedema. Their families and physicians responded promptly and effectively in saving their lives with one patient receiving tracheotomy and the other 24 h of intensive care with adrenaline, hydrocortisone and antihistamines. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are not without their significant risks and should not be used when less dangerous but equally efficacious medication is available.", 
    "405": "Captopril, an angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor, ameliorates the renal mesangial lesions associated with subtotal nephrectomy, a process associated with increased mesangial macromolecular flux and injury. In the present study uninephrectomized rats with proteinuria and focal glomerular sclerosis had increased mesangial heat-aggregated human IgG (AHIgG) uptake. However, uninephrectomized rats treated daily with captopril, which failed to develop either glomerular lesions or proteinuria, also had significantly elevated mesangial AHIgG levels. Our results suggest that increased mesangial macromolecular flux may occur independent of altered glomerular permselectivity changes and proteinuria and appears to be related to glomerular hyperfiltration rather than glomerular hypertension. Further, glomerular mesangial sclerosis may not be the direct result of increased mesangial macromolecular flux.", 
    "406": "Conventional therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF) includes sodium-restricted diet, diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators, and short-term intravenous administration of beta-adrenergic agonists during episodes of decompensation. A specific class of vasodilators, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, has recently gained predominance in the treatment of congestive heart failure. The primary mechanism of action is to reduce production of angiotensin II by competitive inhibition of the enzyme that converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II. Reduced levels of angiotensin II, in turn, promote vasodilation and lower aldosterone production. The benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in chronic congestive heart failure have been demonstrated by improvement in left ventricular performance, exercise capacity, functional status (using New York Heart Association classification), and survival.", 
    "407": "Five patients, who had never received any drug treatment but who had severe chronic congestive heart failure with salt and water retention, were studied before and after a single dose of enalapril (10 mg orally). Three patients continued on enalapril as monotherapy (10 mg b.d. orally) for one month. Central haemodynamics, body fluid volumes, renal function and plasma hormones were measured at rest. The initial mean right atrial pressure was 13 +/- 4 mm Hg, pulmonary wedge pressure 29 +/- 4 mm Hg and cardiac index 1.8 +/- 0.21/min/m2. Enalapril, given acutely, caused only small changes. Two patients were withdrawn after the single dose of enalapril and treated with diuretics for clinical reasons. The remaining three patients each lost more than 4 kg in weight after one month of treatment with enalapril alone. Total body exchangeable sodium and total body water were reduced but central haemodynamics were unchanged. Although enalapril was of some benefit when given alone to patients with severe congestive heart failure, all five patients were finally treated with diuretics for clinical reasons. Enalapril is not recommended as the initial and only therapy for patients with severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "408": "Increasing evidence suggests that the renin-angiotensin system modulates cardiovascular homeostasis both via its circulating, plasma-borne components and through locally present, tissue-resident systems with site-specific activity. The existence of such a system in the heart has been proposed, based on biochemical studies as well as on the demonstration of renin and angiotensinogen messenger RNA in cardiac tissue. We conducted the present study to determine whether biologically active angiotensin peptides may be cleaved within the heart from locally present angiotensinogen. Isolated, perfused rat hearts were exposed to infusions of purified hog renin; the coronary sinus effluent was collected and subsequently assayed for angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II) by high-pressure liquid chromatography and specific radioimmunoassay. Both Ang I and II were undetectable under control conditions but appeared promptly after the addition of renin. Dose-dependent peak values for Ang I release ranged from 2.42 +/- 0.65 fmol/min to 1.38 +/- 0.18 pmol/min during renin infusions at concentrations between 10 microunits/ml and 5 milliunits/ml. Ang II levels measured in the perfusate reflected a mean fractional intracardiac conversion of Ang I to Ang II of 7.18 +/- 1.09%. Generation of Ang I and Ang II was inhibited in the presence of specific inhibitors of renin and converting enzyme, respectively. To investigate the source of angiotensinogen, we measured spontaneous angiotensinogen release from isolated perfused hearts. In the absence of renin in the perfusate, angiotensinogen was initially released in high, but rapidly declining, concentrations and subsequently at a low, but stable, rate. Prior perfusion with angiotensinogen-rich plasma resulted in enhanced early angiotensinogen release but did not alter the second, delayed phase, suggesting that, in addition to plasma-derived substrate, locally produced angiotensinogen may also participate in the intracardiac formation of angiotensin. Supporting this interpretation, hearts from animals pretreated with dexamethasone showed increased angiotensinogen messenger RNA concentrations as well as increased rates of angiotensinogen release not only during the early but also during the late phase. Our study newly demonstrates that Ang I and II may be formed within the isolated heart from locally present substrate, which appears to be derived in part from the circulating pool and in part from endogenous synthesis. These findings add support to the concept of a functionally active and locally integrated cardiac renin-angiotensin system and emphasize its potential physiological and pathological relevance.", 
    "409": "The orally active angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) such as captopril and enalapril represent a significant therapeutic advance in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Enalapril differs from captopril in several respects. It is a prodrug converted by hepatic esterolysis to the active (but more poorly absorbed) diacid, enalaprilat. Enalaprilat is more potent than captopril, more slowly eliminated and does not possess a sulfhydryl (SH) group. Enalapril was rapidly followed by a number of newer ACE inhibitors, the majority of which are similar to enalapril in that they are prodrugs, converted by hepatic esterolysis to a major active but poorly absorbed diacid metabolite. In one case (delapril) there are 2 active metabolites; in another (alacepril) the prodrug is converted in vivo to captopril. Lisinopril is an exception in that it is an enalaprilat-like diacid but with acceptable oral bioavailability, so that the prodrug route is not employed. The newer ACE inhibitors are at widely different stages of development, and it is not yet clear how many will reach regular clinical use. Of these newer drugs, lisinopril is the longest established and is the subject of the widest published literature. For a number there is as yet little published pharmacokinetic information. A variety of assay methods have been employed to characterise the pharmacokinetics of the ACE inhibitors, including enzymatic techniques, radioimmunoassay and chromatography. The peak plasma concentrations of the prodrugs are generally observed at around 1 hour and those of the diacid metabolites at about 2 to 4 hours. However, there is considerable variation within and between drugs, with benazepril and benazeprilat reaching peak concentrations early and enalapril and enalaprilat typical of later times to peak. Absorption of the active diacids is generally poor, and moderate (typically 30 to 70%) for the prodrugs. The bioavailability of lisinopril is about 25%. It is difficult to talk meaningfully about half-lives of the active drugs. The declines in their plasma concentrations are polyphasic and, if analytical sensitivity allows, active drug may be found at 48 hours or more following administration. This may reflect binding to ACE in plasma. Half-lives of accumulation are of the order of 12 hours; protein binding varies from little (lisinopril) to 90% (benazeprilat). Elimination is mostly renal but there may be biliary elimination for some, such as benazeprilat and fosinopril. The half-lives of the prodrugs are short. Impaired renal function decreases the elimination rate of the diacids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "410": "The overall prognosis for patients with congestive heart failure is poor. Defining specific populations that might demonstrate improved survival has been difficult.

All 11 patients were initially symptomatic with exertional dyspnea and fatigue for a minimum duration of 3 months. They form a subset of a larger group of 97 patients with chronic congestive heart failure that we have followed with sequential ejection fraction measurements. All 11 patients were treated with digitalis diuretics, and either converting-enzyme inhibitors or a combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine. Ten of the 11 patients had a history consistent with chronic alcoholism, and each reportedly abstained from alcohol during follow-up.",

    "415": "Platelet alpha-2-adrenergic receptor number and affinity were examined in 12 patients with class IV NYHA congestive heart failure (CHF) and 10 normal volunteers paired for age and sex. Platelet alpha-2-adrenergic receptor number is significantly decreased in CHF patients (178 +/- 18 fmol/mg prot. vs 282 +/- 21 fmol/mg prot. p less than 0.05). After Captopril treatment (6 weeks) alpha-2-receptor number increased but this increase was not statistically significant (236 +/- 28 fmol/mg prot.). This study supports the hypothesis that increased levels of circulating catecholamines in CHF lead to a decrease in platelet alpha-2-adrenoreceptors. Improved cardiac function following administration of Captopril could lead to a withdrawal of sympathetic tone. Captopril may also interact with sympathetic nervous function.", 
    "416": "The efficacy of captopril at 75 mg/day, atenolol at 100 mg/day and canrenoate potassium at 200 mg/day was compared in 42 essential hypertensive patients in randomly assigned sequences. All the drugs lowered blood pressure significantly but variations were found in the individual response. Patients who were more responsive to captopril also seemed to be more responsive to atenolol and vice versa (r = 0.75; P less than 0.0001), while the relationship between mean blood pressure reached after canrenoate potassium and that reached after atenolol or captopril was much weaker. The patients who were responsive to atenolol and captopril were considered as one group (n = 22) and compared with the 12 patients more responsive to canrenoate potassium. Before treatment, the former group had higher plasma renin activity (PRA) and lower Na,K cotransport activity across the erythrocyte membrane than the latter. These two variables, considered together as a discriminant function, correctly classified 92% of cases in the canrenoate potassium responder group and 73% of cases in the atenolol-captopril responders. These results raise the problem of individual assessment to obtain the most effective antihypertensive therapy and suggest that PRA and Na,K cotransport may be useful in predicting the individual response to antihypertensive drugs.",

Twenty-one subjects with essential hypertension were randomized into three groups of seven subjects each. In group I, the direct vascular vasodilator dihydralazine was administered at a dose of 4 micrograms/kg per min. Groups II and III received a continuous intravenous infusion of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindoprilat at a dose of 1 microgram/kg per min and 2.5 micrograms/kg per min, respectively. Brachial artery hemodynamics and aortic distensibility were evaluated non-invasively. Vascular reactivity was evaluated by the cold-pressor test. In all three groups, an identical decrease in blood pressure was observed (P less than 0.001), followed by a slight (but not significant) decrease in the heart rate in both perindoprilat groups, and an important tachycardia in the dihydralazine group (P less than 0.001). Brachial artery diameter was increased in the high-dose perindoprilate group from 0.437 +/- 0.014 to 0.479 +/- 0.013 cm (P less than 0.02), but remained unchanged in the two other groups. No significant changes in brachial artery mean blood velocity and blood flow were observed. In group III, aortic distensibility increased almost twice as much as in the two other groups, but this difference was not statistically significant.

Similar reductions in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were noted in the two treatment groups during treatment. Perhaps because of the limited number of patients, no between-group differences in the results of a measure of quality of life were found, but on overall assessments of treatment outcome by patients and the investigator, slightly better outcome was apparent in the ramipril-treated patients. No side effects or clinically significant changes in laboratory test results were reported. It is concluded that ramipril is a safe and effective agent in mild to moderate hypertension when administered as a single daily dose.",

The experiments were carried out in random order. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly reduced during ACE-inhibition (95 +/- 3 (+/- SE) vs 84 +/- 3 mmHg; p less than 0.02), while blood glucose control as assessed by HbA1c was unaltered (7.9 +/- 0.5 vs 7.6 +/- 0.5%). The night prior to the study normoglycaemia was maintained by a Biostator. A two-step hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (insulin infusion rate 0.3 and 0.8 mU kg-1 min-1) was followed by a hyperinsulinaemic and hyperglycaemic clamp (insulin infusion rate 0.8 mU kg-1 min-1, plasma glucose 11 mmol l-1). Insulin concentrations were comparable with and without enalapril treatment. During the hyperinsulinaemic clamps isotopically determined glucose disposal was unchanged (low dose 2.5 +/- 0.3, high dose 4.3 +/- 0.7 vs 2.6 +/- 0.3 and 4.3 +/- 0.7 mg kg-1 min-1, enalapril vs control). Glucose-induced glucose disposal (9.2 +/- 1.2 vs 9.1 +/- 1.2 mg kg-1 min-1) was also similar, as were non-protein respiratory exchange ratios (indirect calorimetry). Glucose production was not changed by enalapril. In conclusion, treatment with enalapril has no significant effect on glucose metabolism in Type 1 diabetes.", 
    "420": "A comparison was made of the vascular actions of two hormones having a renal site of action, angiotensin II and vasopressin, using laser Doppler flowmetry to measure perfusion of the cortical and papillary regions of the kidney. Angiotensin II infusion caused dose-related increases in blood pressure and reductions in cortical perfusion, the latter responses being potentiated in the presence of the converting enzyme inhibitor, cilazapril. However, angiotensin II had no effect on papillary perfusion either before or following cilazapril. The reasons for this differing vasoconstrictor ability of angiotensin II at the cortex and papilla are unclear, but it could be due to medullary generation of prostaglandin or bradykinin. Administration of equipressor doses of vasopressin caused graded reductions in both cortical and papillary perfusions, and subsequent cilazapril significantly enhanced the papillary responses. This study demonstrates that the regulation of blood flow through the different regions of the kidney can be differentially regulated by the peptide hormones angiotensin II and vasopressin.", 
    "421": "The effect of captopril treatment on left ventricular (LV) function, mass, and volume during chronic volume overload induced by production of aortic insufficiency (AI) was studied. AI was caused by mechanical disruption of the aortic valve in 175- to 225-g male Sprague-Dawley rats. At 24 h after surgery, AI and sham-operated rats were divided into control and captopril treatment (2 g/l drinking water) groups. After 2 mo of treatment, hemodynamics were measured in open-chest rats, and the LV pressure-volume relation was determined ex vivo. Compared with sham-operated rats, in the untreated AI rats, aortic pulse pressure was increased nearly 100%, LV end-diastolic pressure was 10 +/- 1 vs 3 +/- 1 mmHg, and LV end-diastolic volume was 1.25 +/- 0.07 vs 0.36 +/- 0.03 ml. LV weight was increased 43% and the LV pressure-volume relation was shifted rightward by AI. LV systolic and diastolic wall stress were increased in rats with AI. Peak LV pressure during aortic occlusion was decreased in AI rats, however, peak wall stress during aortic occlusion was not different compared with sham-operated rats. Captopril treatment decreased aortic pulse pressure and LV systolic pressure. Both LV weight and LV end-diastolic volume measured from the ex vivo pressure-volume relation at LV end-diastolic pressure were increased by 33% in untreated AI rats compared with captopril-treated AI rats. Captopril treatment of AI rats shifted the LV pressure-volume to the left compared with untreated rats. LV pressure and wall stress during aortic occlusion were not changed in captopril-treated AI rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "422": "Serum and mononuclear cell magnesium content were determined in a cross-sectional study performed in four groups of hypertensive patients on chronic treatment with atenolol (n = 11), enalapril (n = 10), thiazide diuretics (n = 12), or enalapril + thiazides (n = 11). Our study shows that in patients treated with the thiazides alone, in spite of normal serum potassium and magnesium levels, mononuclear cell magnesium was decreased. To the extent that mononuclear Mg content mirrors the body ion stores, our results indicate that thiazides induce a Mg depletion not detectable by monitoring serum levels.", 
    "423": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have had a significant impact on the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). Hemodynamic and clinical improvements in patients with severe CHF fostered the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in mild to moderate CHF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors produce acute and sustained improvements in ventricular hemodynamics and quality of life. Captopril plus diuretic therapy is an effective alternative to digoxin in patients with mild to moderate CHF. Enalapril maleate and lisinopril have been shown to be effective in moderate to severe CHF when combined with digoxin and diuretics. Captopril and enalapril also improve survival in selected patients; captopril attenuates left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. Although all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are similar in mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic differences impact their clinical use. Prolonged symptomatic hypotension compromising systemic perfusion and organ function has been reported with longer-acting agents; hypotension is usually short-lived and rarely compromises organ function with shorter-acting agents.", 
    "424": "Tolerance to the continuous intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin is thought to be largely the result of a decrease in vascular responsiveness, possibly due to intra-smooth muscle sulfhydryl group depletion. Another mechanism proposed to contribute to tolerance is nitroglycerin-induced reflex neurohumoral activation resulting in vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention. It has been proposed that the sulfhydryl group-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril may be useful in preventing tolerance to nitroglycerin by repleting sulfhydryl groups and by decreasing reflex neurohumoral activation. However, by decreasing renal perfusion pressure, the combination of captopril and nitrates could also lead to renal dysfunction. The objectives of this study were to determine whether captopril prevented or significantly reduced hemodynamic tolerance to a 72 h infusion of nitroglycerin, and to determine whether the combination of nitroglycerin and captopril caused deterioration of renal function. Nineteen patients with congestive heart failure received nitroglycerin (1.5 micrograms/kg/min) alone (n = 11) or in combination with oral captopril (63 +/- 8 mg/day) (n = 8). In both groups, partial hemodynamic tolerance developed within the first 24 h of nitroglycerin infusion. Nitroglycerin therapy, with or without captopril, did not affect plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, aldosterone or arginine vasopressin. However, plasma renin activity increased and atrial natriuretic peptide decreased in both groups, these changes being significant after 1 h of infusion but gradually returning towards baseline, in both groups, over the next 71 h. The nitroglycerin infusion did not alter body weight, urine output, creatinine clearance or fractional sodium excretion in either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "425": "The possible role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in preventing or minimizing tolerance to intravenous nitroglycerin in severe congestive heart failure (CHF) was studied by quantitating the degree of tolerance in 12 patients receiving nitroglycerin (group 1) and in 9 patients (group 2) receiving nitroglycerin and concurrent treatment with captopril (60 +/- 29 mg/day). At peak effect, nitroglycerin produced almost identical hemodynamic changes in both groups, with significant decreases in right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, systolic blood pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. Cardiac index increased. The extent of nitrate tolerance was calculated for each hemodynamic parameter as the percentage loss of the peak effect achieved by the drug. At 24 hours, 98 +/- 80% of the benefit achieved with respect to right atrial pressure was lost in group 1 and 61 +/- 74% in group 2 (group 1 vs 2, difference not significant). For pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, 51 +/- 31% (group 1) and 85 +/- 53% (group 2) (difference not significant) of the effect was lost, and for cardiac index, 53 +/- 58% (group 1) and 54 +/- 44% (group 2) (difference not significant). Tolerance was also almost identical regarding systolic blood pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Thus, the extent of tolerance to high-dose intravenous nitroglycerin in CHF was unaltered by administration of captopril, indicating that in clinical dosage, counter-regulatory neurohumoral mechanisms involving the renin-angiotensin system appear to be unimportant in its development.", 
    "426": "Benazepril (CGS 14824A HCl) is a new prodrug type angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The active form is considered to be benazeprilat, a diacid hydrolyzed compound. Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibited the contraction induced by exposure with angiotensin I, not angiotensin II, in the isolated rabbit aorta. The ACE inhibiting activity of benazeprilat was 1000 times more potent than that of benazepril in this experiment. Benazepril as well as benazeprilat and captopril exerted little influence on norepinephrine, serotonin and high K(+)-induced contraction or bradykinin-induced relaxation in isolated blood vessel preparations, thus angiotensin II synthesis inhibition seemed to be the main cause for its vasodilation. Benazepril, unlike benazeprilat or captopril showed considerable influence on prostaglandin (PG)-induced responses at higher concentrations. The vasocontraction induced by PGF2 alpha was competitively antagonized at 10(-5)-10(-4) mol/l, while vascular responses induced by PGE1, PGE2 or PGI2 was inhibited at 3 x 10(-4) mol/l of benazepril. Although these influences on PGs might not contribute much to its vasodilatory mechanism, the action seemed interesting in relation to cough induction, a known side effect of ACE inhibitors in the market. Benazepril has two asymmetric carbon atoms, thus four optical isomers are possible, SS (benazepril), SR (CGP 14'829A), RS (CGP 42'454A), RR (CGP 42'456A). The SS configuration was the most potent for antagonizing angiotensin I-induced vasocontraction, which seemed to be the best fitted for the ACE molecule.", 
    "427": "Because beta-adrenergic blockade has as one of its many effects altered electrophysiological abnormalities after dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy have been subjected to coronary occlusion, we tested the hypothesis that metoprolol (200-400 mg/day) would reduce mortality rates in dogs with one-kidney, one clip left ventricular hypertrophy while a similar reduction in arterial pressure with enalapril (20-40 mg/day) would not. Dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy were given metoprolol or enalapril for 5-7 days before a 3-hour coronary occlusion. Infarct size and risk area were measured with triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain and barium angiography, respectively. For control (n = 15), left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 17), left ventricular hypertrophy plus metoprolol (n = 12), and left ventricular hypertrophy plus enalapril (n = 15) groups, mean arterial pressure, ratio of infarct size to risk area, and dogs experiencing sudden death were 110 +/- 4, 142 +/- 4, 121 +/- 7, and 120 +/- 3 mm Hg; 44 +/- 5%, 65 +/- 5%, 44 +/- 7%, and 30 +/- 4%; and 27%, 65%, 17%, and 53%, respectively. Thus, the excessive increase in early mortality occurring when dogs with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy undergo coronary occlusion is interrupted with beta-blockade, possibly via electrophysiological effects rather than by changes in arterial pressure or infarct size.", 
    "428": "The influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (1 mg/kg orally in a single daily dose) on right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy was studied in Sprague Dawley rats. The pulmonary artery was banded to an outer diameter of 1.7 mm. After 14 days, left (LV) and RV hemodynamic parameters were measured in anesthetized animals. Furthermore, regional heart weights were determined, and myocytes of three different heart regions were isolated and subjected to morphometric analysis. Pulmonary artery stenosis caused a marked increase in RV systolic blood pressure (SBP) without alteration of LV functional parameters as compared with sham-operated animals. Correspondingly, the weight of the RV free wall as well as the RV cell volume were increased to about the same extent, while the LV weight was unchanged. Administration of ramipril to pulmonary artery-constricted animals slightly reduced LV SBP and LVdP/dtmax as compared with banded animals without treatment. The increase in RV SBP and the weight gain of the RV free wall were not affected, however. In contrast, the increase in cell volume of isolated myocytes was less pronounced in this group (+27% as compared with +58% in untreated animals). Because there were no differences in water content of the tissue, interstitial or cellular edema cannot be responsible for this discrepancy. Thus, ACE inhibition with ramipril appears to blunt the cellular hypertrophy in this model without affecting the weight gain of the RV.", 
    "429": "The effect of subfornical organ (SFO) lesion on various models of ingestive behaviour was investigated in rats. Intake of water after 24 h water deprivation or systemic administration of hypertonic NaCl were not altered by SFO lesions. Intake of food or water after 24 h of food deprivation were not altered by SFO lesions. Intake of NaCl after furosemide-induced Na depletion was decreased by ablation of the SFO. This decrease in Na intake was ameliorated by pretreatment with a low dose of captopril. These results suggest that the SFO is involved in Na intake after Na depletion, but not in water or food intake following periods of water or food deprivation, respectively. The observation that a low dose of captopril can eliminate the decrease in Na appetite which occurred subsequent to SFO lesion suggests that other brain areas may also participate in Na-depletion-induced Na appetite.", 
    "430": "The effect of antihypertensive therapy on regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular diastolic function was investigated in 25 hypertensive patients for up to 18 months after initiation of treatment. Left ventricular mass index was calculated by two-dimensional echocardiography and left ventricular diastolic function assessed by transmitral pulsed doppler ultrasound. Significant reduction in left ventricular mass index was observed after 9 months of treatment. Only 13 patients had a reduction in mass greater than the intraobserver variability of the technique. There was no change in doppler indices of left ventricular diastolic function. In 7 patients who were studied for a further 9 months after regression had occurred there was still no appreciable difference in left ventricular diastolic function. These findings indicate that there is no direct relation between left ventricular mass and abnormal left ventricular diastolic function.", 
    "431": "ACE-inhibitors have long been considered to be connected with only a few side-effects. Their use in clinical practice has shown that a considerable number of patients develop a dry, non-productive cough, resistant to treatment. The cause is hitherto unknown, but ACE-inhibition has been proved to alter the cough reflex. Non-smokers seem to cough more often than smokers, and females more often than males. Registration of side-effects in 28 patients treated for arterial hypertension in general practice in the years 1985-1988 is presented.", 
    "432": "Fulminating active rheumatic carditis has been observed for over three decades in this environment with no recent alteration in either the incidence or the pattern of presentation. Heart failure (in this context defined as 'an inadequate circulation at rest together with a raised pulmonary venous pressure, with or without an associated high systemic venous pressure in the absence of haemodynamically significant tricuspid valve disease or pericardial effusion') is prevalent but occurs only when a haemodynamically important left-sided valve lesion supervenes. Regurgitation is the predominant valve lesion and involves principally the mitral valve. Mitral annular dilatation is marked and predisposes to lengthening--or rupture--of chordae tendineae and prolapse of the anterior leaflet. The resultant cardiac work-overload apparently perpetuates or aggravates the rheumatic activity. Heart failure, as defined, whether caused by or associated with active rheumatic carditis, makes surgical management of the valve lesion mandatory as a life-saving measure. Aggressive medical therapy for heart failure, which should include vasodilator drugs and especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, provides temporary improvement only. Contrary to ongoing doctrine, treatment with steroid drugs in this context is neither life-saving nor beneficial.", 
    "433": "Although renin and angiotensin are still a puzzle, we are learning where some of the pieces fit. Recent studies indicate that in addition to ameliorating hypertension, ACE inhibitor therapy can prolong life in patients with severe congestive failure. Development of renin inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists may provide greater therapeutic specificity.", 
    "434": "A method for the quantitative measurement of captopril in human blood is described. Blood was immediately treated with N-ethylmaleimide to prevent oxidative degradation. The carboxyl moiety was derivatized to the pentafluorobenzyl ester, which shows excellent properties for negative-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. A stable isotope-labelled standard was prepared from the intact target molecule in quantitative yield by exchanging the oxygen atoms of the free carboxylic acid and the imide moiety against 18O. The detection limit under negative-ion chemical ionization conditions is ca. 100 times lower than under electron-impact or positive-ion chemical ionization conditions, therefore only very small amounts of the original sample have to be analysed. The method was applied to be quantitative determination of unchanged captopril in human plasma after oral administration of a 25-mg dose.", 
    "435": "Renal functional reserve capacity was evaluated in 19 normotensive type I diabetics without microalbuminuria. All patients had normal basal renal function as assessed by 24-hour creatinine clearances higher than 120 ml/min. PAH, inulin, and creatinine clearances were carried out every hour before, during, and after infusion of an amino acid (AA) solution. The same experiment was repeated after ACE inhibition with captopril (25 mg). Two groups of patients were found: Group A (responders) showed a significant rise in GFR after AA infusion (inulin clearances from 117 +/- 8 to 138 +/- 10 ml/min) (p less than 0.05), whereas in Group B (non-responders) no significant change in GFR was observed. Groups were comparable in age, duration of diabetes, metabolic control, and mean arterial blood pressure. Group B, however, had a significantly higher basal inulin clearance (167 +/- 17 ml/min) than Group A (117 +/- 8 ml/min). In Group A ACE inhibition completely blocked the AA-induced rise in GFR, while basal GFR in Group B was significantly reduced (167 +/- 17 to 148 +/- 8 ml/min) after captopril administration. In both groups renal plasma flow was enhanced by ACE inhibition. A rise in glucagon was observed in all patients during AA infusion. It is concluded that type I diabetics with normal basal renal function already have reduced (Group A) renal functional reserve capacity, which is completely abolished (Group B) when concomitant hyperfiltration occurs. ACE inhibition reduces hyperfiltration and is capable of blocking the AA-induced rise in GFR in these patients.", 
    "436": "The effect of the newly developed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, delapril hydrochrolide (CV-3317), on the release of immunoreactive angiotensin II (irAng II) from isolated rat hind legs was compared with that of captopril. Both ACE inhibitors, added to the perfusion medium (2 X 10(-9) - 10(-6) M), suppressed irAng II release in a dose-dependent manner, but the inhibition was greater with delapril than with captopril. The results provide further support for the concept that vascular tissues produce Ang II and release it in a regulated fashion. The results also suggest a possible link between the antihypertensive mechanism of ACE inhibitors, including delapril, and the suppression of vascular Ang II release.", 
    "437": "In brief When exercise alone does not NMM control hypertension, a medical ISMS regimen can be used in conjunction with exercise or other nonpharmacologic interventions. Diuretics, beta blockers, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are good choices for exercising patients because they do not limit exercise performance and have few side effects. The author gives guidelines for changing the regimen from exercise alone to exercise and medication, and for stepping down from medical therapy.", 
    "438": "The threshold for cough induced by inhaled tartaric acid was measured in 71 non-atopic healthy volunteers. The cough threshold was lower in women than in men, which may be relevant to previous reports that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors induce cough more frequently in women than in men.", 
    "439": "Camostat mesilate is a developed derivative of gabexate mesilate for oral administration and is known to be one of the most potent protease inhibitors. We administered this drug to 15 patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy at a daily dose of 600 mg for 4 to 6 weeks. All patients had been treated with conventional therapy including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and their diseases had stabilized for at least 2 weeks before the camostat mesilate therapy. Urinary protein excretion decreased promptly from 4.8 +/- 0.6 to 2.9 +/- 0.4 gm/day (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) and serum albumin level increased from 2.7 +/- 0.2 gm/dl to 2.9 +/- 0.2 gm/dl (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05) within 4 to 6 weeks. The amount of plasma fibrinogen significantly decreased from 419.7 +/- 42.3 mg/dl to 306.6 +/- 28.3 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01), and urinary total fibrinogen degradation product excretion over 24 hours also decreased from 26,118 +/- 9,696 to 18,072 +/- 7,107 micrograms/day (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05). The value for serum creatinine level did not change during this intervention. We suggest that camostat mesilate suppresses the hypercoagulable state originating from diabetes mellitus, and changes the permselectivity of the glomerular capillary wall. These effects of camostat mesilate may improve the prognosis of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "440": "In order to evaluate the incidence and the prognostic value of hyponatremia (hypoNa) in patients (pts) with severe chronic heart failure (SCHF), the authors studied 161 consecutive pts (113M, 48F ages sixty-seven +/- ten) with SCHF in NYHA class III-IV. The cause of SCHF was ischemic in 64 pts, hypertensive in 39, valvular in 14, alcohol-related in 3, and idiopathic in 41. Pretreatment hypoNa (less than 135 mmol/L) was found in 64/161 pts (40%) (Group I); Na+ was less than 125 in 10 pts, 125-130 in 19, and 131-135 mmol/L in 35; 42/64 pts (66%) of Group I were in NYHA class IV at admission. In the pts with pretreatment Na+ less than 125 mmol/L, hypoNa was persistent and refractory to high-dose furosemide (less than 500 mg/day) and water restriction. Cardiovascular mortality of Group I pts was 69% within twenty-four months (34 pts died of low-output syndrom and 10 suddenly). All pts with Na+ less than 130 mmol/L died within six months. The 20 pts who normalized Na+ are alive, and in NYHA class II-III (follow-up: twenty-six +/- fifteen, six to sixty months). Pts without hypoNa were 97/161 (Group II), and 58/97 (60%) are alive (follow-up: thirty +/- eighteen, five to fifty-eight months), whereas 39 pts died (27 suddenly, 9 of low-output syndrome, and 3 of extracardiac disease) within twenty-four months. The mortality rate of Group II was significantly lower (40% vs 69%, p less than 0.001) compared with Group I. The two groups were similar for age, sex, and cause and duration of SCHF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "441": "It has been established previously that nephrotic hyperlipidemia is characterized by both an increase in lipid synthesis and a defect in removal of lipoproteins. The relationship between these defects and altered albumin metabolism is uncertain. One hypothesis is that hepatic lipogenesis increases in parallel with albumin synthesis. To test this hypothesis, albumin synthesis was increased in nephrotic rats fed an 8.5% protein diet (LPN) by increasing dietary protein to 40% (HPN). Proteinuria was modulated in half of the rats fed 40% protein by enalapril (HPE). Albumin synthesis was the same in both HPN and HPE, but proteinuria was reduced in HPE compared to HPN, and so were serum cholesterol and triglycerides (TG). To examine the effect of serum albumin on lipid clearance in the absence of proteinuria, plasma clearance of chylomicrons (CM) and VLDL was measured in Nagase analbuminemic rats (NAR) and found to be no different than in normal SD rats. When proteinuria was induced in NAR and in SD rats, a severe and identical defect in both CM and VLDL clearance was acquired in both groups and blood lipid levels were increased to a similar degree in both groups. Neither hyperlipidemia nor defective removal of lipoproteins from the circulation are linked to albumin synthesis or serum albumin concentration but result, at least in part, from proteinuria. Postheparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was reduced slightly in nephrotic animals compared to nonnephrotic controls, but the most striking finding was a highly significant decrease in postheraprin LPL activity in normal NAR compared to SD rats (P less than 0.001), suggesting that reduced LPL activity is not responsible for reduced clearance of CM and VLDL in nephrotic rats.", 
    "442": "The administration of captopril (CP, 30 mg/kg) limited the arterial hypertension induced by the coarctation of the renal arteria and cardiac hypertrophy in rats. CP prevented the activation of MB-KK and glucoso-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Besides CP decreased the activity of pyruvate kinase and increased that of malate dehydrogenase. These data demonstrate, that CP prevents both the cardiac hypertrophy and metabolic changes in animals with the renal hypertension.", 
    "443": "We have previously demonstrated that Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ameliorates experimental systemic lupus erythematosus in inbred MRL lpr/lpr (MRL/l) mice. In contrast, Enalapril, another ACE inhibitor with antihypertensive properties but lacking a thiol group, did not show similar beneficial effects. To better understand the mode of action of captopril in the autoimmune disease we have evaluated its immunomodulatory properties with special emphasis on antigen-specific and polyclonal B- and T-cell activation. The results obtained strongly suggest that Captopril exerts its immunomodulatory effects through stimulation of T-lymphocytes.", 
    "444": "The content of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rats has proved abnormal, but the cause remained unknown. It was shown in the recent work that NE content in pons, posterior hypothalamus, nucleus caudatus and E concentration in medulla oblongata, anterior and posterior hypothalamus of 12-week old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were much higher than those of age-matched Wister-Kyoto rats (WKY). SHRSP also showed higher levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and brain angiotensin II (A II) than WKY. Intracerebroventricular (icv) perfusion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (20 micrograms for each time and three times for each day for four weeks) inhibited the synthesis of brain A II and reduced SBP and NE, E contents in all examined brain areas in SHRSP and WKY. However, the effects of chronically perfused captopril on SBP and brain NE, E levels in SHRSP were much more significant than in WKY. The results indicate that the modulatory effects of central renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on central adrenergic and noradrenergic system might be overactivated in SHRSP, which might partially responsible for the abnormally high levels of NE, E in some of the brain areas of SHRSP.", 
    "445": "Perindopril (P) is a prodrug whose active metabolite perindoprilat (PT) is an antihypertensive agent which acts by inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Anti-PT antiserum was produced in a rabbit immunized against PT that was covalently linked to bovine serum albumin. The radioligand is an iodinated (125I) derivative of PT-glycyltyrosinamide. Both the drug (PT) and the prodrug (P) are assayed in the same sample; PT is assayed as is and P is assayed after quantitative alkaline hydrolysis into PT. Certain data obtained from such assays suggest the occurrence in plasma and urine of a third immunoreactive component. A chromatographic fractionation of samples allowed us to isolate a new immunoreactive metabolite which was further identified as a glucuronide of PT (PT-G). Therefore, the whole assay was carried out as follows: biological samples were fractionated by stepwise chromatography on a anion-exchange resin (the first fraction contained P, the second contained PT, and the third contained PT-G); and RIA was performed on fractions 2 and 3 as is, and on fraction 1 after alkaline hydrolysis. Performances and assessments of this method are presented together with an example of a pharmacokinetic profile.", 
    "446": "A 55-year-old man developed renovascular hypertension that was characterized by high plasma renin activity. This was accompanied by nephrotic range proteinuria. Treatment with nifedipine and furosemide lowered the blood pressure to normal values, but proteinuria persisted. However, treatment with an ACE-inhibitor brought resolution of the proteinuria, suggesting a role for angiotensin II in urinary protein loss.", 
    "447": "Renin and catecholamine levels were determined in patients with mild to moderate hypertension before and after treatment with sustained release diltiazem or captopril and were correlated with the blood pressure response to these antihypertensives. Eight weeks of treatment with either agent led to equal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma norepinephrine did not predict the blood pressure response to either agent. Diltiazem significantly increased both PRA and supine norepinephrine levels. However, in the diltiazem treated patients, there was no correlation between the change in plasma norepinephrine and the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, there was a negative correlation (P less than .05) between the reactive rise in PRA and the decrease in systolic blood pressure. Thus, the antihypertensive response to a calcium channel blocker may be determined, in part, by the reactive response of pressor systems.", 
    "448": "The kidneys of five hypertensive dogs with experimental unilateral renal artery stenosis were examined by 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and 131I-hippuran radionuclide dynamic scintigraphy at 10 and 40 min (respectively) following the administration of intravenous bolus injections of captopril. Doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg captopril reduced mean arterial pressure by 33 +/- 4, 31 +/- 7, and 51 +/- 4 mm Hg and increased plasma renin activity by 40.1 +/- 9.8, 57.6 +/- 3.2, and 34.4 +/- 15.2 ng A1/mL/h, respectively. The time-activity curves of both 99mTc-DTPA and 131I-hippuran indicated that renal excretory function in the stenotic kidney was compromised with all three doses of captopril. However, if nitroprusside was used to reduce the mean arterial pressure to a level comparable to that with captopril, there was no appreciable increase in plasma renin activity and renal excretory function was only partially affected in the stenotic kidney. One hour after the administration of 0.5 mg/kg captopril, the function of the stenotic kidneys was partially restored and, by two hours, the time-activity curves were comparable to control scans. These data demonstrate a reversible, time-limited suppression of stenotic kidney function by captopril in renovascular hypertension and provide support for the use of captopril in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension by radionuclide dynamic scintigraphy.", 
    "449": "1. The metabolism of perindopril (non-thiol angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was studied in rat, dog and monkey after single oral and i.v. administration of 14C-perindopril, and in man after a single oral dose. 2. Six biotransformation products of perindopril from urine, faecal and plasma samples (bile only for rats) were identified. 3. The main route of biotransformation in all species is the hydrolysis of the carboxylic ethyl ester side-chain, with the formation of perindoprilate, the active metabolite. 4. A minor route of biotransformation led to the acyl glucuronides of perindopril and perindoprilate. 5. Internal dehydration of perindopril and perindoprilate into cyclic lactam structures occurs. This route of metabolism is of minor importance except in humans."
