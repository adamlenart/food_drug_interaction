    "1": "Immunological mediators are increasingly recognized to play a pathogenic role in the pathophysiology of CHF. Whether ACE inhibitor therapy modifies immunological variables has not previously been investigated.", 
    "2": "Seventy-five patients (mean age 52 +/- 11 years) with CHF were randomized between low-(5 m g daily) and high-dose (40 mg daily) enalapril in a double-blind trial. Circulating levels of immunological parameters (i.e., proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules) were measured at baseline, at 10 weeks and at the end of the study (34 weeks).", 
    "3": "All immunological parameters, except soluble interleukin (IL)-6 receptor, were increased in CHF compared with 21 healthy controls. During the study immunoreactive IL-6 levels decreased (p < 0.05) and soluble IL-6 receptor increased (p < 0.05) during high-dose but not during low-dose enalapril therapy. Furthermore, IL-6 bioactivity decreased only during the high-dose (p < 0.001), resulting in a significant difference in change during treatment between the two dosage groups (p < 0.001). This decrease in IL-6 bioactivity was significantly associated with decreased interventricular septum thickness as assessed by echocardiography (r = 0.56, p = 0.013). No other variables changed during treatment.", 
    "4": "In patients with severe CHF, high-dose enalapril therapy is associated with a significant decrease in IL-6 activity. However, despite treatment with a high-dose ACE inhibitor, a persistent immune activation exists in these patients which may be of importance for the progression of CHF.", 
    "5": "The treatment of hypertension and heart failure has evolved in recent years. It may no longer be sufficient to lower blood pressure per se or correct hemodynamics alone in these conditions to achieve optimal long-term outcomes; rather, the effects of drugs on the cellular events and structural alterations that occur in the vasculature, heart, and kidney must be considered. Drugs that target angiotensin II, which include the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), may protect target organs from damage and thereby improve outcomes. Nevertheless, it remains to be demonstrated whether these agents are more effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients than conventional treatment with diuretics and beta blockers. In certain subgroups of hypertensive patients, including those with heart failure, type 1 diabetes with proteinuria, or after myocardial infarction with systolic dysfunction, there is compelling evidence for use of ACE inhibitors. The results from animal models and initial clinical studies suggest that ARBs are also highly effective in these patients. Several large-scale clinical studies, comparing the effect of ARBs and other drug classes on morbidity and mortality outcomes, have been initiated to better define the long-term benefit of ARBs in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.", 
    "6": "Several angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), including candesartan cilexetil, irbesartan, losartan, telmisartan, and valsartan, are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with hypertension. These agents share a common mechanism of action-antagonism of the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor-and as a result, they block a number of angiotensin II effects that are relevant to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease, including vasoconstriction, renal sodium reabsorption, aldosterone and vasopressin secretion, sympathetic activation, and vascular and cardiac hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Unlike the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, these new drugs block the effects of angiotensin II regardless of whether it is produced systemically in the circulation or locally via ACE- or non-ACE-dependent pathways in tissues. ARBs also block the angiotensin II-induced feedback regulation of renin release, resulting in an increase in angiotensin II levels. With the AT1 receptor blocked, angiotensin II is available to activate the angiotensin type 2 (AT2) receptor, which mediates several potentially beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system, including vasodilation, antiproliferation, and apoptosis. Thus, ARBs provide a highly selective approach for regulating the effects of angiotensin II.", 
    "7": "Valsartan (Diovan) is an antihypertensive drug belonging to the family of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. At a dose of 40 mg/d, its antihypertensive effect is inconsistent. At 80 mg/d its effect on blood pressure, its adverse effects, and its contraindications (mainly pregnancy and renal artery stenosis) are similar to those of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, except that coughing is rarer with valsartan than with ACE inhibitors. Valsartan has no demonstrated advantage over losartan, another angiotensin II antagonist. Valsartan has not been shown to prevent complications of arterial hypertension, and its use is, therefore, less well validated than that of diuretics and beta-blockers.", 
    "8": "Urticaria and angioedema may be elicited by a considerable number of drugs, particularly nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, radiocontrast media and antibiotics. Pathogenic mechanisms involved include pseudoallergy, idiosyncrasy and IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, occasionally also IgG antibodies. In this survey the common problems which still lack established diagnostic in vitro tests such as pseudoallergic reactions to analgesic drugs and idiosyncratic side effects to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors are presented. In addition some examples of drugs are given where, due to progress in research, instead of a pseudoallergic mechanism an immunological pathogenesis could be demonstrated.", 
    "9": "We generated transgenic mice with two P1 artificial chromosomes, each containing the human renin (HREN) gene and extending to -35 and -75 kilobase pairs, respectively. HREN protein production was restricted to juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, and its expression was tightly regulated by angiotensin II and sodium. The magnitude of the up- and down-regulation in HREN mRNA caused by the stimuli tested was identical to the endogenous renin gene, suggesting tight physiological regulation. P1 artificial chromosome mice were mated with transgenic mice overexpressing human angiotensinogen to determine if there was a chronic compensatory down-regulation of the transgene. Despite a 3-fold down-regulation of HREN mRNA, plasma angiotensin II and blood pressure was modestly elevated in the double transgenic mice. Nevertheless, this elevation was significantly less than a different double transgenic model containing a poorly regulated HREN transgene. The increase in blood pressure, despite the decrease in HREN mRNA, suggests that the HREN gene can partially, but not completely, compensate for excess circulating angiotensinogen. These data suggest the possibility that increases in circulating or tissue angiotensinogen may cause an increase in blood pressure in humans, even in the presence of a functionally active servo-mechanism to down-regulate HREN expression.", 
    "10": "Determination of urinary free catecholamine and total (i. e., free plus conjugated) metanephrine excretion is considered the most clinically sensitive biochemical test for pheochromocytoma. In this study, we evaluated new immunoassay methods for the measurement of these analytes for potential drug-based interference.", 
    "11": "Urine samples collected from patients on a variety of medications were grouped by specific drug type. The significance of any difference in the free catecholamine or total metanephrine concentrations in the different groups was assessed by one-way ANOVA. A group of patients receiving no medication was included as a control (no analytical interference). Additionally, analytical accuracy, detection limit, and precision were determined.", 
    "12": "No significant differences were found in the concentrations of free catecholamines or total metanephrines in urine from patients taking the medications investigated and the control group: P = 0.649 (fE), 0.221 (fNE), 0.149 (tM), and 0.170 (tNM). For free catecholamines, intraassay CVs were 4.6-18%; interassay CVs were 10-25%. For total metanephrines, intraassay CVs were 9.6-27%; interassay CVs were 5. 8-22%. Detection limits were 0.009 and 0.027 micromol/L for fE and fNE and 0.119 and 0.346 micromol/L for tM and tNM, respectively.", 
    "13": "None of the drugs examined in this study interfered in the measurement of free catecholamines or total metanephrines by these immunoassays. The technique is easier to use, requires less equipment, and is more accessible than HPLC. In combination, these assays are suitable as initial screening tests for pheochromocytoma.", 
    "14": "The wide variety of first-line agents available for managing high blood pressure include diuretics, beta adrenergic receptor blockers, alpha adrenergic receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. Supplemental agents used for second-line therapy and special indications, such as pregnancy and hypertensive emergencies, include angiotensin receptor blockers, central-acting agents, direct vasodilators, and adrenergic neuron inhibitors. Selection of agents for particular patients requires consideration of research-based evidence for positive long-term outcomes and of the unique patient profile of age, race, co-morbidities, and lifestyle. A thorough understanding of the pharmacology (mechanism, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects and drug interactions, clinical use) of antihypertensive agents is an essential foundation for nursing practice in women's health.", 
    "15": "To test the hypothesis that local administration of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor via a microporous balloon catheter would be more effective than oral administration of ACE inhibitor in preventing neointima formation after balloon angioplasty.", 
    "16": "Neointima formation was induced by balloon denudation followed by 0.5% cholesterol diet in 29 New Zealand White rabbits. Directly after denudation, local administration of 1.8 mg of ramiprilat (n = 7) or saline (n = 7) with a microporous balloon catheter at a pressure of 3 atm was performed. Both groups additionally received ramipril orally (1 mg/d). Seven animals were treated exclusively with oral ramipril. The control group was fed a 0.5% cholesterol diet and given no medication (n = 8). Six weeks after intervention, the animals were killed and morphometric and immunohistologic analyses were performed.", 
    "17": "Oral administration of ramipril resulted in a significant reduction of placque area (-66%, P < .05). Oral and local administration of the ACE inhibitor was followed by a nonsignificant reduction of the neointimal area (-17%). Local administration of saline combined with oral ramipril failed to prevent neointimal formation (reduction of 6%, NS).", 
    "18": "Oral administration of ramipril resulted in a significant reduction of neointimal proliferation in New Zealand White rabbits. The possible benefit of an additional administration of local ramiprilat was diminished by an excessive neointimal hyperplasia, which was most likely caused by the inherent vessel trauma with use of the microporous balloon catheter.", 
    "19": "The serum levels of the catabolic cytokine TNF-alpha are often raised in malnourished chronic heart failure patients as well as in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often used in these patients and may decrease TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to find out whether CRF patients with ongoing ACE-inhibitor treatment have lower TNF-alpha levels.",

No significant difference in TNF-alpha levels were observed when comparing patients with or without treatment with beta, calcium channel, or AII receptor blockers, respectively.", 
    "25": "The present data suggest that the use of ACE-inhibitors is associated with lower plasma TNF-alpha and CRP levels as well as a lower prevalence of malnutrition in patients with advanced CRF. Further studies are needed to establish if there is a casual relationship between these findings and, if so, the molecular mechanism(s).", 
    "26": "Capillary leakage of sodium-fluorescein (NaF) in the skin reflects capillary permeability and may be a marker of diabetes-associated microcirculatory abnormalities.", 
    "27": "We evaluated transcapillary skin NaF leakage by fluorescence videodensitometry in 10 normoalbuminuric, 10 microalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic men (diabetes duration > 10 years) and 10 healthy subjects. The microalbuminuric patients were restudied after 6 weeks treatment with the ACE-inhibitor enalapril, 10 mg once daily. All measurements were performed at a blood glucose level of 5 mmol L-1.", 
    "28": "Transcapillary NaF leakage was strongly increased in normoalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic patients compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.001) and was still further increased in microalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic patients (P < 0.01 compared to normoalbuminuric patients). Enalapril reduced NaF leakage (P < 0.05), mean arterial blood pressure (P < 0.05) and microalbuminuria (P < 0. 05). After treatment, NaF leakage was not different from that in normoalbuminuric patients.", 
    "29": "Capillary permeability, as determined by NaF leakage, is elevated in normoalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic patients with long-standing disease, and the excess elevation in microalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic patients is ameliorated by ACE-inhibition. Skin NaF videodensitometry seems a useful tool to document capillary permeability in intervention studies.", 
    "30": "A number of animal studies and our own clinical trials point towards a possible influence of the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) on erythropoietin (EPO) production. In this study we investigated the role of angiotensin II in the regulation of EPO production in humans.", 
    "31": "After a hemorrhage of 750 ml as a basic physiological stimulus 72 healthy male volunteers received in a parallel design either placebo (physiologic electrolyte solution) for 6 h, angiotensin II i.v. for 6 h (1-3 microgram min-1, sufficient to increase systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg), the selective AT1-receptor antagonist losartan, the ACE-inhibitor captopril, angiotensin II + losartan, or angiotensin II + captopril.", 
    "32": "Administration of angiotensin II alone and in combination with captopril resulted in a significantly higher Cmax EPO (67% higher vs. placebo, P < 0.05) and AUCEPO (0-24h) (40% higher vs. placebo, P < 0.05). In the groups receiving losartan or captopril alone or the combination of angiotensin II + losartan no significant difference of Cmax EPO and AUCEPO(0-24h) compared to placebo could be detected.", 
    "33": "This study shows in a model of controlled, basic physiological stimulation of renal EPO production that angiotensin II is able to increase EPO levels in humans. This effect of angiotensin II can be blocked by the specific AT1-receptor antagonist losartan but not by the ACE-inhibitor captopril. The result may be interpreted as a hint that one signal for the control of EPO production in humans may be mediated by angiotensin II (AT1)-receptors.",

    "38": "The performance of the experimental paradigm of angiotensin challenges with continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurement was evaluated. Angiotensin dose-response relationships were characterized, along with the influence of clinical covariates. The stability of angiotensin-induced peaks and the variability of the angiotensin doses were assessed. Finally, the predictive value of studies based on angiotensin challenges to determine drug doses effective in therapeutics was evaluated.", 
    "39": "The data were gathered from 13 clinical studies on nine angiotensin II receptor antagonists, one ACE inhibitor and one dual ACE-NEP inhibitor, using Finapres for measuring the response to exogenous angiotensin challenges. Modelling of angiotensin dose-response curves and determination of the inter and intrasubject variability were performed by nonlinear regression (NONMEM). The different sources of variations in angiotensin I and II doses and angiotensin-induced peaks were evaluated by analyses of variance. The dose of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists inhibiting blood pressure increase by at least 75%, as measured by this method, was chosen for comparison with the labelled starting dose.", 
    "40": "Angiotensin challenges exhibited a clear dose-response relationship which can be characterized both by an Emax or a log linear model. The log linear model gave an average systolic/diastolic response of 24+/-6/20+/-5 mmHg for a unit dose of 1 microgram of angiotensin II equivalents, and an increase of 6/6 mmHg for each doubling of the dose. The angiotensin ED50 calculated values were 0.67 microgram for systolic and 0.84 microgram for diastolic blood pressure. The angiotensin doses for eliciting a given response and the angiotensin induced peaks were fairly constant between period and subject, but vary significantly between studies. Based on an inhibition of blood pressure by 75%, the agreement was good between the doses of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists predicted from studies using the methodology of angiotensin challenges and the doses shown to be clinically efficacious, in spite of high intersubject and intrasubject variabilities.", 
    "41": "This experimental method represents a valid surrogate for the therapeutic target and a useful tool for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiling of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "42": "Continuous noninvasive blood pressure measurement by photoplethysmography has been regularly used in the experimental paradigm of angiotensin challenges, applied to the phase I clinical testing of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. This work aims to evaluate the performance of this measurement method, in terms of reliability, reproducibility and dependence on technical settings.", 
    "43": "Data have been gathered from 13 clinical studies on antihypertensive drugs, using the Finapres device for measuring the response to exogenous angiotensin challenges.

    "44": "The relative precision of blood pressure monitoring by photoplethysmography allows reproducible determination of angiotensin-induced blood pressure peaks (agreement limits for systolic and diastolic peaks: 12 and 6 mmHg respectively). The reading method influences the results to a similar extent. As compared with blood pressure measured intra-arterially, the difference is usually within limits of clinical acceptability.",

The impact of selected changes in the settings and reading methods is limited.", 
    "46": "1. We visualized the changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), using fluo-3 as an indicator, in individual smooth muscle cells within intact rat tail artery preparations. 2. On average in about 45 % of the vascular smooth muscle cells we found spontaneous Ca2+ waves and oscillations ( approximately 0.13 Hz), which we refer to here as Ca2+ ripples because the peak amplitude of [Ca2+]i was about one-seventh of that of Ca2+ oscillations evoked by noradrenaline. 3. We also found another pattern of spontaneous Ca2+ transients often in groups of two to three cells. They were rarely observed and are referred to as Ca2+ flashes because their peak amplitude was nearly twice as large as that in noradrenaline-evoked responses. 4. Sympathetic nerve activity was not considered responsible for the Ca2+ ripples, and they were abolished by inhibitors of either the Ca2+ pump in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (cyclopiazonic acid) or phospholipase C (U-73122). 5. Both angiotensin antagonists ([Sar1,Ile8]-angiotensin II and losartan) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) inhibited the Ca2+ ripples. 6. The extracellular Ca2+-dependent tension borne by unstimulated arterial rings was reduced by the angiotensin antagonist by approximately 50 %. 7. These results indicate that the Ca2+ ripples are generated via inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores in response to locally produced angiotensin II, which contributes to the maintenance of vascular tone.", 
    "47": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are known to inhibit the progression of established renal failure. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of an ACEI and an AT1 receptor antagonist (AT1R-Ant) in preventing the development of renal disease, at an early stage of hypertensive nephrosclerosis. SHRSP/Izm rats (n = 61) were treated from 10 wk until 22 wk with the ACEI delapril (40 mg/kg/d) or the AT1R-Ant candesartan cilexetil (1 mg/kg/d). Proteinuria, and structural/ultrastructural changes were assessed at 14 and 22 wk. Treatment with either agent resulted in reductions in blood pressure and cardiovascular hypertrophy. Neither proteinuria nor major renal histological changes were evident at 14 wk. At 22 wk, however, proteinuria accompanied by nephrosclerotic changes was seen in the untreated SHRSP/Izm. Treatment with either ACEI or AT1R-Ant resulted in similar reductions in proteinuria (untreated, 32.2 +/- 7.4; delapril-treated, 5.5 +/- 1.2; candesartan-treated, 3.9 +/- 0.3 mg/100 g/d). Prominent sclerosis of small-to-medium sized renal arteries was seen in the untreated SHRSP/Izm at 22 wk, but was similarly attenuated by the ACEI and AT1R-Ant. The glomerular ultrastructure was comparable between the two groups. No significant changes in renal AT1a or AT1b receptor subtype mRNA expression were seen throughout the course of the study. In contrast, a decrease in AT2 receptor mRNA was seen in the drug-treated groups at 14 wk but not at 22 wk. These results suggest that both ACEI and AT1R-Ant have similar efficacy in attenuating the onset of renal injury in early hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and that treatment with either agent is associated with a transient decrease in AT2 receptor mRNA expression.", 
    "48": "Chronic inhibition of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) with enalapril, results in a phenotypic change of the medial cells of renal afferent arterioles from contractile smooth muscle cells to renin containing epithelioid cells. In normal animals, the density of the innervation of the juxtaglomerular renin containing epithelioid cells is much lower compared to the contractile cells. The effector tissues are known to play an important role in determining the pattern and density of their innervation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the density of the innervation of the afferent arteriole smooth muscle cells decreases when they change their phenotype from contractile to renin containing epithelioid cells. The results show that the density of the innervation had significantly increased and the association of the terminals with the smooth muscle cells had changed. There were significantly more varicosities around renal afferent arterioles from rabbits treated with enalapril (10 microg/kg/h) for 6 weeks (mean +/- SEM = 634 +/- 175 x 10(3)/mm2 vessel surface, cf. 329 +/- 69 x 10(3)/mm2 vessel surface in untreated rabbits, P = 0.05), with the number of neuroeffector junctions remaining the same (124 +/- 14 and 164 +/- 32 x 10(3)/mm2 vessel surface) and significantly more non-contacting varicosities (i.e. lying > 100 nm from the medial cells) (74 +/- 5% and 25 +/- 7%, respectively; P = 0.003). Thus, there was no reduction in the innervation of afferent arterioles in which the smooth muscle cells had changed phenotype in response to enalapril treatment as hypothesised. Instead, it would appear that proliferation of the innervation had occurred, with the formation of additional varicosities but these varicosities failed to form neuromuscular junctions. This study has identified a form of neural plasticity in the kidney that has not previously been described.", 
    "49": "Three recent studies that have focused on the discontinuation of initial antihypertensive medications are reviewed. The studies reviewed indicate that newly prescribed antihypertensive medications are associated with high levels of discontinuation in the months following the initiation of treatment. After six months, less than 50% of patients are on initial treatment regardless of which of the following classes of medication has been prescribed: diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A higher proportion of patients on losartan than on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors continue their initial treatment after 12 months. More research designed to assess the effectiveness of treatments in real life situations is needed. In particular, there is a need to clarify the role of side effects on continuation of initial treatment.", 
    "50": "Angiotensin II plays a significant role in cell growth and proliferation in model systems and in humans. In addition, angiotensin II appears to facilitate sympathetic activation and the release of endothelin-1, and also to promote apoptosis. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has provided beneficial effects on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) regression and on cardiac remodelling in the presence of heart failure. Data from experimental models as well as studies in humans suggest that the increase of bradykinin mediated by ACE inhibitors provides most of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors. The new class of angiotensin receptor blocker appears to provide cardioprotective effects that are similar to those of the ACE inhibitors. Most of the beneficial effects provided by these agents appear to be related to a more complete blockade of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor. However, costimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor appears to increase nitric oxide and thus to cause some bradykinin-like effects. Evidence for the role of angiotensin II in promoting LVH and cardiac failure as well as for abnormal regulations of the angiotensin signal transduction pathways in model systems and in humans are reviewed. Second, the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of angiotensin II modulation by ACE inhibitors versus angiotensin II antagonists studied in model systems are presented. Finally, results from pivotal phase II studies such as Evaluation of Losartan In The Elderly (ELITE), as well as an overview of the ongoing phase III trials involving the use of ARB in high risk patients are presented.",

Following a 4-week wash-out period and a 4-week period of monotherapy with P (4 mg/daily), IND (2.5 mg/daily) or HCT (25 mg/daily) was added for 4 weeks. Selection of the diuretic agent was random. Following a 4-week wash-out period from the diuretic, in which only P was given, the alternative diuretic was administered for another period of 4 weeks. P decreased blood pressure levels significantly. However, the drug was more efficacious in patients with higher plasma renin activity (PRA). Combination treatment induced an additional decrease in the blood pressure levels, mainly in patients with lower PRA. The combination of P + HCT was more effective than the combination P + IND. The addition of either HCT or IND evoked a small but statistically significant increase in serum glucose levels while fasting as well as during the 75 g oral glucose challenge. However, insulin levels did not change significantly during the study. Small but not statistically significant changes in serum electrolytes and lipid parameters were observed during the various phases of the study, while a statistically significant increase in the serum uric acid was noticed when the combination P + HCT was given. We conclude: (1) P in small doses is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent, (2) PRA has a predictive value in determining the effectiveness of P treatment, (3) the combination of P with small doses of HCT or IND is more efficacious than P alone, (4) the combination treatment has adverse effects in the carbohydrate tolerance, while there are not significant changes in serum electrolyte and lipid parameters.",

Systolic blood pressure was elevated in young SHR (130+/-2 mm Hg) compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (106+/-2 mm Hg). In adult SHR, the rise in systolic blood pressure (44+/-3 mm Hg) was blunted by fosinopril (18+/-1 mm Hg) and irbesartan (9+/-3 mm Hg). Lumen diameter of mesenteric resistance arteries was smaller and media/lumen ratio was greater in young and adult SHR versus WKY rats. Growth index was 24% in untreated adult SHR versus WKY rats; these values were -35% for fosinopril-treated and -29% for irbesartan-treated SHR versus untreated SHR. Isobaric wall stiffness was normal despite increased stiffness of wall components in adult SHR vessels. Irbesartan partially prevented stiffening of wall components in SHR. The collagen/elastin ratio was greater in adult SHR vessels (6.5+/-1.3) than in WKY (3.2+/-0.4) vessels. Expression of alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1) integrins was increased in SHR aged 20 versus 6 weeks. Expression of alpha(5)beta(1) integrins was lower in young SHR, and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins were overexpressed in adult SHR versus WKY rats.

Compared with screening for microalbuminuria, treating all patients was more expensive ($15240 and $14940 per patient) but was associated with increased quality-adjusted life expectancy (11.82 and 11.78 quality-adjusted life-years). The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio was $7500 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.", 
    "65": "Results were sensitive to the cost, effectiveness, and quality of life associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, as well as age at diagnosis. The model was relatively insensitive to adherence with screening and costs of treating end-stage renal disease.", 
    "66": "Treating all middle-aged diabetic patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a simple strategy that provides additional benefit at modest additional cost. The strategy assumes that patients meet the older diagnostic criteria for diabetes and makes sense only for those who are not bothered by treatment.",

    "68": "Hispanics are the fastest growing and second largest minority in the U.S. but most cardiovascular disease data on Hispanics has been derived from retrospective studies and vital statistics. Despite their higher cardiovascular risk-factor profile, better outcomes after MI have been reported in Hispanics.", 
    "69": "We studied the baseline characteristics, resource use and outcomes of 734 Hispanics and 27,054 non-Hispanics treated for MI in the GUSTO-I and -III trials. The primary end point of both trials was 30-day mortality.", 
    "70": "Hispanics were younger, shorter, lighter and more often diabetic and began thrombolysis 9 min later, compared with non-Hispanics. Measures of socioeconomic status (educational level, employment and health insurance) were lower among Hispanics. Fewer Hispanics than non-Hispanics underwent in-hospital angiography (70% vs. 74%, p = 0.013) or bypass surgery (11% vs. 13.5%, p = 0.04). Hispanics received more angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and less calcium-channel blockers, prophylactic lidocaine and inotropic agents. Mortality at 30 days and at one year did not differ significantly between Hispanics and non-Hispanics (6.4% vs. 6.7% and 9.0% vs. 9.7%, respectively). We noted no interactions between thrombolytic strategy and Hispanic status on major outcomes (30-day death, stroke and major bleeding).", 
    "71": "The care of Hispanics with MI differed slightly from that of non-Hispanics. Nevertheless, these differences in care did not affect long-term outcomes.",

    "73": "Fifty ambulatory patients, 18 to 75 years of age, with mild to moderate heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction </=35%, taking stable doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, diuretics, and optionally digoxin were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study of ecadotril 50 to 400 mg twice daily versus conventional therapy alone.", 
    "74": "No increases in deaths, serious adverse events, or dropouts from adverse events were observed for the ecadotril group compared with placebo. The serum measures of neurohormonal activation were highly variable. Changes in signs and symptoms of heart failure, New York Heart Association class, and patient self-assessment of symptoms were not observed with ecadotril therapy; however, the study was not designed to detect differences in these parameters.", 
    "75": "In this small pilot study, ecadotril in doses of 50 to 400 mg twice daily was generally well-tolerated and without severe short-term adverse effects in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Evaluation of the clinical efficacy and long-term safety of ecadotril and other neutral endopeptidase inhibitors in patients with heart failure requires further study.", 
    "76": "Most patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) receive the same dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors because there is currently no measure of treatment efficacy. We sought to determine whether titration of vasodilator therapy according to plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration may be of value in the individual optimization of vasodilator therapy in CHF.", 
    "77": "Twenty patients with mild to moderate CHF receiving stable conventional therapy including an ACE inhibitor were randomly assigned to titration of ACE inhibitor dosage according to serial measurement of plasma BNP concentration (BNP group) or optimal empirical ACE inhibitor therapy (clinical group) for 8 weeks. Only the BNP-driven approach was associated with significant reductions in plasma BNP concentration throughout the duration of the study and a significantly greater suppression when compared with empiric therapy after 4 weeks [-42.1% (-58.2, -19.7) vs -12.0% (-31.8, 13.8), P =.03]. Both treatment strategies were well tolerated and associated with favorable neurohormonal and hemodynamic effects; however, in comparison between groups, mean heart rate fell (P =.02) and plasma renin activity rose (P =.03) in the BNP group when compared with the clinical group.", 
    "78": "Plasma BNP concentration may be chronically reduced by tailored vasodilator therapy in CHF. Furthermore, titration of vasodilator therapy according to plasma BNP was associated with more profound inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and significant fall in heart rate when compared with empiric therapy.",

    "80": "The present study examined the role of intrarenal bradykinin in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced dilation of renal afferent (AFF) and efferent arterioles (EFF) in vivo, and further evaluated whether ACEI-stimulated bradykinin activity differed in superficial (SP) and juxtamedullary nephrons (JM). Arterioles of canine kidneys were visualized with an intravital charge-coupled device camera microscope. E4177 (an angiotensin receptor antagonist, 30 microg/kg) dilated AFF and EFF in SP (15 +/- 3% and 19 +/- 5%) and JM (15 +/- 3% and 18 +/- 4%). Subsequently, cilazaprilat (30 microg/kg) caused further dilation of both AFF (29 +/- 4%) and EFF (36 +/- 4%) in JM, whereas in SP it dilated only EFF (29 +/-3%). Similarly, in the presence of E4177, cilazaprilat caused further increases in sodium excretion. This cilazaprilat-induced vasodilation and natriuresis was abolished by a bradykinin antagonist (N(alpha)-adamantaneacetyl-D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]b radykinin). In parallel with these results, cilazaprilat increased renal bradykinin content, more greatly in the medulla than in the cortex (5.7 +/- 0.4 versus 4.6 +/- 0.1 ng/g). Similarly, cilazaprilat elicited greater bradykinin-dependent increases of nitrite/nitrate in the medulla. In conclusion, zonal heterogeneity in renal bradykinin/nitric oxide levels and segmental differences in reactivity to bradykinin contribute to the diverse responsiveness of renal AFF and EFF to ACEI. ACEI-enhanced kinin action would participate in the amelioration of glomerular hemodynamics and renal sodium excretion by ACEI.", 
    "81": "We studied the effects of aminoguanidine (AG), beta-resorcylidene aminoguanidine (RAG), DL-penicillamine (PNCA) and captopril on early and advanced glycation of human serum albumin (HSA). We also assessed inhibition of lipid peroxidation by AG and RAG in erythrocytes. Incubation of HSA with D-glucose (20 mM, 37 degrees C for 21 days) led to the formation of Amadori products and fluorescent advanced glycation end-products (AGE). Only PNCA markedly reduced the formation of Amadori products, while all tested compounds markedly reduced the formation of AGE. AG and RAG also inhibited malondialdehyde formation in erythrocytes incubated with hydrogen peroxide. Addition of AG at concentrations from 1 microM to 1 mM caused a 10-80% inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Thus, AG and RAG inhibit toxic oxidative processes and may have therapeutic potential in a number of human diseases.", 
    "82": "Although the outcome of renal transplantation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been studied, there are few reports about the outcome of patients with systemic sclerosis who have undergone renal transplantation. We retrospectively collected data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Scientific Renal Transplant Registry from a 10-year period. From 1987 to 1997, 86 patients with systemic sclerosis who had renal transplantation were identified. Of these 86 patients, 70% were women, 86% were Caucasian, and the mean age at transplantation was 50.4 years. The overall mortality was 24% of the patient group; 44% (38/86) of renal grafts failed. First- through fifth-year graft survival rates were 62%, 60%, 57%, 50%, and 47%, respectively. The causes of graft failure could not be ascertained in 24 of 38 patients (63%). Among the known causes, 5 had acute rejection, 4 had chronic rejection, 3 had recurrence of scleroderma, and 1 each had infection and graft thrombosis. Immunosuppressive regimens used in the patients with systemic sclerosis consisted of antilymphocyte globulin in at least 25%. Sixty percent received a combination of steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. The use of cyclosporine was not associated with either improvement of graft survival or an increased rate of graft failure. Graft survival at 5 years in patients with systemic sclerosis was comparable to that of patients with SLE who received renal transplantation, according to existent medical literature. Based upon these data, renal transplantation is as effective a treatment for restoring renal function in patients with systemic sclerosis as it is in patients with SLE. Those patients with systemic sclerosis whose renal function did not improve with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor treatments after scleroderma renal crisis should be considered as transplant candidates. Although the data are incomplete, the use of cyclosporine may not confer the advantage of improving graft survival in patients with systemic sclerosis as compared with SLE patients.", 
    "83": "The absence of diurnal blood pressure rhythm is characteristic of patients with chronic glomerulonephritis already before they develop hypertension. The prognostic importance and possible target organ-damaging effect of the absence are unknown. Simultaneously, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiographic investigations were done in 12 normotensive and 38 hypertensive IgA nephropathy patients. The hypertensive patients were treated with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) alone or in combination with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. The absence of a night-time blood pressure reduction was frequent in both groups (5/12 vs. 20/38). In the hypertensive patients, blood pressure and left ventricular mass index were higher (124.6 +/- 23. 3/81.2 +/- 15.3 vs. 106.6 +/- 33.4/67.4 +/- 21.8 mm Hg, p < 0.001, and 124.1 +/- 46.2 vs. 89.2 +/- 45.6 g/m(2), p < 0.01). Diastolic left ventricular function was better in normotensive patients, in whom E wave/A wave ratio (E/A) and decelaration time values correlated closely with the diastolic diurnal index (E/A, r = 0.86, p < 0.01; DT, r = -0.70, p < 0.01). In the hypertensive patients, both the left ventricular wall thickness and diastolic function were significantly related to nighttime blood pressure and diurnal index values, but there was no relationship with daytime blood pressure. In conclusion, in IgA nephropathy patients there are mild cardiac abnormalities before they develop hypertension, the abnormalities bearing the closest correlation with the decrease in diurnal blood pressure rhythm. These data suggest the inefficacy of ACEI and calcium channel blockers in treating nighttime hypertension and in reestablishing diurnal rhythm. These phenomena are of great importance in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic malfunction.", 
    "84": "The aim of the study was to identify the most appropriate dosage combination of ramipril and felodipine ER (an extended release tablet) for mild-to-moderate hypertension. Hypertensive patients (N = 507) with supinediastolic blood pressure (DBP) values between 100-115 mm Hg were included in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind study of 3x4 factorial design with a 2-4 week single-blind, placebo run-in and 6 week active treatment phase. The patients were randomized to 12 groups: placebo, ramipril (2.5, 5, 10 mg), felodipine ER (5, 10 mg), or ramipril-felodipine ER combinations (2.5/5 mg, 2.5/10 mg, 5/5 mg, 5/10 mg, 10/5 mg, 10/10 mg). Although the greatest reductions in blood pressure were observed with ramipril-felodipine ER (10/10 mg), consideration of the antihypertensive efficacy and safety factors suggest that the ramipril-felodipine ER (5/5 mg) combination has the best efficacy/tolerability ratio of the combinations tested. The incidence of adverse events with ramipril-felodipine ER combination therapy was similar to that with felodipine ER monotherapy, but peripheral edema, tachycardia and vasodilatation occurred less frequently with ramipril-felodipine ER (5/5 mg) combination than with felodipine ER monotherapy. The combination of ramipril-felodipine ER (5/5 mg) can be considered to be the most suitable option for hypertensive patients with an inadequate response to either of the monocomponents.", 
    "85": "Lifetime treatment with captopril prevents the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). This study tests the hypothesis that compared to untreated hypertensive SHR, captopril-treated SHR display similar diuretic and natriuretic responses to an isotonic saline infusion despite significantly lower arterial pressure. Eight-week-old, male SHR were instrumented with femoral arterial, venous, and bladder catheters. Forty-eight hours later, each rat was infused intravenously with an isotonic saline load (5% of body weight; 0.5 ml/min). Lifetime captopril-treated SHR and untreated control SHR displayed nearly identical natriuretic and diuretic responses to the saline infusion. Thus, although lifetime captopril treatment significantly reduces mean arterial pressure in SHR, renal excretory responses appear to be unaltered. Moreover, histological examination of the kidneys of the lifetime captopril-treated SHR did not reveal significant structural damage in the kidneys at either 8 weeks of age or at 12 months of age. Together, the data suggest that lifetime captopril treatment does not adversely affect renal function and structure in SHR.", 
    "86": "A sensitive and specific assay of imidapril and its active metabolite, imidaprilat, in human plasma has been developed. This method is based on rapid isolation and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). Imidapril and imidaprilat were isolated from human plasma using OASIS HLB (solid-phase extraction cartridge), after deproteinization. The eluent from the cartridge was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was reconstituted in mobile phase and injected into the HPLC-ESI-MS-MS system. Each compound was separated on a semi-micro ODS column in acetonitrile-0.05% (v/v) formic acid (1:3, v/v). The selected ion monitoring using precursor-->product ion combinations of m/z 406-->234 and 378-->206, was used for determination of imidapril and imidaprilat, respectively. The linearity was confirmed in the concentration range of 0.2 to 50 ng/ml in human plasma, and the precision of this assay, expressed as a relative standard deviation, was less than 13.2% over the entire concentration range with adequate assay accuracy. The HPLC-ESI-MS-MS method correlates well with the radioimmunoassay method, therefore, it is useful for the determination of imidapril and imidaprilat with sufficient sensitivity and specificity in clinical studies.", 
    "87": "The interaction between angiotensin [Ang-(1-7)] and bradykinin (BK) was determined in the mesentery of anesthetized Wistar rats using intravital microscopy. Topical application of BK and Ang-(1-7) induced vasodilation that was abolished by the BK B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 and the Ang-(1-7) antagonist A-779, respectively. BK (1 pmol)-induced vasodilation, but not SNP and ACh responses, was potentiated by Ang-(1-7) 10 pmol and 100 pmols. The effect of 100 pmol of Ang-(1-7) on BK-induced vasodilation was abolished by A-779, indomethacin, and L-nitroarginine methyl esther, whereas losartan was without effect. Enalaprilat treatment enhanced the BK- and Ang-(1-7)-induced vasodilation and the potentiating effect of Ang-(1-7) on BK vasodilation. The potentiation of BK-induced vasodilation by Ang-(1-7) is a receptor-mediated phenomenon dependent on cyclooxygenase-related products and NO release.", 
    "88": "In summary, diabetic nephropathy is characterized by a multifactorial disease process. The present survey points to several factors that are treatable by available drugs. We must now consider prophylactic treatment of patients with poor metabolic control not only to lower blood glucose levels, but also to protect against the harmful effects of glucose. ACE inhibitors and several other available drugs have such effects.", 
    "89": "This paper reviews systematic toxicological analysis (STA) procedures for acidic drugs and/or metabolites relevant to clinical and forensic toxicology or doping control using gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Papers from 1992 to 1998 have been taken into consideration. Screening procedures in biosamples (whole blood, plasma, serum, urine, vitreous humor, brain, liver or hair) of humans or animals (horse, or rat) are included for the following drug classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AT-II) blockers, anticoagulants of the 4-hydroxy coumarin type, barbiturates, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (calcium antagonists), diuretics, hypoglycemic sulfonylureas and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Methods for confirmation of preliminary results obtained by screening procedures using immunoassay or chromatographic techniques are also included. Furthermore, procedures for the simultaneous detection of several drug classes are reviewed. The toxicological question to be answered and the consequences for the choice of an adequate method, the sample preparation and the chromatography itself are discussed. The basic information about the biosample assayed, work-up, separation column, mobile phase or separation buffer, detection mode and validation data of each procedure is summarized in 16 tables. They are arranged according to the drug class and the analytical method. Examples of typical applications are presented. Finally, STA procedures are reviewed and described allowing simultaneous screening for different (acidic) drug classes.", 
    "90": "We used a flexibly mounted microdialysis technique to the hearts of rats and examined the protective effect of imidaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the production of hydroxyl free radical (*OH) generation. A microdialysis probe was implanted into the left ventricular myocardium, and dialysate norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured as an index of myocardial interstitial NE levels. Sodium salicylate in Ringer's solution (0.5 nmol/microl/min) was directly infused through a microdialysis probe to detect the generation of *OH reflected by the formation of dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) in rat myocardium. When tyramine (1 mM) was directly infused through the microdialysis probe, the level of NE significantly increased in the dialysate and the level of NE increased by 128 +/- 43%. Imidaprilat (5, 25 and 50 microM) decreased the level of tyramine (1 mM)-induced NE in a concentration-dependent manner. Tyramine clearly produced an increase in *OH formation. In the presence of imidaprilat (50 microM), tyramine failed to increase both 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxylation. Therefore, the effects of imidaprilat on the *OH generation in the sympathetic nerve blockaded hearts by reserpine treatment were not observed. Moreover, to examine the effect of imidaprilat on *OH formation by ischemia/reperfusion of the myocardium, the heart was subjected to myocardial ischemia for 15 min by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. When the heart was reperfused, elevation of NE and 2,3- and 2,5-DHBA in imidaprilat (50 microM)-pretreated animals was not observed in the heart dialysate. Imidaprilat 2.5 mg/kg i.p. pretreatment at 5 h before coronary occlusion significantly blunted the rise of serum creatine phosphokinase and improved the electrocardiogram 2 h after coronary occlusion. These results suggest that imidaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, is associated with cardioprotective effect due to the suppression of NE-induced *OH generation.", 
    "91": "Acute experiments were conducted on narcotized hypertensive rats (vasorenal hypertension) to study the effect of captopril (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) on arterial pressure and cerebral blood flow and its autoregulation before and after transitory (10-12 min) ischemia of the brain (bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries). Captopril normalized the arterial pressure, but changes in the cerebral blood flow proved to be insufficiently stable, particularly in the postischemic period. Normalization of autoregulation of the cerebral blood flow was noted. In captopril treatment the survival rate among rats with ischemia of the brain increased.", 
    "92": "A 72-year-old woman had been treated for hypertension and hyperthyroidism by a local doctor. In May 1998, she came to this institution with a chief complaint of leg edema. Based on the clinical findings, she was diagnosed as having nephrotic syndrome with massive proteinurea, hypoproteinemia and hyperlipidemia. Renal biopsy findings showed minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). No substantial improvement was obtained by steroid therapy. We therefore additionally administered angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate). The urinary protein concentration significantly decreased. On decreasing the dose of steroids, the urinary protein concentration increased. Cyclophosphamide helped us to decrease the steroid dosage. This treatment resulted in type II incomplete remission. The final diagnosis was refractory MCNS. During steroid therapy, she developed hyperglycemia. She had no histology of diabetes mellitus. There is therefore a possibility that steroids can induce hyperglycemia even in patients without a history of diabetes mellitus. These results suggest that careful monitoring of plasma glucose is necessary during steroid therapy and that the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is effective in elderly patients with refractory primary nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "93": "To clarify age-related differences in the characteristics of IgA nephropathy, we investigated 117 patients of all ages. The number of patients in the second decade of age was larger than that in the other age decades. There was no difference in sex in all age brackets. About one half of the patients under ten years of age presented as acute nephritis, but their prognosis was favorable. Patients over 10 years, most of whom were detected by chance, tended to have a greater degree of proteinuria, a lesser degree of creatinine clearance, a higher frequency of hypertension, and a higher level of serum cholesterol with age. Although the intensity of mesangial cell proliferation was not changed, the grade of glomerulosclerosis, interstitial change, and arteriosclerosis increased and the prognosis became poor as age advanced. Treatment with corticosteroids and antiplatelet agents was less effective in adults, especially in the older age brackets than in children because the frequency of histologically chronic lesions increased. In these cases, lipid-lowering agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be helpful in preventing the progression.", 
    "94": "Although the glomerulus, particularly the mesangium, has been the focus of intense investigation in diabetes, tubulointerstitial injury is also a major feature of diabetic nephropathy and an important predictor of renal dysfunction. The renal tubule in diabetes is subject to both direct and indirect pathogenetic influences as a consequence of its position in the nephron and its resorptive function. On exposure to glucose, proximal tubular cells elaborate vasoactive hormones, including angiotensin II and injurious cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), as well as extracellular matrix proteins. In turn, angiotensin II may further increase TGF-beta expression in both proximal tubular and interstitial cells, thus amplifying the stimulus to fibrogenesis in the renal tubulointerstitium. In addition to these mostly direct influences, the renal tubule, particularly its proximal segment, is exposed to glomerular effluent. In the diabetic state, this includes large quantities of advanced glycation end products and glucose and, at later stages in the evolution of diabetic nephropathy, protein, all of which are factors that may induce TGF-beta expression and fibrosis. Diabetic nephropathy should therefore be viewed as a disease affecting the entire nephron. Continued exploration into tubulointerstitial disease in addition to glomerular injury in diabetes may help provide further insights into the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and additional targets for therapeutic intervention.", 
    "95": "The study was designed to evaluate the management of acute myocardial infarction in the general medical wards of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. All patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted from September 1996 to August 1997, were evaluated with regard to the time delay in admission and drug treatment. The facilities for monitoring and resuscitation were also assessed. A total of 259 patients were included in the study, 173 males and 86 females. The median time delay from the onset of the pain to admission at the out-patients department was 12 hours and that between out-patients department admission and ward admission was 20 minutes. The median delay in obtaining a 12-lead electrocardiogram when the patient was in the ward was 90 minutes. Review of the data showed that thrombolytic therapy, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are underused. Complications were common. All the medical wards had adequate monitoring and resuscitation facilities. With adequate training of doctors and the availability of specialised cardiac nurses, thrombolytic therapy can be used effectively in medical wards.", 
    "96": "The effects of intracerebroventricular injections of the long-lasting somatostatin analog octreotide (Oct) were studied on sleep and behavior in rats. Pyrogen-free physiological saline and Oct (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 microgram) or vehicle were administered at light onset, and the electroencephalogram (EEG), motor activity, and cortical brain temperature were recorded during the 12-h light period. Plasma growth hormone (GH) concentrations were measured in samples taken at 30-min intervals after Oct. Oct (0.01 and 0.1 microgram) suppressed non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) for 1-2 h. NREMS intensity (delta EEG activity during NREMS) dose dependently increased in hour 3 postinjection and thereafter (0.1 microgram). Plasma GH concentrations were suppressed after Oct (0.01 and 0.1 microgram), but pulses of GH secretions occurred 90-120 min postinjection in each rat. Oct (0.1 microgram) enhanced behavioral activity, including prompt drinking followed by grooming, scratching, and feeding. Intracerebroventricular injection of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (30 microgram, 10 min before Oct), blocked these behavioral responses but not the Oct-induced sleep alterations. The changes in sleep after intracerebroventricular Oct suggest an intracerebral action site and might result from Oct-induced variations in the sleep-promoting activity of GH-releasing hormone.", 
    "97": "Captopril renography (CR) has been shown to be a useful technique in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension (RVH). This disease is a significant complication of the kidney transplanted patient so that early diagnosis would be extremely useful to preserve renal function and prevent graft loss. This work evaluates the role of CR, together with arteriography and doppler-ultrasound, in the diagnosis of RVH.", 
    "98": "A total of 19 transplanted patients with clinical suspicion of RVH underwent an isotopic study, a doppler-ultrasound study and an arteriography. Scintigraphy was performed 1 hour after a 50 mg dose of captopril, with oral hydration and i.v. administration of approximately 111 MBq of 99mTc-MAG3 and 20 mg of furosemide. If abnormal, a subsequent renography in baseline conditions was performed for comparison.", 
    "99": "Overall, 11 patients had renovascular hypertension. Sensitivity and specificity of CR were 91% and 80% respectively, 100% and 60% for US and 91% and 100% for arteriography. The CR yielded one false positive result and 2 false negatives cases: one with 50% stenosis and one polar artery stenosis. Six patients were successfully dilated or operated.",

    "101": "We performed a retrospective cohort study to assess the relation between administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and duration of pleural drainage in the early postoperative period in patients who underwent a modified Fontan operation at our institution from 1990 through 1996. This study failed to show that administration of captopril decreased the duration of pleural drainage in patients after a modified Fontan operation.", 
    "102": "Oxygen consumption at peak exercise (peak VO2) is a strong independent predictor of the outcome in congestive heart failure (CHF). Renin-angiotensin system inhibition with either ACE or AT1 receptor blockers is effective on peak VO2. We evaluated whether mechanisms are similar for the 2 categories of drugs and whether their combination is able to produce a synergistic effect. Twenty CHF patients were randomized to receive, in a double-blind fashion, placebo + placebo (P+P), enalapril (20 mg/day) + placebo (E+P), losartan (50 mg/day) + placebo (L+P), and enalapril + losartan (E+L) or the same preparations in a reverse order, each for 8 weeks. Two patients did not complete the trial. Pulmonary function, cardiopulmonary exercise test, plasma neurohormones, and quality of life were assessed at the end of each treatment. Compared with P+P, E+P, and L+P similarly (16% and 15%, respectively) and significantly (p <0.01) augmented peak VO2. Enalapril improved lung function (reduced slope of ventilation vs carbon dioxide production and dead space to tidal volume ratio, and increased alveolar membrane conductance and tidal volume). Losartan likely activated the exercising muscle perfusion (raised delta VO2/delta work rate, which is a measure of aerobic work efficiency). In combination, they further increased peak VO2, 10% from E+P (p <0.05) and 11% from L+P (p <0.05). Compared with run-in, E+P and L+P significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine by 70 +/- 14 pg/ml and 100 +/- 16 pg/ml and aldosterone by 1.6 +/- 0.7 ng/dl and 1.6 +/- 0.8 ng/dl. These changes were significantly greater when the drugs were combined (140 +/- 20 pg/ml for norepinephrine, and 5.6 +/- 0.9 ng/dl for aldosterone). Quality-of-life score did not improve significantly at each treatment step. Thus, lorsartan and enalapril similarly increased peak VO2 in CHF patients, but mediators of this effect were, at least in part, different therapeutic targets that may be synergistic when the 2 drugs are combined.", 
    "103": "This study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 24 hours of admission in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to identify clinical factors associated with ACE inhibitor-prescribing patterns. Demographic, procedural, and acute medication use from 202,438 patients with AMI were collected at 1,470 US hospitals participating in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2 from June 1994 through June 1996. Acute ACE inhibitor use increased from 14.0% in 1994 to 17.3% in 1996. After controlling for all important clinical variables, we found that there was a significant increase in the odds of acute ACE inhibitor treatment over time (odds ratio [OR]1.07 for each 180-day period; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.06 to 1.08; p<0.0001). Univariate data suggested that patients treated acutely with ACE inhibitors tended to be older (70.9 vs. 67.2 years) and had lower rates of in-hospital mortality (8.8% vs. 11.0%). Independent predictors of receiving an ACE inhibitor acutely included anterior wall infarction (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.32 to 1.40), Killip class 2 or 3 (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.72 to 1.83), prior myocardial infarction (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.37), prior history of congestive heart failure (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.82 to 1.95), and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.38). Physicians are prescribing ACE inhibitors acutely in patients with AMI with increasing frequency. Patients with evidence of congestive heart failure and those with anterior myocardial infarction have the greatest expected benefit from such therapy, and these persons receive such treatment most often. However, most patients hospitalized with AMI do not receive this potentially life-saving therapy.", 
    "104": "Abnormal autonomic nervous system impairment in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has a circadian pattern with the greatest manifestation in the morning hours; it probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias and acute ischemic syndromes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve autonomic function in patients with AMI, but the circadian pattern of this effect has not been studied. Heart rate variability-normalized frequency domain indexes were assessed 5 days (baseline) after the onset of uncomplicated AMI and 30 days after therapy with quinapril (n = 30), metoprolol (n = 30), or placebo (n = 30) with a solid-state digital Holter monitor. Normal subjects (n = 30) were used as controls. Quinapril increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic modulation, and improved sympathovagal interactions manifested by an increase in normalized high-frequency power (HFP), and a decrease in normalized low-frequency power (LFP), and their ratio (LFP/HFP) during the entire 24-hour period (p<0.001), with maximal effect on the ratio (p<0.0001) between 02.00 to 04.00 A.M., 08.00 to 11.00 A.M., and 19.00 to 22.00 P.M. (delta% ratio -30%, -32%, and -26%, respectively). Metoprolol increased HFP and decreased LFP and the LFP/HFP ratio mainly between 08.00 A.M. to 12.00 noon, and 19.00 to 22.00 P.M. (delta% ratio -21%, and -12% respectively, p<0.001). Heart rate variability indexes in the placebo group and controls remained unchanged 30 days after the baseline study. In conclusion, quinapril increased parasympathetic, and decreased sympathetic and partially restored sympathovagal interaction in patients with uncomplicated AMI during the entire 24-hour period, with peak effect in the early and late morning and evening hours. Metoprolol had a similar effect during the late morning and evening hours, but at a lower level. These effects may prove beneficial in reducing cardiac arrhythmias and acute ischemic syndromes in past-AMI patients.", 
    "105": "The high mortality rate and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure has prompted numerous clinical trials aimed at reducing mortality by addressing arrhythmic death. Recently completed trials have suggested that for patients who have survived cardiac arrest, the preferred treatment may be an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). From the standpoint of primary prevention, implantable defibrillators and amiodarone have received the most attention. It remains unclear, however, to which patients these studies apply, and if and how the results might be generalized. No available studies confirm an additional benefit of pharmacologic or device-based antiarrhythmic therapy beyond that offered by optimal treatment with beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering drugs in the majority of patients with cardiomyopathy. Clinical trials are ongoing to address these issues.", 
    "106": "We examined the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1a) on the action of protooncogene c-fos in salt-sensitive hypertensive rats. Seven-week old Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high (8%)-salt diet were treated with ACEI, cilazapril (10 mg/kg) or AT1a, TCV-116 (1mg/ kg) every day for 6 weeks. The control animals were fed a low (0. 3%)-salt diet. Systolic blood pressure gradually increased in high-salt-loaded rats and was higher than low-salt-treated rats throughout the study. However, both medications had no significant antihypertensive effect. After 6 weeks of therapy, glomerular mRNA and nuclear protein were extracted from the resected kidneys. Competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed a high level of glomerular c-fos mRNA in high-salt-loaded rats and that ACEI or AT1a treatment did not significantly change its level. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that treatment with AT1a significantly decreased the activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding activity in the glomerular nuclear extract compared to ACEI. Our findings suggest that, compared with ACEI treatment, long-term treatment with AT1a may contribute to attenuation of the glomerular injury in salt-sensitive hypertension by inhibiting AP-1 transcription activity independent of its antihypertensive effect.", 
    "107": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert their effects by inhibiting angiotensin II (AII) production, but also by inhibiting bradykinin (BK) degradation. In order to clarify whether BK is involved in the systemic effects of ACE inhibition in the newborn period, we investigated the effect of perindoprilat (20 microgram/kg i.v.) in newborn rabbits, with or without the blockade of BK beta(2)-receptors (Hoe 140, 300 microgram/kg s.c.). The bolus infusion of perindoprilat resulted in a marked fall in mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and a slight decrease in heart rate. BK receptor blockade had no effect on the perindoprilat-induced hypotension but the negative chronotropic effect of ACE inhibition was partly prevented by pretreatment with Hoe 140. We therefore conclude that BK is not involved in neonatal blood pressure regulation but that the ACE inhibition-induced neonatal bradycardia is at least partly BK- mediated.", 
    "108": "A series of N-acetylproline esters (alkyl side chain length, 5-18) were synthesized and tested for potential skin penetration enhancement activity using modified Franz diffusion cells and hairless mouse skin as the penetration barrier. Benazepril and hydrocortisone were used as model drugs and were applied as saturated solutions in propylene glycol. The enhancers were added at a concentration of 5% (w/v). Drug flux, permeability coefficient and enhancement ratios for permeability coefficient were determined. Azone was used as the positive control. While all the compounds tested increased the skin penetration of hydrocortisone, the 5- and 8- carbon esters had no significant effect on the skin penetration of benazepril. The highest fluxes were obtained with 11, 12, and 18-carbon esters and they were comparable to Azone. There was no significant difference between the fluxes obtained with 2 and 5% (w/v) concentrations of the 12-carbon ester on hydrocortisone permeation. The 16-carbon ester, where ethanol was used as a cosolvent, significantly increased the fluxes of both the drugs compared to the control. Differential scanning calorimetric studies suggested that the enhancers may be acting on the lipids of the stratum corneum and their effect was similar to that of Azone. The membrane/vehicle partition coefficient studies indicated an increase in benazepril partition coefficient with enhancer treatment compared to the control. Maximum flux increase was obtained with the 11 and 12 carbon (alkyl chain length) esters for both benazepril and hydrocortisone. The 18- carbon ester which has a cis-double bond in the alkyl side chain, also increased the flux significantly.", 
    "109": "Hemodynamic responses to angiotensin II and the role of AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and the autonomic nervous system in mediating acute responses to angiotensin II were investigated in anesthetized CD1 mice. Injections of angiotensin II caused dose-related increases in systemic arterial pressure that were antagonized by candesartan. Pressor responses to angiotensin II were not altered by PD-123,319 in doses up to 25 mg/kg iv. At the lowest dose studied (20 microgram/kg iv), the inhibitory effects of candesartan were competitive, whereas at the highest dose (100 microgram/kg iv) the dose-response curve for angiotensin II was shifted to the right in a nonparallel manner with inhibitory effects that could not be surmounted. The inhibitory effects of candesartan were selective and were similar in animals pretreated with enalaprilat (1 mg/kg iv) to reduce endogenous angiotensin II production. Acute pressor responses to angiotensin II were not altered by propranolol (200 microgram/kg iv), phentolamine (200 microgram/kg iv), or atropine (1 mg/kg iv) but were enhanced by hexamethonium (5 mg/kg iv). Increases in total peripheral resistance induced by angiotensin II were inhibited by the AT(1)-receptor antagonist but were not altered by AT(2)-, alpha-, or beta-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that acute pressor responses to angiotensin II are mediated by AT(1) receptors, are buffered by the baroreceptors, and are not modulated by effects on AT(2) receptors and that activation of the sympathetic nervous system plays little if any role in mediating rapid hemodynamic responses to the peptide in anesthetized CD1 mice.", 
    "110": "As men age, the incidence of both benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension increases. Concomitant occurrence of these conditions also increases with age, and the 2 are frequently encountered together in primary care practice. In addition, many patients with hypertension require >1 antihypertensive agent to adequately control blood pressure. In a multicenter, community-based, 8-week, uncontrolled, open-label study, we evaluated doxazosin, a selective alpha1-adrenergic-receptor antagonist, in 491 patients with concomitant symptomatic BPH (American Urological Association [AUA] symptom score > or =12) and hypertension, some previously untreated and some with inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure 120-179 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 80-109 mm Hg) despite taking 1 or 2 antihypertensive agents. Patients were allocated to 1 of 4 groups at baseline according to their diastolic blood pressure (control was considered DBP <90 mm Hg) and whether they had received antihypertensive medication before the study. Thus the 4 groups were treated/well-controlled, treated/poorly controlled, untreated/hypertensive, and untreated/normotensive. In all patient groups, doxazosin therapy significantly improved AUA total symptom and bothersomeness scores and BPH-specific indices of health status and interference with activities (P<0.001). Significant improvements in BPH symptoms were observed with doxazosin, regardless of whether initial symptoms were moderate or severe (P<0.001). Clinically important blood pressure lowering occurred only in the patient groups in which blood pressure had been elevated at baseline. Patients whose blood pressure was poorly controlled at baseline, either without or with treatment (predominantly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers), achieved adequate blood pressure control (reduction to <140/90 mm Hg) with the addition of doxazosin. Similar improvements in blood pressure and BPH symptoms were seen in both older (> or =65 years) and younger (45 to 64 years) patients, and doxazosin was well tolerated by both groups. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was dizziness (13.0% of patients); however, patients classified the dizziness as mild in approximately 75% of reports, and severe dizziness was reported by only 2 patients (0.4%). Doxazosin is an effective antihypertensive agent when used in combination with agents from other antihypertensive classes in patients with poorly controlled hypertension and BPH, and is also successful as monotherapy for controlling both BPH and hypertension in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "111": "Since angiotensin II is an established target of pharmacological interventions, there is an increasing interest in the biological effects and metabolism of other vasoactive peptides like atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and endothelin (ET). Exogenous administration of the vasodilatory and natriuretic ANF and of its analogues improved haemodynamics and renal function in cardiovascular disease, including congestive heart failure (CHF). Effects of natriuretic peptides appeared to be attenuated during prolonged infusion and in more severe disease. Promising results were obtained in animal experiments and initial patient studies concerning haemodynamics and kidney function with inhibition of ANF metabolism by inhibitors of the neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP). With further clinical studies, moderately relevant effects of acute intravenous or oral NEP inhibition were observed, but these effects were blunted with prolonged drug administration. There is increasing evidence that NEP inhibitors such as candoxatril, expected to exhibit vasodilatory activity at least at certain doses and in certain clinical settings, even induce vasoconstriction. As well as natriuretic peptides, NEP also metabolises the vasoactive peptides ET, angiotensin II and bradykinin. It now appears to be evident, especially from human experiments on forearm blood flow after intra-arterial infusion of agents, that NEP inhibitor--induced vasoconstriction is mediated by increased ET-1 rather than by angiotensin II. The hypothesis that concurrent ACE inhibition would unmask the benefits of NEP inhibitors was not supported by a recent 10-week study in CHF; with ecadotril given to ACE inhibitor-pretreated patients, there were no clear hints towards improvement of symptoms but troublesome aspects on mortality. Future clinical studies on dual inhibitors of NEP and ACE will have to reveal the place of NEP inhibition in cardiovascular disease in the presence of established therapeutic standards. Remarkable haemodynamic and cardioprotective effects have been obtained with antagonists of the ET receptor. Specific inhibitors of the endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) have only recently been introduced, inhibiting ET generation from its precursor, big ET. If the results previously obtained with ET receptor antagonists can be reproduced with ECE inhibitors, and transferred to clinical medicine, endopeptidase inhibition might open new horizons in cardiovascular treatment strategies.", 
    "112": "The hemoregulatory peptide Acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) has been reported to accumulate in plasma and urine after the oral administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in humans. It is unknown whether such an accumulation also occurs in tissues. We administered captopril (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) orally for 2 weeks to Wistar rats. In a second experiment, captopril (10 mg/kg) was administered for 9 days and was followed by a 1-h i.v. infusion of either AcSDKP (0.1 or 2 mg/kg) or saline on day 9. Captopril alone dose-dependently increased plasma AcSDKP by a factor of 3 to 5 and urine AcSDKP by a factor of 3. It slightly increased renal and pulmonary AcSDKP concentrations but did not affect AcSDKP concentrations in bone marrow and spleen. The combination of AcSDKP (2 mg/kg) and captopril gave very high AcSDKP concentrations in plasma and urine and increases in AcSDKP concentration by factors of 27 in kidney, 5.5 in lung, and 6.9 in the extracellular fraction of bone marrow. In contrast, no change was observed in the AcSDKP concentration in spleen and in the intracellular fraction of bone marrow. In conclusion, during chronic ACE inhibition in rats, AcSDKP levels slightly increased in organs with high ACE contents. No such increase occurred in hematopoietic organs. AcSDKP had to be combined with captopril to significantly increase its concentration in tissues other than the spleen. The possibility of pharmacologically increasing AcSDKP levels in the extracellular fraction of bone marrow may be of value for protecting hematopoietic cells from the toxicity of cancer chemotherapy.", 
    "113": "Hypotension caused by hypovolemic, hemorrhagic shock induces disturbances in the immune system that may contribute to an increased susceptibility to sepsis. The effect of chemically induced hypotension on circulating cytokines and adhesion molecules has not been investigated yet. In 21 patients scheduled for resection of malignant choroidal melanoma of the eye the perioperative serum levels of the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and the adhesion molecules sE-Selectin and sICAM-1 were investigated. Moderate hypothermia of 32 degrees C was induced in all patients. In 14 patients profound hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure 35-40 mmHg, hypotension group) was induced by enalapril and nitroglycerin for a mean duration of 71 min. In 7 patients the tumor was not resectable, and hypotension was not induced (controls). We did not detect significant differences in serum levels of cytokines or sE-Selectin perioperatively in patients with profound hypotension compared with controls. In both groups IL-6 serum levels increased significantly and reached a maximum after rewarming (17 +/- 6 and 16 +/- 5 pg/dL, respectively, P < 0.001). IL-1beta, IL-10, and TNF-alpha did not change perioperatively in both groups. On the first postoperative day sICAM-1 serum levels were significantly increased in both groups (mean increase of 96 and 54 ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). We conclude from this study that profound normovolemic arterial hypotension does not seem to have effects on serum levels of circulating IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and sE-Selectin. Perioperative moderate hypothermia may be the reason for the postoperative increase in sICAM-1 levels independent of the blood pressure.", 
    "114": "Long-term administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) induces development of hypertension and hypertrophy of the left ventricle in rats. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the effect of chronic L-NAME treatment on DNA and RNA concentration, and protein synthesis in the rat heart, aorta, brain and kidney and to determine the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril on these potential alterations. Four groups of rats were investigated: control, L-NAME (40 mg kg-1 day-1), captopril (100 mg kg-1 day-1), and L-NAME (40 mg kg-1 day-1) + captopril (100 mg kg-1 day-1). NO synthase activity in the heart, aorta, brain and kidney was found to be decreased in the L-NAME group. In the group of rats treated with L-NAME + captopril, captopril did not affect NO synthase inhibition. Captopril, however, completely prevented development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in this group. In the L-NAME group, DNA and RNA concentrations, as well as [14C]leucine incorporation, were significantly increased in all the tissues investigated. In the L-NAME + captopril group, captopril completely prevented the enhancement of DNA and RNA concentrations and [14C]leucine incorporation in all tissues compared to the L-NAME group. Moreover, a significant decrease in RNA concentration and [14C]leucine incorporation below control values was found in the captopril group as well as the L-NAME + captopril group in all the tissues investigated. We conclude that captopril prevented the development of hypertension and increase in nucleic acid concentration and protein synthesis in the heart, aorta, brain and kidney in rats treated with L-NAME + captopril. However, this protective effect of captopril was not associated with increased NO synthase activity in this model of hypertension.", 
    "115": "The aim of the present research was to study the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ANG II in amphibian (Rana esculenta) testicular steroidogenesis and prostaglandin production. Hormonal effects of ACE, ACE inhibitors, synthetic bullfrog ANG I, and [Val(5)]ANG II were determined in frog testis of prereproductive period. Production of 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, androgens, and PGE(2) and PGF(2alpha) was determined by incubating frog testes with ACE (2.5 mU/ml), captopril (0.1 mM), lisinopril (0.1 mM), [Val(5)]ANG II (1 microM), and synthetic bullfrog ANG I (1 microM). The analysis of the data showed an independent modulation of 17beta-estradiol and androgen production by ACE and ANG II. The ACE pathway caused a decrease of 17beta-estradiol production and an increase of androgen production in frog testes; on the other hand, the ANG II pathway increased 17beta-estradiol production and decreased androgen production. The determination of testicular aromatase activity showed a positive regulation by ANG II and a negative regulation by ACE. As for prostaglandin production, only ANG II influenced PGF(2alpha). These results suggest a new physiological role of ACE and ANG II in modulating steroidogenesis and prostaglandin production.", 
    "116": "Chronic mitral regurgitation (MR) in dogs results in pulmonary congestion and increased cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and angiotensin (ANG) II levels. ACE could contribute to altered pulmonary vasomotion in heart failure, and ACE inhibitor (ACEI) therapy may normalize pulmonary vasomotion. We evaluated pulmonary artery (PA) responses to ANG II and bradykinin (BK) in control dogs, in dogs with 4 mo of MR, in MR dogs treated with the ACEI ramipril (MR + R), and in control dogs treated with ramipril (C + R). Mean PA systolic pressure increased in MR dogs (21 +/- 4 mmHg) but was normal in MR + R dogs (13 +/- 1 mmHg). Constriction of PA rings to ANG II was depressed in MR dogs. ACEI treatment (MR + R) restored ANG II responsiveness, but peak ANG II response (3.6 +/- 0.2 g) in MR + R dogs remained lower than in C + R dogs (4.7 +/- 0.2 g). Endothelium-dependent relaxation to BK was decreased (-87 +/- 4% C, -65 +/- 4% MR; P < 0.05). Ramipril (MR + R) restored relaxation to BK. This demonstrates that pulmonary congestion results in impaired pulmonary vasomotion to ANG II and BK, which ACEIs could normalize, supporting the use of ACEIs in clinical management of chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "117": "Protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation appear important in conferring hypertrophy in vitro. However, the response of PKC and MAP kinase to stimuli known to induce hypertrophy in vivo has not been determined. We recently demonstrated that pressure-overload hypertrophy induced a transiently transfected gene driven by an hypertrophy responsive enhancer (HRE) through a marked increase in binding activity of its interacting nuclear factor (HRF). These data suggested that the HRE/HRF could serve as a target for evaluating the signal transduction events responsible for hypertrophy in vivo. Accordingly, we characterized MAP kinase and PKC isoform activation, injected HRE driven reporter gene expression, and HRF binding activity in rat hearts subjected to ascending aortic clipping or sham operation in the presence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril, hydralazine, or no treatment. Analyses showed that PKC-epsilon and MAP kinase were acutely activated following ascending aortic ligature and that fosinopril significantly inhibited but did not completely abrogate PKC-epsilon and MAP kinase activation. However, fosinopril completely prevented pressure overload-mediated induction of HRE containing constructs and obviated increased HRF binding activity. These results suggest a direct relationship between ACE activity and HRE/HRF-mediated gene activation and imply that PKC-epsilon and MAP kinase may be involved in transducing this signal.", 
    "118": "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the pathophysiology of indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration (IIGU), including changes in gastric mucosal blood flow, motility, and acidity. It seems probable that adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-dependent potassium channels (K(ATP)) have a regulatory effect on the above factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of K(ATP) channel modulators, diazoxide as a channel opener and glibenclamide as a K(ATP) antagonist, on IIGU.", 
    "119": "Male rats were starved for 24 h. Groups of 10 animals were used. Diazoxide at doses of 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg and glibenclamide at doses of 2, 6, and 18 mg/kg were injected intraperitoneally 30 min before the subcutaneous injection of 30 mg/kg of indomethacin. To assess the effects of indomethacin on the gastric mucosal vascular bed, different doses of enalapril and hydralazine, two vasodilators with mechanisms of action independent of K(ATP), were also studied. Gastric mucosal ulceration was noted, and fasting blood sugar was assayed. The data were compared between the groups.", 
    "120": "Indomethacin produced gastric ulceration in 100% of rats with a severity rating of 2.15/10. This was prevented by diazoxide and aggravated by glibenclamide. Diazoxide increased and glibenclamide decreased fasting blood sugar. Neither enalapril nor hydralazine showed any effect on IIGU and/or fasting blood sugar.", 
    "121": "K(ATP) modulators may play an important role in the pathophysiology of IIGU through a peripheral action on mucosal and submucosal blood flow of the stomach, gastric motility, acidity, or an action on the vagus complex center of the brain.", 
    "122": "Cardiac transplantation is the only therapy that is able to substantially modify the natural evolution of patients with severe heart failure, along with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Nevertheless, because of the limited number of donors, its impact is scarce compared to the magnitude of the problem. Up to the end of 1998, 48,541 orthotopic cardiac transplantations and about 2,510 heart and both lung transplantations have been registered throughout the world. In Spain 2,780 procedures have been performed in the last 15 years. The survival expectations for a transplanted patient is 75% after the first year and 60% the following 5 years. The average duration of the graft is 8 years and 6 months. Cardiac transplantation is indicated for young and middle-age patients with irreversible cardiac process in bad clinical condition, with no other possibility of medical or surgical management and with a limited life expectancy. The major debate when choosing this therapy appears with the critical patients, patients older than 65 years, and some patients with systemic diseases. The great demand of transplantation obliges the teams to enlarge the criteria for donors' acceptance. At the same time, the increase of the knowledge about the transmission of some infections, mainly viral, forces to review those criteria day-to-day. The use of different immunosuppressive strategies pursues the control of rejection. The most commonly used is the so-called triple therapy (cyclosporine-azathioprine and steroids). The use of antilymphocytic antibodies such as cytolytic induction treatment is not unanimously accepted. Some of the new immunosuppressive agents such as myphenolate-mofetil and tacrolimus seem to offer advantages mainly due to their greater potency. Since transplantation is a limited procedure, of which its practise has an effect on the whole health system of a country, a perfect planning and adequacy of the Centers is compulsory, as well as the setting-up of clear rules for the use of donors and priority of transplantation. Finally, the patient must be informed clearly and comprehensively at length of the risks, limitations and expectations of these complex procedures.", 
    "123": "ACE inhibitors are important therapeutic agents in controlling hypertension, correcting some of its pathophysiological derangement and improving its prognosis. While there are many such agents, there may be some important differences between them. This placebo run-in, double blind, crossover study, using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, compares the efficacy of perindopril 4-8 mg and enalapril 10-20 mg as once daily antihypertensive agents on 32 patients. For diastolic blood pressure (DBP), perindopril had a placebo-corrected peak (P) reduction of blood pressure (BP) of -6.4 +/- 1.3 mmHg vs its placebo-corrected trough (T) of -5.2 +/- 1.7 mmHg. Enalapril had a reduction in DBP of -8.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg (P) and -5.7 +/- 1.7 mmHg (T). For systolic blood pressure (SBP), perindopril had a reduction of -7.5 +/- 1.6 mmHg (P) vs -7.3 +/- 2.2 mmHg (T) compared to enalapril with -10.8 +/- 1.6 mmHg (P) vs -8.3 +/- 2.3 mmHg (T). Placebo-corrected trough-to-peak ratio (SBP/DBP) for perindopril was 0.97/0.81 vs 0.77/0.67 for enalapril. There was no difference noted in 24-hour mean BP, area under the curve or post-dose casual BP measurements. Both perindopril and enalapril were well tolerated and the two treatment groups had similar safety profiles. Perindopril thus had a predictable and sustained blood pressure effect giving a 24-hour cover for the patient without excessive peak effect or poor trough effect.", 
    "124": "Adult Indonesian outpatients were randomised to receive either valsartan 80 mg once daily or captopril 25 mg twice daily for 8 weeks. The main criterion for tolerability was the incidence of adverse events. The primary efficacy variable was the change in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) from baseline to endpoint. No valsartan patients experienced dry cough, which was reported by 22 captopril patients (21.6%). Both drugs reduced mean SDBP and SSBP, with a trend in favour of valsartan. The percentage of valsartan patients whose BP normalised was higher than in captopril patients at week 4 (37% and 22%) and week 8 (45% and 34%), the difference being statistically significant at week 4 (p < 0.05). Valsartan 80 mg once daily is as effective as captopril 25 mg twice daily in reducing blood pressure in Indonesian patients, and has a better tolerability profile in respect of dry cough.", 
    "125": "1. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that long-term administration of the hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin may regress hypertrophy and the possible effect of simvastatin on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in rats with pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy. 2. Pressure-overload left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of rats was induced by part coarctation of the abdominal aorta; a sham-operated group served as the control. Six weeks after operation, animals were divided into three groups and an 8 week treatment period was insitgated as follows: (i) the simvastatin treatment group received simvastatin at 3.6 mg/kg per day, p.o.; (ii) the ACE inhibitor group received captopril at 50 mg/kg per day, p.o.; and (iii) the LVH control group received no drug treatment. 3. At the end of the treatment period, left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were monitored in vivo. Diastolic pressure-volume relationships were evaluated in a Langendorff preparation with a balloon-in-left ventricle (LV) heart. Myocyte cell width was measured. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and angiotensin (Ang)II and hydroxyproline contents of the LV were determined. 4. At the end of the experiments, LVH was established in the LVH control group by increases in LV weight, LV weight/body-weight ratio, LV weight/right ventricle weight ratio, LV myocyte cell width, LVSP and LVEDP by 40, 26, 19, 61, 56 and 59%, respectively (all P < 0.01), compared with the sham-operated group. In the simvastatin-treated and ACE inhibitor groups all these parameters were significantly reduced compared with sham-operated controls. In the LVH control group, ACE activity and AngII and hydroxyproline contents of LV tissue increased by 180, 123 and 70, respectively (all P < 0.01), compared with the sham-operated group. Compared with the LVH group, in the simvastatin-treated and ACE inhibitor groups ACE activity was reduced by 36 (P < 0.05) and 48% (P < 0.01), respectively, AngII content was reduced by 11 (P < 0.05) and 43% (P < 0.01), respectively, and hydroxyproline content was reduced by 23 (P < 0.01) and 10% (P < 0.05), respectively. 5. For the first time, the results of the present study demonstrate that simvastatin significantly reduces LVH, cardiac tissue ACE activity and improves LV performance in pressure-overloaded rats. Because, compared with captopril, simvastatin is more potent in its reduction of LVH and less potent in its inhibition of ACE activity, the mechanism of its antihypertrophic action, in addition to ACE inhibition, may involve inhibition of the mevalonic acid pathway, the main target of action of statins. Thus, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may be beneficial for the clinical treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.",

The heart rate was 130 beats/min and no P waves were present on a surface electrocardiogram. Thoracic radiographs and an echocardiogram demonstrated severe biatrial dilatation, pleural effusion and restrictive pleural disease. Permanent atrial standstill was suspected. Pleurocentesis was performed and therapy was started with enalapril, frusemide and aspirin. Intracardiac electrograms revealed no atrial activity, and atrial pacing failed to elicit atrial or ventricular depolarisations. The patient was euthanased. Necropsy showed severe atrial wall thinning with marked cardiocyte loss. Persistent atrial standstill is a rare disease in the cat. Clinical signs may have been due to loss of atrial function, ventricular diastolic dysfunction, bradycardia, neurohormonal activation and reduced atrial natriuretic peptide plasma concentrations.", 
    "127": "We determined the effect of chronic administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, on the in vivo pulmonary inactivation of bradykinin (BK) and conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I). In addition we assessed whether chronic ACE inhibition influenced the activity of prolylendopeptidase (PEP), which metabolizes Ang I to generate angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-[1-7]) and inactivates BK. Male Wistar rats were treated orally with enalapril (10 mg/kg once a day) for 7 to 15 days (n = 20) and 21 to 30 days (n = 11). Vehicle-treated rats (7 to 30 days, n = 11) were used as controls. Pulmonary inactivation of BK and conversion of Ang I were determined in conscious enalapril- or vehicle-treated rats before and after intravenous administration of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (MK-422, 10 mg/kg). Pulmonary inactivation of BK (%) was determined by comparing equipotent doses of BK injected by the intravenous and intraaortic routes, and Ang I conversion (%) by comparing the pressor effect of Ang I and Ang II injected intravenously. PEP-like activity in plasma and lung homogenates was determined fluorometrically using the synthetic substrate Suc-Gly-Pro-MCA. In control rats, pulmonary BK inactivation averaged 97.6% +/-0.54%. Acute ACE inhibition with MK-422 reduced BK inactivation to 42.0% +/- 2.7%. However, in rats treated chronically with enalapril, BK inactivation was increased as compared with acute ACE inhibition, averaging 58.8% +/- 3.7% at 7 to 15 days and 58.8% +/- 4.5% at 21 to 30 days of treatment. Intravenous administration of MK-422 to the enalapril-treated rats did not return the increased BK inactivation to the level observed during acute ACE inhibition. In contrast, Ang I conversion was significantly reduced from 46.7% +/- 6.5% to 0.9% +/-0.2% by MK-422, and this inhibition remained essentially unchanged during chronic treatment. PEP-like activity in plasma and lung homogenates of control rats was 4.4 +/- 0.3 nmol MCA/min/mL and 11.4 +/- 0.9 nmol MCA/min/mg protein, respectively. After chronic treatment with enalapril there was a progressive increase of PEP-like activity in both plasma and lung, which after 21 to 30 days of treatment averaged 10.7 +/- 1.7 nmol MCA/min/mL and 29.2 +/- 2.8 nmol MCA/min/mg protein, respectively. These data indicate that chronic ACE blockade induces alternative BK-inactivating mechanisms and increases Ang-(1-7)-generating mechanisms.", 
    "128": "The renoprotective effect of captopril on progression of diabetic nephropathy was demonstrated by the Collaborative Study Group Captopril Trial and might be independent of blood pressure. Because angiotensin II is known to stimulate the prosclerotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), we postulated that the renoprotective effect may be due to inhibition of TGF-beta1 production. TGF-beta1 levels were measured in serum at baseline and 6 months from patients in the captopril trial. TGF-beta1 analyses were performed on all available patient sera. Analysis was performed between the percent change in TGF-beta1 levels during the first 6 months versus the percent change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the subsequent 2 years. TGF-beta1 levels increased by 11% (P = 0. 003) in the placebo group (n = 24), whereas there was a decrease of 14% (P = 0.01) in the captopril group (n = 34). There was an inverse correlation between the percent change in TGF-beta1 levels during the first 6 months and the percent change in GFR over the ensuing 2-year period in patients from both the placebo (r = -0.55, P = 0. 005) and captopril groups (r = -0.45, P = 0.008). In patients with initial GFR below 75 mL/min, there was an even stronger correlation in percent change in TGF-beta1 levels and percent change in GFR in both placebo (n = 9, r = -0.69, P = 0.03) and captopril groups (n = 21, r = -0.73, P = 0.0001). Our data suggest that captopril decreases TGF-beta1 levels in diabetic nephropathy and that changes in TGF-beta1 levels may predict the course of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "129": "Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. We undertook a study to assess the impact of assignment to different levels of blood pressure control on the course of type 1 diabetic nephropathy in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. We also examined the long-term course of this well-characterized cohort of patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy. One hundred twenty-nine patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy who had previously participated in the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibition in Diabetic Nephropathy Study who had a serum creatinine level less than 4.0 mg/dL were randomly assigned to a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) goal of 92 mm Hg or less (group I) or 100 to 107 mm Hg (group II). Patients received varying doses of ramipril as the primary therapeutic antihypertensive agent. All patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years. Outcome measures included iothalamate clearance, 24-hour creatinine clearance, creatinine clearance estimated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula, and urinary protein excretion. The average difference in MAP between groups was 6 mm Hg over the 24-month follow-up. The median iothalamate clearance in group I was 62 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at baseline and 54 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at the end of the study compared with a baseline of 64 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and final 58 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in group II. There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of decline in renal function between groups. There was a significant difference in follow-up total urinary protein excretion between group I (535 mg/24 h) and group II (1,723 mg/24 h; P = 0.02). Thirty-two percent of 126 patients achieved a final total protein excretion less than 500 mg/24 h. Patients from groups I and II had equivalent rates of adverse events. In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy, the MAP goal should be 92 mm Hg or less for optimal renoprotection, if defined as including decreased proteinuria. With the combination of ACE inhibition and intensive blood pressure control, many patients can achieve regression or apparent remission of clinical evidence of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "130": "The effect of insulin on the vasoconstriction induced by norepinephrine is presently controversial. Therefore, the aims of our study were: (1) to evaluate the effect of low- and high-dose insulin on the concentration-response curve to norepinephrine in small resistance arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) before and after the development of hypertension, and (2) to evaluate the effects of antihypertensive treatment on vascular response to insulin and norepinephrine. Fifty-six rats were included in the study. Six SHR were treated with enalapril and 6 with candesartan cilexetil from the 4th to the 12th week of age, while 10 WKY and 14 SHR were kept untreated. Two additional groups of 10 untreated SHR and 10 WKY were killed at 4 weeks of age, in a prehypertensive phase. Mesenteric small arteries were dissected and mounted on a micromyograph. A dose-response curve to norepinephrine was performed at cumulative concentrations in the presence or absence of low- and high-dose insulin. We found that only high-dose insulin increased the vascular response to norepinephrine in 12-week-old SHR, but not in 4-week-old SHR or in age-matched WKY. The increased responsiveness to norepinephrine disappeared after preincubation of the vessels with a selective inhibitor of endothelin-1 type A receptors. After antihypertensive treatment with enalapril or candesartan cilexetil, the potentiation of the vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine was abolished. In conclusion, insulin at high, nonphysiological doses seems to induce an increase in the reactivity to norepinephrine in mesenteric small arteries of SHR, possibly mediated by a local production of endothelin-1. Antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker may normalize this altered response. This mechanism may be relevant in the development of hypertension in SHR.", 
    "131": "The clinical utility of cyclosporin A (CyA) as an immunosuppressive agent has been significantly limited by the frequent occurrence of chronic nephrotoxicity, characterised by tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal impairment. The pathogenesis of this condition remains poorly understood, but has been postulated to be due to either direct cytotoxicity or indirect injury secondary to chronic renal vasoconstriction. Using primary cultures of human proximal tubule cells (PTCs) and renal cortical fibroblasts (CFs) as an in vitro model of the tubulointerstitium, we have been able to demonstrate that clinically relevant concentrations of CyA are directly toxic to these cells and promote fibrogenesis by a combination of suppressed matrix metalloproteinase activity and augmented fibroblast collagen synthesis. The latter effect occurs secondary to the ability of CyA to stimulate autocrine secretion of insulin-like growth factor-I by CFs and paracrine secretion of transforming growth factor-beta(1) by PTCs. Many of these pro-fibrotic mechanisms are completely reversed by concurrent administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, which has proven efficacy in preventing chronic CyA nephropathy in vivo. These studies highlight the unique potential that human renal cell cultures offer for studying the role of local cytokine networks in tubulointerstitial disease and for developing more effective treatment strategies which specifically target fibrogenic growth factor activity following nephrotoxic injuries.", 
    "132": "(1) In trials involving hypertensive non diabetic patients under 65, some diuretics and betablockers have prevented strokes, without conferring protection from coronary events or death. In one trial captopril had an effect comparable to that of diuretics or betablockers in terms of overall cardiovascular prevention, but was a little less effective in preventing strokes. (2) In trials involving hypertensive subjects over 65, some diuretics and betablockers have reduced the risk of stroke, coronary events, heart failure, and death. In one trial a diuretic was superior to a betablocker in terms of preventive efficacy and adverse effects. Nitrendipine, in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, prevented strokes in one trial. (3) In a trial involving hypertensive diabetic patients, captopril and atenolol reduced the risk of stroke, heart failure and worsening of retinal disease, without preventing coronary events or death. In two trials coronary events were more frequent on dihydropyridine than on an angiotensin-coverting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. (4) In one trial a diuretic reduced the risk of relapse after stroke, even in patients without severe hypertension.", 
    "133": "We examined the effects of enalapril and 4'-[(1, 4'-dimethyl-2'-propyl-[2,6'-bi-1H-enzimidazole]-1'-yl)methyl]-[1, 1'-biphenyl]-2-carboxylic acid (BIBR-277), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on contractile dysfunction in the stunned myocardium. Dogs were subjected to 20-min ligation of the coronary artery, followed by 60-min reperfusion. Saline, enalapril (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg), or BIBR-277 (3 mg/kg) was injected i.v. 10 min before ligation. D-Arginyl-L-arginlyl-L-prolyl-trans-4-hydroxy-L-prolylglycyl -3-(2-thi enyl)-L-alanyl-L-seryl-D-1,2,3, 4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarbonyl-L-(2alpha, 3beta, 7abeta)-octahydro-1H-indole-2-carbonyl-L-arginine (Hoe-140), a bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist, at 300 microg/kg was injected i. v. 10 min before drug injection. Contractile function was assessed on the basis of percentage segment shortening (%SS). ATP levels were measured in 60-min reperfused hearts. %SS significantly decreased during ischemia, and recovered during reperfusion, although the %SS was significantly less than the pre-ischemic level. Both enalapril at either dose and BIBR-277 significantly enhanced %SS recovery during reperfusion, an effect which was associated with a tendency toward energy preservation. Hoe-140 completely abolished the effect of enalapril at either dose, while it did not modify that of BIBR-277. Inhibition of angiotensin II formation and bradykinin breakdown may be separately related to the improvement of myocardial stunning.", 
    "134": "Cystinuria, an inherited disease, is clinically diagnosed by detecting cystine in urine. A colorimetric method using sodium cyanide and sodium nitroprusside is a simple qualitative test used to detect cystinuria. Several colorimetric methods have been proposed for quantitative analysis of cystine; however, we found that none of them were satisfactory because the results were not reproducible. The causes of non-reproducible results were: (1) insufficient reduction time for conversion of cystine to cysteine, and (2) the interference of creatinine. In this report, we present a method to quantitate cystine in urine. We also found that ascorbic acid and ferric chloride, but not zinc chloride, interfered with the color reaction. Using this method, 15 normal urine samples (10 males and 5 females) and 12 cystine stone forming patients' (5 males and 7 females) urine were analyzed. The method was compared to commercially available urine controls. Only captopril showed a dose dependent response and color intensity at 521 nm. Thiola and D-penicillamine showed little effect on cystine determination.", 
    "135": "Although the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with ventricular systolic dysfunction are well documented, historically, a large proportion of patients have not received optimal therapy. Published studies to describe the trends in ACE inhibitor utilization and determinants of their use were reviewed. In recent years the number of patients treated with ACE inhibitors has increased; however, a relatively small proportion of these patients received adequate therapeutic dosages. Attention to factors that impair proper use of these agents is essential to realize improved outcomes in these patients.", 
    "136": "A retrospective review of the cases of congestive heart failure admitted to Holberton Hospital in Antigua in 1995 and 1996 was undertaken. Two hundred and ninety-three (293) patients were identified by International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) coding as having congestive cardiac failure in the period but only 138 charts were either available or fitted the definition of congestive cardiac failure and these provided the basis for this analysis. The average age of patients admitted for congestive cardiac failure was 69 years (range: 5 months to 99 years), and 63% were female. the aetiology of congestive cardiac failure was hypertension (41%), ischaemia (33%), valvular (12%), alcohol related (2%), idiopathic (5%) and mixed (7%). Treatment included diuretics (95%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (78%), digoxin (75%), nitrates (34%), calcium channel blockers (25%), other vasodilators (7%) and antiarrhythmics (5%). Of those with congestive heart failure, diabetes was present in 38%, atrial fibrillation in 19%, renal insufficiency in 17%, elevated cholesterol in 11%, obesity in 9% and tobacco use in 7%. The in-hospital mortality in the 2-year period was 17.4% (females 15%, males 22%, 11% < 65 years, 20% > 65 years, 14% for those with 1 to 3 admissions and 83% for those with > 3 admissions, 19% for those with atrial fibrillation and 16% for those without). The prevalence of congestive cardiac failure utilizing the data analysed in this study (138 patients) was 0.21% of the population of the island state but based on the discharge diagnosis using ICD-10 coding it was 0.5%; it was 1% in the 40 to 65-year-age group and 4% in those > 65 years of age. The patients in this study represented only those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes III and IV, hence the true prevalence would be higher than recorded here.

Most often this paraneoplastic syndrome represents the first symptom of an occult neoplasia in an advanced stage. We present the case of an 83 year-old patient with digital ischemia and gangrenous fingertips in association with a latent adenocarcinoma of the uterus and metastatic involvement of the paraaortal lymph nodes. Acute occurrence of digital ischemia and gangrene without pathological laboratory findings and negative past medical history concerning cardiovascular-induced emboli, arteriosclerotic occlusion, or rheumatologic and autoimmune diseases should suggest this paraneoplastic syndrome and lead to thorough search for an underlying tumor.", 
    "138": "The \"Myocardial Infarction Registry\" in Germany (MIR) is a multicenter and prospective registry of consecutively included, unselected patients with acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of MIR is to document the actual praxis of decision making and prescribing of an optimized infarction therapy in AMI patients. Optimized infarction therapy is defined as the combination of reperfusion therapy and ASS, betablocker, and ACE inhibitor.14,598 patients with acute myocardial infarction were included between 12/96 and 5/98 in 217 hospitals throughout Germany. 68% of the patients were male; mean age was 67 years. The prehospital delay time was 195 minutes in median, the first ECG was diagnostic in 66% of the patients. A reperfusion therapy was applied in 46.1% of the patients (thrombolysis 36.2%, primary PTCA 9.9%). During the acute phase, the following adjunctive therapy was used: ASS in 90.3%, betablockers in 53.8%, and ACE inhibitors in 52.5%. Intrahospital mortality was 15.4%. Compared to hospitals without cardiologists, the hospitals with cardiologist had a lower intrahospital mortality (13.8% versus 16.1%; p < 0.001). Reasons are the more frequent use of a reperfusion therapy by cardiologists (54.3% versus 42.3%; p < 0. 001) and the availability of a catheter laboratory with PTCA facilities.A lower intrahospital mortality was associated with each therapy of the optimized infarction therapy: reperfusion therapy (odds ratio 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5-0.8), ASS (odds ratio 0.6; 95% CI: 0. 5-0.8), betablocker (odds ratio 0.6; 95% CI: 0.5-0.7) and ACE inhibitor (odds ratio: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4-0.7). However, patients with poor initial prognosis - such as cardiogenic shock, hypotension and/or bradycardia - could not benefit from the orally adjunctive therapy. This fact may have led to an overestimation of the influence on intrahospital mortality. In representative communal German hospitals, a reperfusion therapy in combination with an optimized adjunctive therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction is associated with a reduction in intrahospital mortality. Compared to previous registries, the application of betablockers and ACE inhibitors was clearly increased. Reasons could be the participation in a quality registry, the obligation to document why a therapy has not been given and repeated and intensified education of the treating physicians.Thus, the mainly communal hospitals in Germany are increasingly following recommendations about the early treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction registries such as MIR reflect daily prescribing habits in hospitals and describe the implementation of the results of randomized trials into daily routine.", 
    "139": "1. The role of angiotensin (Ang)II in and the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the regulation of sympathetic neural activity were examined in humans. 2. We measured baseline values of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and its reflex inhibition in 28 patients with essential hypertension with elevated plasma renin activity (PRA; > 1.0 ng/mL per h = 0.28 ng/L per s) before and after either acute or chronic oral administration of an ACE inhibitor or placebo and in 20 normotensive subjects before and after infusion of either AngII (5 ng/kg per min = 4.8 pmol/kg per min) or vehicle (5% dextrose). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded from the tibial nerve and its reflex inhibition was evaluated during pressor responses to bolus injection of phenylephrine (2 micrograms/kg, i.v.). 3. Blood pressure was significantly decreased (P < 0.01) after the acute oral administration of captopril (25 mg), accompanied by a slight increase in MSNA in patients with essential hypertension compared with control patients who received placebo administration. Reflex changes in MSNA were significantly augmented after oral administration of captopril (-4.1 +/- 0.5 vs -6.2 +/- 0.6%/mmHg, respectively; P < 0.01), with a significant reduction of plasma AngII, while they were not affected by placebo administration. 4. In contrast, acute AngII infusion was accompanied by decreases in both PRA and MSNA in normotensive subjects. Reflex changes in MSNA were significantly reduced after AngII infusion (-11.0 +/- 0.8 vs -7.4 +/- 1.0%/mmHg, respectively; P < 0.01) but not after vehicle alone. 5. Chronic ACE inhibition by 12 week oral imidapril administration (5-10 mg/day) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased baseline values of MSNA, which were accompanied by a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the reflex inhibition of MSNA, while plasma concentrations of noradrenaline were unaffected. 6. These results indicate that AngII blunts reflex inhibition of sympathetic neural activity and that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by an ACE inhibitor augments reflex regulation of sympathetic neural activity and reduces baseline values in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "140": "MRI myocardial tagging is now a well-developed method for evaluation of regional myocardial contraction. A series of progressively more refined imaging strategies, combined with advances in analytic strategies have provided a strong armamentarium of methods. Important insights into normal human physiology of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function have been developed using one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses of myocardial deformation. In disease states, improved understanding and detection of early alterations in myocardial function in hypertensive heart disease has been possible. In addition, improved understanding of effects of ischemia and infarction on regional function has been possible. Further, after acute myocardial infarction, clearer definition of the natural history of contractile dysfunction in the infarct region and the zone adjacent to the infarct have been possible. Similarly, effects on regional function of a number of important pharmacologic agents used for treatment, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers have been characterized. In the cardiomyopathies, myocardial tagging has permitted more reliable assessment of heterogeneity of segmental function, especially in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Finally, initial applications of myocardial tagging to assessment of right ventricular regional function in hypertrophied hearts with and without major congenital abnormalities have generated advances in understanding of effects of hypertrophy on right ventricular function.J.

    "141": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to protect against stroke in hypertensive rats and to improve neurological outcome after cerebral ischemia in normotensive rats. The present study was designated to test the hypothesis that blockade of brain AT(1) receptors improves the recovery from focal cerebral ischemia and reduces expression of AP-1 transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun, which have been associated with programmed cell death and neurodegeneration.", 
    "142": "Experiments were carried out in normotensive male Wistar rats. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion lasting for 90 minutes and followed by reperfusion. The selective AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan was infused intracerebroventricularly over a 5-day period before the induction of ischemia at a dose that inhibited brain but not vascular AT(1) receptors. Twenty-four hours after ischemia, neurological outcome was evaluated and expression of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins in the brain was studied immunocytochemically.", 
    "143": "Focal brain ischemia resulted in a strong induction of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins in the cortex, which positively correlated with the degree of neurological deficits. Treatment of rats with irbesartan significantly improved neurological outcome of focal cerebral ischemia when compared with the vehicle-treated group and markedly reduced the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins in the cortex on the ligated side of the brain. Irbesartan pretreatment completely abolished the ischemia-induced c-Fos expression in the hippocampus.", 
    "144": "The present study shows a relationship between c-Fos and c-Jun expression and neurological outcome after focal brain ischemia.

    "146": "To determine the short-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on hemodynamics and circulating levels of norepinephrine, angiotensin, and bradykinin, responses to enalaprilat and perindoprilat were examined at doses of 0.03, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg in permanently instrumented conscious dogs with pacing-induced heart failure (right ventricular pacing, 240-250 beats/min, 3 weeks). All doses of the two inhibitors produced similar decrease in mean aortic pressure and increase in cardiac output. Neither inhibitor affected plasma norepinephrine level. Both compounds induced a similar 60-80% decrease in blood angiotensin II level, a similar two- to eightfold increase in blood angiotensin I level, and a 80-95% decrease in the angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio. There were also a fourfold to 10-fold increase in blood bradykinin-(1-9) level, a twofold increase in blood bradykinin-(1-7) level, and a 70-85% decrease in bradykinin-(1-7)/bradykinin-(1-9) ratio. In addition, the changes in total peripheral resistance induced by the two ACE inhibitors were weakly but significantly correlated with the changes in blood angiotensin II or blood bradykinin-(1-9). Thus whatever the specificity of enalaprilat and perindoprilat, both inhibitors produced similar acute hemodynamic effects in dogs with heart failure, which was associated with marked decrease in circulating angiotensin II level and increase in bradykinin-(1-9) level. This study, which measures for the first time in heart failure the blood bradykinin level after ACE inhibitors, indicates, in concert with angiotensin II reduction, a role for increased bradykinin-(1-9) level in mediating short-term hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibition in this model of heart failure.", 
    "147": "Renin is produced by the kidney and secreted into the systemic circulation. However, its biochemical and physiological role of regulating renal blood flow with changing renal perfusion pressure (RPP) is not fully understood. In this study, the function of the intrarenal renin for production of angiotensin (Ang) I and maintenance of vascular tone was evaluated in dogs under normal conditions and when the kidney was perfused at low RPP. The dog left kidney was perfused first at normal (100 mm Hg) and then at low (30 mm Hg) RPP in the presence or absence of the renin inhibitor ciprokiren (3 mg/kg, i.v.). Both hemodynamic and biochemical parameters were measured. Lowering RPP markedly reduced left renal blood flow and elevated left renal vascular resistance. These effects were prevented by ciprokiren, which blocked the intrarenal production of Ang I. Lowering RPP increased the renal venous/ arterial ratio from 1.4+/-0.1 to 3.6+/-0.3 for plasma renin activity and from 2.4+/-0.2 to 9.8+/-1.1 for Ang I, but did not change the venous/arterial ratio for Ang II. The net renal venous conversion rate of Ang I to Ang II decreased from 0.22 to 0.09 after RPP was lowered, whereas the conversion rate in arterial blood was 1.35 and did not decrease significantly. Our results demonstrated the importance of intrarenal renin-angiotensin system for Ang I production and for the maintenance of the vascular tone, especially at low RPP. Our study also shows the limited capacity for Ang I conversion in the renal vasculature in vivo.",

The arterial 5-HT2A receptor mRNA level in artery was 25-fold (p < 0.01) higher than the venous level, and the arterial 5-HT1B receptor mRNA level was at least 7000-fold (p < 0.005) higher the venous level.", 
    "149": "Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene expression was studied in a seasonal hibernator, the diurnal ground squirrel, Spermophilus lateralis. RNA transcripts of 2.7 and 2.9 kb hybridizing to an HSP70 cDNA were expressed in both brain and peripheral tissues of pre-hibernation euthermic animals; higher levels of expression were observed during the day than during nighttime samples. A decline in the expression of both transcripts occurred in all tissues examined during hibernation that remained low throughout the hibernation season, including the interbout euthermic periods and regardless of time of day. Quantitative comparisons showed pre-hibernation nighttime HSP70 expression to be as low as that observed during hibernation, despite the drastic increase in metabolic state and nearly 30 degrees C difference in body temperature. In contrast to HSP70, some mRNAs, such as beta-actin and HSP60, remained relatively constant, while others, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, increased in specific tissues during the hibernation season. These results indicate that the expression of a highly conserved gene involved in protection from cellular stress, HSP70, can vary with an animal's arousal state.",

Resting atrioventricular plane displacement improved in the combined ramipril groups vs the placebo group: 0.2+/-0.8 vs -0.2+/-1.3 mm, P<0.05.Conclusion Six months ramipril treatment in patients with stable ischaemic heart disease and preserved left ventricular systolic function improved resting left ventricular function and reduced the exercise induced diastolic filling abnormalities usually seen in these patients.",

Six-month rehospitalization rates were also similar. Although 30-day mortality rate did not differ between men and women, 6-month and 1-year mortality rates were lower in women after age adjustment (relative risk for 6-month death 0.81, 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.95). In multivariable analysis, sex differences in mortality rate were reduced (relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence intervals, 0.75-1.08).

Family physicians were less likely than cardiologists to rate measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction as \"very important\" for patients with new CHF, less likely to order an echocardiogram or test for ischemia, and much less likely to identify diastolic dysfunction as a cause of CHF. Family physicians were more likely to prescribe digoxin when it was not indicated (diastolic dysfunction) and less likely to prescribe digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor when they were indicated (moderately to severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction). Family physicians expressed more concern over the risks of ACE inhibitors in patients with blood pressure of 100/70 mm Hg or serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL and were less likely to prescribe an ACE inhibitor in these settings. Family physicians overestimated the risks of warfarin use for atrial fibrillation and were therefore less likely to prescribe warfarin.",

    "176": "The major objectives of managed care are particularly applicable to hypertension, a very common disease that affects about 30% of the adult population. Although managed care organizations know that adequate blood pressure control has a considerable impact on reducing hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, managed care is, at present, doing a generally poor job of monitoring antihypertensive therapy. One of the major reasons for this is the difficulty in gathering the necessary data from administrative sources; only chart review, which is very costly and very time consuming, can provide the data needed. The value of disease management lies in its capacity to optimize clinical and economic outcomes as well as to improve service and quality of life, using inputs such as cost, time, clinical resources, and patient satisfaction. Disease management programs are instituted because they can lead to improved quality of life and reduced costs. While the focus in managed care has traditionally been on promoting risk modification behavior, providing patient education, and encouraging medication compliance, the treatment of hypertension itself has not been a major focus in most disease management programs. Measuring the effectiveness of the hypertension treatment is, however, one of the proposed measures for the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS 2000) to profile health plan quality. From a managed care perspective, the potential benefits of combination therapy for hypertension include improved blood pressure control and improved patient compliance as a result of needing fewer pills and experiencing fewer side effects with low-dose therapy. Among the obstacles to combination therapy in the managed care setting are the addition of the combinations onto a formulary and lack of acceptance among physicians. Fixed-dose combination therapy with a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor can potentially reduce pharmacy costs if given to patients who are taking both drugs independently and to patients who are taking a calcium channel blocker but should probably also be taking an ACE inhibitor (e.g., patients with diabetes or congestive heart failure). A mini-pharmacoeconomic analysis based on claims data over a 6-month period from HMO Colorado, a health maintenance organization, shows that switching patients on dual therapy with a calcium channel blocker and an ACE inhibitor to 1-pill combination therapy with both agents can result in substantial cost savings.", 
    "177": "Heart failure (HF) is a common and expensive cardiovascular disease, in economic terms as well as in lives lost. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to significantly reduce mortality and hospitalisation in HF. However, recent surveys show that the prescription rate of ACE inhibitors for HF is far below what is considered to be optimal. Furthermore, prescribed dosages are usually lower than those recommended based on evidence from clinical trials. This article estimates the consequences, both economic and human, of underprescribing ACE inhibitors in patients with HF. The indication for prescribing an ACE inhibitor varies, and clinical trials have included different categories of patients; it is inappropriate to assess costs in all eligible patients without taking these factors into account. Therefore, we analysed the data with respect to 4 different groups: (i) asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD)--an early stage leading to chronic HF; (ii) chronic HF; and post-myocardial infarction (MI) LVSD differentiated into (iii) post-MI asymptomatic LVSD and (iv) post-MI chronic HF. We also estimated the cost effectiveness of adding an ACE inhibitor to the treatment of patients with HF for whom an ACE inhibitor is not currently prescribed. If only patient populations in which large trials have shown a significant effect of ACE inhibition on mortality are included in the analysis (i.e. excluding asymptomatic patients with LVSD), increasing the number of Swedish patients receiving an ACE inhibitor could save in excess of 3700 lives each year, in addition to reducing the annual number of hospitalisations by 8400. The additional cost would be 101.5 million Swedish kronor (SEK), a cost per life saved of SEK27 200. Chronic HF is the most cost-effective patient population to treat, generating cost savings under certain assumptions. A further 6700 hospitalisations can be avoided should the use of ACE inhibitors be extended to asymptomatic patients with LVSD. Increasing dosages to those used in the large clinical trials may generate additional savings in lives and hospitalisations. In conclusion, the use of ACE inhibitors in HF and LVSD has clearly been proven to be cost effective, and compares favourably with the cost effectiveness of treating hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia. At present, however, ACE inhibitors are not optimally utilised. Given the increasingly constrained resources for healthcare, every effort should be made to increase the use of cost-effective treatments, such as ACE inhibitors in chronic HF and post-MI LVSD.", 
    "178": "We have compared at the enzymological level pulmonary angiotensin I-converting enzymes (ACE) purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from four mammalians species: pig, rat, monkey and human. Using both substrates hippuryl-histidyl-leucine and furylacryloyl-phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine in steady-state conditions, all the ACEs exhibited Michaelis kinetics with identical Michaelis constants, maximal velocities, optimal pH and optimal activating chloride-concentrations. The apparent inhibitory constant was higher for Captopril than for Enalaprilat and even more so for Ramiprilat irrespective of the origin of ACE and the substrate used. Although these inhibitors have been described as competitive inhibitors, Lineweaver-Burk plots were not in accordance with a simple competitive model; moreover, Dixon plots were rather characteristic of non-competitive inhibition. These data emphasize the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors act with mixed-type inhibition, which is consistent with their slow-tight binding to the ACE active center, also with binding of chloride on a critical lysine residue leading to a potential conformational change, and finally with the fact that ACE has two domains, each bearing one catalytic site. On the other hand, as identical kinetic parameters were obtained on the different ACE preparations, results from animal models should allow the extrapolation to humans, in particular for investigations on both renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems, and on their inhibition.",

Macrocyclic compounds in which the alpha carbon of the succinyl hydroxamate is linked to the side chain of the P2' amino acid were found to be good inhibitors of aminopeptidase, but not of neprilysin or thermolysin. Compounds of neither series were found to be significant inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme or carboxypeptidase A.", 
    "180": "The hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes exposed to mechanical stretch is assumed to depend on the release of angiotensin (Ang) II from these cells.

Medium and cell lysate were collected 5 days later or after exposure of the cells to cyclic stretch for 24 h. Prorenin, renin and angiotensinogen were measured by enzyme-kinetic assay; Ang I and Ang II were measured by radioimmunoassay after SepPak extraction and HPLC separation.", 
    "182": "Prorenin, but none of the other RAS components, could be detected in the medium of both cell types. However, its levels were low and the Ang I-generating activity corresponding with these low prorenin levels could not be inhibited by the specific rat renin inhibitor CH-732, suggesting that it was most likely due to bovine and/or horse prorenin sequestered from the serum-containing medium to which the cells had been exposed prior to the serum-free period. When incubated with Ang I, both myocytes and fibroblasts generated Ang II in a captopril-inhibitable manner. Myocyte and fibroblast cell lysates did not contain prorenin, renin, angiotensinogen, Ang I or Ang II in detectable quantities. Stretch increased myocyte protein synthesis by 20%, but was not accompanied by Ang II release into the medium.", 
    "183": "Cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts do not synthesize renin, prorenin or angiotensinogen in concentrations that are detectable or, it not detectable, high enough to result in Ang II concentrations of physiological relevance. These cells do synthesize ACE, thereby allowing the synthesis of Ang II at cardiac tissue sites when renin and angiotensinogen are provided via the circulation. Ang II is not a prerequisite to observe a hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes following stretch.", 
    "184": "We have reported that angiotensin II AT1 receptors are upregulated and that there are no AT2 receptors in the ventricles of cardiomyopathic hamsters. Since the upregulation was present even when no histological lesions were detectable, these results suggested that angiotensin II plays a role in the genesis/maintenance of this pathology. A survival study was conducted to compare the effects of an angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (L), to those of a placebo (P). Since the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril (Q) has been shown to have beneficial effects in this animal model, a Q group was included.",

Inbred control hamsters (CHF 148, n = 180) were treated with P or L (100 mg/kg/day) as controls. Animals were sacrificed at intervals to evaluate cardiac hypertrophy. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess differences in survival.", 
    "186": "High-dose L had no effects on the survival of control hamsters. There was an unexpected dose-dependent decrease in the survival of cardiomyopathics treated with L (low-dose, P = 0.14; high-dose, P = 0.0015) compared to an increase with Q (P = 0.0003). Cardiac hypertrophy compared to P was increased with L but significantly decreased with Q in cardiomyopathics.", 
    "187": "In this model, losartan did not improve survival compared to placebo and quinapril and, if anything, increased mortality.

    "188": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reported to prevent neointimal formation after balloon injury in animal models, but in most prospective studies in humans, ACE inhibitors failed to prevent restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The ACE genotype assigned by an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism is known to affect the potency of ACE inhibitors in several renal diseases. The authors attempted to clarify whether the effect of ACE inhibitors on restenosis might be modified by the ACE genotype. A total of 126 patients was randomly and prospectively assigned to the control group and the imidapril group. In the imidapril group, patients received 5 mg imidapril daily, starting 1 day before PTCA and continuing for 3 to 6 months. Forty-six control (65 vessels) and 32 imidapril patients (43 vessels) completed the study. The minimal lumen diameter before and after the procedure did not differ significantly among the groups with the three genotypes (II, ID, and DD) in both the control and imidapril groups. Late luminal loss during the follow-up period was not related to the ACE genotype in the control group but was significantly related in the imidapril group (II, 0.63+/- 0.19 mm; ID + DD, 1.12+/-0.14 mm, p<0.05). Furthermore, in the II genotype, imidapril significantly reduced late loss and restenosis rate as defined by most of the frequently used definitions. In conclusion the ACE I/D polymorphism may influence the effect of ACE inhibitors in preventing restenosis after PTCA.", 
    "189": "Day-activity rhythms of heart rate and blood pressure are thought to be mediated mainly through the sympathetic nervous system and may have greater amplitudes in patients with hypertension owing to increased daytime and largely normal nighttime values. Drug-induced nighttime hypotension in patients with chronic hypertension has been associated with the precipitation of cardiac failure and a fall in cerebral flow. The authors examined the effects of a single dose and of a 4-week treatment with different classes of antihypertensive drugs on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in 10 patients with mild hypertension. Data were assessed by polynomial analysis (Harvard Graphics 3). A single oral dose of enalapril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, carvedilol 25 mg, and celiprolol 200 mg produced a mean reduction of 24-hour ABP compared to placebo of, respectively, 24/11, 11/5, 13/6, and 12/5 mm Hg (p values between <0.02 and <0.001). With enalapril, amlodipine, and carvedilol, between-subject variability contributed significantly to the overall variability in the measurements (p values between 0.05 and 0.01 versus zero), whereas with celiprolol this was not so. Although the beta blockers reduced daytime blood pressures similarly to the ACE inhibitor or the calcium channel blocker, they did not reduce nighttime blood pressures. These results were confirmed by an 8-week crossover trial comparing enalapril 10 mg daily with celiprolol 200 mg daily in the same group of patients. The authors conclude (1) that beta blockers produce a more stable reduction of blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension less affected by pressor effects through the sympathetic nervous system; (2) that beta blockers, unlike ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, do not give rise to nighttime hypotension in this category of patients; and (3) that the selective beta blocker celiprolol may even perform better in these respects than the nonselective beta blocker carvedilol.", 
    "190": "Immobilized angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was utilized as an affinity ligand to isolate a naturally occurring ACE binding protein from normal human serum. The enzyme was isolated from solubilized bovine lung membrane preparations by lisinopril affinity chromatography. It had an estimated molecular weight of 180 000 and was recognized by the anti-ACE antibody for the rabbit testicular ACE in immunoblots. ACE was immobilized onto epoxy Sepharose as well as Affi-Gel 15. Immobilized ACE on Affi-Gel 15 had higher catalytic activity (0.176 U/mL) compared with the enzyme immobilized on epoxy Sepharose (0.00005 U/mL). Immobilized ACE served as the affinity ligand for the identification of the ACE binding protein in human serum with an estimated molecular weight of 14 000 as observed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The identification and further characterization of ACE binding proteins in serum and tissues may facilitate the greater understanding of the endogenous regulation of this key enzyme, which is involved in blood pressure homeostasis.", 
    "191": "Several mechanisms other than the inhibition of systemic and local formation of angiotensin II (Ang II) have been proposed to play a role in mediating the hypotensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In the present study, we measured plasma levels of nitric oxide (NO) and the related vasoactive factors bradykinin, 6-keto prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto PGF1alpha) a stable metabolite of prostacyclin, and cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) before and after a 4-week treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in 17 patients with essential hypertension. Plasma NO levels were measured by the Griess method after conversion of nitrate to nitrite. Long-term lisinopril treatment significantly reduced blood pressure and increased plasma NO and 6-keto PGF1alpha. The treatment also tended to increase plasma levels of bradykinin and cGMP, but not to a significant extent. The posttreatment NO level was inversely correlated with posttreatment systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure (n = 17, r= -.68, P< .01, n = 17, r= -.54, P < .05, and n = 17, r= -.66, P< .01, respectively). The posttreatment bradykinin level was also modestly correlated with posttreatment systolic and mean blood pressure (n = 17, r = -.51, P < .05 and n = 17, r = -.55, P < .05, respectively). In contrast, posttreatment 6-keto PGF1alpha and cGMP levels were not correlated with posttreatment systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure. These findings raise the possibility that increased formation of NO and bradykinin, as well as inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, contribute to the hypotensive effect of the ACE inhibitor observed in our hypertensive patients.", 
    "192": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are antihypertensive agents, that inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, resulting in smooth-muscle relaxation and a reduction of vascular resistance. Recently, it has been suggested that ACE inhibitors improve insulin resistance in diabetic patients. To investigate the effect of an ACE inhibitor on insulin sensitivity, insulin signaling, and circulation, imidapril was administered orally or intraduodenally to Zucker fatty rats. Oral administration of imidapril improved insulin sensitivity based on the results of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a decrease in urinary glucose secretion. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity associated with hepatic insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in the insulin-stimulated condition was significantly enhanced 110% without a significant alteration in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the imidapril-treated group. In muscle, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 in the insulin-stimulated condition were enhanced 70% and 20%, respectively, in the imidapril-treated group. In contrast, an alteration of the IRS-2 pathway was observed only in liver; a significant insulin-induced increase in the IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase over the basal level was observed in the imidapril-treated group but not in the control. In addition, treatment with imidapril was shown to significantly reduce blood pressure and increase blood flow in the liver and muscle. These results suggest that the ACE inhibitor imidapril may improve insulin sensitivity not only by acting directly on the insulin signaling pathway but also by increasing blood flow in tissues via normalization of vascular resistance, a major cause of hypertension.",

We developed a novel program, SCAMPI (statistical classification of activities of molecules for pharmacophore identification), for this purpose by combining a fast conformation search with recursive partitioning, a data-mining technique, which can easily handle large data sets. The pharmacophore identification process is designed to run recursively, and the conformation spaces are resampled under the constraints of the evolving pharmacophore model. This program is capable of deriving pharmacophores from a data set of 1000-2000 compounds, with thousands of conformations generated for each compound and in less than 1 day of computational time. For two test data sets, the identified pharmacophores are consistent with the known results from the literature.", 
    "198": "A total of 187 heart failure patients aged 65-92 years, with pretreatment serum creatinine levels below 200 mumol/l, were monitored for more than 12 months on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. Optimal ACE inhibitor dosage was found in 27% of patients, while a significant deterioration in renal function, characterised by > 20% increase in serum creatinine to > 200 mumol/l, occurred in 25 patients. This was most closely attributable to ACE inhibitor treatment per se (implying co-existence of bilateral renal artery stenosis) in only four cases, including one in whom renal deterioration was reproducible on inadvertent rechallenge. In the other 21, renal deterioration was attributable to diuretic-related blood volume depletion (two cases), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (two cases), obstructive uropathy (two cases), preterminal renal shutdown (two cases), and the interaction between diuretic and ACE inhibitor dosage (including long-acting vs short-acting drugs) (13 cases). This study could serve as the basis for future comparisons of ACE-inhibitor-related renal deterioration when the entry requirement is optimal ACE inhibitor dosage.", 
    "199": "Angiotensin II (AngII) generation in response to vascular injury has long been assumed to influence neointimal proliferation contributing to restenosis. This concept has been supported by evidence that ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade effectively limits restenosis in the rat. On the other hand, ACE inhibition has proven ineffective in clinical trails. The present study examines the response of the porcine coronary artery after angioplasty in vitro and compares the actions of an ACE inhibitor to AngII receptor antagonists.", 
    "200": "Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, and the AngII receptor antagonists, losartan and PD123319, were evaluated for their ability to attenuate neointimal proliferation in a porcine organ culture model of coronary restenosis. The neointima was significantly increased by 300% after angioplasty compared to non-angioplasty controls. The AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, produced a significant reduction in neointimal index at 10(-5) mol/l, while its in vivo metabolite, EXP3174, reduced neointimal proliferation at 10(-6) mol/l. PD123319, a selective antagonist of the AT2 receptor, also restricted neointimal proliferation at 10(-5) mol/l. Treatment with captopril (10(-6) mol/l) increased the neointimal proliferation by approximately 200% after angioplasty.",

    "202": "In heart failure atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release in response to volume expansion is impaired while the renin-angiotensin system is activated. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that ANP release in heart failure is dependent on an activated angiotensin system.", 
    "203": "We studied the ANP and renin-angiotensin systems in a rat model of shunt-induced high-output heart failure, in which we rapidly increased circulating fluid volume with a 5 ml, hyperoncotic infusion, and evaluated the effects of acute inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme as well as of the blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptors on the ANP release and on renal excretory function.", 
    "204": "ANP and angiotensin II plasma concentrations prior to volume expansion were elevated (p < 0.05) in rats with aortocaval shunt compared to controls. The diuretic response to acute volume expansion (18.5 +/- 1.5 vs. 48.2 +/- 2.4 microliters/min, p < 0.001) was markedly blunted. ANP release was attenuated in rats with aortocaval shunt, as was the increase of its second messenger cGMP in plasma and urine. The blunted increase in ANP plasma levels was not due to depleted cardiac stores as cardiac ANP content, as well as ANP synthesis, were increased (p < 0.05). Acute inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme as well as blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptors restored ANP release in response to volume expansion (p < 0.01). Moreover, acute inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system completely normalized the diuretic response.", 
    "205": "Our data suggest that the ANP system is impaired in rats with aortocaval shunt. The activation of the angiotensin system contributes to the impairment of the ANP system. Acute inhibition of the angiotensin II system significantly improved the ability of the ANP system to respond to acute volume expansion. Our findings indicate a hitherto fore unappreciated interaction between both systems and suggest additional mechanisms for the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists in heart failure.", 
    "206": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) was shown to be an important risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis. Inhibition of Ang II action on the arterial wall by blocking its production with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or by blocking binding to its receptors on cells with antagonists was shown to attenuate atherogenesis in animal model of atherosclerosis. We questioned whether Ang II atherogenicity is related to a stimulatory effect of Ang II on macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis. Angiotensin II injected intraperitoneally once a day (0.1 ml of 10(-7) M per mouse) for a period of 30 days, to the apolipoprotein E deficient mice increased the atherosclerotic lesion area by 95% (P < 0.01 vs. control), compared to placebo-injected mice, with no significant effect on blood pressure or on plasma cholesterol levels. On using mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) that were harvested after intraperitoneally injection of Ang II, an increased rate of cellular cholesterol biosynthesis (measured as incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol) by up to 90% (P < 0.01 vs. control) was observed. In mice treated with the ACE inhibitor, Fosinopril (25 mg/kg per day) a reduction in their MPM's cholesterol synthesis by up to 70% (P < 0.01 vs. control) was obtained. In vitro studies in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM), in MPMs from control BALB/c mice, and in J-774 A.1 macrophage-like cell line demonstrated up to 44, 34 and 30% stimulation of macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis, respectively, following cell incubation with 10(-7) M Ang II for 18 h at 37 degrees C. The stimulatory effect of Ang II on macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis could be related to its interaction with the macrophage AT1 receptor, as Losartan (10(-5) M), an AT1 blocker, but not PD 123319 (10(-5) M), an AT2 blocker, prevented the stimulatory effect on macrophage cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, in cells that lack the AT1 receptor (RAW macrophages), Ang II did not increase cellular cholesterol synthesis. Ang II increased macrophage 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner in J-774 A.1 macrophages and in MPM. Losartan, the AT1 receptor antagonist clearly attenuated this mRNA induction. We thus conclude that Ang II stimulation of macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis is related to its interaction with the AT1 receptor, followed by stimulation of macrophage HMG CoA reductase gene expression, which leads to increased cellular cholesterol biosynthesis, and can possibly result in macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation.",

    "209": "Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that has been shown to improve hemodynamic parameters in patients with class III to IV heart failure when administered intravenously for < or =48 hours. This study examines the tolerability of long-term intravenous milrinone therapy and assesses its utility in allowing upward titration of oral vasodilator agents. A retrospective review of hospital records identified 63 patients who underwent hemodynamic monitoring and received intravenous milrinone for >24 hours in a critical care setting. Hemodynamics and medications were recorded before and after 24 hours of milrinone therapy. Additional medications, as well as any adverse events, were recorded throughout milrinone therapy. The mean dose of milrinone was 0.43 +/- 0.10 microg/kg/min, with a mean duration of 12 +/- 15 days (range 1 to 70). Therapy was continued for >48 hours in 89% of patients. After 24 hours of milrinone therapy, patients exhibited significant improvements in pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and cardiac index. When compared with baseline, significantly more patients received angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after 24 hours of milrinone and at the end of milrinone therapy (67% vs 86%, p <0.01). Likewise, significantly more patients also received oral hydralazine and/or nitrates at the end of milrinone therapy (38% vs 65%, p <0.01) when compared with baseline. The mean doses of most oral medications at the 3 time periods were similar. The ACE inhibitor dose was significantly higher at the end of milrinone therapy when compared with baseline, and hydralazine dose was significantly higher at the end of therapy when compared with 24 hours. Few adverse effects were noted, with only 10% of patients experiencing symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and 2 patients with significant hypotension requiring discontinuation of the drug. The adverse events were similar in the group of patients who received milrinone for > or =7 days compared with the entire cohort. Milrinone was well tolerated over the long term in a controlled inpatient setting, and allowed uptitration of oral vasodilator therapy.", 
    "210": "Quantitative structure activity relationships were formulated for a series of phosphoramidothioate (Ace) analogs. Ace II- and Ace IV-induced inhibition of fly-head AChE was influenced by the spatial configuration of the inhibitor. The 3D structure of a potent phosphoramidothioate such as methamidophos was such that its P-O(-)group interacted with the enzyme's 'oxy-anion hole', NH2+ group formed an H-bond with the enzyme's H-bonding site, and leaving group (-S) oriented toward the AChE 'gorge' opening. An alteration in its 3D structure also altered its toxicity. The k(i) for Ace II-induced inhibition of fly-AChE correlated with sterimol indices L1 (the substituent's length), B1 (minimum axis perpendicular to this length), and B3 (-90 degrees to B1) and Ebend. The k(i) for Ace IV-induced inhibition of fly-AChE correlated with dispersion, H-bond donor, and E(dihedral). Thus, the 3D characteristics of a substituent and molecular charge play a key role in the inhibition of fly-head AChE by phosphoramidothioate. LD50 for housefly exposed to Ace I, II, III, and IV analogs was governed by their electronic, topological, steric, and sterimol (steric effects of substituents) properties. Hydrophobic interaction either played a minor role or adversely affected their toxicity in housefly.", 
    "211": "Acute pulmonary edema (APE) is a common Emergency Department (ED) presentation requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). This study was undertaken to examine the effect of ED management on the need for ICU admission in patients with APE. ED records of APE patients were abstracted for patient age, prehospital and ED pharmacological treatment, diagnoses, airway interventions, and ICU length of stay (LOS). Statistical analysis was through multiple regression, logistic regression, chi-square, and ANOVA. One hundred eighty-one patients composed the study group. Pharmacological treatment included nitroglycerin (NTG), 147 patients (81%); morphine sulfate (MS), 88 (49%); loop diuretics (LD), 133 (73%); and captopril sublingual (CSL), 47 (26%). Use of CSL and MS were associated with opposing needs for ICU admission. MS use was associated with increased ICU admissions (odds ratio, 3.08; P = .002), whereas CSL use was associated with decreased ICU admissions (odds ratio, 0.29; P = .002). Morphine sulfate use also demonstrated an increased need for endotracheal intubation (ETI) (odds ratio, 5.04; P = .001), whereas CSL demonstrated a decreased need for ETI (odds ratio, 0.16; P = .008). Ninety-three patients required some form of respiratory support. Forty received noninvasive pressure support ventilation (NPSV) from a bilevel positive airway pressure system (BiPAP), and 60 received endotracheal intubation. Some patients received more than 1 form of respiratory support; all other patients received supplemental oxygen only. The ICU-LOS associated with different airway interventions were supplemental oxygen, 0.72 days; BiPAP, 1.48 days; and ETI, 3.70 days (P < .001). Specific ED pharmacological interventions are associated with a decreased need for ICU admission and endotracheal intubation in acute pulmonary edema patients, whereas use of noninvasive pressure support ventilation correlates with a reduction in the ICU length of stay for patients who do require critical care admission.", 
    "212": "High blood pressure values, diastolic and systolic, are associated with decreased renal function. This is particularly true when the diastolic blood pressure is higher than 90 mm Hg. Several studies showed that lowering of the blood pressure within the range of normotension according to the WHO causes a reduction in the rate of progression to terminal renal failure. These studies have led to recommendations to aim at a target blood pressure of approximately 125/75 mm Hg in the treatment of patients with glomerular diseases and particularly diabetic nephropathy with proteinuria >1 g/day. In contrast to these results, blood pressure values corresponding to the recommendation (</=125/75 mm Hg) of the JNC VI (see text) were achieved in 15% of the patients only. It has also been shown that at any given level of an average 24-hour blood pressure, patients with an insufficient decrease of the blood pressure during nighttime have a higher risk to progress to terminal renal failure. Thus it is very important to lower the nighttime blood pressure and to detect nighttime blood pressure increases using ambulatory blood pressure measurements.",

Previous studies have shown that rodents treated with high doses of troglitazone develop increased heart weight and increased interscapular brown fat. This study investigated cellular proliferation in heart and brown fat of troglitazone-treated mice as well as possible interactions with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (quinipril). B6C3F1 female mice were treated daily with either vehicle control, 125 mg/kg quinipril, 1,200 mg/kg troglitazone, or troglitazone/quinipril combination per os for up to 14 days. Four days before necropsy, mice were dosed with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) using osmotic pumps. Cell proliferation in heart, brown fat, and retroperitoneal white fat was investigated by means of light microscopic anti-BrdU immunolabeling techniques. Immunoelectron microscopy was used to determine the cell phenotypes and cellular distribution of BrdU label in heart and brown fat. Treatment with troglitazone for 2 wk resulted in increased heart and brown fat weights but in decreased white fat weight. Combination treatment with troglitazone and quinipril also resulted in decreased white fat weight compared with controls. Histologically, brown fat adipocytes in troglitazone- and troglitazone/quinipril-treated mice had coalescent lipid vacuoles and increased eosinophilia of the cytoplasm. White fat adipocytes in troglitazone- and troglitazone/quinipril-treated mice had decreased cell size and increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia. BrdU labeling revealed increased cell proliferation in troglitazone-treated hearts after 1 wk but did not reveal increased cell proliferation in quinipril- or troglitazone/quinipril-treated animals. Brown fat BrdU labeling after 1 wk was increased in troglitazone- and troglitazone/quinipril-treated mice. Ultrastructural anti-BrdU immunogold labeling demonstrated that troglitazone-treated heart and brown fat had greater populations of BrdU-labeled cells that were identified as endothelial cells. These results demonstrated that troglitazone-induced increased cardiac weight in mice can be prevented by quinipril and that increased cardiac weight coincides with early increased endothelial cell proliferation.", 
    "219": "The effects of captopril on glucose uptake, as well as morphological and functional changes of retinal pericytes, in a high-glucose medium were examined. Retinal pericytes were incubated in medium with 5 and 30 mM glucose and 30 mM glucose with 10(-6) to 10(-3) M captopril. Captopril decreased the cellular uptakes of d-glucose and alpha-methyl glucoside in the presence, but not in the absence, of sodium. The cellular size and contents of glucose, sorbitol, and fructose were increased in 30 mM glucose concomitant with the decreased thymidine, cellular DNA content, and ratios in glucose to sorbitol and to fructose, compared with those in 5 mM glucose. These changes observed in 30 mM glucose were reversed by 10(-4) M captopril. These data suggest that the suppression of d-glucose uptake through a sodium-coupled glucose transporter by captopril may attenuate the swelling and loss of pericytes observed in the early stage of diabetic retinopathy.",

GH effects were examined at early (4 months) and late (10 months) phases of disease in the cardiomyopathic (CM) hamster, and the combination of GH with chronic ACE inhibition was assessed in late-phase heart failure.", 
    "221": "CM hamsters (CHF 147 line) at 4 months showed severe systolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with normal LV filling pressure, and at 10 months there was more severe systolic as well as diastolic dysfunction with increasing myocardial fibrosis. Recombinant human GH alone for 3 weeks at age 4 months increased LV wall thickness and reduced systolic wall stress without altering diastolic wall stress, whereas at 10 months, wall stress and fractional shortening did not improve. The LV dP/dt(max) was enhanced at both ages by GH, which at 4 months reflected increased contractility, but at 10 months was most likely caused by elevation of the LV filling pressure. The increasing degree of fibrosis correlated inversely with LV function but was unaffected by GH. In other CM hamsters, high-dose ACE inhibition alone (quinapril), started at 8 months and continued for 11 weeks, improved LV function and inhibited unfavorable remodeling, but the addition of GH for 3 weeks at age 10 months produced increased wall thickness with little additional functional benefit and increased the LV filling pressure and diastolic wall stress.", 
    "222": "GH treatment alone improved LV dysfunction at 4 months of age in CM hamsters by increasing contractility and reducing wall stress but had few beneficial effects at 10 months in severe LV failure. After chronic ACE inhibition, addition of GH at 10 months had no additional beneficial effects and further increased LV diastolic pressure. These differing effects of GH may relate to the progressive increase of LV fibrosis in the CM hamster.",

The odds ratios (95%-confidence intervals) for depression, adjusted for type of practice, number of visits and prescriptions, hospitalization, cardiovascular diagnoses, and renal failure, were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.2-4.2) for exposure to CCB 6 months prior to index date, 2.6 (95% CI: 1.1-7.0) for beta-blockers, and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.2) for ACE inhibitors, respectively.

In all, 3,991 patients in NYHA class II-IV who were stable on standard medical treatment, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis, were randomized to metoprolol CR/XL or placebo and uptitrated from 12.5 or 25 mg to 200 mg over an 8-week period and were planned to be followed for a period of 2 years. The study was stopped earlier than planned due to the significant benefit achieved with metoprolol CR/XL on all-cause mortality. Treatment with metoprolol CR/XL was associated with a 34% decrease in all-cause mortality, 38% decrease in cardiovascular mortality, 41% decrease in sudden death, and 49% decrease in death due to progressive heart failure. The average dose of metoprolol CR/XL at the end of the study was 159 mg, and 64% of the patients were receiving 200 mg of metoprolol CR/XL. There was no significant difference in the placebo and active treatment group with regard to permanent discontinuation. Treatment of patients in NYHA class II-IV with metoprolol CR/XL is associated with a significant decrease in total mortality.", 
    "233": "Recent investigations have indicated that chronic heart failure can be reversed with agents that inhibit the reninangiotensin-aldosterone or sympathetic nervous system, such as angiontensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers. A meta-analysis of clinical trials of ACE inhibition in chronic heart failure reported reductions in mortality ranging from 13 to 33%, but as ACE inhibitors do not block chronic noradrenergic stimulation of the heart, mortality remains unacceptably high. Beta blockers have been shown to increase left ventricular ejection fraction, reduce end-systolic and end-diastolic cardiac dimensions, improve quality of life, and reduce mortality. All-cause mortality in the US Carvedilol trial was reduced 65%, and in MERIT-HF there was a 49% reduction in mortality from heart failure among patients receiving metoprolol CR/XL. MERIT-HF was ended early because of evidence of survival benefit. Although certain effects of beta blockers may be considered class effects, it is not yet clear whether there are differences between beta 1-selective antagonists and nonselective agents. The benefits conferred across differences in disease severity, race, and age should be answered as large ongoing and planned clinical trials of beta blockers are completed.", 
    "234": "Enhanced and sustained cardiac adrenergic drive occurs in heart failure (HF) and contributes, in part, to the progression of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and remodeling that are characteristic of this disease state. Enhanced sympathetic drive in HF can lead to downregulation and desensitization of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors with a consequent impairment of myocardial reserve and exercise tolerance. This sympathoadrenergic maladaptation can also lead to cellular abnormalities in the failing heart, manifested by defects in calcium handling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, by defects in myocardial energetics, and by ongoing loss of cardiomyocytes through necrosis or apoptosis. Chronic treatment with beta blockers in patients with HF and in animals with experimentally induced HF has been shown to reverse, prevent, or, at the least, arrest many, if not all, of these adverse processes. Beta blockers improve function of the failing LV, prevent or reverse progressive LV dilation, chamber sphericity, and hypertrophy, and consequently have positive impact on cardiac remodeling. Beta blockers also reduce heart rate and LV wall stress, leading to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption, a clear benefit to the failing heart. Beta blockers can also improve the intrinsic contractile function of cardiomyocytes and have also been shown to improve myocardial energetics in HF, possibly through desirable changes in substrate utilization. Recent studies from our laboratories have also shown that beta blockers can attenuate cardiomyocyte apoptosis in HF. These benefits provide strong reinforcement to the clinical findings that beta blockers are highly beneficial for the management of patients with chronic HF and, when properly used, afford unequivocal reductions in mortality and morbidity in this patient population. At present, there is general agreement that increased cardiac sympathetic drive occurs in HF and may potentially be an important contributor to the progression of LV dysfunction and chamber remodeling that is characteristic of this disease state. Experimental studies in animal models of HF as well as clinical studies in patients with HF have suggested that chronic therapy with beta blockade is effective in preventing the progression of LV dysfunction and remodeling, the latter evidenced by reversal and/or prevention of progressive LV dilation and chamber sphericity. Results of recent multicenter clinical trials support these findings and have made it abundantly clear that long-term therapy with beta blockade inhibits clinical progression and has a major impact on mortality and morbidity in patients with HF that is at least as favorable, if not better, than that observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Beta blockers improve mortality and morbidity in HF and also improve LV ejection fraction (EF), a beneficial feature that, until recently, has only been attributed to positive inotropic agents.", 
    "235": "Beta blockers have been shown to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death in more than 50 randomized trials involving more than 55,000 patients. Relative reductions (vs. placebo) in cardiac death in some of these trials ranged from 30 to 50%. These reductions are substantially greater than trials of other drug classes including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. However, not all beta blockers confer equal benefit to patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. Results from various trials suggest that lipophilic beta blockers--such as timolol, metoprolol, propranolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol--may be more beneficial than hydrophilic beta blockers. Results of animal studies have indicated that sudden cardiac death is mediated, at least in part, by the central nervous system, which may account for why lipophilic agents have more pronounced clinical effects. Based on the results of numerous clinical and mechanistic studies, it is suggested that beta blockers should be given to all patients at risk for sudden cardiac death, including those patients with previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, or congestive heart failure.", 
    "236": "Most of the biological actions of the circulating (a.k.a., the systemic or blood-borne) renin-angiotensin system require the generation of the octapeptide angiotensin (ANG) II from the decapeptide ANG I. In the case of circulating ANG I, the lungs are generally considered the major site for this conversion. The present experiments explored the possibility that under conditions of marked elevations of blood-borne ANG I, the generation of ANG II takes place within brain-associated target tissues, most notably circumventricular organs (CVOs) that lack a blood-brain barrier. The first important result of these experiments demonstrates that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of the converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, completely blocks the drinking response and significantly attenuates the pressor response produced by systemically infused ANG I. This result indicates that under physiological/pathophysiological conditions associated with large elevations of circulating ANG I, an important part of the biological responses derived from blood-borne ANG may result from local conversion of ANG I to ANG II within specific brain target tissues which have high concentrations of converting enzyme. This local conversion process provides an important mechanism that would act to reinforce the \"classic\" conversion process which takes place in the lungs thereby delivering more ANG II immediately to central target receptors. The second important finding from these studies showed that drinking produced by systemically infused ANG II was not attenuated by an i.c.v. dose of captopril which was effective in blocking a comparable dipsogenic response induced by i.v. ANG I. This observation suggests that drinking induced by systemic ANG II does not require an intact metabolic cascade within the brain for the formation of ANG II (or ANG II-like effector peptide) from ANG I.",

    "244": "The progression of congestive heart failure (CHF) is left ventricular (LV) myocardial remodeling. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to tissue remodeling and therefore MMP inhibition may serve as a useful therapeutic target in CHF. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition favorably affects LV myocardial remodeling in CHF. This study examined the effects of specific MMP inhibition, ACE inhibition, and combined treatment on LV systolic and diastolic function in a model of CHF. Pigs were randomly assigned to five groups: 1) rapid atrial pacing (240 beats/min) for 3 weeks (n = 8); 2) ACE inhibition (fosinopril, 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. orally) and rapid pacing (n = 8); 3) MMP inhibition (PD166793 2 mg/kg/day p.o.) and rapid pacing (n = 8); 4) combined ACE and MMP inhibition (2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. and 2 mg/kg/day, respectively) and rapid pacing (n = 8); and 5) controls (n = 9). LV peak wall stress increased by 2-fold with rapid pacing and was reduced in all treatment groups. LV fractional shortening fell by nearly 2-fold with rapid pacing and increased in all treatment groups. The circumferential fiber shortening-systolic stress relation was reduced with rapid pacing and increased in the ACE inhibition and combination groups. LV myocardial stiffness constant was unchanged in the rapid pacing group, increased nearly 2-fold in the MMP inhibition group, and was normalized in the ACE inhibition and combination treatment groups. Increased MMP activation contributes to the LV dilation and increased wall stress with pacing CHF and a contributory downstream mechanism of ACE inhibition is an effect on MMP activity.",

The benefits of blood pressure and aldosterone suppression during captopril treatment were assessed. SHRsp developed a 100% mortality rate with intracerebral hemorrhage by 16 weeks of age. Captopril treatment, started 2 weeks before or at the initiation of stroke, suppressed plasma aldosterone and equally prevented mortality to a mean age of >27 weeks. Treatment started 5 days after stroke extended the mean lifespan to >23 weeks. The re-elevation of plasma aldosterone (via osmotic pumps to levels in untreated SHRsp) during captopril treatment, before stroke, allowed stroke to develop. The initiation of the latter manipulation in pre- or poststroke captopril-treated SHRsp at a latter age (23 weeks) didn't alter the lifespan of SHRsp (death occurred at about 28 weeks). The antistroke effects of captopril treatment occurred without an antihypertensive effect, weren't altered by enhancing hypertension during treatment (with dexamethasone), and couldn't be duplicated by antihypertensive treatment with hydralazine. Spironolactone treatment didn't duplicate the effects of captopril. The suppression of plasma aldosterone may retard the onset of stroke in SHRsp during captopril treatment but likely other factors prolong life in pre- and poststroke SHRsp receiving long-term captopril treatment. The observation that spironolactone treatment couldn't duplicate the effects of captopril suggests that aldosterone may facilitate stroke through nongenomic receptor mechanisms.",

Another sample (S fraction) from Ashitaba also had antihypertensive effects after a single intravenous administration to SHR. The sample was further purified by using several chromatographies. The ACE inhibitor fraction was characterized as follows: no significant absorbance, a zwitterion, a water-soluble substance and a positive ninhydrin reaction. According to a mass spectrum analysis, the molecular weight of the ACE inhibitor was determined to be 303 and Na-salt ions of carboxyl groups were detected.

    "250": "The natriuretic peptides are a group of structurally similar but genetically distinct peptides that have diverse actions in cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine homeostasis. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are of myocardial cell origin and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is of endothelial origin. ANP and BNP bind to the natriuretic peptide-A receptor (NPR-A), which, via 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), mediates natriuresis, vasodilation, renin inhibition, antimitogenesis, and lusitropic properties. CNP lacks natriuretic actions but possesses vasodilating and growth-inhibiting actions via the guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide-B receptor (NPR-B). All three peptides are cleared by the natriuretic peptide-C receptor (NPR-C) and are degraded by the ectoenzyme neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP), both of which are widely expressed in the kidneys, lungs, and the vascular wall. Congestive heart failure (CHF) represents a pathological state in which the activation of the natriuretic peptides exceeds those of all other states. In this brief review, we will attempt to provide an update on important issues regarding natriuretic peptides in CHF, with a focus on their functional importance as a beneficial humoral response in asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), the mechanisms of natriuretic peptide hyporesponsiveness in severe heart failure, the diagnostic and prognostic significance of the natriuretic peptides in CHF, and the therapeutic potential of the natriuretic peptides in this multiorgan syndrome.", 
    "251": "In the present study, we reassessed whether angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) can exert short- and long-term cardiovascular effects because there has been a resurgence of interest in this N-terminal heptapeptide fragment of Ang II. In particular, we studied 3 aspects relating to the reported cardiovascular effects of Ang-(1-7): does this peptide (1) potentiate the hypotensive effect of bradykinin in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), (2) cause a depressor effect after long-term treatment in SHR, and (3) contribute to the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors? In the first series of experiments, Ang-(1-7) failed to enhance the dose-related hypotensive responses evoked by bradykinin in SHR (n=11) and Wistar-Kyoto (n=5) rats. In the second series of experiments, a 7-day intravenous infusion of Ang-(1-7) (24 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) decreased blood pressure in SHR (n=12) on days 4 and 5, although this effect waned despite continual Ang-(1-7) infusion. However, a new finding was that the Ang-(1-7) antagonist A-779 (24 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 7 days) attenuated the depressor effect of Ang-(1-7) when given concurrently in a separate group of SHR (n=8). In the third series of novel experiments, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril was given in drinking water for 7 days (0.3 mg. kg(-1) x day(-1)), either alone (n=6) or combined with an intravenous infusion of A-779 (24 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 7 days, n=8). Although this dose of A-779 attenuated the depressor effect of Ang-(1-7), it did not alter the antihypertensive effect caused by perindopril. Thus, the present results contrast with a number of previous studies and argue against Ang-(1-7) playing a major role in blood pressure regulation.", 
    "252": "Magnesium (Mg) deficiency enhances tissue sensitivity to ischemic damage, an effect reversed not only by Mg, but also by sulfhydryl (SH)-containing compounds. We therefore created an in vitro model of red blood cell ischemia to investigate whether the protective effects of these compounds might be related to effects on intracellular free Mg (Mg(i)) content. (31)P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to measure the high-energy metabolites ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) and Mg(i) and inorganic phosphate (P(i)) levels in erythrocytes before and for 6 hours after progressive oxygen depletion in the presence or absence of SH-compounds, including captopril, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), penicillamine, and N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (MPG). Under basal aerobic conditions, captopril increased Mg(i) in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (174.5+/-5.3 to 217.1+/-5.1 micromol/L, P<0. 05 at 100 micromol/L, 60 minutes). The SH compounds NAC, penicillamine, and MPG but not the non-SH compound enalaprilat also significantly raised Mg(i) in erythrocytes (P<0.05). With oxygen deprivation, a consistent decrease occurred in both ATP and 2,3-DPG levels associated with a rise in P(i) and in the P(i)/2,3-DPG ratio used as an index of high-energy metabolite depletion. Captopril, compared with control, retarded the rise in P(i) and reduced the P(i)/2,3-DPG ratio (P<0.008 and P<0.025 at 4 and 6 hours, respectively). Furthermore, the higher the initial Mg(i) and the greater the captopril-induced rise in Mg(i), the greater the metabolite-protective effect (r=0.799 and r=0.823, respectively; P<0. 01 for both). Altogether, the data suggest that Mg influences the cellular response to ischemia and that the ability of SH compounds such as captopril to ameliorate ischemic injury may at least in part be attributable to the ability of such compounds to increase cytosolic free Mg levels.", 
    "253": "Hemodynamic factors, circulating hormones, paracrine factors, and intracrine factors influence vascular smooth muscle growth and plasticity. The well-characterized role of angiotensin II in the modulation of vascular tone and cell function may be critically involved in the mechanisms by which vascular smooth muscle responds to signals associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and increases in oxidative stress. Studies from this laboratory suggest that the trophic actions of angiotensin II may be intrinsically regulated by angiotensin-(1-7), a separate product of the angiotensin system derived from the common substrate, angiotensin I. Exposure of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells to angiotensin-(1-7) inhibited the trophic actions of angiotensin II and reduced the expression of the mitogenic effects of both normal serum and platelet-derived growth factor. The growth-inhibitory actions of angiotensin-(1-7) were blocked by the selective D-alanine(7)-angiotensin-(1-7) antagonist and the nonselective angiotensin receptor blocker sarcosine(1)-threonine(8)-angiotensin II. In contrast, subtype-selective antagonists for the AT(1) and AT(2) receptors had no effect on the inhibitory actions of angiotensin-(1-7), a finding that is consistent with the pharmacological characterization of a high-affinity (125)I-labeled angiotensin-(1-7) binding site in the vasculature by use of selective and nonselective angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The relevance of these findings to the proliferative response of vascular smooth muscle cells after endothelial injury was confirmed by assessment of the effect of a 12-day infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) on neointimal formation. In these experiments, the proliferative response produced by injuring the carotid artery was inhibited by angiotensin-(1-7) through a mechanism that could not be explained by changes in arterial pressure. Because plasma angiotensin-(1-7) increased to levels comparable to those found in animals and human subjects given therapeutic doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-(1-7) may be one factor participating in the reversal of vascular proliferation during inhibition of angiotensin II formation or activity.", 
    "254": "Mibefradil and amlodipine are calcium antagonists with different channel selectivities. Mibefradil blocks both L- and T-type calcium channels; although in the usual pharmacological doses, it predominantly blocks the T-type channels. In contrast, amlodipine selectively blocks L-type channels. The goal of the present study was to assess whether this differential selectivity would result in different effects on end-organ damage in experimental hypertension. For this purpose, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats were treated either with equipotent doses of mibefradil or amlodipine (30 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) as food admix). Despite the fact that both drugs decreased systolic arterial pressure to the same extent (140+/-5 mm Hg in the mibefradil group and 144+/-3 mm Hg in the amlodipine group versus 225+/-5 mm Hg in the untreated-DOCA group), only mibefradil decreased proteinuria (35. 5+/-6.5 versus 103.3+/-14.1 mg/24 h in untreated DOCA-salt animals) and prevented glomerular lesions. Both drugs, however, prevented the occurrence of vascular renal lesions. To elucidate the mechanism responsible for this difference, we evaluated in an additional series of experiments the effects of mibefradil and amlodipine on plasma and renal renin concentrations, as well as the effects of the addition of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, given on top of both drugs on proteinuria. Amlodipine, in contrast to mibefradil, markedly stimulated the plasma (17.8+/-2.6 ng Ang I. mL(-1). h(-1) in the amlodipine group versus 3.9+/-0.4 ng Ang I. mL(-1). h(-1) in the mibefradil group and 3.2+/-0.3 ng Ang I. mL(-1). h(-1) in the untreated-DOCA group) and renal (2.42+/-0.37 ng Ang I. mL(-1). h(-1) in the amlodipine group versus 0.36+/-0.04 ng Ang I. mL(-1). h(-1) in the mibefradil group and 0.26+/-0.08 ng Ang I. mL(-1). h(-1) in the untreated-DOCA group) renin concentrations. Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system could explain the absence of a renal protective effect of amlodipine. This was also suggested by the fact that enalapril given in addition to amlodipine could decrease proteinuria. In conclusion, T-type channel blockade by mibefradil decreases blood pressure without stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system and therefore prevents most of the glomerular damage in DOCA hypertensive rats.", 
    "255": "The aim of this study was to determine whether bradykinin, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat, and the calcium-channel antagonist amlodipine reduce myocardial oxygen consumption (MV(O2)) via a B(2)-kinin receptor/nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. Left ventricular free wall and septum were isolated from normal and B(2)-kinin receptor knockout (B(2) -/-) mice. Myocardial tissue oxygen consumption was measured in an airtight chamber with a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Baseline MV(O2) was not significantly different between normal (239+/-13 nmol of O(2). min(-1). g(-1)) and B(2) -/- (263+/-24 nmol of O(2). min(-1). g(-1)) mice. S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L) reduced oxygen consumption in a concentration-dependent manner in both normal (maximum, 36+/-3%) and B(2) -/- mice (28+/-3%). This was also true for the endothelium-dependent vasodilator substance P (10(-10) to 10(-7) mol/L; 22+/-7% in normal mice and 20+/-4% in B(2) -/- mice). Bradykinin (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L), ramiprilat (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L), and amlodipine (10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/L) all caused concentration-dependent decreases in MV(O2)in normal mice. At the highest concentration, tissue O(2) consumption was decreased by 18+/-3%, 20+/-5%, and 28+/-3%, respectively. The reduction in MV(O2) to all 3 drugs was attenuated in the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester. However, in the B(2) -/- mice, bradykinin, ramiprilat, and amlodipine had virtually no effect on MV(O2). Therefore, nitric oxide, through a bradykinin-receptor-dependent mechanism, regulates cardiac oxygen consumption. This physiological mechanism is absent in B(2) -/- mice and may be evidence of an important therapeutic mechanism of action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and amlodipine.", 
    "256": "Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) activates vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and causes oxidative stress.

Studies involved aortas of rats receiving no treatment, L-NAME, L-NAME plus L-arginine, or L-NAME plus an antioxidant drug (N-acetylcysteine, allopurinol, or ebselen) for 7 days. L-NAME significantly increased oxidative stress (O(2)(-)) and ACE activity. The increased O(2)(-) production was normalized by removal of endothelium. Immunohistochemistry showed the increased ACE activity in the endothelial layer. Treatment with antioxidant drugs did not affect the L-NAME-induced increase in systolic arterial pressure but did prevent increases in vascular O(2)(-) production and ACE activity. These results implicate oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of vascular ACE activation in rats with long-term inhibition of NO synthesis. The observed effects of antioxidant drugs on ACE activation do not appear to involve the hypertension induced by L-NAME.",

In the enalapril group, ACE activity (IU/liter) (14.0 before, 5.2 on day 3, 5.8 on day 7, 6.3 on day 28), TF levels (pg/ml) (223, 203, 182, 178) and MCP-1 levels (pg/ml) (919, 789, 790, 803) significantly decreased by day 28. However, the free TFPI levels (ng/ml) (28.2, 26.5, 26.8, 28.4) did not change. These four variables were unchanged during the study period in the placebo group.",

    "278": "Heart failure is a lethal, end-stage cardiovascular disease. Recent decrease in mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases has not been accompanied by a reduced mortality from heart failure. Survival, once the heart has used up all its reserves and compensatory mechanisms, is a little better than in cancer. That makes heart failure one of the most important world health problems.", 
    "279": "This paper briefly reviews history, present and future of heart failure therapy, as a worldwide problem. Definition and diagnosis of heart failure, mechanism of deterioration of heart function, clinical use of present drugs in heart failure therapy and need for prevention of heart failure are, briefly pointed out. Results of clinical studies are presented, as well as the recommended indication for drug use. Heart failure is not readily identified, defined and evaluated. There is an absence of clear definition. To find a new definition which complies best with clinical practice is an important challenge cardiologists must face. Heart failure is a progressive disease and once the process has started it continues with further deterioration of cardiac function or ends in sudden death. In many patients changes within heart develop long before clinical symptoms occur. The left ventricle goes through a number of adaptations remodeling to compensate increased pressure or volume load or subsequent myocardial infarction.", 
    "280": "For decades therapy has been focused on relieving symptoms, whereas preventive aspects and prolonging survival received less attention. Conventional therapy with diuretics and cardiotonic glycosides causes regression of symptoms and signs of heart failure, but there is no evidence that these drugs slow down the progression of the disease and reduce mortality. Currently, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors plus diuretics are considered first line therapy for all degrees of heart failure, except for heart failure with atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular rate. They are, currently, the only agents with proven ability to decrease mortality. There is evidence about the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It is likely that not only patients with significant reduction of systolic function but also other signs of impaired left ventricular dysfunction will benefit from treatment with ACE inhibitors. However, only preventive treatment may decrease the number of patients with new onset of clinical heart failure. Therefore treatment should be introduced early, rather than waiting for heart failure to progress to a more severe stage. Based on these facts ACE inhibitors should be considered as treatment of choice, a first line therapy in most cases of heart failure. A substantial reduction in cardiovascular mortality requires detection and correction of presymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and risk factors, which predispose to its occurrence. Major contributors to the development of cardiac failure have been delineated and quantified. Identification of high-risk individuals is difficult since signs and symptoms of heart failure are often lacking. A strategy to find these patients must use objective methods to characterize the state of the left ventricle. Despite this, methods for efficient identification presymptomatic candidates for cardiac failure for preventive measures have been developed. High-risk candidates can now be costly-effectively targeted for treatment to delay failure. Early diagnosis and subsequent aggressive medical or surgical treatment are therefore fundamental to improve adverse outcome of heart failure. It is necessary to allow a rational approach to the clinician, indicating the effectiveness of these drugs in patients with evidence of impaired ventricular function.",

    "282": "Cardiac after-load, neurohumoral reaction and the secondary cardiac hypertrophy were studied in six groups of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with abdominal aortic constriction. We found that abdominal aortic constriction above the renal arteries decreased the heart rate and cardiac output, and increased the pulse pressure. These abnormalities would return to normal after constriction ended. Captopril, propranolol and prazosin could reduce the increase of pulse pressure but still had decreased in cardiac output of rats with abdominal constriction. Aortic constriction also increased the aortic impedance and cardiac load but decreased aortic compliance. These changes could also be lessened by captopril, propranolol and prazosin. We have confirmed that aortic constriction can induce secondary cardiac hypertrophy, but the pathogenesis might be due to multiple factors.", 
    "283": "This brief review discusses the problem of atherosclerotic renal artery obstruction in the elderly. This disorder is common in the elderly; the overall incidence is estimated to be 10%. The disorder presents with new onset hypertension, a loss of control of BP or a decline in renal function in some patients. In others, the obstruction may be unmasked by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker agents. The current approach to the diagnosis of renal artery obstruction is discussed as are the indications for invasive procedures. Careful patient selection for any invasive procedures is particularly important in the elderly since this population has a propensity to higher morbidity.", 
    "284": "Captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline) is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, used widely in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Captopril also inhibits proliferation of a variety of cell types, including several lacking ACE and renin acitvity. We have previously demonstrated that human mammary ductal carcinoma cells are among the cell types whose mitotic activity is inhibited by captopril. In those cells, captopril also reduces estrogen receptor (ER) and increases progesterone receptor (PR) concentrations. The present study evaluated the mechanism of captopril's antiproliferative action in an ER/PR-negative human mammary ductal carcinoma cell line, Hs578T. Cells grown in a 10% serum medium showed negligible changes in the presence of captopril alone. However, in the presence of subphysiologic concentrations of copper salts or copper-loaded ceruloplasmin, captopril caused a dose-dependent reduction in cell number, thymidine incorporation and mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity. In contrast, iron salts and iron-saturated transferrin had no effect on captopril activity. Catalase and horseradish peroxidase nullified the cytotoxic effects of captopril/Cu++, whereas H2O2 mimicked those effects. These data are consistent with the notion of a copper-catalyzed oxidation of captopril, leading to the generation of H2O2 as the cytotoxin to this clinically important cell type.", 
    "285": "The aim of this study was to investigate if the angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan in antihypertensive plasma concentrations improves myocardial function and limits infarct size in anesthetized pigs. Animals were subjected to 45 min of regional ischemia and 240 min of reperfusion. Starting 60 min before ischemia, two groups of pigs (n = 6 in each) received either candesartan (25 micrograms/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 14 micrograms/kg/h) or the corresponding volume of vehicle throughout the study period. Left ventricular systolic segment shortening (%SS) was measured by sonomicrometry, and infarct size was determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. The plasma concentration of candesartan during the experiment was between 100 and 150 nmol/L, which was considered to be within the therapeutic range. Neither candesartan nor vehicle affected hemodynamics or coronary blood flow prior to ischemia. Compared to vehicle, candesartan improved recovery of %SS in the ischemic area. At 240 min of reperfusion, the %SS was significantly higher in pigs given candesartan than in pigs given vehicle (7.1 +/- 0.87% vs-1 +/- 1.79%; p < 0.01). In both groups the area at risk was approximately 20% of the left ventricle. Infarct size as a percentage of the area at risk was significantly smaller in the candesartan group than in the vehicle group (46 +/- 3.0 vs 73 +/- 3.6%; p < 0.01). The results suggest that angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockade, obtained in antihypertensive plasma concentrations, supports myocardial functional recovery and limits infarct size.", 
    "286": "To assess the effect of antihypertensive drugs on aortic distensibility, we evaluated the aortic distensibility of 33 hypertensive patients before and after antihypertensive treatment by using cine magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty three hypertensive patients were divided into three groups and treated for 12 weeks with 2-4 mg trichlormethiazide per day (n = 10), 80 mg nicardipine per day (n = 13) and 50 mg alacepril per day (n = 10). There were no significant differences in mean age and mean blood pressure among the three groups. Cine magnetic resonance was performed at ascending and descending aortic levels. Aortic area was measured at the maximum and minimum frames. The effect of antihypertensive therapy on aortic distensibility was evaluated as the percent change from before treatment to after treatment. There were no significant differences in pulse pressure before and after treatment with trichlormethiazide, nicardipine and alacepril. After treatment with these drugs, mean blood pressure in all groups decreased (trichlormethiazide and nicardipine, P < .01; alacepril, P < .05), (the maximum area--the minimum area) and aortic distensibility in all groups increased significantly (each P < .01). Percent changes in aortic distensibility after treatment were significantly higher with nicardipine (ascending, 346.6 +/- 255.9%; descending, 338.8 +/- 246.5%, each P < .05) and alacepril (ascending, 369.7 +/- 238.8%, P < .05; descending, 306.9 +/- 123.3%, P < .01) than with trichlormethiazide (ascending, 146.0 +/- 139.6%; descending, 129.3 +/- 97.5%). In conclusion, nicardipine and alacepril have a beneficial effect on aortic distensibility.",

In each case serum potassium returned to the normal range after cessation of the salt substitute.

    "288": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability profiles of the selective AT1 receptor antagonists telmisartan and losartan were compared with placebo in a 6-week, multinational, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study of 223 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, defined as clinic diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >/=95 and </=114 mm Hg, clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) >/=140 and </=200 mm Hg, and 24-h ambulatory DBP >/=85 mm Hg. After a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in, eligible patients were randomised to receive telmisartan 40 mg, telmisartan 80 mg, losartan 50 mg, or placebo. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) after 6 weeks of double-blind therapy showed that all active treatments produced significant (P < 0.01) reductions from baseline in 24-h mean SBP and DBP compared with placebo. During the 18-to-24 h period after dosing, the reductions in SBP/DBP with telmisartan 40 mg (10.7/6.8 mm Hg) and 80 mg (12.2/7. 1 mm Hg) were each significantly (P <0.05) greater than those observed for losartan 50 mg (6.0/3.7 mm Hg), and losartan was no better than placebo. Also for the 24-h mean blood pressure, telmisartan 40 mg and 80 mg were significantly (P< 0.05) better than losartan 50 mg. Compared with losartan, telmisartan 80 mg produced significantly (P < 0.05) greater reductions in both SBP and DBP during all monitored periods of the 24-h period, while telmisartan 40 mg produced significantly greater reductions in SBP and DBP in the night-time period (10.01 pm to 5.59 am) (P < 0.05) and in DBP in the morning period (6.00 am to 11.59 am) (P < 0.05). All treatments were comparably well tolerated. Telmisartan 40 mg and 80 mg once daily were effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension, producing sustained 24-h blood pressure control which compared favourably with losartan.",

We investigated the relationship between angiotensin II formation and the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed a high-cholesterol (4% cholesterol and 6% corn oil) diet for 6 months, and studied the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril (10 mg kg-1 per day, p.o.), and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, 2-butyl-4-(methylthio)-1-[[2'[[[(propylamino)carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl] (1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl]methyl]-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate (HR 720; 20 mg kg-1 per day, p.o.). 2. The level of low-density lipoprotein was significantly increased by the cholesterol diet, whereas that of high-density lipoprotein was significantly decreased. The relative areas of the atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta in the normal and cholesterol-diet groups were 1.3+/-0.3 and 64+/-10%, respectively. 3. Plasma renin and ACE activities showed no differences between the normal and cholesterol-diet groups. ACE activity and the concentration of angiotensin II were significantly increased in the aorta of the cholesterol-fed monkeys. 4. Trandolapril and HR 720 decreased significantly the area of the atherosclerotic lesions in the thoracic aorta of cholesterol-fed monkeys, but not the mean blood pressure and the levels of low-density and high-density lipoproteins. 5. In plasma and aorta, trandolapril, but not HR 720, decreased significantly the ACE activities in the cholesterol-fed monkeys, while both of these drugs decreased significantly the angiotensin II levels. 6. In conclusion, blockade of angiotensin II function in vascular tissues by trandolapril or HR 720 may play an important role in preventing the development of atherosclerotic lesions.", 
    "290": "HIV-associated nephropathy is manifested by heavy proteinuria and renal insufficiency and characterized pathologically by the collapsing variant of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis with acute tubular necrosis and mild interstitial inflammation. Untreated, it may result in end-stage renal disease in as little as 4 months. It may present in patients with any manifestation of HIV infection, and affects predominantly black individuals. Insights into pathogenesis have come from a transgenic mouse model, renal cell cultures, and from study of human biopsy material. Although the pathogenesis is not completely understood, current considerations revolve around the role of HIV or protein in renal epithelium and the effects of cytokines, including transforming growth factor-beta and basic fibroblast growth factor, on renal structures. Therapy with zidovudine, corticosteroids, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has met with modest success; to date, protease inhibitors have not been assessed.", 
    "291": "The Losartan Heart Failure ELITE Study recently found that in patients with symptomatic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of </=0.40, losartan compared to captopril improved survival with better tolerability. The objective of this study was to perform an economic evaluation of losartan versus captopril based on the results of the Losartan Heart Failure ELITE Study. The Losartan Heart Failure ELITE Study was a multinational, double-blind, randomized 48-week study comparing the safety and efficacy of losartan to captopril in angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor-naive patients >/=65 years with symptomatic heart failure. Data on health care resource utilization were collected as part of the trial. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate the lifetime benefits of treatment and the associated costs. We observed no differences between treatments in the number of hospitalizations, hospital days, and emergency room visits per patient over the trial period. We estimated the total cost of losartan to be USD 54 (95% CI: USD -1,717, USD 1,755) less per patient than captopril over this time frame. We also estimated that over the projected remaining lifetime of the study population, losartan compared to captopril would increase survival by 0.20 years (undiscounted) at an average cost of USD 769 (discounted) more per patient. This cost increase translated into a cost-effectiveness ratio of USD 4,047 per year of life gained for losartan relative to captopril. In patients with symptomatic heart failure, losartan compared to captopril increased survival with better tolerability at a cost well within the range accepted as cost-effective.", 
    "292": "Experimental data consistently indicate that renal disease progression is fully prevented in proteinuric glomerulopathies by long-enough angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition therapy. Whether regression of established proteinuria to normal can be achieved is, however, ill defined. The current study was designed with the aim to clarify whether ACE inhibition may induce regression of established proteinuria and renal structural damage in MWF rats, a genetic model of progressive proteinuria and renal injury. Animals treated with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril from 20 weeks of age (time when proteinuria is already important) and age-matched untreated rats were followed for 10 weeks. ACE inhibition normalized systolic blood pressure and progressively reduced proteinuria (from 172 +/- 79 to 81 +/- 23 mg/24 hours). In these animals, a highly significant correlation was obtained between baseline proteinuria and antiproteinuric response. At variance in untreated rats, proteinuria showed a marked increase in the 10-week follow-up period (from 165 +/- 57 to 325 +/- 86 mg/24 hours). Lisinopril prevented the progression of renal damage, as documented by a significantly lower incidence of glomeruli affected by sclerotic lesions (P < 0.01) than in untreated animals after the 10-week study period. Kidney tissue damage was comparable in lisinopril-treated rats and in untreated animals at 20 weeks of age, indicating that structural changes were arrested by the treatment. Thus, in proteinuric MWF rats, late-onset ACE inhibition normalized blood pressure, effectively and progressively restored high protein excretion rate toward normal values, and arrested progression of tissue damage.", 
    "293": "In the kidney, renin gene expression is exquisitely localized to the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells lining the afferent arteriole, having the capacity to regulate renin synthesis in response to a variety of physiological cues. We investigated human renin gene expression in transgenic mice containing a genomic construct driven by 149 bp of its proximal promoter to elucidate whether this was sufficient to confer JG-specific expression. Whereas human renin mRNA was permissively expressed in most tissues, the transgene was expressed mainly in JG cells in the kidney. Active human renin and human prorenin were found in the systemic circulation at levels consistent with previous transgenic models. Remarkably, two lines displayed an appropriate upregulation of transgene mRNA in response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and two lines exhibited a downregulation of transgene mRNA in response to subpressor and pressor doses of ANG II. Our results suggest that 149 bp of the human renin proximal promoter, in a context of a genomic construct, are sufficient to confer human renin expression in renal JG cells and at least some aspects of appropriate regulation.", 
    "294": "The renin-angiotensin system is critically important to fetal cardiovascular function and organ development. The feedback regulation of renin secretion by ANG II develops early in gestation yet does not linearly progress from fetal life to adulthood. Renin secretion is elevated in late gestation compared with earlier or postnatal time periods, which suggests that some component of the negative feedback regulation of renin secretion is less sensitive in late gestation. We examined in fetal sheep the age-related consequence of chronic in vivo manipulation of ANG II on renal renin secretion measured in vitro. Immature (101-103 days of gestation) and mature (130-133 days of gestation) fetuses were treated for 72 h with enalaprilat, ANG II or vehicle. Content and basal and isoproterenol-stimulated secretion of prorenin (PR) and active renin (AR) from fetal kidney cortical slices were determined. Enalaprilat pretreatment in vivo increased renal renin content and basal and stimulated secretion of PR and AR in vitro even in immature animals. Immunohistochemical localization showed that enalaprilat treatment caused an age-related recruitment of renin-containing juxtaglomerular cells. Conversely, ANG II pretreatment decreased basal and stimulated PR and AR secretion from immature fetal kidneys, but only inhibited PR secretion from mature kidneys. It also caused an age-related decrease in the percentage of renin-containing juxtaglomerular cells. These results suggest that ANG II feedback modulates not only the synthesis and content of renin, but the sensitivity of the coupling between stimulus and secretion. A critical observation of our study is that the higher renal tissue concentrations of prorenin and active renin in late gestation may be a consequence of reduced sensitivity to ANG II feedback; this is consistent with the increased plasma concentrations of renin found in near-term mammals.", 
    "295": "A main vector of the effects of stress is secretion of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), and adrenal steroids. Systemic administration of ACTH (2.8 microgram/day sc) for 7 days in BALB/c mice caused a very large increase of voluntary intake of 0.3 M NaCl equivalent to turnover of total body sodium content each day. Intracerebroventricular infusion of ACTH (20 ng/day) had no effect. Intracerebroventricular infusion of ovine CRF (10 ng/h for 7 days) caused an increase of sodium intake. The large sodium appetite-stimulating effect of systemic ACTH was not influenced by concurrent systemic infusion of captopril (2 mg/day). Induction of stress by immobilization of mice on a running wheel caused an increase in Na appetite associated with a 50% decrease of thymus weight, indicative of corticosteroid effects. The present data suggest that stress and the hormone cascade initiated by stress evoke a large sodium appetite in mice, which may be an important survival mechanism in environmental conditions causing stress.", 
    "296": "Cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal dysfunction plays an important role in the downregulation of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors in heart failure. To determine whether chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition improved cardiac sympathetic nerve terminal function and hence increased myocardial beta-adrenergic responsiveness, we administered ACE inhibitors to dogs with chronic right-sided heart failure (RHF) produced by tricuspid avulsion and pulmonary artery constriction. The RHF animals exhibited fluid retention, elevated right heart filling pressures, blunted inotropic response to isoproterenol, and reduced beta-adrenoceptor density. These changes were accompanied by decreases in right ventricular norepinephrine (NE) uptake and neuronal NE histofluorescence and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive profiles. ACE inhibitors had no effect on the production of heart failure but greatly reduced the attenuation of cardiac NE uptake, neuronal NE histofluorescence, and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive profiles. ACE inhibition also improved the inotropic response to isoproterenol and restored myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density. The changes probably are caused by reduction of cardiac NE release by ACE inhibition and may contribute to the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "297": "The effect of beta-blockade on left ventricular (LV) remodeling, when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) after anterior myocardial infarction (MI), is incompletely understood. On day 2 after coronary ligation-induced anteroapical infarction, 17 sheep were randomized to ramipril (ACEI, n = 8) or ramipril and metoprolol (ACEI-beta, n = 9). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and 8 wk after MI to measure changes in LV end-diastolic, end-systolic, and stroke volume indexes, LV mass index, ejection fraction (EF), and regional percent intramyocardial circumferential shortening. (123)I-labeled m-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and fluorescent microspheres before and after adenosine were infused before death at 8 wk post-MI for quantitation of sympathetic innervation, blood flow, and blood flow reserve in adjacent and remote noninfarcted regions. Infarct size, regional blood flow, blood flow reserve, and the increase in LV mass and LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes were similar between groups. However, EF fell less over the 8-wk study period in the ACEI-beta group (-13 +/- 11 vs. -22 +/- 4% in ACEI, P < 0.05). The ratio of adjacent to remote region (123)I-MIBG uptake was greater in ACEI-beta animals than in the ACEI group (0.93 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.07, P < 0.04). When added to ACE inhibition after transmural anteroapical MI, beta-blockade improves EF and adjacent regional sympathetic innervation but does not alter LV size.", 
    "298": "S-nitrosocaptopril (CapNO) has been proposed as a compound possessing capacities of both a nitric oxide (NO) donor and an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). In the present study, we characterized the physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacological properties of the crystalline CapNO. The novel stable crystals are in a red flake form. Spectroscopic analyses of CapNO revealed its UV/visible lambda(max) and the corresponding extinction coefficients, and characteristic infrared frequencies for the N=O and S-N stretch. The NMR signals corresponding to the protons attached to the carbon (C-S) and the carbon itself were remarkably shifted downfield upon S-nitrosylation. Mass and HPLC analyses, solubility, and melting point of CapNO were determined. Simultaneous on-line analyses of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of CapNO in catheterized awake rats of spontaneous hypertension (SHR) showed acute decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP), concomitant with the corresponding increases in plasma levels of CapNO after po or iv administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters for CapNO, i.e., t(1/2), T(max), C(max), V(d), AUC, and oral bioavailability were analyzed to understand the dose-dependent potency and effective period of CapNO. The highest concentrations of oral CapNO distributed in tissues were found in kidney, liver, lung, and small intestine. CapNO was excreted predominantly via urine, and second via feces in the detectable forms of thiols and nitrogen oxide although a small portion of CapNO was found in bile. The results provide the evidence of in vivo cleavage of the S-N bond and biotransformation of CapNO.", 
    "299": "It has been well demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can retard the progression of renal failure and kidney sclerosis in patients and animal models with glomerular diseases. The aim of this study was to observe the influences of ACEI on intrarenal Ang II and TGFbeta1 local formation and their relation to renal protective effects. Experimental glomerulosclerosis with nephrotic syndrome was induced in unilateral nephrectomized rats with repeated injections of adriamycin. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: 1) a sham-operated control group (n=8); 2) an NS group treated with ACEI (benazepril 4 mg/kg/d) (n=10), and 3) an NS group not treated (n=10). After 8 wk, serum, urine and renal tissue were collected for study. ACE activity and Ang II concentration in renal tissue were measured by colorimetry and radioimmunoassay, respectively. Immunohistochemistry staining was employed for transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) and extracellular matrix (ECM) examination. TGFbeta1 mRNA was assessed by in situ hybridization. Compared with those of non-treated nephropathy rats, ACE activity (13.39+/-5.02 vs. 49.13+/-12.92 U/ml, p< 0.01) and Ang II (402.61+/-80.22 vs. 751.63+/-137.45 pg/mg/pr p < 0.01) in renal tissue were significantly inhibited in the rats treated with ACEI. At the same time, proteinuria was significantly reduced (155.06+/-103.56 vs. 421.11+/-148.45 mg/24 h, p < 0.01) and renal function improved (Scr 76.3+/-33.1 vs. 107.1+/-71.0, p < 0.05), concomitant with a reduction in the glomerular sclerosis index (30.6+/-19.5 vs. 120.3+/-61.9, p < 0.01) and a reduction in ECM accumulation such as Col IV, III, LN and FN (29.2+/-9.8 vs. 76.8+/-12.4; 29.5+/-12.4 vs. 85.9+/-11.5; 26.0+/-5.1 vs. 69.6+/-1.73; 32.4+/-12.4 vs. 70.5+/-13.5; p< 0.01 in all cases). In the ACEI treated group, these histologic benefits coincided with a reduced expression of TGFbeta1 in both tubular cells and sclerosed glomeruli in protein as well as mRNA level. These findings provide further evidence that ACEI (benazepril) can prevent the progression of renal damage in both the function and morphologic changes which associated with a down-regulation of intrarenal Ang II level through the relative inhibition of renal ACE activity. The blocking of the intrarenal renin angiotensin system (RAS) might contribute to the inhibition of TGFbeta1 local formation and the TGFbeta1-mediated ECM accumulation that are related to the renal protective effects of ACEI.", 
    "300": "To compare the incidence of cough between two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, imidapril and enalapril, comparative crossover study was performed in 489 patients (228 men and 261 females) with essential or renal parenchymal hypertension. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, a group receiving imidapril for 12 wk (Period I) followed by enalapril for 12 wk (Period II), and a group in which the order of drugs was reversed. The occurrence of cough during treatment was monitored by questionnaire in all cases. There were no differences in background characteristics between the two groups. The incidence of cough during Period I was 15.2% (32/210) in the group initially treated with imidapril (Group IE) and 38.6% (85/220) in the group initially treated with enalapril (Group EI), the difference being statistically significant (p < 0.001). During Period I, decrease in blood pressure was observed in 63.9% (115/180) of Group IE and 64.6% (115/178) of Group EI patients. In approximately half of the patients in Group EI who developed cough during Period I and in whom the treatment was subsequently switched to imidapril, cough subsequently disappeared. It was concluded that the incidence of cough was significantly less under imidapril than under enalapril treatment, while there was no difference in the antihypertensive effects of the two ACE inhibitors.",

The same modification was performed on the potent bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist HOE 140 (H-D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-Tic-Oic-Arg-OH), in which the -D-Tic-Oic- moiety was replaced by D-BT to yield H-D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-BT-Arg-OH, 1 (JMV1116). These compounds were examined in vitro for their binding affinity toward bradykinin B(1) and B(2) receptors as well as for their ability to interfere with bradykinin-induced contraction of both human umbilical vein and rat uterus. The two compounds 3 and 1 competed with [(3)H]bradykinin binding to the human cloned B(2) receptor giving K(i) values of 13 +/- 2 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 nM, respectively. Unexpectedly, both compounds were full bradykinin B(2) receptor agonists on the human umbilical vein (pD(2) = 6.60 +/- 0.07 for 3 and 6.80 +/- 0.08 for 1) and rat uterus (pD(2) = 7.20 +/- 0.09 for 3 and 7.50 +/- 0.09 for 1) preparations with the same efficacy as bradykinin.

Blood pressure was recorded uninterruptedly with a battery-operated transmitter connected to a sensor catheter. Perindopril (3 mg/kg), trandolapril (1 mg/kg), quinapril (10 mg/kg) and enalapril (6 mg/kg) were given once a day for 7 days. On the first day of the treatment these ACE inhibitors equally decreased blood pressure by 20 mmHg at each peak. The peak and trough blood pressure decreased steadily until day 4, and then they were constant until the end of experiment (day 7). T/P for each inhibitor also increased until day 4, and the ratios in systolic blood pressure at the end of experiments (day 7) were as follows, perindopril: 0.63, trandolapril: 0.62, quinapril: 0.41, enalapril: 0.27. The T/P of perindopril was significantly higher than that of enalapril. The results of the present studies testing four ACE inhibitors are well consistent with those in clinical trials.

Cardiac function recovery was assessed after ischemia/reperfusion in the isolated working heart model. Rat hearts in the high-dose group were also reperfused with a solution containing nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor. Oral pretreatment of delapril did not affect baseline cardiac function. The percentage of cardiac output recovery for controls was 22 +/- 4.5%, for the low-dose group 44 +/- 6.5% (P < 0.05 versus controls), and for the high-dose group 76 +/- 5.3% (P < 0.001 versus controls and low-dose). Although coronary vascular resistance at the end of reperfusion showed no difference, mean coronary vascular resistance early after reperfusion was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in both delapril groups than in control. In the high-dose group, reperfusion with L-NAME significantly increased coronary vascular resistance after ischemia/reperfusion and attenuated the cardioprotectiveness of delapril (P < 0.05 versus without nitro-L-arginine methyl ester). We thus found that oral administration of delapril was cardioprotective dose-dependently against ischemia/reperfusion injury.

    "331": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilat, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on DNA synthesis and expression of ACE mRNA were examined in human vascular smooth muscle cells cultured from saphenous vein and internal mammary artery. DNA synthesis was estimated using 3H-thymidine uptake, and ACE mRNA was estimated by rt-PCR. Enalaprilat (0.125 microg/ml, 48 h) decreased 3H-thymidine uptake to 66+/-12% (SE) of the control without enalaprilat (p < 0.05). Basic FGF (10 ng/ml, 24 h) increased uptake by 41 +/- 12% (p < 0.05) while enalaprilat pretreatment (24 h) decreased uptake to 56 +/- 12% of this augmented value (p < 0.025). Basic FGF increased ACE mRNA, a process that was time dependent with an approximately 50% increase after 24 h exposure. Pre-exposure to enalaprilat (24 h) before bFGF reduced ACE mRNA to approximately 50% of that found in the presence of bFGF alone. The results indicate that ACE mRNA is present in human vascular smooth muscle cells and that exposure to an ACE inhibitor reduces DNA synthesis. Basic FGF stimulates DNA synthesis and ACE mRNA expression, and both of these effects are reduced by an ACE inhibitor. The results are consistent with the effects of bFGF being exerted through, or alternatively in concert with, angiotensin II. Further, they suggest that ACE inhibition can reduce the activity of the renin-angiotensin system by inhibiting the production of ACE, or at least the expression of ACE mRNA, in addition to producing enzyme inhibition at the ACE level.",

The efficacy of captopril in attenuating the hypertensive response to splenectomy was investigated in 82 thalassemic children. The control group, consisting of 40 patients, received intravenous furosemide (1 mg/kg) preoperatively; whereas, 42 children were randomly allocated into 2 groups to receive oral captopril (0.7 mg/kg) or a combination of captopril (0.7 mg/kg) and furosemide (1 mg/kg) before the operation. Before anesthetic induction, both systolic and diastolic arterial pressures in the captopril and the combined groups were significantly lower than the furosemide group (P < 0.001), whereas, the heart rates in all groups were comparable. Changes in arterial pressure in response to the operation were significantly smaller in the combined group when compared with the other two groups (P < 0.001). Immediate postoperative hypertension requiring additional management occurred in 20 per cent of the furosemide group, and 14.3 per cent in the other two groups. One patient in the combined group had a convulsion in association with hypertension. The authors conclude that captopril combined with furosemide effectively controls intraoperative hypertension in thalassemic children undergoing splenectomy; however, postoperative hypertension remains common, and needs appropriate treatment immediately.",

    "334": "Aminopeptidase P and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are responsible for the metabolism of exogenously administered bradykinin in the coronary circulation of the rat. It has been shown that ACE inhibitors decrease cytosolic enzyme release from the ischemic rat heart and reduce reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias by increasing endogenous levels of bradykinin. It was hypothesized that the aminopeptidase P inhibitor apstatin could do the same. In an isolated perfused rat heart preparation subjected to global ischemia and reperfusion, both apstatin and ramiprilat (an ACE inhibitor) significantly decreased creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The difference between the postischemia and preischemia levels of released CK was reduced 68% by apstatin and 68% by ramiprilat compared with control. The corresponding reductions in LDH release were 74% for apstatin and 81% for ramiprilat. A combination of the inhibitors was not significantly better than either one alone. Apstatin and ramiprilat also significantly reduced the duration of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation by 69 and 61%, respectively. The antiarrhythmic effect of apstatin was reversed by HOE140, a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, suggesting that apstatin is acting by potentiating endogenously formed bradykinin. The results demonstrate that the aminopeptidase P inhibitor apstatin is cardioprotective in this model of cardiac ischemia/ reperfusion injury.",

Blood pressure decreased within 2 weeks, and the antihypertensive effects were noted throughout the 12-month administration period. Left ventricular mass index decreased significantly after 2 months (120+/-12 to 106+/-9 g/m2; p < 0.01) and was normalized after 12 months (88+/-6 g/m2). Postischemic minimal vascular resistance in the forearm decreased gradually from 2.1+/-0.5 to 1.6+/-0.4 PRU at month 12 of temocapril treatment. In contrast, increased stiffness index beta of carotid artery was not altered during a 1-year treatment period (11.4+/-4.9 to 11.6+/-3.8 at month 12 of treatment). These data indicated that the regression of structural changes of left ventricle and arterioles occurred gradually and progressively for 1-year treatment with ACE inhibition, but large arteries were not affected.", 
    "336": "To determine whether nitrate tolerance is attenuated on aortas isolated from rats treated in the long term with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, five groups of rats were studied in parallel. Group 1 received ramipril, 1 mg/ kg/day, p.o., for 6 weeks; group 2 received ramipril at the same dose for 4 weeks, and the last 2 weeks, a cotreatment with ramipril plus HOE 140 (a bradykinin B2 antagonist, 500 microg/ kg/day, s.c. injections); group 3 received losartan, 2 mg/kg/day, p.o., for 6 weeks; group 4 received losartan at the same dose, and the last 2 weeks, a cotreatment with losartan plus HOE 140; and group 5 served as control. Rings of thoracic aorta from these groups were studied in organ baths. After nitroglycerin preincubation (10 microM for 30 min) in vitro, the dose-response curves to nitroglycerin were significantly shifted to the right in the control group but not in group 1. This protective effect was partially present in group 3; it was completely abolished in groups 2 and 4. In groups 1 and 3, it also was abolished after nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) inhibition (L-NMMA incubation) or removal of the endothelium. Superoxide anion accumulation (assessed by lucigenin chemiluminescence) was increased by nitroglycerin incubation in the control group but not in groups 1 and 3. After in vivo exposure to nitroglycerin (50 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily for 4 days), this protection against nitrate tolerance also was observed in groups 1 and 3. Thus long-term ACE inhibition prevents nitrate tolerance by an endothelium-dependent mechanism involving mainly an enhanced NO availability via B2-kinin receptor. This effect on the cNOS pathway seems to attenuate the superoxide anion accumulation induced by nitroglycerin exposure (probably via a downregulation of oxidative enzyme).", 
    "337": "The objective of this study was to analyze adrenergic receptors during cardiac hypertrophy development, after establishment of cardiac hypertrophy and after regression of cardiac hypertrophy by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was induced by abdominal aortic stenosis. After surgery, plasma norepinephrine concentrations (PNE) and left ventricular adrenergic receptors from rat hearts subjected to aortic stenosis were assessed during cardiac hypertrophy development (at 3, 7, 15, and 30 days of aortic stenosis), once cardiac hypertrophy had been established (7 and 14 weeks after the stenosis) and after regression of cardiac hypertrophy by an antihypertensive dose (200 mg/kg/day) of captopril. The presence of LVH was observed from day 7 after stenosis. PNE had significantly increased after 15 days but returned to control values 30 days after surgery. The density of alpha1-adrenoceptors was found to decrease with development of hypertrophy. Once hypertrophy had been established, 7 weeks from stenosis, PNE was not different from control; however, the density of alpha1-adrenoceptors continued to diminish, whereas PNE and the density of beta-adrenoceptors were no different from control values. Fourteen weeks after stenosis, a significant decrease in PNE was recorded, and no change in alpha1- but an increase in beta-adrenoceptors was observed. LVH was reversed by treatment with captopril; PNE was similar in control and stenosed treated animals. The density of alpha1-adrenoceptors was decreased when compared with control animals, and no change in the density of beta-adrenoceptors was observed with treatment. In conclusion, a decrease of alpha1-adrenoceptors was associated with LVH development and earlier stages of established cardiac hypertrophy. Later stages of established cardiac hypertrophy were characterized by no change in alpha1- and an increase in beta-adrenoceptors. Treatment with captopril induced LVH regression and decreased the number of alpha1-adrenoceptors without any change in beta-adrenoceptors.",

STZ-induced body weight changes and blood glucose concentration were not affected by either ENA or LP but both drugs significantly decreased cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations elevated in diabetic rats, inhibited kidney weight gain, and decreased albuminuria. Kidneys of STZ-diabetic rats had increased malondialdehyde content and decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes (Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase). Both ENA and LP decreased lipid peroxidation and augmented the activities of antioxidant enzymes studied in the kidneys of diabetic rats. These results confirm the role of oxidative stress in the development of diabetic nephropathy already at early stages of the development of diabetes and point to the possible antioxidative mechanism of the nephroprotective action of ENA and LP.",

We studied 17 women with arthritis and hypertension who were receiving fosinopril and HCTZ, and administered sequentially in random order ibuprofen, sulindac, and nabumetone for 1 month each, with an intervening 2-week washout period between each treatment period. During the washout period, subjects received acetaminophen. Blood pressure at the end of 2 weeks of acetaminophen was compared with blood pressure after 1 month of treatment with each of the NSAID. Mean blood pressure was unchanged before and after all NSAID: 108 +/- 7 v 107 +/- 9 for nabumetone, 108 +/-9 v 108 +/- 9 for sulindac, and 108 +/- 8 v 107 +/- 9 for ibuprofen. The 24-h urinary sodium excretion was not significantly different.

Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week run-in period) were randomly allocated to a double-blind, 12-week treatment with either a combination tablet of felodipine and metoprolol (Logimax), 5/50 mg daily (n = 321), enalapril, 10 mg daily (n = 321), or placebo (n = 304), with the possibility of doubling the dose after 4 or 8 weeks of treatment if needed (diastolic blood pressure remaining >90 mm Hg). The combined felodipine-metoprolol treatment controlled blood pressure (diastolic < or =90 mm Hg 24 h after dose) in 72% of patients after 12 weeks, as compared with 49% for enalapril and 30% for placebo. A dose adjustment was required in 38% of patients receiving the combination, in 63% of patients allocated to placebo, and 61% of enalapril-treated patients. The overall incidence of adverse events was 54.5% during felodipine-metoprolol treatment; the corresponding values for enalapril and placebo were 51.7% and 47.4%, respectively. Withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 18 patients treated with the combination, in 10 patients on enalapril, and 12 patients on placebo. No significant change in patients' well-being was observed in either of the three study groups. These results show that a fixed combination tablet of felodipine and metoprolol allows to normalize blood pressure in a substantially larger fraction of patients than enalapril given alone. This improved efficacy is obtained without impairing the tolerability. The fixed-dose combination of felodipine and metoprolol, therefore, may become a valuable option to initiate antihypertensive treatment.",

It is now clear that aldosterone/excess salt administration has been shown to produce both cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial cardiac fibrosis in rats. In clinical studies, it has been reported that aldosterone seems to play an important role in cardiac hypertrophy. However, it has still not been established whether aldosterone is involved in cardiac hypertrophy in patients with end-stage renal failure treated with hemodialysis. In the present study, we have analyzed the association between cardiac hypertrophy and aldosterone in 29 patients (18 patients with nondiabetic nephropathy and 11 patients with diabetic nephropathy) who developed end-stage renal disease and received hemodialysis. Among the nondiabetic patients, left ventricular mass index correlated significantly with plasma aldosterone concentrations during both before and after hemodialysis, but it did not correlate with plasma renin activity. Furthermore, left ventricular mass index also correlated with mean blood pressure. In contrast, these correlations were not seen in the diabetic patients, despite similar age distribution, duration of hemodialysis, and several echocardiographic parameters between two groups. In conclusion, our study provides new evidence for a relation between left ventricular hypertrophy and plasma aldosterone concentrations that seems to be independent of blood pressure in nondiabetic patients with end-stage renal failure treated with hemodialysis.",

Once the decision to initiate antihypertensive drug therapy has been made, JNC-VI recommends one of three paths for the choice of initial therapy: one path for patients with uncomplicated hypertension, another for those with well-defined indications for certain drugs and a third path for patients with various concomitant conditions in which one or another drug has favorable effects. At this time, the place for the newest class of antihypertensive drugs, the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, remains uncertain. Currently, they are considered reasonable alternatives for patients who have a compelling need for an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor but develop a cough while taking this medication. When data from ongoing trials become available, angiotensin II receptor antagonists may prove to be a good choice for initial therapy in many patients because of the favorable side effect profile of this class of drugs.", 
    "347": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been proven to be highly effective and are for the most part the drugs of choice in the treatment and control of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular dysfunction. Despite this, questions regarding side effects and compliance with this traditional pharmacological strategy remain. In view of these observations, coupled with recent advances in gene-transfer technology, our objective in this study was to determine whether the expression of ACE could be controlled on a permanent basis at a genetic level. We argued that the introduction of ACE antisense to inhibit the enzyme would be a prerequisite in considering the antisense gene therapy for the control of hypertension and other related pathological states. Retroviral vectors (LNSV) containing ACE sense (LNSV-ACE-S) and ACE antisense (LNSV-ACE-AS) sequences were constructed and were used in rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells (RPAECs) to determine the feasibility of this approach. Infection of rat RPAECs with LNSV-ACE-S and LNSV-ACE-AS resulted in a robust expression of transcripts corresponding to ACE-S and ACE-AS, respectively, for the duration of these experiments, ie, 8 consecutive passages. The expression of ACE-AS but not of ACE-S was associated with a permanent decrease of approximately 70% to 75% in ACE expression and a 50% increase in the B(max) for the AT(1)s. Although angiotensin II caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels in both ACE-S- and ACE-AS-expressing cells, the stimulation was significantly higher in ACE-AS-expressing RPAECs. In vivo experiments demonstrated a prolonged expression of ACE-AS transcripts in cardiovascularly relevant tissues of rats. This was associated with a long-term reduction in blood pressure by approximately 15 mm Hg, exclusively in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. These observations demonstrate that delivery of ACE-AS by retroviral vector results in a permanent inhibition of ACE and a long-term reduction in high blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.", 
    "348": "With the application of early reperfusion therapy after acute MI, the incidence and importance of nontransmural infarction is increasing. In a rat model with nontransmural infarction, we evaluated 1) the changes of LV dimension, LV interstitial fibrosis and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA expression and 2) the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist treatment. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 45 min of coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion, and five days after the operation the animals were randomized to untreated (n = 19), captopril-treated (n = 15) and losartan-treated (n = 14) groups. Twenty-six days after MI, echocardiographic examination revealed a remarkable dilatation of LV. Captopril or losartan treatment reduced the extent of LV cavity dilatation. Collagen volume fractions in noninfarcted septum as well as in peri-infarct area decreased with captopril or losartan treatment, compared to those of the untreated rats. In noninfarcted septum of untreated rats, TGF-beta1 mRNA expression increased more than two fold (P < 0.05 vs. pre-MI) 5 and 10 days after MI. Captopril or losartan treatment suppressed the acute induction of TGF-beta1 mRNA expressions. These results indicate that ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor antagonist treatment after nontransmural infarction 1) attenuates LV remodeling as in transmural infarction and 2) decreases interstitial fibrosis at least partly by blocking the acute induction of TGF-beta1 mRNA expression.", 
    "349": "We investigated the effect of an infusion of ramiprilat on the development of coronary endothelial dysfunction. In anesthetized dogs, the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine (ACh, 5 and 10 microg x min(-1) for 1 min) and serotonin (5-HT, 50 and 100 microg x min(-1) for 1 min) and the endothelium-independent vasodilator nitroglycerin (NTG, 50 and 100 microg x min(-1) for 1 min) were given intracoronarily (i.c.) both prior to and after 60 min of ischemia (I) and 180 min of reperfusion (R) of a coronary artery. During I/R the dogs received i.c. either saline (N = 22) or ramiprilat (40 ng/kg x min(-1), N = 14). At the end of the experiment, a biopsy of the most distal coronary bed was processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Prior to I/R all vasodilators induced a similar dose-related increase in coronary flow in both groups. Following I/R, in controls the responses to ACh and 5-HT were significantly blunted (ACh: -39% and -34%; 5-HT: -48% and -49%); those to NTG were unchanged. Ramiprilat significantly prevented the blunting of the responses to ACh (-5%, and -10%) and 5-HT (-11%, and -19%). SEM of control subepicardial arterioles showed adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium and crater formation. No craters were seen in the ramiprilat-treated dogs. Thus, an acute infusion of ramiprilat significantly prevents the development of coronary endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, the appearance of crater-like changes on the endothelial surface can be taken as a morphological marker of endothelial dysfunction.",

The chronic therapy is able to significantly improve quality of life and survival of affected patients. Previous studies showed that in most western countries, the established standard therapy is not given to all patients who would benefit from chronic treatment. The essential parts of today's myocardial infarction treatment consists of effective beta-blockade, inhibition of the angiotensin-conversion enzyme, inhibition of platelet aggregation and lipid lowering agents. This article reviews the clinical benefits which may be expected from each of these therapeutic approaches. Newer, but not yet proven strategies, like blockade of the angiotensin receptor subtype 1 and treatment with antioxidative agents will be discussed.", 
    "351": "Three alpha-mercaptoacyldipeptides differing essentially in the size of their C-terminal residues have been crystallized in the thermolysin active site. A new mode of binding was observed for 3 [HS-CH(CH(2)Ph)CO-Phe-Tyr] and 4 [HS-CH((CH(2))(4)CH(3))CO-Phe-Ala], in which the mercaptoacyl moieties act as bidentates with Zn-S and Zn-O distances of 2.3 and 2.4 A, respectively, the side chains fitting the S(1), S(1)', and S(2)' pockets. Moreover, a distance of 3.1 A between the sulfur atom and the OE1 of Glu(143) suggests that they are H-bonded and that one of these atoms is protonated. This H-bond network involving Glu(143), the mercaptoacyl group of the inhibitor, and the Zn ion could be considered a \"modified\" transition state mimic of the peptide bond hydrolysis. Due to the presence of the hindering (5-phenyl)proline, the inhibitor HS-CH(CH(2)Ph)CO-Gly-(5-Ph)Pro (2) interacts through the usual Zn monodentation via the thiol group and occupancy of S(1)' and S(2)' subsites by the aromatic moieties, the proline ring being outside the active site. The inhibitory potencies are consistent with these structural data, with higher affinities for 3 (4.2 x 10(-)(8) M) and 4 (4.8 x 10(-)(8) M) than for 2 (1.2 x 10(-)(6) M). The extension of the results, obtained with thermolysin being considered as the model of physiological zinc metallopeptidases, allows inhibitor-recognition modes for other peptidases, such as angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, to be proposed and opens interesting possibilities for the design of new classes of inhibitors.", 
    "352": "Advanced glycosylation endproduct (AGE) formation has been implicated in the development and progression of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In diabetic animals, aminoguanidine inhibits AGE-mediated cross-linking of proteins in vascular and renal tissue and slows the progression of renal disease. ACTION II is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing two dose levels of aminoguanidine with placebo on the progression of nephropathy in 599 type 2 diabetic patients with renal disease from 84 centers in the United States and Canada. The primary endpoint is time to doubling of serum creatinine concentration. Secondary endpoints include the effect of aminoguanidine on time to all-cause mortality, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, rate of change in indices of renal function (iothalamate, Cockcroft and Gault [C&G] calculated creatinine and measured creatinine clearances), proteinuria, retinopathy, circulating and urinary AGE levels, and estimation of the relationship between plasma aminoguanidine concentrations and primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and adverse events. Progression of macrovascular disease was monitored and fundus photography performed. Type 2 diabetic patients aged 30 to 70 years were eligible for the trial if their blood pressure was < or =180 mm Hg systolic and < or =120 mm Hg diastolic, serum creatinine concentration > or =1.0 mg/dL (in women) or > or =1.2 mg/dL (in men), C&G clearance > or =40 mL/min, and proteinuria > or =500 mg/d with diabetic retinopathy or diabetic nephropathy on renal biopsy. Recruitment began in July 1995 and terminated in December 1996. The trial randomized a total of 599 subjects. At baseline, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 58 (7.7) years, diabetes duration 16.5 (7.5) years, body mass index 32 kg/m2 (10-90% range 2642), arterial blood pressure 105 (12) mm Hg, C-peptide concentration 2.55 (1.71) ng/mL, serum glucose concentration 201 (89) mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c 8.7% (1.6), serum creatinine concentration 1.6 (0.5) mg/dL, iothalamate clearance 52 (25) mL/min/1.73 m2, proteinuria 4.1 (4.2) g/d, triglycerides 259 (214) mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 144 (40) mg/dL. Patients are 72% male, 68% white, 16% black, and 16% Asian American and Native American. At baseline, 76% were receiving concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 43% lipid-lowering agents. Follow-up in ACTION II was scheduled to continue through December 1998, so that follow-up was to be 2 years after the date of randomization of the final enrolled patient. The trial in fact ended in March 1998. This trial will contribute to our understanding of the natural history of type 2 diabetes mellitus-associated nephropathy and determine whether aminoguanidine will slow the progression of established diabetic renal disease.", 
    "353": "The objective of this multicenter trial, which included 28 clinical centers, was to determine if repeated low density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis using the Liposorber LA-15 system (Kaneka Corporation, Osaka, Japan) could lead to an additional acute and time averaged lowering of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in severely hypercholesterolemic patients whose cholesterol levels could not be controlled by appropriate diet and maximal drug therapy. A total of 6,798 treatments were performed on 120 patients, including eight homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), 75 heterozygous FH, and 37 unclassified FH or other hyperlipidemias, from 1988 through 1994. The mean TC and mean LDL-C levels at baseline were 410.0 and 333.9 mg/dl, respectively. LDL-apheresis was performed once a week or at least once every 2 weeks in all patients. During treatment with the Liposorber system, the mean acute percentage reduction was 52.6% for TC and 63.1% for LDL-C. Very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) were also substantially reduced to 60.6% and 47.5%, respectively. Fibrinogen, a potential risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), was reduced by 26.2%. In contrast, the mean acute reduction of high density lipoprotein (HDL) was only 3.4%. The adverse events (AE) were those generally associated with extracorporeal treatments. The most common AE was hypotension, with 69 episodes corresponding to 1% of all treatments reported in 44 of the 120 patients treated. All other kinds of AE occurred in <0.2% of the treatments. The treatment with the Liposorber LA-15 system was overall well tolerated. It should be noted, however, that a more severe type of hypotensive reaction was reported in patients taking concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medication. With the exception of such anaphylactoid-like reactions associated with the intake of ACE-inhibitors, the Liposorber LA-15 system represents a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients suffering from severe hypercholesterolemia that could not be adequately controlled by diet and maximal drug therapy.", 
    "354": "We experienced a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) successfully treated with milrinone. He had been diagnosed as having CHF since 24 years of age when he began to have mechanical ventilation with a nasal mask at home. Although angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was effective for his CHF, cardiac function worsened year by year. Respiratory infection triggered the exacerbation of CHF at the end of 1997 (27 years old). On admission to our hospital on January 7, 1998, PaO2 was 48 mmHg and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) was 62%. Both ventricles were dilated and ventricular wall motility was markedly reduced on ultrasonocardiography. Ejection fraction of the left ventricle (LVEF) was 5%. Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 760 pg/ml. Continuous intravenous infusion of milrinone was started on January 8 at the rate of 0.25-0.35 microgram/kg/min. His general condition improved and LVEF increased up to 15% on January 27. No serious side effects were observed. Even after milrinone withdrawal, his cardiac condition remained stable until the end of February 1998. Temporary deteriorated CHF due to urinary tract infection was successfully treated by chemotherapy and milrinone. Subsequently he was discharged on March 13 and could stay in his home for 7 weeks uneventfully with milrinone infusion therapy. When he was readmitted to the hospital for evaluation of CHF on April 30, CTR was 44%, LVEF was 20% and BNP was 44 pg/ml. CHF is one of the life threatening complications for DMD. Although catecholamine is a well utilized agent for advanced CHF, it has limited effect in DMD, because beta receptors are down-regulated due to long-lasting cardiac dysfunction. Increased heart rate and arrhytmia are also serious problems during catecholamine therapy. Milrinone is a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor having inotropic and vasodilatic actions with modest increase of heart rate and little torelance. Milrinone is probably effective in improving CHF of DMD and has less side effects as compared to catecholamine. We concluded that milrinone might improve quality of lives of DMD patients with advanced CHF, although further cumultative studies are necessary to confirm its effectiveness and safety.", 
    "355": "Renal excreted angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril, and renal.hepatic bile excreted ACE inhibitor temocapril, were compared by monitoring serum ACE and renal ACE expression (protein and mRNA) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Serum ACE levels did not change in untreated diabetic rats or in those treated with temocapril, compared with normal control rats. However, serum ACE levels significantly increased in diabetic rats treated with captopril after 3 months (153.8 +/- 23.0 vs. 43.5 +/- 5.5 IU/l/37 degrees C, p < 0.01) and 6 months (113.6 +/- 9.3 vs. 36.9 +/- 2.9 IU/l/37 degrees C, p < 0.01) compared with normal control rats. Compared with normal control rats (3.6 +/- 0.4), proximal tubular ACE protein expression significantly (p < 0.01) decreased in untreated diabetic rats (1.6 +/- 1.1), but significantly (p < 0.01) increased in diabetic rats treated with captopril (3.7 +/- 0.3) and temocapril (3.5 +/- 0.4). Renal ACE mRNA levels decreased in untreated diabetic rats (125.5 +/- 20.3 vs. 313.3 +/- 53.4, p < 0.01) compared with normal control rats for 6 months. Renal ACE mRNA levels tended to increase in diabetic rats treated with captopril (184.4 +/- 51.2 vs. 125.5 +/- 20.3) and temocapril (165.4 +/- 43.2 vs. 125.5 +/- 20.3) compared with untreated diabetic rats for 6 months. In conclusion, diabetic rats had lower proximal tubular ACE protein expression and lower renal ACE mRNA levels compared with normal control rats. Furthermore, both ACE inhibitors increased renal ACE protein and mRNA expression, but differed in their effect on serum ACE levels.",

Twenty-four compounds were efficient in significantly increasing the local pO(2) in a majority of tumors. The increase of local pO(2) using pharmacological treatments was lower than that achieved by using oxygen or carbogen breathing.

    "357": "The importance of angiotensin type-1 (AT1) receptor stimulation during renal development has recently been established in both pharmacological and knockout models. We have previously reported irreversible and progressive papillary atrophy and a reduced baseline renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) after neonatal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. The aim of the present study was to investigate the consequences of these abnormalities on urinary sodium excretion during acute extracellular sodium loading. Rats were treated neonatally with enalapril (10 mg kg-1 day-1) or saline control from days 3 to 23 after birth. Urinary sodium excretion was assessed in relation to mean arterial pressure (MAP) and RIHP responses in adult anaesthetised rats during moderate (1.5 and 3 % body weight) and severe (9 % body weight) saline-induced volume expansion. Control rats responded to the moderate volume expansion by increasing MAP by 16 +/- 6 % and RIHP by 40 +/- 23 %, respectively. In neonatally enalapril-treated rats, however, MAP and RIHP remained unchanged and were associated with a smaller increase in sodium excretion (44 +/- 11 % of the total amount infused versus 71 +/- 16 % for controls, P < 0.05). In contrast, severe volume expansion resulted in marked pressure rises in both the enalapril-treated group (36 +/- 12 and 112 +/- 48 % of baseline for MAP and RIHP, respectively) and the control group (34 +/- 21 and 130 +/- 34 % of baseline for MAP and RIHP, respectively). Moreover, the increases in MAP and RIHP were associated with complete excretion of the severe sodium challenge within 60 min in both treatment groups. We conclude that a RIHP response appears to be a prerequisite for adequate urinary sodium excretion in this model of papillary atrophy. Hence, an intact renal medulla is not mandatory in the renal handling of sodium during extracellular loading.",

After augmentation of enalapril to 40 mg daily, patients in the E10 group showed an increase in maximal oxygen consumption and a decrease in neurohormonal stimulation, whereas the opposite changes were observed after reduction of enalapril to 10 mg daily in patients in the E20 and E40 groups (maximal oxygen consumption: Delta1.1 +/- 2.0 vs -1.0 +/- 1.9 mL. kg(-1). min(-1), P <.01; ANP: Delta-63 +/- 106 vs 19 +/- 54 pg/mL, P <.01; BNP: Delta-62 +/- 104 vs 18 +/- 89 pg/mL, P <.05; norepinephrine: Delta-1.3 +/- 2.9 vs 0.6 +/- 1.8, P <.05).

These unmet goals are the reasons why new antihypertensive drugs are synthesized and tested in the clinical practice. This paper briefly mentions the goals of new antihypertensive agents and examines the main pharmacological and clinical features of new classes of antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin II receptor blockers, central agents, vasopeptidase inhibitors, and endothelin antagonists.

Several medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers, have been reported to be successful in the treatment of microvascular angina. Control of hypertension and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy are important in controlling symptoms associated with this intriguing problem. The role of nitric oxide and the effects of L-arginine in the pathogenesis and treatment of hypertension and microvascular angina need to be elucidated. Optimal treatment will depend on the appropriate classification and diagnosis of chest pain in patients with hypertension and normal coronary angiograms.", 
    "368": "The management of hypertension and nephropathy, in both diabetes and other forms of renal disease, is usually based on blood pressure reduction through an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-based treatment regimen. With particular respect to the choice of ACE inhibitor drug, there are no definitive direct comparisons in the treatment of renal disease. In terms of blood pressure reduction, however, there is evidence that spirapril is at least as effective as the reference ACE inhibitor, enalapril. However, patients with diabetic nephropathy and/or chronic renal failure are at potential risk from drug accumulation if the preferred agent relies predominantly on glomerular filtration for its elimination. In this respect spirapril may have an advantage because it has been shown that there are no clinically relevant increases in the spirapril(at) concentrations (24 h post-dose) even in the setting of advanced renal failure (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min). Thus, there is no requirement to modify the dose and no concerns about drug accumulation or the potential for exaggerated therapeutic or adverse effects. In summary, an ACE inhibitor drug is seen as an integral component of the drug treatment regimen for patients with nephropathy. Where there is renal failure it may be prudent to administer a drug, such as spirapril, which also has alternative elimination mechanisms.", 
    "369": "The efficacy and tolerability of spirapril were evaluated in a prospective, multicentre, post-marketing surveillance study on the treatment of arterial hypertension in 5000 patients, most of whom had received a single daily dose of 6 mg spirapril. The study was carried out by internists and general practitioners. In accordance with placebo-controlled clinical trials, spirapril was proven to be a very effective antihypertensive drug, in respect of both the mean reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure achieved as well as the responder rate of 89.4% and 85.4% for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Efficacy was equally good in single drug treatment and combination treatment. Differentiated evaluation of blood pressure values in respect of the severity of hypertension on the basis of the World Health Organization classification showed a clear relationship between the baseline blood pressure and the reduction in blood pressure. The higher the baseline blood pressure, the more pronounced was the antihypertensive efficacy; a particular reduction in diastolic blood pressure being observed. Tolerability was also good, with an incidence of side effects of only 2.9%. Coughing was observed in only 0.88% of patients. Thus spirapril is seen to be an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug whose efficacy is clearly related to baseline blood pressure and thus is also very effective in the treatment of severe forms of hypertension.", 
    "370": "Spirapril is a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It is a prodrug with a resorption of about 50%. The active metabolite spiraprilat reaches maximal plasma concentration within 2-3 h after oral administration. Spirapril can be administered once daily because of its long duration of action caused by an elimination half-life of about 40 h. It undergoes renal and hepatic elimination. In contrast to other ACE inhibitors it has a narrow dose range; therefore, the recommended dose is 6 mg for most patients without the need for dose titration. Spirapril has no relevant drug interactions. In several studies, spirapril was given to patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension at doses of 1-24 mg/day. There was an identical blood pressure lowering effect at doses of 6-24 mg/day; doses of 1-3 mg/day were less effective. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure monitoring showed a trough:peak ratio up to 0.84. In studies comparing the effect of spirapril with enalapril, lisinopril, trandolapril or captopril, spirapril was at least as effective as the other substances. Besides treating uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, spirapril can be used in patients with diseases accompanying hypertension such as heart and renal diseases, diabetes mellitus, and lipid disturbances. Possible advantages of spirapril compared to other ACE inhibitors are the dual mechanism of elimination, the lack of need for dose titration and a low incidence of cough.", 
    "371": "In the present review, we discuss the role of clinical dosing of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction. Although the precise mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors is still unresolved, the clinical efficacy of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction is well established. However, it is unclear whether the doses used in clinical trials translate directly into daily practice. Several reasons may cause differences between clinical practice and controlled trials: (1) clinical trials used higher doses than in normal practice; (2) some patients may be relatively 'resistant' to ACE inhibition; and/or (3) ACE activity increases during ACE inhibitor therapy and may provide escape mechanisms when the drug regimen is not strictly adhered to. Therefore, it is of interest that recent trials suggest that only the higher doses of ACE inhibition are clinically efficacious. In conclusion, it is suggested that optimal benefit from treatment with an ACE inhibitor in patients with left ventricular dysfunction requires sufficient and frequent dosing of the ACE inhibitor, e.g., enalapril 10 mg twice daily or captopril 25 mg three times daily.", 
    "372": "Strategically located between the circulating blood and the vascular smooth muscle, endothelial cells release numerous vasoactive substances regulating the function of vascular smooth muscle and circulating blood cells. Endothelium-derived vasodilators include prostacyclin, nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. In particular, nitric oxide inhibits cellular growth and migration. In concert with prostacyclin, nitric oxide exerts potent antiatherogenic and thromboresistant properties by preventing platelet aggregation and cell adhesion. These effects are counterbalanced by vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and endothelin (ET)-1, both of which exert prothrombotic and growth-promoting properties. In hypertension, elevated blood pressure causes vascular disease by inducing endothelial dysfunction. Hence, modern therapeutic strategies in human hypertension focus on preserving or restoring endothelial integrity. Beyond inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors diminish the inactivation of bradykinin, thus leading to an augmentation of nitric oxide release. In addition, the compounds stabilize the B2-receptor, and reduce oxidative stress and tissue ET-1 levels. In patients with coronary artery disease, chronic ACE inhibition improves endothelial function. Further clinical studies are already under way which will prove whether these beneficial vascular effects of ACE inhibitors on endothelial dysfunction result in a clinical benefit for patients with hypertension.", 
    "373": "Vasodilator therapy with nitrates has been used for almost a century to bring relief to patients suffering from angina. The acute anti-ischemic effects of nitro-vasodilators for the treatment and prevention of anginal attacks is unquestioned. In addition, nitrates are administered in order to reduce symptomatic and silent ischemic episodes, in patients with proven coronary heart disease who exert ST segment alterations on Holter monitoring. The reduction in total ischemic burden may result in an improved prognosis with regard to infarct prevention and possible prevention of deterioration of left ventricular function due to repetitive episodes of myocardial ischemia. In patients with unstable angina, administration of nitrates significantly diminishes ischemic episodes and reduces the number of clinically symptomatic anginal attacks. The prevention of left ventricular dilatation in patients within the first few days and months following acute myocardial infarction may be due to the reduced preload. In patients with heart failure, preload reduction with nitrates and afterload reduction with hydralazine was tested versus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, unfortunately, very few data are available concerning the combination therapy of ACE inhibitors and nitrates in heart failure and following acute myocardial infarction. Long-term continuous administration of high doses of nitrates may cause nitrate tolerance, thus reducing the vasodilator potency of these drugs. Since nitrates were introduced into medical therapy many decades before randomized controlled trials were performed, and evidence-based medicine became the basic principal for medical therapy, there are still indications and situations where the full therapeutic potential of nitrates is not being fully appreciated. During recent decades, other anti-ischemic drugs, i.e., beta-receptor agonists and calcium channel blockers, were introduced into the clinical setting and contributed to an optimized therapy for patients with coronary heart disease. Nevertheless, due to their proven and unsurmounted symptomatic efficacy, nitrates will remain one of the cornerstones of acute and long-term therapy of patients with coronary heart disease far beyond the year 2000.", 
    "374": "We investigated the contribution of chymase-dependent conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in hamster cheek pouch. To investigate the converting activities in intact tissues, angiotensin I or II was applied to microvessels of the intact cheek pouch, and the vascular contractile response was recorded. Angiotensin I or angiotensin II (20 nM) induced a rapid contraction of arterioles, irrespective of their diameter. In the presence of I mM captopril, there was no contraction in response to angiotensin I in arterioles < 25 microm in diameter, whereas contraction was still observed in larger arterioles. Chymostatin (100 microM) treatment also reduced the response to angiotensin I in arterioles > 40 microm in diameter. Treatment with 1 mM captopril and 100 microM chymostatin resulted in the loss of response to angiotensin I, but not to angiotensin II, in all arterioles. Treatment of microvessels with 100 microg/ml compound 48/80 enhanced angiotensin I-induced vascular contraction response, suggesting the significance of mast cells as a source of cheek pouch chymase.",

Porcine large coronary arteries contracted with prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha, 10 microM) did not relax to bradykinin (0.1 nM - 0.1 microM), but did relax to sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10 microM). However, after eversion of the segments, bradykinin induced relaxations with pD2 values and maximal responses of 8.78+/-0.09 and 75+/-2% (n=6), respectively. 3. Incubation with captopril (1 microM) did not reveal a relaxation to bradykinin in the normal vessel configuration and had no influence on the concentration-relaxation relationship in everted segments. 4. Lowering the luminal pressure in contracted segments from 131+/-5 mmHg (isometric, n=5) to 60 mmHg (isobaric, n=5) did not facilitate the action of bradykinin. 5. Eversion of segments did not influence the concentration-response relationship for K+ (4.7 - 125 mM), PGF2alpha (0.3 - 30 microM), and SNP (30 nM - 30 microM), although the time-courses of responses were faster when the agents were added from the intimal compared to the adventitial side of the preparation. 6. In the same everted segment contracted with PGF2alpha, the concentration-response relationship for bradykinin was not different under isometric and isobaric conditions. 7. These results indicate that, (1) reduced endothelium-dependent relaxations to adventitially administered substances can be ascribed to a diffusion barrier in the vessel wall, while enzymatic degradation, luminal pressure and precontractile responses seem not to play a role, (2) impedance planimetry applied to everted cylindrical segments could be a useful experimental approach in pharmacological studies of endothelium-dependent responses under isobaric and isometric conditions.",

The somatic (two domains) and testicular (single domain) isoenzymes demonstrated different kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of these substrates. All of the inhibitors were competitive inhibitors of both ACE isoforms, and the Ki values were substrate-independent. The relative potencies of the inhibitors for both enzymes were: lisinopril > captopril > PP-09 > enalapril > PP-36 > PP-35 > phosphoramidon. The inhibition efficiency of PP-09 was comparable with those of the well-known ACE inhibitors. Captopril was more effectively bound to the somatic ACE (Ki = 0.5 nM) than to the testicular isoform (Ki = 6.5 nM).",

    "382": "We studied the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on angiotensin II (Ang II) induced growth related signalling pathways in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts. In BrdU proliferation assays, Ang II (10(-9)-10(-7) M) stimulated cardiac fibroblast growth in a dose-dependent fashion (maximum at 10(-7) M, 5.22 +/- 0.01-fold, n = 9). 2-2-(1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl)[amino-oxopropyl]-6,7-dimethoxy- 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3 carboxylic acid (moexiprilat) led to a dose-dependent inhibition of the Ang II induced cardiac fibroblast growth. A less pronounced effect on cellular proliferation was seen with the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in this direct antiproliferative effect of ACE inhibitors in cardiac fibroblasts, we studied the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases [MAPKs: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and p38-MAPK] and JAK/STAT janus kinases/signal transducer and activator of transcription) signal transduction pathways. Ang II (10(-7) M) caused an increase in MAPKs activity with an increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (1.7-fold) and p38-MAPK (3.6-fold). This effect was completely inhibited by moexiprilat (10(-7) M) and enalaprilat (10(-7) M). Stimulation with Ang II (10(-7) M) also led to an increased phosphorylation of STAT3, which is one of the key effector proteins in the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. This effect was also completely inhibited by moexiprilat (10(-7) M) and enalaprilat (10(-7) M). These data show that the ACE inhibitors moexiprilat and enalaprilat inhibit Ang II induced proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts according to their relative potency of ACE inhibition in vitro. This novel effect of ACE inhibitors is accompanied by blocking the Ang II induced activation of several intracellular signal transduction pathways (ERK1/2, p38-MAPK and STAT3).",

Severe exfoliative rashes have also been associated with captopril, but a combined presentation of toxic epidermal necrolysis and agranulocytosis has not been previously described. We report an unusual case of captopril-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis with agranulocytosis in a patient with no known risk factors. The bone marrow suppression was successfully treated using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and the white blood cell (WBC) count recovered within 3 days after starting therapy. This case underscores the early experience with captopril, which showed a strong correlation between high doses used to treat hypertension and bone marrow suppression.",

We assessed the prevalence and predictors of patients with IDC that showed marked reverse remodeling (a decrease in LV end-diastolic dimension > or = 5 mm to a final LV end-diastolic dimension < or = 55 mm and an increase in percent LV fractional shortening > or = 5% to a final percent fractional shortening of > or = 25% and a decrease in LV mass > or = 10%) after 2 years of intensive therapy with ACE inhibitors and/or beta blockers. In 78 patients with IDC (mean age 51 +/- 14 years), the clinical, echocardiographic, hemodynamic, laboratory, and endomyocardial biopsy data were evaluated at diagnosis and serial echocardiography was performed for 2 years. After 2 years of therapy, 20 of 78 patients (26%) showed marked reverse remodeling. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher systolic blood pressure (135 +/- 17 vs 120 +/- 16 mm Hg, p <0.001) and lower pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (7 +/- 3 vs 12 +/- 8 mm Hg, p <0.01) at diagnosis were independent predictors of reverse remodeling. Then, we further analyzed the prognosis of these patients for a mean of 50 +/- 32 months; 5-year survival (p <0.02) and event-free rates (p = 0.001) were better in patients with reverse remodeling than in patients without reverse remodeling.",

For those patients who do not respond to any of the primary therapeutic agents, there are now other therapies available like angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, dipyridamole, low dose warfarin including protein restriction and therapy aimed at hypercholesterolaemia in an attempt to retard progression to end stage renal failure.

    "386": "Telmisartan 1-O-acylglucuronide, the principal metabolite of telmisartan in humans, was characterized in terms of chemical stability and the structure of its isomerization products was elucidated. In addition, pharmacokinetics of telmisartan 1-O-acylglucuronide were assessed in rats after i.v. dosing. Similar to other acylglucuronides, telmisartan 1-O-acylglucuronide and diclofenac 1-O-acylglucuronide, which was used for comparison, showed the formation of different isomeric acylglucuronides on incubation in aqueous buffer. The isomeric acylglucuronides of telmisartan consisted of the 2-O-, 3-O-, and 4-O-acylglucuronides (alpha,beta-anomers). First order degradation half-lives of 26 and 0. 5 h were observed on incubation in buffer of pH 7.4 for the 1-O-acylglucuronides of telmisartan and diclofenac, respectively. This indicated that the 1-O-acylglucuronide of telmisartan was among the most stable acylglucuronides reported to date. The high stability of telmisartan 1-O-acylglucuronide was confirmed by in vitro experiments that indicated only very low covalent binding of telmisartan acylglucuronide to human serum albumin but a considerable amount of covalently bound radioactivity with the acylglucuronide of diclofenac. After i.v. dosing to rats, telmisartan 1-O-acylglucuronide was rapidly cleared from plasma with a clearance of 180 ml/min/kg, compared with 15.6 ml/min/kg for the parent compound. Because telmisartan 1-O-acylglucuronide exhibited a comparably high chemical stability together with a high clearance that resulted in low systemic exposure, the amount of covalent binding to proteins should be negligible compared with other frequently used drugs, such as furosemide, ibuprofen, or salicylic acid.", 
    "387": "The intestinal peptide transport system has broad substrate specificities. In addition to its physiological function of absorbing di- and tripeptides resulting from the digestion of dietary proteins, this transport system also absorbs some orally administered peptidomimetic drugs, including beta-lactam antibiotics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, renin inhibitors, bestatin, thrombin inhibitors, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone and its analogues. There have been several studies on the mechanism and substrate structure-affinity relationship for this transport system. Rapid progress has been made recently in studies on the molecular basis of the intestinal peptide transport system. A protein apparently involved in peptide transport has been isolated from rabbit small intestines, and genes for human intestinal peptide transporters have been cloned, sequenced and functionally expressed. This review summarizes these studies and addresses the pharmaceutical potential of the intestinal peptide transport system.", 
    "388": "Role of tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the development of pressure-overload cardiovascular hypertrophy was examined in rats by comparing the inhibitory effect of trandolapril (high efficiency on tissue ACE) with that of enalapril (low efficiency) at equally antihypertensive doses. Rats with abdominal aorta banded or sham-operated were orally treated with trandolapril (0.5 mg/kg per day), enalapril (20 mg/kg per day) or vehicle for 8 weeks after the surgical maneuvers. In vehicle-treated rats, the banding raised the intra-aortic systolic pressure by 58%, diastolic pressure by 31%, maximum velocity of pressure rise by 65%, left ventricular (LV) weight by 41%, LV hydroxyproline concentration by 56%, aortic mass by 46%, LV ACE activity by 45%, and aortic ACE activity by 265%. Although both drugs equally reduced the aortic systolic pressure to approx. 70% and diastolic pressure to approx. 80% that of banded rats receiving vehicle, trandolapril partially prevented the LV hypertrophy, whereas enalapril yielded nonsignificant suppression. Trandolapril completely prevented the LV increments in hydroxyproline and ACE activity, whereas enalapril partially inhibited the LV hydroxyproline increase with little inhibition of LV ACE activity. In contrast, both inhibitors almost completely prevented the aortic hypertrophy, with the ACE activity of the aorta being potently inhibited. These results suggest that tissue ACE is the principal factor for pressure-induced aortic hypertrophy and an important yet non-essential factor for LV hypertrophy.",

Patients with systolic dysfunction, tolerant or intolerant to an ACE-inhibitor, and patients with preserved systolic function are included. Specifically, the CHARM program consists of 3 independent, parallel, placebo-controlled studies in patients with (1) LVEF less than or equal to 40%, ACE-inhibitor treated (n = 2,300); (2) LVEF less than or equal to 40%, ACE-inhibitor intolerant (n = 1,700); (3) LVEF greater than 40%, not treated with ACE inhibitors (n = 2,500). The 3 studies will be combined to evaluate the effect of candesartan cilexetil on all-cause mortality in the broad spectrum of symptomatic heart failure. The primary objective in each trial is to evaluate the effects on the combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or CHF hospitalization. Other endpoints include the effects on myocardial infarction, all-cause hospitalization, and resource utilization. CHARM is intended to randomize 6,500 patients with symptomatic heart failure from 26 countries in Europe, the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Australia.

All studies were performed 6 weeks after MI or sham surgery. In muscles from sham-operated rats, increasing stimulation frequency from 0.33 to 3.0 Hz was associated with no change in the peak amplitude or the time to the peak of the Ca2+i transients. In contrast, in muscles from MI rats, stimulation at 3.0 Hz caused a marked increase in the amplitude of the Ca2+i transients (170% of baseline), prolongation of the time to the peak of the Ca2+i transient (54 +/- 2 to 84 +/- 8 * ms), and a prominent alternans pattern. Tissue hypoxia did not appear to be responsible for the abnormal response to rapid stimulation in the myocardium from infarcted hearts because bubbling the bath solution with 95% N2/5% CO2 resulted in no change in the amplitude of the Ca2+i transients in muscles from both groups. Muscles from captopril-treated MI rats responded like sham-operated controls, with no change in the amplitude or time course of the Ca2+i transients during rapid stimulation.", 
    "393": "In myocardium isolated from rats with postinfarction heart failure, increasing stimulation frequency causes marked increases in peak Ca2+i , prolongation of the time course of the Ca2+i transient, and Ca2+i alternans. Despite the increased Ca2+i transients, contractility declined during rapid pacing. We hypothesize that these changes could be explained by a frequency-related decline in intracellular pH and/or a decrease in sarcolemmal Ca2+ extrusion. The frequency-dependent abnormalities of cellular Ca2+ regulation in the infarcted heart are prevented by long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor.",

In both trials, black patients had a lower incidence of coronary artery disease, greater incidence of previous hypertension, and a greater cardiothoracic ratio (P < .05) than white patients. In V-HeFT II, plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly less in blacks; plasma renin activity was less only in blacks with a history of hypertension. Overall mortality or hospitalization for congestive heart failure did not differ between blacks and whites in the placebo group in V-HeFT I. However, the mortality of black patients receiving hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate (H-I) was reduced (P = .04) in V-HeFT I, whereas white patients showed no difference from placebo. In V-HeFT II, only white patients showed a mortality reduction from enalapril therapy compared with H-I therapy (P = .02). Whites also showed evidence of greater blood pressure reduction and enhanced regression of cardiac size in response to enalapril.

Plasma half-life of thrombostatin had a t1/2alpha of 2.6 min and a t1/2beta of 24 min in rabbits. Ligating the renal arteries did not prolong clearance (t1/2alpha = 2.4 min; t1/2beta = 12 min). Thrombostatin produced a prolonged in vivo antiplatelet effect. At 30 min after a single intravenous administration in rabbits, thrombostatin's plasma concentration was <8.7 microM (5 microg/ml). However, ex vivo 20 and 40 nM gamma-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation of these rabbits' platelets was inhibited 40% for 2.75 and 1 h, respectively. In vitro, flow cytometry studies revealed that thrombostatin specifically bound to human platelets and washed human platelets treated with thrombostatin were less responsive to gamma-thrombin than control platelets. Using electrolytic injury to induce coronary artery thrombosis, dogs treated with thrombostatin, aspirin, or combined thrombostatin and aspirin occluded in 62+/-25 (mean +/- SD), 62+/-36, or 89+/-32 min versus untreated animals which occluded at 39+/-27 min, (p<0.01, p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively).

Blockade of aldosterone in these patients may be necessary to overcome so-called aldosterone escape during chronic ACE-inhibition. The beneficial effects of spironolactone may relate to enhanced diuresis, anti-arrhythmogenic properties and direct effects on the myocardium and blood vessels.

    "416": "AVP-a had no effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP) in awake or anesthetized animals, but reduced MAP by 20.0+/-2.2% in the anesthetized rats which previously had been treated with SAR and/or HEX. SAR infusion had no effect on MAP when administered to conscious rats, but decreased MAP by 12.0+/-4.4% during anesthesia. Ganglionic blockade with HEX consistently lowered MAP in the conscious and anesthetized animals.", 
    "417": "It is concluded that AVP contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure when the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and/or RAS are blocked during isoflurane anesthesia. SAR infusion leads to hypotension during anesthesia, but not in conscious rats. These findings indicate that AII is of importance for blood pressure maintenance during isoflurane anesthesia in rats, and that apparent pressor effects of AVP come into play when RAS and/or ANS are blocked.", 
    "418": "The pigmentary purpuras (PPs) are a heterogeneous group of dermatoses defined by specific clinicopathologic features but sharing, at the light microscopic level, superficially disposed dermal lymphocytic infiltrates and hemorrhage. The term atypical pigmentary purpura (APP) is used by the authors in reference to cases of PP in which individual lesions, although clinically presenting as PP, show morphological features typically associated with mycosis fungoides (MF) including Sezary cells and epidermotropism. The integrated concept of lymphocyte atypia and PP is a confusing and enigmatic one to which reference in the literature has been previously made. Specifically, there are reports of PP presaging fully evolved MF, lymphoid atypia has been identified in lesions of routine PP and MF with purpuric features has been described. The clinical, light microscopic, and genomic features of biopsied lesions showing pathological features of APP and which clinically were consistent with PP is explored.", 
    "419": "The light microscopy of skin biopsy specimens from 34 patients with a pathological diagnosis of APP was correlated to medical and drug histories. In 14 cases, adequate tissue was present in the paraffin blocks to allow DNA extraction. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in these 14 cases to explore for rearrangement of the T-cell receptor. Fisher's exact test and pair wise exact tests were used to assess the significance of histological differences between cases determined by dinical features to be of MF- or drug-related origin, or to be idiopathic in nature.", 
    "420": "Of 34 patients, 7 were held to have MF related PP; specifically these patients had violaceous, infiltrative, variably purpuric plaques on trunk, buttocks, and thighs accompanied by typical PP lesions which occurred either concomitant to or preceded the MF lesions. In 10 cases, a diagnosis of idiopathic PP was made whereby the clinical presentation was characteristic of PP; there were no concomitant lesions suspicious for MF and a drug-based origin was excluded. A drug-based origin was established in 17 patients based on lesional onset related to initiation (5 patients) and/or resolution after discontinuation (12 patients) of drugs including calcium channel blockers, lipid-lowering agents, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antihistamines, antidepressants, or analgesics. There was considerable overlap histologically between all 3 groups including the degree of lymphoid atypia in the dermis, the presence of dermal-based Sezary cells, the degree and pattern of epidermotropism, the paucity of other inflammatory cell elements, and the presence of laminated dermal sclerosis. Morphological features predictive of MF related APP over the other 2 groups were intraepidermal lymphocytes which were more atypical than the dermal-based infiltrate. Intraepidermal Sezary cells were less frequent in biopsies of drug-related APP relative to idiopathic PP (IPP) and MF related PP. PCR studies conducted in 14 cases (2 cases of MF, 6 cases of drug-related APP, and 6 cases of IPP) revealed clonality in 2 cases of drug-related APP and 2 cases of IPP; the 2 studied MF-related cases did nor show clonal restriction.", 
    "421": "APP should not be equated with purpuric MF; it is not necessarily a precursor lesion of MF, and may be of drug-based origin. Clinical features are critical to the final assessment because there is overlap pathologically in the 3 clinical subtypes of APP.", 
    "422": "Recent international guidelines on the detection, clinical assessment and management of patients with hypertension have highlighted a number of themes that should be incorporated into routine clinical practice. First, although antihypertensive therapy is having a major impact on reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and heart failure, community surveys show that most hypertensive patients remain untreated or have suboptimal blood pressure control. Second, the guidelines have emphasised the importance of making an overall assessment of individual patients to gauge their absolute risk of a cardiovascular event; risk factors include not only blood pressure but also target organ damage, the presence of coexisting symptomatic vascular disease and the number of associated cardiovascular risk factors. Patients at the highest risk, especially those with diabetes, the elderly and patients with target organ damage, merit vigorous antihypertensive therapy, and such patients often require treatment with more than one drug to achieve target levels of blood pressure (< 135/80 mm Hg). An additional important theme in recent guidelines has been a move towards using lower dosages and therapies that provide 24-hour blood pressure control with once-daily administration. Since diuretics have been reaffirmed as evidence-based first-line therapy in a broad spectrum of patients with hypertension, especially the elderly, a new lower dosage sustained release formulation of indapamide has been developed (indapamide SR 1.5 mg). Recent multicentre European clinical trials have defined the efficacy and tolerability of indapamide SR 1.5 mg, both relative to other antihypertensive drugs and in key subgroups of patients. Indapamide SR 1.5 mg has an antihypertensive effect, maintained throughout the 24-hour administration interval, equivalent to that of immediate release indapamide 2.5 mg, but the new formulation has even less effect on circulating K+ levels. Indapamide SR 1.5 mg is at least as effective as amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a comparative study of indapamide SR 1.5 mg and enalapril (the LIVE study) used a rigorous unique study design with blinded reading of echocardiograms to show that after 1 year the ACE inhibitor had no significant effect on LVH regression, whereas indapamide SR 1.5 mg produced significant reductions in left ventricular mass index. Diuretic-based therapy for hypertension has been reaffirmed in international guidelines as effective first-line therapy, especially in the elderly and patients with LVH. Indapamide SR 1.5 mg shows an improved efficacy-tolerability profile, with impressive 24-hour effects on blood pressure, important ancillary properties with regard to LVH and cardiovascular protection.", 
    "423": "Indapamide is a thiazide-related diuretic drug with antihypertensive properties. Its blood pressure-lowering action has been repeatedly demonstrated in acute as well as chronic conditions in various genetically and nongenetically determined forms of hypertension. In rats, the maximally effective oral dose is 3 mg/kg/24 h. The natriuretic effect of indapamide peaked at 3-fold at a dose of 1 mg/kg. In accordance with its antihypertensive properties, indapamide was shown to have excellent efficacy in protecting against target organ damage (heart, kidneys, brain). In addition to its natriuretic effect, it has been shown in several experiments that indapamide lowers the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, exhibits calcium antagonist properties, enhances the production of prostacyclin, and limits the production of free radicals and of endothelium-dependent vasoconstrictor substances. These effects, even though they are observed at high indapamide concentrations and in a possibly species-dependent manner, may contribute to the beneficial properties of indapamide. The most recent data suggest that low doses of indapamide exert synergistic effects in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as ACE inhibitors, the effects of which are influenced by the sodium status of the organism.", 
    "424": "Background-Endocardial (EE) and myocardial capillary vascular endothelial (myocap VE) cells have been shown to modulate the contractile characteristics of myocardium in a calcium-dependent manner. We evaluated the endothelial-myocardial interaction in the rat postinfarction myocardial infarction (MI) model and the effects of captopril. Methods and Results-Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups treated for 4 weeks: (1) control; (2) infarcted controls (left anterior coronary artery ligation); (3) infarcted+captopril 2 g/L in drinking water; and (4) infarct+captopril+triton intracoronary injection. Coronary VE function was evaluated by infusion of serotonin in Langendorff preparations (n=31), and the myocardial contractile characteristics were investigated by use of isolated papillary muscles (n=44). Cardiac mRNA for endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) was measured, and its cellular location was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Serotonin-induced increase in coronary flow was decreased in infarct controls compared with controls (4.6% versus 53.4%, P<0.01) but not in the 2 infarct+captopril groups. Intracoronary triton injection decreased serotonin-induced coronary flow in the infarct+captopril+triton group. All MI groups had decreased total tension in isolated papillary muscles. EE removal by triton immersion decreased total tension in all groups except for infarct controls (3.3 versus 3.2 g/mm(2)). Cardiac ecNOS mRNA decreased in the control infarct group but remained normal in the infarct+captopril group. Conclusions-Chronic postinfarction endothelium-induced coronary vasodilatation is impaired, and both EE and myocap VE dysfunction contribute to myocardial depression. Captopril use prevents these abnormalities and the reduction of cardiac ecNOS mRNA.", 
    "425": "Background-Treatment with diuretics has been reported to increase the risk of arrhythmic death in patients with hypertension. The effect of diuretic therapy on arrhythmic death in patients with left ventricular dysfunction is unknown. Methods and Results-We conducted a retrospective analysis of 6797 patients with an ejection fraction <0.36 enrolled in the Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) to assess the relation between diuretic use at baseline and the subsequent risk of arrhythmic death. Participants receiving a diuretic at baseline were more likely to have an arrhythmic death than those not receiving a diuretic (3.1 vs 1.7 arrhythmic deaths per 100 person-years, P=0.001). On univariate analysis, diuretic use was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death (relative risk [RR] 1.85, P=0.0001). After controlling for important covariates, diuretic use remained significantly associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death (RR 1.37, P=0.009). Only non-potassium-sparing diuretic use was independently associated with arrhythmic death (RR 1.33, P=0.02). Use of a potassium-sparing diuretic, alone or in combination with a non-potassium-sparing diuretic, was not independently associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death (RR 0.90, P=0.6). Conclusions-In SOLVD, baseline use of a non-potassium-sparing diuretic was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death, whereas baseline use of a potassium-sparing diuretic was not. These data suggest that diuretic-induced electrolyte disturbances may result in fatal arrhythmias in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "426": "Background-Our objective for this study was to investigate whether nitric oxide (NO) modulates tissue respiration in the failing human myocardium. Methods and Results-Left ventricular free wall and right ventricular tissue samples were taken from 14 failing explanted human hearts at the time of transplantation. Tissue oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode in an airtight stirred bath containing Krebs solution buffered with HEPES at 37 degrees C (pH 7.4). Rate of decrease in oxygen concentration was expressed as a percentage of the baseline, and results of the highest dose are indicated. Bradykinin (10(-4) mol/L, -21+/-5%), amlodipine (10(-5) mol/L, -14+/-5%), the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat (10(-4) mol/L, -21+/-2%), and the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor thiorphan (10(-4) mol/L, -16+/-5%) all caused concentration-dependent decreases in tissue oxygen consumption. Responses to bradykinin (-2+/-6%), amlodipine (-2+/-4%), ramiprilat (-5+/-6%), and thiorphan (-4+/-7%) were significantly attenuated after NO synthase blockade with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10(-4) mol/L; all P<0.05). NO-releasing compounds S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (10(-4) mol/L, -34+/-5%) and nitroglycerin (10(-4) mol/L, -21+/-5%), also decreased tissue oxygen consumption in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the reduction in tissue oxygen consumption in response to S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (-35+/-7%) or nitroglycerin (-16+/-5%) was not significantly affected by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Conclusions-These results indicate that the modulation of oxygen consumption by both endogenous and exogenous NO is preserved in the failing human myocardium and that the inhibition of kinin degradation plays an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration.", 
    "427": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the greater inhibitory effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on urinary cAMP excretion in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats is secondary to hypertension and/or renal hemodynamic changes induced by Ang II. SHRs and WKY rats were treated chronically from conception, 6 weeks of age, or 10 weeks of age (n = 8-10) with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (100 mg/kg/day). A fourth group was not treated chronically with captopril (n = 7). At approximately 13 weeks of age, all rats were anesthetized, given a bolus of captopril (30 mg/kg), and received an intrarenal infusion of a low dose of Ang II (1 ng/min). SHRs compared with WKY rats were normotensive, mildly hypertensive, and moderately hypertensive when treated with captopril from conception, 6 weeks of age, and 10 weeks of age, respectively, whereas untreated SHRs were severely hypertensive. In SHRs, Ang II decreased urinary cAMP excretion (p <.001), and this effect was independent of duration of captopril pretreatment (p = .696). In WKY rats, Ang II did not affect urinary cAMP excretion. Low-dose Ang II caused small and similar changes in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in SHRs versus WKY rats and did not affect urine volume in either strain. We conclude that the greater effect of Ang II on urinary cAMP excretion in SHRs is not due to hypertension or to the renal hemodynamic effects of Ang II, but most likely to a greater effect of Ang II on some compartment of renal adenylyl cyclase activity in SHRs.", 
    "428": "Abnormalities of skeletal muscles are frequently observed in patients with congestive heart failure. In these patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve exercise performance. The present study was designed to assess whether skeletal muscle dysfunction develops in the early stage of cardiac overload and if so, whether such functional alterations can be prevented by ACE inhibition. Mechanical performance, cross-bridge (CB) properties, and myosin heavy chain composition were investigated in respiratory and limb skeletal muscles of rabbits with moderate cardiac hypertrophy, and after single therapy with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (PE). After constriction of the aorta, the rabbits were treated during a 10-week period with either PE (1 mg/kg/day; n = 9) or a placebo (PL; n = 15). A third group of sham-operated animals received PL (n = 10). Analyses were performed on isolated diaphragm and soleus strips. Compared with sham-operated animals (shams), peak tetanic tension in PL fell by 40% in diaphragm and 34% in soleus. There were no significant differences in peak tetanic tension and the maximum shortening velocity between PE and shams. In both muscles, the total number of CBs was significantly lower in PL than in shams, but did not differ between shams and PE. The elementary force per CB did not differ between groups. In both muscles, the myosin heavy chain composition did not differ between groups. The study demonstrated that intrinsic performance of diaphragm and soleus muscles was affected early in the development of chronic pressure overload. Single therapy with PE tended to preserve muscle strength, essentially by limiting the loss of CBs.",

Both children have had a prolonged and sustained clinical response with good physical health and normal growth patterns using captopril and indometacin as their sole treatment. No adverse effects have been noted. We recommend a trial of indometacin and captopril treatment in cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "430": "The author of this volume has studied IgA nephropathy for nearly 25 years, almost as long as primary IgA nephropathy has been recognized as a new disease. IgA nephropathy, considered to be an immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, is characterized by granular deposition of IgA (mainly IgA1) and C3 in the glomerular mesangial areas and is defined as nephropathy showing proliferative changes in the glomerular mesangial cells and increases in the mesangial matrices. Apart from being one of the most common types of chronic glomerulonephritis, it is also the most frequent case of end-stage renal disease. Since the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy is still obscure, specific treatment is not yet available. Previous approaches have included tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, prednisolone, immunosuppressants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and others. During his career, the author of this book has studied many aspects of IgA nephropathy, shedding much light on the mechanism of development and progression of this disease. He also undertook new treatments for patients and developed animal models for IgA nephropathy. The purpose of the present volume is to review the author's work on pathogenesis and treatment of the disease and to provide the most up-to-date findings on this subject, constituting a valuable source of information for nephrologists, general practitioners, residents and interns.", 
    "431": "Contrary to previous reports, recent enzymatic assays showed the predominance of chymase-like activity in rat arteries. We determined the existence and significance of such alternative pathways in rat carotid arteries by measuring contraction of arterial rings in organ baths and blood pressure in conscious rats. Hamster aorta served as a positive control for chymase. Temocapril (30 micromol/L) inhibited the contractions to angiotensin (Ang) I (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/L) except at high concentrations of Ang I (>10(-7) mol/L). Addition of chymostatin (100 micromol/L) to temocapril exerted a synergistic inhibitory effect. Hamster aorta gave similar results, except that temocapril was 30-fold less effective than in rat arteries. [Pro(11), D-Ala(12)]Ang I (10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/L), a chymase-specific substrate, provoked similar responses in rat and hamster arteries; chymostatin, but not temocapril, attenuated the responses. CV 11974 (30 micromol/L), an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist, abolished the responses to both peptides. In conscious rats, Ang I (0.03 to 30 microg/kg) and [Pro(11),D-Ala(12)]Ang I (7 to 700 microg/kg) produced similar pressor responses. Not only CV 11974 (1 mg/kg) but also temocapril (2 mg/kg) abolished Ang I-induced responses in vivo. CV 11974, but not temocapril, inhibited responses to [Pro(11), D-Ala(12)]Ang I. Our results showed the presence of the alternative pathway in rat arteries, but it did not play a major role. Arteries with the opposing characteristics of chymase responded equally to [Pro(11),D-Ala(12)]Ang I. These findings suggest that biochemical and [Pro(11),D-Ala(12)]Ang I-derived results may not reflect the functional significance of chymase.", 
    "432": "The Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rat, a genetic model of salt-induced hypertension in humans, is more likely to develop severe vascular injuries than a rat with spontaneous hypertension. We designed an experiment to scrutinize the effects of renin-angiotensin inhibition on cognitive dysfunction in the aged, normotensive DS with a passive avoidance test. Eighteen months of treatment with a very low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril (2.5 microg/mL in drinking water) or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist E4177 did not reduce blood pressure throughout the experiment, although in the low dose cilazapril group (12.5 microg/mL in drinking water), blood pressure dropped within 6 months after treatment began. The cilazapril treatments dose-dependently improved memory function in the aged, normotensive DS fed a low-salt diet compared with the untreated, control rats. This improvement was associated with significant increases in hippocampal CA1 cells and capillary densities in the CA1 regions compared with those in the untreated DS. Similarly, E4177 slightly improved the memory dysfunction observed in the aged DS. The cells in the hippocampal CA1 region were restored slightly, but the capillary densities were not influenced by the receptor antagonist. On the other hand, the ACE inhibitor and receptor antagonist both attenuated urinary protein excretions with an improvement of glomerular sclerosis. These data suggest that long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor improves memory dysfunction probably through restoration of capillary and hippocampal cells. The effects are due to the inhibition of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and probably to the enhancement of the kallikrein-kinin system.", 
    "433": "Angiotensin-(1-7) is a product of angiotensin processing that has been proposed to have vasodepressor effects, both on its own and in combination with bradykinin, which may be pathophysiologically and therapeutically important. Despite this, there has been very little examination of its effects in humans and none in heart failure patients or in other patients treated with ACE inhibitors. We therefore sought to determine the effects of angiotensin-(1-7) in patients with heart failure treated with an ACE inhibitor, as well as any interaction with the effects of bradykinin. A locally active dose of angiotensin-(1-7), alone and in combination with bradykinin, was infused into the nondominant brachial artery while forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography in 8 patients with heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors. Although bradykinin on its own caused profound vasodilation, there was no effect of angiotensin-(1 to 7) on its own or any effect of angiotensin-(1-7) on the response to bradykinin. We conclude that angiotensin-(1-7) is biologically inactive in the forearm circulation of patients with heart failure treated with an ACE inhibitor. The contrast between these findings and previously reported preclinical findings calls into question the relevance of angiotensin-(1-7) to the hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors.",

    "435": "Laser-Doppler flowmetry allowed for the characterization of medullary blood flow (MBF) over a wide range of renal arterial pressure (RAP), and was used for comparison among treatment groups. Renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) was also determined over a wide range of RAP.", 
    "436": "Enalapril or losartan was given to male 12-13-week-old SHR for 3 days (25 mg/kg per day in drinking water). Rats were anesthetized with Inactin, renal function was measured at resting levels of RAP and then RAP was varied over a range of 50-150 mmHg in 25 mmHg steps. MBF and RIHP were determined at each pressure.", 
    "437": "Resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) (mmHg +/- SE) for enalapril- and for losartan-treated SHR [114 +/- 3 (n = 18) and 124 +/- 3 (n = 20), respectively] were both significantly lower than for untreated SHR [159 +/- 5 (n = 20)]. Renal function at resting levels of MAP was not significantly different among groups. Enalapril and losartan both increased MBF by 30% at levels of RAP of 125 mmHg and over. Enalapril did not alter the relation between RAP and RIHP, but losartan shifted the RAP versus RIHP curve by approximately 40 mmHg to lower levels of RAP. Acute administration of the B2 kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 [20 microg/kg intravenous (i.v.) bolus, then 10 microg/kg per h i.v.] did not significantly alter MAP in any group. HOE 140 did not significantly alter MBF or RIHP in the untreated or losartan-treated SHR. MBF in enalapril-treated rats receiving HOE 140 was not significantly different from that of the enalapril-only group; however, the relation between RAP and RIHP was shifted to lower levels of RAP by approximately 45 mmHg.", 
    "438": "Both enalapril and losartan increase MBF in SHR, suggesting that the medullary circulation of SHR is influenced by endogenous levels of angiotensin II. The failure of enalapril to increase RIHP in parallel with MBF appears to be due to an enhanced effect of kinins.", 
    "439": "Moxonidine is a centrally acting antihypertensive. Its action is mediated by imidazoline I1 receptors located in the rostral ventro-lateral medulla (RVLM). Animal experiments show that much smaller amounts are required to reduce blood pressure (BP) when it is given intracisternally, or injected directly into the RVLM, compared to intravenous dose. Pretreatment with imidazoline I1 blockade from efaroxan abolishes the antihypertensive action of microinjection of moxonidine into the RVLM in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), while alpha2 blockade from SKF 86466 is much less effective. Microinjection of efaroxan into the RVLM prevents the fall of BP in the SHR from intravenous moxonidine. Moxonidine binds with an affinity for the imidazoline I1 receptor that is 33 times more effective than is alpha2-receptor binding. There is only a few fold preference for binding at the imidazoline I1-receptor for clonidine. Moxonidine results in a fall in adrenaline, noradrenaline and renin levels in humans, as might be expected from central inhibition of sympathetic tone. Moxonidine gives a fall of BP due to a decline in systemic vascular resistance, while the heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and pulmonary artery pressures are not affected. There is a reduction in left-ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes. There is a regression of left-ventricular hypertrophy after moxonidine was given for 6 months. Following oral administration the half-life (Tmax) is about 1 h. Moxonidine is highly bioavailable, approaching 90%. Moxonidine is largely excreted unchanged, biotransformation is unimportant. It has a T(1/2) of 2.5 h, renal insufficiency prolongs the T(1/2). However, suggesting possible retention in the central nervous system (CNS) the antihypertensive effect lasts longer than would be expected from the half-life. Moxonidine has been shown to be suitable for administration once daily. Moxonidine is an effective antihypertensive drug. In the course of its evaluation it has been compared with representatives from each important class of antihypertensive drugs, with diuretics, both alpha- and beta-blocking drugs, clonidine, calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These studies have shown that BP control is overall similar with moxonidine and these other agents. Moxonidine has a favourable side-effect profile, at least in part due to its lack of effect on central alpha2 receptors.", 
    "440": "An AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, has been reported to improve survival and quality of life in patients with congestive heart failure as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors do. Since many of the patients are normotensive, it may be a drawback if the compound decreases normal blood pressure. In this study, we investigated whether a novel AT1 receptor antagonist, TA-606, which is more potent than losartan, affects normal blood pressure and its regulatory system in comparison with losartan. TA-606 (30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) did not change normal blood pressure, whereas losartan (100 mg/kg, p.o.) tended to decrease it. Although EXP3174 (1 and 10 mg/kg, i.v.), an active metabolite of losartan, suppressed the baroreceptor-heart rate (HR) reflex, 606A (1 and 10 mg/kg, i.v.), an active metabolite of TA-606, did not affect it. Since losartan is known to affect the L-glutamate receptor which is part of the central blood pressure regulatory system, we also investigated whether 606A affects L-glutamate receptor binding. We found that 606A did not affect the binding of the L-glutamate receptor, but EXP3174 inhibited the binding with IC50 values of 13.3 microM. These findings suggest that, even having the same AT1 receptor antagonist properties as losartan and EXP3174, TA-606 and its active metabolite do not influence normal blood pressure or its regulatory system.", 
    "441": "In contrast with the expected results, the Captopril Prevention Project study has found that the relative risk of stroke was greater by 25% in patients treated with ACEI than in patients receiving the conventional diuretics +/- betablockers regimen (Hanson et al. ISH Amsterdam, June 98). This difference persisted after adjustment for the initial differences of blood pressure levels between the groups after randomisation. This does not mean that ACEI would worsen the risk of stroke when compared to a placebo, since a potent protective effect of diuretics and betablockers on the relative risk of stroke has long been demonstrated. Nonetheless, these results suggest that for a similar blood pressure lowering effect, conventional therapy is more effective than ACEI to prevent stroke. This finding, in discrepancy with the current prevailing opinion that ACEI have emerged as the most effective preventive treatment to reduce cardiovascular morbidity, is regarded as surprising by the investigators. However, a number of animal experimental data may help to envisage the complete inhibition of angiotensin II formation as a two-edged sword, because of the multiplicity of its receptors mediating different, and even opposite effects. In a series of experimental studies in mammals, the group of Fernandez has provided a bundle of observations suggesting that angiotensin II contributes to early reperfusion following acute ischemia by enabling the recruitment of pre-existing collateral vascularisation, an effect mediated via the stimulation of non-AT1 receptors (possibly AT2). Indeed, the worsening of stroke in the gerbil after incomplete ligation of the carotid by pre-treatment with ACEI had been demonstrated by these authors (J Cerebral Blood Flow Metab, 1988; 24:937), and they further show that pre-administration of losartan significantly reduced the ischemic brain damage and the mortality induced by the abrupt ligation of one carotid, but that this preventive effect of losartan was abolished if enalapril was co-administrated (J Cardiovasc Pharmacol 1994; 24:937). The first available clinical data on stroke risk with ACEI reported in the CPP study, showing a less effective prevention of stroke with ACEI than diuretics supports the hypothesis that similar mechanism may also prevail in humans, and lead us to propose to discuss the rationale for a large multicentric trial aiming to compare the protective effect of ARAT1 and ACEI on the risk of recurrence of stroke.", 
    "442": "Antihypertensive drugs are commonly prescribed for the treatment of patients with both diabetes and hypertension. However, the role of selected agents in the development of hypoglycemia remains controversial. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive agents on the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients receiving insulin or sulfonylurea therapy. A matched case-control study was conducted using Pennsylvania Medicaid data. Five control subjects, matched for sex and age, with no reported medical condition of hypoglycemia, were randomly selected for each case patient admitted for hypoglycemia in 1993, resulting in a total of 404 cases and 1375 controls. With these sample sizes, we were able to detect a difference of 10% (P < 0.05) for our primary outcome measure, hospitalization for hypoglycemia. The relative risk of hypoglycemia was estimated using an unconditional logistic regression. The risk of hypoglycemia was 5.5 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 to 7.6) in insulin versus sulfonylurea users and was not influenced by use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors overall. However, use of the ACE inhibitor enalapril was associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3) in sulfonylurea users, suggesting that analyzing the unintended side effects of a class of drugs can sometimes mask the adverse effects of individual drugs. Use of beta-blockers was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia, providing further empiric evidence that beta-blockers are an appropriate treatment for persons with concomitant diabetes and hypertension. Per capita health care costs were approximately 3 times higher in patients hospitalized for hypoglycemia compared with controls (P < 0.05). Hospitalization for hypoglycemia is expensive and may be prevented with appropriate monitoring of diabetic patients taking selected antihypertensive agents such as enalapril.", 
    "443": "Since its introduction in 1785, digitalis has been the cornerstone in the treatment of heart failure, although there during the last 20 years have been an increasing number of critical voices questioning its use in patients with sinus rhythm. In 1997 the Digitalis Investigation Group published the so far largest randomized trial on the use of digoxin in patients with heart failure (DIG-trial). All the included patients had sinus rhythm, and all received an ACE-inhibitor. Digoxin had no effect on mortality, but caused a decrease in hospitalizations. Based on the DIG-study, several minor clinical trials and two large withdrawal studies (RADIANCE and PROVED) it now seems clear that digoxin still has a role in the management of heart failure, not only in patients with atrial fibrillation, but also in patients with sinus rhythm.", 
    "444": "Chronic severe subclinical systemic hypertension was diagnosed in a 28-yr-old male western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography revealed an enlarged heart with a hypertrophied left ventricle, mitral regurgitation, and a persistent left bundle branch block. Enalapril, later combined with nifedipine, was of some value in reducing the hypertension, with partial reversal of cardiac enlargement and resolution of the bundle branch block. Two years after initiation of treatment, the gorilla developed lethargy and dyspnea. The diagnosis of heart failure was confirmed under anesthesia; the gorilla did not recover and was euthanized. Postmortem examination confirmed congestive heart failure with chronic, fibrosing cardiomyopathy similar to that in other gorillas.", 
    "445": "The antiarrhythmic efficacies of the competitive angiotensin II (AII) antagonist losartan, losartan's more potent noncompetitive AII antagonist human metabolite EXP3174 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were assessed in a canine model of recent myocardial infarction.", 
    "446": "Multiple hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects of AII may contribute to cardiac electrical instability. In the recent Losartan Heart Failure Study, Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly (ELITE), a 722-patient trial primarily designed to assess effects on renal function, an unexpected survival benefit was observed with losartan compared with captopril, with the lower mortality using losartan primarily confined to a reduction in sudden cardiac death.", 
    "447": "Intravenous losartan (1 mg/kg + 0.03 mg/kg/min), EXP3174 (0.1 mg/kg + 0.01 mg/kg/min), captopril (1 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg/h) or vehicle were infused in anesthetized dogs with recent (8.1 +/- 0.4 days) anterior myocardial infarction. Electrolytic injury of the left circumflex coronary artery to induce thrombotic occlusion and posterolateral ischemia was initiated 1 h after the start of treatment.", 
    "448": "Losartan, EXP3174 and captopril elevated plasma renin activities and comparably and significantly reduced mean arterial pressure. No significant electrocardiographic or cardiac electrophysiologic effects were noted with any treatment. Incidences of acute posterolateral ischemia-induced lethal arrhythmias were: vehicle, 7/9 (77%); losartan, 6/8 (75%); EXP3174, 2/8 (25%; p < 0.05 vs. vehicle control); captopril, 7/10 (70%). There were no among-group differences in time to onset of acute posterolateral ischemia or underlying anterior infarct size.", 
    "449": "EXP3174, but not losartan nor captopril, reduced the incidence of lethal ischemic ventricular arrhythmia in this preparation. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of EXP3174 may be due to an attenuation of deleterious effects of local cardiac AII formed during acute myocardial ischemia or, alternatively, a non-AII-related activity specific to EXP3174. These findings suggest that in humans, metabolic conversion of losartan to EXP3174 may afford antiarrhythmic protection.", 
    "450": "Treatment of rabbits with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors increases the apparent affinity of the Na+-K+ pump for Na+. To explore the mechanism, we voltage clamped myocytes from control rabbits and rabbits treated with captopril with patch pipettes containing 10 mM Na+. When pipette solutions were K+ free, pump current (Ip) for myocytes from captopril-treated rabbits was nearly identical to that for myocytes from controls. However, treatment caused a significant increase in Ip measured with pipettes containing K+. A similar difference was observed when myocytes from rabbits treated with the ANG II receptor antagonist losartan and myocytes from controls were compared. Treatment-induced differences in Ip were eliminated by in vitro exposure to ANG II or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or inclusion of the protein kinase C fragment composed of amino acids 530-558 in pipette solutions. Treatment with captopril had no effect on the voltage dependence of Ip. We conclude that ANG II regulates the pump's selectivity for intracellular Na+ at sites near the cytoplasmic surface. Protein kinase C is implicated in the messenger cascade.", 
    "451": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether administration of bradykinin reproduces the cardioprotective effects of ischemic preconditioning (PC) in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).", 
    "452": "Experimental studies suggest that activation of the bradykinin B2 receptor is an important trigger of ischemic PC. However, it is unknown whether bradykinin can precondition human myocardium against ischemia in vivo. Multicenter clinical trials have demonstrated an anti-ischemic effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which has been postulated to result from potentiation of bradykinin; however, direct evidence for an anti-ischemic action of bradykinin in patients is lacking.", 
    "453": "Thirty patients were randomized to receive a 10-min intracoronary infusion of bradykinin (2.5 microg/min) or normal saline. Ten minutes later they underwent PTCA (three 2-min balloon inflations 5 min apart).", 
    "454": "In control patients, the ST-segment shift on the intracoronary and surface electrocardiogram was significantly greater during the first inflation than during the second and third inflations, consistent with ischemic PC. In bradykinin-treated patients, the ST-segment shift during the first inflation was significantly smaller than in the control group, and there were no appreciable differences in ST-segment shift during the three inflations. Measurements of chest pain score and regional wall motion during inflation (quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography) paralleled those of ST-segment shift. Infusion of bradykinin had no hemodynamic effects and no significant adverse effects. Thus, intracoronary infusion of bradykinin before PTCA rendered the myocardium relatively resistant to subsequent ischemia, and the degree of this cardioprotective effect was comparable to that afforded by the ischemia associated with the first balloon inflation in control subjects. In a separate cohort of seven patients given the same dose of bradykinin, coronary hyperemia resolved completely within 10 min after the end of the infusion, indicating that bradykinin-induced vasodilation cannot account for the protective effects observed during the first balloon inflation.", 
    "455": "Bradykinin preconditions human myocardium against ischemia in vivo in the absence of systemic hemodynamic changes. Pretreatment with bradykinin appears to be just as effective as ischemic PC and could be used prophylactically to attenuate ischemia in selected patients undergoing PTCA.", 
    "456": "Classification methods based on linear discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning, and hierarchical agglomerative clustering are examined for their ability to separate active and inactive compounds in a diverse chemical database. Topology-based descriptions of chemical structure from the Molconn-X and ISIS programs are used in conjunction with these classification techniques to identify ACE inhibitors, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and H2 receptor antagonists. Overall, discriminant analysis misclassifies the smallest number of active compounds, while recursive partitioning yields the lowest rate of misclassification among inactives. Binary structural keys from the ISIS package are found to generally outperform the whole-molecule Molconn-X descriptors, especially for identification of inactive compounds. For all targets and classification methods, sensitivity toward active compounds is increased by making repetitive classification using training sets that contain equal numbers of actives and inactives. These balanced training sets provide an average numerical class membership score which may be used to select subsets of compounds that are enriched in actives.", 
    "457": "In diabetic patients endothelial dysfunction is reflected by an increased urinary albumine excretion, which can be reduced by ACE-inhibitors. No data are available showing a endothelial-protective effect by determining a marker reflecting endothelial cell-damage.", 
    "458": "The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) (ramipril) treatment on the progression of endothelial cell damage,--assessed by measurement of plasma-thrombomodulin (TM),--was investigated in an open, non randomized, prospective pilot study over a period of 18 months in diabetic patients. 87 patients with an urinary albumin concentration (UAC) below 100 mg/l at baseline were included. 46 patients were treated without ACEI and served as a control group, 41 patients were treated with ACEI. Participation in this study did not affect intensity in the treatment of blood glucose, blood pressure or diet. At study entry both groups were comparable with respect to duration of diabetes, diabetic complications, vascular risk factors, body mass index, medications used to treat diabetes, presence of hypertension, glycemic control, tryglycerides, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, UAC and plasma-TM. Age, blood pressure, and total cholesterol were significantly higher in the ACEI group, compared with the control group.", 
    "459": "After a follow up of 18 months a significant increase in UAC (delta UAC = 10.48 mg/l, p = 0.03) and plasma-TM (delta TM = 3.06 ng/l, p = 0.009) was observed in the control group, while in the ACEI treated group a decrease in albuminuria (delta UAC = -7.44 mg/l, p = 0.01) and plasma-TM (delta TM = -4.78 ng/l, p = 0.001) was seen. Despite a similar approach in hypertension and diabetes control in both groups, UAC and plasma-TM decreased after 18 months only in the ACEI treated group. Treatment with ACEI was the strongest predictor (p = 0.0001) indicating decrease of UAC and plasma-TM (multi regression analysis).", 
    "460": "Plasma-thrombomodulin might be a useful marker for assessing the efficacy of drugs potentially protecting the vessel wall. While the present study was a open, non randomized study, further investigation is necessary to proof the hypothesis in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.", 
    "461": "Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were tried in patients early after myocardial infarction (MI) irrespective of the severity of circulation insufficiency. Monopril was used in 23 patients in the dose 7.6 mg/day. Ednit was given to 21 patients in the dose 5.3 mg/day. Control groups included 19 and 21 patients, respectively. All the patients underwent treadmill test and echocardiography on MI day 1 and 13-14. ACE inhibitors provide better exercise tolerance and favourable course of MI even in the absence of marked manifestations of cardiac failure though left ventricular ejection changed insignificantly. They may also prevent myocardial ischemia. The difference between monopril and ednit effects was insignificant.", 
    "462": "Many different imaging modalities and techniques have been used in the past for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. The ideal accurate, non-invasive and inexpensive diagnostic test has yet to be found but there have been promising developments during the last few years. In this review we consider in detail the use of the following tests for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis; intravenous urography, B Mode ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound, renal scintigraphy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, intra-venous and intra-arterial catheter angiography, computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography. At present intra-arterial catheter angiography remains the 'gold standard' test. Magnetic resonance angiography is currently of limited availability in the United Kingdom but is the most promising new development because it is a non-invasive test which can be used to obtain both anatomical and functional information.", 
    "463": "Abnormalities of left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling and stress-corrected midwall shortening (MWS) have been described in hypertensive patients with normal ejection fraction (EF). However, whether stress-corrected MWS parallels LV diastolic filling better than EF does remains uncertain. Blood pressure, body mass index, echocardiographic LV mass and LV geometry, EF and stress-corrected MWS, LV diastolic filling (peak E- and A-wave velocities, E-wave deceleration time, and atrial filling fraction) were evaluated in 212 hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy enrolled in the Prospective Randomized Enalapril Study Evaluating Regression of Ventricular Enlargement study. LV structure, geometry, as well as LV diastolic filling, were compared between patients with reduced EF (<55%, n = 39, 18%) and those with normal EF (>55%) as well as between patients with reduced stress-corrected MWS (<89.2%, n = 31, 15%) and those with normal stress-corrected MWS (>89.2%). Patients with reduced EF had higher LV mass, eccentric LV geometry, and higher heart rate than those with normal EF, although they did not differ in age, blood pressure, or body mass index. LV filling pattern was also similar in those 2 groups. Patients with reduced stress-corrected MWS had higher atrial filling fraction, body mass index, heart rate, LV mass, and concentric geometry than those with normal stress-corrected MWS. Atrial filling fraction was negatively associated with stress-corrected MWS, but not with EF in multivariate models, independently of age, gender, heart rate, and body mass index. Thus, in hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy, abnormal LV diastolic filling is more closely related to impaired myocardial contractility than to LV chamber EF.", 
    "464": "In this study, the vascular responses of diabetic rat femoral arteries to epinephrine were investigated. The effects of lisinopril (ACE inhibitor) on vascular epinephrine sensitivity were also tested in a different group. This study was carried out in sodium pentobarbital-anesthetized rats 8 weeks after induction of diabetes with streptozotocin. After extensive dissection of the femoral arteries with adventitial stripping, epinephrine and chlorpromazine were applied to the vascular wall, and their vascular effects were compared in streptozotocin-diabetic (STZ-D), lisinopril-administered streptozotocin-diabetic (LASTZ-D), lisinopril-administered nondiabetic (LAND), and non-diabetic (ND) groups. Vasoconstriction was induced by epinephrine in all groups in a dose-response fashion. There were statistically significant differences in maximum percent constriction between STZ-D and LASTZ-D groups. There was also a significant increase in sensitivity to epinephrine in the STZ-D group. The vasoconstriction induced by epinephrine was relieved by chlorpromazine in all groups. Results suggest that there are important functional abnormalities in the responses of vessels to epinephrine in diabetics, and that the attenuation of vasoconstriction by ACE inhibitors may have beneficial effects in microsurgical procedures performed on diabetic patients. Topically-applied chlorpromazine appears to be effective in relieving vasospasm due to epinephrine, and may be a useful tool to resolve perioperative vascular spasm in microsurgical procedures for diabetic and non-diabetic patients.", 
    "465": "The purpose of this study was to test whether a short-course treatment with ACE inhibitors may restore endothelium-dependent and/or -independent vasodilation in the femoral artery of microalbuminuric patients with type 1 diabetes and normal arterial pressure.",

The patients were enrolled in a double-blind cross-over study with a 1-week trial of either placebo, captopril (25 mg t.i.d.), or enalapril (10 mg/day) in randomized order to ascertain whether short-term ACE inhibition obtained with (captopril) or without (enalapril) a sulfhydryl donor molecule ameliorates vessel wall function. Endothelium-mediated flow-dependent vasodilation and endothelium-independent vasodilation were evaluated in the right common femoral artery by echo Doppler.",

Captopril (28.4+/-3.5 vs. 17.1+/-3.5% per 5 min during placebo, P < 0.05) but not enalapril (20.1+/-3.0 vs. 31.7+/-2.8% per 5 min, P < 0.05 for enalapril versus control group B, and NS for captopril vs. control group B) ameliorated endothelium-independent vasodilation in type 1 diabetic patients.", 
    "468": "ACE inhibition improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the femoral artery of normotensive microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients. Captopril also ameliorates endothelium-independent vasodilation, possibly through its sulfhydryl donor properties. These results may be of pathophysiological relevance to prevent cardiovascular complications in these patients.", 
    "469": "The ability of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to lower blood pressure may in part be due to the formation of vasodilatory prostaglandins. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with aspirin may therefore theoretically attenuate the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. This trial studied the interaction between aspirin (ASA) and enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and ASA and losartan, an angiotensin subtype 1 receptor antagonist. Seventeen essential hypertensive patients were studied, maintained on a stable dose of either enalapril (n = 7) or losartan (n = 10) monotherapy for > or =12 weeks before and throughout the study. Each patient received a 2-week course of placebo, 81 mg/day ASA, and 325 mg/day ASA, each treatment separated by a 2-week washout period. Blood pressure (BP) and serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) samples were obtained at the end of each treatment period. Placebo was compared with each dose of ASA for each group. In both the enalapril and losartan groups, mean, systolic, and diastolic BP were unchanged with the addition of ASA. Concentrations of TXB2 were suppressed to <10% in both groups with ASA. This study demonstrates that 81 to 325 mg/day ASA exerts no significant effect on BP in essential hypertensives taking enalapril or losartan.", 
    "470": "Pneumonia is a major direct cause of death in the elderly. Although aspiration based on a reduced cough reflex is one of the causes of pneumonia in the elderly, there are few studies of angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), which are antihypertensive drugs that induce cough, as a factor influencing the incidence of pneumonia in institutionalized elderly subjects. To assess the effect of ACE inhibitors and dihydropiridine calcium-channel blockers on the incidence of pneumonia, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study. Cases were 55 pneumonia patients aged > or = 65 years during a 1-year period. The controls were elderly subjects, frequency matched to the cases by age and gender (n = 220). Data were collected on known risk factors and on medication for hypertension, consisting of ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, and nonantihypertensive medication. The significance of differences in risk factors was analyzed using univariate and multivariate comparisons of cases and controls. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the relative risk estimates for pneumonia were 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.97) and 1.84 (95% CI, 0.89-3.78) for ACE inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers, respectively, relative to nonantihypertensive medication. The preventive effect of ACE inhibitors on pneumonia was apparent in long-acting ACE inhibitor users (0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.88). We conclude that ACE inhibitor use is an independent factor reducing risk of pneumonia among elderly inpatients.", 
    "471": "Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recently it has been suggested that the amino acid homocysteine contributes to this process. This study evaluates whether elevated plasma levels of homocysteine in hypertensive patients are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. Fifty hypertensive patients with a documented history of cerebral or cardiac events were age and gender matched to 50 hypertensive patients with no evidence of any cerebral or cardiac event. Demographic details, duration of hypertension, presence of other risk factors, and use of antihypertensive medications were recorded for each patient. Plasma levels of homocysteine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography technology. The two groups had similar demographic parameters, with a mean age of 64.6 +/- 9.4 years. Patients with cardiovascular events were more likely to be past smokers and to have been treated with calcium antagonists, aspirin, and nitrates. Homocysteine levels were 12.1 +/- 5.8 micromol/L in those with documented cardiovascular disease and 11.1 +/- 4.7 micromol/L in those without (P = NS). Levels of plasma homocysteine were higher in those with hypercholesterolemia (P = .03) and in smokers, and tended to be lower in those who used beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, and nitrates. Thus, hyperhomocysteinemia is not a feature of hypertensive patients with atherothrombotic events and there is no support for additive or synergistic effects between these two independent risk factors.", 
    "472": "Recently, we found that amlodipine can release nitric oxide (NO) from canine coronary microvessels, which raises the question of whether amlodipine can also promote coronary NO production in failing human hearts. The goal of this study was to define the effect of amlodipine on NO production in failing human hearts and to determine the role of kinins in the control of NO production induced by amlodipine. Six explanted human hearts with end-stage heart failure were obtained immediately at transplant surgery. Coronary microvessels were isolated as previously described, and nitrite, the stable metabolite of NO in aqueous solution, was measured using the Griess Reaction. Amlodipine (10(-10) to 10(-5) mol/L) significantly increased nitrite production in coronary microvessels in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in nitrite in response to the highest dose of amlodipine (79%) was similar in magnitude to either that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramiprilat (74%) or the neutral endopeptidase inhibitors phosphoramidon (61%) and thiorphan (72%). Interestingly, the increase in nitrite production induced by amlodipine was entirely abolished by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and also HOE-140 (a bradykinin-2 antagonist) and dichloroisocoumarin (a serine protease inhibitor that blocks kallikrein activity). These results indicate that amlodipine can promote coronary NO production in failing human hearts and that this effect is dependent on a kinin-mediated mechanism.", 
    "473": "It is known that angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts an antifibrinolytic effect by stimulating synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a specific inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The aim of this study was to compare the antithrombotic potency of imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, in a model of arterial thrombosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Oral treatment with 5 mg/kg imidapril 1 h before induction of thrombosis resulted in a significant reduction in thrombus weight, whereas candesartan did not affect thrombus weight under the same treatment conditions. Candesartan lowered blood pressure to the same degree as in the imidapril-treated rats. Imidapril not only reduce the serum and aortic ACE activities, but also reduced aortic PAI-1 protein levels, while candesartan had no effect on theses. These results suggest that imidapril, but not the AT1 receptor antagonist, candesartan, enhances fibrinolysis via a reduction of aortic PAI-1 levels by inhibiting ACE and prevents thrombus formation in SHRs.", 
    "474": "Recombinant human alpha s1-casein expressed in Escherichia coli was purified and digested with trypsin in an attempt to find peptides with angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Three novel ACE inhibitory peptides, A-II, B-II and C, were isolated and their amino acid sequences identified as Tyr-Pro-Glu-Arg (residues 8-11), Tyr-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Ile-Met-Gln-Tyr (residues 136-143) and Asn-Asn-Val-Met-Leu-Gln-Trp (residues 164-170) respectively. ACE inhibitory activities were measured for the corresponding synthetic peptides, and the ACE IC50 (the amount of peptide causing 50% inhibition of ACE activity) values of A-II, B-II and C estimated to be 132.5, 24.8 and 41.0 mumol/l respectively. Peptides A-II and C were resistant to further digestion by pepsin, whereas peptide B-II was hydrolysed. All three peptides were resistant to digestion by chymotrypsin. These ACE inhibitory peptides may prove useful for oral administration in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "475": "Hypertension control and management of concomitant pathophysiologic conditions may require use of multiple drugs. However, most studies in hypertensive disease have focused on monotherapy. Therefore, our knowledge of combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension is largely extrapolated from these monotherapy studies. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonist combinations should be particularly efficacious in reducing hypertensive target organ disease. Both of these drug classes have been shown to reduce complications of hypertensive heart disease and renal disease progression. With regard to hypertensive vascular disease, both ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists have documented benefits. However, their use together in left ventricular hypertrophy and in patients with coronary heart disease, although promising, must be proved through carefully designed, prospective, randomized trials.", 
    "476": "Effective control of blood pressure is important in slowing renal disease progression in diabetic nephropathy. However, blood pressure is often difficult to control with monotherapy, especially in this patient population in whom three medications are sometimes required to attain goal blood pressures of less than 130/85 mm. Further, physicians are often reluctant to increase the dose or add another agent to an existing regimen. The advent of low-dose, fixed-dose combination therapy allows physicians the ability to prescribe two drugs in one pill and, hence, to improve compliance. In fact, the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) recommends adding a second antihypertensive agent as an option if goal blood pressure is not achieved with a single agent. The combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and calcium antagonist may confer additive antihypertensive benefit, and may even improve the side-effect profile. This paper reviews the importance of aggressive blood pressure control in diabetic patients and the clinical trials supporting the use of combination ACE inhibitor/calcium antagonist therapy in the diabetic patient population.", 
    "477": "Antihypertensive monotherapy, although commonly used, does not address the multifactorial nature of hypertension as a disease with many pathways. Using more than one drug makes more therapeutic sense because combination agents cover more than one pathway, yet the use of drugs in tandem is typically relegated to more problematic patients later in therapy. Many patients with hypertension are not controlled, because the monotherapeutic agent is used at its highest dose, resulting in side effects that lead to noncompliance. As opposed to fixed-dose combinations that merge two drugs at their highest doses, low-dose combination therapy provides more novel coverage of two or more metabolic pathways that contribute to hypertension. Their once-daily dosing encourages compliance. In addition, because the two drugs are combined at low doses, the probability of side effects is decreased and efficacy is often enhanced. The use of low-dose combination antihypertensive agents is a good contemporary strategy for first-line therapy in that patients can take advantage of their cardiovascular benefits and the control these agents offer early in therapy.", 
    "478": "We examined the antioxidant effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+)-induced hydroxyl radical (*OH) formation in extracellular fluid of rat striatum. Rats were anesthetized and sodium salicylate in Ringer's solution (0.5 nmol microl(-1) min(-1) was infused through a microdialysis probe to detect the generation of *OH, as reflected by the non-enzymatic formation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) in the striatum. MPP+ clearly produced an increase in *OH formation in a concentration-dependent manner. When imidaprilat was infused in MPP+ -pre-treated animals, the formation of dopamine and 2,3-DHBA significantly decreased, as compared with that in the MPP+ -only-treated group. We compared the ability of two non-SH-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (imidaprilat and enalaprilat) with an SH-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) to scavenge *OH. All three angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were able to scavenge *OH generated by the action of MPP+. However, the changes produced by captopril and enalaprilat were not significant. When dopamine was administered to the MPP+ -pre-treatment group, a marked elevation was observed, showing a positive linear correlation between dopamine and *OH formation (2,3-DHBA) in the dialysate. Moreover, when iron (II) was administered to the MPP+ -pre-treatment group, the same results were obtained: a positive linear correlation (R2 = 0.989) between the release of dopamine and 2,3-DHBA (R2 = 0.989) in the dialysate. When corresponding experiments were performed with imidaprilat-pre-treated animals, the level of 2,3-DHBA decreased. These results suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may protect against MPP+ -induced *OH formation in the rat striatum.", 
    "479": "We investigated the effects of candesartan (an angiotensin II antagonist) alone, enalapril alone, and their combination on exercise tolerance, ventricular function, quality of life (QOL), neurohormone levels, and tolerability in congestive heart failure (CHF).",

There were no differences among groups with regard to 6MWD, NYHA-FC, or QOL. EF increased (P=NS) more with candesartan-plus-enalapril therapy (0.025+/-0.004) than with candesartan alone (0.015+/-0.004) or enalapril alone(0.015+/-0.005). End-diastolic (EDV) and end-systolic (ESV) volumes increased less with combination therapy (EDV 8+/-4 mL; ESV 1+/-4 mL; P<0.01) than with candesartan alone (EDV 27+/-4 mL; ESV 18+/-3 mL) or enalapril alone (EDV 23+/-7 mL; ESV 14+/-6 mL).

    "483": "The aim of the study was to show whether the ACE inhibitor captopril is able to protect the heart against the deleterious effect of passive cigarette smoking on left ventricular mitochondria. Four groups of rabbits were investigated: control (C), passive smoking of three cigarettes twice daily/30 minutes (S), control + captopril (7.5 mg/kg body weight twice daily) (Cap), and smoking + captopril (SCap) as in group 2 and 3. Three weeks lasting passive smoking impaired oxidative phosphorylation, diminished cytochrome oxidase activity and increased the mitochondrial F1-ATPase protein concentration. Moreover, the level of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and coenzyme Q9 were decreased. Simultaneous treatment with captopril prevented partly the decrease of CoQ10 level, deterioration of oxidative phosphorylation, diminution of cytochrome oxidase activity and enhancement of F1-ATPase level. We conclude that captopril protected the myocardium against the harmful effect of passive smoking in rabbits.", 
    "484": "Through vasorelaxation, nitroglycerin is considered to reduce arterial wave reflection and to cause a more pronounced decrease in systolic pressure in the aorta (AoSAP) than in the radial artery (RaSAP). Our aim was to study how radial and aortic pulse wave configurations and the gradient (RaSAP-AoSAP) were affected by nitroglycerin and by prostacyclin, and how these changes correlated to stroke volume, vascular resistance/impedance, and wave reflection. Prostacyclin has not been studied in this context and was chosen because, in contrast to nitroglycerin, it does not reduce stroke volume and reduces afterload by arteriolar dilation. In 18 patients (53-81 yr old; heavily premedicated before coronary artery surgery), blood pressure was measured in both the radial artery and the ascending aorta (tipmanometry), and cardiac output was measured by thermodilution. Mean arterial pressure was reduced stepwise with each drug (mean total decrease 10-12 mm Hg). The initial RaSAP-AoSAP gradient (6 mm Hg) was increased 10 mm Hg by nitroglycerin and was not affected by prostacyclin. The nitroglycerin-induced increase in systolic gradient RaSAP-AoSAP correlated to decreases in stroke volume index, mean arterial pressure, and arterial elastance, but not to decrease in pulse wave augmentation. Thus, decreases in stroke volume index, not wave reflection, seem to be the main reason for an increased RaSAP-AoSAP when nitroglycerin is used in the elderly, hypertensive patient.",

    "486": "The 'proof of concept' of beta-blockade for heart failure (i.e. that the pharmacologic actions of beta-blockers are beneficial) is now firmly established, as the treatment of heart failure has progressed from using positive inotropic stimulation, via drugs with no direct effect on cardiac function, to beta-blockers with negative intropic effects. This review addresses some remaining issues regarding beta-blockade in heart failure. The mechanism of action of beta-blockers in heart failure is more likely to be improved intrinsic cardiac myocyte function and prevention or reversal of remodeling, than restoration of beta-adrenergic signal transduction. The role of the differentiating characteristics of beta-blockers is not clear at this time, and there is no compelling evidence to select one agent over another on the basis of individual drug properties. Recent reports suggest that beta-blockers reduce the combined risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalizations by about 30-35%. These results are heavily influenced by experience with carvedilol, but other agents tested include metoprolol, bucindolol, bisoprolol, and nebivolol. Responsiveness to beta-blockers is not related to patients' age, sex, or race, or to the etiology or severity of heart failure. Beta-blockers are currently recommended as adjunctive treatment in patients who remain mildly to moderately symptomatic while receiving added digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Existing gaps in our knowledge must be filled in order to achieve optimal clinical application of beta-blockers. Ongoing studies will provide much of the information required. The role of beta-blockers will probably expand as we improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure, and especially of the remodeling process.",

Since that time, they have been proven to be a powerful tool in the treatment of symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In this article we will summarize the results from clinical trials using ACE inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure and after myocardial infarction. We will discuss some of the mechanisms postulated to account for the beneficial effects associated with ACE inhibitor treatment. Finally, we will highlight some recent controversies in the use of ACE inhibitors.",

Although the fixed combination preparations of thiazide and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor are gaining wide acceptance in clinical practice, data on the basic pharmacology of the combinations are relatively limited. The long-term structural and functional effects of a fixed low dose (0.24 + 0.76 mg/kg per day) combination of indapamide + perindopril (I + P,S5590) is spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were examined in the present study. 2. Male SHR (10-12 weeks) were treated with I + P or vehicle for 8 weeks. The blood pressure and heart rate were monitored by weekly measurements. At the end of the treatment period, left ventricular, aortic and intramyocardial coronary arteriole structures were assessed. Contractile and relaxant properties of mesenteric arteries were determined by wire-myography. 3. Indapamide + perindopril combination caused a significant lowering of both systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressures. Left ventricle plus septum:bodyweight ratio (P < 0.001), aortic medial cross-sectional area (P < 0.05) and media:lumen ratios (P < 0.005) were all significantly reduced by I + P treatment. In contrast, the effect of I + P on intramyocardial coronary vascular structure did not reach statistical significance. There was some improvement in endothelium-independent vasorelaxation of mesenteric vessels but contractile responses to noradrenaline and calcium were unaffected by treatment. 4. In summary, a low dose I + P combination treatment of SHR partly normalizes both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Cardiac and larger vessel hypertrophy was reversed but intramyocardial coronary arteriole structure was not as readily regressed by the end of the study.",

The influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is investigated in enalapril on renal function in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, an animal model of spontaneously non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM). 2. Enalapril (5 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered once daily by gastric gavage to 22-week-old male OLETF rats for 32 weeks. Blood pressure, albuminuria, creatinine clearance, plasma glucose, serum insulin and lipids were determined before and during the treatment. Renal haemodynamics was examined at the end of the treatment. 3. Enalapril lowered blood pressure mildly but significantly. In the vehicle-treated rats, urinary albumin excretion increased from 0.75 +/- 0.16 mg/mg creatinine (Cr) to 8.65 +/- 0.78 mg/mg Cr. Enalapril significantly blunted the development of albuminuria from 0.66 +/- 0.12 mg/mg Cr to 5.19 +/- 0.67 mg/mg Cr (P < 0.008) without significant influence on creatinine clearances. Enalapril also significantly blunted the rise in serum cholesterol and triglyceride prior to the development of massive albuminuria. Enalapril did not affect bodyweight, plasma glucose or insulin levels. Renal haemodynamics assessed by inulin and p-aminohippuric acid clearances were similar in both groups at the end of the treatment. 4. These results reconfirmed that the ACE inhibitor has protective effects on nephropathy in NIDDM. Massive albuminuria was preceded by increase in serum lipids in OLETF rats, which supports the view that hyperlipidaemia exacerbates glomerular injury in chronic renal disease. Enalapril attenuated the rise in serum lipids, suggesting that the beneficial effects of the compound on renal injury in OLETF rats might also be mediated through the action of affecting serum lipids.",

The fixed low-dose combination of perindopril 2mg with indapamide 0.625mg combines an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a non-thiazide diuretic. Coadministration of perindopril and indapamide did not have any clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetic profile of either agent in healthy volunteers. In experimental models of hypertension, perindopril/indapamide restored endothelial function, improved microvascular density, reduced left ventricular and aortic hypertrophy, and reversed renal end-organ damage. Once daily oral perindopril 2mg/indapamide 0.625mg normalised blood pressure (BP) in 83.6% of elderly patients with essential hypertension (diastolic BP was reduced to < or =90mm Hg) and 81.7% of those with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP was reduced to <160mm Hg) after approximately 1 year of treatment. BP normalisation was sustained in 79.8% of patients throughout the study. Fixed low-dose perindopril/indapamide had a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo in clinical trials; most adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. Coadministration of the 2 agents reduced the incidence of hypokalaemia seen with indapamide alone.",

This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35 percent lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10 percent of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001).

    "494": "Although captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, has been shown to exert a beneficial effect on cardiac function in heart failure, its effect on the status of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport in the failing heart has not been examined previously. In order to determine whether captopril has a protective action on cardiac function, as well as cardiac SR Ca(2+)-pump activity and gene expression, a rat model of heart failure due to myocardial infarction was employed in this study. Sham operated and infarcted rats were given captopril (2 g/l) in drinking water; this treatment was started at either 3 or 21 days and was carried out until 8 weeks after the surgery. The untreated animals with myocardial infarction showed increased heart weight and elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure, reduced rates of pressure development and pressure fall, as well as depressed SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activities in comparison with the sham control group. These hemodynamic and biochemical changes in the failing hearts were prevented by treatment of the infarcted animals with captopril. Likewise, the observed reductions in the SR Ca(2+) pump and phospholamban protein contents, as well as in the mRNA levels for SR Ca(2+) pump ATPase and phospholamban, in the failing heart were attenuated by captopril treatment. These results suggest that heart failure is associated with a defect in the SR Ca(2+) handling and a depression in the gene expression of SR proteins; the beneficial effect of captopril in heart failure may be due to its ability to prevent remodeling of the cardiac SR membrane.",

Cardiovascular mortality is more common in persons with depression, and depression following a myocardial infarction is associated with significantly poorer cardiac outcome. Safe and effective simultaneous treatment of depression and cardiovascular illness can be difficult because of the interplay between these conditions.

We also review the cardiovascular effects of antidepressant treatments and the mood-altering effects of common cardiovascular medications.

Group I (n = 10) was the reference group; group II was composed of nine patients with coronary artery disease; and group III of seven patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Forearm blood flow was measured with plethysmography. Acetylcholine and bradykinin were administered in a random order in the brachial artery at infusion rates of 40 and 80 microg/min and 10, 30, 100 pmol/min, respectively. Then quinaprilat was infused alone at the rate of 50 microg/min and then coinfused with acetylcholine and bradykinin. Five of the reference subjects were pretreated with acetylsalicylate. Acetylcholine and bradykinin increased forearm blood flow in a dose-dependent manner in the three groups. However, the vasodilator responses to both agents were significantly lower in the two groups of patients than in the reference group. Quinaprilat significantly enhanced the vasodilator response to acetylcholine only in subjects of the reference group, whereas it enhanced the vasodilator response to each dose of bradykinin, both in subjects of the reference group and in patients. Pretreatment with aspirin did not change the vasodilator responses in any group. In healthy persons, quinaprilat had no effect on its own on forearm blood flow but enhanced the response to bradykinin and even acetylcholine. In patients with coronary disease, short-term administration of quinaprilat was able to improve the impaired response to bradykinin. The response to acetylcholine, however, could not be significantly enhanced in contrast to that in healthy subjects.",

Attenuation of neurohumoral activation with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers has proven beneficial in congestive heart failure. Because ACE inhibition is a recommended treatment for heart failure, this study was designed to test the effects on neurohumoral activation, hemodynamics, and left ventricular (LV) volume of the combination of an ACE inhibitor (delapril) with a DA2-dopaminergic receptor/alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist (CHF-1024) or a beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist (metoprolol) after a moderate to large myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. MI was induced by left coronary artery ligation in 134 rats, and six were not operated on. After 2 months, the animals with ECG evidence of MI were treated for 1 more month with CHF- 1024, 0.33 mg/kg/day or with metoprolol (10 mg/kg/day), delivered through implanted osmotic minipumps, in addition to delapril (6 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water. Daily urinary excretion of norepinephrine (NE) and circulating concentration were measured. Hemodynamic variables were measured, and three-dimensional morphometric analysis was done on the diastole-arrested hearts to quantify infarct size and LV geometry. In conscious animals, delapril alone or with CHF-1024 or metropolol did not modify heart rate or systolic blood pressure. Both combination treatments, however, significantly reduced heart rate in anesthetized animals compared with the group receiving vehicle. Infarct size was not different between treatments, averaging 20-22% of LV volume. The threefold increase of LV chamber volume in infarcted rats was significantly attenuated by delapril alone or with CHF-1024 or metoprolol (-37 to -44%, p<0.05). Treatment with a combination of the ACEi and CHF-1024 tended to normalize the shape of the LV cavity. Urinary NE excretion was unaffected by delapril alone but was reduced by the addition of CHF-1024 or metoprolol. In conclusion, 1 month of treatment with doses of delapril having no hemodynamic effect, reduced LV volume in a model of chronic heart failure. When CHF-1024 or metoprolol was given with delapril, sympathetic activation decreased with no unwanted effects, such as excessive hypotension.", 
    "498": "Heart failure has become the most widely studied syndrome in cardiology over the recent years. Despite the encouraging achievements by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the mortality of patients with chronic heart failure remains high. There are several factors which can potentially be responsible for the fact that about 80% of patients with a failing heart defy protection by ACE inhibitors: different activation of tissue and systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in a particular heart disease and the distinct ability of various ACE inhibitors to block cardiac ACE, alternative pathways for angiotensin II formation (chymase), genetic polymorphism of the RAS system and the complexity of neuroendocrine activation. Moreover, chronic heart failure can provoke disturbances in the reactivity of peripheral vessels and metabolism of striated muscles. These factors may then potentiate the vicious circle of heart failure. New therapeutic approaches, which could further reduce the mortality in patients with heart failure involve angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and blockers of the endothelin receptor. A number of questions associated with functions of the RAS still remain open and their solution could be of substantial benefit for patients with a failing heart.", 
    "499": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been identified recently in elasmobranch fish, and the structure of angiotensin II (ANG II) is unusual ([Asp(1),Pro(3),Ile(5)]-ANG II) compared to other vertebrates. Receptors for ANG II have been identified in blood vessels and in a variety of osmoregulatory tissues including the gill, kidney and rectal gland. In addition, there is considerable binding to the interrenal gland and the stimulation of 1alpha-hydroxycorticosterone production in vitro suggests a physiological role in corticosteroidogenesis. ANG II is a potent vasoconstrictor and this effect does not appear to be mediated by sympathetic activation or catecholamine release. Although the RAS may not be involved in maintaining basal blood pressure, it may be important in situations in which blood pressure is reduced. Understanding of the role of ANG II as an osmoregulatory hormone is only just emerging with putative roles in the control of gill, rectal gland and perhaps, drinking. In addition, the stimulation of corticosteroid secretion may provide another means of controlling osmoregulation. J. Exp. Zool. 284:526-534, 1999.",

In the present study, however, we examined various antioxidant defenses in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients either treated with enalapril (10 mg/d) for at least 6 months (+ACEi; n = 11) or untreated (-ACEi; n = 11). The relationship between antioxidant status and HD was investigated by determining oxidative stress markers and antioxidant defenses in a group of chronic HD patients (n = 33) and a group of age-matched controls (n = 29). The effect of a single HD session on those parameters was also evaluated. Before an HD session (pre-HD), HD patients had significantly lower levels of red blood cell (RBC) glutathione (GSH), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity (RBC-Se-GPx), plasma ubiquinol-10, and alpha-tocopherol than controls. In a randomly selected group of patients (n = 19), a single HD session caused an additional decrease in RBC-GSH and plasma ubiquinol-10 levels. Plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were significantly greater in pre-HD patients than controls. Post-HD plasma TBARS levels were similar to control values. The cohort of +ACEi HD patients had greater pre-HD RBC-GSH content, RBC-Se-GPx activity, and plasma beta-carotene concentrations than -ACEi patients (RBC-GSH: +ACEi, 3.1 +/- 0.9 micromol/mL packed RBCs [PRBCs]; -ACEi, 1.2 +/- 0.3 micromol/mL PRBCs [P < 0.05 v +ACEi]; RBC-Se-GPx: +ACEi, 5.8 +/- 0.7 U/mL PRBCs; -ACEi, 4.3 +/- 0.2 U/mL PRBCs [P < 0.05 v +ACEi]; plasma beta-carotene: +ACEi, 0.54 +/- 0.16 micromol/L plasma; -ACEi, 0.19 +/- 0.05 micromol/L plasma [P < 0.05 v +ACEi]). Results show profound alterations in the circulating antioxidant systems of chronic HD patients and that additional oxidative stress occurs during the HD procedure.

This finding would suggest humoral rather than mechanical control of myocyte growth. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of nonantihypertensive doses of ACE inhibitor on myocardial hypertrophy and necrosis in hypertensive rats. Renovascular hypertension (RHT) was induced in four-week-old Wistar rats. Twenty-eight animals were treated for four weeks with three doses of ramipril (0.01, 0.1 or 1. 0 mg/kg/day, which are unable to lower blood pressure. Fourteen animals were not treated (RHT group). A sham operated, age/sex-matched group was used as control (n = 10).

There was a significant correlation between systolic blood pressure and left ventricular to body weight ratio in both sets of animals: untreated plus controls and ramipril-treated rats. ACE inhibition prevented myocyte and perivascular necrosis and fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that myocardial hypertrophy in rats with renovascular hypertension is directly related to arterial pressure, and that this relationship is not affected by nonantihypertensive doses of ACE inhibitor.

The relative reactivities of the different thiols with both oxidants were inversely related to the pK of the thiol group, such that at pH 7.4, penicillamine was the most reactive.

For hydrogen peroxide, the calculated rate constants for the reaction with the thiolate anion all fell within the range 18-26 M(-1) s(-1).

Likewise, the level to which blood pressure is reduced is not restricted to the definition of high blood pressure but instead depends on the underlying disease. Diabetes and renal insufficiency, for example, require blood pressure goals below those that are traditionally defined. In the absence of contraindications, beta-blockers and diuretics are still recommended as first-line agents for treatment of uncomplicated hypertension. Calcium channel antagonists also may reduce mortality. In patients with diabetes, ACE inhibitors are effective first-line agents in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients who are hypertensive or have microalbuminuria. ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in patients with nondiabetic renal insufficiency as well. Calcium channel antagonists may have some effect in retarding progression of diabetic nephropathy although a recent trial found a higher incidence of death as a secondary endpoint in hypertensive diabetic patients who were treated with calcium channel antagonists. Beta-blockers seem to be safe and well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate intermittent claudication, although patients with rest pain or limb ischemia have not been studied. Beta-blockers should not be used in patients with asthma. Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists are the preferred treatment of hypertension in patients with Raynaud's but should be avoided in patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. NSAIDs, particularly piroxicam and indomethacin, raise mean blood pressure by approximately 5 mm Hg, enough to consider a change of either NSAID or antihypertensive to one that is not as affected by NSAIDs. Cyclosporine A can induce hypertension by its vasoconstrictive effects, particularly on the kidney. Calcium channel antagonists may antagonize this vasoconstriction while allowing the clinician to reduce the dose of cyclosporine A required to achieve its immunosuppressive effect.",

The graphite paste is impregnated with a 10(-3) mol/L 2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammoniopropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (as chloride salt) solution. The potentiometric, enantioselective membrane electrode can be used reliably for enantiopurity tests of S-perindopril using a chronopotentiometric (zero current) technique, in the 10(-5)-10(-2) mol/L concentration range (detection limit 5 x 10(-6) mol/L), with an average recovery of 99.58% (RSD = 0.33%). The enantioselectivity was determined over R-perindopril and D-proline. The response characteristics of the enantioselective, potentiometric membrane electrode were also determined for R-perindopril. It was shown that L-proline is the main interfering compound. The surface of the electrode can be regenerated simply by polishing, obtaining a fresh surface ready to be used in a new assay.", 
    "523": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used extensively in the management of hypertension and related cardiovascular conditions. However, this treatment approach is limited by lack of specificity and continued production of angiotensin II by other routes. Antagonism of the angiotensin II receptor offers the possibility of improved control of hypertension by providing a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition without bradykinin-related effects. Eprosartan is the only nonbiphenyl, nontetrazole competitive angiotensin II receptor antagonist clinically available and is highly selective for the AT1 receptor subtype. In clinical trials, eprosartan has been shown to lower blood pressure effectively in a once-daily regimen in hypertensive patients. In the recommended dose range of 600 to 1200 mg once daily, eprosartan is effective in patients with all grades of hypertension irrespective of age, sex, or race. Furthermore, the tolerability profile of eprosartan is comparable to that of placebo, and there are no known clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. A number of large-scale clinical studies are currently underway or planned to determine which of the increasing number of AT1 receptor antagonists may reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in different groups of hypertensive patients. Meanwhile, current evidence suggests that the AT1 receptor antagonists represent a significant new approach to cardiovascular therapy and merit a fuller assessment in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.",

Bolus intravenous injections of dfAng II (30-1200 pmol kg-1) elicited dose-dependent increases in plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations, caudal artery pressure (PCA), and systemic vascular resistance (RS), and a decrease in cardiac output (Q). Similar injections of Ang II in dogfish pre-treated with the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (4 mg kg-1) also elicited dose-dependent increases in plasma catecholamine levels yet the cardiovascular effects were abolished. Dogfish treated with yohimbine were hypotensive and had elevated levels of plasma Ang II and catecholamines. Intravenous injection of the smooth muscle relaxant papaverine (10 mg kg-1) elicited a transient decrease in PCA and RS, and increases in plasma Ang II and catecholamine levels. In dogfish first treated with lisinopril (10(-4) mol kg-1), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, papaverine treatment caused a more prolonged and greater decrease in PCA and RS, an attenuated increase in plasma catecholamines, and no change in plasma Ang II. By itself, lisinopril treatment had little effect on PCA, and no effect on RS, plasma Ang II or catecholamines. In yohimbine-treated dogfish, papaverine treatment elicited marked decreases in PCA, RS, and Q, and increases in plasma Ang II and catecholamines. Among the three papaverine treatments, there was a positive linear relationship between plasma Ang II and catecholamine concentrations, and the cardiovascular and hormonal changes were most pronounced in the yohimbine + papaverine treatment. Therefore, under resting normotensive conditions, while Ang II does not appear to be involved in cardiovascular control, catecholamines play an important role. However, during a hypotensive stress elicited by vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Ang II indirectly contributes to cardiovascular control by dose-dependently stimulating catecholamine release.",

Left ventricular end-diastolic volume determined by echocardiography was obtained on day 1 and day 14. Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to assess the associations of early left ventricular dilatation with heart rate variability adjusted for clinical variables. Higher LF and TP were significantly associated with early left ventricular dilatation after adjustment for age, sex, site of myocardial infarction, acute revasucularization, peak creatine kinase level, history of hypertension, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Higher LF and TP preceded early left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction.",

From 1985 to 1993, there were 3006 coronary deaths and 6450 nonfatal major coronary events. Rates of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction declined, but there was an increase in hospital admissions for prolonged chest pain. Reductions in cigarette smoking, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and increased use of aspirin can fully explain the 3.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4, 4.2) average annual reduction in rates of major coronary events for men and the 4.1% (95% CI 2.7, 5.5) reduction for women. In contrast, increased use of aspirin, beta-blockers, fibrinolytic therapy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors explain less than half of the 8.9% (95% CI 5.9, 11.8) and 6.9% (95% CI 2.7, 10.9) average annual reduction in case fatality in hospital for men and women, respectively.

    "541": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists have received increased therapeutic recognition in the treatment of hypertension. Although the overall effects of the ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists may seem superficially similar, there are important differences between the two classes in terms of neurohumoral activation, concomitant bradykinin potentiation, and inhibition of angiotensin II, derived not only from the classical ACE pathway, but also from alternative pathways. The AT1 receptor antagonist eprosartan has been shown to lower blood pressure effectively in hypertensive patients. When taken in the recommended dose range, 600-800 mg once daily, eprosartan is effective in patients with all grades of hypertension, regardless of age, sex or race. In several clinical studies, the blood-pressure-lowering effect of eprosartan has been shown to be at least as great as that of the ACE inhibitor enalapril. With respect to tolerability, eprosartan is superior to ACE inhibitor therapy and comparable to placebo. The pharmacological and therapeutic profiles of the expanding array of AT1 receptor antagonists differ in a number of respects. Most of these agents are biphenyl tetrazole, non-competitive antagonists, and some have active metabolites. Eprosartan differs from other AT1 receptor antagonists in that it is a non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole competitive antagonist without active metabolites. Several large-scale, ongoing clinical research programmes (e.g. LIFE, SCOPE and VALUE) are expected to provide information on the extent to which AT1 receptor antagonists, in comparison with other therapeutic regimens, reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different groups of hypertensive subjects. Meanwhile, current evidence suggests that the AT1 receptor antagonists provide a new approach to the management of hypertension and that they merit a fuller assessment in other cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "542": "ACE inhibitors are well established in the treatment of arterial hypertension, heart failure and diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy with albuminuria. The important trials for the various indications are briefly discussed. In Switzerland 11 ACE inhibitors are available for clinical use, differing mainly in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The characteristics of practical relevance regarding oral bioavailability, elimination mechanisms and half-life, as well as the necessary dosage modifications in patients with renal, hepatic and cardiac failure, are presented. All ACE inhibitors except captopril and lisinopril are administered as prodrugs. The bioavailability among ACE inhibitors varies widely with a range from 11% (trandolapril) to more than 60% (captopril). The great majority of ACE inhibitors are eliminated predominantly through the kidneys. However, benazepril, fosinopril, ramipril, spirapril and trandolapril also have a hepatic (metabolic) route of elimination. Since half-life varies from 1 h (captopril) to 30 h (spirapril) we drew up, for simplicity, a table of 3 groups with short, medium and long t1/2. In renal insufficiency dose adjustment is required only below a creatinine-clearance level of 30 ml/min. These dosage reductions are not required in liver diseases, but renally excreted drugs such as lisinopril should be preferred. Treatment with ACE inhibitors in severe heart failure should be initiated carefully, with low doses and concomitant diuretic treatment added or maintained. Most common adverse effects of ACE inhibitors are hypotension, cough, hyperkalaemia and renal failure. Less frequent adverse effects are angioedema, bone marrow suppression and also foetal damage. Thus, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy.", 
    "543": "Nonlinearity in circulation control attracts attention because nonlinearity is thought to be essential in the function of the living body. Many investigators have pointed out that the analysis of heart rate variability in particular is important in the analysis of autonomic nerve and cardiac function evaluation. Heart rate variability shows nonlinear behavior. However, until the present, many reports have been premised on linearity; linear correlation by frequency analysis has been used by many studies. However, in terms of this methodology, there is a problem applying it to the nonlinear living body. Therefore, fractal and chaos methodology has been used. The ascertainment of cardiac function has become important in allowing the clinical stage of a ventricular assist system to be successful. The purpose of this study was cardiac function evaluation by a methodology that was premised on nonlinearity. Chaos and fractal theory was used as a nonlinear dynamic theory. As a methodology of measurement, the volume of the left ventricle was used rather than an electrocardiogram, the waveform of arterial blood pressure. The volume was measured using acoustic quantification (AQ) ultrasonic echocardiography. Using these methodologies, the time series of many patients were analyzed. For example, drug administration was attempted in this study, and it was found that some drugs like ACE inhibitors showed a significant effect upon nonlinear dynamics in the cardiovascular system. The result, which attempted cardiac function evaluation by these various methodologies, is reported.", 
    "544": "ACE-I and specific ETA receptor blockade comparably prevented the development of structural cardiovascular alterations such as LVH, myocardial interstitial expansion and wall thickening of intramyocardial and extracardiac arteries in experimental renal failure. However, the decrease in myocardial capillary supply and the concomitant increase in intercapillary distance could only be prevented by ETA receptor antagonism. These capillary changes which have been shown to occur in experimental renal failure as well as in uraemic patients play an important role in the pathogenesis of reduced cardiac ischaemia tolerance in renal failure. The data argue for a potential role of the local renin-angiotensin system as well as of the ET system in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular changes in renal failure and for ET receptor blockade as a new therapeutic option in the treatment of these alterations. In particular, myocardial capillary supply, which is particularly important for ischaemia tolerance in renal failure, seems to be modulated and regulated predominantly by ET-1. In contrast to what was found with respect to structural and functional changes of the kidney in various experimental models of renal damage, a combination therapy--at least in the doses used--does not seem to provide additional benefit in the prevention of cardiovascular changes compared with the respective monotherapies.",

However, the level of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA in the ventricle was significantly augmented in 4-week-old SHRSP/Izm, which did not yet show overt ventricular hypertrophy, and its augmented expression lasted for the duration of the experimental period. The difference in the level of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA between the two strains was most prominent at the age of 4 weeks. This augmented expression of the cardiotrophin-1 gene was not related to the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy. The level of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA in other organs, including the kidney and lung, showed no significant change with aging and was not different between the two strains. After long-term treatment with lisinopril, levels of cardiotrophin-1 mRNA were not changed, although it morphologically prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. LIF mRNA was not detected in any ventricles examined by Northern blot analysis.",

However, it is unlikely that cardiotrophin-1 plays a mechanistic role in the development and maintenance of left ventricular hypertrophy in SHRSP/Izm.

    "557": "Insulin responsiveness was studied in isolated adipocytes from the normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat and the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). The effect of insulin (0.1 to 5 nmol/L) on glucose uptake (glucose transport and lipogenesis) was measured, and the maximal effect of insulin (Emax) and the dose of insulin required to elicit 50% of the maximal response (EC50) were calculated. A diminished Emax on lipogenesis without changes in the EC50 was detected in SHRs. The Emax was 0.49 +/- 0.09 (SHR) and 1.16 +/- 0.14 (WKY) micromol/10(5) cells (P < .05), and the EC50 was 0.13 +/- 0.03 and 0.11 +/- 0.02 nmol/L for WKY and SHR, respectively. Similar results were obtained when measuring insulin-stimulated glucose transport. A 30-day long-term treatment with enalapril (20 mg/kg/d) normalized insulin responsiveness in adipocytes from SHRs. The effect of enalapril was suppressed when SHRs were pretreated with enalapril and 150 microg/kg/d of the bradykinin (BK) B2-receptor blocker Hoe 140. Pretreatment with losartan (40 mg/kg/d) did not improve insulin action in the SHR. Since these results were obtained with isolated cells in which glucose availability was not a function of blood flow, and the effect of insulin in the SHR was improved by pretreatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor but not with the AT1-receptor blocker, it appears that the insulin resistance linked to the hypertension is not related to changes in blood flow.", 
    "558": "SCD continues to be an important cause of death and morbidity. Despite expanding insight into the mechanisms causing SCD, the population at high risk is not being effectively identified. Although there is still much to do in the management phase of SCD (predicting the efficacy of various therapies), recent clinical trials have helped define the relative risks and benefits of therapies in preventing SCD. Trials are underway to determine whether treating other patient populations, including asymptomatic patients after MI, will improve survival rate. The approach to reducing mortality rate will always be multifaceted; primary prevention of coronary artery disease and prompt salvage of jeopardized myocardium are 2 important aspects of this approach. In addition to interventions for MI, such as myocardial revascularization when indicated, simple and easily administered therapies that are likely to remain the most effective prophylactic interventions are aspirin, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and cholesterol-lowering agents. However, the MADIT and AVID data clearly demonstrate a role for ICD therapy in a subgroup of patients who have VT/VF and are at risk of cardiac arrest. Even though the absolute magnitude of benefit associated with ICDs is still to be determined, the AVID study and other recent reports provide convincing evidence that patients who have VT/VF fare better with ICDs than with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. For the high-risk population described in this article, in addition to aggressive anti-ischemic and heart failure therapy, ICDs are now a mainstay of life-saving treatment. Still to be surmounted is the challenge of identifying patients who have nonischemic substrates and of providing them with the appropriate therapy. Guided by genetic studies and new insight into the mechanisms of such problems as congenital long QT syndrome, life-saving and life-enhancing therapies may soon be available for the management of SCD.", 
    "559": "Bradykinin (BK) has been proposed as the principal mediator of hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) in patients dialyzed using negatively charged membranes and concomitantly treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We investigated the metabolism of exogenous BK added to the sera of 13 patients dialyzed on an AN69 membrane with a history of HSR (HSR+ patients) and 10 others who did not present such a reaction (HSR- patients) while dialyzed under the same conditions. No significant difference in the t1/2 of BK was found between the patient groups. However, the t1/2 of generated des-Arg9-BK was significantly increased (2.2-fold) in HSR+ patients compared to HSR-subjects. Preincubation of the sera with an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat) significantly increased the t1/2 of both BK and des-Arg9-BK in both groups. There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to the t1/2 of BK, but there was a significantly greater increase (3.8-fold) in the t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK in HSR+ patients compared to HSR-subjects. The level of serum aminopeptidase P (APP) activity showed a significant decrease in the HSR+ sera when compared to HSR-samples. In HSR- and HSR+ patients, a significant inverse relation (r2 = 0.6271; P < 0.00005) could be calculated between APP activity and des-Arg9-BK t1/2. In conclusion, HSR in hemodialyzed patients who are concomitantly treated with a negatively charged membrane and an ACE inhibitor can be considered as a multifactorial disease in that a decreased APP activity resulting in reduced degradation of des-Arg9-BK may lead to the accumulation of this B1 agonist that could be responsible, at least in part, for the signs and symptoms of HSR.", 
    "560": "In this study, we evaluated the bradykinin potentiating activity and ACE inhibitory activity of several Ang-(1-7)-related peptides: Ang-(2-7), Ang-(3-7), Ang-(4-7), Ang-(1-6), Ang-(1-5) and the selective antagonist of Ang-(1-7): D-[Ala7]Ang-(1-7) (A-779). In vivo experiments were performed in freely moving Wistar rats. ACE activity was evaluated by a fluorometric assay in rat plasma using Hip-His-Leu as a substrate. Intravenous injections of Ang-(1-7) (2.2 nmol) transformed the effect of a single dose of bradykinin (1 nmol) into the effect produced by a double dose. A similar bradykinin potentiating activity was demonstrated for Ang-(2-7) and Ang-(3-7). On the other hand, Ang-(1-5), Ang-(1-6), Ang-(4-7) and A-779 did not change the hypotensive effect of bradykinin in doses ranging from 8 up to 25 nmols. The hypotensive effect of bradykinin was increased by intravenous infusion (0.3 ng/min) of Ang-(1-7) > Ang-(2-7) > Ang-(3-7). Conversely, Ang-(1-5), Ang-(1-6), Ang-(4-7) or A-779 did not change the hypotensive effect of bradykinin. ACE inhibition with Ang-(1-7) related peptides occurred in the order: Ang-(2-7) > or = Ang-(3-7) > Ang-(1-7) [>] Ang-(1-5) > Ang-(4-7) > or = Ang-(1-6) > or = A-779. A-779 in concentrations up to 10(-5) M did not change the ACE inhibitory activity of Ang-(1-7). These results suggest that Ang-(1-7), Ang-(2-7) and Ang-(3-7) can modulate bradykinin actions in vivo. More important, our data pointed out that alternative mechanisms besides interaction with ACE are required to explain the bradykinin potentiating activity of Ang-(1-7).",

Information on left ventricular function was not available for 48% (range, 29% to 87% across the six hospitals). Among patients with systolic dysfunction, 77% were prescribed an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor at discharge, and 73% were prescribed digoxin. However, the mean daily ACE inhibitor dose was only 48% of the recommended target dose. Only 30% of all patients with atrial fibrillation were prescribed warfarin.",

    "565": "The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of the ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor imidapril, on the brain, when administered after the onset of stroke in a stroke-prone substrain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Learning deficits and induced lesions in the brain as well as in the kidneys and heart were investigated in detail. SHRSP were divided into two groups with or without salt loading at the age of 4 weeks. The salt loading was performed for 7-9 weeks to increase the incidence of stroke. Within 24 h after the first observation of stroke, animals were subsequently treated with 5 mg/kg imidapril orally once a day or the vehicle for up to the age of 27 weeks. Imidapril attenuated progression of neurological abnormalities such as irritability, hyperkinesia and motor dysfunction, and increased survival rate. In three-panel runway testing, learning deficits did not develop significantly in the imidapril-treated group, and was comparable to that in the non-salt-loaded/non-stroke group. Imidapril reduced oedema formation in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum, and also suppressed lesion formation in the kidneys and heart. Imidapril thus suppressed progression of neurological deficits with loss of learning ability following onset of stroke, and also suppressed formation of oedema in the brain and decreased the number of lesions in other organs. Imidapril-induced reduction of cerebrovascular damage, which presumably occurs in the brain after stroke, may account for the inhibitory effects of imidapril on lesion formation and learning impairment.",

Experiments were performed for 1 h on noradrenaline precontracted arterial rings in hypoxic conditions (95% N2 and 5% CO2). Nicardipine, lisinopril, losartan, phosphoramidon, FR139317 and bosentan were used to block Ca2+ channels, angiotensin I-converting enzyme, AT1 receptors, endothelin-converting enzyme, ETA receptors, and ETA/ETB receptors, respectively. The profile of the hypoxic contractile response was biphasic, displaying, after a short relaxation, a weak and transient contraction (from 2-4 min) and then, before complete relaxation, a slowly developed but sustained contraction (from 14-60 min). Endothelium removal abolished the transient contraction and reduced (-59%) the sustained contraction. Nicardipine did not modify the transient contraction, but concentration-dependently decreased (from -35% to -100%) the sustained contraction (P = 0.024). Lisinopril and losartan did not affect the response (P = 0.418 and P = 0.973, respectively). Bosentan did not modify the transient contraction, but concentration-dependently decreased (from -14% to -71%) the sustained contraction (P = 0.016), whereas phosphoramidon and FR139317 did not affect the response (P = 0.830 and P = 0.806, respectively).",

    "568": "Urinary excretion of albumin exceeds normal values in 10 to 25% of patients with essential hypertension. The level of albuminuria is highly correlated with arterial pressure, and more closely with ambulatory arterial pressure. The interaction between albuminuria and arterial pressure is enhanced by overweight, smoking, protein intake, insulin resistance, lipid abnormalities, and possibly genotypes of the components of the renin-angiotensin system. The renal mechanisms of microalbuminuria are not well elucidated. Notably, an increase in filtration fraction suggestive of intraglomerular hypertension was observed in patients with hyperfiltration. Microalbuminuria may be a marker of diffuse vascular abnormalities predisposing to cardiovascular disease and/or hypertensive renal disease heralding future renal failure, but its predictive value needs to be tested in more long-term follow-up studies. Antihypertensive treatment has a varied influence on albuminuria; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may correct this abnormality (at least partially) better than other agents.", 
    "569": "1. To study proteins transported with actin in axons, we pulse-labeled motoneurons in the chicken sciatic nerve with [35S]methionine and, 1-20 days later, isolated actin and its binding proteins by affinity chromatography of Triton soluble nerve extracts on DNase I-Sepharose. The DNase I-purified proteins were electrophoresed on two-dimensional gels and the specific activity of the radioactively labeled protein spots was estimated by fluorography. 2. In addition to actin, which binds specifically to DNase I, a small number of other proteins were labeled, including established actin monomer binding proteins and a protein of 36 kDa and pI 8.5. On the basis of its molecular mass, pI, amino acid composition, and immunostaining, the unrecognized protein was identified as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). 3. The high-affinity binding of GAPDH to actin was confirmed by incubation of Triton-soluble nerve extracts with either mouse anti-GAPDH (or antiactin) and indirect immunomagnetic separation with Dynabeads covalently linked to sheep anti-mouse antibody. Analysis by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting showed that actin and GAPDH were the main proteins isolated by these methods. 4. Analysis of labeled nerves at 12 and 20 days after pulse labeling showed that GAPDH and actin were transported at the same rate, i.e., 3-5 mm/day, which corresponds to slow component b of axonal transport. These proteins were not associated with rapidly transported proteins that accumulated proximal to a ligation 7 cm from the spinal cord 9 hr after injection of radioactivity. 5. Our results indicate that GAPDH and actin are transported as a complex in axons and raise the possibility that GAPDH could act as a chaperone for monomeric actin, translocating it to intraaxonal sites for exchange with or assembly into actin filaments. Alternatively, actin could be involved in translocating and anchoring GAPDH to specialized sites in axons and nerve terminals that require a source of ATP by glycolysis.",

Prolonged oral steroid therapy (>3 months) was used often or sometimes by 50.3%. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was very common, while lipid-lowering agents were rarely used. The variability in the treatment of FSGS most likely results from lack of evidence-based information and underscores the need for controlled pediatric multicenter treatment trials.",

    "582": "The possibility of the brain-specific expression of a component of the renin-angiotensin system was evaluated in the present study. We used the hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome complex to transfect human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cDNA, driven by the cytomegalovirus enhancer and beta-actin promoter, into the lateral cerebroventricle of male Sprague-Dawley rats. We evaluated the time course of hemodynamics, the tissue levels of angiotensin (Ang) II and vasopressin, and ACE activity. Intracerebroventricular transfection of the human ACE gene increased both blood pressure and heart rate. Transfected rats exhibited higher concentrations of brain Ang II and increased brain ACE activity. This activation of the brain angiotensin system was accompanied by increased vasopressin production. The increases in blood pressure and heart rate were abolished by intracerebroventricular administration of an ACE inhibitor or Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist. The expression of the transgene was widely distributed in the periventricular cell layer, the cortex, the hypothalamic nuclei, and the brain stem. Expression in the neuronal cells persisted for up to 14 days. Thus, this hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome method is a highly efficient system for gene delivery and is extremely useful for functional gene transfection. This novel hypertensive model may enable characterization of the functions of the renin-angiotensin system in the brain and determination of its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.",

We tested whether chronic ACE-inhibitor treatment would extend the lifespan of such old animals. We also studied cardiac hypertrophy and function, endothelial function and expression, and activity of NO synthase (eNOS). One hundred 15-month-old SHR were randomized into 3 groups, control (n=10), placebo-treated (n=45), and ramipril-treated with an antihypertensive dose of 1 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) in drinking water (n=45). Ex vivo experiments were performed after 15 months (control) and 21 months, when approximately 80% of the placebo group had died. Late treatment with ramipril significantly extended lifespan of the animals from 21 to 30 months. Fully established cardiac hypertrophy, observed in placebo-treated animals and in controls, was significantly reversed by ramipril treatment. In isolated working hearts, a significantly improved function associated with increased cardiac eNOS expression was seen versus placebo and control hearts. Endothelial dysfunction in isolated aortic rings from control and placebo-treated SHR was significantly improved by ACE inhibition and associated with enhanced NO release. Late treatment of SHR with the ACE inhibitor ramipril extended lifespan from 21 to 30 months, which is comparable to the lifespan of untreated normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. This lifespan extension, probably due to blood pressure reduction, correlated with increased eNOS expression and activity followed by a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac and vascular dysfunction.", 
    "584": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition significantly decreases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) without altering tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) during activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in humans. Because ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists differ in their effects on angiotensin II formation and bradykinin degradation, the present study compared the effect of equivalent hypotensive doses of an ACE inhibitor and AT(1) antagonist on fibrinolytic balance. Plasma PAI-1 antigen, tPA antigen, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone were measured in 25 normotensive subjects (19 white, 6 black; 14 men, 11 women; mean age 38.5+/-1.8 years; mean body mass index 25.3+/-0.7 kg/m(2)) during low salt intake alone (10 mmol Na/d), low salt intake + quinapril (40 mg PO bid), and low salt intake + losartan (50 mg PO bid). Compared with low salt alone (systolic blood pressure [BP] 118.8+/-2.2 mm Hg), both quinapril (106.3+/-2.5 mm Hg, P<0.001) and losartan (105.4+/-2. 8 mm Hg, P<0.001) reduced BP. No statistical difference was found between quinapril and losartan in their BP lowering effect. Losartan (P=0.009), but not quinapril, lowered heart rate. Both drugs significantly lowered aldosterone (P<0.001 versus low salt alone for each); however, this effect was significantly greater for quinapril than for losartan (P<0.001 for quinapril versus losartan). Treatment with quinapril, but not with losartan, was associated with a decrease in both PAI-1 antigen (P=0.03) and activity (P=0.018). PAI-1 activity was lower during treatment with quinapril than with losartan (P=0.015). The average PAI-1 antigen concentration was 13. 0+/-2.0 ng/mL during low salt alone, 10.5+/-1.6 ng/mL during quinapril treatment, and 12.3+/-2.1 ng/mL during losartan treatment. In contrast, plasma tPA antigen concentrations were reduced during treatment with losartan (P=0.03) but not with quinapril. This study provides the first evidence that ACE inhibitors and AT(1) antagonists differ in their effects on fibrinolytic balance under conditions of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Further studies are needed to address the mechanism for the contrasting effects of these 2 classes of drugs on fibrinolysis and to define the clinical significance of these differences.", 
    "585": "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a unique growth factor that has many protective functions against renal damage. Our previous study demonstrated that HGF stimulated the growth of endothelial and epithelial cells without the replication of mesangial cells. Moreover, angiotensin (Ang) II significantly decreased local HGF production in mesangial cells. Therefore, we examined the effects of Ang II blockade on renal HGF expression and renal damage in experimental hypertensive rats. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (cilazapril; 10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist (E-4177; 30 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), hydralazine (8 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), and vehicle were administered to 16-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) for 3 weeks. Renal damage was evaluated with a computer analysis system, and renal HGF mRNA was measured by Northern blot analysis. Blood pressure of SHR-SP was significantly decreased by all drug treatments compared with vehicle. Moreover, cilazapril, E-4177, and hydralazine significantly decreased the thickening and necrosis of blood vessels compared with vehicle. Similarly, degeneration and necrosis of glomeruli were also markedly improved by cilazapril and E-4177 (P<0.01). We next examined the effects of Ang II blockade on renal HGF expression in SHR-SP. Renal HGF mRNA was markedly decreased in SHR-SP compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats, although Ang II blockade by cilazapril and E-4177 but not hydralazine significantly increased renal HGF mRNA in SHR-SP. Ang II blockade significantly increased renal HGF (a protective growth factor for tubular epithelial cells); thus, we examined tubular histological appearance. Degeneration and necrosis of tubules were significantly improved by cilazapril and E-4177 treatment (P<0.01). In addition, cell infiltration into the glomeruli and hemorrhage were also significantly reduced in SHR-SP treated with cilazapril or E-4177. The present data demonstrated the prevention of renal damage by Ang II blockade in SHR-SP, which was accompanied by a significant increase in renal HGF mRNA. Given the strong mitogenic activity and antiapoptotic actions of HGF on endothelial and epithelial cells, we believe that increased local HGF production by the blockade of Ang II may improve renal function in hypertension.", 
    "586": "We previously reported that increased apoptosis participates in the regression of aortic hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats. To further document the potential role of apoptosis in cardiovascular therapy, we examined apoptosis during regression of hypertrophy in the heart of spontaneously hypertensive rats receiving the antihypertensive drug enalapril (30 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), losartan (30 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), nifedipine (35 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), hydralazine (40 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), propranolol (50 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), or hydrochlorothiazide (75 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) for 1 to 4 weeks, starting at 10 to 11 weeks of age. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured by the tail-cuff method. Markers of apoptosis included oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in extracted cardiac DNA or in situ in ventricular cross sections labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Cardiac DNA synthesis was evaluated by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation in vivo. All drugs reduced cardiac workload, defined as the product of blood pressure and heart rate, by >20% at 4 weeks. However, only nifedipine, enalapril, losartan, and propranolol reduced cardiac mass (>19%) within 4 weeks. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy was accompanied by a 50% to 300% increase in DNA fragmentation and a >20% reduction in DNA synthesis, resulting in a >20% reduction in cardiac DNA content after 4 weeks. Apoptosis induction occurred early and was transient within 4 weeks of nifedipine, enalapril, or losartan administration. With all regression-inducing drugs, the increase in DNA fragmentation occurred mainly in the subepicardium. Thus, transient induction of apoptosis in the subepicardium appears to be a characteristic feature of the early response to drug-induced regression of cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "587": "The effect of antihypertensive treatment on the development of large-artery remodeling in young animals has been widely studied, but reversal of established changes in older hypertensive animals has been largely ignored, although the latter represents a better paradigm for the human condition. We studied the effect of treatment with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide, from 3 months onward, on geometry and wall stress of the thoracic aorta of adult (9 months, maturation) and old (15 months, senescence) spontaneously hypertensive rats; normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as controls. At 3 months of age, blood pressure, medial cross-sectional area, and internal diameter were higher in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats. In both strains, medial cross-sectional area and lumen diameter increased during maturation; there was little change with senescence. Changes in blood pressure were minor. Because medial hypertrophy failed to compensate for the wider lumen and higher intraluminal pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, medial stress was higher in these rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide rapidly lowered blood pressure and medial cross-sectional area. Despite a marked fall in blood pressure, the internal diameter of the thoracic aorta of treated animals was similar to that of untreated animals after 6 months of treatment and started to fall only after the animals had been treated for 1 year. Thus, under treatment with captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide, medial stress remained elevated, even after very-long-term treatment, because medial cross-sectional area was not adapted to internal diameter. We suggest that some changes in large-artery structure associated with hypertension and aging, such as the increase in diameter, take considerable time to regress after blood pressure is lowered, and this may explain why, despite treatment, wall stress remains elevated.", 
    "588": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II) and metabolizes bradykinin and kallidin peptides. Decreased Ang II levels and increased kinin peptide levels are implicated in the mediation of the therapeutic effects of ACE inhibition. However, alternative non-ACE pathways of Ang II formation have been proposed to predominate in human heart. We investigated the effects of ACE inhibition on cardiac tissue levels of angiotensin and kinin peptides. High-performance liquid chromatography-based radioimmunoassays were used to measure angiotensin peptides and hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated bradykinin and kallidin peptides in right atrial appendages of subjects who had been prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass. Peptide levels in subjects who received ACE inhibitor therapy were compared with those who did not receive ACE inhibitor therapy. ACE inhibition reduced Ang II levels, which was associated with an 80% reduction in the Ang II/Ang I ratio. ACE inhibition did not modify either bradykinin or kallidin peptide levels or the bradykinin-(1-7)/bradykinin-(1-9) ratio. The 80% reduction in the Ang II/Ang I ratio by ACE inhibition indicated a primary role for ACE in the conversion of Ang I to Ang II in atrial tissue. These data support a role for reduced Ang II levels but do not support a role for increased kinin peptide levels in mediating the direct cardiac effects of ACE inhibition.",

Previous studies have suggested that acute DC shock injury is free radical mediated and that the administration of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase can reduce the level of DC shock-induced free radicals.

The objective of our study was to determine whether the ACE inhibitor captopril lowers free radicals after DC shocks.",

    "594": "Blood pressure regulation is a complex, dynamic process influenced by psychosocial, behavioral, and cultural factors. Integrative theories of cross-population differences in the prevalence of hypertension and response to treatment include physiological, social, and genetic perspectives. Ethnic differences in salt sensitivity, calcium regulation of sodium flux, vascular reactivity to psychosocial stress, and drug metabolism are integral components of observed cross-cultural variations in hypertension. In general, pharmacological treatment of hypertension in blacks is most consistently achieved through diuretics and calcium-channel blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers are more efficacious in whites. These stereotypical patterns are consistent with the higher prevalence of salt sensitivity, stress-induced vasoconstriction and slower natriuresis, and alpha-adrenergic receptor mediated vascular reactivity observed in blacks compared with whites. Some antihypertensive agents produce adverse glucose metabolic side effects, thus contraindicating their use in individuals with high sympathetic tone, insulin resistance, or obesity. Cross-population differences in adopted guidelines for treating hypertension exist but are not likely a factor in observed ethnic differences in rate of treatment or control. Attitudes toward nontraditional treatment options (e.g., herbal medicine), political and individual responsibilities in health care, and adaptations to acculturation and urbanization stress differ between and within societies and thus play a role in observed cross-cultural differences in hypertension as well. The value of regular exercise in controlling hypertension is widely recognized, and reductions in blood pressure reactivity to behavioral stress following acute exercise have been documented; however, empirical studies of ethnic differences in exercise-related blood pressure control are lacking. Overall, increased awareness of the multifactorial nature of hypertension by both the physician and the patient will facilitate treatment of this disease on an individual basis.", 
    "595": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition scintirenography was performed to help establish the diagnosis and plan treatment of renovascular hypertension (RVH) in 57 hypertensive pediatric patients, 33 infants and 24 children older than 1 year. In 16 of 33 hypertensive infants, ACE inhibition scintirenography established the diagnosis of RVH from renal ischemia (due to aortic or renal arterial thrombi). Two scintigraphic criteria were used for the diagnosis of RVH: criterion I, ischemic and damaged kidney (a non-functioning kidney on or off ACE inhibition) and criterion II, ischemic but not damaged kidney (ACE inhibition induced deterioration of function of the kidney). When criterion I was present and the contralateral kidney was normal, ACE inhibitors could be used for treatment of hypertension without deterioration of renal function; kidneys satisfying criterion I eventually involuted or manifested growth arrest and frequently caused persistent RVH, even after resolution of the thrombus, requiring nephrectomy. When criterion II was present bilaterally, or it was associated with criterion I contralaterally, the use of antihypertensive drugs other than ACE inhibitors was necessary in order to prevent renal insufficiency or failure from ACE inhibitors. However, kidneys with criterion II showed normal growth and, following retraction or dissolution of the aortic thrombus, hypertension resolved. In 2 of 24 hypertensive children older than 1 year, the test was diagnostic of branch renal artery stenosis; RVH was cured by selective angioplasty. ACE inhibition scintirenography is useful in the evaluation and planning of treatment in children with hypertension and may predict the outcome of therapy and ultimate renal function.",

It also inhibited the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration under hypoxic condition. Addition of nifedipine inhibited hypoxia-stimulated increase in the collagen, DNA synthesis, and [Ca2+]i.

    "600": "The efficacy of eprosartan, a highly selective, orally-active non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole, type 1 angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonist, was compared with that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, with the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) when necessary in patients with severe hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [sitDBP] > or = 115 mmHg and < or = 125 mmHg). Patients (n = 118) were randomized into an 8-week, double-blind titration phase and were started on oral eprosartan 400 mg total daily dose, given b.i.d., or oral enalapril 10 mg total daily dose, given o.d. The dose of eprosartan was increased to 600 and 800 mg daily, given b.i.d., and that of enalapril to 20 and 40 mg daily, given o.d., at weeks 2 and 4 if sitDBP was > or = 90 mmHg. If blood pressure remained uncontrolled on maximum doses of eprosartan or enalapril at week 6, HCTZ 25 mg o.d. was added to the treatment regimen. Patients whose blood pressure was deemed medically acceptable by the investigator at week 8 entered a 2-week maintenance phase on the final dose used in the titration phase. The primary efficacy measure was the difference between treatments of the mean reduction from baseline in sitDBP at the end of the study. Eprosartan and enalapril caused a similar reduction in sitDBP at study endpoint. The mean change in sitDBP at the end of the study for the eprosartan group was -20.1 mmHg vs -16.2 mmHg for the enalapril group. However, eprosartan produced significantly greater decreases in both sitting and standing systolic blood pressure (sitSBP and staSBP, respectively) than enalapril. The mean decrease in sitSBP was 29.1 mmHg for eprosartan compared with 21.1 mmHg for enalapril (p = 0.025). The mean reduction in staSBP was 27.8 mmHg for eprosartan compared with 20.0 mmHg for enalapril (p = 0.032). At the end of the study, the response rate (sitDBP < 90 mmHg or decreased from baseline by at least 15 mmHg) was 69.5% in the eprosartan group and 54.2% in the enalapril group. The proportion of patients in each treatment group who required addition of HCTZ was similar. Eprosartan was well tolerated; the overall incidence of adverse events was comparable to that in the enalapril group. These results demonstrate that in patients with severe hypertension, eprosartan is well tolerated and may be more effective than enalapril in reducing systolic blood pressure.", 
    "601": "A vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is present in the forearm vasculature of essential hypertensive patients and is closely related to the circulating renin profile. To test whether the haemodynamic effect of acute intrabrachial administration of captopril is related to the circulating and/or vascular RAS, 31 hypertensive patients were selected and divided into four groups according to their different circulating RAS profile (n = 7 hypertensive patients with primary aldosteronism and suppressed plasma renin activity; n = 7 low renin essential hypertensive patients; n = 8 normal renin essential hypertensive patients; n = 9 high renin renovascular hypertensive patients). The forearm net balance of active renin, plasma renin activity and angiotensin II, obtained by intrabrachial infusion of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 microg/100 ml/min) and calculated as the product of the venous-arterial plasma concentration gradient and forearm blood flow (FBF), was closely related to the circulating RAS. Captopril (0.25, 2.5, 25 microg/100 ml/min per 20 min each dose) unchanged basal FBF in the primary aldosteronism and low renin groups (FBF increase: from 3.9 +/- 0.4 to a maximum of 4.1 +/- 0.5 and from 3.8 +/- 0.3 to a maximum of 4.3 +/- 0.5 ml/100 ml/min, respectively), whereas it caused slight vasodilation in the normal renin group (from 3.9 +/- 0.3 to a maximum of 5.3 +/- 0.7 ml/100 ml/min), and pronounced vasodilation in the high renin group (from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to a maximum of 6.4 +/- 0.5 ml/100 ml/min). Captopril-induced vasodilation showed a significant direct correlation with the circulating and vascular RAS. The present data, while confirming the existence of a vascular RAS in the forearm of hypertensive patients indicate that the acute vasodilating effect of intrabrachial captopril is linked to a stimulated RAS, either circulating or vascular, supporting the evidence that, in acute conditions, ACE inhibitors exert their vasodilating effect through the RAS blockade.", 
    "602": "The importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in blood pressure regulation is well established. High RAS activity has also been implicated in connection with elevated cardiovascular risk in patients with essential hypertension. Data from epidemiological studies have related high plasma renin levels in essential hypertensive patients to cardiovascular complications. However, whether renin itself is a risk factor of cardiovascular events or just acts as a marker for other risk factors still remains to be elucidated. Several possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the association between elevated RAS activity and cardiovascular risk are reviewed. The concept of high RAS activity being a cardiovascular risk factor is strongly supported by results from large clinical studies showing the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in congestive heart failure and hypertension. Knowing more about the exact mechanisms of the association between high RAS activity and cardiovascular complications would enable us to profile the treatment of high blood pressure more specifically to improve outcome in individuals or groups of patients.", 
    "603": "We studied the effect of an ACE inhibitor (Enalapril [ENA], 10 mg o.d.) and a calcium-channel blocker (Nitrendipine [NIT], 20 mg o.d.) on insulin sensitivity in a double-blind cross-over study. Insulin sensitivity was measured by a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Serum potassium concentrations were kept constant during the clamp procedure by means of a variable potassium infusion. Twenty patients with essential hypertension (age 35+/-12 years [mean+/-SD], BMI 31.9+/-5.0 kg m2, initial blood pressure 152+/-10/99+/-6 mmHg) were treated with ENA or NIT for 4 weeks, respectively, with a wash-out period of 3 weeks. No carry-over effects or period effects were observed. Both drugs induced a comparable decline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (ENA - 15+/-9/ - 13+/-8 mmHg, NIT -16+/-8/- 12+/-6 mmHg). No significant change in body weight occurred with both treatments (ENA -0.4+/-2.0; NIT 0.6+/-1.1 kg). Neither drug had a significant impact on any parameter of insulin sensitivity measured (e.g. insulin sensitivity index SI: ENA 5.2+/-2.0 [basal 5.1+/-2.2], NIT 5.8+/-3.0 [basal SI 5.1+/-2.4) mi/min x m2/microU/ml). In conclusion, no significant differences between ENA and NIT on insulin sensitivity were observed. The reduction of blood pressure had no apparent effect on insulin sensitivity.", 
    "604": "Enalapril is a widely used antihypertensive drug with a very powerful in vitro acantholytic effect. It has been known to potentially induce pemphigus in genetically predisposed subjects. The action mechanism is complex and still only partially understood. We describe the case of a 66-year-old man, affected with intermediary basal cell carcinoma, in whom the histological examination showed suprabasal acantholytic clefts in the perilesional epidermis. Surprisingly a second biopsy taken from the apparently healthy skin of his back confirmed the presence of acantholytic changes. Clinical signs of pemphigus were absent. The patient's history did not reveal any relevant data but a mild arterial hypertension that had been treated for 1 year with 10 mg enalapril. Taking into account the patient's history (enalapril long-term administration), the absence of any bullous or erosive lesions and the histological findings, a diagnosis was made of in vivo enalapril-induced acantholysis.", 
    "605": "The aims of the treatment of heart failure are to improve the quality of life and slow the progression of cardiac disease. Improvement of quality of life is best assessed by questionnaire; progression of the disease is assessed by measuring mortality and morbidity. The agenda for the future is to establish intermediate markers for progression of cardiac disease that can be substituted for morbidity and mortality, and thus improve the efficiency and shorten the follow-up of clinical trials. At present, polypharmacy is required to achieve optimal improvements in quality and duration of life. Furthermore, some drugs may favorably affect one end point and adversely affect the other; for example, beta-blockers may exert adverse short-term effects on quality of life but may slow progression of the disease. Certain inotropic drugs may reduce symptoms but shorten life expectancy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have exerted favorable effects on both quality of life and mortality, but the magnitude of these benefits has been disappointingly small. Persistent angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction and endocrine effects, despite ACE inhibition, is one possible explanation. The Valsartan in Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) has been designed to test the efficacy and safety of the AT(1) receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan in combination with ACE inhibitors and all other prescribed therapies in patients with heart failure. The study is powered to detect a mortality benefit and should therefore establish the role of ARBs in this patient group. When this trial and other ongoing studies are completed, we will be more able to define the role of ARBs in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "606": "Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy has received interest since the publication of the JNC-VI report. Relatively few head-to-head comparative studies between fixed-dose combinations and first-line monotherapies for hypertension have been published. The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of various first-line monotherapies and the fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril. The results of the meta-analysis were used to compare the efficacy and safety of the first-line monotherapies with amlodipine/benazepril. The meta-analysis included 82 studies that included 110 treatment groups (cohorts). The study compared nine different monotherapies and one combination therapy (amlodipine/benazepril). Of the 82 studies, 22 were placebo-controlled and 60 were active treatment controlled. The mean absolute decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) ranged from 9.7 to 13.3 mm Hg with verapamil showing the greatest effect and captopril the least (13.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; 9.7 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, respectively). When studies were weighted by sample size, atenolol, verapamil, lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest BP effect. When studies were weighted by variance, amlodipine/benazepril and atenolol showed the greatest BP effect. The percentage of patients controlled on therapy ranged from 54% to 79%. Lisinopril and amlodipine/benazepril showed the greatest percent controlled. The overall incidence of adverse effects ranged from 12.1% to 41.8% with lisinopril having the lowest and nifedipine having the highest incidence. The overall incidence of adverse effects resulting in drug discontinuance ranged from 1.3% to 10.7%, with amlodipine/benazepril having the lowest and nifedipine having the highest incidence. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that amlodipine/benazepril produces above average reductions in BP with a lower than average incidence of overall side effects and the lowest incidence of adverse effects resulting in drug discontinuance. The fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/benazepril achieves its goal of effective BP lowering with a minimum of significant side effects.",

    "608": "Data from 485 hypertensive patients who underwent a captopril test in consecutive order at our institution were analysed retrospectively. After a 30-min resting period in the supine position 50 mg of captopril was given orally. Blood was collected before and 90 min after dosage for the determination of plasma renin concentration (normal range 3.5-8.0 ng/ml/h). An increase by 100% or more of the baseline value was considered a positive response. Blood pressure was recorded at baseline and at 90 min.", 
    "609": "A positive response was present in 62 patients; further diagnostic work-up revealed significant renal artery stenosis in 11 of these patients. In the 423 patients with a negative response renal artery stenosis was found in three cases. With some limitations of retrospective analyses in mind, sensitivity and specificity of the test were calculated as 79% and 89%, respectively. No severe complication occurred during the test.", 
    "610": "Our data on the diagnostic indices and the safety of the captopril test are in good agreement with most published series. Altogether, available data suggest that the captopril test has a limited diagnostic accuracy as a screening test for the detection of renovascular hypertension.

    "611": "When patients with acute porphyrias are treated with antihypertensives and analgesics, they could be placed at increased risk of developing porphyric attacks, since little is known about the potential for many of these drugs to induce these attacks. We used primary chick embryo liver cells, which maintain intact heme synthesis and regulation, to study the effects of antihypertensives and analgesics on porphyrin accumulation. Cells were treated with desferrioxamine to block heme synthesis partially, simulating conditions encountered in porphyric patients. Typically, cells were treated for 20 hr with the test drugs (3.16 to 1000 microM), along with desferrioxamine. Porphyrins were measured spectrofluorometrically, as uro-, copro,- and protoporphyrin. The evaluated drugs included six antihypertensives (two calcium channel blockers, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, and three inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme) and eight analgesics. Of the calcium channel blockers tested, nifedipine greatly increased porphyrin accumulation, whereas diltiazem caused only a slight increase. Losartan (an angiotensin receptor antagonist), captopril, or lisinopril (two angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) produced only small increases in porphyrin accumulation. In contrast, enalapril (another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) substantially increased porphyrin accumulation when given in high concentrations. Among the analgesics tested, fentanyl and tramadol produced the highest porphyrin accumulations. Nalbuphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and dezocine were moderately or weakly porphyrogenic, whereas buprenorphine and morphine did not increase porphyrin accumulation. These studies suggest that patients with acute porphyrias may be at greater risk for developing porphyric attacks when treated with nifedipine (compared with diltiazem), enalapril (compared with captopril or lisinopril), and tramadol (compared with the other analgesics).", 
    "612": "Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in adults older than 65 years, and it is currently the most costly cardiovascular disorder in the United States, with estimated annual expenditures in excess of $20 billion. Recent studies have shown that selected pharmacological agents, behavioral interventions, and surgical therapies are associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure, but the cost implications of these diverse treatment modalities are not widely appreciated. In this review, a brief outline of cost-effectiveness analysis is provided, and current data on the cost-effectiveness of specific approaches to managing heart failure are discussed. Available evidence indicates that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, other vasodilators, digoxin, carvedilol, multidisciplinary heart failure management teams, and heart transplantation are all cost-effective approaches to treating heart failure; moreover, some of these interventions may result in net cost savings.", 
    "613": "Severe atherosclerotic narrowing of one or more coronary arteries is responsible for myocardial ischemia and angina pectoris in most patients with stable angina pectoris. The coronary arteries of patients with stable angina also contain many nonobstructive plaques, which are prone to fissures or rupture resulting in presentation of acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, myocardial infarction, sudden ischemic death). In addition to symptomatic relief of symptoms and an increase in angina-free walking time with antianginal drugs or revascularization procedures, the recent emphasis of treatment has been to reduce adverse clinical outcomes (coronary death and myocardial infarction). The role of smoking cessation, aspirin, treatment of elevated lipids, and treatment of high blood pressure in all patients and of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with diminished systolic left ventricular systolic function in reducing adverse outcomes has been well established. What is unknown, however, is whether any anti-anginal drugs (beta-blockers, long-acting nitrates, calcium channel blockers) effect adverse outcomes in patients with stable angina pectoris. Recent trials evaluated the usefulness of suppression of ambulatory ischemia in patients with stable angina pectoris, but it remains to be established whether suppression of ambulatory myocardial ischemia with antianginal agents or revascularization therapy is superior to pharmacologic therapy targeting symptom relief. Patients who have refractory angina despite optimal medical treatment and are not candidates for revascularization procedures may be candidates for newer techniques of transmyocardial revascularization, enhanced external counterpulsation, spinal cord stimulation, or sympathectomy. The usefulness of these techniques, however, needs to be confirmed in large randomized clinical trials.",

To minimize the excessive risk of recurrent cardiac events in these people, evidence-based, cost-effective prevention strategies must be developed. This review highlights the evidence supporting commonly used means of secondary prevention and is divided into two major sections: lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic interventions. Lifestyle changes discussed include smoking cessation, especially newer pharmacologic adjuncts; the efficacy of dietary interventions; and current inroads into the treatment of depression in recurrent events. Pharmacologic innovations include reexamination of a role for warfarin; continued advances in the treatment of hyper- and dyslipidemias, new roles for beta-blockade in congestive heart failure, and finally a view of future measures, risk and targets of risk intervention.",

    "618": "The effects of chronic treatment with losartan. an AT1 receptor antagonist, on the tissue content of bradykinin (BK) and des-Arg9-BK and on their pharmacological effects were examined in the carrageenan-induced paw edema model (0.5% solution, 50 microl/paw) in the rat. These effects were compared with those of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). For this purpose, rats were chronically treated with losartan (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day) and enalapril or quinapril (1 mg/kg/day). Endogenous BK and des-Arg9-BK tissue contents at the site of local inflammation were measured by highly sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassays. Losartan 3 mg/kg/day for 7, 14 and 28 days had no significant effect on carrageenan-induced paw edema, but both losartan 10 and 30 mg/kg/day for 14 days significantly increased the hindpaw volume by 50% at 3 h and by 59% at 5 h. These effects, similar to those measured for ACEi, were inhibited by icatibant, a B2 kinin receptor antagonist (32.5 nmol/paw), that reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema to the level seen in vehicle-treated rats. In the same model, and contrary to ACEi, losartan 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day for 14 days had no significant effect on endogenous BK and des-Arg9-BK levels in the local inflammatory site or on circulating and tissue ACE activities. These results show, at least in that model, that the potentiating effects of losartan on carrageenan-induced paw edema are independent of the concentrations of endogenous kinins.", 
    "619": "It was reported previously that dietary fish oil supplementation retarded the progression of renal disease in patients with IgA nephropathy in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, 2-yr clinical trial. The aim of this study was to determine the long-term influence of fish oil treatment on renal progression in observations on the study cohort of 106 patients extending beyond the 2-yr trial. Renal function was assessed by serial serum creatinine and 24-h urine protein measurements. Vital, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and BP status and treatment beyond completion of the 2-yr trial were determined. As in the trial, the primary end point was an increase of 50% or more in the serum creatinine, and the secondary end point was ESRD. After a mean follow-up of 6.4 yr, 46 patients-17 in the fish oil group versus 29 in the placebo group-reached the primary end point (P = 0.002), and 27 patients-eight in the fish oil group versus 19 in the placebo group-developed ESRD (P = 0.009). At the end of the 2-yr trial, 75 patients (45 fish oil, 30 placebo) remained at risk for the primary end point. This is also when the double-blind part of the trial ended, allowing physicians to stop supplements, switch original placebo-assigned patients to fish oil, and continue fish oil in original fish oil-assigned patients. A significantly greater number of nonsupplemented placebo patients developed the primary end point (P = 0.02) and ESRD (P = 0.003) compared with long-term supplemented fish oil patients. Conversely, more fish oil-supplemented patients had stable renal function than nonsupplemented patients (P = 0.02). By intention, BP control, primarily treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, was equal in the fish oil and placebo groups. Proteinuria was modestly reduced in both groups. It is concluded that early and prolonged treatment with fish oil slows renal progression for high-risk patients with IgA nephropathy.", 
    "620": "The intrarenal factors responsible for hypertension in double-transgenic rats (dTGR) harboring human renin and human angiotensinogen genes are unclear. The pressure-natriuresis and -diuresis relationships in response to chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade were evaluated. Renal renin-angiotensin and nitric oxide (NO) system gene expression was also investigated. Six-week-old dTGR were treated for 3 wk with submaximal doses of cilazapril (10 mg/kg, orally) or losartan (10 mg/kg, orally) or with the drug combination. In untreated dTGR, pressure-natriuresis relationships were maximally shifted rightward by approximately 70 to 80 mmHg, and both renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR were markedly decreased. Submaximal cilazapril and losartan dosages both decreased systolic BP by 30 mmHg and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward by 25 to 30 mmHg. Cilazapril increased RBF and GFR to values observed in normotensive control animals but did not significantly affect fractional sodium excretion (FENa) or fractional water excretion (FEH2O) curves. In contrast, losartan had no significant effect on RBF or GFR but shifted the FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. The cilazapril and losartan combination completely normalized BP and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward more than did either drug alone. When cilazapril and losartan were administered at higher doses (30 mg/kg, orally), the two drugs equally shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward, by 50 mmHg. Both drugs increased RBF and GFR; however, only losartan shifted FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. Human and rat renin and angiotensinogen genes were downregulated in dTGR and were increased by losartan and cilazapril treatments, whereas no changes in the expression of rat ACE and AT1A receptor genes were observed. Endothelial NO synthase expression was increased by cilazapril but not by losartan. Neither inducible NO synthase nor neural NO synthase gene expression was affected by drug treatments. Therefore, submaximal ACE inhibition enhanced sodium excretion mainly by increasing RBF and GFR, whereas submaximal AT1 receptor blockade decreased tubular sodium and water reabsorption. The combination of the two drugs produced an additive effect. The ACE inhibitor effects may involve increased endothelial NO synthase expression, perhaps related to the inhibition of bradykinin degradation.", 
    "621": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased prevalence of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary and cerebrovascular disease. The risk of an individual of developing CVD is much greater when both diseases coexist and is further magnified by their frequent association with dyslipidemia, coagulation, platelet, and endothelial abnormalities. Metabolic abnormalities frequently associated with hypertension are insulin resistance, enhanced coagulation, and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Drug treatment of hypertension in diabetic subjects is fraught with potential difficulties, including altered efficacy of medications, possible side effects, worsening of glycemic control, and impairment of lipid metabolism. Because hypertension is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in diabetes, it should be recognized and treated early and aggressively despite these difficulties. This article reviews the efficacy and side effects of the various classes of antihypertensive agents in patients with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "622": "The natriuretic response to a dopamine 1-like receptor agonist is blunted in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Whether the renal vasodilator response to D1-like receptor stimulation in SHRs is defective also is unclear. To determine whether the renal hemodynamic response to a D1-like receptor is impaired in SHR, we examined the effect of a continuous infusion of the D1-like receptor agonist fenoldopam (2 microg/kg/min) on systemic and renal hemodynamics in conscious SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. As an active control, we used an equivalent antihypertensive dosage of captopril (10 mg/kg). Fenoldopam significantly increased effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) in WKY rats (+22 +/- 5%; p < 0.01), whereas this response was absent in SHRs (+7 +/- 3%; NS). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly reduced in SHRs (-11 +/- 2%; p < 0.001), demonstrating a systemic vasodilator response to fenoldopam in SHRs. The reduction in renal vascular resistance (RVR) was more pronounced in WKY rats (-24 +/- 2%) than in SHRs (-13 +/- 4%; p < 0.05). Captopril significantly increased ERPF in SHRs (+16 +/- 3%; p < 0.001), demonstrating a preserved renal vasodilatory capacity in SHRs. The blunting of the renal vasodilatory response to fenoldopam in SHRs is present during a high as well as a low sodium intake. In conscious SHRs, the renal vasodilatory response to a D1-like receptor agonist is impaired, whereas the blood pressure response is more pronounced. The preserved renal vasodilatory response to captopril indicates that the defective vasodilatory response in SHRs is functional rather than due to altered structural properties of the renal vascular bed.", 
    "623": "The effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin receptor ligands sarmesin ([Sar1, Tyr(Me)4] Ang II) and saralasin ([Sar1, Ala8] Ang II) administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) on acute anoxic hypoxia were studied in mice. The interactions of these ligands and of amastatin (an aminopeptidase A inhibitor) after pretreatment with Ang II and sarmesin, respectively, were also studied. Ang II decreased the latency to hypoxia-induced convulsive seizures and altered survival time (increase or decrease depending on the dose). Sarmesin and saralasin significantly increased the latency to seizures as well as survival time. Pretreatment with saralasin and sarmesin antagonized the Ang II effect on the latency to seizures. Both drugs increased the Ang II effect on the survival time. Amastatin tended to increase the effect of sarmesin on the survival time. Taken together, the results suggest that the antihypoxic effect of sarmesin and saralasin is most likely due to an action on Ang II receptors, with the agents behaving as partial agonists.", 
    "624": "Kidney cortex and proximal tubular angiotensin II (ANG II) levels are greater than can be explained on the basis of circulating ANG II, suggesting intrarenal compartmentalization of these peptides. One possible site of intracellular accumulation is the endosomes. In the present study, we tested for endosomal ANG I, ANG II, angiotensin type 1A receptor (AT(1A)), and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and determined whether these levels are regulated by salt intake. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed chow containing either high or low dietary sodium for 10-14 days. Blood and kidneys were harvested and processed for measurement of plasma, kidney, and renal intermicrovillar cleft and endosomal angiotensin levels. Kidney ANG I averaged 179 +/- 20 fmol/g and ANG II averaged 258 +/- 36 fmol/g in rats fed a high-sodium diet and were significantly higher, averaging 347 +/- 58 fmol/g and 386 +/- 55 fmol/g, respectively, in rats fed a low-salt diet. Renal intermicrovillar clefts and endosomes contained ANG I and ANG II. Intermicrovillar cleft ANG I and ANG II levels averaged 8.4 +/- 2.6 and 74 +/- 26 fmol/mg, respectively, in rats fed a high-salt diet and 7.6 +/- 1.7 and 70 +/- 25 fmol/mg in rats fed a low-salt diet. Endosomal ANG I and ANG II levels averaged 12.3 +/- 4.4 and 43 +/- 19 fmol/mg, respectively, in rats fed a high-salt diet, and these levels were similar to those observed in rats fed a low-salt diet. Renal endosomes from rats fed a low-salt diet demonstrated significantly more AT(1A) receptor binding compared with rats fed a high-salt diet. ACE activity was detectable in renal intermicrovillar clefts and was 2.5-fold higher than the levels observed in renal endosomes. Acute enalaprilat treatment decreased ACE activity in renal intermicrovillar clefts by 90% and in renal endosomes by 84%. Likewise, intermicrovillar cleft and endosomal ANG II levels decreased by 61% and 52%, respectively, in enalaprilat-treated animals. These data demonstrate the presence of intact angiotensin peptides and ACE activity in renal intermicrovillar clefts and endosomes, indicating that intact angiotensin peptides are formed and/or trafficked through intracellular endosomal compartments and are dependent on ACE activity.", 
    "625": "Reported is the preparation of wheat germ (WG) hydrolyzate with potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, and the characterization of peptides responsible for ACE inhibition. Successful hydrolyzate with the most potent ACE inhibitory activity was obtained by 0.5 wt.%-8 h Bacillus licheniformis alkaline protease hydrolysis after 3.0 wt.%-3 h alpha-amylase treatment of defatted WG (IC50; 0.37 mg protein ml(-1)). The activity of WG hydrolyzate was markedly increased by ODS and subsequent AG50W purifications (IC50; 0.018 mg protein ml(-1)). As a result of isolations by high performance liquid chromatographies, 16 peptides with the IC50 value of less than 20 microM, composed of 2-7 amino acid residues were identified from the WG hydrolyzate. Judging from the high content (260 mg in 100 g of AG50W fraction) and powerful ACE inhibitory activity (IC50; 0.48 microM), Ile-Val-Tyr was identified as a main contributor to the ACE inhibition of the hydrolyzate.",

Because the vascular disease associated with hypertension evolves over the years, we investigated platelet activity parameters in a population of older hypertensive patients with no other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "627": "We studied 34 older, nonsmoking patients (mean age 74 +/- 5 years) with uncomplicated hypertension before and after the normalization of blood pressure (BP) was achieved with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril alone or in combination with the Ca2+ antagonist nifedipine.",

    "629": "All platelet hyperactivity parameters were reduced significantly with the normalization of BP at the end of antihypertensive drug treatment (systolic/diastolic: 186.2 +/- 2.7/103.4 +/- 1.1 mm Hg vs 135.0 +/- 1.3/85.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg; P < .001). Those factors more strictly associated with endothelium injury, such as ET-1 and IL-6, did not show variations. A significant correlation (Spearman Rank test) was observed among all platelet function parameters and blood pressure values.", 
    "630": "This study demonstrated that even in a population of older hypertensive patients with no other risk factor for atherogenic disease, normalization of blood pressure induces a significant reduction of the parameters of enhanced platelet hyperactivity independent of the action exerted, at the platelet level, by the antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "631": "Many studies have shown that loss of endothelium-derived nitric oxide is a major factor of ischemic episodes in patients with coronary artery disease and there is increasing evidence to suggest that nitric oxide might exert antiatherosclerotic actions. Based on these concepts, the results of animal studies on the effects of lipid lowering drugs, antioxidants, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, Ca2+ channel blockers, estrogens and agents which modulate nitric oxide bioavailability are presented and compared to the results of patient studies and clinical trials. In spite of encouraging results obtained with antioxidants in animals, clinical trials could only show a clear positive effect of vitamin E treatment on the outcome of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can ameliorate endothelial dysfunction in coronary heart disease, but their impact on disease progression remains unclear. There is evidence that estrogen replacement therapy in post-menopausal women may increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Finally, improved endothelial function and plaque stability clearly contribute to the clinical benefits of lipid lowering interventions, statins in particular. Taken together, these studies lend support to the concept that improving endothelial function and nitric oxide release might serve as valuable elements in the prevention or therapy of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "632": "Uptake of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril by rabbit small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles was examined. In the presence of an inward H+ gradient the uptake of this peptide mimetic drug was accelerated and an overshoot phenomenon was observed. The uptake was more stimulated by higher H+ gradient. Initial uptake rate was saturable in the presence of an inward H+ gradient, with apparent Km value of 4.2 mM. These findings suggest the involvement of the H+-coupled carrier-mediated transport in the uptake of enalapril. The uptake was inhibited by ACE inhibitor trandolapril but hardly or only slightly inhibited by aminocephalosporins.", 
    "633": "The inhibitory effects of five angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the uptake of an aminocephalosporin antibiotic, cefroxadine, by rabbit small intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles were examined in the presence of an inward H+ gradient. Dixon plot analysis showed that all these ACE inhibitors inhibited the uptake of cefroxadine, which is transported by a H+/oligopeptide transporter in the membrane, in the order of enalapril<quinapril, benazepril<temocapril, trandolapril at extravesicular pH 6.0. These drugs, except for enalapril, which are relatively hydrophobic, exhibited a mix of competitive and noncompetitive inhibition. We also examined the inhibitory effects of quinapril and temocapril at extravesicular pH 5.5, at which the ratio of the zwitterionic species of the drugs increased. The inhibition occurred in a nearly competitive manner at this pH and the inhibitory effects were stronger than at pH 6.0. Regression analysis of the inhibitory effects suggested that the affinity of these ACE inhibitors for the transporter was regulated by the hydrophobicity of these ACE inhibitors and the ratio of the zwitterionic species of the drugs.", 
    "634": "The relationship between renal perfusion pressure and urinary sodium is involved in arterial pressure regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of renal nerves and angiotensin II in the pressure-natriuresis relationship. Experiments were performed in anaesthetised cats in which one kidney was surgically denervated. Renal perfusion pressure (RPP), renal blood flow (RBF) glomerular filtration rate (GFR, creatinine clearance), urinary volume (V) and sodium excretion (Una + V) were separately measured from both kidneys. RPP was progressively reduced in two consecutive steps by a suprarenal aortic snare. Two groups of animals were studied: the first without any pharmacological treatment (Untreated), the second during treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (Captopril, 0.4 mg/Kg intravenously followed by an infusion of 0.4 mg/Kg/h). In the Untreated group RPP was reduced from 152.4 +/- 7.3 to 113.6 +/- 5.8 and 83.0 +/- 4.4 mmHg during the first and second step respectively. RBF and GFR were only slightly reduced during the second step of reduced RPP. In control conditions V and UNa + V were greater in the denervated compared to the innervated kidney. The graded decrease in RPP reduced both V and UNa + V in the innervated as well as in the denervated kidney. In the Captopril group V and UNa + V were larger than in the Untreated group in both the innervated and the denervated kidney. A decrease of RPP similar to that observed in the Untreated group, produced similar haemodynamic changes. Also in the Captopril group the graded decrease in RPP reduced both V and UNa + V in the innervated as well as in the denervated kidney. Matching UNa + V against RPP values significant correlations were found in the innervated and denervated kidneys of both groups. Both renal denervation and ACE inhibition were accompanied by an increased gain of the pressure-natriuresis curve, but only renal denervation shifted the crossing of the pressure axis to the left. In the ACE inhibited animals renal denervation only shifted the curve to the left. In conclusion our data suggest that i) at each level of RPP renal nerves and angiotensin II decrease renal sodium excretion, ii) renal nerves and angiotensin II increase the slope of the renal function curve, iii) renal nerves shift to the right the renal function curve.", 
    "635": "A lot of evidence points to the important role of the renin-angiotensin system in the physiopathology of hypertension and the progression of chronic renal failure. In this review, the authors report the data concerning the protective effects of antagonists of angiotensin II AT1 receptors (AT1ra). The AT1 ra have been shown to have beneficial effects in most experimental models of nephropathy in which they have been tested (renal ischaemia, essential or induced hypertension, glomerulonephritis, 5/6 nephrectomy, renal transplantation, induced diabetes, toxic and radiotherapy-induced nephropathy). Clinical trials confirm these beneficial effects. In healthy subjects and hypertensive patients, the AT1 ra have identical effects to those of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on renal haemodynamics. In hypertensives, Candesartan and Irbesartan increase renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate and decrease the filtration fraction. Two studies have also shown that Candesartan and Irbesartan reduce proteinuria in diabetic patients. Similar results have been reported in essential hypertension with renal failure. These data suggest that AT1 ra have beneficial effects on the progression of experimental kidney disease and on proteinuria in the clinical setting. Of the pharmacological agents available for use in this class, it is essential to propose molecules whose efficacy in antagonising the effects of angiotensin II lasts throughout the 24 hour period. Clinical trials are under way to evaluate the effects of AT1 ra on renal function in man over a long period.", 
    "636": "Heart failure is a major and still growing medical and epidemiological problem, but in the last 10-20 years great progress has been made in its treatment. Alleviating symptoms is not (any longer) the only aim of the treatment; improving the life expectation or reducing the mortality has become a different, at least as important aim. Left ventricular dysfunction, even if asymptomatic, should be regarded, just as hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, as a risk factor for which efficacious treatment is available and which consequently should be treated. A problem in this respect is that the effect of treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and of mild forms of heart failure is difficult to measure. Beta-blocking agents have proved to be the greatest gain in the treatment of heart failure in recent years, in addition to ACE inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin. These preparations should be prescribed with caution and due consideration. However, their favourable influence is such that use on a much larger scale than currently appears to be justified.", 
    "637": "A rapid, simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of captopril in plasma has been developed. Captopril is derivatized with a new reagent, 2-bromo-2'-acetonaphthone to form a product that showed ultraviolet-absorbing properties. For plasma samples, the protein was removed with 6% perchloric acid and the derivatized captopril was extracted with diethyl ether. The chromatographic separation was performed on an analytical mu bondapak NH2 column (300 x 3.9 mm, i.d.) with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of n-hexane-2-propanol-methanol-acetic acid (68:15:15:2). Using ultraviolet detection at 246 nm, the quantification limit for captopril in plasma was 10 ng/ml. The calibration curve was linear over the concentration range 12.5-500 ng/ml. The average recovery was 95% for plasma. The inter-day and intra-day assay coefficients of variation were found to be less than 12%.", 
    "638": "Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors affects the autoregulation of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration and provides renal protective effects. The purpose of this case-control study was to investigate the effects of chronic ACE inhibition on perioperative renal hemodynamics and function.", 
    "639": "We prospectively studied renal function in two groups of patients, chronically treated or not, with ACE inhibitors (ACEI and control; n = 16, in each group) who underwent elective cardiac surgery under hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, osmolar clearance and fractional excretion of sodium and potassium were determined before, during and after CPB. Additional measurements included plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) as well as plasma and urinary cyclic GMP (cGMP), thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and 6-keto-PGF1.", 
    "640": "Renal functional and hemodynamic variables did not differ between the two groups, at any period. Cardiopulmonary bypass induced increases in urinary flow, osmolar clearance and fractional excretion of sodium and potassium in both groups. Plasma and urinary ratio of 6-keto-PGF to TxB2 increased markedly and reflected a predominant systemic and renal release of vasodilatory prostaglandins. Intraoperatively, ANF was higher in ACEIs than in control patients.", 
    "641": "Long term treatment with ACE inhibitors does not influence the perioperative changes in renal hemodynamics and function. During cardiopulmonary bypass, a transient impairment in solute reabsorption is associated with renal release of vasodilatory mediators (nitric oxide and prostacyclin).", 
    "642": "The prevalence of nonischemic heart failure including idiopathic dilative cardiomyopathy is not well known. It may vary considerably in different population sub-groups and geographic areas. In ambulatory and hospitalized patients with clinically manifest heart failure primary cardiomyopathy is diagnosed in 2-15%, while in recent large scale therapeutic trials the proportion of patients with nonischemic heart failure ranged from 18% to 53%. There is a relation between sex, age and etiology of chronic heart failure, nonischemic cardiomyopathy being more frequent in women and in younger individuals. In contrast to ischemic heart failure, where the severity usually correlates with the extent of coronary artery lesions, the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy is less clear. Genetic factors, myocarditis from infectious agents, auto-immune mechanisms, cytokine activation, hormonal and metabolic influences can play a role. The functional consequences of myocardial damage in nonischemic heart failure is a global instead of localized abnormality of ventricular contractility. There is epidemiological evidence that in general the prognosis of nonischemic heart failure is better than in ischemic heart failure. The mortality of patients with ischemic heart failure was usually higher in the placebo groups of recent heart failure trials than in patients with nonischemic etiology. Furthermore, therapeutic responses to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, amlodipine and amiodarone were also different in some studies. The outcome of nonischemic heart failure is better even in transplant candidates with the most advanced stages of heart failure, they survive longer and respond better to intensified drug regimens than patients with similar clinical severity of ischemic heart failure. Thus, an early and precise diagnosis of the etiology of heart failure should be encouraged not only in clinical trials but also in every day patient management. As more therapeutic options are developed, individualized drug selection for patients with various etiologies of heart failure may become possible.", 
    "643": "Published clinical practice guidelines from the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the Task Force of the Working Group on Heart Failure of the European Society of Cardiology--supported by the results of numerous large-scale randomized controlled trials--define the standard universal pharmacologic approach to all patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. According to these guidelines, all heart failure patients regardless of etiology (with rare exceptions such as obstructive valvular heart disease) should be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as first-line treatment of the heart failure. In fact, the non-edematous patient with only mild exertional dyspnea may be treated with an ACE inhibitor as sole therapy of the left ventricular dysfunction. As patients become edematous or complain of more moderate congestive symptoms, it is then appropriate to add a diuretic along with the ACE inhibitor. Digoxin is reserved for those patients who remain symptomatic on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic. Carvedilol, the only beta-adrenergic receptor blocker approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure, has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association Class II or III symptoms. In the U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program, carvedilol's benefit was seen in patients with either ischemic or nonischemic etiologies of heart failure. Similar findings of benefit in both ischemic and nonischemic heart failure have been observed in the recently reported Second Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS II) trial as well as in ACE inhibitor heart failure trials. Studies suggesting differences in outcome based on etiology during pharmacologic treatment of heart failure have been too small (inadequately powered) or have assessed this difference only in post-hoc analyses. Thus, the universal pharmacologic management of heart failure with an ACE inhibitor, diuretic, beta-blocker (e.g. carvedilol), and digoxin may be applied to all patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart failure. This makes sense since the pathophysiology of heart failure following myocardial injury is similar for both forms of the disease.",

Dosage was doubled after 4 weeks when diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mmHg in sitting position, the treatment was continued for 12 weeks. At the end of placebo and active phases a platelet aggregation test, using adenosine diphosphate, collagen and adrenaline, and a platelet malondialdehyde production test, either in basal conditions (MDA-basal) and after the stimulation of arachidonic acid pathway by adding ethylmaleimide (MDA-activated) were carried out.",

Platelet aggregation was reduced by amlodipine in 15.9% for ADP (10 microM); 17.4% for collagen (2 microg/ml) and 19.9% for adrenaline (2 microM) (p < 0.025). Meanwhile enalapril slightly increased platelet aggregation by 6.7%, 1.3% and 5.6% for the three agents, respectively (p > 0.05, ns).

We studied whether chymase bound to heparin, resembling an in vivo form, could contribute to Ang II formation in the presence of natural protease inhibitors.", 
    "649": "The Ang II formation was increased time-dependently after incubation in an extract (1 mg of protein/mL) of human vascular tissues containing Ang I. The concentration of Ang II in the extract after incubation for 30 minutes was 1.67+/-0.06 nmol/mL, and we regarded this quantity of Ang II as 100%. The Ang II formation was inhibited 10%, 95%, and 96% by 1 micromol/L lisinopril, 100 micromol/L chymostatin, and 0.1 g/L alpha-antitrypsin, respectively. The extract was applied to a heparin affinity column. After the column was washed with PBS, the eluted PBS contained a weak Ang II-forming activity, which was completely inhibited by lisinopril. The eluted PBS, to which >0.8 mol/L NaCl had been added, showed a strong Ang II-forming activity which was inhibited by chymostatin and alpha-antitrypsin. After the application of the extract, the column was washed with PBS and then an Ang I solution in PBS was applied to the column. The Ang II formation in the PBS eluted from the incubated column was increased time-dependently. The concentration of Ang II in the PBS (1 mL) eluted from the column after incubation for 30 minutes was 2.56+/-0.28 nmol/mL, and we regarded this quantity of Ang II as 100%. To study the effects of inhibitors, the extract (1 mg of protein/mL) was applied to a heparin affinity column (1 mL) which was preequilibrated with PBS (3 mL); 100 micromol/L chymostatin or 0.1 g/L alpha-antitrypsin in PBS (1 mL) was then applied to the column. After the column was washed with PBS (3 mL), Ang I solution (1 mg/mL) in PBS was applied to the column, and the column was incubated for 30 minutes. The Ang II formation in the PBS eluted from the column was suppressed up to 5% by application of chymostatin, although this was not affected by application of alpha-antitrypsin.",

    "651": "This work was intended to determine which enzymatic activities from crude synaptosomal mammalian brain membranes could qualify for the status of 5-hydroxytryptamine-moduline (5-HT-moduline, LSAL, Leu-Ser-Ala-Leu) inactivating enzymes. An enzymatic assay for 5-HT-moduline metabolism was developed using [3H]5-HT-moduline measurement and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique to identify and quantify 5-HT-moduline metabolites. 5-HT-moduline metabolism displayed all characteristics of metalloprotease activity: sensitivity to divalent ion chelators, reactivation by Zn2+ ions and a pH optimum in the 7-8 range. Bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, allowed the identification of two enzymatic activities responsible for this metabolism: a bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase and an endoprotease cleaving 5-HT-moduline into LS (Leu-Ser) and AL (Ala-Leu) dipeptides. This latter enzyme was shown to have a Km of 37.1 +/- 3.6 microM and a Vmax of 5.5 micromol min(-1) l(-1) per mg of protein. Moreover, this enzyme was insensitive to peptidyl dipeptidase A (angiotensin converting enzyme, EC 3.4.15.1), endothelin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase (neprylisin, EC 3.4.24.11) inhibitors and displayed some specificity among 5-HT-moduline-analogues and in particular recognized only tetrapeptides. These results, together with the isolation of the LS and AL metabolites [Rousselle, J.C., Massot, O., Delepierre, M., Zifa, E., Rousseau, B., Fillion, G., 1996.

In this retrospective analysis of data from the previously published study, patients were classified as either smokers (n = 23) or nonsmokers (n = 82). Patients underwent coronary angiography at baseline and again after 6-month follow-up. The primary response variable was the net change in acetylcholine-induced diameter of the target coronary artery segments (n = 105) between the baseline and 6-month follow-up angiograms. The secondary response variables were based on analysis of all segments (n = 300) and the mean diameter responses of target and all segments at 6 months. At baseline, coronary artery vasomotor responses were similar in smokers and nonsmokers in the placebo and quinapril groups. There was a significant improvement in the primary response variable for both smokers (P = 0.008) and nonsmokers (P = 0.047) randomized to quinapril compared with placebo. At 6-month follow-up, nonsmokers in the placebo group showed no significant change in the mean vasoconstrictor responses (8.3% vs. 8.0% at acetylcholine 10(-4) mol/L), whereas nonsmokers in the quinapril-treated group showed significantly less vasoconstriction (2.7% vs. 13.2%; P = 0.003). Among smokers in the placebo group, vasoconstriction increased nonsignificantly (21.7% vs. 17.2% at baseline) but decreased significantly in the quinapril group (0.5% vs. 17.9%; P = 0.002).

A mutant allele of the ACE gene (Ance) of Drosophila melanogaster is embryonic lethal, indicating an important role for the enzyme in development. We now report the presence of ACE in female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes and that the enzyme is induced by a blood meal. ACE accumulates in developing ovaries and passes into the mosquito eggs, where it may play a role in the metabolism of peptides during embryogenesis. The ovarian ACE has an Mr of 70 kDa and is inhibited by captopril and lisinopril with IC50 values of 0.1 microM and 0.6 microM, respectively.", 
    "670": "Today's healthcare environment is one of perpetual change, increasing costs, and scarce resources. Healthcare professionals, insurers, and consumers are constantly challenged with balancing healthcare costs and quality of life. With so many antihypertensive agents to choose from, therapies that provide benefits beyond the decreasing of blood pressure, will become the preferred therapies. However, these agents must also demonstrate a desirable side-effect profile; agents that are effective but not complied with will neither reduce costs nor improve quality of life. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists have the most favorable adverse event profile of the antihypertensive agents. These drugs may become the preferred agents of physicians who factor indirect costs--less morbidity and greater productivity--into their selection of an antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "671": "It is well known that hypertensive patients can greatly reduce their risk of cardiovascular events by controlling their blood pressure at normal levels. However, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are associated with and preceded by organ damage that can be used as an intermediate endpoint in assessing the benefits of antihypertensive therapy. Contemporary diagnostic techniques--ultrasound, in particular--are making it easier to pinpoint different types of organ damage, and newer antihypertensive agents are demonstrating organ-protective properties independently of their blood-pressure-lowering effects. This article discusses methods of identifying and possibly modifying left ventricular hypertrophy, carotid artery disease, and renal damage, as well as the antihypertensive agents showing organ-protective promise.", 
    "672": "A disturbing pattern in the management of hypertension is emerging worldwide. More patients are being treated for hypertension, but blood pressures are not decreasing to target levels. Inadequate reduction in blood pressure is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. Poor drug efficacy, side effects, and lack of compliance are important factors leading to inadequate control of blood pressure. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists provide adequate 24-hour blood pressure control, as measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and have a side-effect profile similar to placebo. They also provide better patient compliance through once-daily dosing. This article compares the safety and efficacy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "673": "An optimal antihypertensive drug produces superior blood pressure-lowering effects at established dosages, with an acceptably low incidence of side effects, and at a dosage interval that is convenient for patients (ideally, once daily). The angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, meets these criteria. At doses of > or = 40 mg, this once-daily drug produces a statistically significant reduction in blood pressure. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and high trough-peak ratios attest to the smooth, consistent blood pressure-lowering effect of telmisartan at 40- and 80-mg dosages. Telmisartan also demonstrates a statistically superior antihypertensive effect toward the end of the dosing interval compared with amlodipine and losartan, and it has a side-effect profile comparable to that of placebo. In summary, the evidence suggests that telmisartan at dosages of 40 and 80 mg once daily satisfies the 3 criteria of an ideal antihypertensive agent, producing an effective and sustained response with placebo-like tolerability.", 
    "674": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. Angiotensin II is the principal effector hormone in the RAS, causing vasoconstriction and increased sodium and water retention, leading to increased blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists both inhibit the actions of angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors prevent the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, whereas angiotensin II receptor antagonists inhibit the final crucial step of angiotensin II binding with the AT1 receptor site. This article discusses the efficacy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and their possible role in organ protection."
