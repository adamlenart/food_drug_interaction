    "2": "Six patients with an acute drug eruption were identified who had linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Lesional tissue was examined by brightfield microscopy, and perilesional tissue was examined by direct immunofluorescence (DIF). The presence of circulating BMZ antibody was assayed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on monkey esophagus (ME) and salt-split human skin (SS).", 
    "3": "Histopathologic examination showed subepidermal bullae with varying numbers of inflammatory cells. DIF showed linear IgA at the BMZ; three of the patients also had weak deposition of C3 at the BMZ. Serum from five patients was studied by IIF. One patient had circulating IgA BMZ antibodies in a titer of 1:80 on ME, localized to the dermal side on SS. All patients were free of lesions within 5 weeks after discontinuation of the drug.",

    "5": "Ramipril 5 mg once daily was compared to Captopril 50 mg twice daily in a randomised, double-blind, parallel group study in 60 patients with a diastolic blood pressure between 95 to 120 mmHg over a period of 2 months. Both drugs in the dose regimen used in this study exerted a similar anti-hypertensive effect at the end of 2 months of treatment resulting in a fall of supine diastolic blood pressure with Ramipril = 19.27 +/- 3.34 mmHg and Captopril = 19.15 +/- 2.63, in patients receiving the drugs without the diuretic. The mean fall in supine diastolic blood pressure 4 hours after the first dose of Ramipril was 6.5 mmHg and Captopril 8 mmHg. None of the patients developed first dose hypotension or orthostatic hypotension and there was no significant alteration of the heart rate in either group. The serum K+ levels remained unchanged in both groups of patients. Both drugs were well tolerated and there were no adverse effects observed on the liver, kidney, blood sugar or haemopoietic system. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the antihypertensive efficacy of 5 mg ramipril in a once daily dose is equivalent to 50 mg captopril given twice daily. However an appreciably greater number of patients reported improvement in the \"quality of life' parameters with ramipril as compared to captopril. Thus for the routine treatment of mild to moderate arterial hypertension, ramipril offers reliable antihypertensive efficacy in a once daily dose, thereby helping to improve patient compliance and making the treatment more economical.", 
    "6": "We investigated the dose-dependent cardiovascular effects of enalaprilat at different dosing times in two animal models of hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were measured telemetrically in 5 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in 5 transgenic hypertensive rats (TGR) after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of enalaprilat either at 700 h or at 1900 h. In SHR, dosing of enalaprilat at the beginning of the resting period, i.e., at 700 h, significantly reduced BP but did not influence HR. After dosing at 1900 h, BP was unchanged, whereas HR increased, which might have resulted from reflexly increased sympathetic tone. In TGR, enalaprilat at either dosing time decreased BP dose dependently and to a higher extent than in SHR, but the effects were more pronounced after morning than after evening dosing. These findings demonstrate that in two animal models of hypertension the antihypertensive effects of enalaprilat depended on the time of drug dosing.", 
    "7": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been proposed to play a major role in causing the heart to hypertrophy during pressure overload. We examined whether blockade of this system by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enalapril (0.5 to 20 mg/kg p.o.) or ramipril (1.0 mg/kg p.o.) or the angiotensin receptor (AT1) antagonist losartan (3.0 mg/kg p.o.) could prevent pressure overload-induced hypertrophy. Pressure overload was produced by abdominal aortic constriction in rats. Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by an increase in the ratio of left ventricular (LV) weight to body weight and total protein content of the left ventricle. Treatment with enalapril or ramipril, initiated 3 weeks after aortic banding and continued for 3 more weeks, failed to prevent the progression or cause regression of cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment for 6 weeks with ramipril initiated immediately after aortic banding also failed to prevent cardiac hypertrophy. Losartan treatment initiated 3 weeks after aortic banding and continued for 3 more weeks resulted in a slight but significant reduction in the extent of cardiac hypertrophy (45.6% hypertrophy in controls and 35.6% hypertrophy in losartan-treated animals, p < 0.05, n = 11 and 10, respectively). Surgical removal of bands 3 weeks after placement reduced cardiac hypertrophy to a greater extent than that observed in losartan-treated animals. These results suggest that angiotensin may not play a major role in causing pressure overload-induced hypertrophy or in maintaining such hypertrophy.", 
    "8": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have proven to be effective therapeutic agents for treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure (CHF). Because of the role the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays in maintaining renal homeostasis, the effect these compounds have on renal function has been of interest. We assessed the effect of toxicologically significant doses of the new ACE inhibitor, quinapril, on renal function and morphology in dogs. Groups of 3 male beagle dogs were administered quinapril orally at daily doses of 0, 25, 125, or 250 mg/kg for 13 weeks. After treatment, animals were anesthetized and assessed for clinical pathologic and renal functional disturbances under normal conditions and after volume expansion and diuresis. Renal histopathology was conducted on perfusion-fixed kidney. No adverse effects on sensitive measures of renal function were detected; changes observed were consistent with the pharmacologic consequences of ACE inhibition. Decreased serum Na+ and Cl- (< 10%) and hematocrit at 125 and 250 mg/kg, twofold increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 250 mg/kg, and decreased arterial blood pressure (BP) (20%) were observed at all doses. Under baseline conditions, urine flow increased 81-123% in quinapril-treated animals as compared with controls and urine specific gravities decreased 16% relative to controls at 125 and 250 mg/kg. Microscopically, juxtaglomerular hypertrophy was observed at all doses. At 250 mg/kg, minimal, widely scattered cortical tubular alterations were observed; glomerular lesions were not. No significant adverse effects of quinapril on renal morphology or function were observed at doses approximately 250 times the therapeutic dose.", 
    "9": "Unilateral nephrectomy (UNX) is followed by a prompt functional adaptation (as well as initiation of compensatory growth) in the contralateral kidney. We assessed the possibility that dopamine (DA) receptor antagonism and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may influence the acute natriuretic response to UNX of the remaining kidney in euvolemic anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats with or without pretreatment by haloperidol or enalapril. Twenty to 80 min after UNX, urinary excretion of sodium and potassium approximately doubled and fractional excretion of lithium (an index of proximal tubular handling of sodium) increased by about one third in untreated rats, whereas glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow and mean arterial pressure (MAP) did not change significantly. Haloperidol infusion blunted the post-UNX increase in fractional excretion of lithium without affecting the natriuretic/kaliuretic response of the remaining kidney. Enalapril pretreatment resulted in lower MAP and marked renal vasodilation at baseline but no significant alteration in the response to UNX. These results indicate that the magnitude of post-UNX natriuresis is not affected by suppression of angiotensin II (AII) generation or blockade of DA receptors. The lithium clearance data suggest that the immediate natriuretic response to UNX can be ascribed to both a proximal and a distal tubular phenomenon.", 
    "10": "Cyclooxygenase inhibitors may affect the hemodynamic status of patients with heart failure adversely and may also block the vasodilatory effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in such patients. Relatively low doses of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are now used routinely in ischemic heart disease, the most important cause of heart failure. Therefore, we investigated the hemodynamic interaction between ASA and captopril in heart failure. In a randomized, cross-over study, 13 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) who were already receiving maintenance treatment with an ACE inhibitor received a single dose of 25 mg captopril combined with 236 mg ASA or placebo. Peripheral blood flow was studied noninvasively by venous occlusion plethysmography of the calves. Liver blood flow was estimated from indocyanine green (ICG) clearance. Administration of captopril alone significantly decreased blood pressure (BP), and ICG clearance. Calf blood flow remained unchanged. However, after arterial occlusion, hyperemic calf blood flow persisted for longer. Captopril alone did not significantly change the plasma levels of the vasodilating prostaglandins PGI2 and PGE2 or the vasoconstricting thromboxane A2 (TXA2). In contrast, captopril combined with ASA reduced the plasma levels of these vasoactive substances, with significant decreases in PGE2 and TXA2 as compared with captopril alone, yet the hemodynamic alterations after captopril plus ASA were similar to those observed after captopril alone. A single antithrombotic dose of ASA (236 mg) in 13 patients with CHF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV] undergoing chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors had no discernible effect on hemodynamic status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "A stress test was performed before (S1) and after a 1-month treatment period (S2) in patients with essential hypertension, randomly allocated to receive either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), lisinopril (n = 10), or placebo (n = 10). The two groups were similar with regard to systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), body weight, renal function, and 24-h sodium excretion. At S1, stress induced a significant increase in SBP of 18 +/- 9 mm Hg and in DBP of 10 +/- 6 mm Hg and a significant reduction in sodium excretion from 258 +/- 105 to 204 +/- 72 mumol/min. Stress-induced sympathetic stimulation was assessed by a significant increase in urinary norepinephrine (NE) excretion from 21 +/- 10 to 26 +/- 10 micrograms/g creatinine. One-month treatment by placebo did not change stress-induced BP reactivity, sodium retention, or urinary NE excretion. In the lisinopril group, rest and stress BP were significantly reduced by the treatment. Stress-induced sodium retention was higher after 1-month placebo treatment (72 +/- 78 vs 48 +/- 67 mumol/min), whereas this retention was significantly reduced by lisinopril (13 +/- 27 vs 69 +/- 60 mumol/min).", 
    "12": "We attempted to determine the level of sweat kallikrein (kininogenase) and to purify and characterize it using sweat collected over a white petrolatum barrier. Thermally induced eccrine sweat obtained from 24 healthy subjects showed kallikrein activity of 24.4 ng kinins generated/1 mg of sweat protein when heated plasma was used as the substrate and 16.1 ng kinin when purified low molecular weight bovine kininogen was used as the substrate. Sweat was sequentially purified by Sephacryl S-200, diethyaminoethyl Sephacel, and fast flow liquid chromatography Mono Q chromatography. Sweat kallikrein had a M(r) of 40,000 and was inhibited by aprotinin but not by soybean trypsin inhibitor. The peptide generated by sweat kallikrein was identified as lys-bradykinin using reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography and by its amino acid sequence. Anti-human urinary kallikrein immunoglobulin G neutralized the sweat kallikrein activity completely, indicating that the sweat kallikrein is the glandular type. Purified sweat and salivary kallikrein showed similar M(r) and responses to inhibitors and antibodies. Using immunohistochemistry, kallikrein activity was localized in luminal ductal cells and in the peripheral rim of secretory coil segments, presumably the outer membrane of the myoepithelium. We also observed kininase activity in sweat at M(r) 160,000, which was inhibited by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, captopril, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor peptide, indicating that it is kininase II (or angiotensin converting enzyme). Sweat also contains abundant non-kallikrein hydrolases for S-2266 and S-2302. The demonstration of glandular kallikrein, its tissue localization, and the presence of kininase II in sweat provide the basis for future studies on the physiologic role of the kallikrein/kinin system in the eccrine sweat gland.", 
    "13": "Angiotensin-II (AII), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, is the major factor that regulates the formation of aldosterone in the adrenal cortex zona glomerulosa (ZG). The activity of this system is increased by an increase in potassium intake or a decrease in sodium intake. Using immunoblotting analysis, we determined whether these ions affect the expression of type 1 AII receptors (AT1) and compared the results thus obtained with the AT1 receptor mRNA levels. We also studied the interrelation among AII, AT1 receptors, cytochrome P450 aldosterone synthase (P450c18), and plasma aldosterone levels in rats fed a normal diet or a low sodium or high potassium diet with or without captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, for 7 days. The effects of ions on the level of ACTH receptor mRNA were also analyzed. We found that a low sodium intake increased plasma aldosterone levels from 5.5 to 236 ng/dl and led to 2.3- and 3.7-fold increases in the levels of adrenal ZG AT1 receptor protein and AT1 receptor mRNA, whereas a 11.8-fold increase was found in the level of P450c18 mRNA. Captopril almost completely reversed these effects. We have shown that a high potassium intake increased plasma aldosterone levels to 25.9 ng/dl and also led to 1.84- and 1.95-fold increases in the level of ZG AT1 receptor protein and AT1 receptor mRNA, whereas the ZG P450c18 mRNA level was increased 3.5-fold. The plasma aldosterone level of animals fed a high diet of potassium and captopril was still higher than that in control animals at 16.6 ng/dl, and the levels of ZG AT1 receptor and P450c18 mRNAs were only slightly less than those of the high potassium groups, indicating that captopril did not efficiently block aldosterone formation under these conditions. ACTH receptor mRNA levels remain unaffected by either low sodium or high potassium intake. Collectively, these results indicate that the increased aldosterone secretion induced by low sodium or high potassium intake involves concomitant increases in AT1 receptor and P450c18 mRNAs, which are effectively translated into their respective proteins, and that the expression of both proteins is mediated in part by AII.", 
    "14": "Ventricular arrhythmias occur frequently in patients with hypertensive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and have been associated with increased incidence of sudden death. In this study, the effect of various antihypertensive medications on ventricular arrhythmias was evaluated in 31 hypertensive patients with moderate to severe LV hypertrophy. Patients were assessed at baseline (after 3 weeks of placebo treatment) and after treatment with each of 4 monotherapies: diltiazem 120 or 240 mg/day, metoprolol 100 or 200 mg/day, enalapril 10 or 20 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 50 or 100 mg/day. Each drug therapy was administered for 4 weeks. The sequence of each treatment was determined at random. Echocardiographic measurements and electrocardiograms were obtained only at baseline. Biochemical measurements and 48-hour Holter monitoring were obtained at baseline and at the end of each treatment. All treatments resulted in a significant but similar decrease in blood pressure. In the group as a whole diltiazem decreased ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) by 65% (p < 0.05) and metoprolol by 52% (p = 0.07). Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect. In 12 patients with > or = 5 VPCs/hour at baseline, diltiazem and metoprolol decreased VPCs by 66% (p < 0.05). It is concluded that in hypertensive patients with moderate to severe LV hypertrophy, both diltiazem and metoprolol significantly reduce VPCs.",

In a randomized and double-blind cross-over trial the patients received, each time for six weeks, either lisinopril (5 mg/d, sometimes increased to 10 mg/d after 3 weeks) or captopril (twice daily 12.5 mg, sometimes increased to twice 25 mg after 3 weeks). Initially and between the individual treatment phases they were on a placebo phase for 4 weeks. The following were measured: protein excretion, including fractional clearance of albumin and IgG, plasma-renin activity and renal haemodynamics. Protein excretion was not significantly reduced by either drug (placebo: 7.1 +/- 4.0 g/d; lisinopril: 5.1 +/- 2.8 g/d; captopril: 5.4 +/- 3.0 g/d). Albumin excretion and fractional albumin clearance were significantly decreased only by lisinopril (P < 0.05), not by captopril. Plasma-renin activity was increased more by lisinopril than captopril (Placebo: 1.0 +/- 0.9 ng/ml.h; lisinopril: 5.2 +/- 2.8 ng/ml.h [P < 0.05]; captopril: 1.8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml.h [P < 0.05]). The renal haemodynamics was only slightly influenced by either drug, but captopril significantly decreased the filtration fraction in the presence of chronic glomerulonephritis and renal failure. - Resulting from their influence on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ACE inhibitors have, in addition to their known action on renal haemodynamics, an independent effect on the loading barrier of the basal membrane of the kidney.",

Patients had hypertension of WHO grades I-III, with initial mean sitting and standing diastolic blood pressure of 100-119 mm Hg (phase V) after 2-4 weeks on placebo, and had remained uncontrolled (diastolic blood pressure > 95 mm Hg) despite a further 4 weeks on low-dose captopril. Twenty-nine patients entered the computer-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover comparison of either amlodipine 10 mg once daily or matching placebo added to continued therapy with captopril 25 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Patients then acted as their own control and received the alternative amlodipine/placebo treatment plus their continued captopril therapy for another 4 weeks. Once-daily amlodipine was shown to be effective when combined with captopril. Mean baseline supine systolic blood pressure decreased from 167 to 149 mm Hg and standing systolic blood pressure from 167 to 144 mm Hg. Mean supine diastolic blood pressure decreased from 105 to 92 mm Hg, and standing diastolic blood pressure decreased from 110 to 96 mm Hg. The placebo-corrected amlodipine differences in mean changes from captopril baseline were -18/-12.2 mm Hg for supine and -20.1/-11.9 mm Hg for standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively (p < 0.001 for all 4 measurements). The most common side effects encountered with amlodipine were flushing and pedal edema. The combination of amlodipine and captopril was well tolerated, and no patient discontinued therapy.

    "37": "Amyloidosis with renal involvement was diagnosed in a 52-year-old man with Crohn's disease for 15 years. A severe nephrotic syndrome developed (proteinuria 40 g daily) with oedema and arterial hypotension (80/60 mm Hg). As adequate substitution treatment was not possible an attempt at medical renal ablation was made with a combination of captopril (25 mg daily), frusemide (80 mg daily) and indomethacin (200 mg daily). The proteinuria decreased to 18 g daily, but serum creatinine concentration rose to 5.8 mg/dl so that chronic haemodialysis had to be undertaken. Yet the patient's clinical state hardly improved and, because of his poor general condition, bilateral nephrectomy was contraindicated. In consequence bilateral catheter embolization of the renal arteries was performed. The urinary protein loss fell at once to 0.5 g daily. Serum protein rose from 3.1 g/dl under substitution to 5.7 g/dl without. During the following six months, while on chronic haemodialysis, the nephrotic syndrome did not recur. However, cardiac involvement in the amyloidosis was demonstrated so that the prognosis is poor. Permanent bilateral embolization of the renal arteries is a feasible method of managing a treatment-resistant nephrotic syndrome in selected patients.", 
    "38": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an ectoprotein anchored in the plasma membrane through a hydrophobic domain near its carboxyl-terminal region. Mouse epithelial cells transfected with rabbit testicular ACE cDNA, synthesize, glycosylate, and secrete ACE by cleavage processing of its membrane-anchoring carboxyl-terminal region. Because the cleavage-secretion process is slow, the enzyme accumulates on the cell surface. We show that this process can be enhanced by treatment of cells with tumor-promoting phorbol esters leading to depletion of the cell surface enzyme. The cleavage processing occurs only after the protein has reached the cell surface and is not affected by disruption of the Golgi apparatus or the lysosomal compartments. The exact peptide bond cleaved has been identified by sequencing the amino-terminal residues of the purified COOH-terminal tail left in the cells after ACE is secreted and the carboxyl-terminal residues of secreted ACE. The cleavage occurs at a monobasic site between Arg-663 and Ser-664 generating the soluble enzyme and leaving a cell-bound protein of 74 residues. These results demonstrate the existence of cellular mechanisms that regulate the conversion of cell-bound ACE to a soluble enzyme.", 
    "39": "Determination of the X-ray structure of thermolysin-inhibitor complexes has proven useful in aiding our understanding of the mode of binding of inhibitors of related, physiologically important, mammalian zinc peptidases including neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 and angiotensin-converting enzyme. Here we describe the mode of binding to crystalline thermolysin of N-[1-(2(R,S)-carboxy-4-phenylbutyl)-cyclopentylcarbonyl]-(S) -tryptophan (CCT). CCT is an analogue of both candoxatrilat, a potent inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase 24.11, and of the 5-indanyl ester prodrug candoxatril, which is under clinical evaluation as a potential therapy for congestive heart failure. CCT differs from the previously studied N-carboxyalkyl dipeptide CLT [N-(S)-(1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-(S)-leucyl-(S)-tryptophan] in several important respects. It has a highly constrained gem-cyclopentyl P1' substituent and lacks the characteristic imino nitrogen substituent of CLT. The structure determination shows that, notwithstanding the conformational influence of the gem-cyclopentyl substituent, CCT binds within the active site of thermolysin in a similar manner to CLT. Although the characteristic hydrogen bond between the imino nitrogen of CLT and thermolysin is absent in CCT, the affinities of the two inhibitors for the enzyme are virtually identical. These results illustrate the importance of considering not only those hydrogen bonds that are formed in an enzyme-ligand complex but also the other hydrogen bonds that may be lost due to desolvation of the enzyme and ligand on formation of the complex. In addition, the overall conformational demands placed upon a ligand in order to achieve receptor interaction may be critically important.", 
    "40": "We have examined the effects of captopril on pressor responses to the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline in the pithed rat preparation following treatment with phenoxybenzamine and/or nifedipine. Pretreatment with captopril reduced the pressor responses to cirazoline and displaced the dose-response curve for this agonist to the right, significantly increasing the ED50 without altering the maximum response. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine accentuated the inhibitory actions of captopril and a combination of phenoxybenzamine and captopril significantly increased the ED50 without altering the maximum response. Administration of nifedipine in animals, which had already received phenoxybenzamine and captopril, led to a further displacement to the right of the cirazoline dose-response curve. The ED50 was found to be significantly increased and the maximum response was now significantly depressed. Captopril produced further additive inhibition with nifedipine and phenoxybenzamine of the vasoconstrictor effects of cirazoline. These data indicate, perhaps not surprisingly, that the cellular basis for the inhibitory effects of captopril is different from that of nifedipine and phenoxybenzamine, however, more importantly, that captopril may directly, or indirectly, inhibit receptor-operated cation channel mediated pressor responses.",

Perfused gill (arches 2 and 3), perfused skeletal muscle-kidney (via the dorsal aorta; PDA) and perfused splanchnic (via the celiacomesenteric; PCM) circulations vasoconstrict in response to salmonid ANG II in a dose-dependent manner. ANG II was significantly (P&frac34;0.05) more potent in the PCM than in the PDA, and both preparations were more responsive than the gills: pD2=8.0&plusmn;0.20 (10) for PCM; pD2=7.5&plusmn;0.07 (13) for PDA; pD2=6.9 &plusmn;0.21 (8) for gill arch 3; pD2=6.7&plusmn;0.23 (8) for gill arch 2; mean &plusmn; s.e.m. (N), respectively. Salmonid angiotensin I (ANG I) also produced a dose-dependent constriction of the PDA and PCM. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activated nearly 100 % of ANG I to ANG II in a single pass through the PDA, whereas PCM conversion was estimated to be less than 10 %. Inhibitors of adrenergic constriction partially prevented ANG II responses in the PDA but did not affect PCM responses. ANG II did not affect paced rings of ventricular muscle in the presence of high or low [Ca2+] or epinephrine concentrations, nor did it have any inotropic or chronotropic effects in the in situ perfused heart. Red blood cell swelling was unaffected by ANG II. Similarly, the effects of ANG II on gut, urinary bladder and gall bladder smooth muscle were negligible or non-existent; thus, an increase in splanchnic resistance due to extravascular compression can be discounted. These results indicate that, in trout, the systemic microcirculation is the major cardiovascular effector of angiotensin-mediated pressor responses. In addition, the RAS has little direct effect on non-vascular smooth muscle or the heart. From an evolutionary perspective, the initial site of direct systemic RAS action appears to be the vascular microcirculation.", 
    "42": "The objective of the study was to determine if bradykinin-induced airway microvascular leakage in rats was altered by pretreatment of animals with enalaprilat, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), or phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.11 (EP 24.11). We found that the intravascular infusion of bradykinin induced microvascular leakage of Evans blue dye in tracheal tissue (0.088 +/- 0.035 micrograms/mg tissue) that was significantly amplified by pretreatment with 3.27 mM enalaprilat (0.458 +/- 0.226 micrograms/mg tissue), but not by pretreatment with 10 mM phosphoramidon (0.082 +/- 0.0453 micrograms/mg tissue). Leakage in carinal tissue was also amplified by pretreatment with 3.27 mM enalaprilat (0.205 +/- 0.050 vs. 0.036 +/- 0.006 micrograms/mg tissue for bradykinin alone), whereas no amplification was observed in parenchymal tissue by pretreatment with either inhibitor. These findings indicate that in the rat, ACE, but not EP 24.11, modulates bradykinin-induced airway microvascular leakage following intravascular infusion of these agents.", 
    "43": "This study examined the effect of dynamic exercise on vasopressin release in the miniswine and factors that may elicit this response (n = 15). Thus lysine vasopressin (LVP), the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine (EPI and NE), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma volume, Na+, and osmolality were measured before and during treadmill running at work intensities of 60, 80, and 100% of each swine's maximal heart rate reserve (HRR). LVP increased in a progressive manner similar to that of humans, ranging from 5.9 +/- 0.4 pg/ml before exercise to 30.1 +/- 4.5 pg/ml during maximal exercise. EPI, NE, and PRA [an index of angiotensin II (ANG II) activity] demonstrated a pattern of response comparable to LVP. Although these hormones can influence the release of LVP, only PRA displayed a strong correlation with LVP (r = 0.84). When ANG II synthesis was blocked (captopril, 1-3 mg/kg, intra-atrial injection) during exercise (80% HRR), plasma LVP was reduced from 9.9 +/- 0.6 to 7.5 +/- 0.6 pg/ml (P < 0.05). In addition, moderate-to-strong correlations were found between plasma concentrations of LVP and plasma osmolality (r = 0.79) and body temperature (r = 0.78). Plasma LVP also correlated with decreases in plasma volume (r = 0.84). These data suggest that the miniswine model is a good one for studying vasopressin effects during exercise and that ANG II appears to be a particularly strong stimulus for the release of this hormone.", 
    "44": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11), two membrane-bound metalloenzymes that are widely distributed in the peripheral microcirculation and degrade kinins very effectively, modulate bradykinin-induced arteriolar dilation in vivo. Using intravital microscopy, we measured diameter of second-order arterioles in the hamster cheek pouch during suffusion of bradykinin (0.1-10.0 microM) before and after topical application of captopril (10.0 microM) and phosphoramidon (10.0 nM). We found that each inhibitor significantly potentiated bradykinin-induced increase in arteriolar diameter (P < 0.05). Suffusion of other proteinase inhibitors (excluding ACE and NEP inhibitors) had no significant effect on bradykinin-induced responses. Captopril and phosphoramidon did not potentiate isoproterenol (0.1 microM)-induced arteriolar dilation in the cheek pouch. Collectively, these data indicate that ACE and NEP each plays an important role in regulating bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation in the peripheral microcirculation in vivo.", 
    "45": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) has been shown in adults to modulate baroreflex responses in heart rate (HR) and sympathetic outflow. To test the hypothesis that high circulating levels of ANG II in the newborn period contribute to the resetting of the arterial baroreflex observed postnatally, we studied baroreflex-mediated changes in HR and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) before and after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in fetal and newborn sheep. In the newborn, administration of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat produced significant (P < 0.05) decreases in baseline RSNA (69 +/- 5 vs. 47 +/- 7% maximum) and HR (81 +/- 3 vs. 59 +/- 4% max), as well as in the baroreflex curve midpoints for RSNA (93 +/- 4 vs. 87 +/- 3 mmHg) and HR (95 +/- 4 vs. 81 +/- 5 mmHg); no change in the sensitivities (gains) of the baroreflex responses were seen. In contrast, no significant changes in baseline RSNA, HR, baroreflex curve midpoint, or sensitivity were demonstrated in the fetus. Infusion of ANG II in newborn lambs reversed the effects of ACE inhibition on the baroreflex responses. Additional experiments evaluating the effects of ACE inhibition in vagotomized newborns again showed resetting of the baroreflex, demonstrating that vagally mediated mechanisms are not involved in regulating the changes in sympathetic outflow during the neonatal period. These results suggest that endogenous ANG II contributes to the resetting of the baroreflex observed postnatally.", 
    "46": "Factors including complement activation, neutrophil infiltration, and oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of myocardial tissue injury during ischemia and reperfusion. Certain sulfhydryl-containing compounds have been shown to inhibit complement activation. The sulfhydryl compounds captopril and N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (MPG) are antioxidant compounds that previously have been shown to protect the myocardium from ischemia and reperfusion-induced damage. In this study, captopril (an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor; ACEI) and MPG, and the non-sulfhydryl compound enalaprilat (also an ACEI) were tested for their ability to protect the isolated perfused rabbit heart against complement-induced injury. Both captopril and MPG protected hearts against complement-mediated increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and increases in coronary arterial perfusion pressure in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas enalaprilat was not protective. The ability of these compounds to inhibit complement activation also was tested using an in vitro complement-mediated red blood cell hemolysis assay. These findings offer additional insight as to the mechanism whereby captopril, MPG, and possibly other sulfhydryl compounds, may be acting to provide cytoprotection during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.",

White women between 60 and 80 years old with sitting diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) from 95 through 114 mm Hg treated with placebo were evaluated by history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and quality-of-life interview. After double-blind randomization with low-dose atenolol, enalapril, or isradipine, the dose was increased stepwise and hydrochlorothiazide added as needed to achieve goal DBP (less than 90 mm Hg and greater than 10 mm Hg below baseline). During maintenance, patients not at goal were \"stepped up,\" and patients with uncontrolled DBP at maximum dosage were removed from the study. The pretreatment (baseline) blood pressure of the 315 randomized participants averaged 161/100 mm Hg; 92% had been treated previously for hypertension, 15% had diabetes mellitus, 11% smoked, and 38% consumed alcohol.",

Of the 70 patients who did not complete the trial, 42 left because of symptoms and 19 because of uncontrolled DBP. No important, unexpected drug-induced changes in symptoms or blood chemistries were noted. Symptom frequency differed little among the three dosage levels, becoming maximal by the second visit at the same dosage level.",

    "51": "In the present study we characterize key activities of an agent designed to simultaneously inhibit angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). MDL 100,240 is a thioester prodrug of MDL 100,173, which is a potent competitive inhibitor of both ACE and NEP in vitro. MDL 100,240 was shown in an ex vivo study to inhibit both of these enzymes in rat kidney. When administered to anesthetized rats, MDL 100,240 enhanced the effect of infused ANP on blood pressure, diuresis and natriuresis and of infused bradykinin on blood pressure. Moreover, MDL 100,173 and MDL 100,240 inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I. These results indicate that MDL 100,173 and its prodrug, MDL 100,240, produced effects, in vivo, consistent with inhibition of both ACE and NEP.",

Exercise time to the development of 1 mm ST segment depression was not significantly changed with benazepril alone or in combination with nifedipine but was increased with nifedipine from 4.18 (1.8) min to 4.99 (1.6) min (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.28 to 1.34; p < 0.05). There was a significant relation between increase in duration of exercise and resting renin concentration (r = 0.498; p < 0.01). Myocardial ischaemia during daily activity, as assessed by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, was reduced by benazepril and by the benazepril and nifedipine combination.

The combination of benazepril and nifedipine reduced ischaemia of daily activity.", 
    "65": "ACE inhibition has been shown to prevent neointima formation after vascular injury. However, it is not known if this effect is due to a specific inhibition of the renin angiotensin system or to another mechanism such as the accumulation of bradykinin. In order to answer this question we compared the effects of maximal effective doses of cilazapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and ciprokiren, a new renin inhibitor, in guinea pigs. Vascular injury was induced by endothelial denudation of the right carotid artery of guinea pigs treated either by saline (control group), cilazapril (30 mg/kg/day) or ciprokiren (24 mg/kg/day). Twelve days after the ballooning, the guinea pigs were sacrificed, the carotid arteries were perfused fixed and neointima formation was evaluated by quantitative morphometry. Both, ciprokiren and cilazapril prevented neointima formation to the same extent (inhibition by 42 and 49%, respectively, p < 0.05). These results suggest that, in guinea pigs, renin inhibition prevents neointima formation to a similar extent as ACE inhibition. Therefore, ACE inhibitors seem to act in this model by inhibiting the renin angiotensin system and not by other effects such as accumulation of bradykinin.", 
    "66": "We monitored the activity of pulmonary microvascular endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vivo by means of multiple indicator-dilution-type techniques, utilizing three different probes: the hydrolysis of two substrates, [3H]-benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro (BPAP) and [14C]benzoyl-Ala-Gly-Pro (BAGP), and the binding of the inhibitor [3H]RAC-X-65 (RAC), all measured during a single transpulmonary passage in anesthetized rabbits, placed on total heart bypass, so that both systemic and pulmonary circulations were fully supported by means of a two-channel extracorporeal pump. Experiments were performed at pulmonary blood flows (Qb) of 250, 400, 560, and 800 ml/min in control or indomethacin-pretreated rabbits. ACE activity was also compared to that of pulmonary microvascular endothelial-bound 5'-nucleotidase, by measuring the dephosphorylation of its natural substrate 5'-[14C]AMP. We calculated substrate utilization, mean lung transit time (t), and volume of distribution (i.e., central blood volume) of all substrates, as well as inhibitor binding. We also calculated Amax/Km and Bmax products of enzyme mass and kinetic constants for substrates and inhibitor, respectively. As Qb increased, Amax/Km values for all three substrates and Bmax increased linearly, indicating microvascular recruitment. In experiments in which either BPAP and 5'-AMP metabolism or BAGP metabolism and RAC binding were studied concomitantly, a linear relationship was observed between Qb-induced changes in Amax/Km values of BPAP vs 5'-AMP as well as in Amax/Km of BAGP vs Bmax of RAC. Similarly, increasing Qb increased central blood volume and decreased t. Indomethacin had no effect on most of the hemodynamic or enzyme parameters measured. We conclude that in vivo assays of ACE proceed as predicted by Michaelis-Menten kinetics and offer insights into pulmonary endothelial pathophysiology.", 
    "67": "We investigated the early effects of radiation on pulmonary endothelial function in vivo 7-8 hr after exposure of rabbits to a single dose of 30 Gy to the chest. Utilizing multiple indicator-dilution techniques, we measured rates and kinetics of hydrolysis of the synthetic substrates [3H]benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro (BPAP) and [14C]benzoyl-Ala-Gly-Pro (BAGP) by endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and of 5'[14C]-AMP by endothelial-bound 5'-nucleotidase (NCT) and binding of the synthetic ACE inhibitor [3H]RAC-X-65 during a single transpulmonary passage in anesthetized, artificially ventilated, open-chest rabbits in which both systemic and pulmonary circulations were fully supported by an extracorporeal pump. We have shown that these techniques and the use of the aforementioned probes provide reliable information on pulmonary endothelial function in vivo. Radiation to the chest produced endothelial ectoenzyme dysfunction, as reflected in altered available perfused capillary surface area and altered enzyme kinetics of all probes (decreases in substrate hydrolysis, inhibitor binding, first- and second-order kinetic constants) over a wide range of pulmonary blood flow values (reflecting approximately 60-200% of normal cardiac output). Indomethacin prevented most of these alterations in partially as well as fully recruited lungs. We conclude that impairment of endothelial ectoenzyme activity is an early event in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced lung damage, which occurs independently of hemodynamic influences and may involve synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites.", 
    "68": "Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) was performed in a patient with bilateral renal artery stenoses diagnosed noninvasively by captopril renal scintigraphy and confirmed by renal arteriography. The captopril renal scintigraphy parameters returned to normal in correlation with improved blood pressure response fifteen days after PTRA. Five months later hypertension reappeared and the repeated captopril renal scintigraphy suggested left renal artery stenosis. PTRA was repeated and a stent was implanted with reversal of blood pressure, and captopril renal scintigraphy findings returned to normal levels. Six months after second PTRA, the blood pressure increased to hypertensive levels, and captopril renal scintigraphy indicated left renal artery stenosis. The renal arteriography, however, revealed a new stenosis at the left renal artery ostium. The PTRA with a second stent implantation was performed successfully. The captopril renal scintigraphic parameters and the blood pressure were again normalized after the last intervention and remained normal for thirteen months of follow-up.", 
    "69": "The present study was conducted to evaluate whether captopril prevents the organomegaly and accumulation of matrix proteins that normally accompanies the diabetic state. The following groups of rats were studied: normal rats, normal rats treated with captopril (30 mg/kg/d orally), streptozotocin diabetic rats, and diabetic rats treated with captopril. All rats were killed at 10 weeks for histologic and morphometric evaluation of tissues. Compared with the normal rats, the diabetic rats demonstrated significant hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, and cardiomegaly, and the increase in organ size was directly related to increasing levels of protein glycosylation. The development of organomegaly was partially prevented by captopril. We determined by morphometry that the hepatomegaly seen in the diabetic rats was due to an increase in cell size and number, while the nephromegaly seen in the diabetic rats was due to an increase in tubular and glomerular cell size and is associated with glomerular hypertrophy. Captopril prevented the development of hepatic and renal cell hypertrophy and glomerular hypertrophy. These effects of captopril were not associated with detectable changes in body weight or levels of glucose, protein glycosylation, glycosuria, or renal histologic changes secondary to glycosuria. The diabetic rats demonstrated significant glomerular mesangial matrix expansion, and captopril treatment partially prevented that expansion. In conclusion, captopril prevents, in part, the development of organomegaly in diabetic rats, and this effect is due mainly to the prevention of the development of cellular hypertrophy. The present findings are most consistent with a direct effect of captopril on cell metabolism during diabetes mellitus.", 
    "70": "Secondary causes of hyperlipidemia are important to recognize. In fact, hyperlipidemia may be a clue to the presence of an underlying systemic disorder. It may greatly heighten the risk of atherosclerosis with a raised LDL-c, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein excess, and increased lipoprotein(a) as well as lowered HDL-c. The search for secondary causes may provide a clue as to why patients with primary lipid disorders suddenly develop worsening lipid profiles. The point is a crucial one because some acquired causes of hyperlipidemia, such as alcohol, estrogens, steroids, or pregnancy, when superimposed on a primary familial form of hypertriglyceridemia can result in a saturated removal system and a buildup of chylomicrons, which can lead to life-threatening pancreatitis. A convenient way to remember secondary causes is to think of the four D's of diet, drugs, disorders of metabolism, and diseases. Although diets rich in saturated fats and cholesterol are a common cause of the mild hypercholesterolemia seen in our society, alcohol excess and weight gain can explain much of the tendency toward hypertriglyceridemia. Interestingly anorexia nervosa has long been associated with severe but reversible hypercholesterolemia. Several classes of drugs need to be considered as common causes of altered lipid profiles. Glucocorticoids and estrogens elevate triglycerides and raise levels of HDL-c. Anabolic steroids taken orally markedly reduce levels of HDL-c in contrast to injectable testosterone, which does not adversely affect the LDL-to-HDL ratio. Oral contraceptives affect atherosclerotic risk depending on the kind and doses of progestin/estrogen. In those with an underlying primary hypertriglyceridemia and associated obesity, estrogenic medications can depress triglyceride removal mechanisms, leading to the chylomicronemia syndrome and pancreatitis. Antihypertensives have variable effects on lipids and lipoproteins. Although short-term thiazide usage raises cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-c, long-term usage is not necessarily associated with significant alterations in lipid levels. Alpha blockers may cause an increase in HDL-c, whereas beta blockers raise triglycerides and lower HDL-c. Sympatholytics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are essentially lipid neutral. Retinoids can be associated with increased LDL-to-HDL ratios and occasionally striking elevations in triglycerides. Cyclosporine raises LDL-c and lipoprotein(a). Classes of drugs that may raise HDL-c include cimetidine, antiepileptic drugs, and tamoxifen, but the effect may be seen primarily in women. Hypothyroidism is the most common secondary cause of hyperlipidemia after dietary causes are considered. A thyroxine and TSH level should be obtained on all new cases of clinically important hyperlipidemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) promotes growth of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. Consistent with this, Ang II enhances neointimal proliferation in vivo after vascular injury, while angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors attenuate this process. Since tissue ACE plays a key role in the control of local Ang II production, we examined whether vascular injury resulted in an increase in vascular ACE expression that may result in increased Ang II production. Abdominal aorta of Sprague-Dawley rats were injured with a 2 French balloon catheter. Morphometrical changes, ACE enzymatic activity, and localization of ACE by immunohistochemistry in injured and uninjured aorta were analyzed. Vascular ACE activity in the injured aorta was significantly higher than in the uninjured aorta, while serum and lung ACE levels were not different between the two groups. The cellular distribution of the ACE protein in the neointima was similar to that of alpha smooth muscle actin but differed from those of endothelial (von Willebrand factor) or monocytes/macrophages (ED-1) markers, demonstrating that ACE was expressed in neointimal smooth muscle cells. These data demonstrate that vascular injury results in the induction of vascular ACE and suggest that the inhibition of vascular ACE may be important in the prevention of restenosis after balloon injury.", 
    "72": "The present study was undertaken to assess the role of ovarian renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the preovulatory cascade induced by gonadotropin exposure. In the in vitro perfused rabbit ovaries, exposure to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) enhanced the secretion rate of angiotensin II (Ang II) within 1 h. The secretion rate reached maximal levels at 6 h and then declined thereafter. The intrafollicular Ang II content and renin-like activity were also significantly increased at 2 and 4 h after exposure to hCG, compared with control ovaries perfused with medium alone. The level of intrafollicular Ang II after hCG exposure significantly exceeded the concentration of Ang II in an equivalent volume of plasma. The addition of 1 microM captopril to the perfusate significantly inhibited the secretion rate of Ang II stimulated by hCG; however, captopril affected neither the ovulatory efficiency nor prostaglandin production in ovaries treated with hCG. Captopril significantly inhibited the resumption of meiosis in the ovulated ova and follicular oocytes stimulated by hCG. The administration of 100 micrograms Ang II at 2-h intervals to the perfusate reversed the inhibitory effects of captopril on hCG-induced oocyte maturation. In conclusion, these data indicate that gonadotropin stimulates renin-like activity and Ang II production in the rabbit ovary. Ovarian renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in the process of oocyte maturation after exposure to gonadotropin.", 
    "73": "We investigated the acute and chronic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril or enalapril) and of angiotensin II receptor blockade (DuP 753) on rapid (30-minute) baroreceptor resetting elicited by a prompt and sustained hypertensive response provoked by aortic constriction. Pressure-nerve activity curves, pressure at 50% of maximal baroreceptor activity, baroreceptor gain (slope of the curve), and systolic threshold pressure for baroreceptor activation were determined as indexes of baroreceptor function. A slight fall in mean arterial pressure after acute treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor or DuP 753 was accompanied by a partial leftward curve shift, which is associated with a partial threshold shift and increase in gain. A maintained hypertensive stimulus caused a partial rightward curve shift and partial (49% to 56%) threshold shift to hypertensive levels in both acutely treated and control rats. The hypertensive stimulus provoked a partial rightward curve shift and complete (88% to 94%) threshold shift to hypertensive levels in chronically treated rats. The effect of enalapril on baroreceptor function was unaltered by the bradykinin antagonist Hoe 140. These data demonstrate that chronic inhibition of converting enzyme or blockade of angiotensin II receptors facilitates rapid resetting of the baroreceptors to hypertensive levels caused by partial aortic constriction without a change in baroreceptor sensitivity.",

Arterial pressure was markedly reduced after both acute (15-minute) treatment with captopril (123 +/- 6 versus 184 +/- 23 mm Hg) and DuP 753 (140 +/- 10.5 versus 181 +/- 5.4 mm Hg), but the depressed baroreceptor reflex bradycardia increased only after DuP 753 (1.13 +/- 0.22 versus 0.75 +/- 0.60 beats per minute [bpm]/mm Hg) and remained attenuated after captopril (0.54 +/- 0.086 versus 0.30 +/- 0.07 bpm/mm Hg). After a 2-day treatment, captopril reduced arterial pressure (95 +/- 5 versus 184 +/- 2.3 mm Hg) to lower levels than DuP 753 (119 +/- 6 versus 172 +/- 4.6 mm Hg), whereas the depressed baroreceptor reflex bradycardia remained unchanged with captopril (0.46 +/- 0.13 versus 0.31 +/- 0.076 bpm/mm Hg) and increased with DuP 753 (1.13 +/- 0.19 versus 0.38 +/- 0.12 bpm/mm Hg).

    "75": "To study the oxytocic effect of trypsin, we measured the force of isometric contraction in uteri isolated from estrogenized rats exposed to trypsin (8.8 x 10(-10) to 1.7 x 10(-6) mol/L) either alone or in the presence of receptor antagonists to angiotensin II [saralasin ([Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II) or DuP 753 (losartan)] or to kinins (D-[Arg0,Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin). We found that saralasin or DuP 753, but not the kinin antagonist, displaced the dose-response curve to the right. Exposure to exogenous angiotensin I desensitized the preparation to further doses of either angiotensin I or II or trypsin, without altering the effects of oxytocin or bradykinin. Enalaprilat (an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor) or pepstatin A (a renin inhibitor) also displaced the dose-response curve to trypsin to the right, without altering the effects of oxytocin or angiotensin II. Our results indicate that the response to trypsin is mediated by an agent produced from a substrate present in the uterus and acting on the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and are consistent with both renin and angiotensin I converting enzyme being involved in its mechanism of action, thus supporting the notions that the renin-angiotensin system may be important in the late stages of pregnancy and that serine proteases existing in the uterus may contribute to its activation.", 
    "76": "N-[1-(R,S)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate (cFP-AAF-pAB), an active-site-directed inhibitor of metalloendopeptidase-24.15, has been shown to lower blood pressure, increase cardiac output and renal blood flow, and potentiate the intravenous bradykinin-induced vasodepressor response. Because in vivo cFP-AAF-pAB can be converted to N-[1-(R,S)-carboxyl-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala (a compound with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory activity) by metalloendopeptidase-24.11, it is possible that some of its effects are due to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. In the present study, we questioned (1) whether cFP-AAF-pAB inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme in vivo and (2) whether cFP-AAF-pAB has renal effects that are independent of its conversion to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. cFP-AAF-pAB alone (3 mumol in 300 microL per rat) almost abolished the blood pressure response to angiotensin I, suggesting that in vivo it inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme. In rats pretreated with a high dose of enalaprilat (1 mg/kg), cFP-AAF-pAB had no further effect on blood pressure, renal blood flow, or potentiation of the vasodepressor response to bradykinin but still increased glomerular filtration rate by 44 +/- 9% (P < .01); urine volume increased by 118 +/- 10% (P < .001), urinary sodium excretion by 230 +/- 31% (P < .001), urinary potassium excretion by 68 +/- 14% (P < .01), and urinary cyclic GMP by 55 +/- 18% (P < .01). All of these changes were significant compared with enalaprilat/vehicle-treated rats. Fractional excretion of sodium and potassium did not differ from controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "In the present study, we evaluated the renal response to a 4-hour infusion of amino acids in essential hypertensive patients, as well as the effects that dietary sodium restriction and enalapril (a converting enzyme inhibitor) had on this renal response. During normal sodium intake, amino acid infusion significantly increased renal plasma flow from 383 +/- 58 to 478 +/- 51 mL/min and glomerular filtration rate from 82 +/- 8 to 100 +/- 13 mL/min. All these effects were abolished when the patients received a low sodium diet (40 mmol/d) for 3 days before the amino acid infusion. The administration of enalapril to the patients during sodium restriction restored the amino acid-induced increment in renal plasma flow (from 388 +/- 35 to 573 +/- 48 mL/min) and glomerular filtration rate (from 88 +/- 9 to 103 +/- 10 mL/min). Mean arterial pressure remained unaltered under all experimental conditions. The results show that in patients with essential hypertension dietary sodium restriction prevents amino acid-induced increments in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow and that this effect is restored during the simultaneous administration of enalapril.",

After a 4- to 5-week placebo lead-in period, 67 mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients (seated diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 and < or = 110 mm Hg) were randomized in a double-blind fashion into four parallel treatment groups: 20 mg fosinopril plus 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, 20 mg fosinopril, 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, and placebo during 8 weeks. Patients were seen biweekly. Sitting diastolic blood pressure was the outcome variable defining therapeutic response. The efficacy of fosinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide as a combined therapy was superior to any single drug (P < .05) and placebo (P < .01) in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. Mean adjusted systolic/diastolic blood pressure decrements at week 8 were -18.8/-13.7, -12.9/-11.8, -8.5/-9.3, and -2.7/-6.9 mm Hg for the fosinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide, fosinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and placebo groups, respectively.

    "79": "Apart from lowering blood pressure, antihypertensive drugs may influence vessel wall function. In a randomized double-blind study, the effect of lisinopril and metoprolol on arterial distensibility was studied in 40 patients with essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period, the patients were randomly treated with metoprolol (50, 100, or 200 mg) or lisinopril (5, 10, or 20 mg) for 10 weeks. In the lisinopril group, blood pressure decreased after 10 weeks of therapy from 173 +/- 10/102 +/- 5 to 155 +/- 10/85 +/- 3 mm Hg and in the metoprolol group from 167 +/- 12/102 +/- 4 to 153 +/- 8/84 +/- 3 mm Hg. Diameter (millimeters), relative change in diameter (percent), and distensibility (10(-3)/kPa) of the left common carotid artery were determined after the placebo run-in period and after 6 and 10 weeks of antihypertensive therapy. A multigate Doppler system was used to measure the vessel wall movements by Doppler analysis in M-mode; blood pressure was recorded by finger plethysmography (Finapres). Neither lisinopril nor metoprolol influenced the end-diastolic diameter of the common carotid artery after 6 and 10 weeks of treatment. In the lisinopril group, a significant increase of percent change in diameter (P < .05 compared with the baseline value; P < .05 compared with the metoprolol group) and distensibility (P < .01 compared with the baseline value; P < .05 compared with the metoprolol group) was observed. The results show that lisinopril but not metoprolol improves arterial distensibility in essential hypertension. Pressure-independent effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be important modulators of adaptive changes in the arterial wall.", 
    "80": "We performed experiments to test the hypothesis that endogenous adenosine acts as an essential cofactor required for eliciting angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced afferent and/or efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Enalaprilat (2 mg IV) was administered to anesthetized rats to reduce endogenous Ang II levels. Kidneys and blood were harvested from these animals and used for study of renal microvascular function using the in vitro blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron technique. Arteriolar inside diameter was monitored videomicroscopically in (1) normal kidneys, (2) kidneys subjected to adenosine receptor blockade (100 mumol/L 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine), and (3) kidneys continuously exposed to 1 mumol/L adenosine. Under resting conditions, arteriolar diameters were similar in all three groups of kidneys, averaging 24.8 +/- 1.0 microns (n = 23) in afferent arterioles and 24.0 +/- 0.9 microns (n = 16) in efferent arterioles. In normal kidneys, adenosine (10 mumol/L) decreased both afferent (10.2 +/- 2.0%) and efferent (6.5 +/- 0.8%) diameters, an effect that was absent in kidneys subjected to adenosine receptor blockade. Ang II (10 pmol/L to 100 nmol/L) elicited dose-dependent vasoconstriction of both vascular segments in normal kidneys. At a concentration of 100 nmol/L, Ang II decreased afferent diameter by 36.8 +/- 8.5% and efferent diameter by 30.8 +/- 9.6%. Neither afferent nor efferent arteriolar Ang II dose-response relations were significantly different in kidneys treated with low-dose adenosine or the adenosine receptor blocker. These observations refute the hypothesis that a receptor-mediated action of adenosine is required for Ang II-induced constriction of juxtamedullary afferent or efferent arterioles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

To determine the effect of unilateral renal artery stenosis, captopril, renal ischemia, and partial renal vein occlusion on renal blood flow and the extraction fraction of [131I]orthoiodohippurate, 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine, and [125I]iothalamate, we conducted a series of constant infusion studies in Sprague-Dawley rats. Renal artery flow reduction of approximately 70% decreased the extraction fraction of all three agents (P < or = .05). Captopril had no effect on extraction fraction in controls, but it produced a further decrease in extraction fraction of 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine and [131I]orthoiodohippurate in rats with renal artery stenosis (P < or = .05). Ischemia resulted in a 16% decrease in flow (P < .01) but a much larger (47% to 65%) decrease in extraction fraction of all three agents (P < .002). Partial renal vein occlusion also decreased the extraction fraction of all three agents (P < or = .05). The changes in extraction fraction imply that the clearances of [131I]orthoiodohippurate and 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine in disease states may not be proportional to renal plasma flow. Furthermore, in rats with renal artery stenosis it appears that renal blood flow must fall below a critical threshold of approximately 58% before extraction fraction decreases; as renal blood flow is further reduced below this threshold, there is a corresponding reduction in extraction fraction (P < .01).",

At 1 year of treatment blood pressure was 131 +/- 4/85 +/- 2 and 132 +/- 2/87 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. Resistance arteries (200 to 400 microns lumen diameter) dissected from subcutaneous gluteal biopsies obtained before treatment and at 1 year showed that the media-lumen ratio of arteries from patients treated with cilazapril was reduced to 6.31 +/- 0.21% from 7.54 +/- 0.31% before treatment (P < .05), still slightly but significantly larger (P < .05) than the media-lumen ratio of resistance arteries of normotensive control subjects (5.15 +/- 0.30%). In contrast, in arteries from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change with treatment (7.97 +/- 0.60% before and 8.07 +/- 0.45% after 1 year of treatment). Active wall tension responses to endothelin-1 were blunted in hypertensive patients and normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients.

We examined the renal and endocrine responses to the renin inhibitor enalkiren, to captopril, and to placebo in nine healthy and nine hypertensive men on a 10-mmol sodium diet. Ang II was infused to assess effects of the agents on renal and adrenal responsiveness to Ang II. Plasma Ang II concentration was suppressed similarly with enalkiren and captopril--an identical level of blockade was achieved. Although renal plasma flow was stable during placebo, a substantial rise was seen with both enalkiren (+133 +/- 26 mL/min per 1.73 m2) and captopril (+99.4 +/- 22.6). There was remarkable intrasubject concordance between the renal plasma flow responses to renin inhibition and converting enzyme inhibition (r = .90, P < .004). The vasodilator response to both agents correlated inversely with the fall in renal plasma flow induced by Ang II alone (r = -.66, P < .05). Both agents significantly enhanced the renal vascular response to Ang II (P = .01), and, furthermore, the renal vasodilator response to captopril predicted the potentiation of the renal plasma flow response to Ang II after either agent (enalkiren: r = .91, P < .001; captopril: r = .56, P < .05). Concordance of the maximal renal plasma flow response to the two agents appeared in the hypertensive men as well.

    "85": "We have recently shown that treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine may aggravate albuminuria and glomerular injury in rats with two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertension if arterial blood pressure is not reduced. To test whether nitrendipine also exerts its adverse renal effects when normotension is achieved, we examined the effect of combined therapy with nitrendipine and the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney. Rats treated with enalapril alone or in combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide or rats treated with nitrendipine alone served as controls. Therapy was started 6 weeks after clipping of one renal artery. Nitrendipine alone did not reduce blood pressure but significantly increased albuminuria, diuresis, glomerular filtration rate, and glomerular volume and injury compared with untreated hypertensive controls. Increase of glomerular filtration rate, diuresis, and albuminuria was reversible after withdrawal of nitrendipine. Treatment with enalapril alone decreased blood pressure significantly but not to normotensive levels and was without significant effect on albuminuria and glomerular morphology. The combination of nitrendipine and enalapril reduced blood pressure to normotensive levels and not only prevented the increase of glomerular volume, glomerular filtration rate, diuresis, and albuminuria caused by nitrendipine alone but furthermore improved glomerular injury and albuminuria to levels not significantly different from normotensive controls. Enalapril in combination with the diuretic had similar beneficial effects on blood pressure, albuminuria, and glomerular injury. These data demonstrate that the adverse effects of nitrendipine monotherapy on glomerular structure and function can be prevented by the combination of nitrendipine and enalapril when blood pressure is normalized.",

Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or captopril, and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events consisting of cardiovascular death, heart failure requiring either hospitalization or open-label angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, and recurrent infarction were determined over a follow-up period averaging 3.0 +/- 0.6 years. Irrespective of treatment assignment, baseline left ventricular systolic area and percent change in area were strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality and adverse cardiovascular events. At 1 year, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic areas were larger in the placebo than in the captopril group (P = .038, P = .015, respectively), and percent change in cavity area was greater in the captopril group (P = .005). One hundred eleven of the 420 1-year survivors with 1-year echo measurements (26.4%) experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event, and these patients had more than a threefold greater increase in left ventricular cavity areas than those with an uncomplicated course.

    "89": "A comprehensive review of physiological and molecular biological evidence refutes claims for synthesis of renin by cardiac and vascular tissues. Cardiovascular tissue renin completely disappears after binephrectomy. Residual putative reninlike activity, where investigated, has had the characteristics of lysosomal acid proteases. Occasional reports of renin or renin mRNA in vascular and cardiac tissues can be ascribed to failure to remove the kidneys 24 hours beforehand, overloading of detection systems, problems with stringency in identification, and illegitimate transcripts after more than 25 cycles of polymerase chain reaction. Others, using more stringent criteria, have failed to detect cardiac and vascular renin mRNA. Accordingly, a growing number of investigators have concluded that the kidneys are the only source of cardiovascular tissue renin. Although prorenin is secreted from extrarenal tissues as well as from the kidneys, there is no evidence that it is ever converted to renin in the circulation. The kidney is the only tissue with known capacity to convert prorenin to renin and to secrete active renin into the circulation. Accordingly, renin of renal origin determines plasma and hence, extracellular fluid renin levels. In these loci, angiotensin (Ang) I, formed by renin cleavage of circulating and interstitial fluid angiotensinogen, is in turn cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme, located in plasma and extracellular fluids and on the luminal surface of pulmonary and systemic vascular endothelial cells, to Ang II, which perfuses and bathes the heart and vasculature. Consistent with this model, plasma renin and angiotensin and the antihypertensive action of renin inhibitors, converting enzyme inhibitor, or Ang II antagonists all disappear after binephrectomy. Thus, the plasma renin level, via Ang II formation, determines renin system vasoconstrictor activity, the antihypertensive potential of anti-renin system drugs, and the risk of heart attack in hypertensive patients. This analysis redirects renin research to renal mechanisms that create the plasma renin level, to renal prorenin biosynthesis and its processing to renin, and to their regulated secretion, extracellular distribution, and possible binding to by target tissues. In this context, it is still possible that changes in circulating and interstitial renin substrate or available converting enzyme might exert subtle modulating influences on Ang II formation. However, this analysis redefines the importance of plasma renin measurements to assess clinical situations, because plasma renin is the only known initiator driving the cardiovascular renin-angiotensin system, and its strength can be measured.",

This produced a sustained contraction in preparations from SHR but not WKY rats. A similar contraction in aortic ring preparations from the SHR was produced with methylene blue (10(-5) M) and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (10(-5) M). The NOLA-induced contraction was reversed with indomethacin (8 x 10(-6) M), ridogrel (10(-5) M) and SQ 29548 (10(-6) M) thus confirming the involvement of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 processes. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the thromboxane-like contraction was not dependent upon the presence of endothelial cells and occurred in preparations from young, prehypertensive (5 week) and older (17 week) SHRs. The thromboxane-like contraction was markedly suppressed with chronic captopril treatment and reinstated 4 weeks after withdrawal from captopril. The addition of saralasin (10(-6) M) or captopril (10(-6) M) to aortic ring preparations did not suppress the thromboxane-like contractions. The foregoing findings support the presence of a nonendothelial cell thromboxane-like constrictor agent in the aorta of the SHR that is revealed after impairment of nitric oxide production.

This may be due to the lack of standardization and the small number of blood pressure measurements in some studies. However, even 24-h blood pressure monitoring can explain only around 25% of the variation in left ventricular mass, and repeated blood pressure measurements over 30 years have not proved better in this respect. Therefore, other factors have been considered, including anthropometric and demographic characteristics; genetic influences; differences in salt intake, physical activity and alcohol consumption; neurohumoral factors; duration of hypertension; and previous antihypertensive treatment. Antihypertensive treatment may reduce left ventricular mass and a number of prospective, randomized, comparative studies have assessed whether some (classes of) drugs are more effective than others. A meta-analysis of such studies, comparing diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, suggests that the reduction of left ventricular mass with each of these classes is similar to the reduction obtained with the other three classes statistically combined. Of particular interest is the observation that the four studies which specifically compared an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist concluded that their effects on left ventricular mass did not significantly differ.

The QoL evaluation introduced a qualitative self-structured subjective measure in addition to prestructured quantitative measures. The quality of life was assessed at baseline, after 6 months and at the end of the study. Methyldopa normalized DBP in 50% of patients when given as monotherapy and an additional 34% with the addition of captopril (84% total). With placebo, 36% normalized DBP and another 39% on addition of captopril (75% total) and, with isradipine, 64% normalized DBP and an additional 26% with added captopril (90% total). Assessment of QoL showed that both the placebo and the isradipine+captopril groups showed significant improvement in semantic memory after antihypertensive treatment. The isradipine+captopril group showed a clear tendency towards lower depression scores, better quality of sleep, better subjective evaluation of QoL and a more positive evaluation of personal life events in comparison to the other groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "105": "The antihypertensive effect of isradipine was studied in 45 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean age 59 years) using casual and ambulatory 24-h blood pressure measurement. Patients were included into the study according to their casual blood pressure. Isradipine was started at a dose of 1.25 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, and increased to 2.5 mg twice daily if casual blood pressure was not normalized. If necessary, 3 mg of spirapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, (n = 1) or 5 mg of pindolol (n = 1) was added. The active-treatment period lasted 24 weeks. At the end of the therapy, casual blood pressure was significantly decreased (p < 0.001) from 173/103 to 150/86 mmHg, and mean ambulatory blood pressure, from 146/87 to 140/83 mmHg (p < 0.05). When patients were divided into three groups according to initial whole-day ambulatory blood pressure values (group I: < 140/90 mmHg; group II: > or = 140/90 mmHg; group III: > or = 140/<90 mmHg), no effect of treatment was detected in group I. However, whole-day blood pressure fell significantly (p < 0.001) in group II (155/96 vs 143/88 mmHg) as did systolic blood pressure (p < 0.01) in group III (150/83 vs 142/81 mmHg), whereas diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. Thus, ambulatory blood pressure measurement may be superior to casual measurement in the decision-making process to treat hypertension, avoiding not only the phenomenon of 'white-coat hypertension', but also ineffective treatment. This conclusion, however, should be confirmed by prospective studies.", 
    "106": "The declining mortality due to coronary artery disease and stroke has been attributed in part to improved effectiveness and application of antihypertensive therapy, and successful identification and treatment of the population at risk. In striking contrast, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) attributed to hypertension has increased annually for the last decade and will probably worsen through the year 2000. Taken together, patients with diabetic nephropathy and those with hypertensive renal disease account for the majority of new cases annually. The reasons for the striking dissociation between the success with coronary artery disease and stroke on the one hand and the inability to lessen the incidence of ESRD remain to be clarified. Evidence reveals that all levels of untreated hypertension are associated with potentially declining renal function. Data from the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program and other studies suggest that antihypertensive treatment can prevent or retard development of progressive renal failure. No data are readily available on repeated measurement of glomerular filtration rate during prolonged treatment of mild hypertension in patients with normal or near-normal renal function. Although the importance of blood pressure control is implicit, a theoretical framework based on data derived from experimental animals suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists may exert specific renoprotective effects beyond those achieved by blood pressure reduction per se. The results of two recent long-term prospective studies support such a formulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "107": "The influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition of hemodynamic changes, development of postinfarction myocardial hypertrophy and left ventricular performance was studied in rats. Infarction was produced under ether anaesthesia by ligature of the descending anterior branches of the left coronary artery. Control rats were submitted to a sham surgery. Groups of infarcted (Inf) and sham-operated control (SO) animals were daily treated with intraperitoneal injections of captopril (Cap, 30 mg kg-1) or saline (Sal) for 4-5 weeks. This Cap dose produced a similar decrease in arterial blood pressure in Inf and SO animals. The intraventricular pressures measured in anaesthetized rats showed a marked elevation in the right ventricular systolic (38 +/- 4 mmHg) and end diastolic (4 +/- 1 mmHg) pressures in the Inf group compared with the SO group (24 +/- 1 mmHg and 1 +/- 0.4 mmHg, respectively). Cap did not change the pressure overload in the right ventricle. In the left ventricle, however, the end diastolic pressure of the Inf group under Cap was significantly reduced in relation to Sal (12 +/- 3 mmHg and 19 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.05). The post infarction myocardial hypertrophy was depressed by Cap only in the right heart chambers. Thus the right ventricular weight to body weight ratio (mg/g) increased from 0.56 +/- 0.03 in the SO-Sal group to 0.96 +/- 0.07 (P < 0.05) in the Inf-Sal group and decreased to 0.73 +/- 0.04 (P < 0.05) in the Inf group under Cap. The infarction-induced hypertrophy of the left heart chambers was unaffected by Cap. Left ventricular function was assessed in the hearts perfused in vitro according to the Langendorff technique. The peak isovolumic systolic pressure (ISP) developed at different diastolic pressures (0-30 mmHg) and Ca2+ concentrations (0.62 and 1.25 mM) was measured. The ISP and the positive inotropic response to Ca2+ was similarly depressed in both groups of infarcted hearts. Thus the chronic administration of Cap to Inf rats reduces the left ventricular filling pressure but does not reduce the postinfarction pulmonary hypertension. Despite this latter finding, Cap therapy was able to significantly reduce the post-infarction hypertrophy in both right heart chambers. Cap therapy did not change significantly left ventricular systolic function and Ca2+ responsiveness of the myocardium surviving to infarction.",

Plasma levels of YM-21095 after 3 mg kg-1 intravenous dosing to dogs declined biphasically and fitted a two-compartment model. Kinetics were as follows: t1/2 alpha = 4.9 +/- 0.2 min, t1/2 beta = 2.76 +/- 0.79 h, Vdss = 3.86 +/- 1.04 L kg-1, plasma clearance = 2.22 +/- 0.39 L kg-1, and AUC = 1445 +/- 266 ng h mL-1. After 30 mg kg-1 oral dose, maximum plasma concentration, tmax and AUC of YM-21095 were 28.8 +/- 9.6 ng mL-1, 0.25 h and 23.6 +/- 7.7 ng h mL-1, respectively. Systemic bioavailability as determined on the basis of the ratio of AUC after intravenous and oral dose was 0.16 +/- 0.04%. In conscious, sodium-depleted monkeys, YM-21095 at an oral dose of 30 mg kg-1 lowered systolic blood pressure and inhibited plasma renin activity without affecting heart rate and plasma aldosterone concentration. Maximum plasma concentration of YM-21095 after 30 mg kg-1 oral dose to monkeys was 71.8 +/- 41.5 ng mL-1, which was reached 0.5 h after the dose. At equihypotensive doses, captopril and nicardipine increased plasma renin activity markedly and slightly, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "109": "Up to September, 1993, several questions were open on the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after myocardial infarction. The SAVE trial has shown that patients with left ventricular dysfunction and a recent (mean 11 days) myocardial infarction benefit from assuming captopril per os during the subsequent clinical course. The SOLVD trials have indicated that therapy with enalapril per os increases the survival of patients with left ventricular dysfunction, a history of myocardial infarction and hemodynamic decompensation. However, the CONSENSUS II trial has not shown similar results on patients with all range left ventricular function, treated within 24 hours of infarction with i.v. enalaprilat and then enalapril per os. In this study, 6-month mortality has been slightly better in the placebo group, and there seems not to be any subgroup benefitting from the ACE inhibitor. In October and November, 1993, the International Cardiologic Community has received the results of 3 large multicenter trials on postinfarction patients: the AIRE (ramipril per os), the GISSI 3 (lisinopril per os) and the ISIS 4 (captopril per os) studies. These trials has pointed out the followings: 1) prompt therapy (within 24 hours of chest pain) with ACE inhibitors is able to improve short term survival in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure, in women and old patients; 2) ACE inhibitors and nitro derivatives are complementary therapies in the acute and subacute phase of infarction, and their association produces the best improvement in short-term survival. There seems to be no intelligible reason, up to now, to deem that any ACE inhibitor should be considered better than another one in the acute phase of infarction, but still during the first 72 hours after the onset of chest pain the advantages have been shown only with lisinopril and captopril. The negative results of the CONSENSUS II trial are probably dependent on the excessively abrupt acute hypotensive effect of i.v. enalaprilat. This last \"large trial\" decade has taught us that many treatments can be advantageous for acute myocardial infarction but, apart from thrombolysis, all other medical therapies should not be given extensively, but to peculiar patients carefully selected on clinical grounds. Guidelines from official consensus conferences are expected now, to segregate different patterns of clinical presentations to be treated differently.", 
    "110": "Microdose (1 mg) captopril therapy is commonly used for the initial dose titration in patients with congestive heart failure. Since this dosage form is not commercially available, it has to be extemporaneously compounded. Quality control of each batch is commonly evaluated using the weight variation technique described in the USP. Despite careful titration with microdose, captopril capsules variability in patient's response has been observed. In order to explain this fluctuation, the actual content of extemporaneously compounded microdose captopril capsules was evaluated using a high pressure liquid chromatographic assay. Microdose captopril capsules were prepared by triturating 25 mg tablets with lactose in a mortar using standard geometric dilution technique and a Sharpe-Dohme hand-operated capsule filling machine. Forty-eight microdose captopril capsules were randomly selected from the compounded batch and were individually assayed for captopril amount. The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) amount of captopril in each capsule was 1.27 g +/- 0.31 mg with a range of 0.84 g to 1.96 mg. The coefficient of variation was 24.5%. Ten captopril capsules were randomly selected from the compounded batch and were individually weighed. The capsules had a mean weight +/- SD of 198.3 g +/- 21.2 mg and a coefficient of variation of 7.3%. Even though the extemporaneously prepared microdose captopril capsules were within acceptable limits for weight variation described in the USP, the actual dose administered to the patients could vary by as much as 24.5%.",

Immune-mediated tissue injury in Kawasaki disease is likely caused by response to a superantigen. Persistent functional and anatomic coronary abnormalities may lead to silent ischemia and increase the risk of early atherosclerotic heart disease. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is clearly beneficial, but specific therapy awaits further definition of the etiology and pathophysiology of Kawasaki disease. Recently updated diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease and acute rheumatic fever are discussed. Advances in the understanding of genetically determined abnormal immune responses to streptococcal pharyngitis may help explain acute rheumatic fever manifestations. Further advances have been made in the elucidation of the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy, particularly the role of viruses and genetic factors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to improve survival in dilated cardiomyopathy. Controversy regarding the possible myocardial depressant effect of zidovudine in human immunodeficiency virus infection is discussed.", 
    "112": "The effects of antihypertensive drugs on mesangial cell proliferation were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with anti-thymocyte serum (ATS)-induced glomerulo-nephritis. Rats were treated with either enalapril (Group 1), nifedipine (Group 2), or reserpine + hydrochlorothiazide + hydralazine (Group 3), or were untreated (Group 4). The animals were sacrificed 2, 4 and 7 days after ATS injection and the glomerular cell number and degree of mesangial area expansion were examined. A marked, similar decrease in glomerular nuclear cell number (NC) due to severe mesangiolysis was observed in all of the groups on day 2. Thereafter, an increase in NC reflecting mesangial cell proliferation after mesangiolysis occurred in Group 4 on days 4 and 7. In Group 1 and 2, the NC was significantly smaller than that in Group 4 on days 4 and 7, indicating suppression of mesangial cell proliferation. In Group 3, however, the number of NCs did not differ from that in Group 4 on days 4 and 7, indicating a lack of such suppression by conventional antihypertensive drugs. The degree of mesangial area expansion (MS) showed the same pattern as mesangial cell proliferation. That is, the rapid increases in MS seen in Group 4 on days 4 and 7 were apparently suppressed in Groups 1 and 2, but not in Group 3. Our in vivo observations that both an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker suppress mesangial cell proliferation and mesangial area expansion suggest that these agents have practical implications in the treatment of mesangial proliferative glomerular diseases through the suppression of excess mesangial cell proliferation.", 
    "113": "We assessed whether the local inhibition of myocardial converting enzyme by quinaprilat and captopril reduces the functional and metabolic damage caused by ischaemia and reperfusion. Quinaprilat and captopril were either subcutaneously injected (0.3 mg/kg once daily for 5-6 days) in the rabbit before isolation of the heart or delivered to the isolated hearts in the perfusate (10(-6) M) 60 min before ischaemia. Cardiac protection was evaluated in terms of left ventricular pressure recovery during reperfusion, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) release, mitochondrial function, ATP and CP tissue contents, calcium homeostasis and the occurrence of oxidative stress, established by measuring content and release of reduced and oxidized glutathione. Both drugs exerted cardioprotection. Optimal myocardial preservation is achieved when quinaprilat is prophylactically administered to the rabbit. Recovery of developed pressure on reperfusion improved from 11.3 +/- 2.7 (S.E.) to 25.4 +/- 5.4 mmHg, P < 0.01 and the release of CPK was reduced from 665.8 +/- 101.4 to 231.8 +/- 81.4 mU/min/g wet wt, P < 0.01. Peak of noradrenaline release was also attenuated, from 5.253 ng/min/g wet wt to 1.764 ng/min/g wet wt. The accumulation of tissue and mitochondrial calcium was reduced from 52.3 +/- 7.5 and 44.1 +/- 5.6 to 20.5 +/- 3.2 and 27.3 +/- 4.6 nmol/kg dry wt, respectively, P < 0.01. This resulted in significant (P < 0.01) improvement of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction during ischaemia and reperfusion and in a preservation of all indices of mitochondrial function, allowing a higher recovery of ATP and CP after reperfusion (from 4.1 +/- 0.5 and 5.2 +/- 0.5 to 11.1 +/- 1.1 and 24.8 +/- 1.0 mumol/g dry wt, respectively, P < 0.01). Reperfusion-induced myocardial accumulation and release of oxidized glutathione were reduced from 0.301 +/- 0.056 and 0.318 +/- 0.083 to 0.138 +/- 0.025 nmol/mg protein and 0.076 +/- 0.012 nmol/min/g wet wt, respectively, P < 0.01. Similar results were obtained when quinaprilat was administered to the isolated heart. These data suggest that the cardioprotective effect of quinaprilat is independent from haemodynamic changes or direct reduction of toxicity due to oxygen free-radicals but it is likely to be related to a reduction in the release of noradrenaline, maintenance of high energy phosphates and membrane integrity.",

Twenty-four patients completed the planned therapy. In 5 patients the drug had been withdrawn due to hypotension, and one patient died on the fourteenth day of observation because of heart failure worsening. After enalapril therapy 18 patients improved in NYHA functional classes. All patients showed left ventricular improvement based upon left ventricular systolic time intervals, 18 patients showed reduced peripheral vascular resistance, and in 9 patients echocardiography revealed a significant improvement of EF, CI and mVCF.

    "115": "Mesangial kinetics were studied in six groups of rats. Rats were either sham operated or were subjected to 1 1/3 nephrectomy (4/6 Nx). Each group was either untreated or was treated with enalapril (EN) or the drug regimen of hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide, and reserpine (HHR). Four weeks after surgery rats were injected with iodinated aggregated bovine serum albumin (I-aggBSA) and mesangial localization quantified 2, 4, or 8 h later. Mesangial kinetics in untreated 4/6 Nx rats were characterized by accumulation of I-aggBSA to 4 h after injection with rapid clearance over the 4-8-h period; i.e. mesangial trafficking was increased following 4/6 Nx. Mesangial trafficking in 4/6 Nx rats treated with EN was reduced by virtue of lesser uptake of I-aggBSA at 4 h and retarded clearance over 4-8 h when compared with untreated 4/6 Nx animals. Treatment of 4/6 Nx rats with HHR maintained the increased trafficking observed in untreated 4/6 Nx rats. At 30 weeks untreated 4/6 Nx rats had severe albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis. Both indices of renal damage were significantly less in 4/6 Nx rats treated with enalapril. Treatment with HHR did not prevent albuminuria and had only limited effectiveness in preventing glomerulosclerosis. The different effects of EN and HHR on mesangial trafficking and glomerulosclerosis provide further evidence for a relationship between mesangial trafficking following partial renal ablation and subsequent development of glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "116": "Patients with acute or chronic heart disease may have limited exercise capacity if they have reduced left ventricular function. Indexes of reduced left ventricular function during exercise are a predictor of subsequent survival although left ventricular ejection fraction is a poor predictor of physical endurance. We evaluated the effect of captopril on physical endurance in 48 males with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. On the 7th day following myocardial infarction patients were randomized to either captopril 50 mg daily or corresponding placebo. Patients were followed up by means of serial echocardiography and exercise stress testing for a period of 180 days. Exercise capacity was significantly improved in the captopril group. Changes in exercise capacity were significantly correlated to changes in left ventricular (LV) volumes and compliance. The beneficial effect of captopril on exercise capacity was probably mediated via improvement in LV performance and compliance.",

Imidapril induced a strong, dose-dependent and sustained inhibition of plasma converting enzyme activity and at the 20 mg an increase in active plasma renin. Other investigated biological parameters were not drug-affected. Imidapril, whatever the dose, did not significantly affect systemic hemodynamic parameters. Imidapril, 20 mg, significantly increased common carotid artery blood flow and diameter and brachial artery diameter. Brachial blood flow also tended to increase but this was not significant. The middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity investigated in only five volunteers, underwent spontaneous variations after placebo, and these variations were not affected by imidapril, suggesting that imidapril, whatever the dose, does not influence cerebral blood flow. Thus, imidapril's vasodilating properties apparently affect only the muscular (brachial artery) and cutaneous (external carotid artery) territories, but do not influence the cerebral vascular bed.",

Six of 69 patients had a positive captopril test, of these patients 5 had transplant renal artery stenosis. These patients were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or surgery. Based on angiographic results and blood pressure response after PTA or surgery the captopril test showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92% in the identification of hemodynamically significant stenosis of the transplant artery.

Our study was aimed at investigating the effects of captopril before thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and included 259 patients, hospitalized within 4 h of the onset of symptoms. Patients were randomly subdivided into two groups: the first group (131 patients, Group A, pretreatment) received 6.25 mg captopril orally about 15 min before i.v. administration of urokinase (2 million), the second group (128 patients, Group B, late-treatment), received captopril about 3 days after thrombolytic treatment.

    "123": "Our understanding of the clinical course of heart failure and the mechanism by which ACE inhibitors reduce mortality and morbidity is being enhanced by recent results from large trials. The belief that heart failure constitutes a gradual progression of symptoms and signs leading eventually to death has been challenged by the finding that many patients die suddenly, before the onset of symptoms at rest. Indeed, many studies have shown that sudden death, with or without the progression of heart failure, is the most common mode of death. Studies suggest that ACE inhibitors reduce mortality in heart failure both by preventing or delaying the progression of heart failure or sudden death, and by reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction. ACE inhibitors may improve ventricular function by a variety of mechanisms, including effects on neuro-endocrine systems, haemodynamic effects, and direct actions on the myocardium. ACE inhibitors may also have a long-term effect on plaque growth or rupture, which may account for the observed reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction. Although ACE inhibitors would be expected to lower the risk of arrhythmias, through their ability to reduce pressure and volume overload, this effect has not been observed consistently in large- scale trials. One of the most important clinical benefits of ACE inhibition may prove to be the reduction in myocardial infarction. The use of an ACE inhibitor should be considered in all patients with significantly impaired systolic left ventricular function (in the absence of contra- indications), even those who are asymptomatic, although the precise level of ventricular dysfunction at which treatment should be initiated remains to be clarified. The ability of long-term ACE inhibitor treatment to reduce ischaemic events in patients with normal left ventricular function is currently being studied. The optimum dose remains to be determined, although beneficial results have been obtained with enalapril, 20 mg daily, captopril, 150 mg daily and ramipril 5 mg b.i.d.",

It was found that dipsogenic doses of angiotensin-2 could inhibit food and alcohol intake mostly by a suppression of food and alcohol motivations. Specific antagonist of \"classical\" angiotensin-2 receptors saralasin could not block angiotensin-2 effects. A significant decrease of food and ethanol intake was revealed after intraventricular injections of enzyme blockers captopril and bestatin, which increase endogenic levels of angiotensin-1 and angiotensin-3, and also angiotensin-2-(3-7). So was shown the ability of angiotensins to suppress the dominant food or alcohol motivations by the activation of some other but not the \"classical\" angiotensin-2 receptors. Was suggested the involvement of angiotensins in the coordination of the different kinds of functional systems to create the optimal conditions for realization of drinking behaviour.",

The effects of EM on some aspects of the energy metabolism and membrane properties of mitochondria from rat liver and kidney cortex were studied, but only the latter were significantly affected. With 0.8 mM of EM and 2-oxoglutarate as oxidizable substrate for isolated mitochondria from rat kidney cortex, the findings were: (a) inhibition of the respiratory rate in state III (37 per cent) and decrease (45 per cent) in respiratory control ratio (RCR), with only one addition of ADP; (b) reinforcement of the inhibition when a second addition of ADP was made; (c) no significant effect either on the rate of respiration in state IV or on the ADP/O ratio; (d) no effect on the ATPase activity of mitochondria from liver or kidney cortex; (e) inhibition of the transmembrane potential (delta psi) after a second addition of ADP; (f) inhibition of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. It is suggested that in kidney mitochondria, EM interferes in the gluconeogenesis dependence of at least five substrates: 2-oxoglutarate, glutamine, glutamate, lactate, and pyruvate. Also, EM may inhibit Na+/H+ exchange causing natriuresis.",

Fifteen IDDM patients were randomized to either placebo or the CEI, lisinopril. Dosage of lisinopril was titrated over 3 months to reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to < or = 2.33 mL/sec. Evaluation at 18 months demonstrated the lisinopril group had a marked reduction in renal size (16.9 +/- 1.1, baseline versus 12.8 +/- 0.9 cm, 18 months; p < 0.05) and microalbuminuria (92 +/- 11 micrograms/min, baseline versus 23 +/- 26 micrograms/min, 18 months; p < 0.05). No change in renal size was noted in the placebo group (15.4 +/- 0.8, baseline versus 14.9 +/- 0.7 cm, 18 months; NS) and albuminuria increased (118 +/- 15 micrograms/min, baseline versus 293 +/- 32 micrograms/min, 18 months; p < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure at 18 months was significantly lower in the lisinopril group compared to placebo (102 +/- 4, placebo versus 87 +/- 6 mm Hg, CEI, p < 0.05). This study supports previous animal studies that document reductions in both microalbuminuria and renal size by a CEI. The overall impact of these findings on preservation of renal function cannot be assessed, however, in this short-term study.", 
    "128": "Renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD), with hypoplasia especially of renal proximal convoluted tubules and clinical neonatal anuria or oliguria, has been reported as a congenital familial (autosomal recessive) disease, variably with features of oligohydramnios, Potter syndrome, or pulmonary hypoplasia. A similar tubular lesion due to antenatal tubular atrophy has been reported for conjoined twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome or acardia and in infants of mothers given antihypertensive agents, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, during pregnancy, and it has been seen as a unilateral lesion in young infants with renal artery stenosis due to arteritis or medial arterial calcinosis. The renal tubular changes in RTD are very like those of the \"endocrine kidney\" in experimental animals and resemble those of the renal tubular atrophy of end-stage kidney diseases such as glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial kidney disease, obstructive uropathy/pyelonephritis, graft rejection of transplanted kidneys, or the renal parenchymal changes seen with protracted dialysis therapy. Labeled lectins that differentially mark proximal convoluted, distal convoluted and connecting, and collecting tubules showed no distinctive differences in staining patterns of the hypoplastic renal tubules of infants and children with RTD, postnatal renal artery obstruction, or the various types of end-stage renal disease with the lectins used (PNA, GSLI, UEA, and LTA). The findings suggest that the renal tubular changes in some if not all the conditions studied are the result of renal ischemia. The reported familial RTD with hypernephronic nephromegaly may be a specific disorder, but other forms could reflect renal ischemia acquired in utero or in early or later postnatal life.",

Several antihypertensive agents are capable of inducing regression of LVH, but it is not known which class of drugs is most effective. The impact of drug-induced reversal of hypertrophy on ventricular function remains a controversial issue. Furthermore, the long-term clinical benefits of LVH regression have yet to be documented. Controversies also exist regarding the clinical outcomes associated with drug-induced LVH regression.",

    "139": "The tetanus toxin light chain blocks calcium induced vasopressin release from neurohypophysial nerve terminals. Here we show that histidine residue 233 within the putative zinc binding motif of the tetanus toxin light chain is essential for the inhibition of exocytosis, in the rat. The zinc chelating agent dipicolinic acid as well as captopril, an inhibitor of zinc-dependent peptidases, counteract the effect of the neurotoxin. Synthetic peptides, the sequences of which correspond to motifs present in the cytoplasmic domain of the synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptobrevin 1 and 2, prevent the effect of the tetanus toxin light chain. Our results indicate that zinc bound to the zinc binding motif constitutes the active site of the tetanus toxin light chain. Moreover they suggest that cleavage of synaptobrevin by the neurotoxin causes the inhibition of exocytotic release of vasopressin from secretory granules.", 
    "140": "Effects of dietary sodium restriction combined with fish oil supplementation on BP and related risk factors were assessed in hypertensives treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. After a four week run-in phase, a six week intervention trial was conducted in which four matched groups of 14 patients, taking either captopril or enalapril, were assigned to one of four dietary treatments: low sodium (80 mmol/day) with fish oil (5 g of omega-3 fatty acids per day); normal sodium (150 mmol/day) with fish oil; low sodium with olive oil; normal sodium with olive oil. All subjects adopted a low sodium diet and adjustments of nutrient intake were made by double-blind administration of sodium and oils in supplementary tablets and capsules. BP fell in all treatment groups during intervention. However, the reduction of SBP was 4.2 mmHg greater in subjects on a low sodium intake than in those taking normal sodium. There were no differences in BP between those taking olive oil and those taking fish oil but plasma triglycerides and serum thromboxane production were reduced by 27% and 51%, respectively in the latter. Thus the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors can be augmented by sodium restriction alone but supplementing the diet with fish oil may yield additional cardiovascular benefits.", 
    "141": "The ACE inhibitors cilazapril and captopril were administered at 10 and 100 mg/day, respectively, to spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) from the 12th to the 22nd week of life. Both drugs produced statistically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, left-ventricular mass and index of left-ventricular hypertrophy in SHR. After cilazapril treatment, the morphology of SHR cardiocytes became similar to that in untreated normotensive rats, while in captopril-treated rats, myofibrils were disarranged, obliquely oriented and smaller than normal, with areas of electron-transparent sarcoplasm separating the myofibril bundles; mitochondria were also altered. In WKY rats, we observed no statistically significant changes in blood pressure, ventricular weight and hypertrophy index between the two drugs; however, there were different effects of the two drugs on the ultrastructural morphology of the myocardium. These observations suggest that these two molecularly dissimilar ACE inhibitors act differently at the tissue level despite similar effects on blood pressure and left-ventricular mass.", 
    "142": "Met-enkephalin concentration-dependently and transiently inhibited the ileal twitch contraction and this inhibition gradually recovered with time. Bacitracin, phosphoramidon, thiorphan and captopril did not influence the twitch inhibition of met-enkephalin, but bestatin increased the twitch inhibitory potency of met-enkephalin and terminated it in a manner which almost paralleled that of untreated tissue. Transient inhibition of twitch contraction after tetanic stimulation (post-tetanic twitch inhibition) was obtained. Bestatin increased the potency of met-enkephalin and this was terminated within 2 min. Phosphoramidon tended to increase the potency and delayed the termination of post-tetanic twitch inhibition. Bacitracin, thiorphan and captopril did not influence either the potency or the termination of post-tetanic twitch inhibition. Morphine-induced twitch inhibition was not influenced by bacitracin, bestatin or phosphoramidon. These results suggest that bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase and phosphoramidon-sensitive enkephalinase take part in post-tetanic twitch inhibition, acting in a different mode of action, and have an important role in the termination of the pharmacological action of endogenous opioids (post-tetanic twitch inhibition) in MPLM. This different mode of response of bestatin and phosphoramidon upon post-tetanic twitch inhibition may underlie that aminopeptidase is a more soluble enzyme and enkephalinase is membrane-bound in myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle (MPLM).", 
    "143": "Anecdotal reports of a mood-elevating effect in patients and improvements in the performance of memory tests in the clinic has led to investigations into the nootropic actions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. A cognitive enhancing action for the ACE inhibitors has been demonstrated in a number of animals models of memory function. Neurochemical studies in animals have shown that angiotensin II acting via an angiotensin II receptor can inhibit the release of 3HAch from entorhinal cortex slices. Thus the ability of ACE inhibitors to facilitate cognitive processes may be related to reduced availability of angiotensin II. Lack of specificity of ACE inhibitors may be a limiting factor in the development of such compounds as cognitive enhancers. However, the recent development of selective antagonists for subtypes of the angiotensin II receptor may represent a novel approach for the treatment of cognitive disorders with an underlying cholinergic disturbance.", 
    "144": "Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) may be instrumental in the development of atherosclerosis. We have examined the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril and quinaprilat and the -SH containing compound N-acetylcysteine on LDL oxidation. Oxidation of isolated human LDL was initiated with CuCl2. Conjugated diene formation (monitored spectrophotometrically at 234 nm) gave a measure of LDL oxidation. Captopril inhibited LDL oxidation but quinaprilat did not. The lag phase to the rapid increase in absorbance at 234 nm determined was 109 (65-157) min median and range for control samples and rose to 209 (168-305) min with captopril 10 microM, a ratio of 2.1:1 for drug to control (P = 0.01). N-acetylcysteine had a similar effect to captopril (drug to control lag time ratio 2.0:1, with NAC 10 microM), i.e. suggesting resistance to oxidation was due to the -SH group of both drugs. Captopril may have a potentially anti-atherosclerotic property not shared by other ACE inhibitors.",

The long-term systematic captopril therapy in individually selected doses led to a decrease and stabilization of blood pressure, minimized subjective disease manifestations and improved hemodynamic characteristics. The application of the drug in moderate doses prevented the development of side effects that might require drug discontinuance.", 
    "146": "The effect of intravenous perindoprilat, 0.5 mg/kg, on regional blood flow (radioactive microspheres, 15 microns), systemic hemodynamics, vein tone and cardiac functions was evaluated in conscious rats with congestive heart failure. Experimental heart failure was induced by embolization of coronary vessels with microspheres 21 days before the experiment. Perindoprilat reduced mean arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance, and end-diastolic left ventricular pressure. Perindoprilat induced an increase in cardiac index, stroke volume and heart rate. Blood flow in the renal, small intestinal and skin vascular beds was more profound in the heart failure group than in sham-operated animals. Perindoprilat unchanged the mean circulatory filling pressure in sham-operated animals and decreased it by 15% in rats with heart failure.", 
    "147": "To clarify how angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition affects left ventricular function through ventricular unloading, ventricular wall stress, ventricular volumes, and other cardiac indices and exercise tolerance were evaluated in 17 patients with mild to moderate chronic congestive heart failure before and after 3 months of treatment with enalapril. Echocardiographic examination revealed that treatment with this angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor resulted in significant reductions in end-systolic wall stress (117 +/- 25 to 89 +/- 28 g/cm2, p < 0.01) and left ventricular volume indices (end-diastolic: 163 +/- 56 to 143 +/- 60; end-systolic 99 +/- 51 to 77 +/- 57 ml/m2 p < 0.01). Ejection fraction (42 +/- 11 to 48 +/- 13%, p < 0.01) and systolic blood pressure/end-systolic volume (SBP/ESV; 1.06 +/- 0.30 to 1.33 +/- 0.48 mmHg/ml, p < 0.01) were both increased. By radionuclide ventriculography, ejection fraction and peak ejection rate (2.30 +/- 0.74 to 2.80 +/- 0.76 EDV/sec, p < 0.01) were increased, while time to peak ejection, time to peak filling, and peak filling rate were unchanged. Heart rate and double product at exercise were decreased and delta EF was significantly increased (-1.4 +/- 4.1 to 1.6 +/- 4.4%, p < 0.02). The decrease in end-systolic wall stress was consistently related to both the increase in ejection fraction and SBP/ESV, while the decrease in end-diastolic volume was related only to SBP/ESV and not to ejection fraction. Furthermore, there was a direct relationship between the decrease in systolic wall stress and the decrease in end-diastolic volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "148": "The beneficial hemodynamic and clinical effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in patients with severe congestive heart failure has recently been documented in large-scale studies. This mode of therapy when added to digitalis and diuretics improves survival. To evaluate the clinical effect and the changes in cardiac dimensions of captopril compared to placebo we followed 50 patients with severe congestive heart failure over 1 year using echo-Doppler cardiography. After randomization, 25 patients were started on captopril and 25 patients on placebo. At baseline and at 6 and 12 months, each patient underwent exercise tolerance test, radionuclide angiography to estimate left and right ventricular ejection fraction, M mode and two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler cardiography to calculate cardiac dimensions and stroke volumes. During follow-up two patients in the captopril group and four in the placebo group died. Due to clinical deterioration nine patients in the placebo group had to be started on open-label captopril. Treatment with captopril was associated with a more significant improvement in functional class and exercise duration compared to placebo. Forward stroke volume estimated from Doppler echocardiography increased significantly by captopril from 47 +/- 3 to 55 +/- 3 ml and decreased in the placebo-treated patients from 49 +/- 5 to 44 +/- 4 ml. This improvement was associated with a trend towards reduced heart rate by captopril. Left ventricular end diastolic volume tended to increase in the placebo group and did not change in the captopril group. Calculated mitral regurgitant volume at 6 and 12 months tended to be lower in the captopril-treated patients. Thus captopril therapy proved efficacious in patients with severe congestive heart failure and resulted in increased forward stroke volume; it may have a beneficial effect on cardiac dimensions and on mitral regurgitation.", 
    "149": "Ramipril is a long-acting nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor introduced for clinical use about a decade ago. Ramipril is a prodrug that undergoes de-esterification in the liver to form ramiprilat, its active metabolite. Ramipril rapidly distributes to all tissues, with the liver, kidneys and lungs showing markedly higher concentrations of the drug than the blood. After absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, rapid hydrolysis of ramipril occurs in the liver. In the therapeutic concentration range, protein binding of ramipril and ramiprilat is 73 and 56%, respectively. Ramiprilat binds to ACE with high affinity at concentrations similar to that of the enzyme and establishes equilibrium slowly. Although ramipril is metabolised by hepatic and renal mechanisms to both a glucuronate conjugate and a diketopiperazine derivative, most of the drug is excreted in the urine as ramiprilat and the glucuronate conjugate of ramiprilat. Elimination from the body is characterised by a relatively rapid initial phase with a half-life of 7 hours and a late phase with a half-life of about 120 hours. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between ramipril and other drugs have been reported. The drug has been generally well tolerated with the most prevalent adverse effects being dizziness (3.4%), headache (3.2%), weakness (1.9%) and nausea (1.7%). Ramipril is an effective and well tolerated drug for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure in all patients, including those with renal or hepatic dysfunction, and the elderly.",

    "151": "Procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide (PIIIP) is cleaved off procollagen type III during the biosynthesis of type III collagen. Thus, to assess the synthesis of collagen type III in essential hypertension, we determined the serum concentrations of PIIIP in 24 patients with never-treated essential hypertension and in 30 normotensive controls. In addition, serum concentrations of PIIIP were measured in 15 patients after receiving lisinopril during 6 months. Serum PIIIP was higher in hypertensives than controls (11.20 +/- 0.76 v 8.47 +/- 0.77 ng/mL, mean +/- SEM, P < .01). A direct correlation was found between serum PIIIP and plasma renin activity (r = 0.54, P < .01) in the group of hypertensives. In addition, serum PIIIP was correlated inversely with maximal early transmitral flow velocity measured during diastole by Doppler echocardiography (r = -0.74, P < .001) in the group of hypertensive patients. The serum PIIIP levels decreased significantly in patients treated with lisinopril (11.76 +/- 0.84 v 8.47 +/- 0.66 ng/mL, P < .01). A significant increase of plasma renin activity and a significant decrease of plasma aldosterone was observed in these patients after treatment with lisinopril. These results suggest that increased collagen type III synthesis is present in patients with essential hypertension. Abnormal synthesis of collagen type III in essential hypertension may be related to the activity of circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Whether an excessive synthesis of myocardial collagen type III is responsible for increased serum PIIIP present in essential hypertension deserves further investigation.",

At the end of a 4-week placebo run-in period, 36 patients were randomly allocated to receive a 12-week course of treatment with quinapril (10, 20, or 40 mg) once daily or captopril (25, 50, or 75 mg) twice daily. Seventeen patients in each group completed the study. The mean change in mean blood pressure for patients taking quinapril (mean dose 32 mg/24 h) was -5 mm Hg (P = .002), and for patients taking captopril (mean dose 132 mg/24 h), -9 mm Hg (P = .002). The baseline urinary albumin excretion rate in both groups was (mean +/- EEM) 57 +/- 7 micrograms/min. Fifteen patients in the quinapril group and 12 patients in the captopril group had baseline albumin excretion rates of more than 20 micrograms/min. Mean urinary albumin excretion decreased in patients treated with quinapril from 55 to 33 micrograms/min (mean decrease 22 micrograms/min, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 43 micrograms/min; P = .031) and with captopril from 59 to 41 micrograms/min (mean decrease 18 micrograms/min, 95% CI, 3 to 32 micrograms/min; P = .025). No significant modifications were observed in serum lipid concentrations, serum and urinary electrolytes, and magnesium or phosphorus metabolism.

    "153": "The diagnostic utility of post-captopril renal vein renin (RVR) measurements was quantitated in 43 patients (mean age 62, range 41 to 77 years) undergoing aortography to rule out renovascular hypertension (RVHT), and then compared with that of pre-captopril RVR measurements. Four patterns of post-captopril RVR secretion were defined: 1) unilateral hypersecretion (stenotic/peripheral [S/P] > 2.0) and contralateral suppression (C/P) (< 1.25) (n = 12); 2) bilateral hypersecretion (S/P > 2.0, C/P > 1.25) (n = 14); 3) bilateral suppression (peripheral plasma renin activity [PRA] < 1.0 ng/mL/h) (n = 12); and 4) \"normal\" (RVR/PRA < 2.0 bilaterally) (n = 5). Using the radiologic findings as the definitive test, the sensitivity and specificity of post-captopril RVR measurements in detecting unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenoses (85% or greater of lumen) was 61 and 96%, and 92 and 90%, respectively, a significant improvement compared with those of pre-captopril RVR measurements (44 and 62%, and 17 and 93%, respectively). Post-captopril RVR measurements facilitated the diagnosis of both hypersecretion and, when present, contralateral suppression of renin, and therefore, are useful in the diagnosis of atherosclerotic RVHT, and in planning its treatment. However, confirmation by more extensive prospective studies, including treatment outcome, is needed.", 
    "154": "The present study investigates the mechanism(s) of action of relaxations induced by bradykinin and by electrical field stimulation (EFS) in isolated rat anococcygeus muscle, where contractile tone has been elevated with clonidine. Bradykinin, EFS, and the bradykinin B1 receptor agonist, des-Arg9-bradykinin, produced quantitatively and qualitatively similar relaxations. Bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist, [des-Arg9,Leu8]-bradykinin (1 microM), attenuated the relaxation responses of bradykinin B1 receptor agonist and inhibited bradykinin and EFS-induced relaxation responses. Bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, [beta-(2-thienyl)-Ala5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin (1 microM), significantly inhibited the relaxation responses of bradykinin, EFS, and bradykinin B1 receptor agonist. Methylene blue (30 microM) and N-methylhydroxylamine (1 mM) significantly inhibited the bradykinin- and EFS-induced relaxation responses. The relaxation responses of bradykinin and EFS were not affected by captopril (5 microM), superoxide dismutase (100 U/ml), and catalase (100 U/ml). Nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NG-nitro-arginine (L-NOARG, 30 microM), significantly inhibited the EFS- and bradykinin-induced relaxation responses. L-arginine (100 microM) reversed the inhibitory effect of L-NOARG on the relaxation responses of EFS and bradykinin. In addition, L-arginine potentiated the relaxation responses of EFS and bradykinin. The data of the present study suggests that bradykinin, similar to EFS, generates an endogenous nitrate, probably nitric oxide, which subsequently activates guanylate cyclase and relaxes the rat anococcygeus muscle.", 
    "155": "The current study examined three pressor systems which might support mean arterial pressure (MAP) after lesions of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). In two protocols, bilateral electrolytic lesions or sham lesions were placed in the RVLM of rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. In the first protocol, the following drugs were given sequentially after placement of the lesions: captopril (5 mg/kg) and d-pentamethylene methylated tyrosine (30 micrograms/kg), a vascular arginine-vasopressin antagonist (AVPX). A final procedure consisted of spinal-cord transection. The second protocol was identical to the first except that the order of drug administration was reversed. In the first protocol, RVLM lesions caused a slight, but statistically significant, decrease in MAP from 118 +/- 3 mmHg to 103 +/- 5 mmHg. After captopril and AVPX, MAP further decreased to 87 +/- 5 mmHg and 62 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively. The MAP fell to 38 +/- 2 mmHg after spinal-cord transection. In the sham-lesion group, MAP rose slightly from 127 +/- 6 mmHg to 134 +/- 7 mmHg after placement of the sham lesions. A significant reduction in MAP was not seen until after administration of AVPX, which decreased MAP to 103 +/- 6 mmHg. Spinal-cord transection substantially lowered MAP to 36 +/- 4 mmHg. In the second protocol, RVLM lesions had no effect on MAP. Administration of AVPX had little effect on MAP (before: 117 +/- 5 mmHg; after: 102 +/- 7 mmHg). In contrast, sequential administration of captopril substantially decreased MAP to 55 +/- 5 mmHg. Spinal cord transection lowered MAP to 33 +/- 1 mmHg. A decrease in MAP in the companion sham-lesion group was not seen until after administration of captopril (before: 109 +/- 8 mmHg; after: 89 +/- 11 mmHg). The greatest fall in MAP followed spinal cord transection (to 39 +/- 6 mmHg). These results demonstrate normotension after RVLM lesions despite a marked reduction in sympathetic vasomotor activity. They also indicate that, after RVLM lesions, arterial pressure is maintained mainly by activity of the renin-angiotensin system and by AVP secretion.", 
    "156": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril, a free-thiol compound used widely as an antihypertensive agent, also inhibits radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats (Ward et al., Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 19:1405, 1990). In an attempt to clarify the antifibrotic mechanism of captopril in vivo, the present study examined the effect of the drug on proliferation of human lung fibroblasts in culture. Captopril produced a drug dose-dependent reduction in fibroblast proliferation and 3H-thymidine incorporation during a 24-72-hr incubation. This cytostatic action of captopril was not the result of cytotoxicity as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, or by 51Cr or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Fibroblasts stimulated to proliferate by basic FGF were more sensitive to the antimitotic effect of captopril than were unstimulated cells. The ability of captopril to inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation was not reversed by exogenous angiotensin 2, and was not mimicked by the nonthiol ACE inhibitor lisinopril. These data indicate that the cytostatic effect of captopril was not attributable to ACE inhibition. Penicillamine, a thiol compound with virtually no ACE inhibitory activity, also reduced fibroblast 3H-thymidine incorporation, indicating that the antimitotic action of captopril may represent a nonspecific sulfhydryl effect. This study suggests that the antifibrotic activity of captopril in irradiated lung may result in part from a direct inhibition of fibroblast proliferation, particularly in fibroblasts responding to mitogenic stimuli.", 
    "157": "In a tertiary referral centre 63 patients underwent 67 treatment periods with enalapril. The median age was 5.4 months. All children had signs of heart failure: congestive cardiac failure with breathlessness at rest was present in 88%. Haemodynamic groups were left-to-right shunt (n = 15), impaired ventricular function (n = 14), after cardiac surgery (n = 23), valvar regurgitation (n = 12), and hypertension (n = 3). Serial clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were used to judge outcome. The mean (SD) maximal dose was 0.30 (0.21) mg/kg/day. Thirty nine (58%) patients improved, 20 (30%) showed no improvement, and eight (12%) had side effects requiring discontinuation of enalapril. Renal failure in eight patients was related to young age, low weight, and left-to-right shunt group. Three patients died in congestive heart failure with renal failure. Enalapril was clinically safe and effective for children with cardiac failure secondary to ventricular impairment, valvar regurgitation, or after cardiac surgery.

    "158": "We studied the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) after amino acid loading in order to elucidate whether or not glomerular hyperfiltration is mediated by these hormones. Eight healthy controls without kidney disease (group 1), 8 renal graft recipients (group 2) and 8 patients after nephrectomy (group 3) were studied. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of amino acid loading on RAS and ANP and glomerular filtration during acute application of captopril in healthy controls. Clearances in insulin (CIn) and para-aminohippuric acid (CPAH) were determined during an infusion of 0.9% saline and during amino acid loading. CIn increased in healthy controls from 96.5 +/- 3.3 to 111.9 +/- 4.4 ml/min (p < 0.01), CPAH rose from 577 +/- 28.7 to 618.9 +/- 38 ml/min (p = NS). During the combined application of amino acid infusion and 25 mg captopril, CIN increased to 125.0 +/- 16.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.01) and there was no significant increase in CPAH which was 595 +/- 77 ml/min/1.73 m2. There was no significant change in renal vascular resistance, but filtration fraction increased from 17 +/- 1 to 19 +/- 1% under amino acid infusion and increased further under the application of captopril to 21 +/- 2% (p < 0.05). In renal graft recipients, CIn had a tendency to increase during amino acid infusion from 78.4 +/- 5.8 to 84.7 +/- 6.5 ml/min (p = NS). In patients after nephrectomy, CIn did not increase (84.5 +/- 6 ml/min) but CPAH did from 345.7 +/- 26.3 to 409 +/- 24.1 ml/min (p < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "159": "Acute renal failure due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) usually results from a marked fall in renal perfusion pressure in patients with renovascular disease. We report herein one case of acute kidney transplant artery thrombosis in a patient with renovascular hypertension. The thrombosis occurred immediately after a single dose of ACEI for evaluation of a renal transplant artery stenosis by renal scintigraphy. The dramatic fall of arterial pressure observed in our patient probably played an important role in the thrombosis. The risk of the administration of a single dose of ACEI coupled with renal scintigraphy in diagnosing renovascular hypertension is stressed.", 
    "160": "The main objective of this multicenter study was to compare the efficacy of an increase in dose and of a synergic combination in the 68 patients out of 126 (54%) with hypertension (DBP between 95 and 120 mm Hg after 2 weeks of placebo) who did not respond (DBP > or = 95 mmHg) to a 4-week treatment of 20 mg per day of lisinopril. Patients were randomized to receive a 4-week double-blind treatment of either 40 mg per day of lisinopril or the combination of 20 mg of lisinopril and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day. Mean reductions of systolic (inter-group comparison: p = 0.08) and diastolic BP (p = 0.006) as well as the proportion of responders (82% versus 45%, p < or = 0.01) were greater with the lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination than with 40 mg of lisinopril. Tolerance was good in the 3 groups. The administration of a synergic combination is justified when hypertension is not controlled by a monotherapy.", 
    "161": "We compared the acute hemodynamic effects of captopril and nitrates in 11 patients with severe congestive heart failure and grade IV cardiac disability. Pressures were measured using a Swan-Ganz catheter system; cardiac output and stroke index were measured by thermodilution, and left-ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction were calculated simultaneously with the hemodynamic measurements from radionuclide ventriculography. Measurements were made in each of 4 treatment states: control, sublingual isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN; 5 and 15 mg), oral captopril (50-200 mg daily) and during combined therapy with captopril and ISDN. Captopril produced a fall in mean arterial pressure (p < 0.01) from 81 +/- 14 to 72 +/- 13 mm Hg and a rise in stroke index from 30 +/- 5 to 35 +/- 91/min/m2 (p < 0.05), while LV ejection fraction increased from 18 +/- 5 to 21 +/- 7% (p < 0.05). ISDN reduced mean arterial, pulmonary arterial, right-atrial and wedge pressure. The combination of captopril and ISDN produced a greater fall in mean arterial pressure, a further rise in ejection fraction to 22 +/- 8% (p < 0.05), a fall in systemic (p < 0.05) and pulmonary vascular resistance (p < 0.01) and a rise in cardiac (p < 0.01) and stroke work index (p < 0.01), while the beneficial effects of ISDN on right-atrial, pulmonary arterial and wedge pressure were again achieved. LV contractility, assessed from end-systolic stress-shortening relations, was essentially unaltered or decreased very slightly. The study showed that combined therapy with captopril and nitrates produced acute hemodynamic benefits superior to those achieved by treatment with captopril or nitrates alone.", 
    "162": "The early administration of nitrates in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may lower myocardial oxygen demand and increase blood supply to the ischemic myocardium. Actually, nitrates are the drugs most largely used in AMI patients, but no definite proof of their clinical benefits had been reported before GISSI 3 and ISIS 4. Only a meta-analysis of several trials carried out before the thrombolytic era showed that intravenous nitrates and probably oral nitrates can reduce mortality when given early to patients with myocardial infarction. The adjunctive benefit of nitrates in AMI patients receiving the treatments recommended today (thrombolysis, aspirin, beta-blockade) remained undefined. Accordingly, two large controlled randomized studies--GISSI 3 and ISIS 4--were undertaken to verify benefits and risks of nitrate strategy vs ACE-inhibition strategy in AMI. Overall, about 80,000 patients were enrolled. In both studies a small, non significant decrease of mortality was observed in patients allocated to nitrate arms. In GISSI 3, the mortality reduction was greater in patients receiving both nitroglycerin and lisinopril. Either intravenous or by oral or transdermal route nitrates were well tolerated. In conclusion, the systematic administration of nitrates in acute myocardial infarction induces limited benefits in relation to the strategy based on the clinically indicated nitrate administration (applied in 60% of the control patients) but does not bring up risks.", 
    "163": "Besides defining the appropriate doses of frusemide in uraemic patients, A. Heidland's contribution to the treatment of hypertension in chronic renal failure consisted in the following demonstrations: (1) In patients on chronic haemodialysis, calcium antagonists have a beneficial effect on their glucose intolerance and decreased plasma levels of 25OH vitamin D while their effect on blood lipids is neutral. (2) In 5/6 nephrectomized rats, captopril, verapamil, and metoprolol have the same protective effect on their GFR and tubular secretion of protons, at equal blood-pressure-lowering effect. (3) In rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, atrial natriuretic peptide does not play a role in their hyperfiltration. (4) Severe retinopathy is observed in patients with uraemic nephropathies at a much smaller elevation of their blood pressure than in patients with essential hypertension. This article reviews the following points: (1) The role of hypertension in the loss of renal function is convincingly demonstrated only in a few experimental models, and in man only in malignant hypertension and diabetic nephropathy but not in essential hypertension nor in non-diabetic nephropathy. However, preliminary results suggests that antihypertensive treatment may retard the progression of renal disease in normotensive patients (DBP <90 mmHg) with either microalbuminuric diabetes and normal renal function or non-diabetic uraemic nephropathy. (2) Only the ACE inhibitors have been proved to have a specific renal protective effect, independent of their diurnal blood-pressure-lowering effect, both in diabetic nephropathy and in non-diabetic uraemic nephropathy.", 
    "164": "The influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on acute extrarenal and renal potassium elimination in stable chronic renal failure has been examined in 10 male patients median age 44 y; mean CLCR 42 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2. In a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, K+ 0.3 or 0.4 mmol.kg-1 body weight was infused IV on two occasions while the patients also received an infusion either of placebo or 0.5 mg of the ACE inhibitor perindoprilat in random order. Plasma K+ levels and urinary K+ excretion were measured at regular intervals. During the study patients adhered to an isocaloric diet providing a standardised daily intake of potassium and sodium (50 mmol K+ and 40 mmol Na+). The median rise in plasma K+ was not significantly different after placebo (delta K 0.66 mmol.l-1) compared with to the infusion of perindoprilat (delta K 0.66 mmol.l-1). The median baseline urinary K+ excretion rate was 6.5 mmol.3 h-1 before the placebo infusion and 5.9 mmol.3 h-1 before infusion of perindoprilat. During the potassium load, the urinary excretion rate rose to 16.1 mmol.3 h-1 (after placebo) and 15.1 mmol.3 h-1 after perindoprilat in the first 3 h, and it returned almost to the baseline value within the next 3 h (5.6 mmol.3 h-1 after placebo and 5.7 mmol.3 h-1 after perindoprilat); the differences were not statistically significant. With perindoprilat a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure and ACE activity, an increase in renin plasma activity and a decrease in aldosterone concentrations were observed compared to the placebo infusion. There was no significant differences plasma in adrenaline or insulin levels after either infusion. Thus, ACE inhibition did not interfere either with the extrarenal or the renal disposal of an acute potassium load in patients with chronic renal failure.", 
    "165": "The intradialytic symptoms that can be linked to components of the extracorporeal circuit of greatest clinical importance are the Type A (anaphylactoid) reactions. Most of these are IgE-mediated reactions due to ethylene oxide and are preventable by adequate degassing of the dialyzer by the manufacturer and by adequate rinsing of the dialyzer just prior to use. AN69-associated reactions are a second group, and are probably mediated by membrane-induced bradykinin generation coupled with ACE-inhibitor induced prolongation of bradykinin half-life. Type A reactions occur in a reuse setting, alos, and these may be related to some as yet poorly understood interaction between bleach, reuse sterilants, and certain dialyzer membranes, again, with ACE inhibitors playing an amplifier role. There is no compelling evidence linking membrane-induced complement activation to type A dialyzer reactions. However, there is a large body of evidence in animal models that exposure to complement fragment-releasing membranes can increase the pulmonary artery pressure and increase thromboxane formation. Thus, at least in principle, a case can be made for using unsubstituted cellulose membranes with caution in patients with a history of atopy or eosinophilia, particularly if acetate dialysate is to be used. Such a caution, however, must be viewed as conjectural in the absence of definitive evidence. Type B dialyzer reactions (mild back and chest pain 20-60 min into the dialysis session) is a phenomenon that is in the process of vanishing. The reason why is unclear. These reactions may have been due to some sort of dialyzer contaminant, or they may have been due to complement fragment release and required the use of acetate dialysate as a cofactor. In any event, recent well designed studies fail to find any differences in symptoms between unsubstituted cellulose and synthetic membranes. Membrane-induced complement fragment release also may play a minor role in dialysis hypoxemia, but evidence is conflicting in this area. Again, the use of acetate dialysate appears to be an important cofactor. Post-dialysis events which may be conceivably linked to the delayed effects of complement fragment releasing membranes need to be evaluated in controlled studies. Studies suggesting increased post-dialysis catabolism with use of unsubstituted cellulose membranes need to be confirmed in dialysis patients, and symptomatic correlates should be sought and evaluated.", 
    "166": "The present study was undertaken to examine an effect of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist on urinary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) excretion following furosemide, a loop diuretic, in rats. Furosemide (30 mg/kg) was given orally with or without pretreatment with derapril (30 mg/kg), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, TCV-116 (1 mg/kg), an AT1 receptor antagonist, or losartan (10 mg/kg), another AT1 receptor antagonist. The 6-hour urine was collected following furosemide, and the urinary excretion of PGE2 was determined. The urinary PGE2 increased significantly following furosemide alone. However, such a furosemide-induced increase was not observed with pretreatment with derapril, TCV-116 or losartan. These results suggest that the increased urinary excretion of PGE2 following furosemide is blunted by derapril, TCV-116 and losartan. As TCV-116 and losartan are selective AT1 receptor antagonists, the effect of furosemide on renal PGE2 production, as reflected by the urinary PGE2, might be mediated by an activation of AT1 receptors.", 
    "167": "Clinical practice is complex and is influenced by a number of factors such as time since medical qualification, opportunities for further education and peer review, as well as trial results and marketing. Systematic audit and peer review are powerful tools that are being used increasingly. When aided by the intelligent, but not Draconian, use of financial carrots they are an effective means of changing practice. Positive trials, such as those of thrombolytic therapy, have rapidly resulted in the widespread use of such treatment. Negative trials, for example those involving anti-arrhythmic prophylaxis after myocardial infarction or the use of calcium antagonists in patients with impaired left ventricular function, have also correctly resulted in an appropriate change in practice. Advertising does not always reflect best clinical practice and could lead to under-promotion of older but more useful drugs. Peer review and audit are probably the best available methods for promoting good clinical practice.",

However, despite these positive results, a brief glance at the published mortality data or an hour spent in any heart failure clinic easily demonstrates that the problems of heart failure are far from being solved. Among the unresolved issues that will be addressed in this brief review are: the high incidence of deaths due to pump failure and sudden death in patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy; methods of further improving exercise tolerance and quality of life, and, finally, current views regarding prevention of heart failure.", 
    "169": "In a double-blind, parallel-group study, 260 patients with mild to severe essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with placebo or spirapril at 6, 12 or 24 mg once daily for 6 weeks. When blood pressures were measured at the end of the dosing interval (trough), all spirapril regimens had produced similar reductions in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures (siSBP/siDBP) which were significantly greater than those observed in placebo-treated patients. There were no relevant changes in resting heart rate in any of the study groups. At the study endpoint, the mean reductions in siSBP/siDBP were 14.9/11.5 mmHg with spirapril at 6 mg, 15.4/12.0 mmHg with spirapril at 12 mg and 17.8/12.4 mmHg with spirapril at 24 mg/day vs. 3.1/3.6 mmHg with placebo. In a subgroup of 122 patients, blood pressure was recorded at the end of the dosing interval and during the 8 hours immediately postdose to monitor the peak effects on blood pressure. All spirapril dosages produced similar reductions at peak with a mean decrease of siDBP of approximately 20 mmHg in comparison to baseline values vs 6-7 mmHg with placebo. The trough:peak ratios for 6, 12 and 24 mg all lay between 60% and 90% for siSBP and siDBP, indicating that most of the peak effect was maintained at trough. Spirapril was well tolerated; the adverse event profile was not different from that with placebo, and no dose-related adverse events were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

After a 3 (or 4)-week placebo wash-out period followed by 6 weeks of active treatment with spirapril at either 3, 6, 12 or 24 mg once daily (or placebo), DBP decreased by approximately 10 mmHg in the (pooled) spirapril-treated patients compared with approximately 5 mmHg with placebo. There were statistically significant differences between all active-treatment groups (except the 24-mg dose group) and placebo, but not among the spirapril groups at the end of the +24-hour dosing interval. Reported adverse events were mostly not study drug-related and were similar to those with placebo except for headache, which was more frequent with spirapril than placebo (5.8% vs 1.7%, respectively). Similarly, the number and severity of the changes in laboratory variables did not differ between placebo vs spirapril, and none of these changes were dose-related. In conclusion, the studied dosages of spirapril were equally effective in reducing DBP, and the overall good decrease in blood pressure at the end of the dosing interval indicates that once-daily administration is effective in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.",

Measurements of blood pressure and heart rate as well as exercise-testing were performed after 2 weeks of treatment each with placebo and spirapril. Anginal attacks and consumption of short-acting nitrates were recorded in the patients' diaries. Resting blood pressure was not significantly reduced (143 +/- 20/89 +/- 10 mmHg vs 138 +/- 17/87 +/- 10 mmHg). The exercise-induced ST-segment depression, the main criterion for anti-ischaemic effect, was 2.17 +/- 1.72 mm after placebo and not significantly affected by spirapril (2.03 +/- 1.47 mm) despite a significant reduction in blood pressure x heart rate product at maximum workload (213 +/- 45.4 vs 197.5 +/- 36.8; p < 0.05). The number of anginal attacks per week and nitrate consumption remained virtually unchanged. A significant reduction of exercise-induced ischaemia in normotensive patients with CAD was not demonstrated with spirapril.", 
    "172": "Spirapril is a prodrug that is converted by esterolysis to the active (but poorly absorbed) diacid spiraprilat. After intravenous infusion, the disposition of spirapril is monophasic with a terminal half-life of 20-50 minutes. Plasma clearance was 56 l/h and renal clearance was 11 l/h; the volume of distribution was 28 litres. After intravenous infusion of spiraprilat, the disposition was biphasic with half-lives of 2 hours and 35 hours, respectively. Plasma clearance of spiraprilat was 10 l/h, of which 7.6 l/h was cleared by the kidneys. The volume of distribution was 43 litres. The bioavailability of orally administered spirapril was 50% whereas the bioavailability of orally administered spiraprilat was virtually zero. There was a significant first-pass metabolism of spirapril after oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of spirapril were linear within the dose range of 6-50 mg whereas the disposition of spiraprilat was non-linear with respect to the terminal phase. Variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters of spiraprilat were significantly less than that of spirapril. Plasma concentrations of both spirapril and spiraprilat were increased by 30% in the elderly. Similarly, in patients with impaired liver function, plasma concentrations of spiraprilat were reduced by 30%. In patients with severe renal impairment, spiraprilat concentrations were significantly increased by a factor of 3-4.

    "173": "To assess the long-term course of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and haemodynamic changes during spirapril treatment, 11 male hypertensive patients with a left ventricular mass (LVM) > 240 g and a mean age of 48 (range 41-60) years were followed-up with echo-Doppler examinations for 36 months. The initial spirapril dose was 6 or 12 mg once daily, which was titrated to a minimum of 3 mg and a maximum of 24 mg to keep diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < or = to 95 mmHg. Patient compliance based on tablet counts was 98% (range 95-100%). The mean spirapril dose was 9 +/- 6 mg at 3 months, 9 +/- 6 mg at 12 months, and 15 +/- 9 mg at 36 months. Blood pressure was reduced from 161 +/- 20/107 +/- 6 mmHg at baseline to 137 +/- 11/89 +/- 6 mmHg at 3 months (p < 0.001), 141 +/- 20/89 +/- 4 mmHg at 12 months and 135 +/- 11/87 +/- 6 mmHg at 36 months. The respective values for LVM at baseline and at 3, 12 and 36 months were 340 +/- 71 g, 305 +/- 61 g (p < 0.05 vs baseline), 303 +/- 88 g and 298 +/- 94 g. Cardiac output did not change whereas systemic arteriolar resistance (SAR) was significantly reduced after 3 and 36 months (p < 0.01). Thus, the regression of LVH with spirapril was 10% of LVM at 3 months, 11% at 12 months, and 12% at 36 months. These changes were mainly related to a reduction of LV posterior wall thickness and SAR.", 
    "174": "In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 20 patients with mild to severe essential hypertension received 3 weeks of treatment with each of four dosages of spirapril (3, 6, 12 and 24 mg once daily) or placebo. Standing and supine blood pressures were measured by use of both an automatic oscillometric instrument (Dinamap) and a mercury sphygmomanometer over a 24-hour period. Spirapril at 6, 12 and 24 mg once daily produced similar reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. At most time points, there was a statistically significant difference between the reductions with spirapril compared with placebo. Spirapril at 3 mg once daily was less effective than the higher dosages, producing a lower mean blood pressure reduction and a shorter duration of antihypertensive action, mainly as regards systolic pressure. Spirapril was well tolerated and no patients withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. These data suggest that, although all four evaluated spirapril dosages effectively lowered supine and standing blood pressure in patients with mild to severe hypertension, the blood pressure-lowering effect of the 3 mg/day regimen was less than optimal. There were only minor variations in efficacy between dosages > or = to 6 mg/day, which may be attributable to the variability of blood pressure. Further investigations of larger numbers of patients are required to verify these results.", 
    "175": "In a single-blind trial with a 2-week placebo run-in phase and a 4-week active-treatment period, spirapril at 6 mg once daily was administered to 49 consecutive hypertensive patients (34 men and 15 women). All had pretreatment diastolic blood pressures (DBP) of 95-115 mmHg and varying degrees of renal impairment. At the end of the placebo run-in and at the end of active treatment, renal function was assessed using the following procedures: technetium 99m-DTPA clearance [for glomerular filtration rate (GFR)]; radioiodine (131I)-labelled sodium iodohippurate (Hippuran) clearance [for renal plasma flow (RPF)]; creatinine clearance (Clcr). No statistically significant differences were found in GFR or Clcr during spirapril treatment. In renally impaired patients, RPF remained virtually unchanged whereas, in patients with normal Clcr, there was an increase of around 10% during active treatment. At the end of the study, 48% of the patients with renal failure achieved normalization of DBP (< or = 90 mmHg) and/or a DBP reduction of > or = 10 mmHg; the corresponding rate for patients with normal renal function was 31%. In conclusion, in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and varying degrees of renal impairment, spirapril at 6 mg once daily is an efficacious and well tolerated antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "176": "In this single-blind trial with a 2-week placebo run-in followed by a 4-week active-treatment period, patients were given 6 mg of spirapril once daily. Forty-nine hypertensive men and women were recruited; all had pretreatment diastolic blood pressures (DBP) of 95-115 mmHg with varying degrees of renal impairment. Regression analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters C(max)ss (the maximum steady-state drug concentration in plasma during a dosing interval), Cl/f (total plasma clearance) and k (elimination rate constant) of spirapril on creatinine clearance (Clcr) showed that the pharmacokinetics of spirapril were not significantly influenced by the degree of renal impairment. C(max)ss values of spiraprilat, however, increased with decreasing Clcr, and AUC(l)ss (area under the concentration-time curve during a dosing interval) values also increased. Regression analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters C(max)ss, Clm/fm (total plasma clearance) and lambda 1 (rate constant of the first disposition phase) of spiraprilat on Clcr showed that Clm/fm as well as lambda 1 were linearly correlated with Clcr (p < 0.01). However, the results indicate that, even when renal elimination is completely blocked, there is significant elimination of spiraprilat through a non-renal pathway. In conclusion, the risk of drug accumulation after multiple dosing is minimal as the presence of a substantial non-renal spiraprilat elimination was consistently demonstrated.",

A 3-week placebo run-in period was followed by a 5-week active-treatment period during which patients received either 1, 6, 12 or 24 mg of spirpril once daily. Predose sitting blood pressure was taken in the morning by sphygmomanometer as well as by an automatic device (Tonoprint). Spirapril in doses of 6, 12 or 24 mg once daily significantly and similarly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP compared with 1 mg once daily. The rates of blood pressure normalization (DBP < or = 90 mmHg) were 12.5%, 37.5%, 30.8% and 28.9% with 1, 6, 12 and 24 mg, respectively. The percentage of patients experiencing a DBP reduction of at least 10 mmHg was 25.0%, 56.3%, 48.7% and 52.6% and 1, 6, 12 and 24 mg of spirapril, respectively. No serious or severe adverse events related or uncertain if related to the study medication were observed. The effective 6-mg dose was as well tolerated as the inefficacious 1-mg dose. In conclusion, in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, 6 mg of spirapril once daily is an efficacious and safe antihypertensive therapy with a favourable benefit-risk profile.", 
    "178": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a recognized complication of, rather than a physiological response to, hypertension, being a powerful independent indicator of cardiovascular disease risk. In addition, it is reasonable to assume that the reversal of LVH is a desirable therapeutic goal in the treatment of hypertension. Furthermore, the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in LVH and, in particular, in the development of cardiac interstitial fibrosis. Therefore, the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on LVH is of particular interest. In both experimental and human studies, ACE inhibitors appear to perform better than other antihypertensive agents in reversing cardiac structural changes. A recent meta-analysis showed ACE inhibitors to be more efficacious than other first-line antihypertensives in reducing left ventricular mass. A controlled long-term study of previously untreated men showed that enalapril reversed LVH significantly better than did hydrochlorothiazide and that the regression of LVH was independently related to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Indeed, there have been studies showing that ACE inhibitors can affect LVH without lowering blood pressure. Moreover, ACE inhibitors have shown cardioprotective and cardioreparative properties in experimental models of hypertensive LVH. In conclusion, ACE inhibitors are effective in reversing LVH as well as interstitial fibrosis. The prognostic implications of this remain to be seen. So far, the experience with spirapril on LVH is limited, but the accumulated data are promising.", 
    "179": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of patient groups, including those with chronic renal disease. In addition to their antihypertensive efficacy, there is recent evidence suggesting that ACE inhibitors may have renoprotective properties, particularly in cases of diabetic nephropathy wherein the glomerular filtration rate may be better preserved by ACE inhibitors than by other antihypertensive drugs. Although the potential benefits of ACE inhibitors are recognized, many physicians are concerned about their possible harmful effects in patients with renal disease as most ACE inhibitors are eliminated by the kidney; there is a perceived risk of progressive drug accumulation leading to toxic effects. Whether or not ACE inhibitors have a unique renoprotective effect remains to be clearly established by further long-term clinical studies. Nevertheless, in patients with hypertension and renal impairment (with the particular exception of renovascular disease), ACE inhibitors have an established efficacy and safety. If there is concern over drug accumulation in patients with impaired renal function, those ACE inhibitors (such as spirapril) with dual routes of elimination would then appear to be the agents of choice.",

Following a 4-week placebo run-in phase, 52 male and female outpatients, aged 23-67 years with mild to severe essential hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 100 mmHg and < 120 mmHg] were randomized to receive spirapril at either 3 mg or 12 mg once daily for 8 weeks. At the end of active treatment and using the standard mercury sphygmomanometer, the number of responders (sitting DBP < 90 mmHg, but decrease > or = 10 mmHg) was the same in both groups (32% and 37%). There were mean decrease in both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP at trough with both 3 mg and 12 mg doses: -9/-7 mmHg and -12/-7 mmHg, respectively. The rate of normalization (trough DBP < or = 90 mmHg) was 12% and 30% with the 3 mg and 12 mg doses, respectively. Of the 44 patients whose daytime ABPM could be compared, one of 20 patients taking 3 mg of spirapril, and 9 of 24 taking 12 mg of spirapril achieved a DBP < or = 90 mmHg for all time intervals while awake. The differences in blood pressure-lowering were significant with both SBP and DBP during the day and at the end of the dosing interval (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively).

No statistically significant effects of renal impairment upon the disposition of spirapril were detected. In contrast, there were significant perturbations in the pharmacokinetics of spiraprilat: The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values in the severely renally impaired group were 2-3 times those in the group of patients with normal renal function whereas the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values were 5-6 times higher. However, there was no evidence of accumulation of spiraprilat in any of the groups as determined by the pharmacokinetic parameters derived after single and multiple doses. Thus, despite the evidence of a significant influence of renal impairment upon the disposition of spiraprilat, the lack of accumulation during the translation from single to multiple doses indicates that there is a considerable margin of safety for spirapril in renal impairment.",

    "184": "A multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed in 39 adult patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy with the aim of comparing the effects of the ACE inhibitor fosinopril and placebo on proteinuria. All patients had normal blood pressure and normal renal function. Proteinuria ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 g/24 h. After a 3-month run-in period, fosinopril and placebo were randomly administered in two 4-month sequences separated from cross-over treatment by a 1-month interval. The mean values of creatinine clearance did not change during either the placebo or the treatment sequences. The mean values of mean arterial pressure (MAP) were significantly lower during the fosinopril sequence (90.4 +/- 9.0 mmHg) than in basal conditions (92.8 +/- 9.1 mmHg) (P = 0.034). The mean basal values of proteinuria were 1.74 +/- 0.84 g/24 h. They were unchanged during the placebo sequence (1.79 +/- 1.20) and fell to 1.37 +/- 0.98 g/24 h after 4 months of fosinopril treatment. Using a multivariate statistical analysis, the treatment effect by time on proteinuria was significantly evident only in the fosinopril sequence (Wilks test, P = 0.033). Changes in protein excretion were not correlated with changes in MAP, baseline plasma renin activity, and urinary sodium excretion. This controlled study shows that fosinopril can significantly reduce proteinuria even in normotensive patients with IgA nephropathy. Obviously, the results of treatment with ACE inhibitors on long-term renal prognosis remain to be elucidated.", 
    "185": "Elevated serum levels of the atherogenic and thrombogenic lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) have been recognized as a feature of the nephrotic syndrome associated hyperlipidaemia. To examine a possible relationship between serum Lp(a) concentration and proteinuria, serum albumin, or blood pressure, we studied nine patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria both at baseline and after various forms of antihypertensive and antiproteinuric treatment. In fixed order, patients received conventional antihypertensive treatment (either alpha-methyldopa or clonidine), subsequently ACE-inhibition therapy (lisinopril), ACE inhibition combined with an NSAID (indomethacin), and finally NSAID plus conventional antihypertensive therapy. Measurements were performed at the end of each 2-month study period. When compared to controls (n = 29), proteinuric patients before treatment showed increased levels of total cholesterol, very-low and low-density lipoprotein (VLDL+LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (apoB), while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) HDL cholesterol was lower. Lp(a) was significantly higher in patients (107 (95% CI: 55-208) mg/l) as compared to controls (25 (13-49) mg/l, P < 0.01). Conventional antihypertensive treatment did not reduce proteinuria, while Lp(a) remained unaffected. ACE-inhibitor treatment lowered proteinuria, raised serum albumin, while La(a) tended to fall (-11 +/- 8%). Addition of an NSAID induced a further fall in proteinuria and a rise in serum albumin. Lp(a) now fell by 40 +/- 5% from baseline values (P < 0.01). Both serum total, HDL and VLDL+LDL cholesterol fell significantly. Finally, during subsequent single therapy with NSAID most parameters, including proteinuria and Lp(a), returned towards values obtained during single therapy with ACE inhibiton.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "186": "Lithium and free water clearance (CLi and CH2O) were measured simultaneously in 5 patients with Bartter's syndrome (BS), and the results were compared with values obtained in a large group of healthy control subjects. In line with the literature, fractional diluting segment reabsorption estimated from CH2O appeared to be subnormal in BS (82.4 +/- 4.7 versus 89.4 +/- 4.4% in controls, p < 0.01). Fractional delivery to this segment, expressed as the maximum urine flow during water diuresis (Vmax/glomerular filtration rate, GFR), also appeared to be reduced (11.3 +/- 1.6 versus 13.8 +/- 2.5%, p < 0.05), suggesting compensatory increased proximal reabsorption. In disagreement with the latter, CLi/GFR, alleged to be a measure of fractional sodium and water output from the proximal tubules, was increased (36.2 +/- 1.8 versus 30.7 +/- 5.1% in controls, p < 0.01), suggesting that suppressed proximal reabsorption could be the primary reabsorption defect in BS. During chronic converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril, given to treat hypokalemia (3 patients), the concordance between the two methods was restored because CLi/GFR fell by approximately 50%, whereas VMax/GFR did not change; the alleged diluting segment reabsorption defect remained present. These contradictory results lead to the conclusion that one of the two methods reflected the pattern of tubular sodium handling in BS incorrectly. However, the present study does not unequivocally indicate which method yielded erroneous results in this condition.", 
    "187": "Cough is known to be the major respiratory side effect of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). Recently, ACEI have been implicated in drug-induced lung disease. We report a new case of diffuse pneumonitis which occurred during treatment with ACEI. A 73-year-old man was admitted for cough, dyspnea at rest, fever and weight loss. The patient had been treated with the ACEI pirindopril during 6 months for systemic hypertension. Chest radiographs showed reticular infiltrates in the upper lung fields. A CT scan confirmed the infiltrates and showed pleural thickening and airspace opacities. White blood cell counts showed 15,700/mm3 leucocytes with 940 eosinophils/mm3. Transbronchial biopsy was consistent with infiltration of the lung with eosinophils. There was no evidence for another etiology. Once the drug was withdrawn, clinical and radiological abnormalities improved but steroids were required to control symptoms. This report suggests that pirindopril, as captopril, can induce the picture of drug-induced pulmonary disease.", 
    "188": "Cultured mesangial cells (MC) express renin mRNA and generate angiotensin I, supporting the action of local renin-angiotensin system. Also angiotensin II may act like a growth factor and was reported to increase collagen production (CP) in cultured MC. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is suggested to attenuate development and advancement of glomerulosclerosis, mainly with its hemodynamic effects. Therefore, we investigated the direct effects of enalapril (E) on CP by cultured MC. Rat MC were cultured in DMEM media alone, or containing high glucose (HG: 25 mM) or soluble immune complex (IC) prepared with bovine gamma globulin (BGG) and anti-BGG, with or without E (0.2 microgram/ml). CP was determined after 24 h by [3H] proline incorporation method. E significantly reduced CP by 43% in medium as compared with control (C) (C: 37,210 +/- 4,200 vs C + E: 21,350 +/- 5,080 cpm/well, p < 0.01). CP in medium increased in the presence of HG (123% of C) or IC (147% of C), which was, however, prevented with E (HG + E: 105% of C, IC + E: 116% of C). There were no differences of CP in cell layer between C (3,490 +/- 220 cpm/well) and C + E (3,340 +/- 190 cpm/well), and also no changes after addition of E in HG or IC groups. In conclusion, E directly attenuates CP by MC, even in the presence of HG or IC, independently of its hemodynamic effects.", 
    "189": "Angiotensin converting enzyme plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and inhibitors of the enzyme are effective antihypertensive agents. An association between hypertension and alcohol abuse has long been recognized and manipulations of the renin-angiotensin system in laboratory animals has been shown to alter their consumption of ethanol. Procedures that decrease the renin-angiotensin system increase ethanol consumption. Paradoxically, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme also diminish drinking. Several possible explanations for this observation have been proposed. However, observations on the relationship between stress-induced drinking and the antidipsogenic action of a fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone suggest another possibility: angiotensin converting enzyme may be involved in the metabolism of this peptide and thereby exert an influence on drinking behavior.", 
    "190": "The activity was studied of enkephalinase (endopeptidase 24.11, neutral endopeptidase)--a membrane enzyme of epithelial cells within human digestive tract (in the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon, and rectum). The enzyme activity was determined by column method using the labelled substrate (H-D-AlaLeu)--enkephalin and the selective enkephalin inhibitor--thiorfan in the presence of bestatin and captopril--inhibitors of aminopeptidases and angiotensin converting enzyme respectively. The highest enkephalinase activity was found in the duodenal epithelium (77.3 8.0 fmol of the substrate/min/mg of protein) and in the small intestine (23.4 0.9 fmol/min/mg of protein) with its gradual decrease when progressing down the gastrointestinal tract. This result confirms the hypothesis of enkephalinase participation in protein hydrolysis processes.", 
    "191": "Previous studies indicate that captopril, an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor, attenuates cardiomyopathy in a murine viral myocarditis model. Accordingly, we investigated the ability of captopril as well as angiotensin II (AII) and losartan, a nonpeptide AII receptor antagonist, to alter infection or replication of herpes simplex virus- type 2 (HSV-2) in cultured cardiac and vero cells. Neither captopril nor AII influenced the ability of HSV-2 to replicate in either cell type. Losartan, however, caused a dose dependent decrease in pfu ability on vero cells with an ED50 of 1.35 mM. In cultured myocytes, losartan (400 microM) reduced significantly %LDH released (54.9 +/- 7.5 vs 29.1 +/- 4.2 in infected controls) and % pfu released (40.9 +/- 8.4 vs 14.8 +/- 3.8 in infected controls) into the media. These results suggest that losartan attenuates deleterious effects of the virus by preventing release of the virus by the cells.", 
    "192": "Ingestion of the anticonvulsant drug valproic acid and of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril during pregnancy has been associated with abnormal fetal outcome in humans. In contrast, the use of the antiinflammatory drug ibuprofen and the antihistamine diphenhydramine has not been documented to be embryotoxic in humans. We evaluated the rat embryo culture system as a predictive model of teratogenesis, using these four drugs as test agents. Valproic acid, ibuprofen, and diphenhydramine were embryotoxic, inducing concentration-dependent decreases in growth and a significant increase in anomalies. Valproic acid caused an increase in neural tube defects, ibuprofen increased the incidence of abnormal maxillary processes, and diphenhydramine increased the number of embryos with distorted body morphology. These abnormalities were induced at concentrations of valproic acid and diphenhydramine that are used clinically, but ibuprofen only induced toxicity at concentrations greatly exceeding the therapeutic range. Captopril was not embryotoxic up to 5 mM, the highest concentration tested. These results suggest that the rat embryo culture system produces both false positive and false negative data on the teratogenic potential of drugs. Although such an in vitro assay may be suitable to determine the mechanism of teratogenesis, it is not a sensitive indicator of potential human teratogens on its own. These data support the view that in vitro systems can only supplement clinical and epidemiological observations in humans, possibly as a method to determine mechanisms of actions of teratogens.", 
    "193": "1. To examine the possibility that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors modulate the action of bradykinin at the receptor level, their effect on the dilator response to bradykinin was studied in the isolated saline-perfused heart of the rabbit. 2. Continuous infusion of bradykinin (10 nM) elicited a transient decrease in coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) and increased prostacyclin (PGI2) release which returned to baseline values within 30 min. 3. Subsequent co-infusion of ramiprilat (> or = 10 nM) or moexiprilat, but not of the less potent ACE inhibitor n-octyl-ramipril (RA-octyl), caused another fall in CPP and an increase in PGI2 release, the magnitude and time course of which were almost identical to the first response to bradykinin. No change in CPP or PGI2 release was observed when the ACE inhibitors were administered in the absence of exogenous bradykinin. 4. Infusion of D-Arg[Hyp3]-bradykinin (10 nM), a specific B2-receptor agonist which was significantly more resistant to degradation by ACE than bradykinin, produced virtually identical changes in CPP and PGI2 release when compared to bradykinin. Subsequent co-infusion of ramiprilat was similarly effective in restoring the fall in CPP and increase in PGI2 release elicited by D-Arg[Hyp3]-bradykinin as in the presence of bradykinin. 5. In concentrations which should block the degradation of bradykinin by ACE in the coronary vascular bed, two ACE substrates, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (0.2 mM) and angiotensin I (0.3 microM), were unable to elicit a significant change in CPP or PGI2 release while ramiprilat and another ACE inhibitor, quinaprilat, were still active in the presence of these substrates. 6. To reveal the potential B2-receptor action of ramiprilat, its effect on the constrictor response to bradykinin was studied in the rabbit isolated jugular vein. Ramiprilat (0.1 MicroM), but not RA-octyl (1 MicroM),potentiated the endothelium-independent, B2-receptor-mediated constrictor response to bradykinin, but not that to the thromboxane-mimetic U46619 (9,11-dideoxy-ll alpha,9 alpha-epoxymethano-prostaglandin F2.).Moreover, ramiprilat but not RA-octyl caused a concentration-dependent, B2-receptor antagonist sensitive increase in tone when administered alone.7. These findings suggest that an interaction of ACE inhibitors with the B2-receptor or its signal transduction pathway rather than an accumulation of bradykinin within the vascular wall is responsible for the restoration of the endothelial response to bradykinin (dilatation, PGI2 release) in the coronary vascular bed of the rabbit.",

A small rise in the disappearance rate of glucose (Kg) was also observed following enalapril (placebo 2.09 +/- 0.33 and enalapril 2.56 +/- 0.53). The insulin responsiveness to glucose increased significantly from 0.16 +/- 0.020 during placebo to 0.21 +/- 0.023 during enalapril.

The relative activities towards [Leu5]enkephalin, substance P, VIP, and neurotensin were approximately 7.7, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.54, respectively. The VIP degradation was inhibited by metal chelators EDTA and o-phenanthroline. CaCl2 at 0.3-1.0 mM enhanced VIP degradation up to twofold. Phosphoramidon, captopril, and bestatin, the specific inhibitors for endopeptidase-24.11, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and aminopeptidase M, respectively, did not affect VIP degradation significantly. However, the complex mixtures of VIP fragments generated implicates action of multiple peptidases including the aforementioned three peptidases and other unidentified peptidase(s).", 
    "199": "The central effects of atenolol (50 mg tds) and captopril (50 mg tds) ingested for a period of seven days were studied in ten healthy volunteers. A placebo and two active control drugs, methyldopa (250 mg tds) and oxazepam (10 mg), were included in the design. Oxazepam was ingested on the seventh day only, with a placebo being taken on the preceding six days. On the seventh day, central effects of the drugs were tested at 10.00-11.00 h (session 1), immediately before the subjects' last dose of each drug and at 2.5-3.5 h after the final dose of each drug (1330-1430 h, session 2). Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. Recordings of the EEG and body sway were carried out. Neither atenolol nor captopril altered performance at any of the skills tested. There were no effects on subjectively assessed alertness or mood with captopril, while atenolol significantly increased wakefulness in session 2 and when the two sessions were meaned. Similarly, captopril did not modify body sway, while with atenolol there was a significant decrease in activity in the frequency range 1.0-2.75 Hz from session 1 to session 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "201": "Traditionally, drugs that are capable of inducing pemphigus are divided into two main groups according to their chemical structure, in particular, the existence of a sulfhydryl group in their molecule. Thus, two groups are formed: (1) drugs containing a sulfhydryl radical (thiol drugs or SH drugs) and (2) nonthiol or other drugs. Much emphasis has been put on the role of the sulfhydryl group in the pathogenesis of drug-induced pemphigus. The effects of this group have been extensively studied, and a logical paradigm on the mode of its action has been created. However, no attempt has been made to search for other biochemical radicals which might have an influence on the activation/triggering of this disease. The aim of the present report is to draw attention to a chemical group common to the molecule of several drugs that have been associated with the induction of pemphigus. Careful analysis of the chemical structure of nonthiol drugs known to induce pemphigus revealed that several of them share an active amide group in their molecule. We believe that this group might be responsible for the induction of the disease; thus, a third group of drugs capable of triggering pemphigus can be formed, namely drugs containing an active amide group. Several drugs of this group are discussed.", 
    "202": "The development of drugs in order to block metabolic pathway of glucose responsible for diabetic vascular dysfunction is in progress. Aldose reductase inhibitors prevent or reduce the different components of vascular dysfunction, cataract, neuropathy and nephropathy in animal models of diabetes. Promising results have been observed in diabetic patients concerning the prevention of neuropathy and of retinopathy. Larger scale studies with the second generation compounds are in progress. Glycation inhibitors, mainly aminoguanidine, have been shown to prevent or reduce vascular dysfunction and microvascular complications in animal models. Trials in diabetic patients with aminoguanidine are just beginning. Anti-oxidant therapy is also at its early stage of development (vitamin E, vitamin C, alpha lipoic acid). Antiplatelet agents (aspirin, ticlopidine) have been demonstrated to reduce the progression of non proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are of particular interest in preventing diabetic glomerulopathy.", 
    "203": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single oral doses of 5 mg ramipril and 6 mg piretanide administered separately and in combination were determined in a single blind, randomised, 3-period cross-over study in 24 healthy male volunteers. The peak plasma concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilat increased slightly (from 11.9 to 14.8 ng/ml, and from 6.39 to 8.96 ng/ml, respectively) as did the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of ramipril (0-4 h) and ramiprilat (0-24 h) (from 15.8 to 19.8 ng.ml-1.h, and from 63.4 to 74.6 ng.ml-1.h, respectively). The urinary excretion of ramiprilat also rose (from 6.82 to 7.73% of dose) following simultaneous treatment with piretanide. These effects were probably due to reduced first-pass metabolism of ramipril/ramiprilat to inactive metabolites. The blood pressure lowering effect, the time course of inhibition of ACE activity in plasma and the concentration-response relationship for the inhibition of plasma ACE activity were not affected by piretanide. The peak plasma concentration of piretanide was somewhat reduced (from 285 to 244 ng/ml) following simultaneous treatment with ramipril. No other pharmacokinetic parameter was affected. Piretanide increased urine flow, and sodium, chloride and potassium excretion, especially during the first 2 hours following administration. These pharmacodynamic parameters were not affected by ramipril. Thus, simultaneous administration of single oral doses of ramipril and piretanide caused modest changes in the peak and average plasma concentrations of both drugs, which did not lead to detectable alterations in the pharmacodynamic parameters measured in healthy volunteers.", 
    "204": "To prevent drug accumulation and adverse effects the dose of hydrophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, e.g. lisinopril, must be reduced in patients with renal failure. To obtain a rational basis for dose recommendations, we undertook a prospective clinical trial. After 15 days of lisinopril treatment pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined in patients with advanced renal failure (n = 8; endogenous creatinine clearance [CLCR]: 18 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2) and in healthy subjects with normal renal function (n = 16; CLCR: 107 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2). The volunteers received 10 mg lisinopril once daily, the daily dose in patients (1.1-2.2 mg) was adjusted to the individual CLCR according to the method of Dettli [13]. After 15 days of lisinopril treatment the mean maximal serum concentration (Cmax) in patients was lower than in volunteers (30.7 vs 40.7 ng.ml-1, while the mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-24 h) was higher (525 vs 473 ng.h-1.ml-1). ACE activity on day 15 was almost completely inhibited in both groups. Plasma renin activity, angiotensin I and angiotensin II levels documented marked inhibition of converting enzyme in volunteers and patients. Furthermore, average mean arterial blood pressure in patients decreased by 5 mmHg and proteinuria from 3.9-2.7 g per 24 h after 15 days of treatment with the reduced dose of lisinopril. Adjustment of the dose of lisinopril prevents significant accumulation of the drug in patients with advanced renal failure during chronic therapy. Mean serum levels did not exceed this in subjects with normal renal function receiving a standard dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "205": "Lisinopril has been compared with slow-release nifedipine in a 16-week double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study involving 102 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced 6 and 5 mmHg more by lisinopril than by nifedipine over 12 weeks monotherapy. After 12 weeks a greater proportion of patients taking lisinopril was controlled (sitting diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg) than in those taking nifedipine. As a result, 17% of those taking lisinopril and 38% of those taking nifedipine required additional therapy with hydrochlorothiazide. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide resulted in similar response rates in the lisinopril and nifedipine groups (89% and 75% respectively). The rate of reporting of adverse events considered to be drug-related and the rate of withdrawals were similar for both treatments. Cough was more often reported with lisinopril and headache, sweating, and hot flushes with nifedipine. We conclude that once-daily titrated doses of lisinopril produced better control of blood pressure than twice-daily titrated doses of nifedipine.",

The cause of myocarditis resulting in peripartum cardiomyopathy remains yet unknown. An immunosuppressive therapy can be associated with the treatment of the congestive heart failure.", 
    "207": "The regression of structural and functional alterations in the hypertrophic left ventricle was measured in the course of long-term correction of arterial pressure with a new inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme ingibeis (chilasapril) in 23 patients with essential hypertension stage II-III. The results were for the most part obtained at echocardiography providing basic hemodynamic parameters and those of left ventricular diastolic function. Adaptability of the hypertrophic myocardium in response to physical loading was studied dynamically under isometric exercise test. The findings proved high efficacy of chilasapril in monotherapy of arterial hypertension. Long-term (6 months) therapy of left ventricular hypertrophy provides regression of the latter and improves left ventricular diastolic function, pumping capacity. In the course of arterial hypertension correction relevant patients with associated coronary heart disease improved their condition, demonstrated less frequent ECG changes indicative of ischemia.", 
    "208": "In the present study, the role of sensory neuropeptides in the airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was investigated. First, the effect of the depletion of sensory neuropeptides by systemic capsaicin treatment on the AHR to acetylcholine (ACh) induced by repeated antigenic challenge to sensitized rats was studied. We secondly investigated whether the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity was altered at the antigen-induced AHR. Male Wistar rats were sensitized and repeatedly challenged with DNP-Ascaris antigen. Twenty-four hours after the last antigenic challenge, a marked AHR to inhaled ACh (0.001-0.03%) was observed. This AHR was significantly attenuated by systemic capsaicin pretreatment prior to sensitization. On the other hand, in normal rats, the airway responsiveness to inhaled ACh was significantly increased by pretreatment with NEP inhibitor, phosphoramidon (3 mg/kg, i.v.), but the NEP inhibitor-induced effect was no more observed in the antigen-induced AHR rats. Furthermore, it was found that the airway NEP activity was significantly decreased at the antigen-induced AHR. These findings suggest that NEP hypoactivity and resultant increased sensory neuropeptides have an important role in the pathogenesis of antigen-induced AHR in rats.", 
    "209": "It has not been determined previously whether patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure differ in demographic characteristics with respect to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVD). In patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure in NYHA IV, an optional protocol in the CONSENSUS-I trial was designed to ascertain whether there were any differences in patient characteristics regarding the degree of LVD defined as left ventricular fractional shortening (FS). A subgroup of 54 patients from the CONSENSUS-I trial were evaluated with M-mode echocardiography. Patients with FS above median (14%) were older (74 +/- 7 vs. 68 +/- 7, p < 0.01), more often female (48 vs. 15%, p < 0.05) and had lower heart rates (77 +/- 15 vs. 95 +/- 17, p < 0.01). Analysis of the 2-year follow-up from the end of the trial was also performed. In the placebo group, patients with FS > 14% had significantly better prognosis than patients with FS < 14%. In the enalapril-treated group no such difference in survival was seen. The difference between the original treatment groups remained, despite the fact that treatment with enalapril was then made available to all surviving patients. In conclusion, patients with advanced chronic congestive heart failure and less severe LVD have different demographic characteristics than patients with more severe LVD. In the placebo group, but not in the enalapril group, prognosis was better in patients with less severe LVD.",

Angiotensin II binding was very low in the cortical and medullary areas in the thymus of newborn rats and was no longer detected in the thymus of 4- and 8-week-old rats. No detectable binding for the ACE inhibitor [125I]351A was observed in the thymus of the rat, regardless of the age studied.

To determine the origin of urinary ANG(1-8), mean arterial pressure, renal hemodynamics and the arterial, renal venous and urinary concentrations of ANG(1-8) were examined prior to and following the constant intra-arterial infusion of tritiated angiotensin II [3H-ANG(1-8)] in graded doses of 0.5, 2.0 and 2.5 ng/kg/min in 5 uninephrectomized, anesthetized female dogs. The infusion of 3H-ANG-(1-8) had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow or urine flow rate. The mean concentration of ANG(1-8) in the urine was 3.7 fmol/ml. None or only trace amounts of 3H-ANG(1-8) were detected in the urine in spite of marked increases in renal arterial 3H-ANG(1-8) concentrations. These observations suggest that urinary ANG(1-8) was derived de novo from the intrarenal generation of angiotensin II. In addition, plasma and urinary concentrations of ANG(1-8) were assessed in patients with essential hypertension undergoing treatment with either a diuretic (n = 14) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 14). Although the concentrations of plasma ANG(1-8) responded appropriately to the respective therapies, the urinary excretion of ANG(1-8) was not different following either therapy. These data suggest that ANG(1-8) collected from the urinary bladder may not occur in adequate concentrations to accurately assess the activity of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "214": "The effects of inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and glycopyrrolate on cough caused by inhaled capsaicin were investigated in a double-blind, randomised cross-over study in twelve normal volunteers. The capsaicin challenge was performed before and 2 h after dosing with 75 mg captopril or matched placebo given orally, and 20, 40 and 60 min after giving 1 mg glycopyrrolate i.v. to each subject. Captopril and placebo did not alter the cough response when compared to baseline. Glycopyrrolate, however, caused a significant increase in the threshold sensitivity (D2) from baseline, and a significant decrease in the total cough response at 40 and 60 min both after captopril and placebo. The D2-baseline and D2-40 min after glycopyrrolate (mean SD), respectively, were 3.2 (1.0); 17.9 (4.2) after placebo and 2.5 (8.5); 23.6 (6.9) after captopril. Elimination of vagal influences implies attenuation of the effects of tachykinins but not those prostaglandins. We postulate that tachykinins, such as substance P, play a more important role than prostaglandins in capsaicin-induced cough. We conclude that the vagus is important in the capsaicin-induced cough reflex, but, as suppression of this reflex by glycopyrrolate was delayed, the relevant receptors are either poorly accessible peripheral receptors or they are located in the central nervous system.", 
    "215": "Fifty patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive either 20 mg fosinopril daily for 16 weeks or placebo for 4 weeks followed by 12 weeks of 50 mg atenolol daily. Prior to these 16 weeks there was a placebo wash-out period of 2-6 weeks. Blood pressure measurements, euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamps, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) were performed at baseline and after 4 and 16 weeks. Blood lipid status was evaluated at baseline and 16 weeks. The insulin sensitivity index (M/I) increased by 12% during the prolonged placebo period, and subsequently decreased by 12% during treatment with atenolol in that group. A post-hoc analysis of covariance indicated that the increase in insulin sensitivity during the initial 4 weeks may have been due to carry-over effects from previous antihypertensive treatment. Fosinopril increased glucose disappearance during IVGTT at 4 and 16 weeks (k values 1.46 and 1.33 vs 1.10 at baseline) but had no effect on insulin sensitivity. The change in insulin sensitivity and serum triglycerides during treatment with fosinopril was related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in serum. In conclusion, carry-over effects from previous antihypertensive medication were indicated in this study, probably because of an insufficient wash-out period in many patients. Therefore, 4 weeks of placebo wash-out in all patients is advisable in this kind of investigation.", 
    "216": "The study objective was to obtain detailed information on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of the new fixed combination of delapril and indapamide following single and multiple dosing. For this reason, the study was performed in two parts, separated by a medication-free period of at least 7 days. In the single dose part, one tablet, containing 30 mg delapril and 2.5 mg indapamide, was administered to 12 male volunteers; in the multiple dose part, the volunteers received one tablet of the test preparation, once daily over 7 days. Following single and on the last day of the multiple dosing regimen, blood samples were withdrawn and serum concentrations of delapril and its metabolites M1, M2 and M3 and whole blood concentrations of indapamide were quantified by means of HPLC methods. In addition, urine samples were collected following single and multiple dosing for evaluation of the cumulative amount of delapril and its metabolites M1-M3 excreted in urine. For the area under the curve, calculated from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) the study revealed, following single dosing, mean values of delapril and its metabolites M1, M2 and M3 of 281, 2178, 739 and 716 h.ng/ml, respectively; for indapamide the mean value was 1597 h.ng/ml. The corresponding mean values found after multiple dose administration were 272, 2071, 857 and 598 h.ng/ml for delapril and its metabolites, respectively and 1536 h.ng/ml for indapamide. Evaluation of the cumulative amount of delapril and its metabolites M1-M3 excreted in urine (Ae) demonstrated mean values following single dosing (observation period 36 h) of 705, 4521, 454 and 4203 micrograms, respectively; the corresponding values after multiple dose administration (observation period 24 h) of the test preparation were 655, 4679, 469 and 4801 micrograms, respectively. The most important pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0-infinity) and Ae were statistically compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 90% confidence intervals were calculated. It may be concluded from the results of this study, that the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters of the test preparation after single dosing and after multiple doses correspond well. The undesired side effects observed are known to occur after administration of the test preparation. The occurrence was a little more frequent after multiple dose application in comparison with the single dose administration.", 
    "217": "Both nitrendipine and captopril have been shown to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients. So far, no study allowed a true comparison of these drugs in this regard and with respect to their potential of reducing circadian blood pressure. Therefore, a total of 86 patients with newly diagnosed arterial hypertension and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy underwent randomized treatment with captopril (n = 43) or nitrendipine (n = 43). Eighteen patients had to be put on a combination therapy of nitrendipine and captopril during the course of the study to control blood pressure effectively. Before and after the 6th and 38th weeks of treatment all patients underwent ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, M-mode echo assessment of left ventricular mass and Doppler evaluation of left ventricular filling. The 24-hour blood pressure data were smoothed with a Fourier series and then compared with a normotensive reference profile with respect to blood pressure load and variability. The daytime and nighttime mean and the office blood pressure were also analyzed. Substance-specific profiles of action were obtained by subtracting the smoothed profiles after therapy from the profiles before therapy. After 38 weeks ambulatory blood pressure had decreased from 152 +/- 11/101 +/- 7 to 137 +/- 13/87 +/- 10 mm Hg on nitrendipine and from 147 +/- 11/99 +/- 6 to 134 +/- 13/89 +/- 9 mm Hg on captopril. The substance-specific profiles calculated for captopril and nitrendipine showed a balanced antihypertensive effect throughout the day and the night. The mean percentage decreases in left ventricular muscle mass under nitrendipine was 15% and did not differ significantly from the decrease of 21% under treatment with captopril (p < 0.001). There is no significant association between the reduction in blood pressure and the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. In patients with disturbances of left ventricular diastolic function the early-to-late diastolic left ventricular flow ratio and the isovolumetric relaxation time were improved independent of the drug used. It is concluded that a long-term therapy with captopril and nitrendipine leads to a comparable degree of circadian blood pressure reduction and regression of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "218": "This study was designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine (AML) and ramipril (RAM) administered once a day in patients affected by mild to moderate primary systemic hypertension. Twenty outpatients, 12 men and 8 women (age range 35-64 years), were enrolled. The patients received single-blind placebo for 2 weeks and thereafter in a double-blind, randomized crossover sequence AML (10 mg) and RAM (5 mg), both for 4 weeks. At the end of each period, the patients underwent 24-hour noninvasive blood pressure monitoring with readings taken every 10 min during daytime (from 07.00 to 23.00 h) and 20 min during nighttime (from 23.00 to 07.00 h). Both AML and RAM induced a highly significant (p < 0.0001) decrease in blood pressure from 162/103 +/- 7/3 to 132/82 +/- 6/6 and 135/83 +/- 6/5 mm Hg, respectively. The mean blood pressure decreased from 122 +/- 5 to 99 +/- 6 (AML; p < 0.0001) and 100 +/- 5 mm Hg (RAM; p < 0.0001). No significant differences in heart rate were noted during drug administrations. Treatment did not have to be discontinued in any patient because of adverse reactions. In conclusion, both AML and RAM reduced the blood pressure markedly, even if AML proved to be significantly more effective than RAM.", 
    "219": "Clinical observations demonstrate an enhanced risk for myocardial infarction in patients with sustained activation of the local and/or systemic renin-angiotensin system, such as a high renin-sodium profile or a heritably enhanced expression of angiotensin converting enzyme. Chronic renin-angiotensin system blockade by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in patients with moderate heart failure reduces the rate of myocardial infarction and reinfarction. Preliminary experimental evidence suggests that these clinical observations may be partially explained by a proatherogenic effect of an activated renin-angiotensin system, which can downregulate the endothelial releasability of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide exerts many potentially antiatherogenic effects on endothelium, platelets and low density lipoproteins and indirectly on monocytes and leukocytes. Hypertension-induced chronic distension of elastic arteries upregulates the local renin-angiotensin system in these arteries and thereby downregulates nitric oxide releasability. Enhanced local synthesis of the trophic factor angiotensin-II and reduced releasability of the antitrophic factor nitric oxide appear to cooperate in the trophic adaptation of the distended vessel wall to the enhanced load, but with the disadvantage of enhanced susceptibility for atheroma development due to reduced releasability of nitric oxide. Chronic blockade of the renin angiotensin system by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or by angiotensin receptor type-1 antagonists normalizes a reduced endothelial releasability of nitric oxide in several models, partially by a bradykinin-dependent mechanism. This endothelial protection proved to attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis in experimental models. The antiatherogenic potential of renin angiotensin system blockade in humans is presently under study.", 
    "220": "Antiproteinuria effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was studied in 23 patients with chronic nephritis (CN) and 32 patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). CN patients received Capoten, DN patients were given enalapril. The drugs were also examined for the action on systemic arterial pressure, renal function and intrarenal hemodynamics. Significantly decreased urinary excretion of protein occurred in DN patients on the treatment month 1, in CN subjects on month 3. In both groups ACE inhibitors produced marked hypotensive effect, did not affect renal function, noticeably improved intraglomerular hemodynamics. Hypotensive and antiproteinuria activity of the drugs were unrelated. The mechanism of antiproteinuria action of ACE inhibitors works via normalization of intrarenal hemodynamics. Systemic arterial hypertension seems to be an additional factor aggravating disturbances of intrarenal circulation and provoking proteinuria.", 
    "221": "Several different strategies have been followed to block the activity of renin, the enzyme catalysing the first and rate-limiting step in the renin-angiotensin cascade. The unique substrate specificity of this enzyme makes it an attractive target for specifically interfering with the renin-angiotensin system. Attempts to block the activity of renin in animals by an immunological approach, with either active or passive immunization against renin, have been successful. This approach has not been considered as a realistic therapy in humans for the treatment of hypertension or heart failure, but has provided useful tools for purifying and quantifying renin. Considerable efforts have been focused on the design of orally active, synthetic inhibitors of renin. This has resulted in the discovery of low molecular weight pseudo-tetrapeptide compounds that are resistant to enzymatic cleavage and are potent and selective inhibitors of renin. Studies in animal models and preliminary studies in humans indicate that renin inhibitors have the same therapeutic potential as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. However, the generally poor oral bioavailability and rapid elimination of currently available renin inhibitors have prevented their development as useful drugs. Inhibitors with better oral bioavailability and a long duration of action are needed to assess their full therapeutic potential and to determine whether they offer advantages over the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or the more recently developed angiotensin II-receptor antagonists.", 
    "222": "A new ultrasensitive chemiluminoenzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) using digoxigenin-labeled bradykinin (BK) as a tracer is proposed to quantify kinins in tissue samples. Rabbit polyclonal IgGs anti-BK directed against the C-terminal end were used for the immunoconcentration step along with dioxetane derivative for the revelation step. The sensitivity of the assay for BK was 0.1 fmol/ml with ED50 of 0.78 pmol/ml. This method was applied on extracts of normal and carrageenan-inflamed tissues. The edema produced by the injection of carrageenan in rat hindpaws was associated with a sevenfold increase of immunoreactive kinins in the inflamed paw extract (from 0.021 +/- 0.007 to 0.141 +/- 0.021 pmol/g tissue; p < 0.01), the immunoreactivity corresponded to BK, kallidin, and T-kinin after HPLC separation. When a mixture of inhibitors of kininase I (mergepta) and kininase II (captopril) was coinjected with carrageenan, the carrageenan-induced edema was unaffected but the kinin tissue content was significantly enhanced (0.207 +/- 0.003 pmol/g tissue; p < 0.01). However, the kinin tissue content and the edema response were unaltered by inhibitors given separately. Hence, this highly sensitive assay provides a biochemical evidence that kinins may act as proinflammatory mediators, and highlights a compensatory increase of kininase I and II activities in inflamed tissues.", 
    "223": "The antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in patients with renal disease is well known, but the results of clinical studies appear to vary considerably from a partial decrease to a fall of 100% in urinary protein excretion. This may have been due to the use of different doses of ACE inhibitor, different renal pathology and non-standardized sodium intake. In 16 proteinuric patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, with normal renal function and blood pressure, maintained at controlled sodium intake < or = 80 mEqII, the efficacy of increasing doses of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril was studied. The lisinopril doses were 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg, administered for 4 weeks. Between each dose increment a placebo period of 3 weeks was interposed. Proteinuria stepwise decreased from the control period by 39%, 44%, 61% and 67% with lisinopril at 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg, respectively. The blood pressure decreased by 22% with lisinopril 5 mg; a similar fall was observed with the dose increment. Although the glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged, the renal plasma flow increased by 21%, 26%, 24% and 28% and the filtration fraction increased by 28% mean. The ACE plasma levels decreased by 33%, 64%, 76% and 83%. A close correlation was found between an increase in lisinopril dosage and the fall in urinary protein excretion (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The antiproteinuric effect of lisinopril is dose-related and may be attributable to some extent to the fall in systemic (and intraglomerular) blood pressure, but it is best attributed to the modification of glomerular sieving function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "224": "In a double-blind, parallel-group multicentre study, the efficacy and safety of a fixed low-dose combination of ramipril 2.5 mg and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) 12.5 mg was compared with each of the component drugs when given as monotherapy. After a four-week placebo run-in, patients were randomized to receive either ramipril 2.5 mg (n = 218) or HCT 12.5 mg (n = 220), or the fixed-dose combination of ramipril 2.5 mg and HCT 12.5 mg (n = 222), for a period of eight weeks. At the end of the study, in which 624 patients had completed treatment, it was found that the decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (the main efficacy parameter) was greater in the ramipril-HCT combination group than in either the ramipril or the HCT monotherapy groups, the difference being statistically significant when compared with the HCT group (-14.3, -13.1 and -12.4 mm Hg, respectively). Reductions in standing DBP and supine and standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) were also greatest in the combination group. The incidence of adverse events was lower in the combination group than in either of the monotherapy groups, and there were no serious clinically significant laboratory abnormalities in the combination group.", 
    "225": "Leukotriene B4 formation can take place by cell interaction between keratinocytes and neutrophils. Thus, keratinocytes without proven 5-lipoxygenase activity can transform neutrophil-derived leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether human epidermis is able to transform leukotriene A4 sequentially into the peptide leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4). Epidermis isolated using the suction blister technique or keratomed skin specimens were incubated with either neutrophils or exogenously added leukotriene A4. Peptide leukotrienes were determined by integrated optical density after RP-HPLC separation, and the identity of leukotrine C4 was confirmed by (1) the retention time similarity with authentic leukotriene C4; (2) the UV spectrum determined with an on-line diode array detector; and (3) conversion by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase of the peak coeluting with authentic leukotriene C4 into a new peak coeluting with authentic leukotriene D4. The results of this study showed that while human epidermis cannot form detectable amounts of peptide leukotrienes by itself, it can transform exogenous leukotriene A4 into peptide leukotrienes. Furthermore, coincubation of human epidermis and neutrophils resulted in a marked increase (90%) in peptide leukotriene formation when compared with neutrophils alone, indicating that human epidermis can transform neutrophil-derived leukotriene A4 into peptide leukotrienes. These results indicate that human skin contains leukotriene C4 synthase activity capable of producing significant amounts of leukotriene C4 from leukotriene A4, and that the keratinocytes may play a more active role in peptide leukotriene formation in the skin than previously thought.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "226": "A 61-year-old man developed renovascular hypertension characterized by nephrotic-range proteinuria. When he was treated with a calcium channel blocker, glomerular filtration fraction was 0.26 and massive proteinuria ranging from 10 to 15 g/day persisted. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor markedly reduced the proteinuria to 1-2 g/day with a filtration fraction of 0.20. After the antihypertensive drug was switched to a beta-blocker, the filtration fraction was 0.23 and urinary protein excretion was 3-4 g/day. Blood pressure control was comparable by each drug. These findings suggest a role of intraglomerular hydraulic mechanism in the etiology of massive proteinuria in renovascular hypertension.", 
    "227": "In addition to efficacy and safety, the cost of therapy has become an increasingly important factor to consider when selecting drugs to treat patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. However, acquisition prices alone do not determine the total cost of therapy. To better assess total costs, we conducted a systematic, retrospective, cost-minimization analysis of drugs used to treat 673 patients with newly diagnosed, mild-to-moderate (> 95 to < 110 mmHg) diastolic hypertension between the years 1985 and 1992. Patients included in the study had started antihypertensive monotherapy, and a minimum of one dose titration was required before adding another antihypertensive agent to the regimen. A patient had to have a diastolic blood pressure of < or = 90 mmHg while undergoing therapy to be included in the analysis. Drug classes included diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, centrally acting alpha 2-agonists, alpha 1-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Costs, adjusted to 1992 price levels, were analyzed for 32 individual agents for each of the following five cost variables: initial drug acquisition, supplemental drug acquisition, laboratory monitoring, clinic visits, and treatment of side effects. Mean total costs per patient for all five variables by drug class were $895 for beta-blockers, $1043 for diuretics, $1165 for centrally acting alpha 2-agonists, $1243 for ACE inhibitors, $1288 for alpha 1-blockers, and $1425 for calcium channel blockers. However, costs within each class varied considerably. Acquisition cost was often a poor predictor of the total cost of treatment. Therefore, acquisition cost must be considered in conjunction with a number of outcome variables to assess the true cost of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "228": "Early reperfusion therapy, usually in the form of intravenous thrombolysis, is accepted as the standard therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction. While thrombolytic therapy has been conclusively shown to reduce mortality, a large percentage of patients are not candidates for this therapy and, even in those who are candidates, as many as 25-30% have persistent occlusion or reocclusion of the infarct-related artery. Adjunctive pharmacologic therapy evolved in an attempt to address these issues and is given in addition to reperfusion therapy. Adjunctive therapy includes administration of one or more of the following: aspirin, heparin, beta-adrenergic blockers, nitroglycerin, heart-rate slowing calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Data are emerging that indicate that some of these agents provide additional reduction in morbidity and mortality when used as adjunctive strategies. Currently, a recommended combination includes, at minimum, soluble aspirin, intravenous heparin, an intravenous beta-blocking agent, and oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.",

Of the 179 patients with anaphylaxis (mean age, 36 years), 66% were female, 49% had atopy, and 37% had a previous history of immediate reactions to allergens. Of these study patients, 11 were receiving medications capable of exacerbating anaphylaxis (beta-blockers in 7 of them).", 
    "231": "Consultation with an allergist was obtained in 142 cases, and a probable diagnosis was made after review of the medical records. Causes of anaphylaxis included foods in 59 patients, idiopathic in 34, Hymenoptera in 25, medications in 23, and exercise in 12; false-positive diagnoses were recorded in 18. Allergy prick tests were done in 104 patients, 71 of whom had positive results; allergen-specific IgE tests were done in 44 patients, 23 of whom had positive results. In 19 patients, only allergen-specific IgE testing was done, and results were positive in 12. Normal test results included C1 esterase inhibitor in 33 patients, metabisulfite challenge in 15, and dye or preservative challenge in 10. Food skin tests were graded on a relative value scale and revealed 15 highly allergic, 24 moderately allergic, and 39 weakly allergic food groups.", 
    "232": "A standard protocol should be used for assessment of patients with anaphylaxis, and fresh food extracts should be used for prick skin testing. A national incidence study of anaphylaxis is needed.

    "233": "Several neuropeptides, including neurotensin, somatostatin, bradykinin, angiotensin II, substance P, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone but not vasopressin and oxytocin, were actively metabolized through proteolytic degradation by cultivated astrocytes obtained from rat cerebral cortex. Because phenanthroline was an effective degradation inhibitor, metalloproteases were responsible for neuropeptide fragmentation. Neurotensin was cleaved by astrocytes at the Pro10-Tyr11 and Arg8-Arg9 bonds, whereas somatostatin was cleaved at the Phe6-Phe7 and Thr10-Phe11 bonds. These cleavage sites have been found previously with endopeptidases 24.16 and 24.15 purified from rat brain. Addition of specific inhibitors of these proteases, the dipeptide Pro-Ile and N-[1-(RS)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-4-aminobenzoate, significantly reduced the generation of the above neuropeptide fragments by astrocytes. The presence of endopeptidases 24.16 and 24.15 in homogenates of astrocytes could also be demonstrated by chromatographic separations of supernatant solubilized cell preparations. Proteolytic activity for neurotensin eluted after both gel and hydroxyapatite chromatography at the same positions as found for purified endopeptidase 24.16 or 24.15. In incubation experiments or in chromatographic separations no phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase) or captopril-sensitive peptidyl dipeptidase A (angiotensin-converting enzyme) could be detected in cultivated astrocytes. Because astrocytes embrace the neuronal synapses where neuropeptides are released, we presume that the endopeptidases 24.16 and 24.15 on astrocytes are strategically located to contribute significantly to the inactivation of neurotensin, somatostatin, and other neuropeptides in the brain.", 
    "234": "Cilazapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, controls blood pressure (to 90 mm Hg or less) in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension within 2-3 weeks of initiating treatment (2.5-5.0 mg once daily); this effect was maintained in long-term observations over 1 year. Hemodynamic investigations demonstrated that the antihypertensive action of cilazapril is induced mainly by a decrease of peripheral vascular resistance accompanied by a decrease of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Furthermore, cilazapril decreased left ventricular mass index in essential hypertensive patients within 6 months of therapy at doses of 2.5-5.0 mg once daily, thus reversing left ventricular hypertrophy induced by hypertension. In other studies cilazapril was shown to ameliorate glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic hypertensive patients, and in hypertensive diabetic patients improvement of renal function was observed. Incidence and severity of side effects caused by cilazapril were comparable to those seen by other ACE inhibitors. Although experimental data provide evidence for vascular, antiatherosclerotic protection by cilazapril, these effects must be proven by long-term prospective studies in humans.", 
    "235": "Traditionally, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been viewed as an endocrine system. Recently, independent tissue RASs have been postulated that are believed to act in a paracrine/autocrine fashion. Elements of the RAS have been shown to exist in many peripheral tissues. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a key element of the RAS, is found mainly in the vascular endothelium and therefore represents the main target site for inhibition of the local and circulating RASs. In the heart, angiotensin II exerts a direct positive inotropic and chronotropic effect. More recently, it was also found that angiotensin II may act as a growth factor in several cell types. Angiotensin II is also thought to be partially responsible for structural remodeling in cardiac hypertrophy. The role of ACE inhibitors has been established in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Recent multicenter trials revealed a beneficial role of ACE inhibitors in reduction of mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure and a low ejection fraction. Mechanisms that include reduction of myocardial oxygen demand, improvement of coronary blood flow, induction of capillary proliferation, reduction of blood pressure and ventricular wall tension without reflex tachycardia, and impairment of myocardial contractility are the basis for the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors. In addition to a reduction of angiotensin II generation, these effects appear to be largely brought about by the inhibition of endogenous kinin degradation. Recent studies suggest that a deletion polymorphism in the gene encoding ACE is a risk factor in myocardial infarction (MI).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "236": "Arterial hypertension is one of the few factors confirmed to accelerate the development of renal failure. Conversely, several studies have documented that systematic reduction of the blood pressure slows the progression of renal failure. It is postulated that 24-h reduction of the blood pressure should be achieved, best controlled by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and that the elevated blood pressure should be reduced to at least below 140/90 mm Hg. In assessing the progression of renal failure, the renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate are measured, because both renal hemodynamic parameters correlate with the degree of severity of histologic changes. Renal blood flow is increased by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and unchanged or slightly increased by calcium antagonists, whereas renal plasma flow is somewhat decreased by diuretics and beta-blockers. A further criterion for assessing the potential nephroprotective properties of antihypertensive agents is their influence on intraglomerular hemodynamics. According to animal studies, ACE inhibitors can prevent elevated intraglomerular pressure and the associated development of glomerulosclerosis. Retrospective and prospective studies could also demonstrate these findings in human subjects. Despite an equally effective reduction of systemic blood pressure by the antihypertensive medication, there was a lesser reduction in glomerular filtration rate with ACE inhibitors than when another conventional antihypertensive medication was used. It should be further clarified whether these favorable effects of ACE inhibitors were due also to antiproliferative properties (e.g., blockade of the growth-stimulating factor angiotensin II). The results for calcium antagonists are contradictory. Their protective properties in acute renal failure have been documented, but there are no clinical studies verifying the effect of long-term administration of calcium antagonists on the development of renal failure. To summarize, it has been confirmed to date that systemic antihypertensive therapy slows the progression of renal failure of any etiology, and there is initial proof that ACE inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive agents in this respect.", 
    "237": "Obesity is the most common reason for insulin resistance with consequent hyperinsulinemia. Other reasons for hyperinsulinemia are type II diabetes mellitus and a genetic predisposition with a family history of hypertension. Hyperinsulinemia is considered to cause blood pressure elevation and is generally accepted as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. However, insulin per se does not elevate blood pressure, but rather reduces total peripheral vascular resistance in experimental studies. Blood pressure might be elevated by other mechanisms secondary to hyperinsulinemia, however, such as enhanced renal sodium retention, elevated intracellular free calcium, and increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Indeed, subjects whose blood pressure is salt-sensitive exhibit hyperinsulinemia after glucose loading, and normotensive subjects with glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia will develop hypertension within 5 years more often than normoinsulinemic subjects. In primary hypertension, the incidence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia is much higher than in normotensive controls. However, not all reported studies show a relationship between hyperinsulinemia and blood pressure elevation, and in some experimental studies no blood pressure elevation could be induced by prolonged hyperinsulinemia. Therefore, it is still unclear whether hyperinsulinemia induces hypertension or is only casually associated with it. Nevertheless, treatment of hyperinsulinemia is recommended to avoid secondary complications. Treatment should begin with weight reduction and physical exercise, which will improve insulin resistance. Hypertension benefits more from weight reduction than from exercise. If drug therapy of hypertension is required, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers are the drugs of first choice. In addition, beta-blockers and centrally acting drugs appear to be of certain benefit. However, diuretics must be used carefully, because they ameliorate insulin resistance, induce dyslipoproteinemia, and stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "238": "General use of ambulatory noninvasive 24-h blood pressure monitoring in many patients has shown that new criteria for arterial hypertension are useful. A classification of circadian blood pressure in \"dippers\" and \"nondippers\" (no physiologic drop of blood pressure) needs to be specified. An altered circadian blood pressure profile, like that in nondippers, was used as a diagnostic criterion for secondary hypertension. Recent epidemiologic studies in patients with essential hypertension have shown that nondippers are at higher risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular insult. The studies also revealed that sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) are characterized by increased cardiovascular risk. Increases in blood pressure caused by SRBD could be documented, with the highest amount occurring during REM sleep. A study performed in a general practice showed a high incidence (40/112) of nondippers in a group of snoring middle-aged men with obesity and daytime fatigue. This indicates diagnostic and therapeutic consequences for the control of 24-h blood pressure, including nocturnal breathing pattern and daytime symptoms due to SRBD. The goal of antihypertensive drug therapy is to reduce blood pressure significantly during the day and during the night in different stages of wakefulness and sleep. A new protocol was designed to investigate blood pressure over 24 h under a standardized load, including nocturnal hypertension. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor cilazapril was used in this test procedure and showed a significant and clinically relevant mean blood pressure reduction of 10.0 mm Hg (versus placebo 4.3 mm Hg) over 24 h.", 
    "239": "Several studies were performed to evaluate the degree of inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by an ACE inhibitor by assessing the blood pressure response to a continuous i.v. infusion of increasing doses of angiotensin I in healthy volunteers. We assessed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-blocker propranolol in healthy volunteers and patients with essential hypertension. We also evaluated the effect of cilazapril on aortic compliance in hypertension by pulse-wave velocity along the aorta. We showed that single oral doses of cilazapril 4 mg, captopril 25 mg, or enalapril 10 mg shifted the angiotensin I dose-effect curve to the right and determined a pharmacologic half-life of about 4 h for cilazapril. Increasing single oral doses (1.25, 3.75, 10, and 30 mg) of cilazapril reduced diastolic blood pressure dose-dependently and shifted the angiotensin I dose-response curves to the right. The dose representing 50% inhibition of ACE activity (apparent Ki dose) was about 0.6 mg 3 h after cilazapril administration. Cilazapril and propranolol did not exhibit significant pharmacokinetic interaction in healthy volunteers; each drug reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure by about 7 mm Hg, and this was doubled by the combination. Monotherapy with each drug reduced blood pressure, and combined administration enhanced the antihypertensive effect. The reduction in cardiac output and the increase in total peripheral resistance induced by propranolol were attenuated by the cilazapril-propranolol combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "240": "As a risk factor, arterial hypertension favors the progression of renal failure and promotes cardiovascular complications, leading to early death. Progressive renal failure can be delayed or halted in glomerular diseases, and damage to other end organs can be avoided, by effective measures to lower blood pressure. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to be especially suitable as antihypertensive medications, because they may have specific renoprotective properties. Diuretics are required when a volume expansion caused by retention of salt and water occurs in more severe restriction of the glomerular filtrate. After ruling out contraindications and with cautious individualized dosages of antihypertensives (especially ACE inhibitors), deterioration of kidney function resulting from therapy is very rare.", 
    "241": "Experimental studies have identified local renin-angiotensin systems in a variety of tissues. The importance of these systems is indicated by the evidence that, in genetic models of hypertension in the rat, blood pressure is elevated by the renin gene independently of changes in plasma levels of renin. Trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in human left ventricular dysfunction indicate that they improve the mortality from myocardial infarction (MI); high plasma renin activity is associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction (MI), and an ACE gene allele increases the risk for death from MI. These data point to the importance of the renin-angiotensin system in both ischemic heart disease and hypertension, even without increased circulating levels of plasma renin. The degree to which ACE inhibitors are beneficial as a result of hemodynamic actions on the heart and coronary tree and the extent to which they affect local tissue systems independently of their hemodynamic effect still remains to be clarified.", 
    "242": "The antihypertensive, cardioprotective, and renoprotective effects of a nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist (AIIA, CV-11974) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI, captopril) were compared in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Six-week-old male rats received a high-salt diet (4% NaCl) and were divided into control, CEI, and AIIA groups. The CEI group received captopril (15 mg/kg/day) and the AIIA group received CV-11974 (0.72 mg/kg/day), an active metabolite of the AIIA TCV-116, for 4 weeks by continuous subcutaneous infusion. After 4 weeks, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly lower in the treatment groups than in the control group. The heart weight/body weight ratio and urinary protein excretion were reduced in the treatment groups, and renal damage (glomerular sclerosis score) was reduced by approximately 50%. CV-11974 and captopril were comparable in reducing BP, cardiac hypertrophy, and renal damage, suggesting that the renin-angiotensin (R-A) system is involved in elevating BP and promoting cardiovascular damage, despite suppression of the R-A system in this model. The antihypertensive effect of CEI may be due primarily to inhibition of the action of angiotensin II, while other effects, e.g., potentiation of the kinin system, may be less important.", 
    "243": "Angiotensin II (AII) appears essential in remnant kidney models of renal injury in rats, and renal injury was reduced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). To determine whether this is due to AII blockade or other actions of ACEI, we studied a nonpeptide AII type 1 receptor antagonist and an ACEI in partially nephrectomised spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Thirty SHR underwent surgery and were divided into three equal groups: Control, TCV (0.5 mg/kg/day TCV-116), and CAP (30 mg/kg/day captopril). All SHR received a 5%-NaCl diet. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary protein were measured at 2-week intervals. Serum total protein, albumin, urea nitrogen, and creatinine were determined at week 8. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) were measured at weeks 4 and 8. Renal injury was evaluated histopathologically. TCV and CAP reduced SBP at week 2 and proteinuria at week 8. GFR and RBF fell in all groups, but decreases were not significant in treated SHR and histopathological changes were significantly ameliorated. All blockade by TCV or CAP reduces renal injury in salt-loaded SHR with partial renal ablation. AII is essential in remnant kidney models of renal injury, and AII blockade is essential in renal protection by ACEI.", 
    "244": "Arterial injury by a balloon catheter produces marked smooth muscle cell proliferation and the participation of angiotensin II in this response has been suggested. In this study, we examined the effect of a novel angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, TCV-116, on neointimal formation after rat carotid artery balloon injury. Oral administration of TCV-116 at doses of 1, 5 or 10 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the cross-sectional intimal area by 30%, 46% and 54%, respectively, and reduced the ratio of the intimal to medial cross-sectional areas by 23%, 41% and 50%. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, had an effect similar to that of TCV-116. The effect of both drugs was significantly correlated with the reduction of both blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy. We conclude that TCV-116 can prevent neointimal formation after balloon injury as well as reducing blood pressure and preventing cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "245": "Although the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is known to decrease with age, the antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been demonstrated in the elderly. To examine the role of the renin-angiotensin system in hypertension in the elderly, we evaluated the antihypertensive response to enalapril and to TCV-116, an angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist, in elderly patients with essential hypertension. A single oral dose of enalapril (10 mg) increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and reduced the angiotensin II concentration, whereas a single oral dose of TCV-116 (4 mg) increased both PRA and the angiotensin II concentration. Blood pressure was significantly reduced by these drugs from 4 h after administration. Basal levels of PRA and angiotensin II declined with age. However, the changes in blood pressure produced by either TCV-116 or enalapril did not correlate with age. These results suggest that the activity of the renin-angiotensin system in plasma declines with age, and that the extrarenal renin-angiotensin system may play a role in hypertension in the elderly.", 
    "246": "To evaluate the biosynthesis of the type-1 angiotensin II (AT1) receptor and the regulation of AT1 receptor subtypes in the rat adrenal gland, we performed non-radioisotope in situ hybridisation histochemistry with an AT1 receptor complementary RNA (cRNA) probe and a messenger RNA (mRNA) probe. The levels of AT1A and AT1B receptor mRNAs were measured by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method after 4-week treatment with a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, TCV-116, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, delapril. Specific hybridisation signals were observed with the cRNA probe in both the cortex and medulla of the rat adrenal gland. An especially strong signal was observed in the zona glomerulosa. TCV-116 did not affect the levels of expression of AT1A and AT1B receptor mRNAs in the adrenal gland. Delapril, on the other hand, significantly reduced the levels of expression of AT1A and AT1B receptor mRNAs. These results indicate that the sites of biosynthesis of the AT1 receptor are mainly distributed in the adrenal zona glomerulosa. The observed differences in levels of expression of AT1 receptor mRNAs following treatment with TCV-116 and delapril suggest the involvement of the AT2 receptor in the regulation of AT1 receptor subtypes.", 
    "247": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke and heart disease in the elderly. Eighty-one hypertensive subjects with mild cognitive impairement, aged over 70 years, were drawn from a community screening programme and randomized to either 12.5 mg captopril twice daily or 2.5 mg bendrofluazide daily in a double-blind trial. Subjects were excluded if they had previously received antihypertensive treatment. The mean blood pressure was reduced from 193/101 mmHg to 154/87 mmHg by captopril and from 188/102 mmHg to 151/89 mmHg by bendrofluazide after 24 weeks; there was no significant difference between the two drugs. Seven subjects withdrew due to adverse events. Adverse events occurred more frequently during the 2-week placebo phase than during active treatment with either drug. The only significant detrimental changes in pre-existing conditions were in 3 subjects (2 captopril, 1 bendrofluazide) who were noted to have worsening of their cataracts. One subject on captopril and 4 subjects on bendrofluazide became hypokalaemic. The trial results support the use of captopril as an alternative to bendrofluazide as a first-line antihypertensive agent in the community for elderly people, but large studies are required to measure accurately effects on significant morbidity and mortality.", 
    "248": "The randomized single-blind study was designed to compare the effects of captopril (Cap) and nadolol (Nad) on renal hemodynamics in 60 patients with essential hypertension. They were divided into two groups at random. Cap was given in dosage of 37.5-75 mg/d per os and Nad 40-80 mg/d. The results show that both drugs increase the blood volume distributed to the kidneys from cardiac output (renal blood flow/cardiac output), Cap increasing 10% (P < 0.05) and Nad 8% (P < 0.05). Renal vascular resistance (RVR) is lowered by the two drugs, 13% (P < 0.05) by Cap and 11% (P < 0.05) by Nad. These suggest that both drugs facilitate the maintenance of renal blood circulation in patients with essential hypertension, being beneficial for long-term treatment of hypertension.", 
    "249": "Twenty two healthy males participated in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over study to investigate the influence of simvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of ramipril and its active metabolite (ramiprilat), and on the ACE-inhibiting effect of ramiprilat. During two study periods, each of 7 days, subjects received daily either simvastatin 20 mg at 19.00 h or placebo; ramipril (5 mg) was given on Day 5 of each of the periods. Plasma concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilat and ACE-activity were measured in sequential blood specimens, and ramipril and ramiprilat concentrations were measured in urine. Blood and urine collections for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment were made up to 72 h after the dose of ramipril. The mean AUC of ramipril for ramipril+placebo (R+P) and ramipril+simvastatin (R+S) was 22.2 and 21.3 ng.h.ml-1, respectively; for ramiprilat the corresponding figures were 61.3 and 57.6 ng.h.ml-1. The urinary excretion of ramipril+metabolites for (R+P) and (R+S) was 25.2 and 24.1% of dose. The maximum percentage inhibition of ACE-activity for (R+P) was 94.6%, and for (R+S) it was 94.1%. It is concluded that concomitant administration of simvastatin and ramipril has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or ACE-inhibition of the latter drug and its metabolites.", 
    "250": "Pharmacokinetic interaction between benazepril (ACE inhibitor) and amlodipine (calcium channel blocker) was studied in 12 healthy subjects. Single doses of benazepril hydrochloride (10-mg tablet) and amlodipine besylate (tablet equivalent to 5 mg amlodipine) were administered alone or in combination according to a three-way, Latin-Square, randomized cross-over design. Serial blood samples were collected following each administration for the determination of benazepril and its active metabolite benazeprilat and amlodipine. The mean values of AUC (0-4 h), Cmax and Tmax for benazepril given as combination versus given alone were 161 vs 140 ng.h.ml-1, 168 vs 149 ng.ml-1, and 0.5 vs 0.6 h. The mean values of AUC (0-24 h), Cmax and Tmax for benazeprilat after benazepril given as combination versus given alone were 1470 vs 1410 ng.h.ml-1, 292 vs 257 ng.ml-1, and 1.7 vs 1.5 h. The mean values of AUC (0-144 h), Cmax and Tmax for amlodipine given as combination versus given alone were 118 vs 114 ng.h.ml-1, 2.5 vs 2.3 ng.ml-1, and 8.3 vs 9.0 h. The differences in these pharmacokinetic parameters between the combination and monotherapy treatments were not statistically significant based on ANOVA. The results of this study indicate that no pharmacokinetic interaction existed between the two drugs.", 
    "251": "The burden of cardiac disease in dialysis patients is high. Congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and systolic dysfunction occur frequently and are associated with an adverse prognosis. In addition, during dialysis therapy anemia, hypoalbuminemia, low blood pressure, and lower serum creatinine levels are adverse predictors of mortality. Risk factors for systolic dysfunction include older age, ischemic heart disease, hyperparathyroidism, and smoking. Risk factors for left ventricular hypertrophy include older age, hypertension, anemia, and diabetes mellitus. Interventions with potential for improving cardiomyopathy include normalization of hematocrit with erythropoietin, improved uremia therapy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Trials to determine the most appropriate interventions to reduce the impact of cardiac disease in chronic uremia are urgently required.", 
    "252": "It has been proposed that the suppression of endogenous levels of angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, may result in up-regulation of vascular AT1 receptors. This study evaluated the effects of orally administered enalapril on angiotensin II induced vasoconstriction in the human forearm of patients with mild-moderate hypertension. Patients received in random order, enalapril (20 mg) or matched placebo daily for 2 weeks. Forearm blood flow response to increasing doses of angiotensin II was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography at the beginning of the study and at the end of each 2 week treatment period. Treatment with enalapril significantly reduced plasma angiotensin II levels and supine blood pressure compared to placebo. The percentage reductions in forearm blood flow in the infused arm, in response to the maximum dose of angiotensin II (50 pmol.min-1) were 53.2% at baseline, 51.4% on placebo and 59.5% on enalapril. The differences were not significantly different. This study demonstrates that suppression of plasma angiotensin II does not enhance the response to exogenous intra-arterial angiotensin II in the human forearm of mild-moderately hypertensive patients.", 
    "253": "Renal function in 31 patients with mild to moderate heart failure (NYHA Classes II-III) was studied before and during treatment with ACE-inhibitors. Maximal treatment doses were based on randomization: captopril 3 x 12.5 mg or lisinopril or enalapril, both 1 x 10 mg. Before therapy and at the end of titration phase (after 6 days) glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow were determined from inulin and PAH clearance (steady-state method). In the total study group the median arterial pressure significantly decreased from 94 mmHg to 84 mmHg (p < 0.01), whereas glomerular filtration rate was only moderately, however, significantly reduced from 103 ml/min to 97 ml/min (median values, p < 0.01). Renal blood flow, however, increased from 372 ml/min to 403 ml/min (p < 0.01). Changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFRd) were significantly dependent on those of renal blood flow (GFRd = 0.07 RPFd - 9.2; p < 0.05). All three ACE-inhibitors showed similar changes in glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. Ten of the patients had additionally received cyclooxygenase inhibitors. With respect to severity of heart failure and renal function these patients did not differ from the remaining 21 patients of the group. In both groups, a decrease of glomerular filtration rate was found, however, in those patients who had received acetylsalicylic acid there was no increase of renal blood flow.", 
    "254": "A small, however significant decrease of glomerular filtration rate is already seen in patients with mild to moderate heart failure treated with ACE-inhibitors. Increase of renal blood flow counteracts the decrease of glomerular filtration rate. During concomitant application of acetylsalicylic acid the increase of renal blood flow remains absent.", 
    "255": "Chronic systolic heart failure after coronary heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by an increasing dilatation of the left ventricle and raised intracardial pressures. The higher the NYHA class, the higher are usually preload and afterload of the left ventricle. Concomitantly, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system is stimulated, leading to neurohormonal activation of vasoconstrictive hormones. This will reduce the already depressed myocardial function even more. The addition of ACE-inhibitors to diuretics and digitalis has improved the prognosis of patients with severe and moderate heart failure. Thus, there is no question today that ACE-inhibitors are needed in chronic heart failure, irrespective of the origin. New investigations indicate that diuretics and digitalis are also needed in severe or moderate heart failure. They certainly lead to a decrease of symptoms. The significance of the local ACE-system seems to be greater than that of the circulating ACE-system, when chronic heart failure after myocardial infarction has to be treated. The prophylactic use of ACE-inhibitors after myocardial infarction with decreased ejection fraction will reduce the necessity of admittance to hospital and will also improve the prognosis.", 
    "256": "Endothelial function of epicardial arteries and coronary resistance vessels, as well as endothelial dysfunction and clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease and their therapeutic implications are reviewed including the presentation of the author's own results. Coronary endothelial vasodilator dysfunction represents a fundamental functional disturbance in vascular biology with the development of atherosclerosis. This functional alteration in coronary vascular reactivity appears to play an important integral part in the clinical presentation of coronary artery disease. Humoral and neuronal factors in favour of vasoconstrictor influences affect the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, thus, facilitating the manifestation of myocardial ischemia. In order to identify more selective therapies the potential mechanisms underlying an impaired release or activity of EDRF/NO must be considered. Dysfunction of the endothelial L-arginine/NO pathway may involve decreased activity of NO synthase, increased inactivation of NO formed from its precursor L-arginine, impaired signal transduction mechanisms and reduced intracellular availability of L-arginine. Currently, initial therapeutic strategies include the supplementation of L-arginine, the use of antioxidants, as well as ACE-inhibitors. ACE-inhibitors have been shown not only to reduce vascular tone (and hypertrophy) by inhibition of angiotensin II formation, but also by increasing the endothelial production of NO and prostacyclin most likely due to the local accumulation of endothelium-derived bradykinin. Thus, ACE-inhibition appears to provide the potential to improve endothelial NO synthesis. Indeed, study results demonstrate that chronic ACE-inhibition is associated with an increased coronary blood flow response to acetylcholine suggesting an improvement in endothelial vasodilator functioning of coronary resistance vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "257": "Prognosis of patients post-myocardial infarction depends largely on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction, which results from loss of contractile tissue and remodeling of infarcted and surviving myocardium. This remodeling process may result in chronically progressive dysfunction and ultimately in heart failure. Next to mechanical determinants humoral control of hypertrophy, dilatation and qualitative changes of surviving myocardium are discussed. A major determinant of the extent of remodeling is infarct size. Efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on infarct size was tested in animal experiments with conflicting results. Recent clinical studies also report beneficial (GISSI-3 and ISIS-4) or no (CONSENSUS II) effects on survival post-myocardial infarction when ACE-inhibitors were used in the acute phase. Up to date it remains unsettled which patients may benefit from acute therapy with ACE-inhibitors. Three days after myocardial infarction hemodynamically stable patients with heart failure may be treated with ACE-inhibitors (AIRE study). Prognosis may be improved and manifestation of heart failure prevented or delayed also in patients without heart failure treated in this phase of myocardial infarction with ACE-inhibitors (SAVE study). Prevention of heart failure may also be observed in patients treated later (at least 4 weeks) after myocardial infarction (SOLVD prevention arm). It is essential for this indication that patients are carefully selected for treatment depending on left ventricular function. Duration of treatment in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction probably has to be lifelong, the doses of ACE-inhibitors used have to be relatively high (e.g. 3 x 50 mg captopril or 2 x 10 mg enalapril).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "258": "It is known that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only prevent the formation of angiotensin II, but also potentiate the activity of bradykinin. We investigated the effects of the ACE-inhibitor ramipril in two models of cardiac ischemia. In anesthetized dogs with a coronary occlusion of 6-h duration, both ramiprilat and bradykinin significantly reduced infarct-size. This effect was prevented by the co-administration of the bradykinin antagonist HOE 140. In rats with a coronary occlusion of 6-weeks duration, ramipril administration significantly reduced infarct-size and prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, ramipril showed a cardioprotective activity in models of acute as well as of chronic myocardial ischemia. These effects are probably mediated by the potentiation of bradykinin.", 
    "259": "Potential benefit or harm of drug therapy in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and those later presenting to hospital after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been studied in a number of large-scale survival studies during the last few decades. Currently available data are reviewed in order to consider both methodology and also the clinical relevance of findings with emphasis on trials with ACE-inhibitors like CONSENSUS-II, the ISIS-4, GISSI-3 and Chinese mega-trials, TRACE, SAVE and AIRE. Results of SAVE and AIRE show a clear survival benefit for the patients. Furthermore, the benefit of both trials was in addition to any other benefit which resulted from aspirin, thrombolytic and beta-blocker therapies. In absolute terms, treatment of 1,000 patients with ramipril (AIRE) for 1 year would be expected to result in the prevention/delay of 40 premature deaths. The beneficial effects of ramipril were clearly apparent by 30 days though additional benefit beyond this point was also present. Furthermore, prespecified subgroup analysis revealed significant benefit for patients at risk like women and the elderly. A selective approach is argued for the treatment of patients with ACE-inhibitors after myocardial infarction.", 
    "260": "ACE inhibitors induce an increase in kinin levels with subsequent release of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, as shown in cultured endothelial cells and isolated rat hearts. Isolated perfused working rat hearts continuously release kinins and prostacyclin. During ischemia after ligation of the left coronary artery kinin and prostacyclin concentrations in the venous effluent of the hearts are increased. ACE inhibition with ramiprilat increases kinin concentrations during normoxia, ischemia and reperfusion, whereas deendothelialization markedly reduces kinin and prostacyclin outflow in controls as well as in ACE inhibitor-treated hearts. Rat hearts with postischemic reperfusion arrhythmias are protected by ramiprilat- and bradykinin perfusion, cardiodynamics and metabolism of treated hearts are improved. These effects are observed in concentrations too low to increase coronary flow. The cardioprotective effects of ramiprilat and bradykinin are abolished by the specific B2-kinin receptor antagonist icatibant and by an inhibitor of NO-synthase. Long-term treatment (20 weeks) with ramipril in a blood-pressure-lowering dose (1 mg/kg/day) and a subantihypertensive dose (10 micromg/kg/day) protects spontaneously hypertensive rats (stroke prone) against hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in the high dose. In addition, both treatment regimens induce myocardial capillary growth. Isolated hearts of these animals show increased myocardial contractility and coronary flow, reduced release of cytosolic enzymes into the coronary effluent, and improved myocardial metabolism. These changes are observed even at a dose of ramipril which does not affect blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy. They are abolished by chronic blockade of kinin receptors with icatibant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "261": "In the treatment of patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease using PTCA, success is limited due to restenosis rates ranging from 30-50% of the lesions treated. Medical approaches to reduce the rate of restenosis were therefore tested in a number of trials. However, in only a few randomized and controlled trials were positive effects reported. Inhibiting platelet aggregation through the use of anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa monoclonal antibody 7E3 and, in some studies, with 3 omega fatty acids, a significant reduction in the rate of restenosis was observed. Many trials testing less potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation, such as acetylsalicylic acid, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists, and ticlopidine as well as anticoagulants such as heparin or coumarin, calcium antagonists, ACE-inhibitors, antiproliferative agents such as colchicine, methylprednisolone, and angiopeptin were inconclusive or without a positive treatment effect. The results of a hirudin multicenter trial on the rate of restenosis (Helvetica Trial) will soon be reported. There are many possible reasons for these disappointing results, such as poor standardization of the invasive studies, in analyzing the degree of coronary artery stenoses, the inadequate sample size in many trials, and insufficient local drug concentrations as well as the lack of beneficial effects of the study medication. Thus, at present there is no effective treatment to reduce the restenosis rate following PTCA. However, it can be expected that potent antithrombins, or inhibitors of platelet aggregation, may be useful.", 
    "262": "The metabolic syndrome is characterized by cluster-like occurrence of various risk-factors for vascular disease: overweight, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperproteinuria. In the pathogenesis of this syndrome the peripheral resistance to insulin leading to hyperinsulinemia plays most likely a central role, as the development of individual components of the metabolic syndrome may causally be explained in this way. Various possible explanations exist for the development of insulin resistance: on the receptor level, as a result of changes in the capillary bed or in muscle fiber composition, or resulting from disturbed circulation of muscles. Clinical symptoms of hyperinsulinemia are hypertension, lipodystrophy, and type II diabetes. Patients with metabolic syndrome represent a group at high risk for arteriosclerotic vascular disease. Therapy aims primarily at reduction of hyperinsulinemia as the underlying factor. In particular non-medical intervention plays an important role (reduction of body weight, exercise). In drug therapy of hypertension only such antihypertensives which remain neutral to metabolism should be applied, i.e., ACE-inhibitors which even improve the metabolic condition.", 
    "263": "The goals of rational antihypertensive medication should embrace the alleviation of atherosclerosis, the clinical consequences of which pose a major health problem and hence socio-economic concern for industrialized countries. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are endowed with pharmacodynamic features which may help to attain this aim. Various animal experiments with cholesterol-fed rabbits, pigs and monkeys, as well as with rabbits with inherent disorder of lipid metabolism (WHHL-rabbit), demonstrated endothelial protection against loss of function due to hyperlipidemia and attenuation of lipid deposition in conduit blood vessels with ACE-inhibition. The alleviation of progressive atherosclerosis, which is a common feature of restenosis development following angioplasty, was shown in hypercholesterolemic rabbits and normal rats, but did not occur in clinically more relevant porcine models nor in large clinical trials. Circumstantial evidence from miscellaneous experiments is in line with the view that it is enhancement of bradykinin activity which causes the endothelial protection against the consequences of hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, loss of relaxation of coronary resistance vessels without overt atherosclerosis despite hypercholesterolemia can be restored by augmentation of the EDRF-pathway as has been demonstrated with ramiprilat in vitro. This is being substantiated in preliminary clinical reports with different ACE-inhibitors. The possible association between improvement in both insulin sensitivity and endothelial function requires further investigation. The critical analysis of present experimental findings on a beneficial influence on both the spontaneous and the progressive development of atherosclerosis indicates ACE-inhibition to be more likely to preserve or restore the function of an intact endothelium than to interfere with the complex reaction occurring after injury of an already affected blood vessel.", 
    "264": "The beneficial cardiovascular effects of ACE inhibitors are thought to be based primarily on a reduction in vascular angiotensin II formation. However, since ACE also degrades the potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator bradykinin, it has been proposed that the local accumulation of this peptide in the vascular wall represents an additional mechanism by which ACE inhibitors exert their cardiovascular effects. In this context it has been demonstrated that incubation of cultured endothelial cells with ACE inhibitors leads to an enhanced formation of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2). This effect is believed to be the consequence of an accumulation of endothelium-derived bradykinin in the vicinity of the endothelial cells. Moreover, by virtue of an as yet unidentified mechanism, ACE inhibitors may also enhance the potency of bradykinin at the receptor level and/or activate the B2-kinin receptor following pre-exposure to bradykinin. Both of these effects may enhance or sustain the bradykinin-induced formation of NO and PGI2 by the endothelium. ACE inhibition also leads to the accumulation of angiotensin I which can be metabolized to angiotensin-(1-7) by another endothelial enzyme, the neutral endopeptidase 24.11. Activating an as yet unidentified receptor, angiotensin-(1-7) (but not other known angiotensin peptides) stimulates endothelial NO release in coronary arteries from different species as well as in the isolated perfused rat heart. This effect also seems to involve the release of vasoactive kinins from the endothelium. The shift in angiotensin I metabolism towards an enhanced formation of angiotensin-(1-7) in the presence of an ACE inhibitor may thus also contribute to the hypotensive action of this class of compounds.",

The AT1 receptor expression was enhanced in the neointima at 8 days in the aorta and carotid artery compared to that in intact media. Maintenance of the high expression of AT1 receptors in the neonintimal tissue at 15 and 30 days was localized to a subpopulation of neointimal cell close to the lumen of the vessel and was correlated to the distribution of smooth muscle cells immunoreactive to proliferating cell nuclear antigen. During the initial stages after injury, binding of [125I]351A to angiotensin-converting enzyme was significantly decreased in both the intima/media layers as well as adventitia in carotid artery and aorta. Binding of [125I] 351A to angiotensin-converting enzyme was significantly lower in the neointima compared to that in the intima/media of intact vessels. Our results reveal that the expression of AT1 receptors is heterogeneous in the neointima, and suggest that enhanced expression of AT1 receptors in the balloon catheter-injured carotid artery and aorta may be limited to proliferating intimal smooth muscle cells.", 
    "266": "In order to assess the usefulness of the Discrete Fourier Transform Model (DFT) to evaluate time-course drug effects on hypertensive patients studied with Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) a number of experiments were carried out. A total of 10 mild to moderate hypertensive patients were evaluated under placebo and after 8 weeks of active treatment with Enalapril 20 mg per day using ABPM. Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were registered every 15 minutes during daytime and every 30 minutes at night. Pressure profiles of each patient were initially smoothed by hourly means. DFT was then applied to these profiles. The minimum number of harmonics necessary to generate a statistically significant fitting of the blood pressure profile, were obtained by residuals analysis (run test and analysis of variance of the mean sum of residual squares with each new harmonic incorporated to the model). A profile of the blood pressure differences (treatment-placebo) with the rough data of each patient was smoothed by hourly means. DFT was applied again on these substraction profiles. To estimate peak and trough drug effects for the blood pressure decrease function, maximum, minimum and inflexion points were calculated defining the following parameters: T peak: time from drug administration to maximum pressure decrease; T late response: time from drug administration to the inflexion point following the last minimum previous to the next dose; BP peak: the maximum blood pressure decrease amplitude; and the slope BP peak/T peak. The stability of the individual circadian rhythm was confirmed for both ABPM controls comparing times of maximum and minimum on the DFT smoothed profiles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "267": "The effects on renal function of quinapril, an angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and of nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, were studied in the early stages of diabetes in rats. Wistar rats received one injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes; the hyperglycaemia was then controlled with daily insulin therapy (2-3 units NPH insulin/rat). One week after STZ injection, rats were treated orally with quinapril (0.3 or 3 mg/kg/d) or nifedipine (30 mg/kg/day) for 1 week, after which renal functions were compared with those of untreated diabetic rats or non-diabetic control rats. At the end of these two weeks, diabetic rats had gained less weight and had developed renal hypertrophy and glomerular hyperfiltration (3.21 +/- 0.23 vs 2.36 +/- 0.09 ml/min for non-diabetic rats, mean +/- SEM, P < 0.01). Their urinary albumin excretion was higher, as was the urinary excretion of water, sodium, potassium, urea and glucose. One week treatment with quinapril or nifedipine had no significant effect on the increase in the glomerular filtration rate (respectively 2.97 +/- 0.18 and 2.99 +2- 0.15 ml/min). Quinapril and nifedipine differed with regard to their effects on urinary albumin excretion. Albuminuria was increased by nifedipine but not by quinapril (respectively 0.554 +/- 0.158 and 0.149 +/- 0.046 mg/day/100 g BW, P < 0.05). This difference between the effects of the dihydropyridine and the ACE inhibitor on albuminuria may be linked to different effects on the glomerular functions.",

The mean decrease from baseline in predose (i.e., 24 h postdose) sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was statistically significantly (p < 0.01) greater for all combinations studied compared to placebo, as well as to their respective monotherapy components. Synergistic antihypertensive effects were noted for the 5/12.5 mg CLZ/HCTZ combination therapy. The normalization (SDBP < or = 90 mm Hg) rate of the 5/12.5 mg CLZ/HCTZ combination was essentially additive with respect to the component monotherapies. The tolerability profile of the CLZ/HCTZ combination was similar to its respective components and comparable to placebo. The CLZ/HCTZ group reported low serum potassium (K+) and high serum uric acid less frequently than the HCTZ group. Therefore, the CLZ/HCTZ combination (5 mg/12.5 mg) is an option for hypertensive patients not responding to single drug CLZ therapy.", 
    "269": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent a major therapeutic breakthrough for treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure and various chronic renal diseases. They are effective generally well tolerated and safe for most patients. However, acute renal insufficiency or overt renal failure occurs in some patients with underlying critical renal artery stenosis (RAS), hypertensive nephrosclerosis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic congestive heart failure. Diuretic-induced sodium depletion and underlying chronic renal insufficiency are the major predisposing factors for renal insufficiency in all of these patient populations. Renal insufficiency is usually asymptomatic, nonoliguric, associated with hyperkalemia, and in nearly every case completely reversible after discontinuation of the offending agent. Moreover, it can usually be managed in the outpatient setting by discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor, concomitant diuretic or both. An asymptomatic increase in serum creatinine in patients administered ACE inhibitors should raise the possibility of RAS; however, more common renal diseases should be considered. The decision to pursue testing for RAS should be done on an individual basis; moreover, it is imperative that patient willingness to undergo invasive procedures including angioplasty and/or surgery should be determined prospectively.",

The physiological function of Lp(a) is yet not entirely clear. Lp(a) is established to be an independent factor in the genesis of atherosclerosis however. With occurrence of high Lp(a) Lp(a) plasma levels and other atherogenous risk factors at the same time a potentiation of their effects on genesis of atherosclerosis is observed. Unfortunately the therapeutic possibilities of counteracting the high atherogenicity of Lp(a) are still limited, because LDL apheresis as the only known effective technique today cannot be applied in all cases. In several studies it has been shown, that Lp(a) concentrations can be reduced mainly by long term treatment with lipid-lowering sustained-release bezafibrate, ACE-inhibitor fosinopril, alpha-tocopheryl-nicotinate and N-acetylcysteine. Because of the synergistic effects of atherogenous risk factors patients with high Lp(a) concentrations should avoid additional risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, diet increasing LDL, etc.",

The walking distance of patients with claudication improved in all patients while participating in an exercise program. For both treatment groups this improvement was significant (p < 0.05) compared to baseline, from 264 m at baseline to 313 m with bisoprolol and to 400 m with lisinopril.

    "281": "Loss of renal functional reserve, that is, absence of the glomerular vasodilatory response to amino-acid infusion, has been interpreted as equivalent to glomerular hyperperfusion/hypertension, and therefore proposed as a marker of high risk for progressive glomerular sclerosis. To substantiate the validity of this hypothesis we evaluated the renal response to glycine and the extent of glomerular damage 10-12 weeks after induction of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis with or without superimposed clip hypertension. Untreated rats and rats chronically treated with quinapril, a converting-enzyme inhibitor, were studied. In untreated groups, loss of renal functional reserve was demonstrated since GFR, single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) and plasma flow (SNPF) did not increase during glycine infusion. The absence of renal reserve was associated with glomerular hyperfusion/hypertension, and development of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Quinapril reduced proteinuria and diffuse sclerosis in anti-glomerular basement membrane GN, and decreased blood pressure and segmental glomerulosclerosis in antiglomerular basement membrane GN with superimposed clip hypertension. Both treated groups demonstrated a restoration of renal functional reserve, as depicted by increases in GFR, SNGFR, and SNPF after glycine, despite persistence of glomerular hyperperfusion/hypertension. These data demonstrate that renal functional reserve testing, although it does not detect glomerular hyperperfusion/hypertension, can provide information on the progression of glomerular damage.",

Here are described: a) the basic investigations that allow to diagnose both the underlying conditions and the mechanisms of ARF in adults; b) an etiologic classification of ARF. Elements of the renal syndrome, composed of anamnestic, clinical, laboratory, imaging and, if necessary, histological data, have to be gathered in each individual case. Emphasis is laid on some forms of ARF of increasing frequency: ARF induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritides, necrotizing vasculitides with circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Early diagnosis of spontaneously non-reversible parenchymal lesions leads to timely etiopathogenic therapy and increases the likelihood of renal anatomical and functional recovery.", 
    "283": "Arterial hypertension is a well known risk factor for atherosclerosis and its complications. Lowering of blood pressure significantly reduces the incidence of cerebrovascular events and to a minor extent that of ischemic heart disease. Interference of antihypertensive drugs on lipoproteins, glucose and electrolytes metabolism has been suggested as a hypothesis for the lower than expected protection against cardiac events. The new antihypertensive agents such as calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and post-synaptic alpha-1 receptor antagonists have proved to be neutral or to have positive effect on metabolic disturbances. Urapidil, a multifactorial antihypertensive agent, has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure and to have a favorable impact on the metabolic profile in adult and elderly hypertensive patients and in patients with diabetes mellitus and elevated blood pressure. Although arterial hypertension is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, the clinical events at the cerebral and coronary levels are secondary to thrombo-embolic complications. On the other hand it has been shown that abnormalities in coagulation factor has a prognostic value. Therefore, new and old antihypertensive agents should be investigated not only for their effects on hypertension, metabolic profile and quality of life but also on coagulation, in order to improve the therapeutic profile.",

The three studies were the American Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension) and the British Medical Research Council Trial of Treatment of Hypertension in Older Adults. (MRC trial.) The three trials all compared active antihypertensive treatment, mainly consisting of diuretics or beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents or the two in combination, with placebo. Two of the trials were double-blind (SHEP and STOP) whereas the MRC trial was single-blind. All three were multicenter and prospective, and patients were randomized to either of the treatment modalities. One of the trials (SHEP) was specifically designed to evaluate antihypertensive treatment in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The SHEP, STOP and MRC trials all showed that treatment of hypertension in the elderly reduces the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events. In the STOP-Hypertension trial, which included the oldest patients with the most severe hypertension, total mortality was reduced by 43%. It could be argued that novel antihypertensive compounds offer equal or better results than the ones obtained with beta blockers and/or diuretics.

This study included 40 patients with mild or moderate hypertension: 30 patients (19 male--63.3% and 11 female--36.7%), their mean age 40.1 year, who were treated with Kaptopril (Zorkaptil), and 10 patients (6 female--60% and 4 male--40%), their mean age 37.7 years, who received placebo. Before the beginning of the treatment and three months later the following data were analyzed: blood pressure, the left ventricular mass, the left ventricular mass index, shortening fraction, ejection fraction and the endsystolic left wall stress. Three months later in the group treated with Kaptopril significant reduction of blood pressure, left ventricular mass, left ventricular mass index and endsystolic left wall stress (p < 0.05) was found. The changes concerning ejection fraction and shortening fraction were not significant. Three months later, in the group which received placebo no changes could be found. It can be concluded that Kaptopril is an effective antihypertensive drug for treating some cases of mild and moderate hypertension as monotherapy not only because it control the blood pressure, but also because it significantly reduces the wall thickness of the left ventricular mass and of the endsystolic left wall stress.",

    "290": "To determine whether angiotensine converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) therapy should be continued up to the time of the surgical procedure, a standard practice for other modern antihypertensive agents, it should be known whether stopping the treatment does or does not lead to a hypertensive episode before surgery or at intubation and whether continuing treatment is or is not associated with an unacceptable fall in blood pressure at induction. Data from the literature obtained in patients chronically treated for essential hypertension with captopril or enalapril demonstrate that withdrawal of ACEI therapy before surgery does not result in a higher incidence of hypertensive episodes both preoperatively and at intubation. In contrast, an increased need for ephedrine to maintain blood pressure at induction is observed in patients who receive ACEI together with their premedication. This exaggerated hypotensive response to induction is in agreement with previous studies in anaesthetized subjects which have shown that angiotensin II contributes to hemodynamic regulation during general and epidural anaesthesia. It might also be the consequence of the specific effects of ACEI therapy on the loading conditions of the heart and/or the autonomic nervous system. It must be emphasized that both ACEIs and epidural anaesthesia dilate large arteries as capacitance vessels and increase vagal tone. The decreased tone in capacitance vessels accentuates the drops in blood pressure provoked by general or epidural anaesthesia through an increase in blood pooling at the expense of cardiac filling. This mechanism is enhanced by the presence of either a preoperative hypovolemia or a disturbed left ventricular diastolic function, which are two abnormalities frequently seen in hypertensive vascular surgical patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "291": "The primary aim of the management of hypertension should be to prevent coronary heart disease. Antihypertensive treatment should have a beneficial effect on the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease, particularly hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and/or glucose intolerance. Other important risk factors include central obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalemia, and smoking. In patients genetically predisposed to essential hypertension, metabolic alterations characterized by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia tend to occur already before the development of hypertension, obesity, or redistribution of body fat. In the treatment of normotensive or borderline hypertensive diabetic patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have shown superiority to other agents due to their antiproteinuric effect and their beneficial influence on the glomerular filtration rate. ACE inhibitor treatment of patients with overt diabetic nephropathy has been reported to reduce the risk of mortality and the need for dialysis or transplantation. Beta blockers and thiazide diuretics are still the 'gold standard' of antihypertensive therapy in non-diabetic patients, as they offer at least some prognostic benefit, while the influence of the newer antihypertensive drugs on morbidity and mortality in these patients is not yet known. Nevertheless, since practicing physicians have to treat patients rather than statistical numbers, the current trend towards a more individualized selection, including the newer antihypertensive drugs with consideration of their metabolic, cardiac, and renal action profile, is also difficult to rebut. ACE inhibitors and most calcium antagonists have already evolved as the preferred drugs for the treatment of hypertension in diabetics due to their favorable effects on some of the cardiovascular and renal risk factors.", 
    "292": "The timing of treatment for any condition is dependent on the underlying pathophysiology. One of the issues to consider is whether decreasing the time to intervention can be translated into recognisable benefits. Key data have been generated over the last 10 years which are relevant to the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI), including results of the large-scale 'mega-trials' in broad population groups. The therapeutic interventions which will be considered here are beta blockers, aspirin, thrombolytics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Of these, aspirin seems to be the least time-dependent, provided it is administered within 12-24 h of symptom onset. Mortality benefits associated with beta blocker therapy increase as the time of administration from symptom onset is reduced and the extent to which thrombolytic therapy is beneficial is also clearly time dependent. The results from GISSI-3 and ISIS-4, which recruited a broader patient population than in previous trials, were concordant, showing a significant improvement in survival after five to six weeks' treatment. The message from GISSI-3 was that administration of ACE inhibitors within 24 h of symptom onset will improve survival and left ventricular function provided patients are hemodynamically stable, are not hypotensive and have no renal dysfunction; 76 lives were saved (representing an 11% risk reduction in mortality) after six weeks' lisinopril treatment, 54 of which were saved in the first five days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Progressive renal failure occurs in heterozygous male animals. The mechanisms of progression have not been elucidated. To identify some pathogenetic factors involved we subjected male SPRD Pkd rats (and their non-affected littermates as controls) to uninephrectomy (UNX), castration or enalapril treatment. To assess progression S-urea at age 150 days was chosen as endpoint. (i) In uninephrectomized male Han: SPRD Pkd (n = 12 animals per group) S-urea at age 150 days was consistently above 300 mg/dl, while it was 245 mg/dl (191-290) in control Han: SPRD Pkd. (ii) In castrated male Han: SPRD median S urea at 150 days was 100 mg/dl (69-211) compared to sham-operated male Han: SPRD controls (245; 191-290). Castration did not, however, prevent accelerated progression after uninephrectomy. (iii) Enalapril (50 mg/l) in the drinking fluid did not significantly lower median systolic blood pressure (by plethysmography) in animals on 0.2% sodium diet (at 185 days 160 mmHg; 140-170 versus 170; 140-195 in non-enalapril controls), although circulating ACE was significantly inhibited (17 U; 11-33 versus 89; 52-108 in controls). S-urea at age 185 days was not significantly different in the 2 groups. In conclusion, the Han: SPRD Pkd model differs from human ADPKD to some extent. Uninephrectomy accelerates renal failure in the rat, but not in humans. On the other hand, in contrast to human ADPKD the renin system is suppressed in the rat model and ACE inhibition does not affect the course of renal failure.", 
    "294": "Objectives of this study were to determine if aerosolized bradykinin causes bronchoconstriction in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated rats, and if pretreatment with enalaprilat, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), or phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.11 (EP 24.11), alters the response. We found that aerosolized bradykinin elicited a reproducible bronchoconstrictor response that was significantly amplified by pretreatment with aerosolized enalaprilat or phosphoramidon. Neither inhibitor alone affected airway tone or caused nonspecific airway hyperreactivity. These findings indicate that both ACE and EP 24.11 contribute to bradykinin degradation in rat airways.",

Capillary blood cell velocity was 0.6 +/- 0.4 mm/s at baseline and increased to 0.6 +/- 0.4 mm/s. There were no significant changes in morphological capillaroscopic and echocardiographic parameters. In conclusion, we observed a trend toward higher capillary blood cell velocity as early as after 6 weeks of treatment with cilazapril plus hydrochlorothiazide in mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "299": "To assess the effectiveness of cilazapril in regulating blood pressure (BP) in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders, 23 male patients (mean age, 50 years; mean body mass index, 32.7 kg/m2) with a mean apnea/hypopnea index of 49.7 and arterial hypertension (163/104 mm Hg) participated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study. They received either cilazapril, 2.5 mg/day (n = 12) or placebo (n = 11). The effects of treatment were studied under different conditions of sleep and physical and mental load before and after 8 days of treatment. Measurements by night included cardiorespiratory polysomnography, inductive plethysmography, pulse oximetry and nasal air flow, electroencephalography, (EEG), electrooculography and electromyography, (ECG), and blood pressure (BP). Measurements by day (ECG, heart rate, and BP) were performed at rest and under physical and mental load. Systolic, diastolic, and mean BP (5 min at night; 1 s during the day), heart rate, apnea and hypopnea index, EEG data, and test reaction times were compared in both groups. The systolic and diastolic BP of patients receiving cilazapril was lower compared to baseline for all physical and mental loads. Mean BP reductions over all standardized loads was greater with cilazapril than placebo (-10 vs. -4.3 mm Hg, p < 0.05). These results show that BP is influenced similarly by mental and physical loads, and that behavior [i.e., awake state and non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement (NREM and REM) sleep determines BP regulation. Cilazapril is effective in reducing BP in all situations, especially during REM sleep hypertension.", 
    "300": "To evaluate its antihypertensive efficacy and safety in elderly hypertensive patients, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril was compared to the calcium antagonist nitrendipine in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial with 114 subjects (mean age, 68 years; diastolic blood pressure, 90-115 mm Hg; systolic blood pressure, 140-220 mm Hg). After a 1-month placebo washout period, patients received either cilazapril, 2.5-5 mg, or nitrendipine, 10-20 mg, once daily for 12 weeks. After 4 weeks, the dose was doubled in non-responders. The higher dosage level was administered to 42% of patients in the cilazapril-treated group and to 47% in the nitrendipine-treated group. Blood pressure was measured before (at 60 min and 30 min, and just prior to administration) and at 60, 90, and 120 min after drug administration. Both cilazapril and nitrendipine significantly (p < 0.01) reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The decrease in systolic blood pressure measured at trough was significantly greater with cilazapril than with nitrendipine (-17 vs. -12 mm Hg, p < 0.05), but the effect of the two drugs on diastolic blood pressure was similar (-11 mm Hg). Tolerability was assessed by means of adverse events, laboratory assessments, psychometric tests, and questionnaires on mood states and sleep. Adverse events were reported by 9% of patients in the cilazapril group and by 21% of patients in the nitrendipine group (p < 0.05). Laboratory test results and profiles for mood, sleep, memory, and attention were not affected by either treatment. Thus, cilazapril and nitrendipine both appear to be effective and well tolerated antihypertensive agents in the elderly patient.", 
    "301": "Peripheral vascular resistance, arterial blood pressure, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are closely related. In systemic hypertension, hemodynamic changes in systolic and diastolic function accompany LVH. Both of these cardiac functions are detected with echocardiography and were measured during this study in 23 essential hypertension patients treated with 2.5-5 mg of cilazapril daily for 6 months. Reduction in left ventricular mass was accompanied by an improvement in early diastolic filling pattern. This change in cardiac performance with cilazapril vasodilator monotherapy was characterized by a significant improvement in isovolumic relaxation time and normalized left ventricular early/atrial filling ratio.", 
    "302": "This article focuses on the links between insulin and blood pressure at the level of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The effects of insulin on plasma potassium levels and whole-body potassium content and the effect of potassium on glucose-induced insulin release identify a physiological glucose-potassium cycle. The normal interactions of insulin and hyperglycemia with the hormones of the RAAS are reviewed, and their changes in patients with diabetes mellitus are discussed. Some key findings on the interrelationships of insulin and the RAAS with regard to sodium metabolism are also brought into focus. A role for changes in the RAAS secondary to insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia is delineated in relation to the excess hypertension of diabetes. The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance are reviewed in the context of the glucose-potassium cycle.", 
    "303": "Resistance arteries may play a critical role in hypertension, and correcting their structural abnormalities may improve the clinical outcome of hypertensive patients. There have been several studies of the effects of antihypertensive treatment on the structure of resistance vessels in hypertension. These studies have yielded inconclusive results regarding the ability of individual drugs to induce regression of the changes occurring in blood vessels in hypertension, both in experimental models and in humans. This article reviews the results of studies of antihypertensive treatment on resistance vessel structure and function, and in particular those of a recent study in which the effects of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-blocker atenolol on the structure and function of subcutaneous resistance arteries were evaluated in a double-blind randomized trial in patients with mild essential hypertension. In this study, patients were randomly assigned to receive either cilazapril or atenolol, and blood pressure was effectively controlled for 1 year. Treatment for 1 year with cilazapril resulted in a significant reduction in the media-to-lumen ratio of resistance arteries dissected from subcutaneous gluteal fat biopsy samples, although the ratio was still slightly but significantly larger than that of resistance arteries of normotensive controls. In arteries from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change in media-to-lumen ratio with treatment. Contractile responses to several vasoconstrictors, particularly endothelin-1, which were blunted in hypertensive patients, were normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients, but were unchanged in those taking atenolol. These results suggest that in humans it is possible to correct in part the vascular remodeling present in hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "304": "Traditionally, the diagnosis of significant coronary atherosclerotic disease has relied on angiographic techniques. Both histologic analyses and, more recently, intravascular ultrasonography techniques have revealed that a significant atherosclerotic plaque load may be present in epicardial coronary arteries without significant luminal narrowing, consistent with compensatory vessel enlargement or remodeling. In patients with coronary atherosclerosis, more limited structural changes are present in the smaller resistance arterioles, whereas a decrease in luminal area with an increase in wall thickness and perivascular fibrosis are the characteristic structural changes observed in resistance arteries in the presence of systemic hypertension. Further, functional changes, such as impairment of endothelium-mediated vasodilation, are present in epicardial and resistance vessels of patients with coronary atherosclerosis and may influence the progression of this disease and development of ischemic syndromes. The introduction of two-dimensional intravascular and Doppler ultrasonography enables us to study in vivo these morphologic and functional changes. In this article, the knowledge acquired in humans on the mechanisms and clinical relevance of vascular remodeling with the use of these two ultrasonography-based techniques is reviewed. The possibility of using pharmacologic interventions to improve or normalize the vascular response to endothelium-dependent and independent vascular interventions is discussed, with special attention to the efficacy of the inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme.", 
    "305": "To investigate the short-term effects of cilazapril on left ventricular diastolic functions in patients with essential hypertension, 20 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were evaluated. Following 2 weeks of placebo washout, all patients underwent blood pressure determination and echo-Doppler ultrasonography recordings. Cilazapril, 2.5 mg, was given to all patients, and blood pressure was determined. Echo Doppler ultrasonography recordings were repeated 3 h after drug therapy. The investigated diastolic function parameters were peak and mean velocities of mitral E and A waves, ratio of peak E to peak A, and acceleration and deceleration rates of E and A waves. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes were insignificant. The E wave peak and mean velocities were significantly increased (p = 0.006 and 0.02, respectively), and the A wave peak and mean velocities were significantly reduced (p = 0.006 and 0.02, respectively) after cilazapril therapy. The ratio of peak E to peak A velocity was also found to be increased following cilazapril therapy (p = 0.006). It is to be concluded that the immediate improvement of left ventricular diastolic functions after cilazapril therapy despite the lack of blood pressure decrease is probably a result of the inhibition of tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme and/or other local humoral factors, but this needs to be further investigated.", 
    "306": "The efficacy and safety of cilazapril in chronic heart failure have been extensively investigated in an international clinical program in patients with underlying chronic heart failure with ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy. Cilazapril in single doses of 1.25-5 mg produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance and a significant increase in cardiac index. In placebo-controlled studies, 1-5 mg of cilazapril once daily for 12 weeks prolonged predose exercise test duration and improved New York Heart Association classification status and signs and symptoms of chronic heart failure, including paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Up to 86% of patients receiving these dosages had improvement, with only 12% of patients requiring the higher dose, 5 mg. These data indicate that cilazapril is effective when administered once daily to patients with chronic heart failure receiving concomitant therapy with digitalis and/or a diuretic. The safety of cilazapril in patients with chronic heart failure has been evaluated in 1,163 patients administered from 0.5 to 15 mg once daily for treatment periods ranging from 1 day to 57 months. Cilazapril was administered to 500 patients for at least 6 months, 264 patients for at least 1 year, and 101 patients for at least 2 years. The most frequently occurring adverse events were dizziness, coughing, dyspnea, fatigue, angina pectoris, and headache. Cilazapril was equally well tolerated by young and elderly patients. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in 12.9% of patients, mainly as a result of coughing (1.7%) and dizziness (1%). Forty-four patients (3.8%) died during cilazapril therapy or during a period without treatment. Of these deaths, 93% were due to cardiac causes, especially rhythm disturbances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "307": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality; in the United States alone, CHF afflicts 4 million patients, representing about 2% of the adult population; causes or contributes to more than 250,000 deaths yearly; and is the principal or secondary diagnosis in 6% of all hospital discharges. After the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as potent antihypertensive agents, an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of CHF, in addition to the recognition of heart failure as a process that evolves through time, led to the use of these agents in patients with CHF. Subsequently, a series of multicenter trials systematically explored the role of ACE-inhibitor therapy in heart failure. The purpose of this review is to discuss some of these trials and to describe the answers that they provide to the following questions: Are vasodilators beneficial in the treatment of severe heart failure? Are ACE inhibitors beneficial in mild-to-moderate heart failure? Which vasodilator regimen (ACE inhibitors or hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate) is more effective? Finally, are ACE inhibitors beneficial in asymptomatic patients at risk of heart failure?", 
    "308": "The left ventricle can change its size and shape as a result of external load and/or loss of viable myocytes. This process, defined as remodeling, can be adaptive, as in compensatory hypertrophy and dilation secondary to myocardial infarction, or maladaptive in response to long-standing systemic hypertension. In addition to ventricular enlargement and cellular hypertrophy, extensive interstitial collagen deposition also occurs during this remodeling process. The increased fibrous tissue and hypertrophied myocytes can also lead to inappropriate energy production and utilization. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have the ability to modulate both cellular hypertrophy and collagen deposition. These effects represent, in part, the mechanism by which ACE inhibitors modify ventricular remodeling, the subsequent development and clinical expression of heart failure, and finally, the improvement in the mortality of patients with heart failure.", 
    "309": "A study was performed on renin synthesis in order to evaluate changes that occur in renal cells during angiotensin-converting enzyme chronic inhibition of Ang I in mice. Immediately after weaning, 20 CF1 mice received 20 mg/l enalapril maleate in drinking water during 16 months; this group was compared with a control group. Kidney tissue was processed and studies using optical and electron microscope immunochemical techniques were performed. An antirenin antibody was used, and in situ hybridization was performed to keep track of renin mRNA with a digoxygenin-marked probe. We calculated the number of juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), afferent arterioles (AA) and arcuate vessels (AV) immunomarked (IM) with antirenin and antidigoxygenin. These parameters were rendered in JGA rates (%IMJGA) and AA (%IMAA) and AV (%IMAV) marked rates (%AV), and in the rate of JGA (%SJGA), AA (%SAA) and AV (%SAV) hybridization signs. Electron microscope readings were used to determine the number of gold particles per renin granule. An increase in the number of renin-producing cells was observed in animals having received enalapril chronically, beyond AJG and AA, since marking was observed in arcuate vessels. The mean %MJGA value was lower in control animals (65.6% +/- 2.4) than in treated animals (94.2% +/- 3 p < 0.05). Similar findings occurred with %MAA: 23.6% +/- 3, (control animals) vs. 41.6% +/- 2.3, p < 0.05 (treated animals). AV were not marked in the control group, as they were in treated animals where %MAV was 4.4% +/- 1.6. The mRNA distribution was different in animals with RAS inhibition as compared with control animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "310": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertension is initially a useful compensatory process, but it can also represent the first step toward a pathologic process that leads to the development of congestive heart failure. In fact, epidemiologic studies have documented that LVH in essential hypertension represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Reversing or even preventing LVH, through a reduction of elevated blood pressure values and modification of some other pathogenetic factors, should represent a major therapeutic goal for the treatment of hypertensive patients. It has been demonstrated that different classes of antihypertensive drugs do not have the same effect in reducing left ventricular mass, probably because, beyond the control of blood pressure, their pharmacologic interference with the adrenergic system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or other growth factors can influence the development and the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy. Two recent meta-analyses of the principal regression studies have indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists, followed by drugs capable of reducing sympathetic nervous system activity, are most effective in decreasing LV mass. The results of experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that the reversal of cardiac hypertrophy is associated with an improvement of the functional consequences of increased LV mass. Further studies are needed to verify whether the reversal of LVH per se increases survival rate in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "311": "Regression of cardiovascular structural changes is a main goal of antihypertensive treatment. Two recent meta-analyses of relatively small noncomparative studies have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be more effective than other classes of drugs in inducing regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The effect of different antihypertensive drugs on arteriolar structural changes has not yet been properly investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 6 months of treatment with amlodipine (5-10 mg o.d.) or enalapril (10-20 mg o.d.) on blood pressure (BP) (ambulatory monitoring), heart rate (HR), LV mass and function (M-mode echo, two-dimensionally guided), forearm minimal vascular resistance (min VR = BP/max blood flow-venous occlusion plethysmography, taken as an index of vascular structural changes) in 24 hypertensive patients in a comparative single-blind, randomized study, with blind reading of echocardiograms and plethysmographic tracings. After 6 months of treatment with amlodipine 5-10 mg o.d., significant reductions in LV mass index (p = 0.004) and forearm min VR (p = 0.02) were observed. Before and during treatment, LV systolic function, both at rest and during stress (handgrip test), evaluated by fractional shortening as related to end-systolic stress, was in every case within 95% confidence limits calculated in normal subjects. Similar results were observed with enalapril. No significant differences were observed for Doppler indices of diastolic filling after 6 months of treatment with either drug. These results indicate that a significant regression of structural changes in the heart and in the small resistance vessels can be observed after long-term treatment with amlodipine in essential hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "312": "During the past decade, attention has focused on the effects of calcium antagonists on renal function. Recent studies using diverse video microscopic techniques, including the isolated perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney model, which permits direct visualization of afferent and efferent arterioles, have demonstrated that calcium antagonists acutely antagonize pre-glomerular vasoconstriction. In contrast, most studies suggest that the efferent arteriole appears to be refractory to the vasodilatory effects of these agents. Although the clinical implications of such observations have not been fully delineated, the results of recent studies indicate that calcium antagonists exert salutary effects on renal function in clinical settings characterized by impaired renal hemodynamics, including transplant-associated acute renal insufficiency and possibly cyclosporin nephrotoxicity. Evidence has accrued suggesting that calcium antagonists may also be protective against acute radiocontrast-induced nephrotoxicity. The renal hemodynamic and natriuretic effects of calcium antagonists command their use as antihypertensive agents in the management of essential hypertension, and transplant-associated hypertension.", 
    "313": "We compared angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and carboxypeptidase A (CPA), two zinc metallopeptidases, for the hydrolysis of the usual ACE synthetic substrate benzoylglycyl-histidyl-leucine (HHL) investigating the possible interference by CPA in the determination of ACE activity in biological fluids. Both purified enzymes hydrolyse HHL in a radiochemical assay with the same optimal pH, a characteristic divalent metal requirement, a close similar behavior against inhibitors of other metallopeptidases, such as enkephalinase and kininase I, and the involvement of arginine and lysine residues in their active site. Conversely, CPA does not show the other catalytic properties of ACe, i.e. chloride dependence, low Km for HHL, inhibition by specific synthetic ACE inhibitors and antibody, also hydrolysis of the other ACE substrate furylacryloylphenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine (FAPGG). We advise the use of ACE inhibitors to validate ACE measurement with HHL or, alternatively, FAPGG, which is a more specific substrate for ACE, must be preferred, although the poor sensitivity of the spectrophotometric assay with this substrate limits its use to blood samples.", 
    "314": "Endothelial cells modulate the tone of the underlying smooth muscle by generating endothelium-derived relaxing and constricting factors. Captopril (CPT), unlike other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, contains a sulfhydryl (-SH) group and can act as a free radical scavenger. Iloprost (ILO) is a synthetic analogue of prostacyclin and mimics the effects of this compound. This study was designed to investigate the effect of ILO and CPT on the mechanism of endothelin (ET) release after mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in the rat. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: sham-operated, control, ILO (25 micrograms/kg), CPT (10 micrograms/kg), and ILO + CPT. The superior mesenteric artery was occluded for 30 min and then allowed 90 min of reperfusion, except in the sham-operated group, and the corresponding agents were given to the treated groups prior to I/R injury. After I/R injury, portal venous blood was obtained for ET assay, and ileal tissue samples were also obtained for the determination of malondialdehyde (MDA), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and for histopathological examination. MDA levels were significantly lower in the CPT, ILO and, ILO + CPT groups than in the control group, indicating the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in all groups. ET levels increased in the control group, and this increase was reversed with ILO. In the CPT group, ET levels were significantly increased, and the addition of ILO did not affect this increase. Significant cytopreservative effect was achieved with ILO and CPT, the latter being more prominent histopathologically. CPT exerts a significant protective effect on the intestinal mucosa after I/R injury. This protection is accomplished by increased ET levels and seems to be unrelated to its inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation and also unrelated to the arachidonic acid cascade.", 
    "315": "Although essential hypertension is usually defined as a hemodynamic disorder, it is expressed differently among individuals and varies during progression of the disease state. Therefore, various types of treatment can be envisioned. The use of selective I1-imidazoline-receptor agonists to modulate I1-imidazoline receptors involved in the central regulation of blood pressure has led to the introduction of a novel class of centrally acting antihypertensive drugs. Moxonidine, a representative molecule of this class, dissociates between a 10% alpha 2-adrenoceptor-agonist action linked with side effects such as fatigue or dry mouth, and a 90% specific antihypertensive action resulting from its selective agonistic action at I1-imidazoline receptors. Clinical experience is based on more than 2,000 patients and volunteers, and long-term efficacy has been demonstrated in about 500 patients who received a daily dose of moxonidine 0.2-0.4 mg. Moxonidine produces a pronounced reduction in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex tachycardia, accompanied by reduced plasma norepinephrine concentration and plasma-renin activity. Cardiovascular responses to exercise and standing remain nearly normal, and serious or life-threatening side effects, particularly the sympathetic overactivity that can occur on sudden withdrawal of other centrally acting agents, are never observed. In addition, moxonidine behaves neutrally with respect to plasma levels of cholesterol, potassium and glucose, glucose and lipid metabolism, and renal function, and can be administered without complication to patients with asthma or certain other diseases. Studies with magnetic resonance imaging have shown that moxonidine significantly reduces left ventricular mass, an indicator of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), within a 6-month treatment period, an effect that coincided with decreased plasma concentrations of catecholamines and renin. Comparisons between moxonidine and other well-established antihypertensive drugs such as nifedipine, atenolol, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors showed equal effectiveness in lowering blood pressure, whereas the adverse events profile always favored moxonidine. Considering its efficacy, safety, and specific effects (e.g., its ability to reduce LVH), moxonidine meets the criteria satisfied by other currently prescribed antihypertensive drugs. Because of its especially favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, moxonidine should be recommended as first-line treatment of hypertension and may also be useful in treating related problems such as LVH, coronary artery disease, and ventricular premature beats.", 
    "316": "In 26 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, 80.8% of whom had a history of concomitant diseases, the effect of moxonidine (0.2 mg b.i.d.) on the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure profile (ABPM) was compared with captopril (25 mg b.i.d.) in a double-blind, parallel-group study. After 4 weeks of treatment with placebo, ABPM was performed and the patients were treated with moxonidine (n = 14) or captopril (n = 12) for a further 4 weeks. ABPM was then repeated. Both moxonidine and captopril reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure sufficiently and to the same extent. Mean 24-h pulse rate and standard laboratory parameters were not changed by active treatment. After drug withdrawal for 5 days, sitting blood pressure did not differ from baseline values in both groups. Serious adverse events did not occur, the most frequent complaints were nausea (2 of 14 patients receiving moxonidine) and dizziness (3 of 12 patients receiving captopril). We concluded that the blood pressure-lowering effects of moxonidine (0.2 mg b.i.d.) and captopril (25 mg b.i.d.) are comparable in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "317": "An international trial recruited 1,049 patients from 122 investigators. After a 2- to 4-week, single-blind placebo run-in, patients were treated unblinded for 1 year. Therapy was started with trandolapril 2 mg once daily. The dose was increased to 4 mg/day if, after 1 month, blood pressure was not normalized, and then was combined with diuretics and/or calcium antagonists in increasing doses if necessary. At the cutoff point for this interim analysis. 481 patients had been treated for over 12 months and 960 for 3 months. At end point, trandolapril produced a significant decrease in blood pressure (-14 mm Hg for mean supine diastolic blood pressure). Blood pressure was normalized in 60% of the population with monotherapy. Trandolapril, alone or in combination with diuretics or calcium antagonists, was well tolerated clinically and biochemically. Only 3.9% patients reported dry cough. Withdrawals of patients from the study for treatment related reasons were 3.8%. Trandolapril had also an excellent antihypertensive effect and was well tolerated in elderly patients, in patients with glucose intolerance, and in patients with renal dysfunction.", 
    "318": "After a single-blind, 4-week placebo run-in period, 161 patients were randomized to trandolapril 2 mg once daily (n = 54), nifedipine slow-release (SR) 20 mg twice daily (n = 55), or a combination of both drugs (n = 52) for 16 weeks. Morning predosing supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the primary efficacy measurement. After 16 weeks the intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in supine DBP (mean +/- SEM) between trandolapril (-12.4 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) and nifedipine SR (-15.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg; p = 0.1). However, the combination therapy was more effective (-18.9 +/- 1.3 mm Hg). Normalized blood pressure at 16 weeks was seen with 54% on trandolapril, 63% on nifedipine SR, and 77% on the combination. Adverse events, possibly related to drug, were more common with nifedipine SR (34%) than with trandolapril (17%; p < 0.05), and in comparison with the combination (21%). Drug-related treatment emergent events, reported by more than 3% of patients (fatigue, palpitations, edema, migraine), were seen only in the nifedipine SR and combination groups. Trandolapril 2 mg proved a well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive agent, comparable to nifedipine SR 40 mg. Furthermore, the combination of the two drugs was shown to enhance the antihypertensive effect of the two compounds alone. Adverse events were less common with trandolapril and the combination than with nifedipine SR alone.", 
    "319": "This multicenter international trial recruited 205 patients from 16 investigators. After a 4-week, single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomized to receive 16 weeks of trandolapril 2 mg/day (68 patients), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg/day (68 patients), or the combination (69 patients). Morning predosing supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the primary efficacy measurement. Intention-to-treat analysis showed significant decreases in all three groups in mean (+/- SEM) supine DBP throughout the study, with no significant differences at week 16 between trandolapril (-10.6 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) and HCTZ (-10.9 +/- 1.3 mm Hg). The combination gave a significantly greater reduction than either drug alone (-15.1 +/- 1.13 mm Hg). Blood pressure was normalized in the combination group in 67% of patients, a significantly higher proportion than either trandolapril (63%) or HCTZ (60%; p = 0.04). Each treatment was well tolerated. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all three groups. Trandolapril 2 mg once daily is an effective antihypertensive agent, comparable to HCTZ. Furthermore, the combination of the two drugs was shown to enhance the antihypertensive effect of the two compounds alone.",

After a 4-week, single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomized double-blind to 16 weeks of trandolapril 4 mg o.d. or captopril 50 mg b.i.d. If blood pressure was not normalized at 8 weeks, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg was added. Morning predosing supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the primary efficacy measurement. At 8 weeks, the intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant difference for supine DBP (mean +/- SEM) between the two groups: trandolapril -13.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg; captopril -10.1 +/- 1.0 mm Hg (p = 0.007). The proportion of patients whose blood pressure was normalized was 61% for trandolapril and 44% for captopril (p = 0.02). At 8 weeks, 26% of the trandolapril group received HCTZ compared with 38% taking captopril. The addition of HCTZ further increased the antihypertensive effect in patients who had shown only moderate reductions in blood pressure after drug monotherapy. Both treatments were well tolerated clinically and biochemically. Withdrawals owing to adverse events were three from trandolapril and eight from the captopril group. Trandolapril given once daily is an effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive agent that, in this study, exhibited better efficacy compared with captopril. When blood pressure is not sufficiently controlled with monotherapy, the combination of trandolapril and HCTZ enhances the antihypertensive effect.", 
    "321": "The effects of trandolapril on 24-h blood pressure in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients of both sexes were investigated by conventional (clinic) and ambulatory recording in a double-blind study at two dosages, 1 mg (n = 14) and 2 mg (n = 13) once daily for 2 weeks. Both methods of measurement showed significant end-of-treatment decreases (p < 0.01 in all cases) in diastolic and systolic pressure in the 1- and 2-mg groups. Although intergroup differences were not significant, inspection of the mean changes from baseline in the eight 3-h periods constituting the 24-h profile showed that reductions were consistently greater in the 2-mg than in the 1-mg group, by 2 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure and 6 mm Hg systolic blood pressure. Values in the last segment of the placebo washout (46-48 h after the last active dose) showed that these reductions were well maintained, notably in the 2-mg group, with a minimal tendency to drift toward pretreatment levels. No effect was observed on the normal circadian blood pressure rhythm. Both doses were well tolerated. In conclusion, trandolapril is an effective, well-tolerated antihypertensive agent for once-daily dosing at either 1 or 2 mg.",

After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in phase, patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to four parallel groups that received either placebo or 0.5, 1, or 2 mg trandolapril for 4 weeks. Treatment was administered as a once-daily dose in the morning and blood pressure was measured 24 h after drug intake. The primary criterion of efficacy was a decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure. At the end of the study, the lowest dose of trandolapril that consistently produced a significant difference from placebo in reducing blood pressure was 1 mg (-6.6 mm Hg for supine diastolic blood pressure). It was effective from around 2 weeks onward; the 2-mg dose differed significantly from placebo from around 1 week onward. At the end of the study, the 1- and 2-mg doses were equally effective. The lowest dose tested, 0.5 mg, showed some evidence of an effect on systolic blood pressure and may well prove to be a useful dose in patients who are highly sensitive to the effect of ACE inhibition. Tolerance throughout the study was good for all doses tested.", 
    "323": "In canine coronary arteries, bradykinin evokes endothelium-dependent relaxations that are mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). The converting-enzyme inhibitor trandolaprilat potentiates the endothelium-dependent relaxations evoked by bradykinin in this tissue. The present experiments were designed to determine whether or not facilitated release of EDHF contributes to the augmented response to bradykinin in the presence of trandolaprilat. Organ-chamber studies were performed to measure changes in isometric tension in rings of canine coronary arteries. In the presence of nitro-L-arginine, an inhibitor of NO synthase, trandolaprilat augmented the endothelium-dependent relaxations evoked by bradykinin. These relaxations were not inhibited by the K(+)-channel inhibitors tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine, or glibenclamide, but were abolished in high-potassium solution. The membrane potential in individual smooth-muscle cells of coronary artery was measured by means of glass microelectrodes. Trandolaprilat potentiated the endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations evoked by a subthreshold concentration of bradykinin, and these endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations were inhibited by high-potassium solution. These experiments demonstrate that EDHF contributes to the relaxation evoked by bradykinin in the canine coronary artery and that trandolaprilat potentiates the release of this factor. This effect of trandolaprilat may contribute to its vasodilator properties.", 
    "324": "A new, long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, trandolapril, was administered daily for 10 days to 13 patients with chronic renal failure [CRF; creatinine clearance (CLCR) 7-55 ml/min/1.73 m2) and 8 healthy volunteers (CLCR > 80 ml/min/1.73 m2)]. Plasma ACE inhibition parameters were the same, irrespective of the degree of renal insufficiency, although renal failure tended to prolong ACE inhibition. The pharmacokinetics of trandolapril were not affected by CRF; hence, no accumulation of trandolapril was detected. After single or repeated administration the active metabolite, trandolaprilat, showed an inverse correlation between maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) and CLCR (r = -0.676 day 1 and r = -0.864 day 10) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and CLCR (r = -0.635 day 1 and r = -0.794 day 10). The renal clearance of trandolaprilat showed significant linear correlation (r = > 0.885, p < 0.0001) with CLCR after single (r = 0.879) and repeated administration (r = 0.957). Significantly reduced excretion of trandolaprilat was seen only when the CLCR was < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. A steady state had been achieved by 7 days in all patients, and extrapolation suggested that this was achieved in most cases after 4 days. The drug was well tolerated. The effect of CRF on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of trandolaprilat is of significance only when CLCR is < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. Hence, in these patients the standard dose should be reduced.", 
    "325": "The new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril 2 mg was administered daily for 10 consecutive days to young (mean age +/- SEM 44.1 +/- 2.3 years; n = 10) and elderly (mean age +/- SEM 69.3 +/- 0.9 years; n = 14) patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. All groups had similar baseline blood pressures: mean 164/100 mm Hg. Maximal plasma ACE inhibition on day 10 and residual inhibition 24 h after the last dose was the same, irrespective of age: young, 85.2 and 57.4%; elderly 89.1 and 59.8%, respectively. There was no difference between the results on day 1 for the young and elderly groups. The absorption of trandolapril was rapid (< 1 h in all groups). The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were slightly higher in the older group, but the elimination half-life (t1/2) was the same, with no accumulation after repeat dosing. A steady-state plasma concentration of the active metabolite of trandolapril, trandolaprilat, was reached after 4 days in the two groups, with similar accumulation ratios (young, 1.48; elderly, 1.49). At steady state, the Cmax and AUC 0-24 h for trandolaprilat were similar in the two groups: young, 7.49 +/- 0.98 ng/ml and 82.27 +/- 6.95 ng/ml/h; elderly, 8.35 +/- 0.67 ng/ml/h and 96.75 +/- 5.67 ng/ml/h. Maximal reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressures (at 6 h postdose) were -14.1%/-16.1% in young patients and -14.6%/-17.5% for the elderly. Significant blood pressure reduction persisted for 48 h after the last dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "326": "The pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of trandolapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were investigated in 12 healthy male volunteers in a four-way randomized crossover study over the therapeutic dose range, 0.5-4 mg. Trandolapril is rapidly absorbed, with a single elimination half-life (t1/2) of 0.72 h, irrespective of dose. Peak plasma levels (Cmax) occurred at 0.5 h and were proportional to the dose, as was the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Concentration of the active metabolite (trandolaprilat) increased with increasing doses but in a nonlinear fashion, probably owing to saturable plasma ACE binding. However, the Cmax and AUC values for trandolaprilat were directly proportional to the highest doses, 2 and 4 mg, suggesting linear kinetics for the trandolaprilat, which is not bound to ACE. Trandolapril showed linear kinetics but trandolaprilat showed some features of nonlinear kinetics, particularly at low doses.", 
    "327": "The effects of a 3-month treatment period with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors trandolapril (0.3 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and enalapril (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) on hemodynamics, cardiac hypertrophy, and vascular structures were examined in old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) (24 months at the end of treatment) presenting with congestive heart failure. During the course of treatment, the mortality rate was lower in the two treated groups than in the control group. At the end of treatment, serum ACE activity was inhibited by 63 and 33% by trandolapril and enalapril, respectively, but the decrease in blood pressure they induced was not significant. The atrial natriuretic factor(ANF) plasma levels and cyclic GMP urine excretion were about 10-fold and 3-fold higher, respectively, in old SHRs than in old Wistar rats. These values were markedly decreased by both ACE inhibitors. The ventricular hypertrophy was greatly decreased by both compounds (-24% by trandolapril and -26% by enalapril). In the aorta, the media hypertrophy was significantly decreased and nuclear density increased to a similar extent by both ACE inhibitors. In the mesenteric artery, trandolapril treatment induced a complete regression of the media hypertrophy and a marked decrease in extracellular matrix surface. In addition, the collagen network appeared less dissociated in the treated animals. Similarly the nuclear density was increased and the surface of cell nuclei was decreased by trandolapril. Enalapril appeared much less potent on these parameters. These data demonstrate that treatment with trandolapril of aged SHRs presenting with heart failure results in an increase in survival of the animals and a marked regression of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "328": "The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trandolapril were studied using a Goldblatt (two-kidney, one-clip) rat model of renovascular hypertension after 4 weeks of oral treatment at 0.3 or 1 mg/kg/day. The effects of trandolapril on blood pressure and on cardiac and vascular hypertrophy were analyzed in comparison with the control group. Trandolapril produced a rapid, dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure, which plateaued after 2 weeks of treatment. Complete normalization of blood pressure was observed at a daily dose of 1 mg/kg. Dose-dependent inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy was also observed, heart:body weight ratio being decreased by 17 and 30% at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively, leading to a normalization of this parameter at the higher dose compared with normotensive controls. Similarly, trandolapril produced a marked decrease in vascular wall hypertrophy in both the mesenteric artery and the aorta. Indeed, complete normalization of media thickness was observed, compared with the normotensive control group, at 1 mg/kg of trandolapril. These results show that short-term treatment with trandolapril can induce complete regression of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy, which is associated with the development of renal hypertension.", 
    "329": "The age-related changes in the structure and the function of the kidney and the effect of chronic inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity on these alterations were assessed in senescent, genetically hypertensive rats. Mean blood pressure was unchanged between 6 and 21 months, being 136 +/- 10 and 135 +/- 21 mm Hg, respectively. Hypertrophy of the glomeruli with a high incidence of glomerulosclerosis was reported in the 21-month-old animals. Renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and filtration fraction were reduced between 6 and 21 months, whereas albuminuria and cGMP excretion were markedly enhanced with aging. Chronic ACE inhibition by administration of 0.3 mg/kg/day trandolapril from 18-21 months increased the life expectancy of the animals without affecting their mean blood pressure. The incidence of glomerular lesions and the excretion of enzymes that reflected the integrity of tubular and glomerular cells were not altered by ACE inhibition. On the other hand, the filtration fraction was restored in the 21-month-old treated animals, and the age-related albuminuria and rise in cGMP excretion were prevented by ACE inhibition. These results indicated that ACE inhibitor administered at the end of the life of senescent hypertensive rats was able to prevent some of the age-related changes in kidney function when glomerulosclerosis was already present.", 
    "330": "The dose-related effects of trandolapril on serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy were studied after 2-week oral treatment in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats. Trandolapril caused a dose-dependent decrease in mean blood pressure at doses of 0.03-3 mg/kg. Inhibition of serum ACE was demonstrated by even the lowest dose (-9% at 0.003 mg/kg), was about 40% at 0.03 mg/kg, and rose to 84% at 3 mg/kg. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy (heart:body weight) was seen at doses of trandolapril as low as 0.03 mg/kg (-5.1%), which was also the minimal effective antihypertensive dose. Clear dose-response curves were observed for trandolapril from 0.03 mg/kg upwards with respect to hypotensive effect and regression of cardiac hypertrophy, which were not seen with enalapril. Enalapril had no significant effect on plasma ACE activity except at the highest dose (10 mg/kg), despite demonstrating hypotensive effects with smaller doses. These results indicate that trandolapril is a more potent (by a factor of about 30) inhibitor of ACE than enalapril (only 34% inhibition at 10 mg/kg) and causes a greater degree of regression of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "331": "The effects of 14-day trandolapril or enalapril treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were studied on blood pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity measured ex vivo in various organs. Both ACE inhibitors caused dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and ACE activity, trandolapril being 30- and 400- to 1,000-fold more active than enalapril on blood pressure and ACE activity, respectively. However, comparison of ACE inhibitory activities of the diacid forms of trandolapril and enalapril, i.e., trandolaprilat and enalaprilat, measured in vitro on various tissues, showed that trandolaprilat was only three- to fivefold more active than enalaprilat. To understand the reasons for such discrepancies between ex vivo effects of ACE inhibitors and in vitro actions of their diacid metabolites, we measured the lipophilicities of the compounds and investigated the possibility that trandolapril could display an ACE inhibitory effect by itself. Trandolaprilat was found to be far more lipophilic than enalaprilat, as shown by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography studies performed at pH 7.4 (log kw7.4 = 1.487 vs. 0.108). In addition, trandolapril was practically as active in vitro as its diacid metabolite (IC50 = 2.5 vs. 1.35 nM) in inhibiting ACE activity in the aorta, whereas enalapril was practically devoid of any effect (IC50 = 240 nM). Measurements of relative affinities of inhibitors or metabolites for purified human renal ACE showed that trandolapril displayed about 20% of the affinity of its diacid metabolite (IC50 = 15 vs. 3.2 nM); enalaprilat affinity (34 nM) was within the same range as those of trandolapril and trandolaprilat, whereas enalapril displayed a very low affinity for the purified enzyme (IC50 = 50 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "332": "Experiments were designed to study the effects of trandolaprilat on endothelium-dependent responses in isolated blood vessels. Rings of either femoral or left circumflex coronary arteries of the dog or thoracic aortas of normotensive rats were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. During contractions induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha, trandolaprilat did not cause direct endothelium-dependent or -independent relaxation. However, when given to preparations incubated with angiotensin I or bradykinin, the compound evoked significant endothelium-dependent relaxation. By contrast, trandolaprilat failed to cause any change in tension when given in the presence of acetylcholine (ACh). In rings of femoral arteries, trandolaprilat potentiated the endothelium-dependent relaxation evoked by bradykinin and adenosine diphosphate; it did not modify the endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by ACh, substance P, or thrombin. In rings of femoral arteries without endothelium, trandolaprilat augmented relaxation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) but not by adenosine. In perfused coronary arteries with but not those without endothelium, trandolaprilat caused relaxation in the absence of exogenous bradykinin (or ADP). These experiments suggest that trandolaprilat does not directly release endothelium-derived relaxing factor from the endothelial cells, does not interfere with the ability of the endothelium to release endothelium-derived relaxing factor, augments the endothelium-dependent responses to bradykinin (given exogenously or produced locally) and angiotensin I by direct interaction with converting enzyme, and potentiates the relaxation induced by ADP by augmenting its direct effect on vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "333": "The Veterans Affairs Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trials (V-HeFT I and II) provided information about heart failure treated with conventional therapy, and evaluated the long term efficacy of vasodilators. In V-HeFT I, the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate provided a beneficial effect on prognosis in heart failure. V-HeFT II demonstrated that enalapril had a more favourable effect on 2-year survival than a combination of hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate. However, the hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate combination exerted the most favourable short term impact on exercise performance and left ventricular ejection fraction. The V-HeFT studies showed that, although not all vasodilators are alike, their differing effects might be beneficial when used in combination. Determination of the potential additive effect of the calcium antagonist felodipine, a vasodilator, when used in combination with an ACE inhibitor, is the major goal of V-HeFT III.", 
    "334": "Exercise intolerance is one of the primary characteristics of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Therefore, exercise testing has been widely used in the assessment of CHF patients, both to define the severity of the disease and to assess the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents in clinical trials. A number of different exercise tests can be used, although maximal exercise testing is the most common. Maximal exercise capacity can be determined by measuring exercise duration during incremental exercise, or maximal oxygen (O2) consumption, or it can be estimated by anaerobic threshold. While baseline exercise testing in CHF patients accurately identifies and quantifies cardiac failure and determines prognosis, it is of limited value in assessing changes that occur as a result of drug therapy. A key drawback of exercise testing as a measurement of drug effect is the fact that exercise changes produced by drug intervention do not correlate well with changes in the mortality rate. Several examples of the lack of correlation between exercise testing and mortality rates have been observed in clinical trials with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and vasodilators. ACE inhibitors have a modest effect on maximal exercise capacity but they improve survival. It is thought that neuroendocrine activation more closely reflects mortality rates and also the changes in survival observed with pharmacological intervention compared with other modes of evaluation.", 
    "335": "Congestive heart failure is the end product of a progressive series of events resulting from acute myocardial damage. Circulatory neurohormonal systems are activated during the acute phase of left ventricular dysfunction resulting from initial myocardial damage and again in the latter phase of decompensated heart failure. However, these neurohormonal mechanisms return to normal during the compensated stage of heart failure. Recent studies have suggested that autocrine/paracrine modulators of cardiovascular function are activated in the preclinical phase preceding the development of overt heart failure. The renin-angiotensin system in particular has been shown to modulate many of the chronic processes involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disorders. Recent studies suggest that locally generated angiotensin II may contribute to the secondary structural changes seen in cardiovascular disorders, such as cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling, coronary artery disease, and atherosclerosis. Thus, inhibition of angiotensin formation with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, particularly at the tissue level, may provide valuable cardioprotective effects. Additional evidence points to the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in preventing the progression of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to overt heart failure.", 
    "336": "Experimental data indicate the existence of a vascular tissue renin-angiotensin system in several different vessels from various animal models. Active renin can be locally synthesized into the vessel wall or taken up from circulating plasma to produce vascular angiotensin II. Using the human forearm technique, we produced evidence indicating the release of active and inactive renin and of angiotensin II from the vessels of hypertensive patients. Moreover, the production of vascular angiotensin II seems to be strictly correlated to the circulating renin profile, suggesting the possibility that vascular renin might be at least partially taken up from plasma. To investigate a possible function of the vascular renin-angiotensin system, we studied its interaction with sympathetic neurotransmission in essential hypertensive patients. In line with animal studies, vascular angiotensin II increases the vasoconstriction induced by the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system through the potentiation of noradrenaline release at a presynaptic level, and this effect seems to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptor activation. This facilitating effect on sympathetic neurotransmission exerted by vascular angiotensin II can be antagonized by both angiotensin II antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "337": "No large mortality trials have been completed comparing either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium-entry-blocking drugs with placebo or established drugs in the treatment of hypertension, although these are now about to start. Several large mortality studies in ischemic heart disease or cardiac failure allow us to make some general comments in favor of ACE inhibitors separately, or in favor of some calcium-channel blockers separately. There is no mortality evidence for first-generation dihydropyridines, but rather the reverse. There is good evidence in favor of verapamil and diltiazem, perhaps because of their lack of peripheral vasodilatation and reflex tachycardia. No large studies have been carried out comparing calcium-channel blockers with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "338": "A number of changes in intrarenal hemodynamics and morphology are characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. These changes include: increases in intraglomerular pressure and volume, glomerular capillary permeability to macromolecules, and mesangial matrix expansion. Most antihypertensive drugs attenuate some of the increases in these parameters. Certain antihypertensive agents, however, have effects on all these parameters. Studies in animal models of diabetes demonstrate that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce both intraglomerular volume and pressure, mesangial matrix expansion, and albuminuria. The calcium antagonists TA-3090 (diltiazem-like) and verapamil recently have been shown to have most of these effects. Conversely, the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (nifedipine, felodipine, nitrendipine) do not attenuate increases in most of these parameters. In several clinical studies, nifedipine either did not affect or increased urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients with renal insufficiency. Moreover, in animal models of diabetes, most dihydropyridine compounds do not prevent progression of glomerulosclerosis in spite of blood pressure control. Although the majority of clinical studies support the concept that reduction of arterial pressure preserves renal function, recent long-term clinical studies show that ACE inhibitors and heart-rate-lowering calcium antagonists (diltiazem, verapamil) attenuate progression of diabetes to a greater extent than most other agents do.", 
    "339": "So-called insulin resistance is a frequent phenomenon and a marker of increased risk for both type II diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Today, insulin resistance is widely understood as a tissue- and pathway-specific defect of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle that is compensated for by hyperinsulinemia, leading to a cluster of undesirable hypertensiogenic, diabetogenic, and atherogenic processes. Additional defects of insulin-stimulated muscle blood flow and cellular kation balance are presently attracting increasing awareness. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition ameliorates both insulin-stimulated skeletal-muscle glucose uptake and blood flow in insulin-resistant states by a direct stimulation of cellular glucose uptake, which appears to be kinin-mediated. This improvement of insulin sensitivity could mean not only improvement of glucose metabolism, but also reduction of chronically elevated serum insulin and the ensuing atherogenic consequences (hyper- and dyslipidemia, sympathetic overactivity, growth of vascular smooth-muscle cells, hypertension, etc.). Ca(2+)-channel blockers that do not increase heart rate appear to exert direct antiatherogenic effects while being metabolically neutral. Thus, the combination of Ca(2+)-channel blockade by sustained release verapamil and ACE inhibition by trandolapril in insulin-resistant type II diabetic patients with essential hypertension appears to be promising in terms of possible synergistic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "340": "We investigated the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril (2 mg/o.d.) on the physical work capacity (PWC), the received perception of exertion (RPE), as well as parameters determining physical performance (i.e., energy metabolism, lactate production, and oxygen uptake) in well-trained, healthy subjects. Twenty male sports students underwent a bicycle spiroergometry until exhaustion to determine maximum work load, maximum oxygen uptake, lactate threshold, and parameters of energy metabolism. The identical protocol was repeated after a 14-day treatment period with 2 mg of trandolapril o.d. or placebo. Treatment with the ACE inhibitor did not significantly alter maximum PWC, RPE, 4.0 mmol/L lactate threshold, heart rate, maximum oxygen uptake, plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, glucose, insulin, cortisol, and human growth hormone. In the presence of the ACE inhibitor, the exercise-induced increase in systolic blood pressure was moderately (n.s.) blunted (204 +/- 7 versus 192 +/- 7 mm Hg). Treatment with the ACE inhibitor did not impair physical performance and RPE. This favorable profile of action was accompanied by no alterations in maximum oxygen uptake and parameters of energy metabolism at all levels of exercise intensity. Therefore, it may be concluded that antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor should be primarily considered in physically active patients.", 
    "341": "Elevated arterial pressure levels increase the hemodynamic load on heart and vessels, thus leading to functional and structural abnormalities. Because cardiac and vascular changes increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, their reversal is an important target of antihypertensive therapy, even though the prognostic value of this regression has not been fully established. In patients with untreated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, trandolapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, reduces blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral resistance and improves both systolic and diastolic ventricular function. The latter effect is not only functional in nature because, after long-term antihypertensive treatment, the improvement in diastolic ventricular function is detectable also after 1-month withdrawal of trandolapril. The concurrent reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy may contribute to the improved left ventricular diastolic function. However, plethysmographic studies suggest that long-term antihypertensive treatment with trandolapril is also able to reverse structural vascular changes in the forearm vascular bed, because after 1-month washout forearm peripheral resistance also is lower than in control conditions. Finally, in hypertensive patients, trandolapril induces significant increases in brachial artery compliance and diameter that persist after 1 month of withdrawal from treatment. The latter observation suggests that trandolapril also is able to reverse the structural changes of the large artery wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "342": "The use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in clinical studies offers some advantages in comparison to the clinic blood pressure measurement. In fact, this approach does not induce any alerting reaction and provides 24-h blood pressure values that are more reproducible and not affected by the placebo effect. This allows a better evaluation of blood pressure under antihypertensive treatment and an optimization of the number of patients to be studied in pharmacologic trials. In a recent double-blind, parallel-group study, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was used to investigate the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, trandolapril, in 62 mild and moderate hypertensive patients. After a washout period, patients received trandolapril, 2 mg o.d., or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a second washout period. Clinic and 24-h blood pressures were assessed at the end of each period. In comparing the pre- and post-treatment period, trandolapril significantly reduced clinic and 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The fall was evident throughout the 24 h and was statistically significant also in the last 4 h of blood pressure monitoring. The placebo group did not show any significant blood pressure change. Thus, trandolapril, 2 mg once daily, is effective in reducing blood pressure. Its efficacy over 24 h is better documented by 24-h blood pressure monitoring than by isolated clinic blood pressure measurement.", 
    "343": "Data of 52 patients, 29 women and 23 men aged 32-68 years (mean age 47 years) with essential hypertension, participating in three open therapeutic trials with either enalapril, lisinopril, or perindopril were evaluated to assess the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on glucose and lipid metabolism. The 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) was performed, and plasma glucose and insulin levels, as well as total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides levels were determined before and after the 8- to 12-week treatment. Minor differences in the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect and metabolic response were obtained with the ACE inhibitors studied; only lisinopril improved glucose tolerance significantly; blood lipids were not changed by any drug. The entire patient population showed only a slight reduction in 1-h postload glucose after treatment. More obvious improvement in glucose tolerance was evident in hypertensive patients who were glucose intolerant and/or insulin resistant (GI/IR, 53.8% of all), however. This subgroup also showed a slight but not significant increase in HDL-cholesterol and a decrease in triglycerides levels. Only a slight change or no change in plasma glucose, insulin, and lipid values was noted in hypertensive patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and insulin sensitivity. These favorable effects were expressed only after ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but not when hydrochlorothiazide was added. The results indicate that a lack of stratification of hypertensive patients with regard to glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity could be a confounding factor in evaluation of metabolic effects of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "344": "The effects of trandolapril, a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), on left ventricular (LV) diastolic stiffness and coronary vascular resistance (CVR), were studied with an isolated heart preparation in 15-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The hypertensive animals were treated for 3 months with trandolapril (0.3 mg/kg/day) (SHRT), and compared with untreated age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR. Trandolapril treatment resulted in 15% diminution in blood pressure (BP). In contrast, it completely normalized left ventricular (LV) weight. Untreated SHR, as compared with WKY, had a dilated LV and increased diastolic tissue stiffness. Trandolapril had no effect on either chamber or tissue stiffness. Five-minute anoxia resulted in the same dramatic increase in chamber stiffness in every experimental group. During anoxia, as during normoxia, tissue stiffness was still greater in SHR than in WKY. A major effect of CEI was to normalize the tissue stiffness of SHR under anoxia. Coronary vascular resistance (CVR) was increased in SHR as compared with WKY. Trandolapril improves CVR and significantly shifts the coronary pressure flow curve to the dilatory side. Both collagen concentration (approximately 2 mg/g) and the content in slow V3 myosin isoform, used as biologic markers of cardiac senescence, were the same in the three experimental groups, but higher than in young hearts. Trandolapril had no effect on these parameters. In semisenescent SHR, despite having rather slight effect on arterial pressure, trandolapril completely normalized LV weight. In addition, collagen content and its physiologic counterpart, tissue stiffness, were unaffected by 3-month treatment with trandolapril. Nevertheless, the anoxia-induced increase in LV tissue stiffness was improved by trandolapril in parallel with reduction in LV hypertrophy (LVH).", 
    "345": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in high-output heart failure have not yet been well established. We evaluated the effects of lisinopril (3 mg/kg/day) on hemodynamics, neurohormones, and survival in 10-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with aortocaval fistula. Sham-operated treated and untreated SHR served as controls. Cardiac output (CO) was determined by thermodilution method, and renal blood flow (RBF) was assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry. In sham-operated SHR, 2-week treatment with lisinopril decreased blood pressure (BP), left ventricular (LV) weight, and total peripheral resistance (TPR) (p < 0.01 each) and increased RBF and plasma renin activity (PRA) (both p < 0.05); CO and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were unchanged. Fistula creation induced biventricular hypertrophy and high-output heart failure [increased LVEDP, CO, pulse pressure, and plasma norepinephrine (NE) and decreased RBF] with congestive signs (ascites, tachypnea). Lisinopril decreased LVEDP (p < 0.01), increased RBF, prolonged survival (both p < 0.05), and prevented ascites (0 vs. 46%) and increased PRA (p < 0.05) and attenuated the increase in plasma NE. Heart weight, BP, and CO were not affected by lisinopril. Thus, lisinopril ameliorated congestion and improved survival in SHR with fistula without compromising cardiorenal hemodynamics. Venous and renal dilatation and attenuation of vasoconstrictive systems may have contributed to the beneficial effects.", 
    "346": "Peptide 6A, a degradation of B beta chain of fibrinogen, is known to increase coronary and femoral blood flow. In this study, we examined the effects of peptide 32, an analogue of peptide 6A on coronary blood flow in anesthetized dogs. Intracoronary administration of equimolar amounts of peptide 32 and peptide 6A showed a greater (p < 0.05) increase in blood flow with peptide 32. Intravenous administration of peptide 32 also resulted in greater and longer-lasting increase in coronary blood flow. The greater blood flow enhancing effect of peptide 32 than that of peptide 6A may relate to absence of its degradation by angiotensin converting enzyme.",

We performed three separate studies: acetorphan versus placebo and cilazapril versus placebo, in normal subjects (n = 6 and n = 8, respectively), and acetorphan versus cilazapril versus placebo in patients with allergic rhinitis (n = 6). In normal as well as in rhinitic subjects, SP decreased nasal conductance in a dose-dependent fashion (p < 0.001). With placebo, the decrease in nasal conductance in normal subjects was similar to that in patients with allergic rhinitis (p > 0.5). In normal subjects, acetorphan potentiated the decrease in nasal conductance (p < 0.001), whereas cilazapril did not (p = 0.12). In patients with allergic rhinitis, the decrease in nasal conductance was potentiated by acetorphan (p < 0.001) and by cilazapril (p < 0.001). With acetorphan, the decrease in nasal conductance was not different in patients with allergic rhinitis and in normal subjects (p > 0.9). Conversely, with cilazapril, the nasal response to SP was greater in patients with allergic rhinitis than in normal subjects (p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "350": "Overall, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a very low side-effect profile. However, several reports in the literature cite cough as a possible complication of ACE inhibitor therapy. These reports have prompted speculation that the risk of cough may differ among ACE inhibitors and that the risk may be greater in patients with renal impairment, perhaps because of excessive drug accumulation. However, these hypotheses have not been tested in prospective, controlled studies. Fosinopril is a long-acting ACE inhibitor with a unique chemical structure and an elimination profile that is associated with stable clearance, regardless of the degree of renal impairment. Favorable clinical experience with fosinopril led to the evaluation of this agent's cough profile in a prospective, open-label study. This study focused on the frequency of cough in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension who had previously experienced cough while taking another ACE inhibitor. Whereas most prior controlled studies and postmarketing surveillance trials measured the frequency of cough through spontaneous adverse-event reporting, in this study a methodology previously validated in antitussive and mucolytic studies was adapted to provide accurate and sensitive measure of fosinopril's cough profile. Twenty-four patients were switched from another ACE inhibitor to fosinopril, 10 mg once daily for 6 weeks. At study end, the mean occurrence of cough, frequency of cough, and cough severity significantly changed from baseline (p < or = 0.0002). Thus, fosinopril use was associated with a less frequent, less severe cough in patients who experienced cough while taking other ACE inhibitors.", 
    "351": "It is generally believed that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has no effect on the lipid profile. Our recent data show that in patients with proteinuric renal disease, serum levels of total cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] may be lowered during treatment with an ACE inhibitor, fosinopril sodium. During a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study involving 26 patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment, fosinopril administration was associated with significant decreases in both urinary protein excretion and serum total cholesterol levels, whereas placebo was not. During a 6-week washout phase, both parameters returned to baseline in fosinopril-treated patients and remained unchanged in placebo recipients. In addition, fosinopril-treated patients had a decrease in plasma levels of Lp(a), whereas this was not seen in placebo-treated patients. When data from a subset of 13 patients with proteinuric renal disease and hypertension were examined, a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol levels was observed; this decrease reversed after discontinuation of fosinopril. Analysis of the effect of fosinopril on plasma Lp(a) levels in a subset of patients who had type II diabetes mellitus and overt proteinuria revealed a significant decrease in plasma Lp(a) after administration of fosinopril. Moreover, fosinopril lowered plasma Lp(a) levels in blacks, whose pretreatment levels were higher than those of whites with comparable degrees of proteinuria and levels of serum total cholesterol. Thus, the reduction in serum Lp(a) levels may be related not only to amelioration of proteinuria, but also to another direct action of fosinopril on the metabolism of Lp(a).", 
    "352": "In January 1993 the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure published its fifth report (JNC V). The report highlighted the importance of systolic hypertension and recommended that hypertension should be diagnosed--regardless of age--when systolic blood pressure readings are consistently > or = 140 mm Hg. JNC V reflected the opinion in JNC IV that several drug classes--including diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and alpha blockers--are suitable for initiating antihypertensive therapy. However, JNC V gave preference to diuretics and beta blockers because these drug classes have been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular events in clinical trials; similar studies with the newer drug classes have not yet been completed. This recommendation is highly controversial because the benefits of diuretic and beta-blocker use are most evident in the elderly, and the beneficial effects of these drugs on the incidence of coronary events are relatively modest. Further, growing experience with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists shows that these agents lack the metabolic disadvantages of older agents and can exhibit antiatherosclerotic and antihypertrophic vasoactivity. Although to date the clinical benefits of the newer agents have been documented in conditions other than hypertension, the data are persuasive and indicate a probability that these drugs will improve prognosis in hypertensive patients. JNC V also emphasized lifestyle modifications; however, even when they decrease blood pressure, dietary and other nonpharmacologic strategies have not been shown to lower the incidence of clinical events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "353": "Development of an increased systemic vascular resistance and the concomitant increase in blood pressure are associated with significant changes in left ventricular structure and function. The plasma and tissue renin-angiotensin systems play an important, but variable, role in the regulation of blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance in normotensive and hypertensive patients. Non-angiotensin-mediated effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or differential tissue specificities may result in a variable hemodynamic response to individual therapies. Using first-pass radionuclide cineangiography, the hemodynamic effects of captopril, lisinopril, and fosinopril were compared. Fosinopril induced a greater reduction in systemic vascular resistance than did equipotent hypotensive doses of captopril or lisinopril and was associated with an increase in cardiac output, left ventricular peak ejection rate, and left ventricular peak filling rate. Along with previously accumulated data, these results suggest that structural differences among ACE inhibitors may result in unique physiologic effects. Fosinopril appears to have a cardiotropic effect that causes improved left ventricular diastolic performance; this effect is unique among currently available ACE inhibitors. The clinical significance of the unique profiles of individual ACE inhibitors awaits assessment via comparative clinical investigations.", 
    "354": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are an effective, well-tolerated option for management of mild-to-moderate hypertension. An increase of nearly 250% in prescriptions between 1986 and 1990 testifies to the growing importance of this drug class. With the development of newer ACE inhibitors, the debate on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences and the clinical relevance of such differences has also been growing in importance. It is in this context that the clinical data on fosinopril will be reviewed. Fosinopril has several intriguing features, among them a unique chemical structure and elimination profile. In addition, preliminary data on cardiac effects and on risk for cough are provocative and support further study. The antihypertensive efficacy of fosinopril is comparable to other ACE inhibitors. Thus, fosinopril represents an interesting and useful addition to this antihypertensive class.", 
    "355": "Antihypertensive treatment in the diabetic patient is a critical issue because hypertension has an impact on all of the vascular complications of diabetes, including nephropathy, retinopathy, atherosclerosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. These complications are a consequence of altered endothelial-vascular smooth muscle interrelations that ultimately enhance vasoconstriction and alter the remodeling processes in the vascular wall. Several observations suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be an important contributor to these processes in diabetes mellitus. In both animal and human studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been demonstrated to slow the progression of glomerulosclerosis, prevent abnormal remodeling processes in the heart following injury, and slow the progression of atherosclerosis. In particular, ACE inhibitors appear to protect the kidney more than would be expected from simply the lowering of blood pressure and decreasing of intraglomerular pressure, possibly because angiotensin II has both hemodynamic and direct effects on the glomerulus. Paradoxically, however, the activity of the circulating RAS is low in diabetic patients. Part of these seemingly inconsistent observations may be due to (1) potential activity of tissue RASs, (2) increased sensitivity to angiotensin II in diabetes, or (3) an effect of ACE inhibition on other systems in addition to the RAS. Investigation of these mechanisms will be important in determining the therapeutic role of inhibition of the RAS in diabetes mellitus.", 
    "356": "The highest prevalence of hypertension is now recognized to exist in the elderly segment of the population. With the completion of several large-scale studies, several of our assumptions regarding elderly hypertensive patients have changed. It is now clear that the elderly have shown the greatest benefit from antihypertensive therapy. This favorable risk-benefit ratio extends to even the very elderly; treatment for hypertension is appropriate for healthy elderly individuals, regardless of age. It also extends to elderly individuals who have already experienced the consequences of elevated blood pressure. Attitudes toward antihypertensive agents have also evolved. Diuretics are appropriate monotherapy in many patients, when the dose is kept low. The usefulness of calcium antagonists has been confirmed, whereas beta blocker use appears to be indicated only in certain subgroups. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have also been shown to be effective in elderly patients, despite earlier studies whose results describe low plasma renin activity in the elderly.",

Binding to AT1 receptors, located in the subfornical organ, paraventricular nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract and choroid plexus, was sensitive to incubation with GTP gamma S. The sensitivity of AT2 receptors to GTP gamma S was heterogeneous. In the ventral thalamic, rostral hypoglossal and medial geniculate nuclei, and in the locus coeruleus, binding to AT2 receptors was sensitive to GTP gamma S and these areas belong to the AT2A subgroup. Conversely, in the inferior olive, medial (fastigial) cerebellar nucleus and caudal part of the hypoglossal nucleus, areas belonging to the AT2B subgroup, binding was insensitive to GTP gamma S. AT2 receptors were also present in cerebral arteries. In the fetal anterior pituitary, AT1 receptors predominated. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) was studied by autoradiography with the selective inhibitor [125I]351A. In 19-day-old embryos, ACE was highly expressed in choroid plexus, with high concentrations in subfornical organ, posterior pituitary and cerebral arteries. No ACE binding was detected in extrapyramidal structures or anterior pituitary in 19-day-old embryos.", 
    "358": "The effects of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on congestive heart failure (CHF) were investigated in animal and clinical studies. Congestive heart failure was induced in rats by a combination of pressure and volume overload. Cardiac pressure overload was induced by constricting one renal artery (Goldblatt rat) and volume overload was induced by aorto-caval fistula. Captopril (100 mg/kg/day) was then administered for 14 weeks. Isometric contraction was assessed using isolated left ventricular papillary muscles. The maximum developed tension and the maximum rate of increase in tension (dT/dtmax) were decreased in untreated rats with CHF and improved in captopril-treated rats. The left ventricular myosin isoenzyme pattern was shifted towards V3 in untreated rats with CHF, and was shifted back towards V1 in the captopril-treated rats. In the clinical study, captopril (37.5-75 mg/day) was administered to patients with cardiomyopathy for 12 months. There was no effect on left ventricular mass in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, although systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve disappeared in one patient. In dilated cardiomyopathy, however, left ventricular mass tended to decrease. These results indicate that captopril has a beneficial effect in congestive heart failure.", 
    "359": "To determine the mechanism of endothelium-dependent relaxation by bradykinin, we simultaneously measured changes in cytosolic calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and force of fura-2-loaded strips of porcine coronary artery. We also examined effects of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on bradykinin-induced relaxation. Bradykinin, in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-10) to 10(-7) M), decreased both [Ca2+]i and force to resting levels, during 10(-5) M prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced contractions, only when endothelium was intact. Treatment with 10(-5) M captopril enhanced the bradykinin-induced decreases in [Ca2+]i and force and shifted the concentration-response curve to the left. During 118 mM K+ depolarization, bradykinin induced a greater relaxation than that expected from the reduction in [Ca2+]i. Captopril had no effects on the relationship between reduction in [Ca2+]i and relaxation induced by bradykinin. Bradykinin relaxes porcine coronary artery in an endothelium-dependent manner, by decreasing [Ca2+]i and also by controlling the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus of smooth muscle. Captopril enhanced the bradykinin-induced relaxation, with no apparent direct effect on Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus.", 
    "360": "Left ventricular dysfunction and dilation after reperfusion relate to the amount of infarcted and dysfunctional myocardium and will continue to be important determinants of morbidity and mortality. There is marked heterogeneity in the anatomic and pathophysiologic presentation of patients with acute myocardial infarction prior to thrombolysis, and many of these individual settings resemble those in animal species with various degrees of collateral formation. Three major determinants of infarct size are responsible for this heterogeneity and include the risk area, the duration of the coronary occlusion, and the level of the residual coronary blood flow via collaterals or a partially patent artery. All 3 of these determinants will influence the initial and late results of reperfusion therapy on infarct size and ventricular function. However, in addition to late or unsuccessful thrombolysis, there are other important factors determining outcome: inadequate reflow, residual coronary stenosis, and coronary reocclusion, factors that can be associated with late progressive left ventricular dilation and dysfunction. The risk factors for left ventricular dysfunction and dilation after reperfusion can now be identified, and such patients should undergo coronary angiography prior to hospital discharge and, if appropriate, revascularization of the infarct-related artery (and perhaps other vessels). In other patients, if serial studies reveal progressive left ventricular failure and dilation late after reperfusion, despite therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and if repeat coronary angiography identifies significant coronary stenoses and areas of hibernating or stunned myocardium, revascularization may limit progression of dilation and improve left ventricular function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "361": "Studies in animals and humans have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can prevent or at least attenuate ventricular dilation and remodeling following acute myocardial infarction (MI) and can improve subsequent left ventricular dysfunction, a strong predictor of survival. The question as to which patients will benefit most from ACE inhibitor therapy and the optimal timing of administration of such intervention after the onset of symptoms is still matter of debate, even if it is hypothesized that a greater benefit in terms of remodeling prevention may occur after early administration. However, while it is currently accepted that patients with asymptomatic postinfarctual left ventricular dysfunction can benefit from long-term administration of an ACE inhibitor when therapy is started late, the usefulness of an early administration is still to be clarified. In this setting, the question of early versus late ACE inhibitor treatment has to be related to the different evolving pattern of myocardial infarction with regard to the different degrees of postinfarction ventricular dysfunction and neurohormonal activation, whose extent could influence the effect of ACE inhibition. For example, not all patients with acute MI show progressive ventricular dilation. Early dilation is frequent in patients with anterior localization of necrosis, whereas it is usually not relevant in patients with acute inferior MI. Thus, different postinfarction patterns may differently influence the clinical success of therapeutic interventions, which can be instituted at various stages following acute MI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "362": "Major advances in the management of acute myocardial infarction have been achieved by a combination of careful experimental work and development of effective pharmacologic and interventional strategies in conjunction with the conduct of large, reliable randomized trials. Current trials indicate that a combination of thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, and intravenous followed by oral beta blockers reduces mortality. There are a number of additional promising interventions, such as intravenous magnesium, nitrates, and the newer antithrombin agents. However, before these agents are used widely in clinical practice, clear proof of benefit and adequate safety should be available from the ongoing randomized trials. Following discharge from the hospital, long-term therapy with aspirin and beta blockers should be considered in all patients. In patients with heart failure and low ejection fraction, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality, reinfarction, and the need for further hospitalizations for heart failure. Therefore, these therapies, in conjunction with risk factor modification (cessation of cigarette smoking, treatment of hypercholesterolemia, treatment of hypertension), should be considered in all appropriate patients. A number of new strategies for the prevention of atherosclerosis and its complications are currently being evaluated in prospective randomized trials. These include the natural antioxidant vitamins, estrogen replacement therapy, tamoxifen therapy, and ACE inhibitors in patients without evidence of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "363": "Human intestinal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) exists in the brush-border membrane as a monomeric protein of apparent molecular mass 184 kDa. It is associated with the membrane via a hydrophobic segment and has a transmembrane orientation [Naim (1992) Biochem. J. 286, 451-457]. In addition to the membrane-bound form (ACEm), hydrophilic forms of ACE (ACEsec) can be identified in biosynthetically labelled intestinal cells. Thus the culture medium of biosynthetically labelled human biopsy samples contains an ACE molecule which has an apparent molecular mass similar to that of its membrane-bound counterpart. The secreted ACEsec forms follow a precursor/product relationship with the mature ACE molecule. The effect of the monomeric structure of ACE in its intracellular transport and secretion was investigated by pulse-chase experiments on human biopsy samples labelled with [35S]methionine. The results reveal 2-3-fold slower transport of ACE from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi as compared with the homodimeric proteins dipeptidylpeptidase IV and aminopeptidase N. Further, the transport kinetics of ACE are comparable with those of human sucrase-isomaltase and human maltase-glucoamylase, two brush-border disaccharidases that do not form homodimers in the ER of human small-intestinal cells. These findings strongly suggest that homodimerization of brush-border proteins may influence the rate of transport of these proteins from the ER to the Golgi. The effect of glycosylation on the transport and secretion of ACE was investigated by utilizing several inhibitors of glycan processing. Here, secretion of ACE molecules continued to take place, albeit to a considerably lesser extent. In fact, approx. 2-fold less ACE molecules were secreted in the presence of inhibitors of ER glucosidases I and II and cis-Golgi mannosidase-I, suggesting that carbohydrate processing is important in the attainment of a transport-competent conformation.", 
    "364": "Captopril and enalapril, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), have been associated with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Such drug reactions may be caused by the formation of reactive metabolites by cytochrome P450 isozymes, which can then cause direct or immune-mediated toxicity. Previously, we have demonstrated that enalapril cytotoxicity in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes was due, at least in part, to cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism, and that glutathione was involved in the detoxification process. In the present study, we extended our investigations into mechanisms of cytotoxicity, using rat hepatocyte cultures, to captopril and three recently marketed ACEIs: fosinopril, lisinopril and quinapril. After 24 hr of exposure to lisinopril or enalaprilat (the deesterified metabolite of enalapril), hepatocytes did not show any evidence of cytotoxicity, measured by lactate dehydrogenase leakage, even at 10 mM drug concentrations. The other ACEIs were toxic to the liver cells, with the rank order of toxicity as quinapril (LC50 = 0.28 mM) > fosinopril (LC50 = 0.4 mM) > enalapril (LC50 = 2.0 mM) > captopril (LC50 = 20 mM). In vivo pretreatment of rats with pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile to induce isozymes of the P450 3A subfamily significantly enhanced the cytotoxicities of quinapril, fosinopril and enalapril but did not affect captopril cytotoxicity. Pretreatment with P450 inducers selective for other isozyme subfamilies (ethanol, beta-naphthoflavone and phenobarbital) did not alter the in vitro toxicity of any of the ACEIs. Co-incubation with SKF525-A (15 microM) or troleandomycin (0.1 mM) reduced the hepatocidal toxicities of quinapril, fosinopril and enalapril. Preincubation with buthionine sulfoximine (2 mM) enhanced the cytotoxicities of quinapril, fosinopril, enalapril and captopril. The results of this study indicate that like enalapril, quinapril and fosinopril can also undergo P450 3A-dependent bioactivation and require maintenance of glutathione status for detoxification, and that captopril causes cytotoxicity independent of cytochrome P450 metabolism.",

The radiological and sonographic examinations showed a thickened wall of the left hemicolon. Colonoscopy revealed a sharply delineated segment with pronounced inflammation in the descending colon and the proximal sigmoid colon, suggestive for an ischemic colitis. Histology of the inflamed colon was compatible with this diagnosis. Under suspended enteral feeding and antibiotic therapy the symptoms disappeared within two weeks, and a control colonoscopy six weeks later was completely normal. 1 1/2 years later the patient suffered from a second episode of ischemic colitis exactly a the same site.

    "368": "Chemical modifications of 2 specific residues present in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) result in its inactivation, thereby suggesting that these 2 residues may be important for its enzyme activity. We directly tested this hypothesis by substituting Tyr-236 with Phe and Lys-154 with Glu in rabbit testicular ACE (ACET) using site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding cDNA. Wild type ACET, the two single mutants, and the double mutant were expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus-T7 polymerase expression system. The rate of synthesis, post-translational modifications, and cleavage secretion pattern of all four proteins were indistinguishable. The enzymatic properties of the two single mutants and the wild type enzyme were also very similar. In contrast, the double mutant had about a 20-fold lower specific activity although its Km was only 6-fold higher than that of the wild type protein. The double mutant also had a 100-fold higher Ki for lisinopril, a competitive inhibitor of ACET, and was 17-fold less sensitive to stimulation by NaCl, an activator of ACET. These results directly demonstrate that Tyr-236 and Lys-154 are indeed critical for the catalytic activity, lisinopril inhibition, and NaCl activation of ACET.",

Responsiveness to each drug i.e. blood pressure reduction per unit drug concentration was not significantly altered in the combination regimen. In conclusion, these results suggest that the combination of enalapril and doxazosin produces a usefully additive hypotensive effect but there was no evidence of synergism i.e an effect which was more than additive.",

Both drugs caused a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure after three months' treatment, but only cilazapril reduced it after the first dose. Heart rate was reduced only by atenolol (61 +/- 3 vs 71 +/- 3 bpm; p < 0.01). Changes in forearm compliance and characteristic impedance showed a difference statistically significant both for acute test and after three months of treatment. The increase in blood pressure during handgrip did not differ appreciably between the two treatment groups.

    "371": "The possible role of the endogenous kinins in the control of alcohol intake was assessed in two experiments. In Experiment 1, naive rats, maintained on ad lib food and water, were given daily 40-min access to a 6% (w/v) alcohol solution and water. Daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of captopril (20 mg/kg) significantly reduced alcohol intake, while pretreatment with subcutaneous (SC) injections of the bradykinin antagonist [D-Phe7]-bradykinin (100-300 micrograms/kg) attenuated the suppressive effect of captopril on alcohol intake. The saline vehicle or the bradykinin antagonist alone did not alter alcohol intake. In Experiment 2, bradykinin was administered daily at 100, 200, and 400 micrograms/kg doses SC either alone or in combination with captopril 10 mg/kg IP. Neither bradykinin nor captopril by themselves changed alcohol or water intake. Bradykinin combined with captopril stimulated water intake and reduced alcohol intake by up to 70%. This effect was not due to drug-induced changes in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist [Sar1,Thr8]-angiotensin II at 250 and 500 micrograms/kg SC attenuated the stimulation of water intake but not the reduction in alcohol intake. It is suggested that by inhibiting kininase II, ACE inhibitors extend the duration of action of bradykinin and thereby unmask a potent inhibition of alcohol intake mediated by kinins--an effect that is dissociable from the accompanying stimulation of water intake. Taken together, these results point to an involvement of the kinin system in the regulation of alcohol intake and in particular to a role of bradykinin in the suppressive effect of ACE inhibitors on alcohol intake.",

    "381": "Besides the long-term regulation of extracellular fluid volume, the RAS plays an important physiologic role in maintaining venous return and blood pressure during acute hemodynamic stresses. ACE inhibitors may therefore alter venous return and cardiac output regulation during anesthesia and surgery. This may be regarded as a drawback of ACE inhibition when other factors interfere with cardiovascular homeostasis; deleterious hemodynamic events may therefore occur when blood volume is decreased, which may be frequent during cardiovascular anesthesia and surgery. However, the alternative solution should not be to stop ACE inhibitors preoperatively. This would allow recovery of RAS control of blood pressure, but at the expense of some regional circulations. From this point of view, preliminary results from early studies during cardiovascular anesthesia and surgery showing redistribution of regional blood flow with inhibition of ACE are encouraging; whether postoperative outcome can be improved deserves further studies. At this time, the evidence is that ACE inhibition does not allow the anesthesiologist to be tolerant of hypovolemia.", 
    "382": "Gelatinases are metalloproteinases in the kidney which can cleave type IV collagen as well as gelatin. We partially purified the 72 kDa and 92 kDa gelatinases. The gelatinolytic activity was measured by zymography and a quantitative biotin-avidin assay. By zymography, captopril in concentrations of 20 mM and 40 mM added to the incubation buffer reduced the gelatinolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of zinc in a concentration of 50 to 100 microM reversed most of the inhibitory effect of captopril. By the biotin-avidin assay, captopril in a concentration of 30 to 50 nM reduced half of either the 72 kDa or 92 kDa gelatinolytic activity. Zinc in a concentration of 50 microM completely reversed the inhibitory effect of 1 microM captopril on both gelatinases. Lisinopril, a non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, similarly inhibited the gelatinases, but a 100-fold higher concentration of the drug was needed. These findings suggest that captopril reversibly inhibits the 72 kDa and 92 kDa metalloproteinases by interacting with the zinc ion at their active sites. This inhibitory effect is observed with captopril levels comparable to the concentrations needed to inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme in vivo and may at least partially explain some of the renoprotective effects seen with this drug.", 
    "383": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is present in cultured bovine bronchial epithelial cells (BBECs) and whether its activity can be modulated. We found that extracts of confluent monolayers of cultured BBECs degraded [glycine-1-14C]hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine at a rate of 843 +/- 66 pmol/hr/mg protein (mean +/- SEM, n = 5). In addition, we found that the enzyme was shed into the culture medium. ACE activity in BBECs was inhibited by three selective, but structurally different, ACE inhibitors (captopril, quinapril, and cisalaprilat) with an IC50 of approximately 2 nM. Increasing chloride concentration in the assay buffer resulted in an increase in BBECs ACE activity of 63%. Enzyme activity was also modulated by the presence of zinc cation in the assay buffer. Addition of dexamethasone to the culture medium was associated with a significant increase in BBECs ACE activity (P < 0.05), which was inhibited by the steroid receptor antagonist RU 38486. Western blot analysis of BBECs, tracheal and bronchial mucosal strips utilizing a cross-reacting rabbit anti-mouse ACE antibody, showed a faint 175 kDa band and additional strong 52 kDa and 47 kDa band. The mechanism of generation of the low M.W. bands is unknown. Our data indicate the presence of ACE in cultured BBECs and that enzyme activity can be modulated.",

Using the radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-MAG3, 54 kidneys with angiographically verified renal artery status were evaluated with respect to the following scintigraphic parameters: intraparenchymal tracer transport, urine drainage, kidney size, and functional side-to-side ratio. In cases of decompensated renal artery stenosis, the typical scan finding using MAG3 was shown to be a distinct parenchymal nuclide retention in combination with a delayed appearance of the radiotracer in the pelvic system. In our patients, the visual impression of the renal sequential scans was superior to quantitative evaluation methods. Using these criteria in 43 patients with suspected renovascular hypertension, sensitivity and specificity were 89% and 88%, respectively. Bilateral positive findings were nonspecific; when excluding them from the study, specificity increased to 100%.",

It was also determined if the intrarenal angiotensin II (ANG II) effects during ECVE are potentiated by the inhibition of PG synthesis. ECVE induced similar elevations of RIHP, natriuresis, and fractional lithium excretion in dogs treated (n = 7) and not treated with a PG synthesis inhibitor (n = 5). In other experimental groups, the effects of the intrarenal maintenance of ANG II levels (n = 6) by infusing captopril and ANG II into the right renal artery were compared with those induced by the simultaneous infusion of captopril, ANG II, and a PG synthesis inhibitor (n = 6). In response to ECVE, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were similar in both kidneys when ANG II levels were maintained constant and were significantly higher in the left kidney when ANG II levels were maintained constant and PG synthesis was inhibited in the right kidney. However, when compared with the left kidney, the ECVE-induced increments of natriuresis and RIHP in the right kidney were reduced by the same magnitude when intrarenal ANG II was maintained constant with (36 and 53%, respectively) and without (40 and 54%, respectively) the simultaneous PG synthesis inhibition. Our results indicate that during ECVE, renal PGs do not play an important role in mediating the RIHP-induced increments in natriuresis and decrements in proximal sodium reabsorption.

Chest X-ray film, echocardiography (echo), X-ray computed tomography (CT) and RA before and after about 6 months of E administration were studied. The LV mass was calculated by CT. The LV function was measured by echo. RAS was unchanged during this study. LV mass was significantly reduced after E (121.4 +/- 25.6 vs 104.6 +/- 13.7 g/cm2). The LV systolic function was unchanged after E, but LV diastolic function improved. It was shown that the long-term administration of E improves LV hypertrophy and LV diastolic function without any change of RAS.",

In a previous study in a syngeneic rat BMT model it was shown that captopril (an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme) could be used to treat experimental BMT nephropathy. Current studies were designed to determine whether captopril could also be used to prevent BMT nephropathy. Rats received 14 to 18.5 Gy TBI in six fractions over 3 days followed by syngeneic BMT. Seven days before TBI half the rats were started on captopril (500 mg/liter in the drinking water). Blood urea nitrogen, ratios of urine protein to creatinine, serum creatinine, and blood pressure were used to assess renal function. In animals receiving TBI alone, BMT nephropathy developed 3 to 6 months after transplant. At 6 months after TBI, captopril-treated animals had lower systolic blood pressure and better-preserved renal function than animals receiving TBI alone, with dose-modifying factors of about 1.3. The captopril treatment had no effect on bone marrow ablation by TBI. Captopril appears to be safe and effective in the prophylaxis of BMT nephropathy.",

In carotid arteries isolated from SHR and WKY, the magnitude of [14C]CGS 16617 uptake was slightly greater than the [14C]sucrose uptake (the extracellular space), and the percentages of [14C]CGS 16617 and [14C]sucrose in fast and slow desaturation components were similar. Addition of high concentrations of nonradioactive CGS 16617 (10(-5)M during uptakes or washouts of [14C]CGS 16617 did not change uptake amounts or efflux rates. The dose-response curves of contractions obtained with ANG I or ANG II as well as the dose-dependent inhibition of ANG I-induced responses in the presence of CGS 16617 were similar for carotids taken from both WKY and SHR. Responses to ANG I were restored as early as 5 min after incubation solutions containing inhibitory concentrations of CGS 16617 were removed. Similarly, normal responsiveness to the contractile effects of ANG I were observed with carotid arteries removed from SHR with decreased blood pressure and plasma ACE activity after 5 weeks exposure to CGS 16617. In contrast, however, responses to norepinephrine were decreased in carotid arteries obtained from CGS 16617-treated SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The optimal pH was shown to be 6.5. The bivalent cation chelating agent, 1,10-phenanthroline protected [Leu]enkephalin from degradation, suggesting that this enzyme is a metallopeptidase. The degradation of [Leu]enkephalin was also abolished by the neutral endopeptidase-24.11 inhibitors RB104 (2-[(3-iodo-4-hydroxyl)-phenylmethyl]-4-N-[3-(hydroxyamino-3-oxo-1- phenylmethyl)-propyl]amino-4-oxobutanoic acid), HABCO-Gly [(3-hydroxy-aminocarbonyl-2-benzyl-1-oxypropyl)glycine], phosphoramidon and thiorphan, with IC50 values of 1 nM, 1 microM, 20 microM and 30 microM respectively. By contrast, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and the serine proteinase inhibitor phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride were without effect. Phase separation experiments using Triton X-114 showed that about 64% of the neutral endopeptidase activity in the Aplysia kidney membrane corresponds to an integral membrane protein. A specific radioiodinated inhibitor ([125I]RB104) was shown to bind the Aplysia endopeptidase with high affinity; the KD and Bmax. values were 21 +/- 5 pM and 20.3 +/- 5 fmol/mg of proteins respectively. This inhibitor was used to determine the molecular form of the enzyme, after separation of solubilized membrane proteins on SDS/PAGE and transfer on to nitrocellulose membranes. A single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa was observed. The labelling was abolished by specific neutral endopeptidase inhibitors.

    "398": "The effects of extracellular matrix proteins and mechanical strain on the mitogenic activity of angiotensins I and II (AI and AII) were examined in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells. VSM cells on various extracellular matrices were exposed to AII (1 microM) for 48 h. On plastic, AII induced only a 1.6-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation, but on fibronectin- or type I collagen-coated plastic, the response to AII was enhanced from two- to fourfold. On a type I collagen-coated silicone elastomer, to which mechanical strain was applied, [3H]thymidine incorporation dramatically increased to a maximum of 53-fold. Dup 753 (10(-5) M) blocked the AII-induced increase in DNA synthesis. AI also increased DNA synthesis in VSM cells, and this response was also enhanced by mechanical strain. Mitogenic activity of AI was blocked by ramiprilat (10(-5) M), indicating that its mitogenic activity was via conversion to AII. The synergy between AII and strain was completely eliminated by neutralizing antibodies to PDGF AB (3 micrograms/ml). Furthermore, the mitogenic effect of AII in unstrained cells was also synergistic with submaximal concentrations of PDGF AB (1 ng/ml). Thus, the synergy between AII and mechanical strain probably results from synergism between AII and PDGF secreted in response to strain.", 
    "399": "The present study was designed to determine whether bradykinin induces endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle in human coronary arteries, and if so, to define the contribution of this hyperpolarization to endothelium-dependent relaxations. The membrane potential of arterial smooth muscle cells (measured by glass microelectrodes) and changes in isometric force were recorded in tissues from six patients undergoing heart transplantation. In the presence of indomethacin and NG-nitro-L-arginine (NLA), the membrane potential was -48.3 +/- 0.6 and -46.9 +/- 0.6 mV, in preparations with and without endothelium, respectively, and was not affected by treatment with perindoprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In the presence of both indomethacin and NLA, bradykinin evoked transient and concentration-dependent hyperpolarizations only in tissues with endothelium, which were augmented by perindoprilat and mimicked by the calcium ionophore A23187. Glibenclamide did not inhibit membrane hyperpolarization to bradykinin. In rings contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, the cumulative addition of bradykinin caused a concentration-dependent relaxation during contractions evoked by prostaglandin F2 alpha, which was not abolished by NLA and indomethacin. The present findings demonstrate the occurrence of endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization, and its contribution to endothelium-dependent relaxations, in the human coronary artery.", 
    "400": "We evaluated exercise performance in 14 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension 1 h after the administration of a single dose of placebo, nifedipine (20 mg), captopril (50 mg), and propranolol (80 mg). Drugs were administered at the same time of day following a randomized, double-blind protocol. Mean resting blood pressure (+/- SE) was 135 +/- 3 mm Hg with placebo administration, 118 +/- 4 with captopril, 110 +/- 4 with nifedipine, and 115 +/- 5 with propranolol and increased with exercise to 163 +/- 4, 146 +/- 3, 136 +/- 4, 136 +/- 4, respectively. Oxygen consumption at peak exercise and at ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) was 25.2 +/- 1.1 and 18.1 +/- 1.0 ml/min/kg with placebo. Only propranolol (-2.3 ml/min/kg) decreased peak exercise oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption at VAT was reduced by nifedipine and propranolol but unaffected by captopril. The effects on exercise capacity of blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients are dependent on the drug utilized and are not related to the amount of blood pressure reduction. The lowered oxygen consumption at VAT observed with nifedipine and propranolol, and not with captopril, might be due to an excessive downward shift of the muscle perfusion pressure--oxygen consumption relationship which might take place during exercise.", 
    "401": "Reductions in serum potassium influence myocardial cell excitability by increasing membrane potential, diastolic depolarization, duration of refractory period and action potential, and decreasing conduction velocity. Disturbances in electrolyte balance typically involve alterations in two or more cations whose effects can be additive or antagonist. Serum magnesium and calcium have been demonstrated to influence the electrophysiologic effects of potassium imbalances. The arrhythmogenic potential of hypokalemia is thought to result from electrical inhomogeneity, alterations in conduction, changes in automaticity and disturbances in sodium pump kinetics. Potassium balance is maintained by two separate, yet interrelated, systems: distribution and the balance between intake and excretion. Cell wall integrity, osmolality, hormones and acid-base balance influence the relative concentrations of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. Renal excretion is the major route of elimination and is affected by acid-base balance, potassium and sodium intake, urinary flow rates and mineralocorticoid states. Serum potassium is not an accurate reflection of total body potassium stores. Acute hypokalemia differs from chronic, for the former results in a change in only the serum potassium concentration, whereas the latter is accompanied by a reduction in both the total body stores and serum levels. The importance of intracellular and extracellular concentrations lies in their determination of the resting membrane potential and, therefore, membrane excitability. Although experimental studies have demonstrated an association between ventricular ectopy and hypokalemia, the clinical studies to date have reported conflicting results. The arrhythmogenic role of hypokalemia has been examined in ambulatory hypertensive patients with acute myocardial infarctions and those with magnesium deficiencies, the results of which have been difficult to interpret because of differences in study design, durations, and characteristics of study population. During general anesthesia, both experimental and clinical studies have failed to demonstrate an increase in the incidence of ventricular ectopy in hypokalemic patients. The common practice of acute repletion therapy or cancellation is not warranted based on the studies to date. Repletion therapy is neither inexpensive nor benign. In one study of 4921 hospitalized patients, the frequency of dangerous complications of oral and/or intravenous potassium therapy was approximately 1 in 175. Certain patients are susceptible to hyperkalemia, so commonly prescribed medication can promote elevations in serum potassium including indomethacin, amiloride, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Evaluation of hypokalemia should include identification of the etiology precipitating the electrolyte imbalance. Examinations should include the duration and severity of the depletion, history of past and present illness, current medications, and the presence of concurrent electrolyte disturbances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "402": "A procedure for the collection, processing, extraction, separation, and measurement of renal tissue angiotensin II [ANG-(1-8)] is described. The arterial plasma and renal tissue concentrations of ANG-(1-8) were examined in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley male rats (10 to 12 weeks of age) given an intravenous saline infusion (group 1; n = 6), an intravenous bolus infusion of 0.5 microgram angiotensin I (group 2; n = 6), or an intravenous bolus of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (group 3; n = 6). Plasma and renal tissue were collected at the peak mean arterial pressure (MAP) response. The mean (+/- SEM) concentration of ANG-(1-8) in the group given the saline vehicle was 12 +/- 2 fmol/mL in the plasma and 2.4 +/- 0.3 pmol/g in the renal tissue. The angiotensin I bolus significantly increased MAP by 40%. Following the angiotensin I infusion, at the time of peak MAP response, the concentration of the circulating and renal tissue ANG-(1-8) were 12-fold and twofold higher, respectively, compared with the saline vehicle. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor significantly decreased MAP by 10% and decreased the circulating and renal tissue ANG-(1-8) levels by 75% and 62.5%, respectively, compared with the saline vehicle. The rapid conversion of exogenous angiotensin I to ANG-(1-8) in renal tissue provides direct evidence that renal tissue can generate de novo ANG-(1-8) from a circulating precursor. Furthermore, plasma and renal tissue respond similarly to acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "403": "Studies of conscious, chronically catheterized, young (3 to 5 months of age) and old (19 to 22 months of age) male Sprague Dawley rats in the baseline state showed that glomerular filtration rate (factored for body weight) was lower and urine flow higher in old compared with young rats. Acute blockade of endogenous angiotensin II (AII) with either converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) or Losartan (Dupont Merck, Wilmington, DE) caused small variable decreases in blood pressure in both age groups and produced a significant renal vasodilation with increases in renal plasma flow in the older rats. In separate studies using low-dose AII infusion (5 ng/kg body weight/min), an increase in filtration fraction was the only effect seen in both young and old rats with an intact renin/AII system; no effect was seen with CEI. During high-dose AII (20 ng/kg body weight/min), significant and similar increases were seen in blood pressure and renal vascular resistance in old and young rats, and the patterns of blood pressure and renal hemodynamic responses were similar with and without acute CEI. A natriuretic and diuretic response to high-dose AII was seen in young rats with intact endogenous renin/AII, whereas old rats were completely refractory to this action of AII. Against a background of acute CEI, no natriuretic/diuretic response to high-dose AII was seen in either age group. Thus, in the baseline state, renal hemodynamics in the old kidney are controlled by endogenous AII since CEI and Losartan produce renal vasodilation in old but not young rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "405": "Although botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) types A and B and tetanus toxin (TeTx) are specific inhibitors of transmitter release whose light chains contain a zinc-binding motif characteristic of metalloendoproteases, only the latter two proteolyse synaptobrevin. Chelation of zinc or its readdition at high concentration hindered blockade of neuromuscular transmission by BoNT/A and B, indicating that type A also acts via a zinc-dependent mechanism. Such treatments prevented proteolysis of synaptobrevin II in rat brain synaptic vesicles by BoNT/B and TeTx but only the activity of the latter was antagonised appreciably by ASQFETS, a peptide spanning their cleavage site. The toxin's neuroparalytic activities were attenuated by phosphoramidon or captopril, inhibitors of certain zinc requiring proteases. However, these agents were ineffective in reducing the toxins' degradation of synaptobrevin except that a high concentration of captopril partially blocked the activity of TeTx but not BoNT/B, as also found for these drugs when tested on synaptosomal noradrenaline release. These various criteria establish that a zinc-dependent protease activity underlies the neurotoxicity of BoNT/A, a finding confirmed at motor nerve endings for type B and TeTx. Moreover, the low potencies of captopril and phosphoramidon in counteracting the toxins' effects necessitate the design of improved inhibitors for possible use in the clinical treatment of tetanus or botulism.", 
    "406": "Previous studies have shown some distinct hemodynamic alterations in essential hypertension, including increased resistance, wave reflections, and pulse wave velocity and decreased systemic compliance. These abnormalities are completely normalized by nonspecific smooth muscle dilation with nitroprusside but not by combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. The renin-angiotensin system, acting possibly via both circulating and local tissue effects, is thought to play an important role in essential hypertension, so its role in the altered hemodynamics deserves careful investigation. A hypertensive patient group was compared with a normotensive group similar in age, body size, and proportion of men and women. During diagnostic cardiac catheterization, ascending aortic micromanometer pressures and electromagnetic flows were measured in the baseline state. Intravenous captopril of a sufficient dosage (11 mg) to normalize blood pressure then was given to the hypertensive patients while measurements were repeated. From the pressures and flows, aortic input impedance, wave reflection magnitude, and compliance were computed. In the hypertensive group, the important hemodynamic alterations consisted of increased peripheral resistance, first zero crossing of aortic impedance phase angle, and wave reflections and decreased systemic compliance. Captopril had a pronounced hemodynamic effect. It normalized blood pressure, resistance, and impedance phase angle zero crossing. Compliance, although increased substantially by captopril, was still slightly lower than normotensive levels. The magnitude of wave reflections, although substantially lowered by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, was still persistently greater than normal. The present results, together with those previously reported, demonstrate that a complex interplay of factors underlies the increased smooth muscle tone in essential hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "407": "The effects of captopril on the response of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells of aortas from Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats to angiotensin II (Ang II) and bradykinin were studied using fura 2. Incubation with captopril for longer than 10 minutes caused a decreased response of cytosolic free Ca2+ to Ang II and bradykinin. Maximal effects of captopril were observed after a 40-minute incubation. The inhibitory effect of captopril was abolished in Ca(2+)-free medium, suggesting that captopril acts by blocking Ca2+ influx. Similar effects were observed with enalaprilat. Isometric contraction of aortic strips induced by Ang II in normotensive rats was reduced from 6.5 +/- 2.5 to 1.8 +/- 0.6 mN by a 40-minute incubation with 1 mumol/L captopril (P = .016). Enalaprilat similarly decreased the Ang II-induced contraction.

The aim of this study was to assess the aortic distensibility in a group of 10 patients with essential hypertension in comparison with a control group, with regard to the vascular effects of a long-term anti-hypertensive treatment with calcium-antagonists and ACE-inhibitors. All patients were studied using cine-MR imaging, a technique with several peculiarities (multiplanar scanning, intrinsic contrast, etc) that allows simple and quick assessment of the aortic vascular parameters in the ascending and descending tracts. The results of our study show the absence of a significant improvement of aortic vascular areas, and therefore of vessel distensibility, even in the presence of a complete blood pressure normalization in all patients after a 3-month treatment. These data do not confirm previous reports in this setting, based on the ultrasonographic techniques (2D and Doppler echocardiography). Two major reasons may explain our results: first, the rigorous criteria of patient enrollment that we have stated in order to avoid any influence of age and/or other pathologies; second, the ability of MR imaging to allow accurate estimation of aortic vascular parameters and to achieve an excellent intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility in comparison with other techniques.

Rat groups received either spirapril (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg/day, administered throughout the study in the food), cilazapril (10 mg/kg/day) or placebo. Spirapril caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the neointimal thickening of the rat carotid artery. The degree of inhibition with 10 mg/kg/d spirapril and cilazapril was similar (-44% and -42% respectively). The carotid lumen area was measured in vivo by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging both before and 2 weeks after balloon injury and also postmortem by histological techniques. Two weeks after injury, the lumen area of the left carotid artery was significantly reduced following balloon injury, as measured by both techniques. Treatment did not detectably modify this stenosis process despite the use of two independent methods for assessing lumen size, even though neointimal thickening was strongly attenuated by both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. This dissociation between inhibition of neointimal lesion development and decrease of lumen size provides a new view of the role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in vascular damage situations. Our results suggest that the focus, particularly in clinical studies, on lumen size, may mean that potentially beneficial effects of these drugs on other parts of the vascular wall be overlooked.", 
    "415": "The effects of spirapril and isradipine on blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion and sodium-volume homeostasis in hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with nephropathy were assessed. Fifteen Type 1 diabetic patients aged 28-53 years with a diabetes duration of 19-37 years were studied. All had hypertension and diabetic nephropathy with a urinary albumin excretion of more than 300 mg/24 h. After a single blind placebo treatment period of 4 weeks the patients were randomly assigned to treatment with the calcium antagonist isradipine SRO 5 mg once daily or the ACE inhibitor spirapril 6 mg once daily for 6 months in a double-blind design. Isradipine lowered ambulatory systolic blood pressure from 152 +/- 12 to 141 +/- 11 mmHg (p < 0.05) and ambulatory diastolic pressure from 91 +/- 9 to 86 +/- 8 mmHg (p < 0.05). The blood pressure lowering effect of spirapril was similar: 156 +/- 13 vs 143 +/- 11 mmHg (p < 0.01) and 90 +/- 4 vs 84 +/- 4 mmHg (p < 0.05). The fractional albumin clearance was unchanged on isradipine but decreased after 6 months treatment with spirapril with on average 20% (p < 0.05). Total body exchangeable sodium decreased on spirapril treatment: 2994 +/- 296 vs 2636 +/- 194 meq/1.73 m2 (p < 0.05) and extracellular volume tended to do so (p = 0.12). On isradipine treatment these parameters remained unchanged. In conclusion both isradipine and spirapril lowered blood pressure in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Only the ACE inhibitor had demonstrable beneficial effects on urinary albumin excretion rate and the sodium-volume expansion seen in these patients.",

Probably as a result of sympathetic activation, average daily heart rate was higher after dihydralazine on low (72.9 +/- 2.9 b/min) and high salt intake (72.4 +/- 2.8 b/min) than after cilazapril on either salt intake (68.7 +/- 3.1 and 62.7 +/- 3.2 b/min).",

In contrast, vasodilators of the dihydralazine type have similar antihypertensive effects on low and high salt intake. To the extent that the findings of this short-term study can be extrapolated to long-term effects they suggest that intrarenal mechanisms, i.e. resetting of the pressure-natriuresis relationship, are involved in the long-term antihypertensive action of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "420": "Effects of calcium antagonists on pressor mechanisms: A number of differences have been reported in the variable extent to which calcium antagonists interfere with various pressor mechanisms. In theory, high lipid solubility, membrane-binding characteristics and a prolonged duration of action appear to be requirements for a calcium antagonist to affect mechanisms such as vasodilation, endogenous vasoconstrictor responses, hormone release and natriuretic activity. Reduction in peripheral vascular resistance: A reduction in peripheral vascular resistance is fundamental to the antihypertensive effect not only of calcium antagonists but also of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists. However, only the calcium antagonists interfere directly with the pressor responses mediated by both the adrenergic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system. Mechanism of lacidipine effects: Preliminary results with the new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist lacidipine indicate that it not only has vasodilator activity but that it also interferes with both adrenergic and non-adrenergic endogenous vasoconstrictor mechanisms. This may provide additional potentially beneficial cardiovascular effects, particularly in relation to left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction.",

    "425": "The effect of captopril cardioplegia on ischemic and reperfusion myocardium after 3 hours of hypothermic (13 +/- 1 C) arrest and 35 minutes of reperfusion was studied in the isolated working rabbit heart. In comparison with the control group, captopril cardioplegia reduced the content of angiotensin II (381 +/- 56 vs 507 +/- 84 pg/g wt of the control group, P < 0.01) and MDA (50.0 +/- 9.2 vs 85.1 +/- 16.1 pmol/mg pr, P < 0.01) in the reperfusion myocardium; augmented the renin activity of ischemic (1050 +/- 353 vs 669 +/- 301 pg/g wt/h, P < 0.05) and reperfusion myocardium (1261 +/- 421 vs 498 +/- 353 pg/g wt/h, P < 0.01) increased the 6-K-PGF1 alpha/TXB2 ratio in the reperfusion myocardium (by 48.1% of the control group). Meanwhile, captopril cardioplegia could also decrease the content of calcium (0.027 +/- 0.015 vs 0.045 +/- 0.014 microM/mg pr, P < 0.05) and sodium (0.54 +/- 0.26 vs 0.82 +/- 0.15 microM/mg pr, P < 0.05) in the reperfusion myocardium, but had no effect on the potassium content. The results show that the protective effect of captopril on hypothermic myocardium may be related to the free radical scavenging action, inhibition of angiotensin II production, improvement of PGI2/TXA2 ratio and decrease of calcium and sodium overload in the myocardium.",

The veno-arterial gradient (VA-gradient) of erythropoietin (EPO), haemoglobin oxygen saturation and plasma renin activity (PRA) was determined separately in each kidney before and 1 h after angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-inhibition). The VA-gradient of EPO and of hemoglobin oxygen saturation were the same in the affected and unaffected kidney during basal conditions. During ACE-inhibition the VA-gradient of EPO disappeared on the affected side but not on the unaffected side. A fall in s-EPO after ACE inhibition was demonstrated in the renal vein on the affected side (-1.4 U l-1, p < 0.01), in the contralateral vein (-0.8 U l-1, p < 0.01) and in the aorta (-0.6 U l-1, p < 0.01). The O2-gradients were reduced on both sides after captopril, from 10.8-7.5% (p < 0.04) on the affected side and from 10.8-9.0% (p < 0.04) on the contralateral.

It has been well documented that angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors act beneficially in chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). In the present study, renal and hormonal effects of SCH 34826, an orally active NEP inhibitor, were studied in a coronary-ligation model of experimental CHF in the rat. The effects were compared to those of captopril. The drugs were also administered in combination. In anaesthetized rats with CHF, SCH 34826 (90 mg kg-1 sc) elevated plasma ANP from 382 +/- 85 to 658 +/- 120 ng l-1 compared with vehicle (p = 0.002). In sham-operated control rats, plasma ANP also increased slightly from 52 +/- 6 to 70 +/- 9 ng l-1 (p = 0.05). Plasma renin activity did not change in either group. When given orally for 36 h (90 mg kg-1 b.i.d.), SCH 34826 enhanced natriuresis in controls but not in rats with CHF. Captopril (0.2 mg ml-1 in drinking water) enhanced natriuresis in CHF rats and both natriuresis and kaliuresis in controls. When SCH 34826 and captopril were combined, natriuresis was potentiated in control rats as compared with captopril alone; in rats with CHF, however, a brisk kaliuresis was seen. The excretion of cyclic guanosine monophosphate was enhanced in CHF rats by 52% during treatment with SCH 34826 but not with captopril or combination of the two drugs. Moreover, captopril suppressed aldosterone excretion both in CHF rats and controls when administered alone but not when combined with SCH 34826.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "433": "We investigated the potency of various serotypes of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by examining LPS-induced stimulation of PGI2 production and suppression of ACE activity in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC which had been incubated with E. coli 055:B5 and 0111:B4 for 24 h produced more prostacyclin (PGI2) in response to thrombin than HUVEC incubated with E. coli 026:B6. Also, angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACE) in cell lysates of HUVEC incubated for 24 h with 055:B5 or 0111:B4 was suppressed significantly compared to control HUVEC or HUVEC incubated with 026:B6. From these experimental results, E. coli 055:B5 and 0111:B4 appear to be more potent than 026:B6. It is concluded that this difference in potency among various serotypes of LPS should be taken into account when experiments are designed to examine the effect of LPS on endothelial cell function.", 
    "434": "One of the functions of the sympathetic nervous system is to produce a short-term increase in blood pressure. It might be thought, therefore, that antihypertensive drugs which interfere with the functioning of the sympathetic nervous system (e.g. betablockers) would reduce blood pressure variability over 24 h whereas those that act independently of it (e.g. ACE inhibitors) would not. Two groups of 10 hypertensives underwent noninvasive 24-h blood pressure monitoring before and after antihypertensive treatment with a betablocker (atenolol) and an ACE inhibitor (benazepril) respectively. Blood pressure variability was measured by the variability coefficient (standard deviation/mean). Atenolol induced a non-statistically significant decrease in blood pressure variability, whereas benazepril caused a statistically significant increase in systolic blood pressure variability. Therefore, we conclude that the evaluation of ACE-inhibitor therapeutic effect on blood pressure by the \"casual\" measurement can be misleading in judging the efficacy of such drugs.", 
    "435": "In the present study, using the technique of EPR spin trapping with DMPO a spin trap, we demonstrated formation of thiyl radicals from thiol-containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (CAP) and from its stereoisomer epicaptopril (EPICAP), a non-ACE inhibitor, in the process of .OH radical scavenging. Splitting constants of DMPO/thiyl radical adducts were identical for both thiols and were aN = 15.3 G, and aH = 16.2 G. Bimolecular rate constants for the reaction of CAP and EPICAP with .OH radicals were close to a diffusion-controlled rate (approximately 2 x 10(10) M-1s-1). Our data also show that both CAP and EPICAP reduce Fe(III) ions and that their respective thiyl radicals are formed in this reaction. In the presence of Fe(III), H2O2, and CAP, or EPICAP, .OH radicals were produced by a thiol-driven Fenton mechanism. Copper(II) ions were also reduced by these thiols, but no thiyl radicals could be detected in these reactions, and no .OH or other Fenton oxidants were observed in the presence of H2O2. Our data show direct evidence that thiol groups of CAP and EPICAP are involved in scavenging of .OH radicals. The direct .OH radical scavenging, together with the reductive \"repair\" of other sites of .OH radical attack, may contribute to the known protective effect of CAP against ischemia/reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. The formation of reactive thiyl radicals in the reactions of the studied compounds with .OH radicals and with Fe(III) ions may play a role in some of the known adverse effects of CAP.",

    "437": "Ten age-matched beagle dogs were kept on a high-fat diet and followed for 12 weeks. During this period the animals were divided into two groups (n = 5), either with or without oral captopril treatment. Dogs were tested periodically for biochemical and clinical parameters, and at the end of the study animals were killed and thoracic aorta samples were obtained for histologic evaluation. From the third week, the captopril group presented significantly lower values of mean arterial pressure, plasma norepinephrine, and fasting glucose and cholesterol levels than those attained in the nontreated group. Furthermore, aorta samples from untreated animals showed profuse staining for fat content at the intima and adventitia layers, while this reaction was restricted to the outer layer in treated dogs. These data suggest that the beneficial effects of captopril therapy in this obesity-induced hypertension model could be based on blood pressure control, together with reduction of serum glucose, cholesterol, and sympathetic activity levels. In addition, captopril treatment could play a role in the retardation of the early stages of vascular atherogenetic lesion.",

Left ventricular dysfunction is among the major risk factors for such adverse events. Although reductions in cardiovascular risk have been achieved by use of aspirin, beta-blockers (and sometimes revascularization and/or serum lipid-lowering agents), the potential of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve the outcome for survivors of myocardial infarction has only recently been examined. The concept that ACE inhibition might be of benefit for these patients originated from animal studies demonstrating that long-term ACE inhibition therapy attenuated left-ventricular enlargement.

This sequence in the pathophysiology has been shown to be blunted by ACE inhibitors. Volume increase, however, can also be helpful in restoring stroke volume and ameliorate elevation of filling pressures. Furthermore, very early institution of ACE inhibition has failed to improve short-term mortality after myocardial infarction in one large trial. The aim of the ECCE trial therefore is, to investigate the early effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril on compromise of exercise capacity, thought to be a first measurable sign of developing heart failure. The ECCE trial is a randomized, seven-center investigation, studying the effects of ACE inhibition on oxygen uptake in a double blind, placebo controlled design in a group of 204 patients. Sample size was calculated on the basis of a pilot trial. The study design and first not unblinded data of 104 patients are presented. The population consists of predominantly male patients with mostly first myocardial infarction. They were admitted to hospital within five hours of onset of chest pain. End-diastolic volumes were normal, but ejection fraction was moderately compromised. ACE inhibition was started after the first day, but within 72 hours of onset of chest pain. After four and after twelve weeks, oxygen uptake was considerably below expected values and one third of the patients had severe compromise of exercise capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "449": "The adjunctive use of ACE-inhibitors with thrombolytic therapy early during acute myocardial infarction offers theoretic advantages. In the acute phase, captopril may scavenge free radicals, blunt the catecholamine response, elicit coronary vasodilation and increase prostacyclin and bradykinin levels. In the chronic phase remodelling may be attenuated. At present, a large number of controlled clinical trials mainly focussing on the effects of ACE-inhibition in the chronic phase is under way. Only few studies concentrate on the effect of acute intervention with ACE-inhibitors in ischemia-reperfusion i.e. thrombolysis in myocardial infarction. In the Captopril And Thrombolysis pilot study (CAT pilot-study) 3 mg and 6.25 mg captopril was tolerated well as adjunctive therapy to intravenous streptokinase. Decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (36 +/- 11%) after 6.25 mg was comparable to the control group (30 +/- 7%). Furthermore noradrenaline levels decreased dose dependently to 47 +/- 6 and 38 +/- 7% from baseline respectively. These results prompted a large nationwide acute intervention trial with captopril in 300 patients receiving thrombolytic therapy: the Captopril And Thrombolysis Study (CATS). The primary hypothesis of CATS supposes a very early effect of converting enzyme inhibition on evolving myocardial damage due to ischemia and the consequences of early reperfusion. This will be evaluated by serial echocardiography, Holter monitoring and neurohumoral measurements immediately upon thrombolysis and during the first year after myocardial infarction. Blinded data show a favourable blood pressure response, with systolic hypotension below 100 mm Hg occurring only in 0.2% of patients.", 
    "450": "In patients with chronic heart failure, exercise capacity and clinical symptoms correlate poorly, if at all with the degree of left ventricular dysfunction. These observations might indicate that peripheral alterations (e.g. reduced perfusion of the exercising muscle) contribute to the functional state and exercise capacity of patients with chronic heart failure. Acute improvements in hemodynamics by means of therapy with vasodilators or positive inotropes, however, could not be translated into an enhanced oxygen consumption. These studies have prompted the hypothesis that in the setting of heart failure, intrinsic abnormalities of the exercising muscle develop that prevent acute improvement in peak VO2. Indeed, ultrastructural analysis of a large cohort of patients with chronic heart failure revealed that volume density of mitochondria and surface density of mitochondrial cristae (both are parameters for the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle) were reduced by more than 20% as compared to healthy control subjects. In contrast to left ventricular contractility parameters, ultrastructural changes of the skeletal muscle correlated closely with peak oxygen consumption, indicating that abnormalities of the exercising muscle contribute to a decreased exercise capacity in this patient group. Chronic but not acute treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors increases blood flow to the exercising muscle and improves peak oxygen consumption. These protracted effects of ACE-inhibitors might be due to an inhibitory effect on the vascular renin angiotensin system leading to a beneficial remodelling of the vessel wall. Forearm vessels of patients with heart failure do not respond adequately to acetylcholine and reactive hyperemia, indicating an impaired endothelial function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "451": "Following myocardial infarction, there are structural changes in the surviving restmyocardium, including excentric hypertrophy. These changes are called \"remodelling\". It includes hypertrophy of the terminally differentiated cardiocytes and proliferation of other myocardial cells (e.g. connective tissue). In the hypertrophied cardiocytes, the pattern of gene expression is changing towards a perinatal-like phenotype. This phenotype change is called \"dedifferentiation\" and includes (among others) several critical alterations in myocyte Ca+(+)-homeostasis and electromechanical coupling: prolongation of the action potential and thereby augmented Ca+(+)-inflow into the cardiocyte during activation; reduced expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca+(+)-ATPhase with retarded endsystolic Ca+(+)-reaccumulation into the sarcoplasmic reticulum; enhanced expression of the sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca+(+)-exchanger with enhanced Ca+(+)-export via this rheogenic, asymmetrical exchanger, this export associated with depolarizing netto-inward current. Due to this phenotype constellation, high heart rates can induce cytosolic Ca+(+)-overload, relaxation abnormalities, depressed systolic force-frequency relations, and diastolic Ca+(+)-induced Ca+(+)-release leading to late afterdepolarizations and triggering ventricular tachyarrhythmias. While the poorly differentiated cardiocytes of newborns have a phenotype similar to that in hypertrophied dedifferentiated cardiocytes of overloaded myocardium (at least in some aspects of Ca+(+)-homeostasis), the neonatal heart is protected against arrhythmias by its high intercellular coupling (high density of \"gap-junctions\") and by its lower size. In contrast, the intercellular coupling in overloaded myocardium is often heterogeneous, the density of gap junctions is globally reduced, and the conductance of gap-junctions is functionally reduced by cytosolic Ca+(+)-overload. This enhances the susceptibility for arrhythmias due to \"reentry\" as well as due to focal depolarization of multiple origins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Twenty patients with a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 120 mmHg after 2 weeks of placebo were randomised to receive, under double-blind conditions, either L/HCTZ or C/HCTZ as a single daily dose for 4 weeks. Clinical examination, laboratory tests and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were performed at the end of the placebo and active treatment periods. L/HCTZ and C/HCTZ significantly lowered SBP and DBP on occasional recordings and on ABPM. The mean fall in blood pressure on ABPM (SBP, DBP, mean of 24-hour recording, diurnal and nocturnal) at 4 weeks was greater with L/HCTZ than with C/HCTZ. Both treatments were effective for 24 hours and did not alter the circadian cycle. The clinical and laboratory safety was good. The blood pressure figures obtained by ABPM were lower than on occasional recordings, emphasising the value of this technique in the evaluation of a patient's poor response to antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "453": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular function and disease has long been recognized. The renin-angiotensin system was originally thought to be only active in the plasma as a circulating endocrine system, controlling blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. The recent introduction of new biotechnologies to cardiovascular research has demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system can operate as both an endocrine (circulating) and an autocrine/paracrine (tissue) system. The endocrine component is involved with acute circulating homeostasis, whereas it is believed that the tissue renin-angiotensin system participates in the tonic regulation of cardiovascular function and structure. Multiple lines of evidence support the presence of complete renin-angiotensin systems in the central nervous system, vasculature, adrenal, heart, kidney, and reproductive organs. Although more research is necessary to delineate the role of tissue renin-angiotensin systems in local tissue function, the significant contribution of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease is increasingly apparent (Table 1).",

The frequency of cough ranges widely (from 0.2% to 15%) in different series, being higher in small studies and smaller in retrospective studies with large number of patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the true frequency of cough induced by treatment with ACE inhibitors in Greek hypertensives and to determine various possibly correlated parameters, including sex, duration of therapy and kind and dose of ACE inhibitors. All hypertensive patients followed in our Hypertension Clinic and treated with ACE inhibitors participated in the study. A total of 228 patients, 103 males and 125 females, 24-80 years of age, were treated with ACE inhibitors for a period of 1-41 months: 121 with enalapril, 40 with captopril, 39 with lisinopril, 25 with perindopril and 3 with ramipril. During treatment with ACE inhibitors persistent dry cough occurred in 15 patients, 12 women and 3 men, giving a frequency of 6.58%. Eleven patients (4.82%) volunteered the information and three after questioning. The mean age of these 15 patients with cough was significantly higher from that of the group (n = 213) without cough (64.27 +/- 2.5 vs. 57.9 +/- 0.74 years, mean +/- SEM, P = 0.024).

    "455": "The antihypertensive activity and the influence of adrenal cortex hormones of benazepril versus captopril were studied in 30 essential hypertensives in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial during eight weeks of treatment. Patients started with 50 mg of captopril or 10 mg of benazepril once daily; if normotension had not been obtained after four weeks of treatment the doses were increased to 50 mg twice daily or 20 mg once daily, respectively. 11-Oxycorticosteroids and progesterone in males were measured in blood and daily urine at baseline and at the 4th and the 15th days of drug administration, as well as aldosterone in daily urine by radioimmunoassay, and compared with these data in 15 healthy subjects. Following eight weeks of treatment in 64% and 56% of patients treated with benazepril and captopril respectively, blood pressure was normalised. In the corresponding remaining 14% and 13%, diastolic blood pressure decreased by 10 mmHg and more but not below 90 mmHg. Before treatment excretion of 11-oxycorticosteroids, progesterone and aldosterone was significantly increased without changes in blood levels. After two weeks of treatment 11-oxycorticosteroids and aldosterone excretion decreased (P < 0.05) without progesterone changes, benazepril treatment being more effective in decreasing 11-oxycorticosteroids levels in blood (P < 0.05). In patients with high pretreatment levels of 11-oxycorticosteroids in urine we have noticed the highest antihypertensive effect of both drugs. The main conclusions are that both the ACE inhibitors are effective in mild to moderate essential hypertensives and might decrease glucocorticoids in urine and blood.", 
    "456": "The efficacy of antihypertensive agents was compared when given at different time points in the circadian rhythm. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were kept on a 12/12-h cycle with lights on/off at 07:00/19:00 h. A computerized system was used to measure intraarterial blood pressure and heart rate continuously. Agents or vehicle were intravenously injected at two time points. One at the beginning of the sleeping period, at which low efficacy was expected (T = 10), and one at T = 16, which is 3 h before the circadian peaks in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), aimed at reducing the rise in BP and HR at awakening. The hypotensive effect of propranolol, metoprolol, labetalol, prazosin, clonidine, and rilmenidine was greater when injected at T = 16 than at T = 10 (p < 0.05 for propranolol, metoprolol, and rilmenidine). In contrast, the renal vasodilators captopril and tertatolol were more potent after injection at T = 10. Felodipine was equally effective at both time points. Thus, the effects of antihypertensive agents are related to the phase of the circadian rhythm. The data on the sympatholytic agents in general and beta-blockers and centrally acting agents in particular support antihypertensive regimens with timed administrations.", 
    "457": "Although it is widely accepted that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have become a cornerstone in the treatment of congestive heart failure, controversy still exists regarding the optimal doses of these drugs to use, and important variations in the daily dose used are seen among different physicians and countries. Nevertheless, objective data indicate that the efficacy of these drugs increases with dose and that most patients with heart failure tolerate the relatively high doses that have been used in large mortality trials. Presently, therefore, and unless new contradictory data become available, every effort should be made to use high doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in heart failure patients.", 
    "458": "ACE inhibitors improve not only symptoms and signs of heart failure in patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction but also lead to a slower progression of heart failure. In asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the progression to symptomatic heart failure is retarded by ACE inhibitors. As heart failure is preceded in about 80% by myocardial infarctions, trials were designed to influence the development of heart failure after myocardial infarction. It could be shown that therapy with ACE inhibitors ameliorates the progressive left ventricular dilatation and that this effect is translated into a significant increase of life expectancy. Mainly based on the CONSENSUS I study, large doses of ACE inhibitors were used in most subsequent trials. The mean daily doses of enalapril were 18.4 mg in the CONSENSUS I trial and 16.6 and 16.7 mg in both arms of the SOLVD trial. There is a trend towards lower doses of ACE inhibitors, as in the SAVE trial only 79% of the patients taking captopril received the target dose of 150 mg daily. Smaller studies used similar target doses, but a beneficial effect on left ventricular enlargement has been shown with a daily dose of only 75 mg captopril. Based on the hypothesis that the left ventricular enlargement is mainly determined by the activation of the local cardiac renin angiotensin system, even lower, and therefore better tolerated, doses of ACE inhibitors may prove effective. However, studies comparing the effect of different doses of ACE inhibitors on left ventricular remodeling are missing. Consequently, the above-mentioned target doses of ACE inhibitors should be aimed at when treating patients after myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "460": "Tubulin and microtubules were modified with the protease, subtilisin. The modification reduced the length of alpha- or beta-tubulin by cleaving a peptide fragment from the C-terminals. Generation of alpha'beta'-tubulin, which is cleaved at both the alpha- and beta-subunit terminals, and alpha beta'-tubulin, which is cleaved at the beta-subunit C-terminal, have already been reported. In this work an isotype, alpha'beta-tubulin, was produced. The three modified tubulin isotypes were compared for their ability to interact with glycolytic enzymes. Cleavage of alpha led to a poorer interaction when tested via affinity chromatography. Tubulin also inhibits the activity of aldolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. When the alpha-subunit C-terminal was intact, inhibition was greatest. These results imply that the C-terminal of the tubulin alpha-subunit is responsible for interactions with glycolytic enzymes.", 
    "461": "Secondary cardioprotection of patients with angina pectoris can be accomplished by selecting appropriate drugs for the specific clinical setting. Calcium-antagonists are the first choice drugs in patients with vasospastic angina or in those clinical situations in which vasoconstriction plays a significant pathogenetic role. On the contrary beta-blockers reduce mortality and the probability of myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina. The beneficial effects of aspirin on survival of patients with unstable angina is also well known, whereas ACE-inhibitors reduce mortality as well as the incidence of unstable angina in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Also nonpharmacologic treatments (physical exercise, preconditioning) may have beneficial effects although their role is not well established yet.", 
    "462": "Although prevention of heart failure recently has become a realistic issue, management of heart failure once the syndrome has developed, is mainly supportive, based on the various cardiac and peripheral changes which occur in the course of heart failure. Of these, abnormal neurohormonal activation is of major pathophysiologic and prognostic significance. Consequently, modulation of neuroendocrine activation is now recognized a prime target in the treatment of heart failure, besides diuretic therapy. In this respect, the value of converting enzyme inhibition is well established. Future developments in this area include dopaminergic agents, vasopressin antagonists, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors, spironolactone and, possibly, ANF peptidase inhibitors. Besides diuretics, necessary when signs of fluid retention are present, the approach to heart failure management involves other pharmacologic issues. In view of abnormal vascular control with vasoconstriction prevailing during progressive heart failure, it clearly makes sense to vasodilate. However, of available vasodilators, only the combination of relatively high dose nitrates and hydralazine has proven to be of clinical significance, in terms of hemodynamics, exercise capacity and survival. It is possible, though, that novel generation dihydropyridine derivatives may prove beneficial as well. Thus far, there has been much debate concerning the usefulness and particularly the safety of positive inotrope therapy and inodilator treatment. Taken together, this concern relates to presence and predominance of cAMP-dependent mechanisms to induce these effects. Thus, sympathomimetic agents and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as milrinone or enoximone, are without beneficial effects, but instead shorten survival during long-term therapy. This may be different where compounds which act through cAMP-independent mechanisms, i.e., calcium sensitization or sodium channel stimulation, are concerned, but needs to be confirmed yet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "463": "The treatment of microvascular angina (anginal pain resulting from myocardial ischemia due to dysfunction of small coronary arteries) is empiric and often ineffective at present. The poor knowledge of the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the microvascular dysfunction and the possible heterogeneous nature of the disease limit the possibility of a rational therapeutic approach to these patients. The failure of traditional antiischemic therapy is confirmed by the frequent unresponsiveness of angina and by the reduced exercise tolerance with administration of sublingual nitrates. Despite that, beta-blockers and calcium-antagonists, when given either alone or in combination, are beneficial in the control of symptoms in some patients. Alternative forms of treatment, based on some pathophysiological hypotheses and clinical observations, include xanthine derivatives, ACE-inhibitors, alpha-blocking agents, imipramine and, in women, oestrogens. The actual clinical usefulness of these drugs, however, is questionable at present, as their efficacy should be evaluated with more adequate studies in the future.",

    "466": "The exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure is determined by factors including the interaction of the right and left ventricles and their respective circulations, lung mechanics, skeletal muscle metabolism, and blood flow. Therapeutic efforts should be directed at all of the units in this complex process rather than the response of an individual system. Multiple therapeutic regimens such as nitrates and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in combination with physical training and other therapies that improve pulmonary function produce optimal results. Using this holistic approach to therapy, the physician may have a beneficial impact on the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "467": "The increased incidence and prevalence of congestive heart failure place a high priority on novel treatment strategies. Left ventricular ejection fraction remains the single most valuable measurement providing both diagnostic and prognostic insights. The most systematic approach to heart failure involves an objective assessment of functional disability, to include exercise tests such as a 6-minute walk under standardized conditions. Left ventricular dysfunction incites a host of neurohumoral compensations that are of fundamental importance in the heart failure syndrome expression. Both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator neurohormones are stimulated and provide new therapeutic opportunities. The therapeutic approach to heart failure begins with a strong emphasis on prevention, patient education, and self-participation in therapy with respect to both its monitoring and adjustment. Diuretics remain a mainstay of therapy but, in the face of severe heart failure, may become ineffectual, requiring constant infusion of loop-active diuretics, combination diuretics, or diuretics in association with concomitant low-dose dopamine infusion. Vasodilator therapy has been an important advance: combination hydralazine and nitrate therapy was initially shown to be efficacious in improving survival, and more recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in the form of enalapril, have shown incremental benefit on survival over this combination. Interestingly, there is now evidence from both SOLVD and SAVE to demonstrate an unexpected and, as yet, unexplained reduction in the frequency of both unstable angina and myocardial infarction. Although, on balance, the weight of evidence concerning the long-term efficacy of inotropic agents has been disappointing, especially as it relates to their unfavorable effects on survival, recent information on vesnarinone, an agent with a complex and diversified mechanism of action, suggests that with appropriate doses, improved symptoms and survival are possible. A substantial amount of new information from randomized placebo-controlled trials attests to the symptomatic relief, hemodynamic improvement, and gain in exercise performance achieved by digoxin. A long-term survival study is ongoing to assess its effects on mortality. beta-Blockers, especially metoprolol, appear beneficial in some patients with heart failure, possibly related to their reduction in sympathetic nervous activity and restoration of beta-receptor population, with resultant improved contractile performance, enhanced myocardial relaxation, and overall increase in cardiac efficiency. Based on available evidence, the best contemporary approach to treatment involves the use of ACE inhibitors coupled with diuretic therapy, either continuous or intermittent, to relieve central or peripheral congestion. The addition of digoxin or a hydralazine nitrate combination is a logical next step, with commencement of low-dose beta-blocker a reasonable option.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "469": "We compared cardiovascular values obtained with a telemetric system simultaneously with those recorded by an externalized catheter in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We also tested the hypothesis that telemetric monitoring reduces the amount of stress associated with performance of cardiovascular studies. Femoral arterial and venous catheters were implanted under methoxyflurane anesthesia in male SHR previously implanted 38 +/- 7 days earlier with radiotelemetric devices. Rats were then allowed 1 day to recover before undergoing experimentation. Baseline blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) values obtained with the telemetric system and with the femoral arterial catheters were similar, and intravenous (i.v.) administration of phenylephrine (PE), angiotensin I (ANGI), acetylcholine (ACh), or nitroglycerin (NTG) evoked similar changes in BP and HR. Hemodynamic responses evoked by i.v. administration of nifedipine were also similar as recorded by telemetric monitoring and the femoral arterial cannula. Baseline cardiovascular parameters measured in SHR instrumented only with telemetric devices consistently yielded BP and HR values significantly lower than those recorded by tail-cuff or femoral catheters. In addition, SHR subjected to the tail-cuff procedure responded to oral administration of captopril with a greater degree of hypotension. These studies demonstrate that telemetric monitoring of cardiovascular parameters in conscious rats is a sensitive, accurate, and flexible method. The lower basal cardiovascular values and the insensitivity to the hypotensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, suggest that a decreased level of stress is associated with performance of cardiovascular studies by a radiotelemetric system.",

This model provides unique conditions with which to study the pathogenesis of altered Ca++ regulation. Normotensive (WKY) rats and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) received at 6 to 10 weeks of age either ACE inhibitor (ramipril), hydralazine/hydrochlorothiazide or no treatment. At 17 weeks of age, rats were anesthetized, and vascular tissue was excised. Thoracic aorta challenged with 20 mM caffeine in Ca(++)-free buffer produced a phasic contractile response. The magnitude of this phasic response was used as a measure of Ca++ released from intracellular stores; a direct correlation between this phasic response and systolic blood pressure was observed. A concentration-response curve to Bay K8644 was performed on carotid arteries; a direct correlation of force development to Bay K8644 and systolic blood pressure was observed. All WKY groups showed lower blood pressure and force development in response to Bay K8644 than did SHRSP. Treatment with ramipril reduced blood pressure and force development in response to Bay K8644 in adult SHRSP, although not to levels of WKY rats, whereas WKY rats were unaffected by treatment. These data support the hypothesis that contractile responses to Bay K8644 in carotid arteries and caffeine in aorta parallel changes in systolic blood pressure. We conclude that alteration of Ca++ regulation in hypertension is directly related to elevated blood pressure and mediated by an angiotensin II-sensitive mechanism during development.",

During double-blind treatment, 18 patients were withdrawn from the placebo group because of worsening heart failure compared with 5 patients withdrawn from quinapril treatment (p < 0.001). Rather than a precipitous deterioration of clinical status or early incidence of adverse events, withdrawal from quinapril was associated with steady worsening of heart failure, beginning 4 to 6 weeks after randomization to placebo.", 
    "488": "Quinapril is effective and safe for maintaining clinical stability in patients with moderate congestive heart failure. Withdrawal of quinapril from patients with heart failure results in a slow progressive decline in clinical status.", 
    "489": "Renal function declines progressively in patients who have diabetic nephropathy, and the decline may be slowed by antihypertensive drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether captopril has kidney-protecting properties independent of its effect on blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "490": "We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing captopril with placebo in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in whom urinary protein excretion was > or = 500 mg per day and the serum creatinine concentration was < or = 2.5 mg per deciliter (221 mumol per liter). Blood-pressure goals were defined to achieve control during a median follow-up of three years. The primary end point was a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration.", 
    "491": "Two hundred seven patients received captopril, and 202 placebo. Serum creatinine concentrations doubled in 25 patients in the captopril group, as compared with 43 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.007). The associated reductions in risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration were 48 percent in the captopril group as a whole, 76 percent in the subgroup with a baseline serum creatinine concentration of 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 mumol per liter), 55 percent in the subgroup with a concentration of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 mumol per liter), and 17 percent in the subgroup with a concentration of 1.0 mg per deciliter (88.4 mumol per liter). The mean (+/- SD) rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 11 +/- 21 percent per year in the captopril group and 17 +/- 20 percent per year in the placebo group (P = 0.03). Among the patients whose base-line serum creatinine concentration was > or = 1.5 mg per deciliter, creatinine clearance declined at a rate of 23 +/- 25 percent per year in the captopril group and at a rate of 37 +/- 25 percent per year in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Captopril treatment was associated with a 50 percent reduction in the risk of the combined end points of death, dialysis, and transplantation that was independent of the small disparity in blood pressure between the groups.", 
    "492": "Captopril protects against deterioration in renal function in insulin-dependent diabetic nephropathy and is significantly more effective than blood-pressure control alone.", 
    "493": "The role of hypertension in the pathogenesis of renal damage is a subject of both historical interest and current investigation. Because of the difficulty associated with studying the pathophysiologic role of glomerular injury in systemic hypertension, experimental models have provided much of the data in this field. The mechanisms leading to glomerular injury are complex and not fully elucidated. Mesangial and endothelial cell injury are thought to be important pathophysiologic mechanisms in the renal injury associated with hypertension. One hypothesis suggests that glomerular hypertension (ie, a hemodynamic event) is the primary pathogenetic mechanism, but another supports the notion that glomerular hypertrophy (ie, abnormal growth-related events) contributes to injury. The intrarenal renin-angiotensin system may play an important pathogenetic role in end-stage renal disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to arrest the progression of renal injury in animal models. Although the clinical database is incomplete, the findings of anecdotal reports and short-term studies suggest that ACE inhibition may preserve renal function in patients with scleroderma renal crisis, reduce proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy, and normalize renal hemodynamics in patients with a variety of renal diseases. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibition may be due to both hemodynamic (eg, reduction in glomerular capillary and intraglomerular pressures) and nonhemodynamic (eg, potassium-sparing and reduction in mesangial proliferation) mechanisms. The precise role of ACE inhibitors in the prevention of renal damage awaits the results of ongoing long-term, double-blind clinical studies. Nevertheless, ACE inhibition may be an appropriate therapeutic alternative in the hypertensive patient whose renal injury is progressing despite aggressive antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "494": "The patients' well-being during antihypertensive treatment markedly influences their compliance. Therefore, in the last several years the effect of antihypertensive medications on the quality of life has been examined all over the world. The terminological and methodical problems at the field of quality of life resulted in difficulties regarding the comparison of the results of different working groups. This review is focused on the results of randomised, double-blind studies. We found that ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and selective beta blockers have the most beneficial effect on the quality of life."
